<text>The 72nd United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, consisting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from March 4, 1931, to March 4, 1933, during the last two years of Herbert Hoover&#x27;s presidency. The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1910 United States census. The Senate had a Republican majority. The House started with a very slim Republican majority, but by the time it first met in December 1931, the Democrats had gained a majority through special elections.
== Major events ==
* Ongoing: Great Depression
* January 12, 1932: Hattie Wyatt Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the United States Senate. (Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia had been appointed to fill a vacancy in 1922; the 87-year-old Felton served one day as a senator.) Caraway had won a special election to fill the remaining months of the term of her late husband, Senator Thaddeus Caraway. She won re-election to a full term in 1932 and again in 1938 and served in the Senate until January 1945.
* July 28, 1932: Bonus Army was dispersed.
* November 8, 1932: 1932 United States elections:

<text>Kontsert (; Russian: Концерт, ; commonly read as Kohuept or Kohliept, ) is the second live album by Billy Joel, released in 1987. The album was recorded during the Soviet leg of Joel&#x27;s 1987 &quot;The Bridge&quot; tour. This album was co-produced by Jim Boyer and Brian Ruggles and mixed by Jim Boyer.

== Background ==
In 1986 Billy Joel was invited to perform in the Soviet Union the following year, 1987. Joel took advantage of this opportunity to be a musical ambassador. He was seen as a &quot;nice, safe, first attempt at bringing in an American &#x27;pop star.&#x27;&quot;

== The concert ==
The tour of the Soviet Union consisted of six shows, three in Moscow and three in Leningrad. Joel brought his family with him to show the Russians that he felt safe and trusted the Russian people. During the show Joel gave new meanings to songs such as &quot;Honesty&quot;. Each time the song was performed, he dedicated the song to Vladimir Vysotsky, because he was an inspirational Russian man who &quot;spoke the truth.&quot;

During the second of the three concerts performed in Moscow at the Olympic Sports Complex, Joel flipped his electric piano and broke his microphone stand on his grand piano. While performing &quot;Sometimes a Fantasy&quot;, the audience kept getting attention from spotlights, which angered Joel as he felt it was making it harder to connect with them, because crowd members on whom lights shone would suddenly become silent and still. He yelled, &quot;Stop lighting the audience!&quot; He then trashed his instruments, overturning his piano and breaking his mic stand; neither he nor the band stopped performing despite this. He later claimed that &quot;People like their privacy. They go to a concert to get that, to be in the dark and do their own thing.&quot;

Joel brought his daughter Alexa Ray Joel and his wife Christie Brinkley on tour with the band. He also crowd-surfed during his performances. While in Leningrad, Billy dove into the crowd during the performance of &quot;The Longest Time&quot;. This was another way for him to show that he trusted the Russian people.

Joel had played a tour in Europe prior to the tour in the Soviet Union and was being interviewed during the day. As a result, his voice became hoarse. Joel himself stated that he was disappointed by the album and believed his vocals were not up to par during its production. Despite his opinion, Columbia Records released the album, claiming it was a &quot;historic event&quot;. Joel and his band jokingly refer to the album as &quot;Kaput&quot;.

== Impact ==
Prior to this show, rock music was barely gaining ground in the Soviet Union. The implementation of Gorbachev&#x27;s glasnost allowed people of the Soviet Union to witness Western rock. As a result, the government had to learn how to put on concerts, while the people of Russia had to learn how to participate in them. Joel&#x27;s Russian tour was the first live rock radio broadcast in Soviet history. Joel and his band were one of the first Western rock groups to perform in Russia, along with John Denver, Elton John, James Taylor, and Santana.

While in Russia, Billy Joel and his daughter Alexa met and became friends with a clown named Viktor. The song &quot;Leningrad&quot; would eventually be written about him. This song was released on the 1989 &quot;Storm Front&quot; album.

Joel went on to say: The trip to Russia was probably the biggest highlight for me as a performer. I met these people and they weren&#x27;t the enemy. I also hoped that the people in America could see what we did. What happens when your kid says to you &#x27;what did you do in the Cold War, Daddy?&#x27; And now we have something to say.

==&quot;Kontsert&quot; track listing==


== &quot;A Matter of Trust: The Bridge to Russia&quot; ==
On May 19, 2014, the album was re-released and retitled as &quot;A Matter of Trust: The Bridge to Russia&quot;, a two-CD, one-DVD/Blu-ray set incorporating eleven previously unreleased tracks on CD and seven previously unreleased and restored songs on video. In addition, the DVD/Blu-ray set contains a newly produced documentary of the same name which features updated interviews with Joel&#x27;s current and former band members as well as personnel involved with the original 1987 production. &quot;Superfans are likely to drool over the deluxe edition which includes a book with accounts from writers and journalists who were on the road with Joel during the tour,&quot; Charles Pitter at &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote.&quot;

<text>As a political term, social imperialism is the political ideology of people, parties, or nations that are, according to Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin, &quot;socialist in words, imperialist in deeds&quot;. Some academics use this phrase to refer to governments that engage in imperialism meant to preserve the domestic social peace.

== Political use ==
The term &quot;social imperialism&quot; is a Marxist expression, typically used in a derogatory fashion. The phrase was first used in Marxist circles during the early 20th century discussions on the position of the international workers&#x27; movement towards the impending European war and particularly in regard to the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In this context it is very similar to, but not interchangeable with, the terms social chauvinism and social patriotism.

In the later decades the most significant use of the phrase has been in the Maoist critique of the Soviet Union. Mao Zedong argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Albanian leader and Chinese ally Enver Hoxha agreed with Mao in this analysis, before later using the expression to also condemn Mao&#x27;s Three Worlds Theory amid the Sino-Albanian split.

== Academic use ==
The term has also been used by left-wing academics, especially in regard to modern German history. The academic use of the phrase is usually to describe governments that engage in imperialism meant to preserve the domestic social status quo. The left-wing German historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler has defined social imperialism as &quot;the diversions outwards of internal tensions and forces of change in order to preserve the social and political status quo&quot;, and as a &quot;defensive ideology&quot; to counter the &quot;disruptive effects of industrialization on the social and economic structure of Germany&quot;. Under Wehler&#x27;s view, social imperialism was a device that allowed the German government to distract public attention from domestic problems and preserve the existing social and political order. Wehler argued that the dominant elites used social imperialism as the glue to hold together a fractured society and to maintain popular support for the social &quot;status quo&quot;. Wehler argued German colonial policy in the 1880s was the first example of social imperialism in action, and was followed up by the Tirpitz Plan for expanding the German Navy starting in 1897. In this point of view, groups such as the Colonial Society and the Navy League are seen as instruments for the government to mobilize public support. The demands for annexing most of Europe and Africa in World War I are seen by Wehler as the pinnacle of social imperialism.

The British Marxist historian Geoff Eley contends that there are three flaws to Wehler&#x27;s theory of social imperialism. The first is that Wehler credits leaders such as Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz and Prince Bernhard von Bülow with a greater degree of vision than what they in fact possessed. The second is that many of the pressure groups on the right who advocated an imperialist policy for Germany were not the creations of the government, and in fact often demanded far more aggressive policies than what the government was willing to undertake. The third was that many of these imperialist lobbying groups demanded a policy of political and social reform at home, in addition to imperialism abroad. Eley argued that what is required in thinking about social imperialism is a broader picture with an interaction from above and below, and a wider view of the relationship between imperialism abroad and domestic politics.

One of the more notable uses of the social imperialism concept was by the British Marxist historian Timothy Mason who argued that World War II was caused by social imperialism. In Mason&#x27;s opinion, German foreign policy was driven by domestic political considerations, and the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a &quot;barbaric variant of social imperialism&quot;. Mason argued that &quot;Nazi Germany was always bent &quot;at some time&quot; upon a major war of expansion&quot;. However, Mason states that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy. According to Mason, by 1939, the &quot;overheating&quot; of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans caused by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and a sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing. Mason contended that, when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis, the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless &quot;smash and grab&quot; foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany. Mason described German foreign policy as driven by an opportunistic &quot;next victim&quot; syndrome after the &quot;Anschluss,&quot; in which the &quot;promiscuity of aggressive intentions&quot; was nurtured by every successful foreign policy move. In Mason&#x27;s opinion, the decision to sign the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and to attack Poland, and with it risking a war with Britain and France, was an abandonment by Hitler of his foreign-policy programme, outlined in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and &quot;Zweites Buch&quot;, and was forced on him by the need to seize and plunder territory abroad in order to prevent the collapse of the German economy. Mason&#x27;s theory of World War II as an act of social imperialism and as a sudden &quot;flight into war&quot; into 1939 was to involve him in the 1980s in a debate with the British historian Richard Overy.

<text>Guillermo Haro Barraza (; 21 March 1913 – 26 April 1988) was a Mexican astronomer. Through his own astronomical research and the formation of new institutions, Haro was influential in the development of modern observational astronomy in Mexico. Internationally, he is best known for his contribution to the discovery of Herbig–Haro objects.

==Early life==
Haro was born in Mexico City on 21 March 1913 to Ignacio Haro and Leonor Barraza. He studied philosophy and law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). While working as a reporter for &quot;Excélsior&quot;, Haro became interested in astronomy after a 1937 interview with Luis Enrique Erro. As a result of his dedication and enthusiasm for astronomy, he was hired by Erro in 1943 as an assistant at the newly founded Observatorio Astrofísico de Tonantzintla. Erro arranged for Haro to further his astronomical training in the United States at the Harvard College Observatory, Case Observatory (1944), Yerkes Observatory and McDonald Observatory (1945 to 1947).

==Career==
Upon his return to Mexico in 1945, Haro continued working at the Observatorio Astrofísico de Tonantzintla where he was responsible for the commissioning of the new 24-31-inch Schmidt camera and where he became involved in the study of extremely red and extremely blue stars. In 1947 he started working for the Observatorio de Tacubaya of the UNAM.

Haro&#x27;s contributions to observational astronomy, Among them were the detection of a large number of planetary nebulae in the direction of the Galactic Center and the discovery (also independently done by George Herbig) of the nonstellar condensations in high density clouds near regions of recent star formation (now called Herbig–Haro objects). Haro and co-workers discovered flare stars in the Orion nebula region, and later on in stellar aggregates of different ages. 

Other major research projects carried out by Haro included the list of 8746 blue stars in the direction of the north galactic pole published jointly with W. J. Luyten in 1961. Work made with the 48-inch Palomar Schmidt using the three-color image technique developed at Tonantzintla. At least 50 of these objects turned out to be quasars (which had not yet been discovered in 1961). Haro&#x27;s list of 44 blue galaxies, compiled in 1956, was a precursor to the work of Benjamin Markarian and others in searching for such galaxies. Haro also discovered a number of T Tauri stars, one supernova, more than 10 novae, and one comet.

==Major accomplishments==
Haro was very influential in the development of astronomy in Mexico, not only by virtue of his own astronomical research but also by promoting the development of new institutions. In a more important aspect he defined modern astrophysical research in Mexico where he gave impulse to different initial lines of research and established general scientific policies. 
Guillermo Haro discovered a new type of large nebulae with American colleague George Herbig - that were named Herbig-Haro objects.

Haro became a member of the Colegio Nacional at age 40, the youngest person to do so.

In 1959, Haro became the first person from Mexico elected to the Royal Astronomical Society. His students included Silvia Torres-Peimbert and Manuel Peimbert.

Haro founded the Mexican Academy of Sciences (first president 1960) and the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (an observatory named after him is in the state of Sonora).

==Recognition==
Galaxy Haro 11 (H11) is a small galaxy situated in the southern constellation of Sculptor and is named after Haro who first included it in a study published in 1956.

The &quot;Guillermo Haro International Program on Advanced Astrophysical Research&quot; at INAOE, which was created in August 1995, was named after him.

On 21 March 2018, 105 years after his birth, Google featured Haro in a Google Doodle.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Haro married journalist and writer Elena Poniatowska, with whom he had two children: Felipe and Paula. He was previously divorced from his first wife, Gladys Learn Rojas.

Haro died on 27 April 1988 in Mexico City, and is interred at the Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres of the Panteón Civil de Dolores.

==Career==
In high school, Watsuki received an honorable mention in the 33rd Tezuka Awards for his 1987 one-shot &quot;Teacher Pon&quot;, which he wrote under the pen name &quot;Nobuhiro Nishiwaki&quot;. &quot;Hokuriku Yūrei Kobanashi&quot; earned him the Hop Step award. It was included in &quot;Hop Step Award Selection&quot; volume 6 in 1991. After graduating, Watsuki moved to Tokyo and worked as an assistant to Yōichi Takahashi and Takeshi Obata. Watsuki worked on Obata&#x27;s &quot;Mashin Bōken Tan Lamp-Lamp&quot; and &quot;Chikara Bito Densetsu&quot;, the former&#x27;s title character would later serve as a model for Sagara Sanosuke.

Watsuki then created three historically set samurai-themed one-shots; &quot;Crescent Moon in the Warring States&quot;, and two sharing the title &quot;Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot;. Set in the Sengoku Jidai era of Japan&#x27;s warring states, &quot;Crescent Moon in the Warring States&quot; relates the tale of the lone swordsman Hiko Seijūrō. The first &quot;Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot; features Himura Kenshin stopping a crime lord from taking over the Kamiya family dojo. The second sees Kenshin saving a young girl who is being held ransom by fallen samurai. These three works served as the basis for his first serial; &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot;, which follows the former hitokiri Himura Kenshin and was serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1994 to 1999. It was a major success with over 70 million copies in circulation, and was adapted into an anime television series, several animated films, and a trilogy of live-action films. The story &quot;Haru ni Sakura&quot;, included in the &quot;Kenshin Kaden&quot; guidebook, details the fates of the main cast of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; following its conclusion. In &quot;Yahiko no Sakabatō&quot;, set five years after the conclusion of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, Myōjin Yahiko must save the daughter of a dojo master from an old foe.

During &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;″s serialization, Watsuki wrote &quot;Meteor Strike&quot;, a one-shot written for a &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; artists project. It chronicles the what-if adventures of a young boy who is struck in the head by a meteor and gains superhuman powers, eventually saving his town from a nuclear disaster. Watsuki felt disgusted with the work and originally did not plan on revealing it, but ultimately decided to include &quot;Meteor Strike&quot; in the final &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; volume to increase its page count. Although, he said that after reading the story over again it &quot;relaxed&quot; him &quot;in a nice way.&quot; Watsuki included three main elements in the story, which he described as having &quot;some different flavors&quot; than &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. He had wanted to use meteors in a story for a long time, since they are the &quot;most energetic natural phenomena.&quot; His second element was a boy wearing a pair of white gloves. Watsuki described white gloves as &quot;sort of plain&quot; and &quot;not cool at all,&quot; yet he considers the element to be one of his favorites since the gloves &quot;give off a sense of strength.&quot; His third element is the girl wearing a construction site helmet. The helmet is masculine, while the Japanese school uniform that the girl wears is feminine. Watsuki said that he created the main character Shinya &quot;on the spot,&quot; giving him too much honesty, and a personality that overlaps with that of Himura Kenshin, which he regrets &quot;a little.&quot; Watsuki created Chiho, the other major character, to show the &quot;shojo theme of the moment&quot; when the boy out-matures the girl. Watsuki felt that the plan &quot;didn&#x27;t work out so well&quot; and &quot;a lot wasn&#x27;t what I wanted it to be.&quot; He added that he liked portraying the &quot;helpful nature&quot; of Chiho.

In 2001, Watsuki created his second serialized work, the western &quot;Gun Blaze West&quot;. The story follows Viu Bannes, a young gunfighter on his journey towards Gun Blaze West, the place where the greatest gunmen go to test their strength. It ran in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; for less-than a year, from January 8 to August 13, 2001. Its three volumes were published in English by Viz.

His third serialization &quot;Buso Renkin&quot;, was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; between July 7, 2003, and May 9, 2005, with two special chapters published in &quot;Akamaru Jump&quot;. Watsuki is married to author . She has assisted her husband in writing several of his manga including &quot;Buso Renkin&quot;, which she later wrote two novelizations of. Watsuki described himself as &quot;pro-dōjinshi&quot; and asked fans to send fan comics. &quot;Buso Renkin&quot; became his second work to be adapted into an anime. Both the manga and anime were released in English by Viz Media.

Watsuki wrote two one-shots for &quot;Jump the Revolution!&quot;, &quot;Embalming -Dead Body and Bride-&quot; on November 1, 2005, and &quot;Embalming II -Dead Body and Lover-&quot; on November 1, 2006, that would become his fourth serial. &quot;Embalming -The Another Tale of Frankenstein-&quot; began in the debut issue of &quot;Jump SQ&quot; on November 2, 2007, and concluded on April 4, 2015. Kaworu Kurosaki again assisted him with the story. It draws largely from Mary Shelley&#x27;s famed 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and follows a young man named Fury Flatliner, who was turned into a Frankenstein in order to destroy all the others and specifically seeks the one that killed his parents.

Between 2012 and 2013, Watsuki put &quot;Embalming&quot; on hold to write &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot; in &quot;Jump SQ&quot;. This &quot;reboot&quot; depicts the battles that are featured in the first live-action &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; film. Its two collected volumes were published in English by Viz Media. It was the first of several returns to the author&#x27;s most famous series. &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration Act Zero&quot; was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in August 2012 as a prologue to &quot;Restoration&quot; and included in its first volume. The two-part &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Master of Flame&quot;, which shows how Shishio Makoto met Komagata Yumi and formed the Juppongatana, followed in &quot;Jump SQ.&quot; in 2014. From August 9–11, 2013, an exhibit of art from &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; was displayed at Otakon in the United States curated by Watsuki&#x27;s wife. Watsuki and his wife collaborated on the two-chapter &quot;Rurouni Kenshin Side Story: The Ex-Con Ashitaro&quot; for the ninth anniversary of &quot;Jump SQ.&quot; in 2016. The second chapter revealed that the story is a prequel to a new arc of the series; &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc&quot; which began in fall 2017.

===Child pornography charges===
In November 2017, police found DVDs with footage of naked girls in their early teens in Watsuki&#x27;s Tokyo office. Tokyo Police raided Watsuki&#x27;s home as part of an investigation into the purchase of child pornography. The search uncovered about a hundred child pornography DVDs. He was referred to prosecutors over possession of child pornography on November 21. The serialization of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc&quot; was put on hiatus after the details of Watsuki&#x27;s charges were made public. In February 2018, Watsuki was fined (about ). &quot;The Hokkaido Arc&quot; resumed serialization in June 2018.

==Influences and inspirations==
Watsuki started drawing from the influence of his older brother. He named Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Black Jack&quot; as his favorite manga and Takeshi Obata as his favorite artist. Other series that influenced him include Fujiko F. Fujio&#x27;s &quot;Doraemon&quot; and &quot;Pa-man&quot;, Mitsuru Adachi&#x27;s &quot;Touch&quot;, &quot;Wing Man&quot; by Masakazu Katsura, Minako Narita&#x27;s &quot;Alien Street&quot; and &quot;Cypher&quot;, and &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; by Yoshihiro Togashi. Watsuki said that he is not very good at writing comedy, but stated that he does not give up on it because laughter contains &quot;smiles and happiness, the greatest common denominators.&quot;

Watsuki based many of his characters on historical figures, characters from other manga/anime, and video games series. For example, Himura Kenshin was based on Kawakami Gensai, one of the Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu. Four years after the revolution ended, Gensai was falsely accused of a crime and was executed. Watsuki admires Kenshin for his desire to do good in honor of those whom he had to kill so the Meiji Government could exist. In addition, Saitō Hajime was based on the historical Saitō Hajime, a member of the Shinsengumi although Watsuki admitted altering him to the point of fan complaints. Several other characters, most notably Sagara Sanosuke, Shinomori Aoshi, and Seta Sōjirō, are also loosely based on certain figures among the Shinsengumi. Okita Sōji, Ōkubo Toshimichi, and Katsura Kogorō are among numerous other historical figures who make appearances in the story. Yukishiro Enishi&#x27;s minion Gein was based on grave robber and double murderer Ed Gein.

<doc id="1033370" wikidata="Q1435154" url="?curid=1033370" title="Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station">
<text>The Taum Sauk pumped storage plant is a power station in the St. Francois mountain region of Missouri, United States about south of St. Louis near Lesterville, Missouri, in Reynolds County. It is operated by Ameren Missouri.

The pumped-storage hydroelectric plant was constructed from 1960–1962 and was designed to help meet daytime peak electric power demand. It began operation in 1963. Electrical generators are turned by water flowing from a reservoir on top of Proffit Mountain into a lower reservoir on the East Fork of the Black River. At night, excess electricity on the power grid is used to pump water back to the mountaintop.

The Taum Sauk plant is an open-loop pure pumped operation: unlike some other pumped storage sites, there is no natural primary flow into the upper reservoir available for generation. It is therefore a net consumer of electricity; the laws of thermodynamics dictate that more power is used to pump the water up the mountain than is generated when it comes down. However, the plant is still economical to operate because the upper reservoir is refilled at night, when the electrical generation system is running at low-cost baseline capacity. This ability to store huge amounts of energy led its operator to call Taum Sauk &quot;the biggest battery that we have&quot;. An unusual feature is the upper reservoir which is constructed on a flat surface, requiring a dam around the entire perimeter.

On December 14, 2005, a catastrophic failure in the upper reservoir dam put the plant out of operation until it was rebuilt, recertified, and reopened on April 21, 2010. The new upper reservoir dam, rebuilt from the ground up, is the largest roller-compacted concrete dam in North America.

==Size and location==

The upper reservoir can hold about of water behind a wall nearly tall. It sits above the 450 MW hydroelectric plant, which gives it a greater head than that of Hoover Dam. The two are connected by a tunnel bored through the mountain.

The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sits on ridge just below the summit of Proffit Mountain, not Taum Sauk Mountain, which is about to the east. It is visible from Route 21 north of Centerville and from Route N approaching Johnson&#x27;s Shut-ins State Park from the south.

Before the failure of the upper reservoir, visitors could drive to the top of Proffit Mountain and walk to an observation deck above the reservoir. Ameren operated a museum at the entrance gate highlighting the geologic and natural history of Missouri. The power plant was frequently visited by geology students because of a striking example of Precambrian/Cambrian unconformity in the rock layers exposed by the plant&#x27;s construction.

==History==
===Site selection===
In 1953, the Union Electric Company began to look for a site on which to build a new pumped storage plant. By 1958, company officials had decided to focus on sites with at least of vertical head, which would allow them to use a smaller storage reservoir. Union Electric hired Sverdrup-Parcel &amp; Associates to evaluate potential sites in the St. Francois Mountains, which were chosen for their relative proximity to St. Louis (where Union Electric was based) and the favorably large elevation differentials (some approaching ).

Sverdrup-Parcel &amp; Associates intended to recommend Taum Sauk Mountain as the site, in part because it was the highest point in Missouri at , but strong political opposition to development of the scenic mountain (which was later incorporated into a state park) ruled it out. The nearby Proffit Mountain ended up being an excellent alternative thanks to its comparable elevation (, the 6th-highest point in Missouri), its close proximity to the East Fork of the Black River, and the reasonably short distance of to the existing power transmission grid.

===Construction===
Construction on Taum Sauk began in 1960. The construction team consisted of Fruin-Colnon Construction and the Utah Construction and Mining Company. It went into operation in 1963 with two reversible pump-turbine units that could each generate of power. It was not licensed by the US Federal Power Commission (the predecessor of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) because Union Electric contended that the FPC did not have jurisdiction over the non-navigable headwaters where the power station was constructed. In FPC v. Union Elec. Co., 381 U.S. 90 (1965), the United States Supreme Court held that the FPC did have jurisdiction and that Taum Sauk did require a FPC license. Although designed and built without federal supervision, a license was retroactively granted.

At its completion, the Taum Sauk plant was by far the largest pumped storage plant in North America in a number of measures, and was considered a major milestone in the development of pumped storage technology. Its pump-turbines were the largest ever produced at the time of construction, it had an unusually high head (the highest in the US at the time, far surpassing all previous US pumped storage projects), a large storage capacity (it has been described as &quot;the first of the large capacity pumped-storage stations to begin operation in the United States&quot;), black start capability, and had the unique ability to be operated either remotely by remote human operators in off-site facilities located 90–120 miles away (at St. Louis or Osage Power Plant/Bagnell Dam) or even fully automatically with zero human intervention. Taum Sauk was also the first pure pumped storage plant in the United States.

===Upgrades===
The pump-turbine units were uprated in July 1972 from their initial rating of 175 MW each to 204 MW each, increasing the plant&#x27;s overall rating from 350 MW to 408 MW.

From 1998–1999, the turbine runners for both units were upgraded, resulting in improved flow rates and another power uprate to 225 MW per unit (450 MW total).

Minor leaks in the reservoir led to the construction of a collection pond and pumpback station to collect and return leaked water to the reservoir. Later, to reduce leakage, Geo-Synthetics installed lining material in the reservoir itself from September 13 to November 15, 2004.

The plant was named an IEEE Milestone in October 2005, just months before the upper reservoir failed. It was subsequently rededicated as an IEEE Milestone in 2010 after the new upper reservoir dam was completed.

=== 2005 upper reservoir failure ===


At 5:12 a.m. on December 14, 2005, the northwest side of the upper reservoir was overtopped when water continued to be pumped from the lower reservoir after the upper was full. This led to the catastrophic failure of a triangular section of the reservoir wall and the release of of water in 12 minutes. The sudden release sent a crest of water northwest of the reservoir about down the ridge to the East Fork of the Black River inside the north upstream side of Johnson&#x27;s Shut-Ins State Park. The river at the park is normally very shallow with rapids running over granite boulders. The flood destroyed many of the structures in the park and forced the closing of the trail connecting it to Taum Sauk Mountain.

A combination of design and construction flaws, continuing to operate the dam when the primary system for gauging the water level was known to be inaccurate (gauge pipes had become detached), moving the &quot;failsafe&quot; secondary gauging system above the actual height of the dam to avoid false positives, and operating the dam in an unsafe manner by routinely overfilling the reservoir caused the upper reservoir dam to overtop. There was no overflow spillway in the original reservoir.

A memo from Richard Cooper, superintendent of hydroelectric plant, indicated that the reservoir had a &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; style overflow on September 27 at the same spot that was breached (caused by wave action related to winds from Hurricane Rita). Another Cooper memo had also indicated that Cooper had warned that gauges used to monitor the water height in the reservoir were malfunctioning in October.

No one was killed by the failure. The superintendent of Johnson&#x27;s Shut-Ins and Taum Sauk State Parks, Jerry Toops, his wife and three children were swept away when the wall of water obliterated their home. They survived, suffering from injuries and exposure. The children were transported to a hospital in St. Louis and later released. One child was treated for severe burns which resulted from heat packs applied by rescue workers as treatment for hypothermia.

The flood continued downstream on the East Fork of the Snake River to the dam on the river supplying the Lower Reservoir for plant. The dam of the lower reservoir, which by design is able to hold much of the capacity of the upper reservoir, withstood the onslaught of the flood. By storing most of the deluge it spared towns downstream, including Lesterville and Centerville, from a damaging flood. A voluntary evacuation order was issued for those areas, but there was no damage. The high water was totally stopped at Clearwater Lake below the Lower Reservoir, the dam of which was not damaged by the rising waters.

====Litigation and investigations====

The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) fined Ameren US$15 million pursuant to a settlement for the breach at Taum Sauk—a US$10 million civil penalty combined with the requirement to pay US$5 million into interest-bearing escrow in order to fund a variety of &quot;project enhancements at or near the Taum Sauk project&quot;. The US$15 million fine was the largest fine in FERC&#x27;s history, 30 times larger than the previous record fine of US$500,000.

The State of Missouri sued Ameren for &quot;actual and punitive damages&quot; alleging Ameren was reckless in its operation of the plant.

In 2006, Ameren settled with the Toops family, stating it would pay restitution to the injured family while withholding the terms of the settlement.

The Missouri Highway Patrol delivered a report of its criminal investigation to the Missouri Attorney General in June 2007 which &quot;did not name any suspect&quot; and the attorney general made a statement that there would be no criminal charges. According to press reports, the report states that Ameren failed to provide the identity of the person who raised the gauges meant to prevent overtopping and also states that the gauges were moved before investigators were on the scene.

KMOX radio in St. Louis reported that the US Environmental Protection Agency assisted by the US Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri had begun an investigation into violations of the Clean Water Act and has requested the Missouri Highway Patrol&#x27;s report.

The Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC) reopened its investigation and subsequently found the accident to be a failure of Ameren management, stating:
...the Commission can only conclude that the loss of the Taum Sauk plant was due to imprudence on the part of UE (Ameren&#x27;s AmerenUE Subsidiary). UE was well aware of the catastrophic results likely to occur if the UR (Upper Reservoir) was overtopped by over-pumping. UE knew, or should have known, that storing water against the parapet wall of a rockfill dam was &#x27;unprecedented&#x27;. UE knew, or should have known, that operating with a freeboard of only one or two feet left no margin for error and required particularly accurate control of the UR water level. Given that circumstance, UE&#x27;s decision to continue operating Taum Sauk after the discovery of the failure of the gauge piping anchoring system and the consequent unreliability of the piezometers upon which the UR control system was based is frankly beyond imprudent – it is reckless. UE also knew or should have known that the upper Warrick probes had been reset above the lowest point at the top of the UR.&quot; (PSC Report page 71, definitions of Acronyms added)
Ameren had 90 days from the date of the report to tell the PSC how it will meet the recommendations of the report, which include a whistleblower rule, changes in safety management structure, financial accounting for the rebuild of the upper reservoir, and single point of management for the rebuild.

 Ameren was reported to have paid a total of close to US$200 million in settlements related to the 2005 breach.

=== Reconstruction ===

Water was pumped into the rebuilt reservoir for the first time on February 27, 2010, and engineers monitored the response of the new structure as the water level was repeatedly raised and lowered. The final approval required from the FERC for &quot;return to normal project operations&quot; was received on April 1, 2010. The utility met the Missouri Public Service Commission’s in-service criteria for operations on April 15, and electricity was first generated from the new structure on April 21, 2010. The new dam was recognized by the United States Society on Dams with its &quot;Award of Excellence in the Constructed Project&quot;. On September 27, 2010, IEEE rededicated the plant as an IEEE Milestone.

<doc id="1033373" wikidata="Q7865734" url="?curid=1033373" title="USAF Hunter-Killer">
<text>Hunter-Killer is an unofficial project name based upon an &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; article. The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Hunter-Killer program was a tactical unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) procurement program. The General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, a variant of the MQ-1 Predator won the project and was deployed in Afghanistan.

The term “HK” or Hunter-Killer was used in the 1984 film &quot;The Terminator&quot; to describe autonomous, twin-ducted fan UAS capable of identifying and destroying targets.

==History==
This is the U.S. Air Force program for which several companies have developed vehicles.

Although the J-UCAS concept is a long way from the early idea of a &quot;reusable cruise missile&quot;, that notion is apparently alive and well.

=== Lockheed Martin Minion ===
In September 2003, an announcement was made that Lockheed Martin&#x27;s &quot;Skunk Works&quot; was developing a stealthy air-launched UCAV named &quot;Minion&quot;. Its radar cross section is smaller than that of the F/A-22 Raptor (return smaller than a marble) and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Details released describe it as having a launch weight of and able to carry a reconnaissance payload, a jammer system, a high-power microwave weapon, or four GPS-guided small-diameter bombs. It could also be used as a decoy, though it would need to have radar-enhancement payload as it is described as extremely stealthy.

Range is given as up to 1,000 nautical miles (1,850 kilometers). Two would be carried into combat by a single strike fighter such as a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, with one under each wing, and launched from standoff distances to attack heavily defended targets. In practice, two strike fighters are expected to be used, launching four Minions, with the pilot of one aircraft watching out for threats while the other directs the UCAVs over a line-of-sight communications link. After the mission, the Minions would return to base and land conventionally on retractable landing gear.

A vague picture released with the announcement showed the Minion to have a certain broad resemblance to various air-launched cruise missiles, such as the Anglo-French Matra-BAe Dynamics APACHE / Storm Shadow or the US AGM-158A Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), which is also built by Lockheed Martin and may have some degree of commonality with the Minion. The picture showed the Minion to have a spikelike, square-sided fuselage, with pop-out wings and twin tailfins, with the engine inlet just forward of the tailfins and the exhaust just behind the tailfins. Both the intake and the exhaust are shielded by triangular covers.

Despite the stealthiness of the Minion, Lockheed Martin is designing it for low cost, to be substantially cheaper than the $400,000 JASSM. Rumors about a Skunk Works project involving a cruise-missile-like UCAV had been circulating for a year or two before the announcement. There were also very vague and unconfirmed rumors that the Minion was used in an operational evaluation during the invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003.

=== Other designs ===
Somewhat more visibly, in the summer of 2004, the Air Force, in need of a less expensive short-term UCAV solution with a focus on endurance, opened up a competition for a &quot;Hunter-Killer&quot; UCAV. Specifications include:

* An operating altitude of 10.7 to 15.25 kilometers (35,000 to 50,000 ft).
* Endurance from 16 to 30 hours or more carrying a warload of , in specific six guided bombs.
* Fit of SAR/MTI or EO/IR sensors and laser target designator. Of course, the Hunter-Killer would be capable of performing surveillance or reconnaissance missions along with its active combat role.

Cost specifications were given as US$10 million per aircraft and $30 million per &quot;system&quot;, with each system including two aircraft and the necessary support gear. The Hunter-Killer program has attracted considerable interest and a number of interesting proposals.

Northrop Grumman has come up with two concepts. The first is the &quot;Model 395&quot;, a militarized version of the Scaled Composites Proteus modified to a pure UAV configuration, with a sensor turret under the nose and a SAR-MTI pod under the forward fuselage, and carrying munitions on the centerline, for example tandem triple racks to carry six munitions. With reduced fuel, it could even carry a single bunker buster. At maximum takeoff weight, it would have a ceiling of .

The other Northrop Grumman proposal is effectively a half-weight Global Hawk, the &quot;Model 396&quot;, with a wingspan of , a length of , and a gross weight of , half that of the Global Hawk. It would be powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney 545 bizjet turbofan.

General Atomics offered the turboprop-powered Predator B for the role. Aurora Flight Sciences and Israel Aircraft Industries are offering an armed Heron II. Lockheed Martin has responded to the Air Force request but has been keeping quiet about their proposals. Boeing did not submit a proposal, stating the company was busy with other UCAV work.

Raytheon proposed a sixth option, whereby they would offer a combination of sensors, communications systems, and other mission-related systems as a package, and then choose an airframe at a later date. Raytheon&#x27;s perspective was that, as long as it performs to a minimum set of specifications, the individual airframe is less important than the systems it will carry.

The Air Force wanted to field the Hunter-Killer by 2007 and may order up to 60 machines. The program seems focused to avoid &quot;gold plate&quot;, and most of the avionics will likely be off-the-shelf.

<doc id="1033374" wikidata="Q1546799" url="?curid=1033374" title="GrimSkunk">
<text>GrimSkunk is a rock band from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, influenced by punk, rock, progressive and world music. Their style is self-described as &quot;world punk&quot;. They are regarded as being part of the foundation of the Quebec alternative scene, having influenced many young musicians and bands.

The band integrates many languages into its songs, such as French, English, Spanish, Greek and Persian. It has also integrated many styles of music, including punk rock, hardcore, reggae, progressive and psychedelic rock, ska, rap and world music.

Over the years, the band shared the stage with many prominent acts such as System Of A Down, Meshuggah, Manu Chao and Suicidal Tendencies, as well as peers Anonymus, Vulgaires Machins, Deadly Apples and The Sainte Catherines. They have toured extensively, including concerts on four continents.

== History ==
GrimSkunk was formed in November 1988 from a previous hardcore group known as Fatal Illness. GrimSkunk played its first show in May 1989 in St. Hyacinthe. The band&#x27;s first demo album, &quot;Autumn Flowers&quot;, was released two years later, in April 1991. Along with Groovy Aardvark, the band was among the first &quot;alternative&quot; bands to tour Quebec, thus creating a market for this genre.

In the first years of GrimSkunk&#x27;s career, cannabis was always very present in the band&#x27;s image. Hemp leaves were on their CD covers, and references to cannabis could be found in the albums&#x27; names (&quot;Autumn Flowers&quot;, &quot;Exotic Blend&quot;), in their songs&#x27; titles (&quot;Zig-Zag&quot;), and in their lyrics (&quot;Pourquoi, pourquoi ne pas fumer? / C&#x27;est ben légal de boire&quot;, &quot;Why, why can&#x27;t we smoke / Isn&#x27;t it legal to drink?&quot;). The band&#x27;s name itself is an allusion to skunk cannabis.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Meltdown&quot;, was released in 1996.
In 1997, the band&#x27;s longtime manager and friend, Simon Gallipeault, was killed in a &quot;hit-and-run&quot; longboard accident involving a car. The band became self-managed with Franz Schuller as the main &quot;mouthpiece&quot;. The 1998 album, &quot;Field Trip&quot;, is dedicated to Gallipeault and his voice is sampled before the track &quot;Live For Today&quot;.

The bass guitarist, Marc-Boris St-Maurice, left in 1999 to become an activist in the marijuana legalization movement, founding the Bloc Pot and the Marijuana Party of Canada. Tod Wirschem replaced Saint-Maurice for a few years. He has since been replaced by Vince Peake, the former Groovy Aardvark singer and bass guitarist.

The band took a break in 2000 after the keyboardist, Joe Evil, suffered serious burns from a fire in his apartment.

In 2002, the band released its seventh album, &quot;Seventh Wave&quot;, which was not well received by certain critics and fans who did not like the musical change in direction.

In 2002, GrimSkunk performed its first and only unplugged show in Saint-Roch Church in Quebec City.

In 2006, the band released &quot;Fires Under the Road&quot;, which marked a return to the sound of the earlier albums. They recorded &quot;Set Fire&quot;! in 2012 in Sydney, Australia. The album was produced by Gus Van Go and Werner F. In 2018, they released their ninth album &quot;Unreason in the Age of Madness&quot; which includes songs about the National Rifle Association of America, Donald Trump, the impact of technology.

== Indica Records ==
In 1997, GrimSkunk members founded an independent Montreal-based record label &quot;Indica Records&quot; following the bankruptcy of the band&#x27;s former label Cargo Records. From then on, all of the band&#x27;s albums were released on that label, which also helped to promote local alternative bands.

<doc id="1033385" wikidata="Q1981865" url="?curid=1033385" title="My Mother the Car">
<text>My Mother the Car is an American fantasy comedy that aired for a single season on NBC between September 14, 1965, and April 5, 1966. Thirty episodes were produced by United Artists Television. The premise features a man whose deceased mother is reincarnated as an antique car, who communicates with him through the car radio.

&quot;My Mother the Car&quot; had an experienced production team with extensive comedy credentials: Rod Amateau (&quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; and &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;); Allan Burns (wrote for Jay Ward and went on to create several critically acclaimed shows, including &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Rhoda&quot;, and &quot;Lou Grant&quot;); James L. Brooks (&quot;Room 222&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot;, and later served as executive producer of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) and Chris Hayward (produced and wrote for &quot;Barney Miller&quot; during its first several seasons).

Critics and adult viewers panned the show. In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; proclaimed it to be the second-worst television show of all time, behind &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;. TV Land&#x27;s first day of programming in April 1996 included the series premiere as a collection of television firsts and rarities, billing it as &quot;the strange but true...infamous series&quot;.
==Synopsis==
The show follows the exploits of attorney David Crabtree (played by Jerry Van Dyke) who, while shopping at a used-car lot for a station wagon to serve as a second family car, instead purchases a dilapidated 1928 Porter touring car. Crabtree hears the car call his name in a woman&#x27;s voice. The car turns out to be the reincarnation of his deceased mother, Gladys (voiced by Ann Sothern). She talks (only to Crabtree) through the car&#x27;s radio: the dial light flashes in synchronization with &quot;Mother&#x27;s&quot; voice. In an effort to get his family to accept the old, tired car, Crabtree brings it to a custom body shop for a full restoration. The car is coveted by a fanatical collector named Captain Manzini (Avery Schreiber), but Crabtree purchases and restores the car before Manzini can acquire it.

For the rest of the series, Crabtree is pursued by the avaricious Captain Manzini, who is determined to acquire the valuable automobile by hook or by crook. In a running gag characterizing his shifty nature, Manzini (who resembles a 1920s silent film villain) always mangles Crabtree&#x27;s name when speaking to him. &quot;Now, then, Crabapple...&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s Crabtree.&quot; &quot;Whatever.&quot;

Others in the cast included Maggie Pierce as wife Barbara, Cindy Eilbacher (the sister of Lisa Eilbacher) and Randy Whipple as the kids, Cindy and Randy. Veteran movie and television character actors played supporting roles, including Bill Daily, Harold Peary, Byron Foulger, Bob Jellison, Sam Flint, and Willis Bouchey.

==Production notes==
The show was created by Allan Burns and Chris Hayward, who had better success with &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, and &quot;Get Smart&quot; (which debuted the same season). Aluminum Model Toys (AMT), a well-known producer of plastic model car kits, introduced a -scale kit of the Porter in late 1965.

The theme music was composed and conducted by Ralph Carmichael, with lyrics written and sung by Paul Hampton. It was used on an episode of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; also called &quot;My Mother, the Car&quot;.

The show began with a black-and-white pilot, which was later refilmed in color. The pilot did not originally air, but has been shown several times on Canadian television. Network censors insisted that one particular scene be deleted where the car backfired.

===Car===
The on-set car, called a &quot;1928 Porter Stanhope&quot; touring car, was a custom car, rebuilt by Norm Grabowski, from a 1924 Ford Model T, and later restyled by property master Kaye Trapp and Norm Breedlove. A stunt car, driven by a rear-floorboard-hidden driver, was built by George Barris as a replica. The actual Porter Motor Company existed briefly in 1900-1901 and made an automobile only in the runabout style, not the stanhope or touring car style.

The on-set car used in &quot;My Mother the Car&quot; was, in 2016, located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and owned by Dave Bodnar. The stunt car was once owned by casino giant William Harrah, who had one of the largest special-interest and antique auto collections of all time in Reno, Nevada. After Harrah&#x27;s death in 1984, the auction catalogue advertised the car as having a carnation red body with white top and created from parts of a Ford Model T, a Maxwell, a Hudson and a Chevrolet. Harrah&#x27;s F.R.P. is, since 1994, at the Seal Cove Auto Museum on Mount Desert Island in Maine. As of 2012, the stunt Porter was at the Star Cars Museum in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. On September 3, 2017, the car sold at the Dragone auction, part of the Historic Festival 35 at Lime Rock Park in Lakeville, CT, for $50,000.

==Soundtrack==
The series was scored by Ralph Carmichael with the lyrics of the title song by Paul Hampton. Sammy Davis Jr. did a cover version.

==Critical reception==
A review of the show by John Sinnott on DVD Talk reported that although &quot;the concept is pretty stupid&quot; and that the show &quot;has gained a reputation for being one of the worst shows to ever air on American TV,&quot; it is &quot;actually not that bad,&quot; noting that &quot;Jerry Van Dyke does a very good job,&quot; &quot;the pretty and perky Maggie Pierce was also very good,&quot; and it &quot;gives some decent laughs.&quot; A review of the show on &quot;Vulture&quot; described it as &quot;the epitome of dated, stupid, campy, embarrassing, lowest common denominator television,&quot; that &quot;any blatant attempts at comedy were not successful,&quot; and that this &quot;prime example of hackneyed, brainless situation comedy did not have a laugh track for most of their episodes. This helped result in a lot of really tonally confusing work.&quot;

==Episodes==
==Release==
In the United Kingdom the series debuted on ITV on 8 November 1965.

==Ownership status==
The show&#x27;s current owner is Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which bought United Artists in 1981.

<text>Homebake was an annual Australian rock festival, featuring an all-Australian lineup (with the occasional artist from New Zealand). The festival was first held on 3 January 1996 at Belongil Fields in Byron Bay, on the far north coast of New South Wales. The same year saw a second event held at the grounds of the University of Sydney.

The festival returned in January 1998 as an East Coast event happening in Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Sydney. In December of the same year, it was held again in Sydney this time at the Domain. In late 1999 the event went on the road again, but this time to only the Gold Coast and Sydney. In 2000 the festival reverted to just Sydney, and was held at the Domain every December until 2012.

Tickets for the festival regularly sold out in advance, the fastest sell out was the 2006 event which sold out on the first day of sale, but this was then dwarfed with the 2008 show selling all 20,000 tickets in less than 10 minutes.

The 2007 Homebake took place on Saturday 8 December, once again at The Domain. It was announced that the event would be 18+ for the first time in its history. Despite some protests, Homebake organisers explained on Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Hack&#x27; program that each year the all ages liquor licence was becoming harder to obtain, and compared to their research showing that attendance for the event by underagers was between 5 and 8% influenced the decision to go 18+.

The last Homebake was held in 2012, and the following year&#x27;s event was unexpectedly cancelled. The festival has not been held since, and as of now, it is unlikely to be resurrected.

===2010===

On 25 August 2010, the organisers of Homebake announced the festival would not take place in 2010, and would instead return in 2011. The organisers cited &quot;not being able to have the &#x27;planets align&#x27; to a standard we feel appropriate&quot; as a reason for cancelling the festival in 2010.

===2012===
Event organisers announced that the 2012 Homebake would be a &quot;Global&quot; edition. While the line-up for the event, scheduled for 8 December 2012, is predominantly Australasian, American band Blondie has been selected as the headlining act. Pond, Tame Impala, Kimbra, Something For Kate, Hilltop Hoods, Sonic Animation, and Birds of Tokyo are some of the other performing artists.

==After 2012==
The event was cancelled in 2013. Organizers acknowledged that there was a hiatus for 2014. It is unlikely the festival will ever return.

<doc id="1033394" wikidata="Q8017561" url="?curid=1033394" title="William Richmond (politician)">
<text>Christopher William Richmond (12 July 1821 – 3 August 1895), generally called William Richmond, was a 19th-century New Zealand politician. He held a number of Cabinet positions between 1856 and 1861. He worked as a lawyer and was appointed a senior judge.

==Early life==
Richmond was probably born in London on 12 July 1821. His father, Christopher Richmond, died when William Richmond was only ten years old, leaving William in the sole care of Maria (Lely) Wilson, his mother. He was raised in the Unitarian faith, and attended Unitarian schools. His health was always delicate, and he suffered from severe asthma throughout his life. From 1841 to 1843, he was in France, but in 1844, he began working in various law offices. He also developed a strong friendship with Richard Holt Hutton, a writer and theologian who influenced his views considerably.

==Emigration to New Zealand==
Richmond became a practising lawyer in 1847, but business was poor. James Crowe Richmond and Henry Richmond, his two younger brothers, sought better fortunes in New Plymouth, New Zealand, in 1850, and William Richmond considered joining them. On 15 September 1852, Richmond married Emily Elizabeth Atkinson, described by Joseph Hutton (father of Richmond&#x27;s friend Richard Holt Hutton) as &quot;a remarkable woman of singular intellectual power, moral earnestness and charming spontaneity of character&quot;. Shortly after their marriage, the two set out for New Zealand on the &quot; Sir Edward Paget&quot;, being joined by his mother, his sister, and Harry and Arthur Atkinson (two brothers of Emily; Harry would later become Premier). In New Plymouth, Richmond re-established his law practice, and soon became a prominent member of the local community.

==Political career==


On 5 November 1855, he was elected to represent the Town of New Plymouth electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. When Edward Stafford formed a government on 2 June 1856, Richmond accepted an invitation to become Colonial Secretary (forerunner to the modern Minister of Internal Affairs). When Henry Sewell resigned, Richmond also became Colonial Treasurer (forerunner to the modern Minister of Finance), although Sewell briefly resumed this post for two months in 1859. On 27 August 1858, he became New Zealand&#x27;s first Minister for Native Affairs, but lost this post to Frederick Weld in late 1860. He also served as Commissioner of Customs.

Politically, Richmond aligned himself with the centralist faction, believing that the power of the provinces needed to be curtailed. Richmond also believed in the need to &quot;reform&quot; Māori institutions and culture, being particularly adamant about the need to eliminate the &quot;beastly communism&quot; of common land ownership. Richmond generally had a very low opinion of Māori, considering them to be savages.

He was confirmed at the 1860 general election, which was held on 28 November. After the Stafford government fell, Richmond did not remain in Parliament for long, and he resigned on 20 January 1862. He was succeeded by Isaac Newton Watt.

==Legal career==
He established a law practice in Dunedin with Thomas Gillies, a fellow MP. He was soon appointed to a post as a senior judge, a role which he seemed to enjoy more than his former political career. In 1865, he turned down an invitation by Stafford to return to politics, despite a suggestion that he could become Premier.

During the &quot;Barton Affair&quot; of 1876–78 he was a member of the court with Chief Justice James Prendergast who imprisoned lawyer George Elliott Barton for a month for contempt of court, a ruling that split the Wellington legal profession.

Towards the end of his life, Richmond became increasingly conservative, condemning the Liberal Party&#x27;s proposals for women&#x27;s suffrage, a land tax, and an income tax.

==Family and death==
The Richmonds had five daughters and four sons. Their daughter Margaret married the surgeon Walter Fell in 1886. Richmond died in Wellington on 3 August 1895.

<doc id="1033399" wikidata="Q1707018" url="?curid=1033399" title="The Simpsons (video game)">
<text>The Simpsons is an arcade beat &#x27;em up developed and published by Konami released in 1991. It was the first video game based on the &quot;Simpsons&quot; franchise to be released in North America. The game allows up to four players to control members of the Simpson family as they fight various enemies to rescue the kidnapped Maggie. It was a commercial success in the United States, where it was one of the top three best-selling arcade video game machines of 1991, The game also features the television shows&#x27;s voice actors; Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith reprising their respective roles as the Simpsons family.

The game was ported to the Commodore 64 and MS-DOS soon after its launch in the arcades, and was released as The Simpsons Arcade Game on those platforms. It was also released under that title on Xbox Live Arcade for Xbox 360 and PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 in February 2012; however, for unknown reasons, it was removed from both services on December 20, 2013. In 2021, Arcade1Up released a 30th anniversary home arcade cabinet.

== Plot ==

While walking through downtown Springfield, the Simpsons collide with Smithers, who has just stolen a large diamond from a jewelry shop for Mr. Burns. The diamond goes flying and lands in Maggie&#x27;s mouth, and she begins sucking on it like a pacifier as Smithers kidnaps her. The rest of the Simpsons give chase across the city, fighting off hordes of enemies (hired by Mr. Burns) to reach the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The pursuit covers eight stages, each of which ends with a fight against a strong boss character. In the final stage, the Simpsons must defeat first Smithers and then Mr. Burns, who uses a mobile battle suit equipped with a variety of weapons. Once Mr. Burns is defeated, Maggie puts her pacifier in his mouth and the Simpsons take her home, with Homer throwing the diamond away.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; is a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up that allows players to join in at any time. Two different cabinet models were produced: one allowing up to two simultaneous players, each able to choose a character, and another allowing four players with a dedicated position for each character. Controls consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons to jump and attack.

The characters have distinctive attack styles; Homer punches and kicks, Marge swings a vacuum cleaner, Bart wields a skateboard, and Lisa attacks with a jump rope. Two characters standing close to each other can mount a combined attack: Homer and Marge holding each other&#x27;s ankles to roll around the screen and mow down enemies, Homer placing either kid on his shoulders so they can strike at two different heights, and Marge throwing either kid. Each player has a health meter, which decreases upon being hit by enemies; food items can be picked up to replenish it. Players can also pick up and throw/swing items such as hammers, bowling balls, and mailboxes as melee weapons. One life is lost whenever a player&#x27;s health meter runs out; if all lives are lost, the player may continue the game by adding credits within a time limit. Two minigames played between stages require players to hit their buttons as quickly as possible, with computer-controlled enemies replacing any characters not in play.

The Japanese version of the game includes many differences from the North American release. These changes include throwable small scale nuclear bombs that clear all on-screen enemies. A life bar that, unlike in the North American version, can accumulate three levels by eating food beyond the first full level. The player&#x27;s life is turned into bonus points after they complete a level and is restored when the next level begins. In this version there are hidden items (food and weapons) which appear when the player hits specific points of the screen. Also, in the Japanese version the score system is different: each enemy character defeated gives the player a certain number of points, while at the North American version the player only earns a single point by defeating them. This is similar to the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; arcade game score system.

==Legacy==
Soon after the Simpsons&#x27; arcade release, Novotrade released ports for Commodore 64 and MS-DOS computers. A listing on the Australian Classification Board website, posted on November 9, 2011, hinted at a port of the game being developed by Backbone Entertainment for multiple platforms. In January 2012, a high-definition port of &quot;The Simpsons Arcade Game&quot; was announced for PlayStation Network for release in February, with a release on Xbox Live Arcade also revealed. The port features online multiplayer, the ability to unlock the rare Japanese 4-player version of the game, and promotional content from the game&#x27;s arcade launch. The game was initially made available exclusively to PlayStation Plus users at no charge. In December 2013, the game was removed from the PlayStation Network store, although at the time it was still available through the Xbox Live Marketplace; no reason for the removal was given by either Sony or Konami.

A completely different title inspired by the arcade game, &quot;The Simpsons Arcade&quot;, was released by Electronic Arts for iOS on December 19, 2009. Unlike the arcade game, the title is a single player game where players control Homer, assisted by the other family members via power-ups. The plot is also slightly altered, as it revolves around a thumb drive containing plans for Burns&#x27; &quot;Project: Operation Mission&quot; hidden inside a donut that Homer attempted to eat after bumping into Smithers, who had been tasked with securing the plans, allegedly containing the town&#x27;s secret data. With Burns&#x27; associates retrieving the donut and taking turns keeping it safe while Homer remains ignorant of the drive inside, his objective is simply to take back the donut. But first, he must defeating Chief Wiggum before advanced to next level, before taking final showdown with Burns in his mansion.

In June 2021, Arcade1Up announced its intent to release a 30th anniversary edition home arcade cabinet in late fall the same year.

== Reception ==

In the United States, thousands of arcade cabinets were ordered upon its debut at the American Coin Machine Exposition (ACME) in March 1991. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; went on to win a Platinum award from the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) for sales achievement in 1991, making it one of the top three best-selling arcade video game machines of 1991 (with the Neo Geo MVS which won Platinum and below &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; which won Diamond). In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on their October 1, 1991 issue as being the eleventh most-popular arcade game for the previous two weeks.

The arcade game received positive reviews from critics. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; gave it a positive review, saying “It’s the great looking graphics, good sampled sound and clever animations that makes the Simpsons such fun to play“ &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; ranked the arcade game as the best cartoon-based game. The game was inducted into &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Hall of Fame.

The PC/MS-DOS version of the game was reviewed in 1992 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #180 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.

<doc id="1033414" wikidata="Q3154611" url="?curid=1033414" title="Irving Kaufman">
<text>Irving Robert Kaufman (June 24, 1910 – February 1, 1992) was a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

==Early life and education==

Born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York City, Kaufman received a Bachelor of Laws from Fordham University School of Law in 1931. Although he was Jewish, Kaufman earned the nickname &quot;Pope Kaufman&quot; for his achievement in the required Christian doctrine classes at Fordham, a Catholic school.

==Career==

Kaufman entered private practice of law in New York City from 1932 to 1935. He was a Special Assistant United States Attorney of the Southern District of New York from 1935 to 1939. He returned to private practice in New York City from 1940 to 1949. He was an Assistant United States Attorney from 1939 to 1940. He was Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States from 1947 to 1948.

===United States District Court===
Kaufman received a recess appointment from President Harry S. Truman on October 21, 1949, to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to a new seat created by 63 Stat. 493. He was nominated to the same seat by Truman on January 5, 1950. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 4, 1950, and received his commission on April 7, 1950. His service was terminated on September 22, 1961, when he was elevated to the Court of Appeals. Notable cases include:
* 1951: Kaufman is best remembered as the judge who presided over the espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and imposed their controversial death sentences. Roy Cohn, one of the prosecutors in the case, claimed in his autobiography that his influence led to Kaufman&#x27;s being appointed to the case and that Kaufman had imposed the death penalty on Cohn&#x27;s personal advice. This claim has not been verified, although it has been shown that after Kaufman learned that the FBI and Justice Department opposed death penalties in the case, he asked the prosecution to withhold its recommendation before issuing his death sentence. In his summing up Kaufman was considered by many to have been highly subjective: &quot;Judge Kaufman tied the crimes the Rosenbergs were being accused of to their ideas and the fact that they were sympathetic to the Soviet Union. He stated that they had given the atomic bomb to the Russians, which had triggered Communist aggression in Korea resulting in over 50,000 American casualties. He added that, because of their treason, the Soviet Union was threatening America with an atomic attack and this made it necessary for the United States to spend enormous amounts of money to build underground bomb shelters.&quot; Kaufman said that he had gone to synagogue to pray before issuing his death sentence; this enraged Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, who later wrote to Judge Learned Hand, &quot;I despise a judge who feels God told him to impose a death sentence,&quot; and also told Hand that he was &quot;mean enough&quot; to stay on the court long enough to prevent Kaufman from having a chance to take Frankfurter&#x27;s place in the so-called &quot;Jewish seat&quot; on the court.
* 1959: Kaufman presided over the jury trial in the federal government&#x27;s conspiracy case against 21 of the Apalachin meeting delegates. The guilty verdicts of 20 of the men, and the stiff sentences Kaufman meted out, were later reversed and invalidated by the Court of Appeals.

===United States Court of Appeals===
Kaufman was nominated by President John F. Kennedy on September 14, 1961, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to a new seat created by 75 Stat. 80. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 21, 1961, and received his commission on September 22, 1961. He served as chief judge from 1973 to 1980. He assumed senior status on July 1, 1987. His service was terminated on February 1, 1992, at his death. Notable cases included:
* 1964: Kaufman wrote the Second Circuit&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Irving Berlin et al. v. E.C. Publications, Inc.&quot;, a case that helped establish the legal precedent for the right to parody.
* 1966: Kaufman wrote an opinion in the case of &quot;United States v. Freeman&quot; 357 F.2d 606 (2d Cir. 1966). The judgment over-turned the rigid M&#x27;Naghten standard for insanity defense and adopted the modern insanity defense described in Section 4.01 of Model Penal Code developed by the American Law Institute. The judgment embraced advances in psychiatry and emphatically rejected the M&#x27;Naghten test by stating that, &quot;the outrage of a frightened Queen has for far too long caused us to forego the expert guidance that modern psychiatry is able to provide.&quot;
* 1974: Kaufman was the chief judge in the decision (&quot;Coniglio v. Highwood Services, 1974&quot;) that prevents Professional Football fans from gaining redress against the NFL&#x27;s policy requiring them to purchase seats for exhibition games at regular-season prices in order to qualify for season tickets.
* 1975: Kaufman presided over the three-judge appeals court panel reviewing the deportation of John Lennon and rejected the government&#x27;s attempt to deport him from the United States to the United Kingdom based upon his having pleaded guilty in England to possession of hashish. After a widely publicized argument, Kaufman found that Lennon had been singled out for deportation for political reasons, allowed him to remain in the United States on what some observers characterized as a technicality, and criticized what he called the &quot;labyrinthine provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.&quot;
* 1980: Kaufman also wrote an opinion in the case of &quot;Filártiga v. Peña-Irala,&quot; 630 F.2d 876 (2d Cir. 1980). The case opened U.S. courts to foreigners who were tortured in other countries. The case has had a wide-ranging impact on human rights and the role of corporations and their foreign operations.

==Death and legacy==

Kaufman died age 81 on February 1, 1992, at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan of pancreatic cancer.

On October 7, 1987, Kaufman was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan. A substantial collection of Kaufman&#x27;s personal and judicial papers is archived at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., but is not yet fully open for research. Kaufman had been known to lament what he regarded as the distortion of judicial opinion and finding, as it passed through the filter of the media: &quot;The judge is forced for the most part to reach his audience through the medium of the press whose reporting of judicial decisions is all too often inaccurate and superficial.&quot;

<doc id="1033422" wikidata="Q2844812" url="?curid=1033422" title="Solimões River">
<text>Solimões () is the name often given to upper stretches of the Amazon River in Brazil from its confluence with the Rio Negro upstream to the border of Peru. The Solimões flows for about 1,600 km (1,000 miles) through a floodplain about 80 km (50 miles) wide.

==Geography==
The Amazon / Solimões river just above the confluence of the Solimões and Rio Negro is already by far the largest river in the world, even though its two largest tributaries (the Negro and the Madeira River) have not yet contributed to the flow volume.

The Solimões portion of the Amazon River lies entirely in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, and some portion of the state is often referred to as the &quot;Solimões region&quot;. The ecoregion of the Solimões River drainage basin is entirely tropical rainforest.

==Etymology==
An Amazonian aboriginal nation called &quot;Soriman&quot; was corrupted in Portuguese to &quot;Solimão&quot; and &quot;Soliemoens&quot;, from which the name of this section of the river and the region it drains is derived.

Use of the name &quot;Solimões&quot; for the upper Amazon is mostly confined to Brazilian speakers of Portuguese; the rest of the world refers to both the upper and lower portions of the river as the &quot;Amazon&quot;.

<text>Alisma is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae, members of which are commonly known as water-plantains. The genus consists of aquatic plants with leaves either floating or submerged, found in a variety of still water habitats around the world (nearly worldwide). The flowers are hermaphrodite, and are arranged in panicles, racemes, or umbels. &quot;Alisma&quot; flowers have six stamens, numerous free carpels in a single whorl, each with 1 ovule, and subventral styles. The fruit is an achene with a short beak.

The nineteenth century British art and social critic John Ruskin believed that the particular curve of the leaf-ribs of &quot;Alisma&quot; represented a model of &#x27;divine proportion&#x27; and helped shape his theory of Gothic architecture.

 (&quot;Patrick&#x27;s leaf&quot;) is the Irish name for the water-plantain. It is reputed to ward off fairies.

Water plantains are perennial plants. These herbs are usually emergent plants high. They have broad leaves that can be either tapered or rounded at the base. When submerged, the plant produces ribbon-like leaves. Inflorescences are highly branched. They produce whorls of perfect flowers either white or pinkish. The fruits are flat-sided nutlets in length. These herbs usually flower in late May to early September, but this can vary with conditions.

Water-plantains are wetland plants and found in saturated soils and shallow water as well as marshes, wooded swamps, shrub swamps and flooded farmland. When introduced to an area, water plantain can rapidly reproduce.

<text>Didier Patrick Queloz (; born 23 February 1966) is a Swiss astronomer. He is the Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Cambridge, where he is also a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, as well as a professor at the University of Geneva. Together with Michel Mayor in 1995, he discovered 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet orbiting a Sun-like star, 51 Pegasi. For this discovery, he shared the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics with Mayor and Jim Peebles. In 2021, he was announced as the founding director of the Center for the Origin and Prevalence of Life at ETH Zurich.

== Early life and education ==
Queloz was born in Switzerland, on 23 February 1966.

Queloz studied at the University of Geneva where he subsequently obtained a MSc degree in physics in 1990, a DEA in Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1992, and a PhD degree in 1995 with Swiss astrophysicist Michel Mayor as his doctoral advisor.

In the area of religion &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reports him as saying, &quot;although not a believer himself, “Science inherited a lot from religions”&quot;.

== Career and research ==
Didier Queloz is at the origin of the “exoplanet revolution” in astrophysics when as part of his PhD at the University of Geneva, with his supervisor, they discovered the first exoplanet around a main sequence star.
In 1995 with Michel Mayor announced a giant planet orbiting the star 51 Pegasi; the planet was identified as 51 Pegasi b and determined to be of a Hot Jupiter. The planet was detected by the measurement of small periodic changes in stellar radial velocity produced by the orbiting planet. Detecting this small variability by the Doppler effect had been possible thanks to the development of a new type of spectrograph, ELODIE, installed at the Haute-Provence Observatory, combined creative approach to measuring precise stellar radial velocity.
For this achievement, they were awarded half of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star&quot; resulting in “contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth’s place in the cosmos.”

This seminal discovery has spawned a revolution in astronomy and kickstarted the research field of exoplanets. Over the next 25 years, Didier Queloz&#x27;s main scientific contributions have essentially been focused to expand our detection and measurement capabilities of these systems to retrieve information on their physical structure. The goal is to better understand their formation and evolution by comparison with the Solar System. In the course of his career, he developed new astronomical equipment, novel observational approaches, and detection algorithms. He participated and conducted programs leading to the detection of hundred planets, including breakthrough results.

Early in his career, he identified stellar activity as a potential limitation for planet detection. He published a reference paper describing how to disentangle stellar activity from a planetary signal using proxies, including new algorithms that have become standard practice in all planet publications based on precise Doppler spectroscopy data. With this work he set the foundation to optimize measurements of stellar radial velocity that is still in use today.

Queloz received the 2011 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award of Basic Sciences (co-winner with Mayor) for developing new astronomical instruments and experimental techniques that led to the first observation of planets outside the solar system.

Shortly after the start of the ELODIE planet survey at OHP, he led the installation of an improved version (CORALIE), on the Swiss 1.2-metre Leonhard Euler Telescope. Very quickly this new facility started to detect exoplanets on stars visible in the southern hemisphere. In 2000, he took the responsibility, as a project scientist, in the development of HARPS, a new type of spectrograph for the ESO 3.6m telescope. This instrument commissioned in 2003 was about to become a reference in the business of precise Doppler spectroscopy. HARPS performances, allied with the development of a new analysis software inherited from all past experiences gathered with ELODIE and CORALIE, would considerably improve the precision of the Doppler technique. Eventually, it would deliver spectacular detections of smaller exoplanets in the realm of Neptune, super-Earth systems before Kepler would massively detect them and establish their statistic occurrence.

After the announcement of the detection of the first transiting planet (in 1999), Didier Queloz&#x27;s research interest got broader with the objective to combine capabilities offered by transiting planets and follow-up Doppler spectroscopy measurements. In 2000 he achieved the first spectroscopic transit detection of an exoplanet using the so-called Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This type of measurement essentially tells us about the projected angle between the stellar angular momentum vector and the planet orbital angular momentum vector. The pinnacle of this program would be reached 10 years later, after he led a significant upgrade of CORALIE, and established a collaboration with the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) consortium in the UK. With his Ph.D. student they demonstrated a significant number of the planets were surprisingly misaligned or in a retrograde orbit, providing a new insight about their formation process. In 2017 he received the Wolf Prize in Physics 2017 for that work and all the planet discoveries he had made.

The special geometry of transiting planets combined with precise Doppler spectroscopic observations allow us to measure the mass and radius of planets and to compute their bulk densities to get insights about their physical structure. In 2003 Didier Queloz, recently appointed at a faculty position, with his research team pioneered and established the combination of these techniques by first measuring bulk density of OGLE transiting planets. They also looked for transit opportunities on known radial velocity planets and they found the first transiting Neptune-size planet Gliese 436 b. In the course of this program and a collaboration with his Colleague S. Zucker from Tel-Aviv University, they developed the mathematical foundation to compute residual noise they encountered during the analysis of transit they were trying to model. They established statistical metric to address pink noise in the data. Today this concept is widely used in the field to estimate systematics in light-curves and transit modelling.

In 2007 Didier Queloz became associate professor. Over the next 5 years following his nomination his research program based on the combination of spectroscopy and transit detection intensified. He took the lead in the spectroscopic follow-up effort of the WASP consortium and the CoRoT space mission. The combination of WASP and Corot data with follow-up observations using EulerCam (CCD imager ), CORALIE spectrograph, HARPS spectrograph, and other main ESO facilities was amazingly successful. It led to more than 100 publications, some of them breakthroughs providing new insights on the formation and nature of hot Jupiter-type planets. Further, in the same period, the detection of COROT-7b combined with an intensive follow-up campaign established the first planet detection with a bulk density similar to a rocky planet.

All follow-up expertise he developed naturally extended to the Kepler space telescope era with HARPS-N consortium confirming the Earth-like bulk density of Kepler-10. On the ground-based transit programs, Didier Queloz was deeply involved in the design and installation of a new generation of survey telescope: the NGTS Observatory. His role was decisive during system tests in Europe and to establish the facility at the Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.

At the time Didier Queloz moved to the University of Cambridge, he essentially focused his activity to set up a comprehensive research activity directed to the detection of Earth-like planets and life in the Universe, and to further develop the exoplanet community in UK. When he left Switzerland, he was co-directing a major national initiative which eventually got funded. At Cambridge with the help of his colleagues of the IoA and DAMTP he established the Cambridge Exoplanet Research Centre to stimulate joint coordinated efforts and collaborations between departments. In UK he organized the first “Exoplanet community meeting” and installed the idea of a regular yearly “community” workshop. In the European context, he is leading at Geneva (through his joint Professor appointment) the development of the ground segment CHEOPS space mission and he chairs the science team.

His most recent research highlights are related to the search for transiting Earth-like planets on low mass stars and Universal life. This program, carried out in collaboration with M. Gillon from the University of Liège, is at the origins of the detection of TRAPPIST-1, a planetary system potentially interesting to further search for atmosphere and life signature. Another successful avenue of research is the characterization of the rocky surface or atmosphere of hot small planets with the work on 55 Cancri e. The recent extension of this program towards “Life in the Universe” is carried out in the context of an international research initiative supported by the Simons Foundation. The highlight result of this collaboration is the definition – combining chemistry and astrophysical constraints – of minimum conditions for the origins of RNA precursors on exoplanets (“abiogenesis zone”).

Discoveries of exoplanets attract a lot of attention from the public and media. In parallel to his research and teaching activities, Didier Queloz has participated in numerous documentaries, movies, articles, and TV and radio interviews to share the excitement, and to explain results and promote interest in science in general.

He was also a visiting scientist at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research in 2019.

In October 2019, related to his work in astronomy and exoplanet discoveries, Queloz predicted humans will discover extraterrestrial life in the next 30 years, stating, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe we are the only living entity in the universe. There are just way [too] many planets, way too many stars, and the chemistry is universal. The chemistry that led to life has to happen elsewhere. So I am a strong believer that there must be life elsewhere.&quot;

In December 2019, Queloz took issue with those who are not supportive of helping to limit climate change, stating, “I think this is just irresponsible, because the stars are so far away I think we should not have any serious hope to escape the Earth [...] Also keep in mind that we are a species that has evolved and developed for this planet. We’re not built to survive on any other planet than this one [...] We’d better spend our time and energy trying to fix it.”

<doc id="1033435" wikidata="Q16387158" url="?curid=1033435" title="Much Obliged, Jeeves">
<text>Much Obliged, Jeeves is a comic novel by P. G. Wodehouse, published in the United Kingdom by Barrie &amp; Jenkins, London, and in the United States by Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., New York under the name Jeeves and the Tie That Binds. Both editions were published on the same day, 15 October 1971, which was Wodehouse&#x27;s 90th birthday.

&quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot; is the penultimate novel featuring Wodehouse&#x27;s characters Jeeves and Bertie Wooster. Taking place at Brinkley Court, the home of Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia, the story involves Florence Craye and her fiancé Ginger Winship, Roderick Spode and his fiancée Madeline Bassett, and the Junior Ganymede club book, which is full of confidential and valuable information.

The two editions have slightly different endings. The book&#x27;s American editor Peter Schwed changed the ending slightly and gave the US edition a new title. In the British version, when Jeeves reveals he has destroyed Bertie&#x27;s pages from the Junior Ganymede&#x27;s book as Bertie wanted, Bertie merely says, &quot;Much obliged, Jeeves.&quot; In the American version, Bertie instead asks Jeeves why he destroyed the pages; Jeeves answers that no other valet will ever need to see the pages, because he will be Bertie&#x27;s valet indefinitely, as there is a &quot;tie that binds&quot; between them.

==Plot==

Jeeves types a report of Bertie&#x27;s latest misadventures for the club book of the Junior Ganymede Club, in which the club&#x27;s members are required to record information about their employers, to inform those seeking employment about potential employers. Bertie worries that his embarrassing information will fall into the hands of his judgmental Aunt Agatha and asks Jeeves to destroy the pages about him, but Jeeves asserts that the book is secure and refuses to defy the rules of his club.

An old school friend of Bertie&#x27;s, Ginger Winship, is standing for the House of Commons in a by-election at Market Snodsbury, near the home of Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia, Brinkley Court, on the wishes of his strict fiancée. Aunt Dahlia persuades Bertie to come to Brinkley to assist in the canvassing. Before departing, Bertie has drinks with Jeeves at the Junior Ganymede. They discuss how Ginger&#x27;s chances for election will be hurt if the public learns about his rowdy past (mild by Bertie&#x27;s standards but potentially offensive to the traditional rural populace of Market Snodsbury). At the club, they see an uncouth ex-valet that Bertie once employed, Bingley, who greets Jeeves in an overly familiar fashion, calling him &quot;Reggie&quot;.

At Brinkley, he discovers Ginger&#x27;s fiancée is the overbearing Florence Craye, who has previously been betrothed to several people, including Bertie. Florence mistakenly believes that Bertie still wants to marry her, and Bertie&#x27;s personal code prevents him from telling her otherwise. The intimidating Roderick Spode, 7th Earl of Sidcup has come to deliver speeches for Ginger, and he has brought &quot;his&quot; fiancée, Madeline Bassett. Like Florence, Madeline thinks Bertie wants to marry her and Bertie is too polite to correct her.

Also present is L. P. Runkle, a financier and collector, who is visiting Brinkley to sell a silver porringer worth nine thousand pounds to Bertie&#x27;s uncle Tom Travers (who has fled Brinkley Court to avoid the guests). Runkle was the employer of the late father of Bertie&#x27;s friend Tuppy Glossop, and profited from Tuppy&#x27;s father&#x27;s invention, leaving little for Tuppy and his father. Dahlia wants to soften up Runkle and get him to pay Tuppy his due so Tuppy can finally marry his fiancée, Angela, Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s daughter.

Ginger&#x27;s chances for election (and thus his engagement to Florence) are threatened by Bingley, who has purloined the Junior Ganymede club book. Bingley intends to sell its pages about Ginger to his opponent or to the local newspaper. To prevent this, Jeeves pays Bingley a social visit, taking the opportunity to slip him a Mickey Finn and recover the book.

Surprisingly, this does not please Ginger. After disappointing Florence in his performance at the Council meeting, he no longer wants to marry her, and has fallen in love with his secretary, Magnolia Glendennon. Like Bertie, Ginger is prevented by his personal code from telling a woman he does not want to marry her. To spur Florence to break the engagement, Ginger wants the local newspaper to print the club book&#x27;s pages about him, but Jeeves is unwilling to part with the book. Meanwhile, Spode is entranced by the reception he is getting at his speeches for Ginger, and thinks of renouncing his title and running for the Commons himself. This upsets Madeline, who wants to become a Countess. Madeline considers marrying Bertie instead of Spode.

Aunt Dahlia, failing to convince Runkle to give Tuppy any money, has stolen the silver porringer he wished to sell to Tom. Bertie tries to return the porringer, but is caught, and hides the object in his bureau drawer. At the candidate debate, Ginger, following Jeeves&#x27;s advice, endorses his opponent and resigns the race. Havoc ensues between the opposing sides, and those present, including Spode and Florence, are pelted with produce. Florence breaks her engagement with Ginger, and he promptly elopes with Magnolia.

Bingley (in Runkle&#x27;s employ) discovers the missing porringer in Bertie&#x27;s drawer, and Runkle accuses Bertie of the theft. While Bertie faces jail time, this has the positive effect of keeping Florence from trying to marry Bertie. Spode realises he would prefer to stay in the produce-free House of Lords and chooses to keep his title. He and Madeline reconcile.

Finally, Jeeves reveals secrets about Runkle written about him by Bingley in the club book, preventing him from pressing charges against Bertie, and also forcing him to give Tuppy his legacy. Noting that Bingley was able to steal the club book, Bertie again asks Jeeves to destroy the eighteen pages that Jeeves wrote about Bertie. Jeeves states that he has already done so.

==Style==

Generally, Bertie makes use of words and phrases he learned from Jeeves throughout the series, while Jeeves does not repeat terminology introduced by Bertie. The sole exception to this pattern occurs in &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;. In chapter 12, when Bertie asks Jeeves about the odds against Aunt Dahlia getting money from Runkle, Jeeves searches for a way to describe Runkle, trying to recall a term used previously by Bertie to describe tough antagonists like Spode:

&quot;It is on the tip of my tongue.&quot;&quot;A stinker?&quot;No, he said, it wasn&#x27;t a stinker.&quot;A tough baby?&quot;&quot;No.&quot;&quot;A twenty-minute egg?&quot;&quot;That was it, sir. Mr. Runkle is a twenty-minute egg.&quot;

Jeeves repeats the phrase in chapter 15, when Bertie remembers that Jeeves put the odds at a hundred-to-one:

&quot;Approximately that, sir.&quot;&quot;Runkle being short of bowels of compassion.&quot;&quot;Precisely, sir. A twenty-minute egg.&quot;

This unique reversal of the verbal relationship between Jeeves and Bertie highlights the reversal created in the book between their usual positions. Ordinarily, Jeeves does not make mistakes and is ultimately rewarded by Bertie in some way; in this novel, Jeeves makes a mistake believing that the club book is secure while Bertie predicts correctly that the book will be used for blackmail, and Jeeves rewards Bertie in the end by destroying the eighteen pages he had recorded about Bertie in the book.

Wodehouse frequently repeats the same information in two or more ways for comic effect. One way this occurs is when Bertie employs two or more virtually synonymous words when only one is necessary. In chapter 4, Bertie uses a reference book belonging to Jeeves to come up with a flood of synonyms to emphasize Bingley&#x27;s effrontery toward Bertie and Jeeves at the Junior Ganymede Club:

As to his manner, I couldn&#x27;t get a better word for it at the moment than &quot;familiar&quot;, but I looked it up later in Jeeves&#x27;s Dictionary of Synonyms and found that it had been unduly intimate, too free, forward, lacking in proper reserve, deficient in due respect, impudent, bold and intrusive. Well, when I tell you that the first thing he did was to prod Jeeves in the lower ribs with an uncouth finger, you will get the idea.

In all of the Jeeves novels, one of Bertie&#x27;s primary goals is to avoid marriage, making Bertie an inversion on the typical hero of romantic comedies whose ultimate goal is to become engaged or married. Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia concisely summarizes the recurring threat of marriage that Bertie is repeatedly faced with in the penultimate chapter of &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;, when she has heard the news about Spode changing his mind after being hit by a potato. Furthermore, the same passage places undue emphasis on how neatly things have worked out and mentions a &quot;guardian angel&quot;, hinting that Jeeves may have thrown the potato or arranged for someone to throw the potato at Spode:

A look almost of awe came into the ancestor&#x27;s face.&quot;How right you were,&quot; she said, &quot;when you told me once that you had faith in your star. I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of times you&#x27;ve been definitely headed for the altar with apparently no hope of evading the firing squad, and every time something has happened which enabled you to wriggle out of it. It&#x27;s uncanny.&quot;&lt;br&gt;She would, I think, have gone deeper into the matter, for already she had begun to pay a marked tribute to my guardian angel, who, she said, plainly knew his job from soup to nuts, but at this moment Seppings appeared and asked her if she would have a word with Jeeves, and she went out to have it.

Bertie is shown to have an idealistic nature, which contrasts with Jeeves&#x27;s more pragmatic views. This is illustrated in chapter 15, when Bertie tries to persuade Aunt Dahlia to return a silver porringer because stealing it was a breach of hospitality, while Jeeves merely states that no useful end will be accomplished by retaining the object. The unscrupulous Bingley&#x27;s behaviour suggests to some degree what Jeeves might be like if he were entirely amoral (Jeeves, like Bingley, uses the club book for blackmail purposes), and shows how Bertie&#x27;s innocence redeems the dishonorable tactics used by Jeeves by giving them an altruistic and honorable goal.

==Background==
The earliest surviving notes for the novel are dated 10 December 1966. According to the notes, Wodehouse planned for &quot;some crook butler&quot; to steal the Junior Ganymede club book, and considered having this butler threaten to reveal the information in the book about Bertie to Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Agatha in order to get him to undertake some dreadful task.

Revisions to an early typed draft of the novel show that Wodehouse made many small changes to make the language more humorous, a process which Wodehouse&#x27;s American editor Peter Schwed termed &quot;adding the laugh lines&quot;. For instance, Wodehouse added &quot;I feel full to the brim of Vitamin B&quot; to Bertie&#x27;s dialogue near the beginning of the first chapter.

Schwed changed the ending of &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot; for the American edition because he believed that Jeeves would not damage the club book by tearing out Bertie&#x27;s pages &quot;without a rational explanation&quot;, and drafted a longer Wodehouse-style ending, in which Jeeves explains that the book&#x27;s entry on Bertie is unnecessary because he will remain permanently with Bertie. Wodehouse worked Schwed&#x27;s version into the ending of the American edition, which uses the title suggested by Schwed, &quot;Jeeves and the Tie That Binds&quot;.

Bingley was introduced under the name &quot;Brinkley&quot; in the 1934 novel &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;. In &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;, Bertie initially does call him &quot;Brinkley&quot;, though Jeeves soon corrects him. This use of retroactive continuity regarding the character&#x27;s name was apparently due to the potential for confusion with this story&#x27;s setting at Brinkley Court.

This novel is significant as it is the first time in the Wooster canon that Jeeves&#x27; first name (Reginald) is revealed.

==Publication history==

The novel was included in the 1976 three novel collection titled &quot;Jeeves, Jeeves, Jeeves&quot;, along with How Right You Are, Jeeves and Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, which was published by Avon.

==Reception==

* Richard Armour, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; (23 January 1972): &quot;Despite the basic sameness of the Wodehouse books, each is somehow fresh and different. And this is one of the freshest and fastest moving. There is no use trying to tell what it is about, except perhaps that it involves a club for butlers to which Jeeves belongs, and a club book into which Jeeves has written some rather personal things about his employer. If it should get out (as of course it does) it would be a little like the Pentagon Papers. But it isn&#x27;t the plot but what Wodehouse does with it in his sprightly way of writing&quot;.
* John K. Hutchens, &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; (12 February 1972): &quot;Inquire of any good Wodehousian what his hero&#x27;s newest book is &#x27;like,&#x27; and the fellow will stare at you as if you were the idiot you must be to ask such a question. It is like &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, like &quot;Bertie Wooster Sees It Through&quot;, like &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot;, and like all their magnificent company in its rippling, apparently effortless narrative, its uninsistent comedy of word play and wildly plausible situation, its characters who could not conceivably be confused with anyone else&#x27;s characters or with one another&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Television===
The story was adapted into the &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; episode &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; which first aired on 20 June 1993. This was the last episode in the series. There are some changes to the plot:
* In the episode, the ex-valet who stole the Junior Ganymede club book is still called Brinkley. The setting is Totleigh Towers, not Brinkley Court.
* Runkle and Aunt Dahlia are absent, while Aunt Agatha and Sir Watkyn Bassett are present at Totleigh Towers in the episode.
* Jeeves does not use a drug to incapacitate Brinkley in the episode. Bertie steals the book back while Jeeves is conversing with Brinkley. Brinkley steals it back, but then Florence obtains the club book and believes that it is a work of fiction authored by Brinkley.
* In the episode, Bertie inadvertently becomes engaged to both Florence Craye and Madeline Bassett simultaneously. Bertie breaks up with Florence by informing her that he is engaged to Madeline, and Jeeves finds a damaging secret about Spode (involving a kangaroo called Celia), forcing him to reclaim his title and reconcile with Madeline.
* In the episode, Tuppy, at Bertie&#x27;s request, comes to Totleigh with a huge drain pumper called &quot;Plumbo Jumbo&quot; to unclog the pipes. When Spode chases Tuppy off the premises, the Plumbo Jumbo is left running, and ultimately the pipes erupt, spraying everyone in the chapel during Madeline and Spode&#x27;s wedding ceremony, causing them to angrily chase both Bertie and Jeeves counterclockwise around the chapel. In the original story, Tuppy is not present and a wedding ceremony did not occur.

<text>Barbara Calandra Moore (1952 – March 11, 2010) was a United States diplomat who served as United States Ambassador to Nicaragua.

Moore was nominated to be Ambassador to the Republic of Nicaragua by President George W. Bush in May 2002. She arrived in Nicaragua September 12, 2002 and presented credentials to President Enrique Bolaños on September 13, 2002.

Moore was a career member of the Senior Foreign Service, class of Minister Counselor. She joined the United States Information Agency in 1974. Her most recent assignment before being nominated as Ambassador to Nicaragua was as Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá, Colombia (1998–2002), where she played a major role in the conception and implementation of Plan Colombia.

<text>Fantasies &amp; Delusions is the thirteenth and final studio album composed by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released in 2001. His only studio album to contain classical compositions, it features his longtime friend, the British-Korean pianist Richard Hyung-ki Joo, performing compositions written by Joel. It was Joel&#x27;s 19th album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching No. 83 in October 2001. The album debuted at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s Top Classical Albums chart.

&quot;Fantasies &amp; Delusions&quot; was originally recorded at Cove City Sound Studios, Glen Cove, New York, with help from veteran production coordinator Bill Zampino and Richie Cannata; later, the album was re-recorded in Vienna, Austria, for final release.

== Critical reception ==
In January 2002, Gramophone UK called the album a &quot;pleasing‚ undemanding sequence of ‘classical’ pieces from one of pop’s giants.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the album is a &quot;nice collection of pleasingly modest, melodic solo piano pieces.&quot; He added that Joel succeeds on it because &quot;he kept his ambitions reasonable and was smart about presentation&quot; while retaining the &quot;recognizable melodic flair&quot; of his pop work. At the end of his review, Erlewine concluded that the tracks &quot;are not pieces that you&#x27;ll wind up humming&quot; but among &quot;the best in recent memory.&quot;

==Track listing==

#Opus 10. Air (&quot;Dublinesque&quot;) – 3:46

==&quot;Symphonic Fantasies for Piano and Orchestra&quot;==
In 2003, pianist Jeffrey Biegel approached Joel about a commission for a piano concerto. As an alternative, Joel suggested that Biegel create a piano concerto using pieces from &quot;Fantasies and Delusions&quot;. Biegel did so, using four of the pieces: &quot;Fantasy (Film Noir)&quot;, &quot;Sorbetto&quot;, &quot;Reverie (Villa d&#x27;Este)&quot;, and &quot;Nunley&#x27;s Carousel Waltz&quot;. After Biegel had written the piano part, Nashville composer Philip Keveren composed the orchestral parts. The work, titled &quot;Symphonic Fantasies for Piano and Orchestra&quot;, premiered on June 24, 2006 in Greensboro, North Carolina. Biegel was the pianist, accompanied by the Eastern Philharmonic Orchestra led by Stuart Malina.

<text>The Mirage was a casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States. The 65-acre property included a casino and 3,044 rooms.

Golden Nugget, Inc., led by developer Steve Wynn, purchased the future land of the Mirage in 1986. A hotel-casino, the Castaways, occupied a portion of the property and was demolished to make way for the Mirage. The resort opened on November 22, 1989, after two years of construction. It was the world&#x27;s most expensive resort, completed at a cost of $630 million. It was also among the world&#x27;s largest hotels. The Mirage was the first megaresort to open on the Las Vegas Strip, and its success prompted a building boom in the 1990s for other large resorts along the Strip.

The Mirage opened with several non-traditional attractions for a Las Vegas casino, including animal habitats for dolphins and tigers, and an indoor tropical forest display. Its primary attraction was an artificial volcano that erupted nightly, providing free entertainment in front of the resort. In 1990, the Mirage debuted a magic show by Siegfried &amp; Roy, who performed there for nearly 14 years. The resort also hosted Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s first Las Vegas show, &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot;, which opened in 1992. Cirque du Soleil would return to the property in 2006, with the debut of &quot;Love&quot;, a show featuring music by the Beatles.

Wynn departed the Mirage in 2000, when his company was bought by MGM Grand. Vici Properties acquired the property in 2022 and continues to own it, while Hard Rock International took over operations later that year, becoming the first tribal gaming operator on the Strip. Hard Rock intends to rebrand the resort as Hard Rock Las Vegas. The property will receive a complete renovation and expansion which will include a new guitar-shaped hotel tower, taking the place of the volcano attraction. The Mirage closed on July 17, 2024, and is expected to reopen under its new name by May 2027.

==History==
===Background===
A portion of the Mirage property was once occupied by a nightclub known as the Red Rooster. It opened in 1930, on what would become the Las Vegas Strip. The following year, it became the first Strip business to receive a gaming license. It was later purchased by actress Grace Hayes in 1947, and became the Grace Hayes Lodge. It was demolished in 1959, although Hayes continued living in a house located on the property. Another portion of the land was occupied by a hotel-casino known as the Castaways.

Casino owner Steve Wynn had considered building a resort on the Strip to be known as Victoria Bay, but the project was canceled in 1981, due to high costs. Three years later, he thought about building a resort in downtown Las Vegas, on 50 acres of railroad land that would later become the site of the Clark County Government Center. Wynn&#x27;s plan to build in downtown were scrapped after the railroad declined his $50 million offer for the land, asking twice that amount.

Wynn eventually purchased the Castaways and nearby acreage in October 1986. Wynn&#x27;s purchase included Hayes&#x27; house, which was vacated and demolished along with the Castaways to make way for a new casino resort. Wynn sold his Golden Nugget Atlantic City resort, and used the profits to fund his new project.

===Name===
Numerous names were considered for Wynn&#x27;s project, including Bombay and Bombay Club, which had been rejected by the end of 1986. &quot;Wynn&quot; was considered as a name, and would later be used for the Wynn Las Vegas resort.

Wynn unveiled plans for the tropical-themed resort, temporarily known then as the Golden Nugget, in June 1987. He said the project would be renamed at a later point to match its South Seas theme. The project&#x27;s working title came from Wynn&#x27;s Golden Nugget hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas. Wynn did not intend to have two Golden Nuggets in Las Vegas, believing they would become known as &quot;the old one&quot; and &quot;the new one&quot;, the former of which he found undesirable for the downtown property.

The final name was announced in December 1988: The Mirage. The name emphasized the resort as an oasis in the Nevada desert. To avoid confusion, Wynn purchased the rights to the Mirage name from two local businesses, the La Mirage Casino and the Mirage Motel. Both received $250,000 to change their names.

===Development===
Construction began in November 1987. General contractors included MarCor Development Company and Sierra Construction Corporation, the latter of which worked on the hotel tower. The project had an early cost of $550 million, although it went over budget. With an ultimate cost of $630 million, the Mirage was the world&#x27;s most expensive hotel-casino ever built, until the opening of Trump Taj Mahal a few months later in Atlantic City. Much of the Mirage project was financed by Drexel Burnham Lambert. Financier Michael Milken, an executive of the company, helped fund the project by selling $525 million worth of mortgage bonds. The Mirage was the first Las Vegas resort to be built with the money of Wall Street through the use of junk bonds. This financing method would later be adopted by other casino developers throughout the U.S.

Bobby Baldwin oversaw major aspects of the project with Wynn, and would later serve as the Mirage&#x27;s president, after previously serving in the same position at the Las Vegas Golden Nugget. To prepare for the opening, Baldwin and others spent nearly a year visiting 250 companies – in fields such as hospitality and dining – to gather information and advice. Dissatisfied with the current public relations firm, Wynn hired Hill &amp; Knowlton eight weeks before the opening. Despite the company&#x27;s objections, Wynn refused to allow media tours and the release of early images, wanting to keep the resort a surprise for the opening. The Mirage hired nearly 6,400 employees. Wynn emphasized customer service to the workers, who underwent a month of job training before the opening.

===Operation===
The Mirage opened at 12:00 p.m. on November 22, 1989. Wynn previously scheduled a December 26 opening, but changed these plans after securing the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Durán III boxing match at the resort for December 7. He intended for the Mirage to become a popular venue for boxing matches, competing with other Las Vegas resorts. Within hours of the opening, a casino customer hit a $4.6 million jackpot on a $1 slot machine.

The resort had non-traditional features for a Las Vegas gaming property, and Wynn considered them to be the primary attractions, saying the Mirage would not be dependent on its casino like other properties. Its signature attraction was an erupting artificial volcano, providing free entertainment to pedestrians in front of the resort. Other attractions included a dolphin habitat and a lush jungle display located beneath a domed atrium. In addition, the resort featured a magic show by Siegfried &amp; Roy, and the duo&#x27;s white tigers were on display in the resort while not performing. Financial analysts and gaming executives were skeptical of the Mirage, which needed to make an unprecedented $1 million per day to cover its expenses. The property would end up exceeding expectations, and gaming would become less of a focus for future Strip resorts.

The Mirage was the first new resort to be built on the Strip in 16 years, after the completion of the MGM Grand (now Horseshoe) in 1973. The Mirage was also the first megaresort to open on the Strip, and was the second in the Las Vegas Valley after the opening of the International Hotel in 1969. The Mirage&#x27;s success prompted a building boom for other large Strip resorts during the 1990s. Prior to the Mirage&#x27;s opening, the city was experiencing a decline in tourism, especially following New Jersey&#x27;s legalization of gambling in Atlantic City. Las Vegas tourism increased 16 percent in 1990, which remains one of the largest year-over-year increases in the city&#x27;s history as of 2024.

Due to the Mirage&#x27;s success, Wynn borrowed an additional $100 million in 1990, to add more features. These included a parking garage, more high-roller villas, and an expansion of the pool area. Wynn also partnered with singer Michael Jackson to design a mountain and water attraction at the Mirage. It would resemble Diamond Head, Hawaii, and would include pools, a water slide, and high-roller villas. It would cost up to $15 million, and would be built behind the resort. It was scheduled to open later in 1990, but ultimately went unbuilt.
Wynn owned the resort through his company, Golden Nugget Inc., which he renamed Mirage Resorts in 1991. A $55 million renovation took place in 1995. As of 1997, it was the most profitable resort on the Strip. Wynn left the property and Mirage Resorts in 2000, when the company was acquired by MGM Grand Inc., later renamed to MGM Mirage. The hotel rooms were renovated in 2002, and a major renovation took place from 2005 to 2006, to help the Mirage compete with newer resorts. The project included several new restaurants and a nightclub, among other changes. It was the largest renovation since the resort&#x27;s opening.

A $100 million renovation took place in 2008, updating the casino floor and hotel rooms, while adding several restaurants. In 2009, Phil Ruffin bought the adjacent Treasure Island Hotel and Casino from MGM Mirage. He subsequently made offers to buy the 65-acre Mirage, but was rejected. MGM Mirage was renamed MGM Resorts International in 2010. Twenty years after its opening, the Mirage remained popular despite being overshadowed by newer and more-luxurious resorts.

Ownership of the Mirage, along with many other MGM properties, was transferred in 2016 to MGM Growth Properties, while MGM Resorts continued to operate it under a lease agreement. Vici Properties would later acquire MGM Growth, including the Mirage, in 2022.

===Hard Rock rebranding===
In 2019, Hard Rock International expressed an interest in buying property on the Las Vegas Strip for a new Hard Rock resort, following the 2018 sale and proposed rebranding of the original Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. In November 2021, MGM Resorts announced that it was in the early process of selling the Mirage&#x27;s casino operations. The company already operated nine other resorts, and was in the process of adding a tenth. CEO William Hornbuckle, who helped oversee the Mirage&#x27;s opening, said the resort &quot;just fell pretty far down in the spectrum of how much in capital we&#x27;d allocate to it in any given period of time in the near future. And so we just took a strategic decision to sell it&quot;.

In December 2021, Hard Rock agreed to purchase the Mirage&#x27;s operations from MGM Resorts for $1.075 billion. Under the deal, Hard Rock would lease the property from Vici and would rebrand the Mirage as the Hard Rock Las Vegas. MGM would keep the &quot;Mirage&quot; name and license it to Hard Rock for up to three years, until the rebranding takes effect. The Mirage will receive a full renovation as part of the rebranding, with rooms being completely gutted and remodeled.

Hard Rock also intends to construct a guitar-shaped hotel tower on the property, like the Seminole Hard Rock in Florida. The new tower will replace the Mirage&#x27;s volcano, prompting a Change.org petition to save the attraction from demolition. This effort was unsuccessful, and the volcano will be demolished once construction begins on the Hard Rock transition. The guitar tower is expected to rise 660 feet. Hard Rock&#x27;s previous proposal for a 998-foot tower was rejected by the county. The redesigned tower would add 596 rooms for a new total of 3,640. Construction is expected to take two and a half years. The casino and convention facilities will also be expanded.

Hard Rock&#x27;s purchase was finalized on December 19, 2022, making it the first tribal gaming operator on the Las Vegas Strip. Under the new ownership, additional slot machines and table games were soon added in an effort to increase gaming revenue. Stages were also added to two bars for nightly entertainment, consistent with Hard Rock&#x27;s music theme.

The Mirage was expected to continue operating throughout the renovation and expansion project, with completion by early 2028. However, in May 2024, Hard Rock announced that the Mirage would permanently close two months later, in order to expedite the project. Hard Rock Las Vegas is expected to open by the end of May 2027. It will employ up to 6,000 workers.

===Closure===

The Mirage&#x27;s hotel closed on July 15, 2024. Gaming operations ended on the early morning of July 17, and the entire property was closed later that day, shortly after 11:00 a.m. The Mirage attracted many last-time visitors in the days leading up to its closure. Hard Rock International expected to provide $80 million in severance pay to the property&#x27;s 3,000 laid-off workers. At its closure, the Mirage included 137 employees who had been with the property since it opened.

Closing ceremonies included speeches by former Las Vegas mayor Jan Jones Blackhurst and by Steve Wynn&#x27;s wife, Elaine Wynn, who toured the property hours before the closure. She had not visited the property in years and said, &quot;It&#x27;s a very poignant moment for me, and I didn&#x27;t realize the impact of it until I walked into the building. But this is what we do in Las Vegas. We reinvest, we refresh, and we keep Las Vegas as one of the most exciting cities in the entire world.&quot; The ceremony concluded with a final eruption of the volcano. Steve Wynn did not attend the event, but wrote a lengthy tribute to the property, acknowledging its legacy. Bo Bernhard, director of the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), noted that the Mirage &quot;changed the image Las Vegas projected to the rest of the world&quot; and set a standard for future resorts. Michael Green, a UNLV history professor, said, &quot;Las Vegas always reinvents itself. The Mirage is no longer state-of-the-art.&quot;

Nevada gaming regulations required that the Mirage award its $1.6 million accumulated progressive jackpot before its closure, with the casino paying out about 75% as slot machine jackpots and the other 25% via table games. From July 9–11, the casino gave away $200,000 in slot machine jackpots, followed by $250,000 over the next two days. On July 16, it gave away $100,000; the remaining $400,000 was given away at the table games.

Work on the Hard Rock project began one day after the closure. Demolition of the volcano was among the first tasks. Signage from the Mirage was donated to the city&#x27;s Neon Museum for preservation, including a 30-foot-long arch along the Strip that marked the resort&#x27;s south entry.

==Legal cases==
In 1992, guest Joseph Canterino said he was beaten and robbed by two men on the hotel&#x27;s 16th floor. The men, who were never found, took more than $70,000 according to Canterino, who said the incident made him nervous to leave home. He sued the Mirage, alleging inadequate security. After a decade of litigation, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled in the resort&#x27;s favor.

In 1997, Mirage executive Laura Choi traveled to South Korea to collect gambling debts for the resort. However, she was arrested for violating the country&#x27;s law on debt collection, which prohibited citizens from allowing money to go overseas if the amount exceeded $10,000. According to the Mirage, the money was supposed to be collected in other countries through a number of legal avenues. An investigation into Choi and the Mirage was launched by multiple agencies. Choi said Mirage Resorts was aware of her actions and encouraged them, while the company called Choi a rogue employee and declined to provide legal assistance. After 79 days in prison, she returned to the U.S. and was fired. State gaming regulators alleged that Choi&#x27;s actions were supported by Mirage Resorts, which eventually paid a $350,000 fine. The company later alleged that Choi embezzled money, and that she conspired with Wynn&#x27;s casino rival, Donald Trump, to obtain guest lists and divert customers from the Mirage to Trump&#x27;s properties instead. Choi, meanwhile, filed wrongful termination lawsuits against the company. The two settled in 2001.

In 1997, the Mirage was sued by 11 cocktail waitresses alleging weight discrimination from Wynn and the resort. The suit referenced a 1995 meeting that some of the women had with Wynn, who allegedly told them, &quot;You&#x27;re too fat, and I&#x27;m embarrassed to have you working here&quot;. The incident would later become known as the &quot;Fat Meeting&quot;, and the women became the subject of weight-related jokes among co-workers. Two women agreed to $5,000 settlements in 1998, and another withdrew from the case. It ended in May 2003, after the remaining women agreed to settlements with MGM Mirage.

In 2003, several resort employees were fired after failure to file months&#x27; worth of currency transaction reports. One former employee in particular would become the primary focus of a state investigation, which found that he had lied to his supervisors about mailing the reports, concealing the fact that he was actually months behind on the work. Nearly 15,000 reports had gone unfiled, and the Nevada Gaming Commission issued a record $5 million fine against MGM Mirage. CEO Terry Lanni considered it the most embarrassing incident in the gaming industry during his 26-year career. Two other ex-employees sued the company, alleging wrongful termination in the case.

==Design and plant life==

The Mirage was designed by Joel Bergman, who led Wynn&#x27;s design firm Atlandia. The firm also included interior designers Henry Conversano and Roger Thomas, and architect DeRuyter Butler. Don Brinkerhoff and his landscape company, Lifescapes International, also worked on the resort. In addition to his team, Wynn also took design suggestions from his wife Elaine. The team was heavily involved in every design aspect of the project, which underwent numerous revisions, particularly in relation to its hotel tower. Wynn&#x27;s team did extensive studies of several local resorts – Bally&#x27;s, the Las Vegas Hilton, the Flamingo, and the adjacent Caesars Palace – and sought to combine their best features into one property.

Unlike other casinos at the time, the Mirage&#x27;s pedestrian entrances were built back away from the Las Vegas Strip, with the volcano serving as an attraction to pique the interest of pedestrians and lure them inside. This was done at the suggestion of Elaine Wynn: &quot;Steve wanted to build the Mirage right off the sidewalk, and I said that we had to push it back, that people wouldn&#x27;t get the benefit of the architectural design if they didn&#x27;t have a frame of reference&quot;. Wynn had the property layout designed for convenience to guests, allowing them to quickly access amenities.

The Mirage has a South Seas/Polynesian theme. Wynn said, &quot;There had been a terrible sameness to the properties of Las Vegas. The public couldn&#x27;t differentiate between the Sands, the Dunes, the Aladdin, the Sahara. I wanted to take it to a new level&quot;. Describing his vision, Wynn said, &quot;Think of the harsh Southern Nevada desert, and then you see a waterfall, something out of the South Pacific or the island of Kauai. It&#x27;s not supposed to be there, and that was the intention&quot;. He was partly inspired by the 1958 film &quot;South Pacific&quot;. The volcano and waterfall features were added as a contrast to the city&#x27;s usual neon lights. Wynn said, &quot;I&#x27;m burned out on neon. I think it&#x27;s cheap. To me, neon is yesterday Las Vegas&quot;.

Upon its opening, the exterior included 10 acres of landscaped lawns and pools, featuring 1,000 palm trees and 40,000 scrubs. Other plant life included pine trees and ferns. The Mirage had a staff of 60 gardeners to oversee the various plant life around the property. The resort includes a nine-story domed atrium which covers an indoor tropical rainforest display. It has a combination of fake and real plant life, including orchids and 70-foot palm trees. A 40-foot Washington palm was injected with formaldehyde to preserve it, and a steel rod was inserted up its trunk to angle it over a stream in the atrium. Brinkerhoff handled the design and landscaping for the atrium, which was inspired by a project that Wynn planned in Atlantic City, before cancelling it in 1985.

By 2019, the resort&#x27;s tropical theme had been scaled back. Five years later, the atrium would be demolished as part of the Hard Rock transition.

==Features==

With 3,049 rooms, the Mirage was among the world&#x27;s largest hotels when it opened, surpassed by the Las Vegas Hilton (3,174) and the Rossiya Hotel in Moscow (3,200). The hotel tower, standing 29 stories, was built out in a Y-shape layout, copying the design used at the Las Vegas Hilton. The Mirage popularized the Y-shape design, which was later copied by Las Vegas&#x27; Treasure Island, Monte Carlo, and Mandalay Bay resorts. The hotel&#x27;s top five floors are used for high roller rooms and penthouse suites. The exterior windows are made of 18-karat gold, and the suite floors are distinguished with uninterrupted glass panes, whereas the lower floors have white streaks between them. The white-and-gold color scheme had previously been used at the Golden Nugget.

Since its opening, the hotel has featured a $1.2 million aquarium tank, built behind the check-in stand. The aquarium was conceived by Conversano to distract guests and relax them while waiting to check in. It contains hundreds of fish, and is a popular attraction.

The Mirage&#x27;s casino measures . It opened with 2,300 slot machines and 115 table games. A high-limit area was added at the last minute, having been overlooked prior to that point. The Mirage was the first Las Vegas casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games. In 1997, Mirage Resorts spent $150 million on artwork which was displayed in the resort&#x27;s high-stakes gaming area. The casino added a new high-limit gaming area in 2004, featuring design work by artist Dale Chihuly.

The Mirage also has of convention space. Other resort features have included a tattoo parlor, and a clothing store by the Kardashian family. The Mirage-Treasure Island Tram travels between the two resorts.
The Jet nightclub was added in 2005, operated by The Light Group. The club was divided across three rooms. It featured projection imagery and 120 LED ceiling tiles. The club operated until 2011, when it was renamed 1 OAK, standing for &quot;one of a kind&quot;. The club featured artwork by Roy Nachum. It closed in early 2020.

Revolution, an $11 million nightclub themed after the Beatles, was added in 2006, to accompany the resort&#x27;s opening of the Beatles-themed show &quot;Love&quot; by Cirque du Soleil. It was a joint venture between Apple Corps and Cirque du Soleil, marking the latter&#x27;s first Las Vegas nightclub. The club fit up to 400 people. The entrance was marked by 10-foot-tall capitalized letters spelling out the club&#x27;s name, with &quot;EVOL&quot; spelled backwards to form the word &quot;LOVE&quot;. The club closed in 2015.

The resort includes a topless pool area known as Bare Pool Lounge, opened in 2007. It is also operated by The Light Group. It features DJ music, and is popular among local residents, as well as celebrities.

===Volcano===

The Mirage opened with an artificial volcano attraction, located in front of the resort. It became a signature attraction for Las Vegas. The volcano, free to the public and visible to pedestrians, erupts regularly each night. Gas jets provide the flames for the volcano, which has water flowing down its sides into a lagoon, covering . Natural gas pipes, in width, are used in conjunction with a recirculating system to give the appearance that the lagoon is on fire. In addition, whitewater from the volcano is covered in red lighting to simulate lava.

Originally, the lagoon area was to include a dormant volcano. Lighting designer David Hersey, who was hired to light the resort, suggested making the volcano erupt. Wynn had been satisfied with the lagoon feature as-is, and he was concerned that an erupting volcano would look underwhelming. However, he approved the idea after seeing a scale model. Hersey designed the attraction with Brinkerhoff. They added a texture to the rock formations to produce micro bubbles in the water, fulfilling Wynn&#x27;s desire to have whitewater in the attraction, as it allowed for adequate lighting. Wynn disliked the sulfuric odor given off by the volcanic eruptions, so a piña colada scent was added.
In 2005, the design firm WET was hired to begin planning an upgrade of the volcano. The company spent two years developing a fire-shooting device for the revamped volcano. It closed in February 2008, to allow for the $25 million upgrade to take place. The volcanic structure, made of steel, was stripped down to receive a new exterior. It reopened at the end of the year. The improved volcano shoots water high, while 120 flamethrower devices spout out flames on the lagoon. The attraction is choreographed to music by Mickey Hart and Zakir Hussain. WET&#x27;s redesign was inspired by the Fountains of Bellagio, another choreographed attraction by the company.

In 2015, MGM reduced the number of daily volcanic eruptions as a potential cost-saving measure. Super Bowl LVIII was held in Las Vegas in 2024, and was broadcast by CBS, owned by Paramount Global. To promote the game and Paramount media franchises, the Mirage&#x27;s volcano and lagoon area were temporarily transformed into an interactive Alpine-themed mountain attraction depicting the Paramount Pictures mountain logo.

===Animal habitats===

A $14 million dolphin habitat opened at the Mirage on October 19, 1990, purporting to serve as an educational and research center while also offering the public scheduled entertainment featuring dolphins and trainers. The facility consisted of four pools providing a total of 2.5 million gallons, exceeding government minimums. The attraction included tours, and for an additional fee, visitors could interact with the dolphins and become trainers for a day. School groups frequently visited the site as local schools took it to be entertaining and educational. It originally featured five bottlenose dolphins, including four from Marathon, Florida and one from Texas. As of 2008, three dolphin generations had been born at the attraction, and a fourth began in 2019. The attraction did not feature wild dolphins.

On November 13, 1996, the Mirage opened the Secret Garden of Siegfried &amp; Roy, an outdoor attraction showcasing six types of animals which were featured in the magicians&#x27; show at the resort. These included Bengal tigers, white tigers, white lions, a snow leopard, a panther, and an Asian elephant. Siegfried &amp; Roy also ran a breeding program for big cats, particularly white lions and tigers, which resided at the Secret Garden. The $15 million attraction, covering , was built next to the property&#x27;s dolphin habitat. By 2002, the dolphin area had become part of Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s attraction, now known as Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat. The attraction covered 10 acres, and received 500,000 annual visitors as of 2017.
In addition, the white tigers from Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s magic show were on display for free while not performing. A first-floor hallway near the resort&#x27;s southern entrance featured a glass wall, allowing guests to watch the tigers in an enclosure. The tiger habitat was designed in all-white by Brinkerhoff, and was built for approximately $5 million. It opened with the resort in 1989, and was closed in November 2007, replaced by the BLT Burger restaurant. The tigers were moved to Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s Secret Garden to encourage more visitors there.

Several animal-rights groups criticized the habitats. In 2009, Born Free USA and the World Society for the Protection of Animals accused the Mirage of using its dolphin habitat for entertainment and profit rather than education. Fourteen dolphins had died at the habitat since its opening, five of them stillbirths or young deaths. Others died from respiratory problems. Later in 2009, the Mirage imported two new dolphins, despite criticism from the groups. After extensive inspections, pro-industry animal welfare group American Humane certified the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat in 2017, stating that it represented &quot;the gold standard for animal welfare&quot;. It was one of 14 animal attractions worldwide to receive their endorsement, and the first in the western U.S.

MGM closed the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat in September 2022, following three more dolphin deaths that year. Hard Rock International subsequently determined that the attraction would not be part of its future plans for the resort, with the animals relocated to new homes. Three of the habitat&#x27;s dolphins were returned to SeaWorld San Diego, which had loaned them to the resort years earlier. Others were relocated to Coral World Ocean Park in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The big cats were moved to animal sanctuaries in Oregon and Texas.

===Restaurants===
The Mirage opened with five fine-dining restaurants, including the Italian-themed Ristorante Riva. It also had middle-class eateries such as the Bermuda Buffet and the 24-hour Caribe Cafe. To keep costs down, a single kitchen was built in the center of the property to service the restaurants. In 1998, the Mirage revamped its restaurants and added several new ones. Among them was Onda, an Italian restaurant by chef Todd English that replaced Ristorante Riva.

Chef Alex Stratta oversaw Renoir, a restaurant featuring paintings by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. It opened in 1999. A year later, Renoir became one of the first Las Vegas restaurants to win a Five-Star rating from the Mobil Travel Guide. It also won the AAA Five Diamond Award in 2001 and 2002. Renoir closed in November 2004, after Stratta declined to renew his contract. It was replaced by a Chinese restaurant known as Fin. A Japanese restaurant, Otoro, would also open at the property.
Several restaurant changes were made in the mid-2000s. A new buffet, designed by Adam Tihany, was added in 2004. Carnegie Deli, a popular Manhattan establishment, opened another location at the Mirage in 2005, also with a design by Tihany. Like its predecessor, the Mirage location was also popular. It eventually closed in 2020, to make way for a new eatery.

B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club opened a location at the Mirage in November 2009, replacing the Caribe Cafe. The club operated through a lease agreement with the Mirage, although the two had a strained relationship. In particular, the club accused the resort of overcharging for cleaning services such as dishwashing. The Blues Club filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2011, and fought in court to avoid being evicted. It eventually closed in November 2012.

Chef Tom Colicchio opened a 220-seat steakhouse, Tom Colicchio&#x27;s Heritage Steak, in 2013. Meanwhile, chef Michael LaPlaca took over Onda and renamed it Portofino the following year. It also served Italian food, and briefly offered a $100 lasagna topped with 23-karat gold flakes and shaved white diamond truffles. The restaurant closed in 2017, and LaPlaca opened a larger Italian restaurant, Osteria Costa, elsewhere in the resort.

BLT Burger operated for eight years before being replaced in 2016 by a resort-run restaurant, LVB Burgers &amp; Bar. An sports bar – known as The Still Crafts, Drafts &amp; Eats – was also opened in 2016.

==Live entertainment==
The Mirage showcased boxing matches in its early years, competing against the Las Vegas Hilton and the adjacent Caesars Palace. Matches at the resort included:
* Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Durán III (1989)
* Buster Douglas vs. Evander Holyfield (1990)
* Mike Tyson vs. Donovan Ruddock (1991)
* Mike Tyson vs. Donovan Ruddock II (1991)
* Félix Trinidad vs. Freddie Pendleton (1996)

Cirque du Soleil performed its first Las Vegas show at the Mirage starting in 1992. The show, &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot;, was performed in a 1,300-seat big-top tent, built behind the resort. The temporary $5 million tent was air-conditioned, fire-proof, and had a cement foundation to withstand strong winds. Wynn and Cirque du Soleil would partner again for &quot;Mystère&quot;, which opened at Wynn&#x27;s Treasure Island resort in 1993.

Two additional theater venues were being added in 1999, at a cost of $100 million. One theater was to be used for the show &quot;Miss Spectacular&quot;, which ultimately went unproduced. Another stage was built for impressionist Danny Gans, who began entertaining at the Mirage in 2000. A ballroom was converted into the 1,265-seat Danny Gans Theatre, at a cost of approximately $15 million. Gans&#x27; contract ended in early 2009, when he moved to Wynn&#x27;s new Encore Las Vegas property. Ventriloquist Terry Fator replaced Gans and took over his former theater space, operating a popular puppet show for more than 10 years. Amid declining ticket sales, Fator closed his show in 2020 and sought a smaller venue.

Other entertainers at the Mirage have included Paul Anka, Dennis Miller, Lewis Black, George Lopez, Bill Burr, and Matt Goss. Several individuals have performed one-man shows at the resort, including Larry King (2011), Terry Bradshaw (2013), and Al Pacino (2014). Magician Shin Lim has performed at the Mirage since 2019. A comedy club, known as Aces of Comedy, debuted in 2010, and was rebranded Center Stage Comedy in 2023.

===Siegfried &amp; Roy===

Illusionists Siegfried &amp; Roy signed a $58 million contract with the Mirage, and began performing there on February 1, 1990. Their magic show included several white tigers, and it took place in a 1,500-seat theater, known as Theatre Mirage. The show was produced by Feld Entertainment. The duo would become a top attraction for Las Vegas and the Mirage, which added a statue of them on the property grounds in 1993. Two years later, because of their success, Theatre Mirage was renamed after Siegfried &amp; Roy.

On October 3, 2003, Roy Horn was injured during a performance when one of the tigers, Mantacore, bit him by the neck and dragged him offstage. Horn reportedly suffered a stroke during surgery for his injury. Horn later said that he suffered a dizzy spell during the show, thinking it may have been the start of the stroke, and stated that Mantacore was attempting to save him: &quot;I fell over. Mantacore saw that I was falling down. So he actually took me and brought me to the other exit where everybody could get me and help me&quot;. MGM Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman said, &quot;If that animal intended to harm Roy, it would have lasted two seconds, and there would have been no need for a hospital&quot;.

Horn was left partially paralyzed from the stroke. Several days after the attack, the Mirage announced that the show would not resume. The duo had given 5,750 performances at the Mirage, and the closure affected 267 workers. For six months, the resort&#x27;s roadside sign on the Las Vegas Strip continued to advertise Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s show as a tribute. Mantacore became a permanent resident in the resort&#x27;s Secret Garden attraction, after Horn insisted that the animal be spared.

The entry road leading onto the property was named Siegfried and Roy Drive in 2020, honoring the duo and their impact on the resort&#x27;s success. In 2024, their statue was donated to the city&#x27;s Neon Museum for preservation.

===&quot;Love&quot;===
Overall, resort profits were hurt following the cancellation of Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s show. In August 2004, their former theater was gutted to make way for a $100 million venue, which would accommodate a Cirque du Soleil show based on the Beatles, in partnership with Apple Corps. The show had been in development for years. The revamped theater includes 2,000 seats, the largest of any Cirque du Soleil stage in Las Vegas. It has 6,000 speakers.

The show, titled &quot;Love&quot;, opened in June 2006 and featured music by the Beatles. Giant banners advertising the show were added onto the hotel tower. The show was successful, receiving eight million visitors in its first 10 years. It closed on July 7, 2024, as part of the Hard Rock transition.
==In popular culture==
Cher&#x27;s 1991 CBS special &quot;Cher Extravaganza: Live at the Mirage&quot; was taped during stops of the singer&#x27;s 1990 Heart of Stone Tour. The Mirage&#x27;s theater was used for a scene in the 1992 film &quot;Pure Country&quot;. The Mirage is prominently featured at the end of &quot;City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly&#x27;s Gold&quot;. The resort is also featured in the 1996 film &quot;Sgt. Bilko&quot;. Wynn allowed portions of the Mirage to be closed for production of the 1997 film &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot;, which features the resort prominently, including its pool area, and its Siegfried &amp; Roy show.

In 2000, filming took place there for the season-five finale of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. The Mirage is also one of three Las Vegas casinos robbed in the 2001 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, and is featured in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, under the name &quot;The Visage&quot;. In 2009, the &quot;Love&quot; theater was featured in the finale episode of &quot;The Amazing Race 15&quot;. Various areas of the resort, including its roadside sign, were also featured in the finale episode of &quot;The Amazing Race 24&quot;, aired in 2014.

The musical group The Killers named their 2020 album, &quot;Imploding the Mirage&quot;, after the resort.

<doc id="1033462" wikidata="Q2294528" url="?curid=1033462" title="Niobe (The Matrix)">
<text>Niobe is a fictional character in &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise. She is portrayed by Jada Pinkett Smith. She serves as a supporting character in the three sequels of the original film, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, and one of the protagonists of the video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;. Niobe also appears in the MMORPG &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;. In the game, however, Niobe&#x27;s character voicing is portrayed by Gina Torres, who portrayed the minor Zion character Cas in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;.

==Background==
Niobe is a human from Zion, being one of the rebels participating in the war against the Machines and the Matrix. She is the captain and pilot of a Zion hovercraft, the &quot;Logos&quot;, the smallest (and therefore most maneuverable) ship in the human fleet with a crew of only three: herself, weapons expert and First Mate Ghost, and Operator Sparks.

Within the virtual world of the Matrix, Niobe is one of Zion&#x27;s most gifted martial artists. She has killed at least one Agent, survived multiple encounters with the Merovingian&#x27;s superhuman thugs, faced Seraph in one-on-one combat, and even managed to survive and escape from a confrontation with the replicating entity Smith. She is also a skilled driver as seen in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, when she swiftly navigates a crowded network of freeways in order to save Morpheus from falling to his death off the top of a truck trailer.

In the real world, she is the most skilled pilot among the rebel forces. She demonstrates this on several occasions. In one scene during &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, she maneuvered the rather massive hovercraft &quot;Hammer&quot; through the narrow, cluttered passage of a mechanical line (while under heavy attack and pursuit by Sentinels), a feat no other pilot has successfully performed. She also performs a 270-degree flip with the hovercraft, as an evasive maneuver, which apparently no previous pilot had even attempted before. She also gave up her ship to Neo so he could go and stop the machines. When questioned about this since she did not believe in the prophecy, she responded that she &quot;did&quot; believe in Neo.

Sixty years later, an elderly Niobe is the general of the human forces and the leader of the human-Machine city Io. She is also revealed to have been the one to free Neo&#x27;s new ally Bugs from the Matrix. However, she is now more focused on rebuilding and keeping her people safe, lacking much of the previous fire that she had possessed. Niobe reveals to Neo that after the war, it took her a long time to accept that they were truly safe. When Neo reminds Niobe of how she once gave up her ship to him, she simply responds that times are different now and she has him locked up until they can come to an agreement. Bugs accuses Niobe of having given up on people and to care more about rebuilding than freeing those trapped in the Matrix. However, her partner Freya points out to Niobe that she is conflicted by her actions which Niobe admits are motivated by fear. After speaking with Sati, Niobe, having regained some of her old fire, gathers her captains for a mission to rescue Trinity and they all instantly volunteer without even hearing the full explanation from Niobe, simply trusting in her judgment and leadership.

==Relationships==
Niobe was once romantically involved with Morpheus, but their relationship broke apart after Morpheus received his revelations from the Oracle and started to preach the prophecy of the One (a prophecy Niobe has never truly believed in). After breaking up with Morpheus, Niobe eventually becomes involved with Commander Jason Locke, a taciturn, practical man who is in many ways the exact opposite of Morpheus. Both Persephone and The Oracle insinuate that Niobe is still in love with Morpheus when they confront her in &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;.

At the end of &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, as the retreating Machine army obliged the new peace bartered by Neo, Niobe is seen embracing Morpheus, perhaps an indication of a renewal of their romance. (One reference in the Special Features also intimates that they have gotten back together.) In &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, Niobe does not reveal whether or not she and the now-deceased Morpheus ever resumed their romance, but she does speak fondly about him to Neo. Although not explicitly stated in Matrix Resurrections it is implied that Niobe is now in a domestic partnership with Io’s plant expert, Freya.

==Recognition==
In January 2004, Pinkett Smith was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for the role of Niobe. Fellow cast member Nona Gaye also received a nod for her portrayal of Zee.

==Online==
In Chapter 5.1 of The Matrix Online, Niobe had a meeting with fellow Zion operatives inside Bishop Imports in the International District to test out a set of chemicals that were upgrades meant for the Agent programs. After consuming the chemicals, Anome, her trusted subordinate, shoots Niobe and all Zion operatives in the meeting while an operator of his hovercraft pulls the plug on one of his surviving crewmembers who isn&#x27;t in on his plot. Niobe&#x27;s floor is sealed and there is no way to access her floor with both the elevator and staircase systems. During the recent set of critical missions, Ghost and redpill operatives from all parties are currently attempting to save her.

In Chapter 5.2 of The Matrix Online, Niobe was rescued chronologically after the fourth Zion critical mission. On the Recursion instance, Ghost leads a rescue team to Bishop Imports in Ueno, while the Effectuator (a program hired by the Merovingian who controls his constructs), and other redpills protect the hardline systems to facilitate the operation.

Other minor roles include briefing and de-briefing Zion operatives during missions, and rewarding Redpills with special items.

<text>The Association of Norwegian Students Abroad (ANSA, in Norwegian: &quot;Samskipnaden for norske studenter i utlandet&quot;) is a non-profit and membership based organisation aiming to voice the educational, cultural, political and economic interests of Norwegian students studying outside Norway and to promote overseas students as a valuable resource to domestic employers.

As of 2009/2010, 20,165 Norwegian students were studying abroad. In 2014 ANSA had over 10,000 members at over 1,200 educational institutions in more than 90 countries.
ANSA in particular works to influence rules and regulations governing student grants and loans, arguing that all students should have the right to study any subject in any country as they wish. The Norwegian government has been funding higher education for Norwegian students abroad for more than 60 years, with the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (&quot;Lånekassen&quot;) providing students with loans and grants. ANSA was founded by Norwegian students in 1956 to address difficulties students encountered in dealing with Lånekassen.

The organisation targets services at students prior to, during, and after studies abroad. A range of membership benefits are central in attracting students as members. ANSA&#x27;s Information Centre for higher education abroad is funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research to provide unbiased advice on higher education abroad. The Membership Department deals with enquiries from potential and current members, while ANSA&#x27;s Student Adviser provides advice to students encountering problems during their studies abroad, such as with regards to their university, their insurance, or Lånekassen.

==Headquarters and Governance Structures==
ANSA is staffed by 12 full-time employees. The Secretary-General heads the office in Oslo.

The President of ANSA is elected at the annual general assembly. The President&#x27;s main responsibility is lobbying for ANSA’s political priorities towards the Norwegian authorities. The President is also chair of ANSA’s Board and main spokesperson of ANSA.

The board of ANSA consists of six students abroad, two students who previously have studied abroad, ANSA’s president and a representative for the employees at ANSA. The Board is responsible for ANSA’s political priorities and the main goals of the organisation.

Among ANSA&#x27;s members are over 500 volunteers who organise various social and cultural events and represent ANSA at their places of study.

<text>The manga series &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; features a large cast of fictional characters created by Nobuhiro Watsuki. Set in Japan during the Meiji period, several of the characters are real historical figures who interact with the fictional characters.

The story begins in 1878 and follows a pacifist wanderer named Himura Kenshin, who was previously an assassin known as &quot;Hitokiri Battōsai&quot; working for the Ishin Shishi during the Bakumatsu period. After helping Kamiya Kaoru, the instructor of a kendo school in Tokyo, in defeating a criminal, he is invited by her to stay at her dojo. During his stay in Tokyo, Kenshin befriends new people including Myōjin Yahiko, a young child descendant from a samurai family who starts training under Kaoru, Sagara Sanosuke, a former Sekihō Army cadet who enjoys fighting, and Takani Megumi, a doctor involved with the illegal drug trade. He also encounters old and new enemies whose ambitions cause Kenshin to return to fighting, this time to protect the innocent.
==Protagonists==

===Himura Kenshin===

 is a former legendary assassin known as (rendered as &quot;Battousai the Manslayer&quot; in the Media Blasters English anime dub, as &quot;Battousai: The Slasher&quot; in the Sony English dub.) At the end of the Bakumatsu, he becomes a wandering samurai, now wielding a &quot;sakabatō&quot;, a katana that has a structure in which the blade and ridge are struck in the opposite direction to a regular katana, so if it is used normally, it will always be in a ridged state and will have much less killing power. Kenshin wanders the country offering protection and aid to those in need as atonement for the killings he once committed as an assassin. He meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru in Tokyo, who invites him to live in her dojo despite learning about Kenshin&#x27;s past. Throughout the series, Kenshin begins to establish relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, while dealing with his fair share of foes, new and old.

===Kamiya Kaoru===

 is the instructor of a kendo school in Tokyo called &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot;. All of its students leave when many people are killed by someone claiming to be &quot;Hitokiri Battōsai&quot; and a practitioner of &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot;, damaging her school&#x27;s reputation. The real Battōsai, now wandering pacifist Himura Kenshin, saves Kaoru from this murderous impostor. Kaoru invites Kenshin to stay at her dojo as she notes that he is a gentle person instead of a &quot;hitokiri&quot;. As the series continues, Kaoru develops strong romantic feelings for Kenshin, who is constantly haunted by his past deeds and believes he does not deserve happiness.

===Myōjin Yahiko===

 is an orphan from a samurai family who was forced to work as a pickpocket to repay the debt he had presumably owed, as his parents died before they could repay it. When Himura Kenshin rescues him, he decides to grow up to be just like Kenshin. But because of his strong beliefs, Kenshin will not teach the sword style he had learned. Therefore, Kenshin arranges for Yahiko to be trained in &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot; by Kamiya Kaoru. As the series progresses, Yahiko becomes skilled at swordsmanship and faces many opponents.

===Sagara Sanosuke===

 is a former member of the Sekihō Army. When the group was destroyed by the Meiji government, he became a fighter-for-hire to calm his anger by fighting. During his introduction in the series, he encounters the wanderer Himura Kenshin, who easily defeats him and can convince him to stop his mercenary work and instead start protecting people. Sanosuke becomes Kenshin&#x27;s best friend and his partner in most of their fights.

===Takani Megumi===

 comes from a famous family of physicians from the Aizu region. She became the assistant to a Tokyo physician who had created a deadly new form of opium. When the doctor was killed, she was forced to make the new opium for corrupt industrialist Takeda Kanryū for the past three years. After being freed and stopped from committing suicide by Kenshin and Sanosuke, she becomes a doctor to atone for her past misdeeds. She has a wicked sense of humor and enjoys flirting with Kenshin to make Kaoru jealous (both Kaoru and Sanosuke refer to her as a &quot;vixen&quot; and in the manga vixen ears appear whenever she indulges in her sense of humor), but helps Kaoru come to terms with her feelings towards Kenshin. She is loyal to her friends and is always there to heal their wounds, especially Sanosuke, whom she often cautions about fighting. At the end of the series, she leaves Tokyo to open a clinic in Aizu.

Nobuhiro Watsuki created Megumi as a &quot;mature woman&quot; but had no specific model in mind. In the first &quot;Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot; one-shot, Megumi, Kaoru, and Yahiko were siblings. Despite this version and her final version in the main series being so different, Watsuki said they have the same spirit and are not so unalike. Although he admitted the one-shot&#x27;s version of Megumi had a &quot;lighter quality&quot; because of her small role, he, therefore, gave her a more &quot;earthy quality&quot; in the main serial so she could make an impression. By the time of the publication of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; volume four, Watsuki felt disappointed as she did not turn out nearly the way he wanted. However, because she is entertaining to draw and is the only woman Kaoru can interact with, he planned to have Megumi frequently appear as a secondary character. Watsuki&#x27;s used the young grandmother from Takeshi Obata&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as the design model for Megumi. Her story arc has &quot;redemption for her crimes&quot; as its theme, and the author wanted to express Kenshin&#x27;s determination through Megumi. Megumi came in fourteenth place in the series&#x27; second character popularity poll, and fifteenth in the third. She is portrayed by Yū Aoi in the live-action films.

===Shinomori Aoshi===

 is the &quot;Okashira&quot; or leader of the Oniwabanshū, and a skilled swordsman who his comrades highly respect. After he is defeated by Himura Kenshin and his comrades are killed, he becomes obsessed with killing Kenshin to earn the title of &quot;the strongest&quot; for the pride of the Oniwabanshū. He raised Makimachi Misao, the granddaughter of the previous Okashira, under his protection as a member of the Oniwabanshū.

===Saitō Hajime===

, based on the historical figure of the same name, was the leader of the third squad of the Shinsengumi during the Bakumatsu. He has a long-standing rivalry with Kenshin and firmly believes in &quot;Swift Death to Evil.&quot; He goes by the name of and works as a Meiji police officer.

===Makimachi Misao===

 is a young &quot;kunoichi&quot; from Kyoto who was raised by the Oniwabanshū. She traveled to Tokyo searching for Shinomori Aoshi whom she is in love with. She wishes to learn what happened to Aoshi and his comrades and follows Kenshin to Kyoto, hoping to meet him again. When she learns of how Aoshi has become evil and obsessed with revenge, she decides to take over his title as &quot;Okashira&quot; and tries to forget him, but she can not. Kenshin promises that he will bring Aoshi back to her again.

===Hasegawa Ashitarō===
 is an orphaned 16-year-old boy just released from prison during the &quot;Hokkaido Arc&quot; prologue. He and Inoue were inspired by buddy films with Watsuki remembering the ideal designs needed for the protagonists to be likable citing &quot;Ushio &amp; Tora&quot; as an example. The first chapter had little hints about Ashitaro being related to &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; with the second one expanding it more. Since the young character Myojin Yahiko already matured in the original &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, Watsuki created Ashitaro in order to have him act more like him during early years. Born in Niigata Prefecture, he survived by stealing crops and foraging the mountains. Although claiming to have served five years in a Tokyo prison for dine and dash, it is suspected to have been for being a gofer member of Shishio Makoto&#x27;s faction, which planned to take over Japan before disbanding when their leader died five years ago. He possesses Shishio&#x27;s sword, &quot;Mugenjin&quot;, but due to his propensity for entering uncontrolled fits of rage, Kenshin asks him not to draw it. Ashitaro&#x27;s given name was formerly written as (&quot;evil child&quot;), before he changed it to (&quot;tomorrow&#x27;s child&quot;).

===Inoue Aran===
 is a 16-year-old boy who grew up in the Westernized portion of Japan. He was jailed in Tokyo for three months for attempting to be a stowaway on a ship to the Americas. He is revealed to be half-Japanese with blond hair and suspected to be the son of a prostitute to foreigners. While travelling with Kenshin&#x27;s group to Hakodate, he forms a friendly relationship with Takeda Kanryū based on their similar interests with business. Like Ashitarō, Aran was inspired by &quot;Ushio &amp; Tora&quot; to be an appealing duo.

===Kubota Asahi===
 is a war orphan raised by the Yaminobu but claims to be a pacifist. Following their failure to kill Kenshin during the Bakumatsu, the Yaminobu lost status and were reduced to working as mercenaries for hire. Kubota was hired to Shishio&#x27;s faction and later trailed Ashitaro to retrieve Shishio&#x27;s sword. Despite her fear of Kenshin after learning that he killed his Yukishiro Tomoe in during the Bakumatsu, she is surprised to find well-meaning the former &quot;hitokiri&quot; has become and decides to assist him in his journey to Hakodate and find Kaoru&#x27;s father.

==Antagonists==

===Hiruma Brothers===
: (Gohei)
: (Kihei)
The are crooks who scheme to take ownership of Kaoru&#x27;s dojo. After Kaoru&#x27;s father died, the elder brother collapsed in front of the dojo, and Kaoru took him in, becoming a kind of a live-in apprentice and gaining Kaoru&#x27;s trust while trying to persuade her to sell the dojo. , the younger brother, is a former samurai who falsely uses the &quot;Hitokiri Battōsai&quot; and &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot; names to commit murders. The brothers use the , a former dojo in a neighboring town that has become a gathering spot for gamblers and rogues, as their base of operations. When Kaoru begins to discover the truth, the brothers attempt to kill her, but Kenshin easily defeats them after revealing himself to be the real &quot;Hitokiri Battōsai&quot;. Having escaped jail, the Hiruma Brothers appear again, hiring Sanosuke to fight Kenshin and planning to use a gun to kill a weakened Kenshin. When Kenshin defeats Sanosuke, he stops Kihei&#x27;s bullet dead on the guard of his sword. When the brothers try to attack Kaoru and Yahiko, Sanosuke defeats Gohei and Kenshin injures Kihei into submission. Later in the series, they are employed as bodyguards by Fudōsawa, a yakuza in Sanosuke&#x27;s hometown, and then by Tani Jūsanrō. Sanosuke easily beats them up on both occasions.

Gohei is the only brother to appear in the first anime series and is more intelligent than his manga counterpart. He is a former student at the Kamiya dojo. Still, when Gohei insisted on using swords for killing and then unsuccessfully attacked the master of the dojo, Kaoru&#x27;s father, he received a broken thumb and an expulsion. Gohei tries to take over the Kamiya dojo in the story, but Kenshin prevents him from doing so. Gohei hires Sanosuke to defeat Kenshin, but this fails. Later, he hires the Kisaki brothers to defeat Kenshin. Though they almost succeed, the brothers are beaten and Yahiko sends Gohei limping away after kicking him in the genitals.

Watsuki described the creation of the brothers as a &quot;direct function of the story.&quot; Watsuki wanted &quot;interesting villains to start things off with a bang&quot; and made one &quot;brainy&quot; and the other &quot;wild.&quot; He decided that the story involving the two coming together was taking &quot;too many&quot; pages, so he made the duo as brothers instead of being &quot;circumstantially related.&quot; He used a manager and director from Takeshi Obata&#x27;s &quot;&quot; sumo manga as a model for Kihei and a character he found in a magazine that made him think &quot;Ooh, &quot;impact&quot;!&quot; for Gohei. Watsuki stated that, unlike the faces of Kenshin and other characters, the faces of Kihei and Gohei are of basic shapes and therefore the two were easy to draw as a result. He said that he became fonder of the brothers as his deadlines approached.

===Udō Jin-e===

, also known as , is a deranged serial killer who has been hunting down former Ishin Shishi warriors that now hold positions in the government or economy for the past ten years. A master of the style, Jin-e was a member of the Shinsengumi during the Bakumatsu. But when he was about to be disciplined for killing people he was not supposed to, he escaped and switched sides to the Ishin Shishi and became a &quot;hitokiri&quot; for hire in Kyoto. He now appears as a man dressed in a long kimono with a long scarf and straw hat. He has a unique technique to project chi toward people, hypnotizing them with his eyes via the . When Kenshin stops him from killing Tani Jūsanrō, Jin-e makes Kenshin his next target. Believing the new repenting Kenshin to be soft and weak, Jin-e kidnaps Kaoru Kamiya to enrage Kenshin into his old &quot;Hitokiri Battōsai&quot; self. Though he assumes his old mindset and crushes Jin-e&#x27;s right elbow, ending his life as a swordsman, Kenshin stops himself from killing when Kaoru calls out. Though spared, Jin-e stabs himself in the heart, so the police will not discover who his government employer is.

Watsuki intended for the motif of Jin-e to be Okada Izō, the top &quot;hitokiri&quot; of the Bakumatsu, but admitted that his design looks even less like his counterpart than Kenshin&#x27;s looks like his. He was designed to be a &quot;murderous ogre&quot;, the &quot;polar opposite of Kenshin.&quot; The author described Jin-e as a &quot;complicated fellow&quot; who is &quot;&quot;crazy&quot;-crazy&quot; and not merely &quot;crazy-acting.&quot; Although both the character and story were difficult, Watsuki said it was worth it as Jin-e was the fan-favorite bad guy. He summarized Jin-e as, in a sense, the only character to defeat Kenshin even though he did not defeat &quot;Battōsai&quot;. Jin-e&#x27;s outfit originates from Serizawa Kamo, the main character from a Shinsengumi manga released around 14–15 years before the release of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; volume two in Japan. Jin-e&#x27;s laugh, the &quot;uhu-hu-hu,&quot; is from the character Ukon played by Ryōtarō Sugi in the television series &quot;Kenka-ya Ukon&quot;. The third volume of the drama CDs adapted the Jin-e story. Watsuki stated that for Jin-e, he wanted a voice actor with a &quot;mature and cool voice&quot; and not one with a &quot;high voice.&quot; The character is voiced by Unshō Ishizuka in the drama. Jin-e came in tenth place in the series&#x27; first character popularity poll, and tied with Arai Iori for eighteenth in the second. He also ranked seventh in the &quot;Who is Kenshin&#x27;s Biggest Rival?&quot; poll.

In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot;, Jin-e is one of the assassins hired by Takeda Kanryū to kill Kenshin. His kidnapping of Kaoru and fight with Kenshin are similar with some differences. He has holes in both hands from when Kenshin pierced them during the Bakumatsu, where he now inserts hilt-less swords to fight. Watsuki said that many of the changes he made to Jin-e in &quot;Restoration&quot; did not work out, proving that the original version is perfect. Giving Jin-e a motive to attack Kenshin, lost some of his madness; leaving out the &quot;Shin no Ippō&quot; for being &quot;too supernatural&quot;, diminished the excitement unique to shōnen manga; and the change in his skin tone to make him odder, made keeping the tone of the entire story consistent difficult. In the first live-action film, Jin-e is the principal antagonist who uses the &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot; style for horrific acts. Having acquired Kenshin&#x27;s old katana after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi, Jin-e found employment under the corrupt, power-hungry businessman, Takeda Kanryū. While sent to assassinate Takani Megumi, Jin-e crosses paths with Kenshin and recognizes him. As Kenshin and Sanosuke deal with Kanryū, Jin-e captures Kaoru and paralyzes her lungs to force Kenshin into a duel that ultimately leads to his suicide. He is portrayed by Kōji Kikkawa.

===Takeda Kanryū===

 is a cunning money-minded industrialist with a private army of about 60 men plus the Oniwabanshū led by Shinomori Aoshi. Takeda is the head of an opium dealing business where he forces Takani Megumi to create a stronger and fast-working recipe called &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; in a scheme to gain a foothold in the arms industry by purchasing modern Western weapons. Managing to recapture Megumi, Kanryū finds himself over his head when Kenshin arrives at his manor and defeats Aoshi. He resorts to using a Gatling gun shooting at everyone, killing the members of the Oniwabanshū. After his weapon runs out of bullets, Kanryū is beaten and taken into police custody.

Watsuki modeled Takeda Kanryū after Takeda Kanryūsai, the Shinsengumi&#x27;s Fifth Unit captain. He said that there was no actual model in terms of design. He described Takeda Kanryū as a &quot;carryover&quot; of Nishiwaki, a character in the first &quot;Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot; one-shot. Kanryū wears white since Watsuki felt that &quot;between Kenshin and Aoshi, there was too much black already.&quot; Watsuki felt that since he emphasized Megumi and the Oniwabanshū, Kanryū never became the character he intended, which &quot;was a bit of a letdown.&quot; The historical Takeda Kanryūsai is well known for being homosexual. Watsuki considered making Kanryū homosexual, but dropped the idea as he felt it would &quot;unnecessarily complicate things.&quot; He is portrayed by Teruyuki Kagawa in the first live-action film. For &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot;, Watsuki did not plan on making any drastic changes to Kanryū but was inspired to after seeing Kagawa&#x27;s &quot;fanatical&quot; performance in the film.

===Isurugi Raijūta===

 is a swordsman dissatisfied with the current state of swordsmanship who travels around Japan shutting down modern shinai dojos by force. He plans to revive the old style of swordsmanship (&quot;satsujin-ken&quot;, &quot;swords that bring death&quot;) with the , a league composed only of the strongest swordsman in order to create a pure kenjutsu stronger than any martial art or European firepower. He is accompanied by his &quot;apprentice&quot; Tsukayama Yutarō, whose rich family funds his campaign. His signature technique is the vacuum-wave &quot;Izuna&quot;. Kenshin realizes that despite all his talk of the killing sword, Raijūta has never actually killed anyone himself and is a fraud. Kenshin defeats him, but Raijūta picks up Yahiko and threatens to kill him. When Raijūta is confronted with the choice of actually killing someone, Kenshin explains what &quot;satsujin-ken&quot; truly entails; the weight of the lives you have taken &quot;dragging you to hell.&quot; Raijūta&#x27;s confidence breaks down and he can no longer wield a sword again. In the first anime, Raijūta is depicted as an actual murderer, ruthlessly killing the thugs he hired to con his way into Yutarō&#x27;s fortune.

Watsuki intended for Raijūta to be the opposite of Kenshin, &quot;intelligently macho and a believer of &quot;satsujin-ken&quot;.&quot; But somehow, he became &quot;a total fake&quot; who became &quot;a smaller and smaller man&quot; as the story progressed, until he was &quot;defeated by a single blow—ending almost as a villain.&quot; The author concluded that designing and developing Raijūta taught him &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and he wanted to give Raijūta &quot;peace&quot; in future stories, but added &quot;then again...this guy—! Sigh.&quot; Raijūta&#x27;s appearance was originally based on an American superhero comic book character, but as the story progressed, his appearance and personality &quot;deteriorated.&quot; Because he had difficulty with &quot;the complicated details&quot; in the Oniwabanshū story arc, Watsuki gave Raijūta a relatively simple outfit with only one design flourish, the black feathers, which turned out to be difficult to draw. Watsuki concluded that the development of Raijūta taught him a lot about character design.

===Akamatsu Arundo===
 is a mercenary of Shibumi, a corrupt politician. Because Arundo is jealous that Shibumi orders Saitō Hajime to kill Kenshin, Saitō allows Arundo to have the job, knowing he stands no chance. Arundo ambushes Kenshin and tries to use a chain to immobilize Kenshin but is ultimately defeated. Arundo discovers that Saitō is allied with Ōkubo Toshimichi. When Arundo, fearing for his safety, decides to cut ties with Shibumi and flee to Shanghai, Saitō appears and decapitates Arundo with a strike from his sword.

Watsuki stated, &quot;this character&#x27;s only there to get beat up.&quot; Appearing to aid story development, Arundo does not have much personality aside from arrogance (Watsuki&#x27;s favorite personality trait for villains). Watsuki believes that he could not make Arundo&#x27;s chain-scythe appear like real chains. The character&#x27;s design originates from a superhuman soldier in an American comic book who has a name similar to Arundo&#x27;s, that being &quot;X-Men&quot;″s Omega Red (&quot;aka&quot; meaning &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;matsu&quot; corresponding to &quot;end&quot;, equivalent to &quot;Omega&quot;, which is the last letter of the Greek alphabet - also related to the Christian concept of Alpha and Omega). Arundo&#x27;s use of chains also parallels Omega Red&#x27;s carbonadium tentacles.

===Senkaku===
 is a minion of Shishio Makoto who oppresses Shingetsu village, which after two years has been abandoned by the government. Senkaku killed Mishima Eiji&#x27;s brother and parents after learning that the boys were plotting to escape the village. He claims to have killed 99 people. Senkaku fights with a pair of knuckle blades and has high speed, contrary to his size. However, this proves to be his undoing, as Kenshin defeats Senkaku in a battle by using the gigantic size to stress out Senkaku&#x27;s limits, causing his leg to break. The police take Senkaku away, in which Saitō notes he would most likely be executed. In the anime, he manages to escape and is killed by Seta Sōjirō.

Originally, Senkaku was one of the Juppongatana, so Watsuki put a lot of effort into his creation. But since Shishio and Sōjirō were present and Kenshin needed to go to Kyoto, he decided to make Senkaku a &quot;violent village despot.&quot; Originally the author had Senkaku as an experimental character who could not form any words. Still, an editor commented that Senkaku &quot;is not a wild animal&quot; during a meeting, so Watsuki scrapped this idea. Senkaku had no model for his personality, and after the scrapping of the inarticulation trait he became &quot;pretty much just muscle-head small fry.&quot; Senkaku&#x27;s design originates from the design of the four Abukuma priests, a group of minor antagonists. Watsuki had no attachment towards the four bald priests, but felt that the cone-shaped head design was &quot;a waste for an unimportant character.&quot; So he instead used that design for Senkaku, who Watsuki said turned out to be unimportant also. In retrospect Watsuki felt that the Coneheads may have influenced him in a Sega Saturn commercial, and the Giant Soldier in &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. The author felt regret about Senkaku; what he regretted most was how he could not use Senkaku&#x27;s special technique &quot;Piercing Head-Butt&quot; in the storyline.

===Shishio Makoto===

 is the leader of the Juppongatana and the primary antagonist of the Kyoto arc. Shishio was Kenshin&#x27;s successor as &quot;hitokiri&quot; for the Ishin Shishi. When the new Meiji government discovered Shishio&#x27;s insatiable lust for power, they attempted to kill him and lit his body on fire. But he survived and has gathered an army to exact his revenge and overthrow the government.

===Komagata Yumi===

, also known as , is Shishio&#x27;s lover. She was the most famous &quot;oiran&quot; in Yoshiwara and took pride in it, until the &quot;María Luz&quot; Incident. She became reviled at the Japanese government&#x27;s refusal to compensate the newly emancipated prostitutes due to it regarding them as equivalent to livestock. She serves as Kenshin, Saitō and Sanosuke&#x27;s guide through Shishio&#x27;s maze-like hideout, taking them from each duel to avoid traps. She is often concerned about Shishio and his medical state. When Shishio&#x27;s body becomes overheated in his fight with Kenshin, she runs in between them and pleads with Kenshin to end the duel. Still, Shishio runs her through with his sword, mortally wounding her and injuring the unguarded Kenshin. Knowing that she has finally been of use to Shishio in his most important battle, she dies happy and released from her former frustration for not being able to fight next to him. She is then seen with Shishio and Hōji in hell.

Yumi was initially designed to be an attractive accessory for Shishio, as Watsuki believed a villain ought to have a &quot;temptress&quot; or two nearby. He was surprised to see her develop into such a love-driven character. In commenting on her death, the author stated that he saw Yumi&#x27;s happiness following Shishio everywhere, including hell. Watsuki had no particular personality model for Yumi. Still, the character is essentially a version of Ogin, a character played by actress Kaoru Yumi in &quot;Mitokōmon Gaiden: Kagerō Ninpō-Chō&quot;, a spinoff series of &quot;Mitokōmon&quot;. Having designed Yumi on the spot with the intention of her being sexy, Watsuki had no specific design model. But halfway through, Watsuki became a fan of Morrigan Aensland from &quot;Vampire Hunter&quot; and, as a result, began to expose more and more of Yumi&#x27;s cleavage and shoulders, &quot;eventually increasing the sexiness by about 120%.&quot; Admitting that he has always had trouble drawing women, Watsuki stated that drawing Yumi taught him that he could have fun while drawing female characters not just by making them appear &quot;cute,&quot; but also by making them &quot;seductive, or even evil.&quot; He added that, since Yumi had a &quot;sexed-up body,&quot; botching even one line could make the character appear &quot;downright indecent.&quot; Watsuki stated that in this way, Yumi taught him the importance of skillful sketching. She is portrayed by Maryjun Takahashi in live-action films.

===Juppongatana===
The are a group of ten elite assassins founded and commanded by Shishio Makoto to assassinate Meiji government officials upon their planned revolution. Based in Mount Hiei, they are the primary antagonist group of the Kyoto arc. Although he does not officially join them, Aoshi works with the Juppongatana in order to fight Kenshin again, even allowing them to attack Aoi-Ya. Watsuki said that several of his assistants suggested ideas for the Juppongatana and that many of the characters grew out of these ideas. In Watsuki&#x27;s original concept, except for Sōjirō none of the Juppongatana were intended to be &quot;lookers.&quot; The author added Kamatari and Fuji at a later point. When Watsuki felt that Saizuchi, had not been used to his full potential, in retrospect he wondered if having six or seven members of the organization would have been sufficient instead of ten.

====Sadojima Hōji====

, also known as , is Shishio&#x27;s second-in-command. He used to be an official in the Meiji government but lost faith in it when he saw no one in the government worthy of leading the country. He abandoned his position in the government and eventually met Shishio. Hōji envisions Japan as a mighty power led by Shishio, ruling with the principles of basic animal survival. Although he is not proficient in any fighting style, he is a cunning organizer and possesses formidable leadership qualities. He manages to acquire firearms on the black market and purchases the gigantic ironclad warship— without anyone knowing. Hōji&#x27;s plan with the Rengoku fails when Sanosuke blows it up with bombs. Hōji disagrees with Shishio using the Juppongatana to fight Himura Kenshin, believing they might lose, putting their actual goal to overthrow the government in jeopardy. But he strongly believes in Shishio&#x27;s strength, even throwing away a gun he had hidden after Shishio and Kenshin&#x27;s fight surpasses Shishio&#x27;s fifteen-minute time limit. He is in utter disbelief when Shishio finally loses upon bursting into flames and destroys Shishio&#x27;s hideout in an attempt to kill Kenshin and company rather than accept his master&#x27;s defeat. He is saved by Anji and then surrenders himself to the police, not for penance but to use the trial to project Shishio&#x27;s ideals and plans. However, he is never given a trial and, although he was offered a government job should he pledge loyalty to it, Hōji commits suicide in his cell; using his blood to write a final message detailing his disgust with the regime: &quot;The world is dead to me. I go to serve my lord in Hell.&quot; In Hell, Hōji is reunited with Shishio and vows to continue following him in his new quest to conquer Hell.

Watsuki stated that most of the overall concept for Hōji originates from a character in &quot;X-Men&quot;, whose name sounds similar to Hōji&#x27;s; the &quot;X-Men&quot; character gave him a &quot;hint&quot; for the story but not Hōji&#x27;s personality. The &quot;X-Men&quot; character does not directly fight but instead invents machines to help his team members, so Watsuki wanted a character who held a support role in the Juppongatana. At first Hōji was just an individual who was surprised a lot, but Watsuki realized that would &quot;get awfully dull.&quot; When he decided to look at Hōji as Shishio&#x27;s &quot;Number Two&quot; man (like Hijikata Toshizō or Shokatsuryō Kōmei) it &quot;strummed the chords of [his] heart,&quot; and ideas came one after another until Hōji became one of his favorite characters. Watsuki stated that Hōji&#x27;s character design is &quot;100% original&quot; to him and that it is one of which he is the most confident. Watsuki added that the one aspect he did not like about Hōji is his costume; he had wanted to make it more like the &quot;European style authentic&quot; to the period but could not find any resources. The author revealed that by the end of the Kyoto arc, Hōji would become &quot;a pretty cool guy.&quot;

====Seta Sōjirō====

, also known as , is a teenage boy who is Shishio&#x27;s right-hand man and the strongest of the Juppongatana. He is noted in the series for always smiling and lacks any emotion but &quot;comfort,&quot; making him impossible to read. He has been with Shishio the longest and is the most trusted member of the Juppongatana, having met Shishio when he was a small boy. He had witnessed Shishio brutally killing police officers, but Shishio ordered him to keep him in a safe house and provide for him instead of killing him. Days pass and Sōjirō tended to him and explained his situation with his abusive relatives. Shishio then explained his creed of survival of the fittest and gives him his sword. When Sōjirō is caught harboring Shishio in his family&#x27;s rice silo, his older relatives try to kill him, thinking they can pin it on Shishio. As a result, Sōjirō kills them in self-defense and goes off with Shishio to become his protege.

====Yūkyūzan Anji====

, also known as after Fudō Myō-ō, is a warrior monk and member of the Juppongatana. Anji is the third strongest and most merciful of the Juppongatana and has agreed with Shishio that Anji shall decide whether someone lives or dies. He fights alongside Shishio to destroy the Meiji government who did nothing to stop the anti-Buddhist purge which resulted in the destruction of his home and the deaths of the five orphaned children he cared for in his temple, who came from families who were killed during the Boshin War. Though he is a &quot;fallen priest,&quot; who feels no shame in violating the directives of Buddha, he still wishes to save the world, but believes in doing so by killing those who are evil to save the pure. Over ten years he developed the technique, which delivers two hits within 1/75 of a second, allowing him to smash rocks with his limbs. Upon meeting Sagara Sanosuke in a forest, he teaches him his secret technique, without realizing Sanosuke is allied with Kenshin. Although Anji is a master of the technique, his later fight with Sanosuke ends when Sanosuke creates the &quot;Mastery of &quot;Three&quot; Layers&quot; and Anji drops to his knees when Sanosuke points out that the orphans&#x27; souls do not care about his mission to save the world, they only want him to be happy. After Shishio&#x27;s death, Anji chooses to serve 25 years in a Hokkaidō prison. Five years later, Anji was transferred out of prison to Hakodate by its Kendo instructor Sugimura Yoshie (Nagakura Shinpachi), reuniting with former Juppongatana member Seta Sojiro on the way.

Watsuki developed Anji before the publication of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;; he appears as an extra in the second &quot;Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot; one-shot. However, he had difficulty determining Anji&#x27;s backstory and whether he would be a friend or foe, so he put Anji in &quot;storage&quot; until his ultimate introduction. Having determined that Sanosuke needed to become more powerful, Watsuki introduced Anji as a counterpart to Sanosuke&#x27;s fighting style, so that he could give Sanosuke a strong opponent and increase Sanosuke&#x27;s power at the same time. Watsuki had no model for Anji&#x27;s personality, but pictured him as being similar to Shinsengumi lieutenant Shimada Kai due to the &quot;manly air.&quot; He also said that Anji is his second attempt at &quot;manly intelligence,&quot; following the &quot;failed&quot; Isurugi Raijūta. Anji&#x27;s visual model originates from the lead vocalist of a punk band called Angie, and his name originates from the band&#x27;s as well. Watsuki said that their bandannas on shaved heads and the black makeup under the eyes looks &quot;cool&quot; but still gives an impression suggesting intelligence. Instead, he intended to give Anji a &quot;power-fighter&quot; design but settled for &quot;macho&quot;. Although the reader response to Anji&#x27;s story was mostly positive, looking back on it Watsuki said he was an immature writer then. Watsuki planned to have more to Anji&#x27;s story, but with five weeks&#x27; worth of material, he had to significantly cut it down so it would not interrupt the flow of the fighting; he originally planned to have Anji&#x27;s heart momentarily stop due to the &quot;Mastery of Three Layers.&quot; The author assesses that if one reads into the story deeply enough, one can see that Anji&#x27;s &quot;rampage&quot; to the dark side was stopped. Still, his soul has yet to be &quot;saved.&quot; Watsuki said that while he had nothing specific about Anji&#x27;s later adventures, they were slowly coming to him and he might write it down if the chance presents itself. Anji came in tenth place in the series&#x27; second character popularity poll.

====Sawagejō Chō====

, also known as , is a swordsman and member of the Juppongatana. A native of Osaka, Chō has a very calm and relaxed exterior and keeps typically one eye closed when talking, only opening both eyes when excited in the heat of battle. He speaks with an Osaka-ben accent. He possesses quite a collection of rare and unusual swords, including; a double-bladed blade known as and his favorite, a thin long flexible sword he keeps hidden wrapped around his waist named . Having heard of Arai Shakkū&#x27;s last sword, Chō intimidates Arai Seikū&#x27;s wife into revealing its location; the blade was offered to a temple. Because he takes Seikū&#x27;s son Iori with him, Kenshin fights Chō even though his sakabatō is broken. After hearing him talk of the new era, Seikū entrusts Kenshin with his father&#x27;s last sword. Despite assuming the sword to be a normal one, Kenshin is forced to use it to stop Chō; only to learn that it is another sakabatō. After Shishio&#x27;s death, Chō, who was given a full pardon in exchange for information, pays Kenshin and his friends a visit to inform them of what has happened to the members of the Juppongatana before going to work under Saitō as a spy and informant. He later appears several times in the Jinchū arc investigating or relaying information about Enishi. In the anime, Chō later appears when he tries to attack Amakusa but is soundly defeated.

Watsuki had no particular model for Chō&#x27;s personality, but said that if he had to give one, it would be the stereotyped depictions of people from the Kansai region. An assistant from Kansai checked Chō&#x27;s accent, but Watsuki had it &quot;broken down&quot; so that everyone from Japan can understand it; meaning Chō&#x27;s Kansai accent differs from the actual one. Watsuki created Chō&#x27;s basic design when he was 20 years old; originally designed to be a space alien. While Watsuki did not use the alien aspect, he said the &quot;horse-headed monkey-face&quot; was &quot;hard to throw out completely,&quot; so he used it for Chō. The original design had black, &quot;messy&quot; hair swept back, but he gave Chō a &quot;punk rock&quot; quality to give the character more impact as the first Juppongatana member shown. Despite being a villain, Chō was a popular character with &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; readers; Watsuki said that characters with Kansai dialects are &quot;&quot;always&quot; pretty popular.&quot; Because he also enjoyed drawing Chō, the author felt it would be &quot;a waste&quot; to &quot;finish off&quot; Chō after the conclusion of the Iori story and therefore had him reappear at later points. But in &quot;a bit more of a neutral position&quot; since Watsuki felt it would be strange for Chō to &quot;become friendly with Kenshin and the others.&quot; Chō ranked ninth in the &quot;Who is Kenshin&#x27;s Biggest Rival?&quot; poll. He is portrayed by Ryosuke Miura in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno&quot; and &quot; Rurouni Kenshin: The Final&quot; .

====Uonuma Usui====

, also known as , is a member of the Juppongatana. Equal to Sōjirō in strength, he is the member most feared by Shishio. Before the revolution, he was a swordsman working for the Shogun as an anti-&quot;hitokiri&quot;. In a fight against Shishio, he was blinded in both eyes and has trained to take revenge ever since. Usui and Shishio made a deal upon him joining the Juppongatana; Usui can try to kill Shishio anytime he gets the chance. A native of the Ryukyu Islands, Usui fights using a short spear with a weighted end - the &quot;rochin&quot; - to attack, and a tortoise shell - the &quot;tinbei&quot; - as a shield to deflect attacks and block the enemy&#x27;s vision. He possesses the , which is actually superhuman hearing that lets him hear another&#x27;s a heartbeat, muscle contractions and bone friction thus enabling him to read their emotions and physical position. Usui dies when his body is ripped in half by Saitō&#x27;s attack.

Usui originated from a chat Watsuki had with one of his assistants who proposed a blind swordsman. Although originally not interested in the idea, Watsuki decided to go with it after discussing the Shingan ability that read people&#x27;s emotions by listening to their heartbeat and pulse. The original plan was to have Usui fight Kenshin right after he fought Chō - chasing him down in the city like the Terminator. Still, the plot went in a different direction, with Usui fighting and dying at the hands of Saitō. Watsuki stated that the Terminator-like character he did not use would show up after the Kyoto arc. The author said he regretted creating Usui like he regretted creating Raijūta, but that Usui became more popular and therefore &quot;that must also mean&quot; Usui is stronger. The model for Usui&#x27;s design is Taopaipai from &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; by Akira Toriyama; Watsuki said that as the first villain to defeat Son Goku, Taopaipai made &quot;a strong impression.&quot; As for the &quot;eyeball-covered costume,&quot; Watsuki originally planned to give Usui a plain &quot;tribal&quot; outfit, but scratched that idea after seeing the &quot;spider-like angel&quot; in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. He originally planned to make Usui a &quot;handsome, long-haired type.&quot; Still, when he saw a rough sketch of the concept, it looked too much like Ukyō from &quot;Samurai Spirits&quot;, so he started over. Despite Usui&#x27;s final look originating from several different sources, Watsuki believed &quot;it came out pretty well.&quot; Usui came in seventeenth place in the second character popularity poll of the series.

====Honjō Kamatari====

, also known as , is a crossdressing member of the Juppongatana. A biological man with a feminine appearance, he is homosexual and loves Shishio deeply. But knows that he will never be loved like Yumi, with whom he has a rivalry, nor will he ever become as talented as Sōjirō. Kamatari is one of the Juppongatana sent to attack Aoi-Ya. He uses a very heavy scythe-like weapon with a chain and a ball on end. His special techniques are , where the scythe is whipped over his head and the chain forms a sphere, therefore creating both an offensive and defensive attack. makes use of his broken scythe by twirling the blade and chain rapidly like the blade of a helicopter. Kaoru and Misao defeat Kamatari in a two-on-one battle. He then tries to commit suicide with a needle, but Misao knocks him unconscious, preventing him from driving it into his neck. Pardoned for his crimes, the government hopes to use Kamatari as a foreign spy under the guise of an exchange student, but his sadness over Shishio&#x27;s death has him contemplating suicide. So Chō lies to Kamatari, claiming that Shishio wanted the Juppongatana to live and spread his story to prevent the government from rewriting it in the event of their loss.

The concept for Kamatari originated from a play on words by Watsuki&#x27;s assistant Eiichiro Oda; in Japanese, is a slang word for homosexual, while the word for a scythe is . Watsuki used ideas from assistants to create many of the Juppongatana and Kamatari was one he seized immediately. Still, when coming up with the specifics, the concept &quot;just wasn&#x27;t coming together.&quot; In the beginning, some of his ideas were &quot;male-appearing on the surface, but personality-wise, will be feminine,&quot; &quot;A very erotic and seductive, womanly appearance from the outside, but a manly man on the inside,&quot; and &quot;a big macho gay guy.&quot; But a friend of Watsuki&#x27;s suggested making Kamatari &quot;just a &#x27;pretty girl&#x27; type,&quot; leading to the solidification of the character. Watsuki planned for Kamatari to have a &quot;light-hearted and cheerful&quot; personality, but found complications when a &quot;more serious side&quot; began to emerge, leading him to feel some regret with the outcome; he admitted that one of his bad habits is to cross the fine line between &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;. Watsuki added that the next time he uses the character, he would try to &quot;keep his outlook sunny&quot; while not compromising the &quot;essential self.&quot; Watsuki used Ikari Yui from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; as the visual model for Kamatari&#x27;s face; but colored the hair black, exposed more of the forehead, and had the back of Kamatari&#x27;s hair &quot;flip out as I&#x27;ve seen so many high-schoolers do these days.&quot; Watsuki found that the character&#x27;s triangular silhouette has influences from Rei-Rei in &quot;Vampire Hunter&quot;. The large chain-scythe that Kamatari uses exists in real life, but Watsuki made the blade larger to give it &quot;a real super-impact look&quot; and noted that it is not intended to be used in the way that Kamatari does. Kamatari came in sixteenth place in the series&#x27; second character popularity poll and tenth in the third.

====Kariwa Henya====

, known as the , is a member of the Juppongatana sent to attack Aoi-Ya. He wears a black cloth over his mouth and what looks like a black robe, but turns out to be a glider shaped like bat wings folded around his body. His battle technique is called , in which he uses dynamite to lift himself into flight and attack from above with a blade on his arm before blowing himself back into the air. The power of flight is harnessed thanks to Henya starving himself to extreme emaciation; he is so light that the constant uplift from the explosions can easily keep him in the air with the wings. Yahiko defeats Henya by gliding on a shōji door blown up by Henya&#x27;s dynamite and attacking him from above. Henya is pardoned for his crimes and used as an army spy in Asia by the government because of his aviation abilities.

Henya was modeled after Matsubayashi Henyasai, a swordsman in the early Edo period who possessed &quot;avoidance techniques,&quot; which would now be called acrobatics in the modern era. Watsuki revealed that he originally planned to introduce Henya as a tengu during the Megumi arc as part of the Oniwabanshū. Still, that story was &quot;not as well-planned as it otherwise might have been,&quot; so the chance was lost and Henya had to become one of the Juppongatana. It was originally planned for Henya to engage in a mid-air battle with Kenshin. Still, Watsuki felt that Kenshin had become too strong after learning the secret &quot;Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū&quot; technique, so Yahiko became his opponent instead. Henya&#x27;s design model was a bat with a streamlined head and &quot;a little bit&quot; of Cyborg 002 from &quot;Cyborg 009&quot;. The author intended for Henya to be &quot;monster-like&quot; since none of the Juppongatana aside from Sōjirō were supposed to be &quot;lookers.&quot; Watsuki reported that some people felt that Henya was &quot;&quot;still&quot; too good-looking,&quot; so he made his body &quot;super-emaciated.&quot; He said that Freak from &quot;Spawn&quot; was also a reference for Henya.

====Iwanbō====

, also known as , is a fat oaf and one of the Juppongatana sent to attack Aoi-Ya. He fights using small blades worn on his fingertips and his large body; his skin is too thick to cut. He is very stupid and says very little. Despite defeating four members of the Kyoto Oniwabanshū by himself, Iwanbō flees when Henya and Kamatari are defeated. After Shishio&#x27;s defeat, Chō remarks that Iwanbō is too stupid to do anything on his own. Iwanbō is later shown to be a karakuri puppet controlled from the inside by Gein. Gein uses the new Iwanbō Version Three, Savage Mode to fight Kenshin during the Six Comrades&#x27; attack on Kamiya dojo. This version has unrestricted detachable joints, allowing every limb to move in any direction, and anti-piercing armor of woven steel protecting Gein inside. It is defeated when Kenshin lodges debris in its internal gears to stop its offense, and then destroyed by his strongest technique.

Following having a &quot;giant&quot; in the Juppongatana (Fuji), Iwanbō was created as a &quot;full body costume.&quot; Although Watsuki admitted he might have included too many elements from the Kyoto arc in the Jinchū arc, he said he enjoyed the character of Iwanbō. Because he had to hide that it was just a costume, the author portrayed Version One as a very mysterious character, but the design kept changing and he became a &quot;weird, but likable personality.&quot; Version Two was not intended to appear, but because Gein broke Version One, Watsuki had to &quot;cut and paste&quot; and later utilized this in the story. Version Three had to fight Kenshin and therefore was made into a &quot;powerful suit.&quot; After all this, the author reflected that he seems to have gotten carried away, making Iwanbō feel out of place in the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; universe. The design models for Version One (and Two) were the characters Blob and Mojo from &quot;X-Men&quot;. But elements of Victor and Sasquatch from &quot;Vampire Hunter&quot; were also incorporated, making him &quot;cuter.&quot; The design model for Version Three was the comic book character Hulk, specifically the version that was on &quot;Marvel X&quot;, a small booklet included in an issue of &quot;Wizard&quot; in relation to &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;. Version Three&#x27;s full-body tattoo was added to give him the look of a &quot;battling tribe&quot; from an undeveloped world, but Watsuki said it does not look that good.

====Saizuchi====

, also known as , is a member of the Juppongatana and a cunning elder who manipulates the giant Fuji. Saizuchi&#x27;s talents lie not in battle-abilities, but his proficient use of words. Having taken Fuji in after he was nearly killed, Saizuchi reminds Fuji that he has to repay him. During the Juppongatana&#x27;s attack of Aoi-Ya, Saizuchi attempts to destroy the morale of the Oniwabanshū by giving a speech as to why it is impossible for them to defeat Fuji and himself. Saizuchi is knocked unconscious when Fuji&#x27;s left arm falls on him upon being defeated by Hiko Seijūrō. Pardoned for his crimes, Saizuchi uses his gifts of persuasion for the Foreign Ministry in secret negotiations.

The overall model for Saizuchi is a villainous elf who tricks the giant in what Watsuki was told is a Finnish folktale called &quot;Frost Giant&quot;; he combined that with an &quot;image of a giant-robot pilot.&quot; Originally Watsuki planned for Okina to fight Saizuchi, but he cut the concept because he wanted to maintain the balance of the story and because his &quot;inner story-editor&quot; asked him if anyone would really like to see &quot;two old codgers&quot; fight each other. The design model is Director-General Luchi of the Akuda Republic from &quot;Purin Purin Monogatari&quot;, an NHK puppet show. Watsuki said that the large size of Director-General Luchi&#x27;s head would &quot;freak me out.&quot; Watsuki commented that Luchi&#x27;s design was &quot;efficient&quot; since one could tell that he was brilliant at one glance. Watsuki felt that of all the Juppongatana, Saizuchi got the &quot;short end of the stick&quot; since the character did not have a chance to fully display what his &quot;massive brain could do.&quot; He described this as the &quot;Senkaku Effect,&quot; where the characters with the &quot;best noggins&quot; are not used to their &quot;full potential.&quot;

====Fuji====

, also known as , is a member of the Juppongatana and a giant. Considered a freak by everyone around him, one day he was attacked and almost killed but Saizuchi found him and took him in. The gentle, depressed Fuji was in an ideal state for Saizuchi to manipulate his emotions and turn him into an unbelievable fighter. Saizuchi keeps telling Fuji that he owes him for saving his life and uses that to control him. Fuji is easily defeated by Hiko Seijūrō, who acknowledges Fuji&#x27;s samurai soul and was the first to look at Fuji as someone other than a monster. Pardoned for his crimes, the Meiji government assigns Fuji to Hokkaidō to develop land and act as a defending fighter during times of war.

The idea for a giant originated from the God Warrior in the &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, after Watsuki saw the film. He wondered if it would &quot;even be interesting&quot; for Kenshin to fight a giant, but could not let it go and so decided to have Fuji fight Hiko instead. Watsuki revealed that he and his editor both had doubts about actually doing it because Fuji was so big, but friends and assistants told him it would be fun and he was pleased that it seemed to have paid off. Fuji also utilized inspiration from what Watsuki was told is a Finnish folktale called &quot;Frost Giant&quot;, in which a monster-like giant is revealed to have a heart. The design was inspired by the first Eva in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. The face originated from Eva #2, but Watsuki&#x27;s assistants believed the design looked too similar. So his then-assistant Hiroyuki Takei created a &quot;skull-like riff on Eva #1&quot; and Watsuki added the biting of his helmet&#x27;s anchor rope feature, finishing Fuji&#x27;s helmet face. Watsuki tried &quot;very hard&quot; to keep the body from being too similar to the Eva. Fuji&#x27;s actual face originates from Dogura Magura in &quot;Arabian Lamp-Lamp&quot; by Takeshi Obata; Watsuki wanted to work with the concept of a &quot;monstrous character who&#x27;s still somehow good looking,&quot; which Watsuki says Dogura Magura is &quot;the epitome of.&quot; The author admitted that due to the &quot;tight&quot; schedule of the Fuji chapters, he had insufficient time to revise the design, resulting in &quot;an essentially unoriginal face.&quot;

===Six Comrades===

The are a group of six men who each seek revenge against Himura Kenshin for their own reasons. Financed and conceived by Yukishiro Enishi, they are the primary antagonist group of the Jinchū arc. Rather than simply kill Kenshin, they decide they must make him recognize his past crimes first. The group agreed to disband then and whoever gets to Kenshin first gets to kill him. Because many of the Juppongatana were characters that were &quot;hard to hate,&quot; Watsuki wanted to make the five comrades (excluding Enishi) in this storyline as &quot;scum-like&quot; as possible. But because he created villains with no ideals or beliefs, it was not easy to portray them as an enjoyable read.

====Yukishiro Enishi====

 is the mastermind, financier and member number one of the Six Comrades, and the primary antagonist of the Jinchū arc. The younger brother of Yukishiro Tomoe, Enishi seeks revenge against Kenshin for killing his sister fifteen years earlier. In China, he taught himself the style, which was derived from Japanese kenjutsu. He is the head of a black market weapons smuggling organization that he runs with Woo Heishin.

====Gein====
, the , is a member of the Six Comrades and the puppeteer behind Juppongatana member Iwanbō. Gein was tasked with assembling the Six Comrades and acquiring them a mansion in Yokohama, while Enishi was still in Shanghai. However, Gein does not actually seek revenge against Kenshin. He is the last remaining descendant of a family who mastered the art of karakuri in the Middle Ages. He creates puppet-like suits out of human corpses, most notably the Iwanbō series. Gein is an older man, yet he is remarkably strong due to controlling his heavy puppets for so long. The diamond-edged steel wires he uses, , to control his puppets can also be used as a weapon as they are sharp enough to cut flesh and break bone. Gein just wants to test out his creations and needs to be around men of battle to do it since, according to him, the forefront of technology is always in battle. This is also the reason why Gein joined Shishio. During the attack on Kamiya dojo, Gein fights Kenshin by operating a new version of Iwanbō. For Enishi&#x27;s Jinchū he creates a corpse doll of Kaoru to fool Kenshin into thinking she had been killed by Enishi, he considers this his masterpiece. Having completed his job, Enishi and Woo Heishin both decide to have Gein killed during his return boat ride to Tokyo, but Gein easily kills the large group of martial artists who attack him. When retrieving his Kaoru doll from the graveyard, he runs into a trap set by Aoshi, who knew that the corpse was a fake. Aoshi kills Gein after having him divulge where the real Kaoru is.

Gein originated from serial killer Ed Gein, who made lampshades and chairs out of corpses, combined with the puppet master required by the story. Watsuki suggested Gein might have been one of the most popular of the Six Comrades based on the many negative comments he got when he unveiled his face, like he did with Han&#x27;nya. He wanted to &quot;challenge a good-looking masked character like Char from &quot;Gundam&quot;.&quot; Gein&#x27;s obsession with functional and physical beauty comes from the author&#x27;s own. Gein had no model in terms of physical design; his costume mixes the outfits worn by stage crew and a skull mark from his &quot;necromancer&quot; image. This minimal &quot;highlights&quot; outfit was a successful experiment for Watsuki&#x27;s next work where he hoped to have fewer highlights to save time. Gein ranked eighth in the &quot;Who is Kenshin&#x27;s Biggest Rival?&quot; poll. In the first live-action film, Gein appears as one of Kanryū&#x27;s men and is portrayed by Gō Ayano.

====Kujiranami Hyōgo====
, the , is a large one-armed man and member of the Six Comrades. While shown to be a relatively selfless person when first introduced, his nature is later distorted until he reaches the point of insanity. During the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in the Bakumatsu, Kujiranami&#x27;s right arm was cut off by Kenshin. Kujiranami requested that Kenshin kill him since he did not want to live to see an era where wars are fought with guns instead of swords, absent of skill and soul. However, Kenshin refused, saying that he did not want to kill any more than he needed to and that Kujiranami should live in the new era. Already feeling that he had been robbed of a warrior&#x27;s pride and era, being robbed of a warrior&#x27;s death was the last straw for Kujiranami. Since then he vowed to kill Kenshin for dishonoring him and joined the Six Comrades to get his revenge. Enishi gave Kujiranami an Armstrong cannon to replace his missing arm which Kujiranami uses to blow up the Akabeko and Chief Uramura&#x27;s home. During the attack on Kamiya dojo, he is taken down by Saitō and arrested, but later goes berserk in his jail cell and breaks out. He gets the upgraded weapon he received from Enishi, a grenade launcher, and goes on a rampage in Tokyo searching for Kenshin. Yahiko is the only one around to fight Kujiranami at the time and manages to hold him off until Kenshin arrives and cuts off his grenade launcher, which returns his sanity. Afterwards Yahiko manages to convince Kujiranami that his hatred for a fellow samurai is wrong and has done nothing for him except lead him down the wrong path. Moved to tears by Yahiko&#x27;s words, Kujiranami accepts that he was wrong, apologizes to Kenshin and turns himself back into the police.

The idea for a one-handed fighter originates from Iba Hachirō, a swordsman from the Bakumatsu. Watsuki originally planned to make Enishi one-handed, but after considering the problems involving a one-handed swordsman facing the skilled Kenshin and deciding that &quot;boss fights&quot; should simply involve a sword versus a sword, he made Kujiranami one-handed instead. Kujiranami would be the Terminator-like character that Watsuki initially planned for Usui, but the idea was scrapped again due to him and his assistants being exhausted at the time. The design model for Kujiranami is Apocalypse from &quot;X-Men&quot;, one of Watsuki&#x27;s favorite villains. He felt that Apocalypse&#x27;s lips are &quot;quite interesting,&quot; so he gave Kujiranami similar lips. Another theme used is &quot;macho middle age fatness,&quot; which the author enjoyed depicting. Kujiranami ranked tenth in the &quot;Who is Kenshin&#x27;s Biggest Rival?&quot; poll.

====Inui Banjin====
 is a bloodthirsty, camouflage-wearing, hand-to-hand fighter and member number four of the Six Comrades. Inui wears gauntlets on his wrists called that can deflect any attack, even bullets, due to their angled design, and despite their thinness. Inui is skilled in , which is an amalgamation of various styles of martial arts. He is the student of Tatsumi who was killed by Kenshin fifteen years ago. Inui does not seek to avenge his master&#x27;s death, whom he calls a loser, but is using it as an excuse to fight and prove how powerful he is. He likes to boast about being invincible and undefeated, but Sano figures out that Banjin is full of himself from wearing the gauntlets and that he only fights people weaker than him. Inui attacks Maekawa dojo as part of the Jinchū campaign while Otowa Hyōko simultaneously attacks Chief Uramura&#x27;s house. During the encounter, Sanosuke wrecks one of his gauntlets with the Mastery of Two Layers. After receiving a pair of upgraded gauntlets from Enishi, the &quot;Neo-Invulnerable Gauntlets&quot;, he fights Sano again during the attack on Kamiya dojo. In the end Inui provokes Sano into attacking him with the Mastery of Two Layers again and is defeated as a result with both of his gauntlets destroyed. After being taken down, Inui vows to kill Sano next time and Sano welcomes him to try but warns him that he will not win as long as he wears the gauntlets to cover his weakness. Banjin is arrested by the police afterwards.

Originally considered for the Juppongatana, Inui started as a &quot;camouflage costume character.&quot; Then he was going to have army style hand-to-hand combat, but when it was questioned whether or not such a thing existed in this time period, he changed to being a combined martial-arts user, with gauntlets added for uniqueness. His personality is that of a &quot;very lively idiot&quot; and is taken from Kazama Kazuki in &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;. Kangetsu was also the design model for the character, specifically the version of Kangetsu that appears at the end of the game. Watsuki said that because a lot of different concepts went into Inui, he looks weird, which the author greatly regrets. He also regrets him looking too much like Kangetsu, and vowed that this would be the last time he uses &quot;Samurai Spirits&quot; as a design. However, Watsuki said he likes Inui quite a bit, and would like to create more of these &quot;stupid types&quot; in his next work. In the first live-action film, Inui appears as one of Kanryū&#x27;s men and is portrayed by Genki Sudo. In the fourth film, his equivalent Inui Tenmon is portrayed by Joey Iwanaga.

====Otowa Hyōko====
, the , is member number five of the Six Comrades and an effeminate-looking user of assassin&#x27;s weapons or &quot;Instruments of the Shadows&quot;. He says he has thirteen hidden weapons all over his body, but only four are shown in the series. The first is , a small six-barreled arrow-launcher worn on his left wrist. The second is the , a paralyzing mist generated by dropping two small cubes into water. The third is a jar of iron powder, , used in conjunction with his magnetic . The last is the , six long piercing tentacle-like appendages worn on his torso. His battle tactic is to outwit the opponent and catch them off guard with his hidden weapons as opposed to simply overpowering them. Otowa is a sadistic individual who enjoys killing people for fun and is not above targeting women and children. Otowa seeks Kenshin&#x27;s death in revenge for the death of his friend Nakajō, whom he had competitive killing sprees with. In reality Otowa joined the fight just for pleasure. Otowa attacks Chief Uramura&#x27;s house as part of the Jinchū campaign while Inui simultaneously attacks Maekawa dojo. Otowa later fights Myōjin Yahiko during the attack on Kamiya dojo. He comes close to killing Yahiko with a few of his weapons, but Yahiko eventually defeats him. As Otowa goes down he has a crazed smile on his face as he could not believe his defeat at the hands of someone not even half his age;. However, Sanosuke notes Otowa was not in peak form because he feared Kenshin&#x27;s abilities and thought of fleeing after the duel with Yahiko. Otowa is arrested by the police afterwards.

Watsuki had no personality model for Otowa and made him cruel because he is a shadow instrument user, which he notes resulted in him being like Kanryū. The author wanted to make him more cunning and sadistic, but said Otowa was not developed satisfactorily due to his own incompetence. Otowa&#x27;s design model was a previously rejected &quot;drag queen-ish&quot; villain who wore a lot of lipstick. The six-pronged accessory was borrowed from Mr. Sinister in &quot;X-Men: Age of Apocalypse&quot;. Watsuki said that he feels Otowa is one of his better designed characters.

====Yatsume Mumyōi====
 is a member of the Six Comrades who hides himself from the others, such as by hiding in the ceiling. A member of a famous gold mining clan, family tradition led them to elongate the limbs of their members using metal rings to help them mine better via ; similar to neck rings. As a result, Yatsume&#x27;s limbs are about 1.5 times as long as normal, with the notable exception of his left arm, which is twice as long and equipped with metal claws. His teeth have also been sharpened into fangs from a young age, although his long tongue is natural. Fifteen years earlier, Yatsume took up fighting and joined the Yaminobu in order to support his clan, who had fallen on hard times due to depleted gold mines, by hoping to prove to the Tokugawa shogunate that their bodies had battle potential. But the Yaminobu were defeated by Kenshin and the Shogunate defeated by the Ishin Shishi. Yatsume wants revenge on Kenshin to uphold the laws of his clan (which state that anyone who sees a member of their clan must be killed) and for the misfortunes of his clan, which he blames on the Ishin Shishi and Kenshin. Before he can fight Kenshin however, he ends up fighting Saitō instead and is brutally maimed in defeat, despite having managed to outmaneuver the man&#x27;s trademark attack once. Kenshin stops Saitō from killing him and offers to let Yatsume fight him if he still wants to after healing, but suggests that he go up north and use his abilities to help his clan. He is arrested by the police afterwards.

Yatsume&#x27;s model was &quot;kumo otoko&quot; (&quot;Spider Man&quot;), not the American version, so he has similar roots as Han&#x27;nya. Because the &quot;freaks&quot; theme did not go so well with Han&#x27;nya, Yatsume is Watsuki&#x27;s second attempt at it. But the author said he was utterly defeated, citing Saitō as the biggest reason; any character turns into a weakling in front of Saitō, just like Usui did. Watsuki said that the body shaping is one of the ideas he likes, but seems a little unfitting for a shonen manga. Because body deformation is a sensitive issue, he had to be careful how he dealt with it, which might have detracted from the storyline as a whole. He stated that there would be no further attempts at the freaks theme because he believes that there needs to be more &quot;positive themes&quot; in shonen manga; but will still use it in terms of design. Watsuki admitted that the design model is all &quot;jumbled up.&quot; The silhouette version of Yatsume, seen before his full reveal, was modeled after the &quot;bandana mask version&quot; of Wolverine from &quot;X-Men&quot; and Carnage from &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. After being told by various people to &quot;do Spider-Man, or to do Spawn and such,&quot; Watsuki got agitated and said &quot;I&#x27;ll throw in Venom also!,&quot; which he referred to as digging his own grave. The gold-mining clan backstory was added after the fact, but Yatsume still stuck out from the period.

===Woo Heishin===
 is the second-in-command of Enishi&#x27;s black market organization that smuggles weapons from Shanghai to Japan. While Enishi likes to rule from action and fear, Heishin rules from careful planning, and this balance is what allowed their organization to grow so fast. He possesses no true fighting skills and is guarded by the Sū-shin, who are skilled in various fighting styles. In exchange for being allowed to use the organization&#x27;s resources for his personal Jinchū campaign, Enishi agreed to hand over total control of it to Heishin. After receiving control, Heishin tries to have the Sū-shin take Enishi&#x27;s revenge by killing Kenshin. But all four are defeated by Kenshin&#x27;s comrades, while Heishin is beaten up by Enishi. He later recovers and begins shooting with dual revolvers, managing to wound Kenshin before being beaten up by Enishi again, but just when Enishi is about to kill Heishin, Kenshin stops him.

Watsuki had no model for Heishin. He created him after his editor told Watsuki that he needed to put more depth into the black market weapons organization. Since the organization was made simply to explain Enishi&#x27;s finances, Watsuki believed that the addition of Heishin &quot;didn&#x27;t seem to change anything.&quot; The author felt that chapters flew by and he was unable to set Heishin&#x27;s personality, so he became &quot;this pathetic creature.&quot; Even though Heishin was his favorite &quot;#2,&quot; he became an unattractive character and Watsuki regretted how he turned out. Heishin also had no design model; he was designed around the time of the Tomoe chapters when Watsuki was aiming for originality and creating characters that did not obviously look like any other. Heishin was designed to be &quot;heavy&quot; on black to contrast with the &quot;whiteness&quot; of Enishi.

===Sū-shin===
The are Woo Heishin&#x27;s personal bodyguards. They are identical quadruplets named after the four symbols of Chinese astrology, and each versed in a different form of combat. Heishin tries to have the Sū-shin take Enishi&#x27;s revenge by killing Kenshin, but Kenshin&#x27;s friends take them on so he can save his energy for Enishi. fights using a naginata-like weapon and prides himself on being able to determine his opponents moves and conquer them. He lets himself be hit by Saitō&#x27;s &quot;Gatotsu&quot; and correctly identifies its weakness as the blind spot created by extending the right hand as a counterweight. But Saitō defeats him with the move regardless by using his right hand to grab Seiryū by the mouth. fights using two swords and prides himself on being able to mimic his opponents moves. He perfectly mimics Aoshi&#x27;s dual sword attacks and is even faster than him, but Aoshi defeats him using martial arts. fights using his fists and spiked knuckle blades and prides himself on simply attacking. Although he delivers a lot of blows, Sanosuke defeats Byakko as his attacks are too weak to do any damage. fights with what looks like a staff but is actually a retractable six-jointed mace and prides himself on his battle strategy. He is defeated when Yahiko uses the &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot; secret technique and ultimately destroys his mace.

The Sū-shin had no personality models and were created simply to &quot;fill out the numbers.&quot; As the story advanced towards Kenshin&#x27;s final battle, Watsuki realized that the other characters would have no &quot;glamour&quot; and created the Sū-shin on the spot. Because they were &quot;irresponsibly made,&quot; he initially named them the &quot;Four Stars&quot;, but changed it to the &quot;Four Gods&quot; and individually named them after the four godly beasts. He realized this and tried to fix the dialogue but it &quot;got weird&quot; and the fights were not as glamorous as he had hoped. This made him realize how important it is to decide the scenes and plot in advance. The Sū-shin had no design models either; it was simply an easy to draw design and making them quadruplets in Chinese clothes without any tone. Although you can tell them apart by their head tattoos and weapons.

===Yaminobu===
The were a group of assassins who were called the &quot;Oniwabanshū of the West&quot; and planned to kill Kenshin. They used Yukishiro Tomoe to get close to him and become his weakness. One of their members, , a wielder of dual-katana chained at their hilts was the assassin Kenshin killed in front of Tomoe. Finally setting their plan into action in December 1864, they send Enishi to contact Tomoe and leave a note luring Kenshin to their &quot;Binding Forest.&quot; Kenshin kills , a warrior who uses hidden weapons and successfully binds Kenshin&#x27;s hearing with an explosion, and , a large axe-wielder who binds his vision in another. Yatsume Mumyōi fights alongside Sumita but flees injured and vowing revenge; he later joins Enishi in the Six Comrades. With his senses impaired, Kenshin fights the leader , a hand-to-hand fighter. Although Tatsumi has the advantage, he is killed by Kenshin when Tomoe jumps in between them. was their spy in the Ishin Shishi. After Kenshin defeats the Yaminobu, Katsura Kogorō sends Shishio Makoto to kill I&#x27;izuka, having discovered his true affiliation.

===Fudōsawa===
 is a yakuza trying to take over a small town in Shinshū, former sumo wrestler, and nephew of Tani Jūsanrō. The only obstacle preventing him from taking over the town is the farmer Higashidani Kamishimoemon. Fudōsawa hires Sanosuke to fight the farmer, but Sanosuke realizes that Kamishimoemon is his father and that his family is being forced into poverty by Fudōsawa. Sanosuke defeats Fudōsawa&#x27;s army of 200 men single-handedly and injures Fudōsawa, breaking six of his ribs.

==Other characters==

===Hiko Seijūrō===

 is the thirteenth and current master of the 300-year-old &quot;Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū&quot; and Kenshin&#x27;s swordsmanship instructor, who now works as a potter under the alias . His imposing looks, unrivaled fighting prowess and inflated ego are trademarks of his character. Years ago, Seijūrō rescued a young boy named Shinta from a gang of bandits, took him under his wing and gave him the name &quot;Kenshin&quot;. He intended for the boy to one day succeed him as master of his deadly art, but the two severed ties when Kenshin abandoned his training in order to serve the Ishin Shishi. Fifteen years later, Kenshin seeks out Seijūrō and begs him to teach him the final technique of &quot;Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū&quot;. The master accepts after learning that Kenshin has spent a decade working for the weak and atoning for his sins. Seijūrō later appears when he assists the Kyoto branch of the Oniwabanshū by defeating the giant Fuji. He is portrayed by Masaharu Fukuyama in the live-action films.

Watsuki had no personality model for Hiko; when he imagined who the &quot;Master&quot; would be, the character initially became &quot;this arrogant, twisted guy.&quot; The design model for the Hiko in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is the character of the same name from his one-shot manga &quot;Crescent Moon of the Warring States,&quot; but Watsuki also added some influences from Hiken Majin Hajerun in Takeshi Obata&#x27;s &quot;Arabian Lamp-Lamp&quot;. When Hiko was placed in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, the author simplified the design, such as changing the hair to make it easier to draw. Watsuki said that Hiko&#x27;s body became &quot;more macho&quot; because he is a different kind of &quot;Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū&quot; swordsman and because of the addition of &quot;manliness.&quot; At the time, Watsuki said that he was fascinated by images of &quot;manliness&quot; and that Hiko is one of the first characters to reflect this fascination. His cloak originates from the American comic book series &quot;Spawn&quot;. As one of his favorite characters, Watsuki wanted to use Hiko more often, but because he is more powerful than Kenshin, it was too difficult to find a place to use him in the story. Hiko came in ninth place in the series&#x27; second character popularity poll and eighth in the third.

===Yukishiro Tomoe===
: 

 was the wife of Himura Kenshin and biological sister of Yukishiro Enishi. The daughter of an Edo retainer to the Shōgun, Tomoe was engaged to Kiyosato Akira (voiced by Tetsuya Iwanaga; portrayed by Masataka Kubota in the live-action films), the second son of another similarly ranked family. Despite her happiness at the arrangement, she is unable to express her emotions openly (hence her keeping diaries to record her inner thoughts and emotions). This reticence left Kiyosato unaware of her thoughts, and—thinking that he needed to please her with greater accomplishments—made him join the Kyoto Mimawarigumi. He was killed by Kenshin in 1864 in Kyoto, but not before injuring him with the first half of his cross-shaped scar. Around six months later, Kenshin sticks up for Tomoe against two Aizu samurai in a pub. Later when she tries to thank him, she witnesses him kill an assassin sent to kill him. She faints, though Kenshin knows he should kill her for being a witness, he can not bring himself to do so and takes her to his room at an inn housing his fellow Chōshū Ishin Shishi. He asks her to promise to forget what she saw and leave, but instead she starts to work at the inn and the two develop feelings for one another. Following the Ikeda-Ya and Kinmon incidents, the Chōshū are near ruin so Katsura Kogorō tells Kenshin to lay-low in a farm village and bring Tomoe to better blend in. Kenshin reveals to Tomoe that he does not want it only for appearance sake, and the two get married. When Enishi arrives to tell his sister that the Yaminobu operation to kill Kenshin is nigh, she sends him away, and subsequently reveals her past to Kenshin (but not about the current conspiracy). The following morning, Tomoe leaves Kenshin to meet with the Yaminobu in the hopes of misleading them and saving his life, only to find that she was nothing but a pawn in their plans, and ended up being used as bait to draw him in for the kill. In the middle of Kenshin&#x27;s duel with the leader of the Yaminobu, Tomoe throws herself between them. With his senses impaired, Kenshin is unable to see her until it is too late, and delivers a fatal blow to his opponent and to her with the same slash of his sword. The little sword she was holding falls from her hand and gives Kenshin the second part of his cross-shaped scar. A gravestone for Tomoe was erected in a Kyoto temple, where Kenshin also left her diaries.

Even though the plot for the &quot;remembrance episodes&quot; was already set before serialization started, which was three and a half years before her debut, Watsuki had no model for Tomoe other than a &quot;super beautiful woman whose intent was unclear&quot; or put simply &quot;cool beauty.&quot; He said she became an Ayanami lookalike, with the only unique feature being her black pupils. The author said he did not realize that because cool beauties do not show emotion, once she revealed her true feelings in the end, she becomes a completely different character. He also pointed out that her death is the same as Yumi&#x27;s. Watsuki said he not only regretted what he made her into, but was also &quot;disgusted with himself.&quot; He said he did enjoy the first half when she was a cool beauty and would like to bring her back in a different work. In the live action films, she is portrayed by Kasumi Arimura.

===Sekihara Tae===

 is the manager of the beef hot pot (gyūnabe) restaurant owned by her father, the in Asakusa. She is Yahiko and Tsubame&#x27;s boss, and Sanosuke owes her a seemingly large sum of money in which interest is accounted for. She tries to push the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru since it seemed it to her that it was not working. The Akabeko is destroyed by Kujiranami Hyōgo at the start of the Six Comrades&#x27; revenge against Kenshin, but it is re-opened at a temporary located soon after. She has an identical twin sister named who runs the family&#x27;s original restaurant, the in Kyoto.

Watsuki originally created Tae as a plot convenience during Sanosuke&#x27;s first appearance and he intended for Kaoru to patronize a restaurant operated by &quot;a good friend.&quot; Tae&#x27;s personality originates from Kamiya Megumi in Watsuki&#x27;s first &quot;Rurouni&quot; story. As the story progressed Watsuki found himself adding additional details such as her family name, her status as the daughter of the owner of &quot;Akabeko&quot;, and her collecting of nishiki-e paintings. He said that Tae was his first character to evolve in this manner and he would like it to continue to surprise himself. The author said he used &quot;no thought&quot; while creating Tae, including a lack of planning in her character design, which originates from a rejected model for Kenshin with a prototype Kenshin hairstyle colored black and a &quot;softer, female&quot; face. Tae has no lipstick so she would be easily distinguished from Megumi. Watsuki originally intended for Tae to have a Kansai dialect and had an assistant from the Kansai region vet the dialog, but Watsuki ultimately rejected the idea after he felt the concept was becoming too strange.

===Sanjō Tsubame===

 is a very shy and soft-spoken waitress at Tae&#x27;s restaurant who becomes Yahiko&#x27;s sweetheart. The former samurai her family worked for forces her to help him rob the Akabeko until he is defeated by Yahiko. When Himura Kenshin enters a deep depression after the supposed death of Kamiya Kaoru at the hands of Yukishiro Enishi, Tsubame pleads for Kenshin to help Yahiko fight back against one of Enishi&#x27;s abandoned allies. Tsubame and Yahiko become a couple, and Watsuki mentioned in his notes that they had a son, , who he considered using in a story idea, though he never did.

Watsuki said that he did not have a specific model for Tsubame&#x27;s personality. The storyline was created to act as a bridge to the Raijūta one and to give Yahiko the spotlight. The concept of &quot;a young girl being a young man&#x27;s motivation to act&quot; introduced her as the heroine. The author used Tsubame as a &quot;testament&quot; of the &quot;wrong thinking of a previous age&quot; and gave her a manner that contrasts with Yahiko&#x27;s &quot;acts-before-he-thinks&quot; manner. Her design model originated from a popular &quot;planet-themed&quot; anime series, particularly its character symbolized by the &quot;ringed-planet.&quot; As Tsubame is &quot;an average girl&quot; the author decided that her hair should either be in a bowl cut or in pigtails, and after watching that anime he decided on a bowl cut. In the final chapter Watsuki designed Tsubame to look &quot;as cute as possible&quot; since he wanted a story where she was the heroine. Her new waitress outfit, which looks like a maid outfit, was going to be for his next work, but because the maid style was already being overdone at the time, he decided to include it in a work before it went out of style. Tsubame&#x27;s name originates from places where Watsuki lived in Niigata. Tsubame came in fifteenth place in the series&#x27; second character popularity poll.

===Chief Uramura===

 is the police chief. Because their first meeting is during a disturbance caused by his subordinates, he decides not to pursue Kenshin for illegally carrying a sword and also learns that Kenshin is a good person despite his reputation as &quot;Hitokiri Battōsai&quot;. He becomes a friend of Kenshin&#x27;s and often informs him of local disturbances like when he requests assistance in stopping Udō Jin-e. During the Jinchū arc, Uramura&#x27;s house is attacked and destroyed by Otowa and Kujiranami as part of Enishi&#x27;s plan to strike at the places in Tokyo most important to Kenshin; but Uramura and his family are saved by Kenshin. As a favor to Kenshin, he deliberately points the police in the wrong direction when they attempt to arrest Sanosuke towards the end of the series. In the anime adaptation he is named .

===Oniwabanshū===

The were &quot;onmitsu&quot; or spies who protected Edo Castle from the shadows during the Edo period. In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, they are Shinomori Aoshi, Han&#x27;nya, Shikijō, Hyottoko, Beshimi, Okina, Misao, and the others at the Aoi-Ya. Aoshi&#x27;s group is referred as the Tokyo Group, while Misao and Okina&#x27;s squad is known as the Kyoto Group. After the Bakumatsu, of all of the Oniwabanshū members, only Aoshi received job offers from government agencies, such as army intelligence and protection services of political leaders; Aoshi instead chose not to abandon his men.

Watsuki described the addition of the Oniwabanshū as a &quot;last minute&quot; choice. When the author first discussed the &quot;Megumi arc&quot; with his editor, the editor replied that &quot;having a swordsman of Kenshin&#x27;s caliber fighting a group of punk-thugs still coming into their first facial hair mi-i-ight not make for the most epic of manga.&quot; To solve this, Watsuki modified the real and historic Oniwabanshū to make them onmitsu (what are now known as ninja or shinobi; Watsuki does not like using the word &quot;ninja&quot; as he feels that using it &quot;like that&quot; is &quot;cheesy&quot;), and added details as publication progressed. He did purposely want a variety of shapes and temperaments for the various Oniwabanshū characters.

====Beshimi====

 is the smallest of the Oniwabanshū and uses his stealth to compensate for his lack of strength. A cunning, but bottom-ranked onmitsu, Beshimi received no prosperous government job offers because of his physical competency in only one skill. His favorite weapons are spiral darts, with which he poisons Yahiko. He is gunned down by Kanryū&#x27;s Gatling gun trying to help save Aoshi. In the anime only, one of his darts jams Kanryū&#x27;s Gatling gun. Watsuki stated that Beshimi was &quot;largely created on-the-spot&quot; and does not have a motif. He said that without a personality set for him, the character turned out &quot;kind of timid.&quot; Not originally intended to be a standalone character, Beshimi became shorter than Kenshin to add variety to the Oniwabanshū. Watsuki said that Beshimi&#x27;s shortness and timidness gave him a group of fans who wrote to him calling the character &quot;cute.&quot;

====Hyottoko====

 is the large and fat member of the Oniwabanshū. A mid-ranked omnitsu, Hyottoko breathes fire at his opponents by means of a large oil bag he keeps stored in his stomach with a nozzle coming out of his mouth, that he ignites by using his false teeth of flint. Hyottoko received no prosperous government job offers because he had competency in one skill. Hyottoko dies while charging for Kanryū as an unsuccessful decoy for Beshimi. Watsuki said he had no particular motif while designing Hyottoko; using his rudimentary kanji knowledge (the name Hyottoko is formed by the kanji for &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Man&quot;), he created a fire-breather. The creator made Hyottoko fat since he wanted the Oniwabanshū to represent several shapes and sizes and because the character would have a bag of oil in his stomach. Watsuki said that since he had never drawn a figure like that before, he went through several designs until he found one he could draw comfortably and repeatedly. Watsuki decided to give Hyottoko the ability to breathe fire, because he felt it would be natural for an &quot;onmitsu&quot; to be &quot;flashy.&quot; Looking back, the author saw the character as somewhat out of place and &quot;not really organic&quot; to his world. According to Watsuki Hyottoko&#x27;s fire breathing and Kenshin&#x27;s sword spinning method to defeat it received criticism from fans, authors of dōjinshi fanzines, and personal friends. The author described Hyottoko as the guy who makes a big entrance and &quot;then gets just as spectacularly beaten,&quot; who is &quot;ridiculously confident&quot; and &quot;a bit of an idiot&quot;, but said that this is just the &quot;natural evolution of the character, I guess.&quot;

====Han&#x27;nya====

 is a skilled martial artist and was the master of intelligence for the Edo Castle Oniwabanshū. In the poor village he was born in, it is common to abandon a child at birth to reduce the number of people to feed. Han&#x27;nya survived and wandered around like an animal until Aoshi found him and trained him to be an Oniwabanshū. Thus he is extremely loyal to Aoshi, giving his life to allow Kenshin enough time to retrieve his sword to defeat Kanryū and save Aoshi. His arms have horizontal stripes painted on them, which gives them the appearance of being shorter than they actually are, thus luring opponents into a false sense of security regarding distance of attacks. He also wears steel gauntlets beneath his gloves, which help him to block attacks from other weapons. These gauntlets contain retractable steel claws, which he will resort to as a sort of trump card. Han&#x27;nya is also the master of disguise within the group; he gained his ability by removing all his prominent facial features, which is why he wears the demonic mask on his face. Han&#x27;nya burned his lips, cut off his ears and nose, and crushed his cheekbones so he could disguise himself as any individual. After the Bakumatsu, Han&#x27;nya received no prosperous government job offers because of his appearance.

Watsuki was originally going to base Han&#x27;nya off of the &quot;Elephant Man&quot;; intending for his face to be deformed because a person stepped on it while he was still in his mother&#x27;s womb. Other people would have treated Han&#x27;nya like a monster and therefore he would have lived alone in the mountains until Aoshi finds him. Han&#x27;nya would join the Oniwabanshū, becoming a tragic figure who finds his in fighting, saying &quot;Only in the Oniwabanshū am I able to live as a human being.&quot; Watsuki and his editor discussed how this could be interpreted meaning &quot;the shape of one&#x27;s destiny is determined by how one is born&quot; and whether or not this would be appropriate for a young men&#x27;s magazine. Watsuki decided a change needed to be made and said that for him Han&#x27;nya was a difficult character as it made him aware of the responsibilities of writing for young people. Han&#x27;nya&#x27;s personality is derived from Yamazaki Susumu, a member of the Shinsengumi. Some readers proposed that Han&#x27;nya had a handsome face under his mask, was Aoshi&#x27;s &quot;kagemusha&quot; (such as his twin brother), or was a &quot;kunoichi&quot;. The design model for Han&#x27;nya was a human skeleton. His left and right eyes being two different shapes and sizes originates from the elephant man concept. Watsuki said that Han&#x27;nya is not a character one would describe as &quot;evil.&quot; Han&#x27;nya came in fourteenth place in the series&#x27; third character popularity poll.

====Shikijō====

 is the musclebound hand-to-hand fighter of the Oniwabanshū and was keeper of the Edo Castle gate. Prior to joining the Oniwabanshū, Shikijō was an &quot;onmitsu&quot; for the Ishin Shishi in the Satsuma Domain. In 1866, Shikijō infiltrated Edo Castle to gather information about an upcoming battle and was defeated by the thirteen-year-old Shinomori Aoshi, who created the scars covering Shikijō&#x27;s body. Aoshi gave Shikijō a chance to join the Oniwabanshū and gain strength using their training methods and medicines. Shikijō received no prosperous government job offers because he was a traitor. Shikijō is mainly a hand-to-hand fighter but he also swings around a large ball and chain. He fights Sagara Sanosuke at Takeda Kanryū&#x27;s mansion and is defeated. He is the first to die at Kanryū&#x27;s hand, protecting Aoshi from the Gatling gun. Watsuki said that he modeled Shikijō after Sanosuke by giving Shikijō the same philosophy, strength, and personality. By putting them on opposite sides Watsuki intended to illustrate the differences between the two factions. Watsuki created Shikijō as a complete villain, but said that the &quot;noble manner&quot; of his death made the character &quot;a pretty cool guy.&quot; The author used no specific model for Shikijō&#x27;s design; giving him many muscles as the character is a &quot;power fighter,&quot; but feeling that Shikijō was not sufficiently &quot;strange-enough looking,&quot; Watsuki added scars and &quot;superhero-like exaggerated musculature.&quot;

====Okina====

, also known as , was a member of the Oniwabanshū during the Bakumatsu. Sent to Kyoto to set up an information network, the Aoi-Ya inn became his headquarters. Although old, Okina still possesses a quick mind and knows all that goes on in Kyoto as the old intelligence network is still active. Okina was expected to become the next leader of the Oniwabanshū but refused the position, saying that it was the time for the younger generation, and recommended Aoshi. He uses his network to help Kenshin find Arai Seikū and Hiko Seijūrō. When Aoshi allows Shishio&#x27;s men to attack Aoi-Ya, Okina challenges him to a duel for forgetting the dignity of the Oniwabanshū and becoming just another killer. Okina tends to like drinking games and pretty girls. He is often assisted by fellow ex-Oniwabanshū , , and who help run the Aoi-Ya, and look after Misao. He fights wielding steel tonfa to block sword blows.

Watsuki had no particular model for Okina&#x27;s personality; Okina is his image of an &quot;old soldier.&quot; Okina, a &quot;gentle, run-down-at-the-seams&quot; elderly man, summons his powers and corrects the younger generation when it is confused or does something wrong. Watsuki supposes that a bit of the character Kohei from Shōtarō Ikenami&#x27;s &quot;Kenkyaku Shōbai&quot; is in Okina. The author said that he likes Okina since as a character he was able to &quot;tie up loose ends.&quot; Okina&#x27;s design model is Tokijirō Kaizō from Takeshi Obata&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Watsuki said that while he was careful to not make Okina look too similar to his influence, his assistants guessed the design model right away. He expressed disappointment with Okina&#x27;s hair; he intended for it to stand up when Okina is very angry, making him resemble &quot;Sally&#x27;s dad from the anime.&quot; Because of a lack of available pages, Watsuki concluded &quot;this hasn&#x27;t ended up coming across too well.&quot; He is portrayed by Min Tanaka in the live-action films.

===Geezer===
 is a friendly old man who resides within the Fallen Village. When Kenshin falls into a deep depression after he believes that he had failed to protect Kaoru from being killed by Enishi, Geezer gently persuades Kenshin (partly through the use of &quot;hakubaikō&quot; perfume) to find his purpose to stand again rather than listen to his friends telling him to avenge Kaoru, who mean well but lack the insight to realize what Kenshin&#x27;s inner conflict is. He is then revealed to be the father of Yukishiro Tomoe and Enishi. He is aware that Tomoe has died and that Kenshin was her husband. Geezer is last seen with the broken Enishi in the Fallen Village; father and son remark that each other looks familiar, though it is left unknown whether either knows their connection.

Watsuki based Geezer off of an empty milk can who is a character in &quot;Now go, Robot!,&quot; a story by Makoto Ōishi. The motif of the entire plotline involving Kenshin in the Fallen Village is based on that same story, with it also taking influence from the comic &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; by Moebius. Watsuki used no design model for Geezer. He was created simply based on the attributes; homeless, &quot;an unusual personality,&quot; and not easily showing his true thoughts. Afterwards, Watsuki noticed that Geezer was very similar to Grandpa Bob in &quot;Hareluya II Boy&quot; by Haruto Umezawa.

===Tsukayama Yutarō===

 is a young boy and Isurugi Raijūta&#x27;s &quot;apprentice.&quot; Yutarō&#x27;s father, , is a former samurai who became rich by selling swords to Europeans. Yutarō feels that his father&#x27;s actions degrade him and wants to show him how a true samurai lives by the sword. The Tsukayama family was deceived by Isurugi Raijūta, who faked a robbery so the Tsukayama family would pay him to teach Yutarō how to use swords. Yutarō trains at Kamiya dojo a little and becomes Myōjin Yahiko&#x27;s rival, the two gaining a mutual desire to become better than the other. When Raijūta initiates a failed sneak attack on Kenshin&#x27;s group, he accidentally slices Yutarō&#x27;s right arm so that the nerves are severed, therefore making Yutarō unable to hold a sword with that hand. Yuzaemon takes Yutarō to Germany to get medical treatment. Before he leaves, however, Yahiko confronts him, scorns his sulking, and tells him that he can overcome his sorrow by working to be better than he imagined Raijuta to be. Yutaro responds that he will never stop practicing swordsmanship and his left arm is still enough to become great. At the end of the series, Yutarō&#x27;s name is listed as one of the acting instructors of the &quot;Kamiya Kasshin-ryū&quot; dojo, along with Yahiko.

In the anime Yutarō&#x27;s father, a well-known swordsman, is dead. Yutarō, who had inherited a lot of money after his parents died, wishes to learn swordsmanship to become as skilled as his father. When he sees Kenshin, he demands lessons on how to use a sword, but Kenshin refuses. Yutarō finds Raijūta, who plans to overthrow the Meiji government. During a scuffle one of Raijūta&#x27;s men accidentally hits Yutarō, causing him to fall into the ocean. After Kenshin rescues him Yutaro gets to know Kenshin&#x27;s group. In a similar manner Raijūta injures Yutarō&#x27;s right arm, and Yutarō goes to Germany for medical treatment.

Watsuki created Yutarō as Yahiko&#x27;s rival with no real model; while they both want to be stronger, their desires come the complete opposite places. He gave Yutarō the traits of admiring Kaoru, an older woman, and Kenshin&#x27;s strength but made him unable to &quot;be honest&quot; about it because they were Raijūta&#x27;s enemies, as aspects of his youth. Watsuki said that Yutarō is one of the &quot;good guys&quot; but because he was &quot;brought down a bit&quot; by the author&#x27;s &quot;most disgraceful character&quot; (Raijūta) he may not have been developed &quot;to his full extent.&quot; Yutarō&#x27;s design is also the opposite of Yahiko. Watsuki initially had difficulty with his hair, but once he got used to it, it became easy and he enjoyed drawing it. He also had difficulty in compensating for Yutarō&#x27;s black-less design on the page, which if he was not careful, would go all white. Yutarō came in eighth place in the series&#x27; first character popularity poll.

===Ōkubo Toshimichi===

, based on the historical figure of the same name, is the chief of the department of internal affairs, making him the most powerful man in Japan. One of the three great revolutionaries, he was a leader of the Satsuma clan, who supported the restoration of imperial power. Ōkubo appears, accompanied by superintendent general , to inform Kenshin that Shishio Makoto has amassed an army and plots to overthrow the government. He asks Kenshin to go to Kyoto and kill Shishio for the sake of the country. Returning a week later for Kenshin&#x27;s answer, Ōkubo is assassinated by Seta Sōjirō with seven Ishikawa Prefecture samurai taking responsibility.

Watsuki feels that many Japanese people have bias towards Saigō Takamori with Ōkubo being thought of as &quot;sly&quot; and &quot;cunning.&quot; The author expressed disappointment in this and instead stated that while Ōkubo was indeed a strategist during the Bakumatsu, he was ethical during the Meiji era and did not try to enrich himself personally through politics (like Saigō did). Watsuki feels that Ōkubo, who had been demonized during his time period, is an example of what a politician should be and needs more appreciation from the population. For his design, Watsuki wanted to use portrait photographs of Ōkubo, but could not find them. So he tried using a statue as a model, but believes that the final product does not look at all similar to the statue. In retrospect he believes that the character resembles President of the United States Abraham Lincoln, another historical figure that Watsuki has respect for. He is portrayed by Kazufumi Miyazawa in the live-action films.

===Himura Kenji===

 is the son of Kamiya Kaoru and Himura Kenshin that appears in the last chapter of the manga as a young child. Although he bears an uncanny resemblance to Kenshin, he is more fond of his mother and less caring towards his father (he has a habit of pulling Kenshin&#x27;s hair). He also appears in the follow-up chapter &quot;Yahiko&#x27;s Sakabatō&quot;, where he is about four years old and is seen training with a shinai.

Watsuki said that &quot;stupid&quot; was Kenji&#x27;s personality model, and described him as equivalent to Arai Iori. The author said that Kenji exists solely to be the son of Kenshin and Kaoru, and even though the character was &quot;cliché&quot;, he felt that Kenji had to appear. The author said that he is not &quot;twisted enough&quot; to place &quot;negative elements in the ideal family.&quot; Kenji&#x27;s character design is &quot;a small Kenshin.&quot;

===Tsukioka Tsunan===

, born , is a popular nishiki-e painter. Like Sanosuke, he was a child soldier of the Sekihō Army. For the past ten years he has cursed the Meiji government and created a cache of grenades to blow up the department of internal affairs. He recruits Sanosuke and they embark on their terrorist attack, but are stopped by Kenshin. After Kenshin buries his bombs, Tsukioka stops painting and starts his own newspaper to report the government&#x27;s wrongdoings. However, he still makes bombs solely as protection and gave several to Sanosuke just before he followed Kenshin to Kyoto. In the anime series, he becomes a valuable source of information for Kenshin and Sanosuke, serving as their intelligence source during the Feng Shui arc.

Watsuki said that Tsunan originated from a fake advertisement within the series, labeled &quot;Mysterious Artist Appears.&quot; When he decided to do the extra Sanosuke chapters he created a &quot;comrade from the Sekihō Army — lone explosive expert plotting overthrow of the government.&quot; But felt that this alone did not give Tsunan &quot;interesting&quot; qualities, so he added the &quot;fake artist&quot; trait. Due to exhaustion and scheduling issues, the arc became three chapters instead of the planned four and Watsuki said some parts did not get fully developed as a result. The author expressed a desire to use Tsunan at a later point in the series since he is the sole character with a &quot;mass media&quot; connection and therefore could have further uses. Despite the fact that Tsunan is &quot;a little depressing,&quot; Watsuki likes Tsunan&#x27;s &quot;straightforward personality.&quot; Tsunan had no design model. Due to a lack of time Watsuki adapted an earlier concept of a man with dreadlocks, which &quot;to my surprise, turned out to be just right.&quot; After making some &quot;tweaks&quot; the design assembled &quot;quickly,&quot; with the bandanna and the &quot;oddly patterned&quot; jacket added to give him &quot;artist-y&quot; clothing.

===Mishima Eiji===

 is a young boy from Shingetsu village who wants to take revenge against Shishio&#x27;s forces for killing his brother and parents. Saitō Hajime sent Eiji&#x27;s brother to Shingetsu to investigate the incidents there, hoping that he would not raise suspicion; his cover was blown, and he failed to save his parents. Kenshin defeats Senkaku, Shishio&#x27;s man in charge of the village, and Shishio and his forces leave. Eiji tries to kill the unconscious Senkaku with a sword, but Saitō stops him so the police can question Senkaku. When Eiji insists that Senkaku needs to be killed for his family&#x27;s honor, Kenshin tells him that his dead family wants him to be happy, not for him to kill someone. Saitō arranges for his wife, Tokio (時尾), to care for Eiji in the near future. Watsuki created Eiji between the tragedy in Shingetsu village and the concept of a new beginning, and with the main theme of revenge. In retrospect, the author said that the plot pulled Eiji around and therefore could not develop as a character. Watsuki felt the design looked too similar to Yahiko.

===Sagara Sōzō===

, based on the historical figure of the same name, was the captain of the Sekihō Army&#x27;s first unit. As a child soldier underneath Sōzō, Sanosuke looked up to him greatly; hence he took Sōzō&#x27;s family name as his own and became Sagara Sanosuke. Supporters of the revolution, the Sekihō Army traveled the countryside spreading news about the upcoming change of regime, such as tax cuts. The Meiji government could not keep the promise and so used the Sekihō Army as scapegoats, denouncing them as a &quot;false army.&quot; Sōzō was decapitated when he reported to the commanding general and his head was placed on a platform in a cage for all to see, haunting Sanosuke for many years and causing his embitterment towards the Meiji government. In the anime, Sōzō died of fatal gunshot wounds while protecting Sanosuke.

Although a historical figure, Watsuki&#x27;s own mental image of Sagara Sōzō ended up taking precedence; according to the author, Sōzō genuinely wanted equality for Japan&#x27;s people. With him being depicted within the framework of Sanosuke&#x27;s memories, Sōzō ends up being glorified in the story. Watsuki debated whether to include the Sekihō Army Incident due to its obscurity. But because he believed that it exposed the truths and lies of the Meiji Restoration, he decided to include it. He did say that the series&#x27; popularity fell to its lowest point during this storyline, as of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; volume two, but repeated that leaving it out was not an option. With no actual historic photographs of Sōzō to use as a design, the character became popular &quot;in the eyes (and hearts) of female readers.&quot; Sagara came in sixth place in the series&#x27; first character popularity poll and eleventh in both the second and third.

===Arai Family===
The Arai Family consists of the blacksmith , his wife , and their infant son . Seikū&#x27;s father was the swordsmith who made Kenshin&#x27;s sakabatō. Kenshin seeks Shakkū out in Kyoto for a replacement and learns he is dead, but that his son is still alive and learned everything he knew. With his sakabatō broken, Kenshin asks Seikū to make a new sword, but Seikū refuses because he wants to live a peaceful life in the Meiji era and does not want to make anymore weapons. Wanting Shakkū&#x27;s final sword, Sawagejō Chō kidnaps Iori and uses him as a hostage until Azusa reveals that it was offered to the Hakusan Shrine as a &quot;godsword.&quot; With Kenshin about to lose to Chō without a sword, Seikū entrusts his father&#x27;s last sword to Kenshin, who immediately uses it to defeat Chō; to everyone&#x27;s surprise the sword is also a sakabatō.

Watsuki said that he had &quot;lots of different things in my mind&quot; when he created the family, but that he forgot many of them. He said that Iori symbolizes peace, Seikū demonstrates selfishness demonstrated by fathers, and Azusa &quot;uh... holds it all together?&quot; Iori&#x27;s design originated from &quot;a fairly famous women&#x27;s manga involving babies.&quot; Watsuki said that he created the father and mother &quot;on the spot.&quot; Watsuki felt that Seikū&#x27;s design in the end &quot;kind of&quot; looked similar to Takeda Kanryū, and so concluded that the design &quot;didn&#x27;t turn out quite right.&quot; But admitted that he also initially thought Azusa was &quot;not quite right&quot; until changing his mind, feeling &quot;she&#x27;s a really good character.&quot; The author added that he found it &quot;refreshing&quot; that Azusa is the first female character he designed who shows her entire forehead. Watsuki was planning to have Seikū&#x27;s family reappear later in the Kyoto arc with Yahiko as the lead character in the story. Iori tied with Jin-e for eighteenth place in the series&#x27; second character popularity poll.

===Higashidani Family===
Sanosuke&#x27;s father and younger siblings in Shinshū, who he left ten years before the series. His father, , is a farmer adept at fighting with his fists and who has fended off Fudōsawa from taking over the village. is his younger sister, and is his younger brother. Their mother, , died around two years after the birth of Ōta due to a cold. Uki became protective of her little brother because Sanosuke left them and because her mother died, so she was afraid of losing other family members. As a result, Ōta was sheltered. After learning about Sanosuke&#x27;s deeds Ōta becomes willing to fight. At the end of the series, Ōta&#x27;s name is listed as a student at Kaoru&#x27;s dojo.

Watsuki said that he always had some idea of what Sanosuke&#x27;s family would be like, and therefore formed the Higashidani family along those concepts. Kamishimoemon is what Sanosuke will be like when he is older, Uki is very &quot;lively&quot; and protective of others, and Ōta is the opposite of Sanosuke, a weak little boy. Watsuki felt that the story was a little unsatisfactory because he was tired from the previous storyline and therefore unable to concentrate. In retrospect, he said he should have chosen either Uki or Ōta and made it only a three-person family. However, the author said that illustrating the family was fun and that he liked challenging himself with a whole family. Watsuki had no models for the visual designs of the characters. Kamishimoemon originated from a concept of an aged Sanosuke that was considered for the final &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; chapter. He described Uki as just a &quot;modern, easy to draw type.&quot; Ōta is a &quot;typical Watsuki image&quot; of a weak child from a rural area who has cheeks with circle marks. Watsuki intended for designs that would be drawn quickly, but found it difficult and as they evolved he decided that he needed to study images of real people.

===Oguni Gensai===

 is the doctor who takes Megumi as his live-in assistant. In the anime he appears more often and has two grandchildren, and . In the Sony English dub the &quot;g&quot; in Gensai is pronounced as a &quot;soft&quot; g.

===Tani Jūsanrō===

 is a politician in the Army Ministry and a former member of the Ishin Shishi. Tani is wealthy, pompous and self-centered. Kurogasa marks him as an assassination target, but Kenshin and Sanosuke successfully defend Tani. Later in the series, Tani and Sanosuke get into an altercation; Tani, the uncle of Fudōsawa, supports his nephew taking over Sanosuke&#x27;s hometown. After Sanosuke defeats Fudōsawa and his army, he goes to Tani&#x27;s residence, defeating the Hiruma brothers, who act as Tani&#x27;s bodyguards, before injuring Tani.

==Minor characters==
:
:Based on the historical figure of the same name, is the general of the Japanese Army&#x27;s ground troops and former general of the Kiheitai. For the last ten years Yamagata has looked for his former comrade Kenshin. When he finally finds him he asks Kenshin to stop carrying a sword and join him and other former comrades, but is turned down. In the anime, he appears again as the assassination target of a corrupt politician, Takuma Hashizume, but thanks to Kenshin, he was saved and Hashizume was arrested. Later in the anime, he alerts Kenshin about an assassination attempt led by Ukyo Inagi. Yamagata also plays an important role in the anime&#x27;s Feng Shui arc assisting Kawaji and Tsunan with stopping the plot to destroy the Circle of Eternity. Watsuki said that he could not get his version of Yamagata to resemble surviving photographs of the real Yamagata. He is portrayed by Eiji Okuda in the live-action film.
:
:The master of the &quot;Chūetsu-ryū&quot; style. Kaoru occasionally trains/teaches at his dojo, which has increased the school&#x27;s enrollment numbers. Isurugi Raijūta appears at Maekawa&#x27;s dojo and defeats him in a match, but Kenshin prevents Raijūta from mortally wounding Maekawa and burning the dojo sign. However, it is stated that Maekawa was closing the dojo because of the loss. Later, Inui Banjin and Gein attack the dojo, but their bomb only partially destroys it thanks to Sanosuke. Maekawa does not blame Kenshin, but decides to retire and choose a young successor.
:
:The corrupt secretary of the senate who employs assassins to eliminate rivals in order to further his own career. He employs Udō Jin-e, Akamatsu Arundo, and Saitō Hajime.

:
:Based on the historical figure of the same name, was the leader of the Chōshū Ishin Shishi and one of the three great revolutionaries. He assigns Kenshin as a &quot;Hitokiri&quot; in Kyoto. Katsura later has Shishio Makoto succeed Kenshin as &quot;Hitokiri&quot; and moves Kenshin to the front lines in order to use him to protect the revolutionaries and the new era, instead of to destroy the old one. He is portrayed by Ichirōta Miyagawa in the first live-action film and Issey Takahashi in the fifth live-action film.
:
:Based on the historical figure of the same name, was the second in command of the Chōshū Ishin Shishi and founder of the Kiheitai, which initially recruited Kenshin.

===1996 anime-only characters===
====Shura====

 is the daughter of the former leader of the Kairyu Pirates, who were poor villagers dedicated to robbing only from the corrupted wealthy people. After her father&#x27;s death, she succeeded him in leader, and continued his legacy of robbing only the corrupt. During one raid, some pirates wanted to kidnap Kaoru but Shura did not accept that because of her belief that the Kairyu do not harm woman or children, so she took Kenshin to free Kaoru. Due to Shura&#x27;s strictness and honor-bound rules, along with the fact that she is a woman, she became very unpopular amongst the crew, with the exception of two, Sarujiro and Iwazo. As a result, the rest of them chose Ginjo, one member who allied with an opium dealer (Senbonya Yohei) they once robbed, as their new leader, and attempted to kill Shura in mutiny after adding firearms in their dealings. Shura returned, and with the help of Kenshin, defeated her wayward crew, and with Sarujiro and Iwazo, she left to the sea, as they were still criminals. Shura fought with a three-section staff that can disconnect into a chain-staff, and has great agility and reflexes. She might have developed feelings for Kenshin.

====Amakusa Shōgo====

, real name , was taught Hiten Mitsurugi by his uncle. Shogo is also a Christian, and sought revenge for Christianity, and to make the Holy Land, after his parents were killed for their beliefs, when Christians were persecuted during the Shogunate. He mastered &quot;God Speed&quot; by the age of 14, and according to Kenshin, had surpassed even God Speed. His followers believe that he is the &quot;Son of God&quot;. Some of his &quot;miracles&quot; were really just due to his education in Western Medicine, and other sciences.

====Lady Magdalia====

, real name , is Shogo Amakusa&#x27;s younger sister. She serves as a holy mother to their crowd of followers and a teacher to the young children. She has suffered from consumption ever since she was a child (which she perhaps obtained from her mother, who suffered the same illness). She is often seen accompanied by Shozo, a childhood friend whom she and her brother saved from persecution. Magdalia is a devout Christian and believes in everything that her brother says and does, which leads to her and Sanosuke Sagara having clashing personalities. Her most prized possession is her mother&#x27;s holy medallion which is lost and eventually returned to her by Sanosuke. She comes to respect him and wishes that she had met someone like him earlier in life so that she could have had a more open heart to those outside her faith. She is shot as she protects the Dutch consul, who can save her townspeople, and refuses to be treated in the hope that the people she cares for will be saved. She dies in Sanosuke&#x27;s arms after telling him her real name. Shogo promises to make her dreams of a land of equality and peace a reality.

<text>The brown booby (Sula leucogaster) is a large seabird of the booby family Sulidae, of which it is perhaps the most common and widespread species. It has a pantropical range, which overlaps with that of other booby species. The gregarious brown booby commutes and forages at low height over inshore waters. Flocks plunge-dive to take small fish, especially when these are driven near the surface by their predators. They nest only on the ground, and roost on solid objects rather than the water surface.

== Taxonomy ==
The brown booby was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; in 1781. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Buffon did not include a scientific name with his description but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus leucogaster&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality is Cayenne in French Guiana. The current genus &quot;Sula&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The word &quot;Sula&quot; is Norwegian for a gannet; the specific &quot;leucogaster&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;leuko&quot; for &quot;white&quot; and &quot;gastēr&quot; for &quot;belly&quot;. In 2024, the subspecies &quot;brewsteri&quot; and &quot;etesiaca&quot; were declared a distinct species by the name Cocos booby by the American Ornithological Society, Clements Checklist, and the IOC World Bird List.

There are two recognised subspecies:
* &quot;S. l. leucogaster&quot; – Caribbean and Atlantic Islands
* &quot;S. l. plotus&quot; – Red Sea through the Indian Ocean to the west and central Pacific
== Description ==
The booby&#x27;s head and upper body (back) is covered in dark brown to blackish plumage, with the remainder (belly) being a contrasting white. The bare-part colours vary geographically, but not seasonally. The species also displays sexual dimorphism of the bare part colours, the males having a blue orbital ring, as opposed to the yellow orbital ring of the female.

The female booby reaches about in length, their wingspan measures up to , and they can weigh up to . The male booby reaches about in length, their wingspan measures up to , and they can weigh up to .

Unlike other species of sulid, the juvenile plumage already resembles that of the adult. They are grey-brown with darkening on the head, upper surfaces of the wings and tail, while the lower breast and underpart plumages are heavily flecked brown on white. Juveniles of subspecies &quot;S. l. brewsteri&quot; are once again distinct in having the underpart plumage more evenly mouse brown.

Their beaks are quite sharp and contain many jagged edges. They have fairly short wings resulting in a fast flap rate, but long, tapered tails. While these birds are typically silent, bird watchers have reported occasional sounds similar to grunting or quacking.
== Ecology ==
This species breeds on islands and coasts in the pantropical areas of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They frequent the breeding grounds of the islands in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. With the rise in pollution in the world, brown boobies have been using marine debris to make their nests, with 90.1% of these nest were consisted of plastic, while nests near shipwreck have a high percentage of the wreckage debris. This bird nests in large colonies, laying two chalky blue eggs on the ground in a mound of broken shells and vegetation, but usually raises just one chick, the second one to hatch being unable to compete for food with its older sibling, or even ejected from the nest by it. It winters at sea over a wider area.

Brown booby pairs may remain together over several seasons. They perform elaborate greeting rituals, and are also spectacular divers, plunging into the ocean at high speed. They eat mainly small fish (such as flying fish, mullets, halfbeaks, anchovies, goatfish, crowned squirrelfish, and Indian mackerels), squids (including the family Ommastrephidae), or shrimps which gather in groups near the surface and may catch leaping fish while skimming the surface. Along with plunge-diving, some fledglings and adults practice kleptoparasitism, where they steal prey from other seabirds. For example: brown boobies have been observed stealing prey from great frigatebirds as they transfer food to their young. Although they are powerful and agile fliers, they are particularly clumsy in takeoffs and landings; they use strong winds and high perches to assist their takeoffs.

<text>Godsend is a 2004 psychological horror thriller film starring Greg Kinnear, Rebecca Romijn, and Robert De Niro, and directed by Nick Hamm from a screenplay by Mark Bomback. It follows a couple (Kinnear and Romijn) who are approached by an enigmatic doctor (De Niro) who offers to clone their deceased son. It received generally negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Paul and Jessie Duncan are a happily married couple who have an eight-year-old son named Adam. The day after his eighth birthday, when fetching a basketball into the street, Adam is killed in a collision. While leaving a church, Jessie and Paul are confronted by Dr. Richard Wells, an old professor of Jessie&#x27;s. He offers to clone Adam, an illegal procedure which would require a change of location and identity, to which the Duncans reluctantly agree. Everything appears to be fine with the new Adam until he reaches his eighth birthday. That night, he experiences a violent nightmare. Richard explains to Paul that it is typical for boys his age to have night terrors, and that it is not serious. He explains that because Adam II has reached the age at which the original Adam died, his life cannot be predicted anymore. From that moment on, Adam II continues to have night terrors until they become visions and he starts having them while he is wide awake, losing control of his actions.

Adam&#x27;s visions are recurrent: he witnesses a boy named Zachary walking around in a school building while being laughed at by other children. These images alternate with images of the school burning, and children screaming, and the image of an unidentified woman being attacked and killed with a hammer. Adam&#x27;s visions affect his daytime personality, making him bitter, delinquent, and uncooperative. Adam begins to bully another boy that goes to his school. One night at dinner, Jessie receives a telephone call from the parent of that child, distressed that her child is missing. Jessie tells Paul, who then asks what Adam was doing that day. Adam says that he was at the river playing. When Paul asks who he was playing with, Adam responds that he is &quot;not supposed to say&quot;. The next day, as the Duncans are driving on their way home over a bridge, they are slowed by a police officer. They walk to the side of the bridge to see the woman who had telephoned about her missing child the previous night, screaming at the sight of her son being retrieved by paramedics from a river where he had drowned. Paul believes Adam was involved with the child&#x27;s death.

With the help of Richard, Paul examines Adam and talks to him about his visions. He finally finds out that the school in Adam&#x27;s visions is called Saint Pius and that Zachary&#x27;s last name is Clark. With this information, Paul is able to track down the child&#x27;s address and find a former nanny of Zachary. The nanny informs Paul that Zachary was deeply disturbed. He was bullied at school tremendously, and in the wake of his emotions, set fire to the school. When he returned home Zachary killed his mother with a hammer before setting fire to their house, where he burned along with his mother’s body. When he asks the nanny, Paul learns that Zachary&#x27;s father was a geneticist—enough information to uncover that this man was none other than Richard Wells, living now under a false identity. Through the operation to clone Adam, Richard had secretly mixed Adam&#x27;s DNA with that of Zachary (as the fire damaged Zachary&#x27;s DNA to where it could not be cloned without the assistance of other living cells) with the hope of bringing his own son back to life, and then kidnapping him. The operation did not yield a complete success. After arguing with Richard and learning what has caused Adam&#x27;s erratic behavior, Paul races home. He finds Adam and Jessie in the shed in the woods. He has arrived just in time to stop Adam (with Zachary&#x27;s personality in control) from killing Jessie with a hammer, in nearly the same way as Zachary had killed his mother. Adam&#x27;s personality manages to regain control, and everything seems to be okay.

In an attempt to shake the psychological transitions from Adam to Zachary, the Duncans escape from Richard and move to a different neighborhood. All seems well. Adam is friendly and happy, but as he is left alone in his room, Adam hears a noise in the closet. When he opens the closet door, a slightly burnt and decayed arm wearing Zachary’s jersey, reaches out from the darkness of the closet and pulls Adam in. Paul comes back to check on Adam and looks in the closet, but he does not see anyone. Adam then appears from behind and shocks Paul by touching him, indicating that Zachary has regained control.

===Marketing===

As a part of the film&#x27;s promotional campaign, Lions Gate set up a website for the fictional Godsend Institute in the film, which claimed to be able to resurrect the dead. Lions Gate changed the website to inform people that it was only an advertisement, due to the large number of inquiries asking if they really resurrect dead family members.

<text>Thomas Reginald Handley (17 January 1892 – 9 January 1949) was an English comedian, best known for the BBC radio programme &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; (&quot;ITMA&quot;) which ran between 1939 and 1949.

Born in Liverpool, Lancashire, Handley went on the stage in his teens and after military service in the First World War he established himself as a comedian and singer on the music hall circuit. He became nationally known as a pioneer broadcaster. From 1924 onwards he was frequently heard on BBC variety programmes as a solo entertainer and an actor in sketches. In the 1930s Handley frequently performed on air with the comedian Ronald Frankau in a popular comedy act as &quot;Mr Murgatroyd and Mr Winterbottom&quot;.

Handley&#x27;s greatest success came in 1939 with the BBC radio comedy show &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot;, which, after an uncertain start, caught the British public&#x27;s imagination and reached an unprecedentedly large audience. He starred as the good-natured, fast-talking anchor-man around whom a cast of eccentric comic characters revolved. The show was credited for its important part in keeping up morale in Britain during the Second World War.

Handley died suddenly in 1949, and &quot;ITMA&quot; died with him.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Handley was born at Toxteth Park, Liverpool, on 17 January 1892, the son of John Handley and his wife, Sarah Ann, &quot;née&quot; Pearson. John Handley, who is believed to have run a dairy business, died while Tommy was a baby. After leaving school Handley earned his living as a salesman, but developed a reputation as an amateur singer. He was determined to go into show business and became a professional singer in 1916. He toured briefly in the operetta &quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot;, before being called up in 1917 into the Royal Naval Air Service. During the last two years of the First World War, he served in a kite balloon section and subsequently in a concert party entertaining the troops.

After the war, Handley auditioned for the impresario Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte, and impressed him with his performance of the Major-General&#x27;s patter song from &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. Carte wrote to offer him a place in a new D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring company, but by the time the invitation arrived Handley was contractually committed elsewhere. He toured in musical comedy and in the music halls as a comedian and singer. He became known in the leading role of the officer in the sketch &quot;The Disorderly Room&quot;, a parody of military life, written by Eric Blore, in which military disciplinary proceedings were comically set to popular tunes of the day. The sketch remained in his repertory from 1921 to 1941, and according to Handley&#x27;s biographer Ted Kavanagh &quot;it must have been played on every music-hall stage in the country&quot;. In 1924 &quot;The Disorderly Room&quot; was included in the programme for the Royal Command Performance at the London Coliseum. The show was broadcast, and marked the beginning of Handley&#x27;s radio career.

===BBC===
Handley was successful on the halls, but he was not a major star. His career took off as a broadcaster. He was a regular performer on the BBC from 1924 onwards – his biographer Barry Took calls him &quot;a mainstay of its variety programmes&quot; – as a solo entertainer, an actor in sketches and occasionally a producer. Much of his material was written by Ted Kavanagh, who devised comic monologues for him and worked with him on the broadcast revues that paved the way for their greatest success, &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot;.

In 1929 Handley married the actress and singer Jean Allistone (Rosalind Jean Henshall, &quot;née&quot; Allistone, 1897–1958) whom he had met at the BBC. She had trained under Sir Herbert Tree, appeared in revues and musical comedies and, from 1925, was a pioneer broadcaster. The couple had no children.

Between 1935 and 1949 Handley frequently performed on air with the comedian Ronald Frankau in a comedy act as &quot;Mr Murgatroyd and Mr Winterbottom&quot; (&quot;Two minds with not a single thought&quot;). Together they wrote and delivered what Took describes as &quot;a sophisticated crosstalk of quickfire word and idea association&quot;; the combination of the Old Etonian Frankau&#x27;s patrician tones as Murgatroyd and Handley&#x27;s fast-talking Scouse patter as Winterbottom became one of the BBC&#x27;s most popular comedy features. Took quotes a typical example of Murgatroyd and Winterbottom&#x27;s rapid cross-talk, which concludes:
:Murgatroyd: Yes, Mr Winterbottom, we must always study the listener – the Mr and Mrs Everymans
:Winterbottom: The Jones and Smiths.
:Murgatroyd: The Robinsons and Browns.
:Winterbottom: The Gilbert and Sullivans.
:Murgatroyd: The Tristan and Isoldes.
:Winterbottom: The Hengists and Horsas.
:Murgatroyd: The Moodys and Sankeys.
:Winterbottom: And the Darbys and Joans.
:Murgatroyd: Cut out the Joans and let&#x27;s think of the Derby. What have you backed?
:Winterbottom: My car into a shop window. Joan a car?
:Murgatroyd: Cut out the Joan and let&#x27;s think of the Derby again.
Murgatroyd and Winterbottom became so popular that the performers&#x27; wives – Jean Allistone and Renee Roberts – were invited to make several broadcasts of their own as &quot;Mrs Murgatroyd and Mrs Winterbottom&quot;.

===&quot;ITMA&quot;===
Towards the end of the 1930s Handley and Kavanagh were, in Took&#x27;s words, &quot;at a crossroads&quot;, in need of &quot;a new direction in which to move and a new stimulus to drive them forward&quot;. The new direction and stimulus came with the BBC&#x27;s need for a replacement for &quot;Band Waggon&quot;, an immensely successful hour-long variety programme starring Arthur Askey and Richard Murdoch. Askey&#x27;s career was developing elsewhere, on stage and screen, and the 1939 run of the show was its last. Kavanagh and Handley, together with the BBC producer Francis Worsley, conceived a successor. Instead of the one-off sketches to which Handley and Kavanagh were accustomed, the new show would be 45 minutes in length. The three colleagues agreed to set the series on a pirate radio ship, with Handley in charge, surrounded by and coping with a cast of miscellaneous oddballs. The title was &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; – a phrase borrowed from &quot;The Daily Express&quot; which used it as a headline for an article about Adolf Hitler. The series was launched in July 1939, but made little impression before its initial run came to an end shortly before the Second World War started.

At the outbreak of the war the BBC, knowing that its London headquarters at Broadcasting House would be a principal target for enemy bombing, put into effect plans to move much of its activity to other locations. Many of the corporation&#x27;s programmes were broadcast from places such as Bristol and Weston-super-Mare in the West Country and Evesham and Bedford in the Midlands. The BBC Variety department was moved first to Bristol and, in 1941, to Bangor in North Wales. &quot;ITMA&quot; resumed, its running time reduced to 30 minutes, and now Handley and his colleagues caught the public mood with shows that genially satirised many of the irritating features of wartime existence and generated catchphrases that became common currency. Handley was cast as the Minister of Aggravation and Mysteries at the Office of Twerps, surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters; they included, at various times, the bibulous Colonel Chinstrap, the morose Mona Lott, the incompetent German spy Funf, the formidable charlady Mrs Mopp, the dubious vendor Ali Oop, and the ultra-polite broker&#x27;s men Claude and Cecil. The supposed locale and the cast of characters changed over the years, but the formula – Handley as the benign master of ceremonies beset by a gallery of comic eccentrics – remained constant.

&quot;ITMA&quot; became an enormous success, popular with all classes of society. By the middle of the war, an unprecedented forty per cent of the British population was tuning in to &quot;ITMA&quot;. It had the distinction of becoming the first radio show to give a royal command performance: early in 1942 a special edition of &quot;ITMA&quot; was performed at Windsor Castle for Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s birthday. In between seasons on air, Handley and his colleagues took &quot;ITMA&quot; on tour in live shows round the country.

The last edition of &quot;ITMA&quot; – the 310th – was recorded on 5 January 1949; four days later Handley died suddenly of a cerebral haemorrhage. His death was announced on air by the Director General of the BBC, Sir William Haley, who insisted on making the announcement himself. The King and Queen sent a message of sympathy to Handley&#x27;s widow. Thousands of people lined the route of Handley&#x27;s funeral procession from the chapel near his London home to Golders Green Crematorium, and packed memorial services were held in two cathedrals: St Paul&#x27;s on 27 January and Liverpool three days later.

==Reputation==
Handley and the &quot;ITMA&quot; team were widely credited with boosting morale during the war, and were unmissable listening for millions. A member of the Royal Household said that if the war were to end between 8.30 and 9 p.m. on a Thursday night none of the household would dare to tell the King until &quot;ITMA&quot; had finished. Although Handley was a leading star in Britain, his material in &quot;ITMA&quot; was so topical and local, and delivered at such speed, that it was incomprehensible to many outside the UK. Nonetheless, it was popular in Australia: a writer in &quot;The Age&quot; commented that Handley&#x27;s &quot;roguish Liverpudlian twang could have made a stock-exchange report sound funny&quot;. A Canadian newspaper quoted an American who heard the show: &quot;I can&#x27;t understand a word the guy is saying, but it sure sounds like great radio&quot;. It was said that Bob Hope, though British-born, found &quot;ITMA&quot; &quot;too fast&quot; for him.

Haley said of Handley, &quot;He was not only broadcasting&#x27;s greatest but also its most natural comedian. … He was a true original [and] there will never be anyone quite like That Man again&quot;. In Took&#x27;s words:

<text>Chunga&#x27;s Revenge is the third solo album, and eleventh album counting the work of his band The Mothers of Invention, by Frank Zappa, released on October 23, 1970. Zappa&#x27;s first effort of the 1970s marks the first appearance of former Turtles members Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan - nicknamed Flo &amp; Eddie - on a Zappa record, and signals the dawn of a controversial epoch in Zappa&#x27;s history. &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot; represents a shift from both the satirical political commentary of his 1960s work with The Mothers of Invention, and the jazz fusion of &quot;Hot Rats&quot;.

The material presented on &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot; is eclectic: side one includes a guitar jam (&quot;Transylvania Boogie&quot;), a bluesy amble (&quot;Road Ladies&quot;), a jazz interlude (&quot;Twenty Small Cigars&quot;) and an avant garde live improvisation (&quot;The Nancy and Mary Music&quot;) drawn from &quot;King Kong&quot; from a July 1970 Mothers performance, released officially on Road Tapes, Venue 3. Several poppy numbers (&quot;Tell Me You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Would You Go All the Way?&quot;, &quot;Rudy Wants to Buy Yez a Drink&quot;, &quot;Sharleena&quot;) appear on the second side along with the improvisational title track and a percussion-only track (&quot;The Clap&quot;).

&quot;Twenty Small Cigars&quot; was drawn from the &quot;Hot Rats&quot; sessions from summer 1969. &quot;Transylvania Boogie&quot; and &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot; come from the early 1970 period where Zappa performed with a band informally known as &quot;Hot Rats,&quot; including Ian Underwood, Don &quot;Sugarcane&quot; Harris, Max Bennett and Aynsley Dunbar. Also from this period is &quot;The Clap,&quot; a short multitracked percussion piece with Zappa as the only musician. The vocal tracks all deal with the subject of sex and/or groupie encounters and as Zappa notes on the sleeve of both the vinyl and CD, are a preview of the then forthcoming &quot;200 Motels&quot; film/album, and date from the summer of 1970 after the formation of the new Mothers of Invention lineup.

The original early 1970 version of &quot;Sharleena&quot; later appeared on &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot;. In June 2023, Zappa Record/Ume released &quot;Funky Nothingness,&quot; an archival release drawn almost entirely from the early 1970 sessions, which also included this version of &quot;Sharleena&quot; as well as the unreleased instrumental &quot;Twinkle Tits&quot; that had appeared in a live concert recording from this era, and unedited takes of &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge,&quot; &quot;Transylvania Boogie&quot; and &quot;The Clap.&quot;

Another &quot;lost&quot; track from this era, &quot;Bognor Regis,&quot; was recorded in summer 1969 and intended to be released as a B-side of &quot;Sharleena&quot;, but the single was never released, and the track was leaked to the public on an acetate disc copy which made its way to the collector&#x27;s market. &quot;Bognor Regis&quot; was later included along with &quot;Twenty Small Cigars&quot; in the archival release &quot;The Hot Rats Sessions.&quot;

The title track was later recorded by Argentinian/Parisian tango revival group Gotan Project for their 2001 debut album &quot;La Revancha del Tango&quot;.

The guitar melody in &quot;Tell Me You Love Me&quot; is extremely similar to the one used in &quot;Bwana Dik&quot; and &quot;Daddy, Daddy, Daddy&quot;, during the &quot;if his dick is a monster&quot; section, from &quot;Fillmore East - June 1971&quot;, and &quot;200 Motels&quot;, respectively. Zappa would include a 1980 live version of the song on &quot;Tinsel Town Rebellion&quot;, while a 1988 version with revised lyrics titled &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Like Me&quot; appeared on &quot;Broadway the Hard Way&quot;. (A similar version from 1984, known as &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Lawyer,&quot; has never been officially released.) Zappa would also include an 80&#x27;s recording of &quot;Sharleena&quot; on &quot;Them or Us&quot;, while a 1988 version of &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot; where Zappa played alongside his son Dweezil was the opening track of the album &quot;Trance-Fusion&quot; which Zappa compiled in the 90&#x27;s (although it would not be released until 2006).

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review in the leading French music magazine, &quot;Rock &amp; Folk&quot;, Paul Alessandrini praises the album: &quot;The richness, the musical intelligence of Zappa confirm once more his distinctive sound which is a &#x27;chemical&#x27; synthesis of different styles. In the centre are the blues but also the rock&#x27;n roll of the fifties, always with satirical lyrics. This album is maybe less demanding that the last one, the utterly unique &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;, but Zappa confirms himself now as solid, mature and aware of his creative skills. Supported by the multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood, he shows himself an all-round guitarist, versatile at all kinds of tempos and inventive with the wah-wah pedal.&quot;

In his 1994 book on Zappa, Ben Watson elaborates this point: &quot; &#x27;Transsylvanian Boogie&#x27; provides a vampire vamp for some of Zappa&#x27;s most Eastern-sounding guitar. The title referred to the homeland of (...) Bela Bartok. (...) Bartok provides a crucial model for composers seeking to break out of the limitations of the Western tradition. The complex time-signature and Dunbar&#x27;s shimmering cymbals are exotically bohemian, though there is a distinctly sci-fi flavour to Zappa&#x27;s wah-wah guitar sound. The mid-section has him plucking irrational runs with some of Conlon Nancarrow&#x27;s delirium: he builds to a peak note and then moves to an irresistible boogie, Underwood&#x27;s organ grooving behind him, Dunbar contributing a new fluency.&quot;

However, this development was not to the liking of more tradition-orientated commentators. Reviewing &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Like Bobby Sherman, Zappa is a selfish exploiter of popular taste. That Bobby Sherman wants to make money while Zappa wants to make money and emulate Varese is beside the point—if anything, Zappa&#x27;s aestheticism intensifies his contempt for rock and its audience. Even &quot;Hot Rats&quot;, his compositional peak, played as much with the moods and usages of Muzak as with those of rock and roll. This is definitely not his peak. Zappa plays a lot of guitar, just as his admirers always hope he will, but the overall effect is more Martin Denny than Varese. Also featured are a number of &#x27;dirty&#x27; jokes.&quot;

<doc id="1033489" wikidata="Q131263" url="?curid=1033489" title="Barracks">
<text>Barracks are buildings used to accommodate military personnel and quasi-military personnel such as police. The English word originates from the 17th century via French and Italian from an old Spanish word &#x27;soldier&#x27;s tent&#x27;, but today barracks are usually permanent buildings. The word may apply to separate housing blocks or to complete complexes, and the plural form often refers to a single structure and may be singular in construction.

The main objective of barracks is to separate soldiers from the civilian population and reinforce discipline, training, and &quot;esprit de corps&quot;. They have been called &quot;discipline factories for soldiers&quot;. Like industrial factories, some are considered to be shoddy or dull buildings, although others are known for their magnificent architecture such as Collins Barracks in Dublin and others in Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Vienna, or London. From the rough barracks of 19th-century conscript armies, filled with hazing and illness and barely differentiated from the livestock pens that housed the draft animals, to the clean and Internet-connected barracks of modern all-volunteer militaries, the word can have a variety of connotations.

==History==







Early barracks such as those of the Roman Praetorian Guard were built to maintain elite forces. There are a number of remains of Roman army barracks in frontier forts such as Vercovicium and Vindolanda. From these and from contemporary Roman sources we can see that the basics of life in a military camp have remained constant for thousands of years. 
In the Early Modern Period, they formed part of the Military Revolution that scholars believe contributed decisively to the formation of the nation state by increasing the expense of maintaining standing armies. Large, permanent barracks were developed in the 18th century by the two dominant states of the period, France the &quot;caserne&quot; and Spain the &quot;cuartel&quot;. The English term &#x27;barrack&#x27;, on the other hand, derives from the Spanish word for a temporary shelter erected by soldiers on campaign, &quot;barraca&quot;; (because of fears that a standing army in barracks would be a threat to the constitution, barracks were not generally built in Great Britain until 1790, on the eve of the Napoleonic Wars).

Early barracks were multi-story blocks, often grouped in a quadrangle around a courtyard or parade ground. A good example is Berwick Barracks, which was among the first in England to be purpose-built and begun in 1717 to the design of the distinguished architect Nicholas Hawksmoor. During the 18th century, the increasing sophistication of military life led to separate housing for different ranks (officers always had larger rooms) and married quarters; as well as the provision of specialized buildings such as dining rooms and cook houses, bath houses, mess rooms, schools, hospitals, armories, gymnasia, riding schools and stables. The pavilion plan concept of hospital design was influential in barrack planning after the Crimean War.

The first large-scale training camps were built in the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire (Germany) during the early 18th century. The British Army built Aldershot camps from 1854.

By the First World War, infantry, artillery, and cavalry regiments had separate barracks. The first naval barracks were hulks, old wooden sailing vessels; but these insanitary lodgings were replaced with large naval barracks at the major dockyard towns of Europe and the United States, usually with hammocks instead of beds.

These were inadequate for the enormous armies mobilized after 1914. Hut camps were developed using variations of the eponymous Nissen hut, made from timber or corrugated iron.

==Military==
In many military forces, both NCO and SNCO personnel will frequently be housed in barracks for service or training. Officers are often charged with ensuring the barracks and personnel are maintained in an orderly fashion. Junior enlisted and sometimes junior NCOs will often receive less space and may be housed in bays, while senior NCOs and officers may share or have their own room. Junior enlisted personnel are typically tasked with the cleanliness of the barracks. 
The term &quot;Garrison town&quot; is a common expression for any town that has military barracks, i.e., a permanent military presence nearby.

===Prison===
Prison cell blocks often are built and arranged like barracks, and some military prisons may have &quot;barracks&quot; in their name, such as the United States Disciplinary Barracks of Leavenworth.

==Worldwide==

===Canada===
Barracks were used to house troops in forts during the Upper Canadian period. Leading up to and during the War of 1812, Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe and Major-General Isaac Brock oversaw the construction of Fort York on the shores of Lake Ontario in present-day Toronto. There are several surviving British Army barracks built between 1814 and 1815 at that site today. Multiple limestone barracks were built half a mile west of Fort York in 1840, only one of which survives. The British Army handed over &quot;New Fort York&quot;, as the second fort was called, to the Canadian Militia in 1870 after Confederation.

The Stone Frigate, completed in 1820, served as barracks briefly in 1837–38, and was refitted as a dormitory and classrooms to house the Royal Military College of Canada by 1876. The Stone frigate is a large stone building originally designed to hold gear and rigging from British warships dismantled to comply with the Rush–Bagot Treaty.

===Poland===
In Poland barracks are represented usually as a complex of buildings, each consisting of a separate entity or an administrative or business premises. As an example, the Barracks Complex in Września.

===Portugal===
Each of the Portuguese Army bases is referred as a &quot;quartel&quot; (barracks). In a barracks, each of the dormitory buildings is referred as a &quot;caserna&quot; (casern). Most of them are regimental barracks, constituting the fixed component of the Army system of forces and being responsible for the training, sustenance and general support to the Army. In addition to the regimental administrative, logistic and training bodies, each barracks can lodge one or more operational units (operational battalions, independent companies or equivalent units). Although there are housing blocks within the perimeter of some regimental barracks, the Portuguese usual practice is for the members of the Armed Forces to live outside the military bases with their families, inserted in the local civilian communities.

Many of the Portuguese regimental barracks are of a model developed by the old Administrative Commission for the New Infrastructures of the Armed Forces (CANIFA). Because of this, they are commonly referred as &quot;CANIFA type barracks&quot;. These types of barracks were built in the 1950s and 1960s, following a standardized architectural model, usually with an area of between 100,000 and 200,000 square metres, including a headquarters building, a guard house, a general mess building, an infirmary building, a workshop and garage building, an officer house building, a sergeant house building, three to ten rank and file caserns, fire ranges and sports facilities. In average each CANIFA type barracks was intended to lodge around 1000 soldiers and their respective armament, vehicles and other equipment.

===Russia===
Until the end of the 18th century personnel of the Imperial Russian Army were billeted with civilians homes or accommodated in slobodas in a countryside. First barracks were built during the reign of Emperor Paul I. For these purposes, Paul I established a one-time land tax based on the amount of land owned by citizen. This tax was not mandatory, but person who paid it was permanently exempted from billets.

From the end of 1882, the money collected for exemption from billet was transferred to the military ministry. This has made it possible to step up the construction of barracks for the army. By 1 January 1900, 19,015 barracks had been built, which accommodated 94% of the troops.

===United Kingdom===
In the 17th and 18th centuries there were concerns around the idea of a standing army housed in barracks; instead, the law provided for troops routinely to be billeted in small groups in inns and other locations. (The concerns were various: political, ideological and constitutional, provoked by memories of Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army and of the use of troops in reign of James II to intimidate areas of civil society. Furthermore, grand urban barracks were associated with absolutist monarchies, where they could be seen as emblematic of power sustained through military might; and there was an ongoing suspicion that gathering soldiers together in barracks might encourage sedition.)

Nevertheless, some &quot;soldiers&#x27; lodgings&quot; were built in Britain at this time, usually attached to coastal fortifications or royal palaces. The first recorded use of the word &#x27;barracks&#x27; in this context was for the Irish Barracks, built in the precinct of the Tower of London in 1669. At the Ordnance Office (responsible for construction and upkeep of barracks) Bernard de Gomme played a key role in developing a &#x27;domestic&#x27; style of barrack design in the latter half of the 17th century: he provided barrack blocks for such locations as Plymouth Citadel and Tilbury Fort, each with rows of square rooms arranged in pairs on two stories, accommodating a Company of some sixty men, four to a room, two to a bed. Standard furnishings were provided, and each room had a grate used for heating and cooking.

In England, this domestic style continued to be used through the first half of the eighteenth century; most new barracks of this period were more or less hidden within the precincts of medieval castles and Henrician forts. In Scotland, however, a more demonstrative style was employed following the Jacobite rising of 1715 (as at Ruthven Barracks) and that of 1745 (as seen in the monumental Fort George). This bolder approach gradually began to be adopted south of the border during the eighteenth century (beginning with nearby Berwick, 1717). There was much building in and around the Royal Dockyards at this time: during the Seven Years&#x27; War, fears of a land attack led to defensive &#x27;lines&#x27; being built around the dockyard towns, and infantry barracks were established within them (e.g. at Chatham, Upper and Lower Barracks, 1756, and Plymouth, six defensible square barracks, 1758–63). The newly constituted Royal Marines were also provided with accommodation in the vicinity of the Dockyards (e.g. Stonehouse Barracks, 1779) becoming the first Corps in Britain to be fully provided with its own accommodation. Large urban barracks were still a rarity, though. In London there was a fair amount of barrack accommodation, but most of it was within the precincts of various royal palaces (as at Horse Guards, 1753). The prominent Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich (1776) was one exception (but significantly the Artillery were under the command of the Board of Ordnance rather than of the Army).

In the aftermath of the French Revolution, though, things changed. The size of the army grew from 40,000 to 225,000 between 1790 and 1814 (with the Militia adding a further 100,000). Barrack accommodation at the time was provided for a mere 20,000. To deal with the situation, responsibility for building barracks was transferred in 1792 from the Board of Ordnance to a specialist Barracks Department overseen by the War Office. With a view to dealing with sedition, and perhaps quelling thoughts of revolution, several large cavalry barracks were built in the 1790s: first at Knightsbridge (close to the royal palaces), then in several provincial towns and cities: Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester, Norwich, Nottingham and Sheffield (as well as Hounslow Barracks just west of London). Several smaller cavalry and artillery barracks were established around this time, but very little was built for the infantry; instead, a number of large camps (with wooden huts) were set up, including at Chelmsford, Colchester and Sunderland, as well as at various locations along the south coast. Barrack-masters were appointed, one such was Captain George Manby at the Royal Barracks, Great Yarmouth. Coincidentally his father, Captain Matthew Manby, had been barrack-master at Limerick.

It was not until some years after the end of the Napoleonic Wars (and post-war recession) that barrack-building began again. John Nash built four as part of his London improvements: Regent&#x27;s Park and St John&#x27;s Wood for the Cavalry, Wellington Barracks for the Guards, and St George&#x27;s Barracks (since demolished) behind the National Gallery. In several instances elsewhere, buildings were converted rather than newly built (or a mixture of the two, as at Cambridge Barracks, Portsmouth where a new frontage, housing officers, was built in front of a range of warehouses converted to house the men). In response to the Chartist riots three barracks were established in north-west England in the 1840s, Ladysmith Barracks at Ashton-under-Lyne, Wellington Barracks at Bury and Fulwood Barracks at Preston.

A review conducted following the demise of the Board of Ordnance in 1855 noted that only seven barracks outside London had accommodation for more than 1,000. This changed with the establishment of large-scale Army Camps such as Aldershot (1854), and the expansion of Garrison towns such as Colchester; over time in these locations temporary huts were replaced with more permanent barracks buildings. Large-scale camps were not the only way forward, however; from the 1870s, the localisation agenda of the Cardwell Reforms saw new and old barracks established as depots for regional or County brigades and regiments. The latter part of the 19th century also saw the establishment of a number of Naval barracks (an innovation long resisted by the Royal Navy, which had tended to accommodate its sailors afloat either on their ships or else in hulks moored in its harbours). The first of these, Keyham Barracks in Devonport (later HMS Drake), was begun in 1879, and only completed in 1907.

During the 20th century, activity ranged from the need for speedy expansion during the First World War (when large camps such as Catterick were established), to the closure of many barracks in the interwar period. Many of those that remained were rebuilt in the 1960s, either substantially (as happened at Woolwich, behind the facade) or entirely (as at Hyde Park and at Chelsea – built 1863, demolished and rebuilt 1963, closed 2008). There has been an ongoing focus on improving the quality of barracks accommodation; since the 1970s several former RAF bases have been converted to serve as Army barracks, in place of some of the more cramped urban sites. Today, generally, only single and unmarried personnel or those who choose not to move their families nearby live in barracks. Most British military barracks are named after battles, military figures or the locality.

===United States===
In basic training, and sometimes follow-on training, service members live in barracks. Formerly, the U.S. Marine Corps had gender-separate basic training units. Currently, all services have training where male and female recruits share barracks, but are separated during personal time and lights out. All the services integrate male and female members following boot camp and first assignment.

After training, unmarried junior enlisted members will typically reside in barracks. During unaccompanied, dependent-restricted assignments, non-commissioned and commissioned officer ranks may also be required to live in barracks. Amenities in these barracks increase with the rank of the occupant.

Unlike the other services, the U.S. Air Force officially uses the term &quot;dormitory&quot; to refer to its unaccompanied housing.

During World War II, many U.S. barracks were made of inexpensive, sturdy and easy to assemble Quonset huts that resembled Native American long houses (having a rounded roof but made out of metal).

<doc id="1033500" wikidata="Q288958" url="?curid=1033500" title="Operation Wolf">
<text>is a light gun shooter arcade game developed by Taito and released in 1987. It was ported to many home systems.

The game was critically and commercially successful, becoming one of the highest-grossing arcade games of 1988 and winning the Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year. &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; popularized military-themed first-person light gun rail shooters and inspired numerous clones, imitators, and others in the genre over the next decade. It spawned four sequels: &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; (1988), &quot;Operation Wolf 3&quot; (1994), &quot;Operation Tiger&quot; (オペレーションタイガー) (1998), and &quot;Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission&quot; (2023).

==Gameplay==
Assuming the role of Special Forces Operative Roy Adams, the player attempts to rescue five hostages who are being held captive in enemy territory. The game is viewed from a first-person perspective, and is on rails, with the screen scrolling horizontally through the landscape. The game has six stages to advance the story. For example, after the jungle stage is completed, Adams interrogates an enemy soldier and learns the location of the concentration camp and hostages. Each stage has unique objectives and effects on gameplay after completion, all based on rescuing hostages. Game over screens vary depending on situations, such as the player&#x27;s death or failure to rescue a single hostage. Continuing the game restarts the stage. The Nintendo Entertainment System version has multiple endings depending on the number of rescued hostages.

The arcade cabinet has an optical controller resembling an Uzi submachine gun which the player can swivel and elevate, and which vibrates to simulate recoil of gunfire. Pulling the trigger allows fully automatic fire, and pressing the button near the muzzle launches a grenade with a wide blast radius against multiple targets.

To complete each stage, the player must shoot a required number of soldiers and vehicles (trucks, boats, helicopters, armored transports), as indicated by an on-screen counter. The limited ammunition and grenades can be replenished by shooting objects. Shooting dynamite bombs causes heavy damage to every target on the screen, both enemy and friendly, and a special machine gun power-up allows unlimited ammunition and an increased rate of fire for 10 seconds.

Enemies attack with gunfire, knives, grenades, mortar and bazooka rounds, and missiles; all their visible incoming projectiles can be shot out of the air. The player has a damage bar that slowly fills due to enemy attacks or shooting friendly targets such as nurses and boys. Damage can be recovered by collecting health power-ups and completing stages.

==Home conversions==

The game was converted to the Amstrad CPC, DOS, NES, Amiga 500, Atari ST, Master System, FM Towns, Commodore 64, PC Engine, and ZX Spectrum. Most lack light gun support (except NES and Master System) and must be played with a keyboard or a controller. In 1989, a special ZX Spectrum version with Magnum Light Phaser support was produced for inclusion in Amstrad&#x27;s ZX Spectrum +2 and +3 Action Pack hardware bundles. The box for the Master System version features promotional art from &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot;.

In 2005, &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; was released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Windows within &quot;Taito Legends&quot; without light gun support. The NES version was released on the North American Wii Virtual Console in February 2008 without light gun support.

==Reception==
===Commercial performance===
The game was commercially successful. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; in its December 1, 1987 issue as the second most-successful upright or cockpit arcade cabinet of the month, and it went on to become the second highest-grossing arcade game of 1988 (below Sega&#x27;s &quot;After Burner&quot; and &quot;After Burner II&quot;). In Europe, &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; debuted as the top-grossing arcade game of October 1987 in the United Kingdom, and again topped the charts in December 1987; it held the top spot through March 1988, and remained in the top five through July, when it was number four on the &quot;Coinslot&quot; dedicated arcade game chart (below &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Continental Circus&quot;, and &quot;WEC Le Mans&quot;). &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; went on to become the top-earning arcade game of 1988 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; was one of the top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1988.

The home computer conversions topped the UK sales charts in late 1988 until it was replaced by &quot;RoboCop&quot; which held the number one position for most of 1989.

===Critical response===
Upon release in arcades, the game received wide acclaim from critics, particularly for its gameplay, graphics, and controls. Its violence was criticized, particularly in the UK press following the Hungerford massacre that had occurred a few months before its release. &quot;Commodore User&quot; said it beats Sega&#x27;s &quot;After Burner&quot; as &quot;the game of the year and much of next year too&quot; but that it may draw some controversy from tabloids for its &quot;Rambo&quot;-like violent content. Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called it one of the best new releases, stating that, though excessively violent, it was an &quot;extremely playable&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot; fast-paced action game. &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; called it a &quot;fast and furious&quot; action game, and said it &quot;broke a bit of new &#x27;ground&#x27; for arcade games &#x27;cos the &#x27;nasties&#x27; fired directly at you through the screen&quot;.

The home computer conversions also received positive reviews. &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; gave the ZX Spectrum conversion a highly positive review. The NES version received more mixed reviews. In &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s review of the NES conversion, three critics scored it 6/10, one 8/10.

===Accolades===
&quot;Sinclair User&quot; gave the arcade game the &quot;Over The Top Game of 1988&quot; award, for the &quot;shooting game most likely to push you over the edge&quot; in 1988. The home computer conversions won several awards at the 1989 Golden Joystick Awards for 1988, including overall Game of the Year (8-bit), Best Coin-Op Conversion (8-bit), and Best Coin-Op Conversion (16-bit). It was later voted number 26 in the &quot;&quot;Your Sinclair&quot; Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; poll. &quot;Crash&quot; awarded it a Crash Smash. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; awarded it a CVG Hit.

==Legacy==
&quot;Operation Wolf&quot; had long-term influence on the market upon its release. It is credited with evolving the light gun shooter genre. It departed from the shooting gallery, carnival, and cartoon themes that had previously dominated the genre for decades, from electro-mechanical games in the 1960s until Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; in 1984, and moved the genre toward more realistic, violent, and military shooter themes. In contrast to Taito&#x27;s earlier gun games including &quot;Attack&quot; (1976), &quot;N.Y. Captor&quot; (1985), and &quot;Cycle Shooting&quot; (1986) which have simple cartoon graphics, &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; has more realistic graphics. This provides a depth of perspective by using different sized sprites.

&quot;Operation Wolf&quot; took the military themes of 1980s run and gun video games (such as &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Green Beret&quot;, and &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;) and action films (such as &quot;Rambo&quot; and &quot;Commando&quot;) and applied them to light gun shooters. It presents a novel light gun shooter basis for the prisoner of war (POW) rescue mission with massive violence, killing masses of enemy soldiers. It innovates on the mounted gun mechanism - used before in Taito&#x27;s &quot;Attack&quot; and even older Midway mechanical games from the 1960s - by using an optical sensor and a physical sensation of gunfire. It spawned many arcade shooters with mounted machine gun controls and increasing levels of violence during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Den of Geek cited it as a precursor to the then emerging first-person shooter genre.

The game popularized first-person light gun rail shooters and inspired numerous clones and imitators during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Examples include SNK&#x27;s &quot;Mechanized Attack&quot; and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Line of Fire&quot; in 1989, SNK&#x27;s &quot;Beast Busters&quot; in 1990, Namco&#x27;s &quot;Steel Gunner&quot; and Midway&#x27;s &quot;Terminator 2&quot; in 1991, and Konami&#x27;s &quot;Lethal Enforcers&quot; in 1992. Further influenced by &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;, the genre remained popular into the late 1990s and declined following the rise of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre.

&quot;Operation Wolf&quot; spawned four sequels: &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; (1988), &quot;Operation Wolf 3&quot; (1994), &quot;Operation Tiger&quot; (1998), and &quot;Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission&quot; (2023).

<text>A is a type of smock, originating in Japan. First designed to protect kimono from stains when cooking, it has baggy sleeves with gathered cuffs terminating just after the elbow, and the torso comes down to the wearer&#x27;s knees. It closes by means of strips of cloth that are tied at the back of the neck and waist. It is particularly used when cooking and cleaning.

The was introduced at Japan&#x27;s first culinary academy, Akahori Kappō School, in 1902, when most people wore kimono on a daily basis.

<text>Puppy Linux is a family of light-weight Linux distributions that focus on ease of use and minimal memory footprint. The entire system can be run from random-access memory (RAM) with current versions generally taking up about 600 MB (64-bit), 300 MB (32-bit), allowing the boot medium to be removed after the operating system has started. Applications such as AbiWord, Gnumeric and MPlayer are included, along with a choice of lightweight web browsers and a utility for downloading other packages. The distribution was originally developed by Barry Kauler and other members of the community, until Kauler retired in 2013. The tool Woof can build a Puppy Linux distribution from the binary packages of other Linux distributions.

== History ==
Barry Kauler started Puppy Linux in response to a trend of other distributions becoming stricter on system requirements over time. His own distribution, with an emphasis on speed and efficiency and being lightweight, started from &quot;Boot disk HOWTO&quot; and gradually included components file-by-file until Puppy Linux was completed. Puppy Linux was initially based on Vector Linux but then became a fully independent distribution.

=== Release versions ===



Puppy 0.1 is the initial release of Puppy Linux. It has no UnionFS, extremely minimal persistence support, and has no package manager or ability to install applications.

Puppy 1.0 series runs comfortably on very dated hardware, such as a Pentium computer with at least 32 MB RAM. For newer systems, the USB key drive version might be better (although if USB device booting is not directly supported in the BIOS, the Puppy floppy boot disk can be used to kick-start it). It is possible to run Puppy Linux with Windows 9x/Me. It is also possible if the BIOS does not support booting from USB drive, to boot from the CD and keep user state on a USB key drive; this is saved on shutdown and read from the USB device on bootup.

Puppy 2.0 uses the Mozilla-based SeaMonkey as its Internet suite (primarily a web browser and e-mail client).

Puppy 3.0 features Slackware 12 compatibility. This is accomplished by the inclusion of almost all the dependencies needed for the installation of Slackware packages. However, Puppy Linux is not a Slackware-based distribution.

Puppy 4.0 is built from scratch using the T2 SDE and no longer features native Slackware 12 compatibility in order to reduce the size and include newer package versions than those found in 3. To compensate for this, an optional &quot;compatibility collection&quot; of packages was created that restores some of the lost compatibility.

Puppy 4.2.0–4.3.0 feature changes to the user interface and backend, upgraded packages, language and character support, new in-house software and optimizations, while still keeping the ISO image size under 100 MB.

Puppy 5.0.0–5.7.0 are based on a project called Woof, which is designed to assemble a Puppy Linux distribution from the packages of other Linux distributions. Woof includes some binaries and software derived from Ubuntu, Debian, Slackware, T2 SDE, or Arch repositories. Puppy 5 came with a stripped-down version of the Midori browser to be used for reading help files and a choice of web browsers to be installed, including Chromium, Firefox, SeaMonkey Internet Suite, Iron and Opera.

Puppy 6.0.5 is built from Ubuntu 14.04 &quot;Trusty Tahr&quot; packages, has binary compatibility with Ubuntu 14.04 and access to the Ubuntu package repositories. Tahrpup is built from the woof-CE build system, forked from Barry Kauler&#x27;s Woof late last year after he announced his retirement from Puppy development. It is built from the latest testing branch, incorporates all the latest woof-CE features and is released in PAE and noPAE ISOs, with the option to switch kernels.

Puppy 6.3.2 is built with Slackware packages instead of Ubuntu 14.04 &quot;Trusty Tahr&quot; packages but is very similar to its predecessor.

Puppy 7.5 is built from Ubuntu 16.04 &quot;Xenial Xerus&quot; packages, which has binary compatibility with Ubuntu 16.04 and access to the Ubuntu package repositories. XenialPup is built from the woof-CE build system, forked from Barry Kauler&#x27;s Woof. It is built from the latest testing branch, incorporates all the latest woof-CE features and is released in PAE and noPAE ISOs, with the option to switch kernels. It has a new UI, a new kernel update for greater hardware compatibility, redesigned Puppy Package Manager, some bugfixes and base packages inclusion into the woof structure.

Puppy 8.0 is built from Ubuntu &quot;Bionic Beaver&quot; 18.04.2 packages, has binary compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04.2 and access to the Ubuntu package repositories. BionicPup is built from the woof-CE build system, forked from Barry Kauler&#x27;s Woof. It is built from the latest testing branch and incorporates all the latest woof-CE features.

Puppy 8.2.1 is built from Raspberry Pi OS packages, has full support for the Raspberry Pi 0 to the Raspberry Pi 4, and is relatively similar to its predecessor. Raspberry Pi OS is based on Debian, meaning that Puppy Linux still has Debian/Ubuntu support. This version of Puppy Linux is not compatible with personal computers, like desktops or laptops.

Puppy 9.5 is built from Ubuntu &quot;Focal Fossa&quot; 20.04 (64-bit) packages, has binary compatibility with Ubuntu 20.04 and access to the Ubuntu repositories. FossaPup64 comes with JWM as the default window manager. Also, at this release, Puppy Linux&#x27;s Ubuntu-based release has dropped support for 32-bit (x86) computers, due to Ubuntu dropping 32-bit support at this release before reverting its decision and supporting only select 32-bit libraries. However, its Debian-based and mixed releases (i.e, BookwormPup32 and NoblePup32, respectively) continue to support 32-bit systems.

== Features ==
Puppy Linux is a complete operating system bundled with a collection of applications suited to general use tasks. It can be used as a rescue disk, a demonstration system that leaves the previous installation unaltered, as an accommodation for a system with a blank or missing hard drive, or for using modern software on legacy computers.

Puppy&#x27;s compact size allows it to boot from any media that the computer can support. It can function as a live USB for flash devices or other USB mediums, a CD, an internal hard disk drive, an SD card, a Zip drive or LS-120/240 SuperDisk, through PXE, and through a floppy boot disk that chainloads the data from other storage media. It has also been ported to ARM and can run on a single-board computer such as the Raspberry Pi.

Puppy Linux features built-in tools which can be used to create bootable USB drives, create new Puppy CDs, or remaster a new live CD with different packages. It also uses a sophisticated write-caching system with the purpose of extending the life of live USB flash drives.

Puppy Linux includes the ability to use a normal persistent updating environment on a write-once multisession CD/DVD that does not require a rewritable disc; this is a unique feature that sets it apart from other Linux distributions. While other distributions offer live CD versions of their operating systems, none offer a similar feature.

Puppy&#x27;s bootloader does not mount hard drives or connect to the network automatically. This ensures that a bug or even unknowingly incompatible software won&#x27;t corrupt the contents of such devices.

Puppy Linux offers a session save on shutdown. Since Puppy Linux fundamentally runs in RAM, any files and configurations made or changed in a session would disappear otherwise. This feature enables the user to either save the contents to a writable storage medium, or write the file system to the same CD containing Puppy, if &quot;multisession&quot; was used to create the booted CD and if the disc drive supports burning. This applies to CD-Rs, CD-RWs, and DVDs.

It is also possible to save all files to an external hard drive, USB stick, or even a floppy disk instead of the root file system. Puppy can also be installed to a hard disk.

==User interface==
The default window manager in most Puppy releases is JWM.

Packages of the IceWM desktop, Fluxbox and Enlightenment are also available via Puppy&#x27;s PetGet package (application) management system (see below). Some derivative distributions, called &quot;puplets&quot;, come with default window managers other than JWM.

When the operating system boots, everything in the Puppy package uncompresses into a RAM area, the &quot;ramdisk&quot;. The PC needs to have at least 128 MB of RAM (with no more than 8 MB shared video) for all of Puppy to load into the ramdisk. However, it is possible for it to run on a PC with only about 48 MB of RAM because part of the system can be kept on the hard drive, or less effectively, left on the CD.

Puppy is fairly full-featured for a system that runs entirely in a ramdisk, when booted as Live system or from a &quot;frugal&quot; installation. However, Puppy also supports the &quot;full&quot; installation mode, which enables Puppy to run from a hard drive partition, without a ramdisk. Applications were chosen that met various constraints, size in particular. Because one of the aims of the distribution is to be extremely easy to set up, there are many wizards that guide the user through a wide variety of common tasks.

==Package and distribution management==

Puppy Linux&#x27;s package manager, &quot;Puppy Package Manager&quot;, installs packages in PET (Puppy Enhanced Tarball) format by default but it also accepts packages from other distros (such as .deb, .rpm, .txz, and .tgz packages) or by using third-party tools to convert packages from other distros to PET packages. &quot;Puppy Package Manager&quot; can also trim the software bloat of a package to reduce the disk space used.

== Building the distribution ==
On earlier releases of Puppy Linux, Puppy Unleashed was used to create Puppy ISO images. It consists of more than 500 packages that are put together according to the user&#x27;s needs. However, on later versions starting with Puppy Linux version 5.0, it was replaced by Woof. It is an advanced tool for creating Puppy installations. It requires an Internet connection and some knowledge of Linux to use. It is able to download the binary source packages from another Linux distribution and process them into Puppy Linux packages by just defining the name of that Linux distro. It is equipped with a simpler version control named Bones on earlier releases but on later versions of woof, Fossil version control is used.

Puppy also comes with a remastering tool that takes a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the current system and lets the user create a live CD from it, and an additional remastering tool that is able to remove installed components.

Puppy Linux uses the T2 SDE build scripts to build the base binary packages.

==Official variants==
Because of the relative ease with which the Woof tool and the remaster tool can be used to build variants of Puppy Linux, there are many variants available. Variants of Puppy Linux are known as &quot;puplets&quot;.

After Barry Kauler reduced his involvement with the Puppy Project, he designed two new distributions within the same Puppy Linux family, Quirky and Wary.

Quirky – An embedded, less-stable distro with all files contained in an initramfs built into the kernel. It has simple module loading management but fewer drivers are included. It is used for experimental purposes.

Racy – A variant of puppy optimized for newer PCs.

Wary – A Puppy variant targeted at users with old hardware. It uses an older Linux kernel, which has long-term support and the newest applications.

Easy – A puppy variant in which the init script is completely rewritten and which uses originally developed application containers aside the conventional package management.

==Reception==
DistroWatch reviewer Rober Storey concluded about Puppy 5.2.5 in April 2011: &quot;A lot of people like Puppy — it&#x27;s in the top 10 of the DistroWatch page-hit ranking. I enjoy Puppy too, and it&#x27;s what I run exclusively on my netbook. Maybe the only thing wrong with Puppy is that users&#x27; expectations tend to exceed the developer&#x27;s intentions.&quot;

In a detailed review of Puppy Linux in May 2011 Howard Fosdick of OS News addressed the fact that Puppy Linux the user runs as the root UID, &quot;In theory this could be a problem — but in practice it presents no downside. I&#x27;ve never heard of a single Puppy user suffering a problem due to this.&quot; Fosdick concluded &quot;I like Puppy because it&#x27;s the lightest Linux distro I&#x27;ve found that is still suitable for end users. Install it on an old P-III or P-IV computer and your family or friends will use it just as effectively for common tasks as any expensive new machine.&quot;

In December 2011 Jesse Smith, writing in DistroWatch, reviewed Puppy 5.3.0 &quot;Slacko Puppy&quot;. He praised its simplicity, flexibility and clear explanations, while noting the limitations of running as root. He concluded &quot;I would also like to see an option added during the boot process which would give the user the choice of running in unprivileged mode as opposed to running as root. Always being the administrator has its advantages for convenience, but it means that the user is always one careless click away from deleting their files and one exploit away from a compromised operating system. As a live CD it&#x27;s hard to beat Puppy Linux for both performance and functional software. It has minimal hardware requirements and is very flexible. It&#x27;s a great distro as long as you don&#x27;t push it too far out of its niche.&quot;

In December 2011 Howard Fosdick reviewed the versions of Puppy Linux then available. He concluded, &quot;Puppy&#x27;s diversity and flexibility make it a great community-driven system for computer enthusiasts, hobbyists, and tinkerers. They also make for a somewhat disorderly world. You might have to read a bit to figure out which Puppy release or Puplet is for you. Puppy&#x27;s online documentation is extensive but can be confusing. It&#x27;s not always clear which docs pertain to which releases. Most users rely on the active, friendly forum for support.&quot; He also noted &quot;Those of us who enjoy computers sometimes forget that many view them with disdain. What&#x27;s wrong with it now? Why do I have to buy a new one every four years? Why on earth do they change the interface in every release? Can&#x27;t it just work? Puppy is a great solution for these folks. It&#x27;s up-to-date, free, and easy to use. And now, it supports free applications from the Ubuntu, Slackware, or Puppy repositories. Now that&#x27;s user-friendly.&quot;

An April 2020 review of Bionic 8.0 by Igor Ljubuncic in &quot;Dedoimedo&quot; concluded, &quot;Puppy Linux delivered on its happy message, and even exceeded my expectations. Now, I&#x27;ve always been a fan, and rarely had anything bad to say, so a positive result was kind of warranted. What really amazed me was not that this is a lean and fast little distro - it&#x27;s the fact it manages to keep its relevance despite the obvious lethargy in the Linux desktop space. You may say, well, why bother - but if you have older hardware or travel a lot, Puppy gives you your own, complete work session that will boot and run pretty much anywhere, with tons of goodies and excellent configuration tools.&quot;

<doc id="1033512" wikidata="Q6353269" url="?curid=1033512" title="Kaliveli Lake">
<text>Kaliveli Lake, or Kaliveli Lagoon, is a coastal lake and lagoon with wetlands in the Viluppuram District of Tamil Nadu state, in eastern South India.

This lake is on the Coromandel Coast, near the Bay of Bengal. It lies approximately north of Pondicherry city, and north of Auroville.

==Ecology==
Kaliveli Lake is a seasonal wetland, with a gradient from freshwater to brackish water, and is an important feeding and breeding ground on migratory bird flyway. The lake is one of the largest wetlands in peninsular India, and is considered a wetland of both national and international importance by the IUCN.

It is currently threatened by encroachment from agricultural fields, wildlife poaching, loss of the surrounding forests, and increased commercial prawn farming.

Despite being one of the melting pot of southern Indian Coastal ecological site, this lake is hardly explored by nature lovers and environmental enthusiasts. 90% of the shores of this lake are not accessible through roads, which is also the main reason for its abundance of flora and fauna. One must take care of dangerous sinking peats and bogs while wading through these swamps. Also, these swamps are infested with mites and bugs that are carriers of most feared filariasis, malaria and other waterborne diseases. Hence the trekkers are advised to carry bugs repellant creams and thick boots. As this lake is always isolated and noticing another human is almost impossible in its 20 km vicinity, explorers are advised to carry sufficient food, water and other essential items.

==History==
The ruins of colonial Allamparwa Fort are located at the north channel&#x27;s entrance point into Kaliveli Lagoon, on the Coromandel Coast.

<doc id="1033516" wikidata="Q4960281" url="?curid=1033516" title="Breeding bird survey">
<text>A breeding bird survey monitors the status and trends of bird populations. Data from the survey are an important source for the range maps found in field guides. The North American Breeding Bird Survey is a joint project of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Canadian Wildlife Service. The UK Breeding Bird Survey is administered by the British Trust for Ornithology, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

The results of the BBS are valuable in evaluating the increasing and decreasing range of bird population which can be a key point to bird conservation. The BBS was designed to provide a continent-wide perspective of population change.

==History==

The North American Breeding Bird Survey was launched in 1966 after the concept of a continental monitoring program for all breeding birds had been developed by Chandler Robbins and his associates from the Migratory Bird Population Station. The program was developed in Laurel, Maryland. In the first year of its existence there were nearly 600 surveys conducted east of the Mississippi River. One year later, in 1967, the survey spread to the Great Plains states and by 1968 almost 2000 routes had been established across southern Canada and 48 American states. As more birders were introduced to this program, the number of active BBS routes continued to increase. In the 1980s, the Breeding Bird Survey included Yukon, Northwest Territories of Canada and Alaska. Additionally, the number of routes in established states has increased. Currently, there are approximately 3700 active BBS routes in the United States and Canada, of which approximately 2900 are surveyed on an annual basis. The density of the routes varies greatly across the continent and the largest number of routes can be found in New England and Mid-Atlantic states. Many bird watchers participate in these surveys as they find the experience rewarding. Future plans for the BBS include expanding coverage in central and western North America, and adding routes in northern Mexico.

The surveys conducted by BBS take place during the peak of the nesting season; usually June, but also May in regions with warmer temperatures. A typical BBS route is 24.5 miles long with a stop every 0.5 miles, adding up to 50 stops per route. Routes are randomly located in order to sample habitats that are representative of the entire region. 

BBS data is quite difficult to analyze given that the survey does not produce a complete counting of the breeding bird populations but more like a relative abundance index. Even so, these surveys have proved to be of great value in studying bird population trends.

BBS data can also be used to produce continental-scale relative abundance maps. When analyzed at larger scales, the relative abundance maps can offer a clear indication of the status and distribution of bird species that are observed by the BBS. However, the most effective use of these surveys is the opportunity to analyze population trends, though information on the factors that cause these changes cannot be determined.

The BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a national project aimed at keeping track of changes in the breeding populations of widespread bird species in the UK. The program started in 1992, and has been successfully used by Governments and different non-Governmental organizations for bird conservation purposes since 1994. The RSPB BBS coordinates over 3200 active routes, with more than 3000 birders involved in monitoring the population trends of more than 100 bird species.

<text>The 73rd United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from March 4, 1933, to January 3, 1935, during the first two years of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency. Because of the newly ratified 20th Amendment, the duration of this Congress, along with the term of office of those elected to it, was shortened by days. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the 1930 United States census.

The Democrats greatly increased their majority in the House, and won control of the Senate for the first time since the 65th Congress in 1917. With Franklin D. Roosevelt being sworn in as president on March 4, 1933, this gave the Democrats an overall federal government trifecta, also for the first time since the 65th Congress.
==Major events==

*March 4, 1933: Franklin D. Roosevelt became President of the United States
*January 3, 1934: The second session of 73rd Congress convened as mandated by the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution, that had been ratified one year earlier
* August 19, 1934: House Speaker Henry Thomas Rainey died of a heart attack. The House had already completed its work for this Congress and had already adjourned. No Speaker was elected until the next Congress.

==Major legislation==
===First Session===
The first session of Congress, known as the &quot;Hundred Days&quot;, took place before the regular seating and was called by President Roosevelt specifically to pass two acts:
* March 9, 1933: The Emergency Banking Act (ch. 1, ) was enacted within four hours of its introduction. It was prompted by the &quot;bank holiday&quot; and was the first step in Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;first hundred days&quot; of the New Deal. The Act was drafted in large part by officials appointed by the Hoover administration. The bill provided for the Treasury Department to initiate reserve requirements and a federal bailout to large failing institutions. It also removed the United States from the Gold Standard. All banks had to undergo a federal inspection to deem if they were stable enough to re-open. Within a week 1/3 of the banks re-opened in the United States and faith was, in large part, restored in the banking system. The act had few opponents, only taking fire from the farthest left elements of Congress who wanted to nationalize banks altogether.
* March 20, 1933: The Economy Act of 1933. Roosevelt, in sending this act to Congress, warned that if it did not pass, the country faced a billion-dollar deficit. The act balanced the federal budget by cutting the salaries of government employees and cutting pensions to veterans by as much as 15 percent. It intended to reassure the deficit hawks that the new president was fiscally conservative. Although the act was heavily protested by left-leaning members of congress, it passed by an overwhelming margin.
The session also passed several other major pieces of legislation:

*March 31, 1933: The Civilian Conservation Corps Reforestation Relief Act (ch. 17, ) established the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) as a means to combat unemployment and poverty.
* May 12, 1933: The Agricultural Adjustment Act (ch. 25, ) was part of a plan developed by Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace, and was designed to protect American farmers from the uncertainties of the depression through subsidies and production controls. The act laid the frame for long-term government control in the planning of the agricultural sector. In 1936 the act was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court because it taxed one group to pay for another.
* May 12, 1933: The Federal Emergency Relief Act (ch. 30, ) established the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) which develop public works projects to give work to the unemployed.
* May 18, 1933: The Tennessee Valley Authority Act (ch. 32, ) created the Tennessee Valley Authority to relieve the Tennessee Valley by a series of public works projects.
* June 5, 1933: The Securities Act of 1933 (ch. 38, ) established the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) as a way for the government to prevent a repeat of the Stock Market Crash of 1929.
* June 12, 1933: The Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 (ch. 89, ) was a follow-up to the Glass–Steagall Act of 1932. Both acts sought to make banking safer and less prone to speculation. The 1933 act, however, established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
* June 16, 1933: The National Industrial Recovery Act (&quot;NIRA&quot;, ch. 90, ) was an anti-deflation scheme promoted by the Chamber of Commerce that reversed anti-trust laws and permit trade associations to cooperate in stabilizing prices within their industries while making businesses ensure that the incomes of workers would rise along with their prices. It guaranteed to workers of the right of collective bargaining and helped spur major union organizing drives in major industries. In case consumer buying power lagged behind, thereby defeating the administration&#x27;s initiatives, the NIRA created the Public Works Administration (PWA), a major program of public works spending designed to alleviate unemployment, and moreover to transfer funds to certain beneficiaries. The NIRA established the most important, but ultimately least successful provision: a new federal agency known as the National Recovery Administration (NRA), which attempted to stabilize prices and wages through cooperative &quot;code authorities&quot; involving government, business, and labor. The NIRA was seen hailed as a miracle, responding to the needs of labor, business, unemployment, and the deflation crisis. The &quot;sick chicken case&quot; led to the Supreme Court invalidating NIRA in 1935.

===Second Session===
* March 24, 1934: The Tydings–McDuffie Act (, ) provided for self-government for the Commonwealth of the Philippines and a pathway to independence.
* June 6, 1934: The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ch. 404, ) grew out of the Securities Act of 1933 and regulated participation in financial markets.
* June 6, 1934: The National Firearms Act of 1934 (ch. 757, ) regulated machine guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns.
* June 19, 1934: Communications Act of 1934 (ch. 652, , )

==Constitutional amendments==
* December 5, 1933: Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, repealing the eighteenth amendment and thus ending prohibition in the United States, was ratified by the requisite number of states (then 36) to become part of the Constitution

==Hearings==

===&quot;Merchants of Death&quot;===
*Committee: United States Senate Special Committee on Investigation of the Munitions Industry
*Chairman: Senator Gerald P. Nye (R)
*Duration: September 4, 1934 – February 24, 1936

The Senate Munitions Committee came into existence solely for the purpose of this hearing. Although World War I had been over for sixteen years, there were revived reports that America&#x27;s leading munition companies had effectively influenced the United States into that conflict, which killed 53,000 Americans, hence the companies&#x27; nickname &quot;Merchants of Death&quot;.

The Democratic Party, controlling the Senate for the first time since the first world war, used the hype of these reports to organize the hearing in hopes of nationalizing America&#x27;s munitions industry. The Democrats chose a Republican renowned for his ardent isolationist policies, Senator Gerald P. Nye of North Dakota, to head the hearing. Nye was typical of western agrarian progressives, and adamantly opposed America&#x27;s involvement in any foreign war. Nye declared at the opening of the hearing &quot;when the Senate investigation is over, we shall see that war and preparation for war is not a matter of national honor and national defense, but a matter of profit for the few.&quot;

Over the next 18 months, the &quot;Nye Committee&quot; (as newspapers called it) held 93 hearings, questioning more than 200 witnesses, including J.P. Morgan Jr. and Pierre du Pont. Committee members found little hard evidence of an active conspiracy among arms makers, yet the panel&#x27;s reports did little to weaken the popular prejudice against &quot;greedy munitions interests.&quot;

The hearings overlapped the 73rd and 74th Congresses. They only came to an end after Chairman Nye provoked the Democratic caucus into cutting off funding. Nye, in the last hearing the Committee held in early 1936, attacked former Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, suggesting that Wilson had withheld essential information from Congress as it considered a declaration of war. Democratic leaders, including Appropriations Committee Chairman Carter Glass of Virginia, unleashed a furious response against Nye for &quot;dirtdaubing the sepulcher of Woodrow Wilson.&quot; Standing before cheering colleagues in a packed Senate chamber, Glass slammed his fist onto his desk in protest until blood dripped from his knuckles, effectively prompting the Democratic caucus to withhold all funding for further hearings.

Although the &quot;Nye Committee&quot; failed to achieve its goal of nationalizing the arms industry, it inspired three congressional neutrality acts in the mid-1930s that signaled profound American opposition to overseas involvement.

<text>U.F.O. (also known as U.F.O. - The Movie) is a 1993 British science fiction spoof directed by Tony Dow and starring Roy Chubby Brown in the role of a blue comedian whose act offends a pair of female aliens, who proceed to kidnap him and put him on trial.

==Plot==
Performing one night at the end of Blackpool Pier, stand-up comedian Chubby is beamed up to a spaceship populated by feminist aliens. Put on trial for crimes against women and quickly found guilty, the unapologetic misogynist is condemned to become pregnant every year for the next thirty years.

==Cast==
* Roy Chubby Brown — himself
* Sara Stockbridge — Zoe
* Roger Lloyd-Pack — Solo
* Amanda Symonds  — Ava
* Shirley Anne Field — Judge
* Kenny Baker — Casanova
* Kiran Shah — Genghis Khan
* Rusty Goffe — King Henry VIII
* Sue Lloyd — Judge
* Antony Georghiou  — Count Dracula
* Ben Aris — Doctor Richard Head
* Paul Barber — The Doctor (voice)

==Production==
The film was shot at Pinewood Studios.

==Reception==
It was reviewed poorly, with &quot;Empire&quot; calling the film &quot;a stand-up show, allowing the comedian to tell his sexist jokes to a race of aliens who charge him for being a misogynist&quot; and rating it 1/5. Geoffrey Mcnab from &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; said it was &quot;wildly uneven, often offensive, but with a cheerful inanity which goes some way to compensate for its grosser shortcomings&quot;.

The film opened on 45 screens on 10 December 1993 in the United Kingdom and grossed £73,925 for the weekend, placing ninth. It was expected to recover its budget of $2 million through video rentals and sales.

The film was initially banned on video in Ireland.

<text>The 48th (South Midland) Division was an infantry division of the British Army. Part of the Territorial Force (TF) and raised in 1908, the division was originally called the South Midland Division, and was redesignated as the 48th (South Midland) Division in 1915. During the First World War, the division saw service on the Western Front before being transferred to the Italian Front in November 1917 and remaining there for the rest of the war.

Reformed in 1920 in the Territorial Army (TA) as the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division, it saw active service in the Second World War with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in Belgium and France before being evacuated from Dunkirk to the United Kingdom. It was converted into a training reserve division in December 1942, remaining in the United Kingdom in that status for the rest of the war. Disbanded after the war, the division was not reformed again. In both world wars, the division raised a second line reserve formation; the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division in the First World War, and 61st Division in the Second World War.

==Formation==
In 1901, following lessons learned from the Second Boer War and diplomatic clashes with the growing German Empire, the United Kingdom sought to reform the British Army so it would be able to engage in European affairs if required. This task fell to Secretary of State for War, Richard Haldane who implemented several policies known as the Haldane Reforms. As part of these reforms, the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 created a new Territorial Force by merging the existing Yeomanry and Volunteer Force in 1908. This resulted in the creation of 14 Territorial Divisions, including the South Midland Division.

As part of the legislation, the territorials were only liable to serve within the United Kingdom. Haldane envisioned that the territorials would take over the defence of the country against what was perceived as a very real threat of invasion, which would allow the regular army to be deployed aboard. In addition, Haldane saw the territorials as a source of reinforcements for the regular army. Six months following mobilisation, during which time the troops would have come up to an acceptable training standard, Haldane was confident that up to a quarter of the men would opt to go and fight abroad.

The 1910 edition of the Hazell&#x27;s Annual reported that, in 1909, &quot;The South Midland Division ... had 13 units up to or over establishment, and the others very little below it.&quot; The following year, the Territorial Force as a whole peaked at a strength of 276,000 men; 26,000 men short of the peacetime establishment set by Haldane&#x27;s reforms. However, between 1910 and 1914, the overall strength of the force had declined to 250,000, 52,000 short of the peacetime establishment. In peacetime, the divisional headquarters was in the Old Barracks in Warwick.

==First World War==
===1914===

On the outbreak of war, the division composed the Warwickshire Brigade, the Gloucester and Worcester Brigade and the South Midland Brigade. In August 1914, the South Midland Division departed for its annual summer training camp. The 143rd (Warwickshire) Brigade, for example, departed for Rhyl in northern Wales. Following the declaration of war, the division was mobilised and moved south to take up defensive positions along the southern coast. Due to German-invasion scares, the division-numbering 6,000 men-moved to Essex. While there was no invasion, the division remained in the area on defensive duties and to continue training.

During the opening weeks of the war, as the Territorials were not required to be deployed overseas, the troops were asked to volunteer. By the end of August, more than 70 battalions across the Territorial Force had volunteered with the number rising higher as the year progressed.
===1915–1918===
In March 1915, with the threat of a German invasion having subsided, the South Midland Division was dispatched to France with the territorials who had volunteered for overseas service.

On 13 May 1915 the division was numbered, becoming the 48th (South Midland) Division and the brigades in the division were also numbered, the Warwickshire Brigade became the 143rd (Warwickshire) Brigade, the Gloucester and Worcester Brigade became the 144th (Gloucester and Worcester) Infantry Brigade and the South Midland Brigade became the 145th (South Midland) Infantry Brigade.

The members of the division who did not, or were not able to, volunteer for overseas service, were transferred to newly created second line units intended for home defence. These second line units were eventually formed into the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division and, following the passing of the Military Service Act 1916, deployed to France in February 1916.

The division took part in the Battle of the Somme in 1916, the Battle of Pozières and the Third Battle of Ypres. In November 1917, the division was sent to Italy, where it remained until the end of the War. It fought the on Asiago Plateau (15–16 June 1918) and the Battle of Vittorio Veneto.

==Interwar==
After the war, the 48th Divisional Signal Company was posted to Iran as part of Norperforce.
The division was disbanded in June 1919, along with the rest of the Territorial Force. However, the Territorial Force was reformed in 1920 as the Territorial Army (TA) and the 48th Division was reconstituted as the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division.

During the interwar period, the British Army envisioned that, during future conflicts, the Territorial Army would be used as the basis for future expansion so as to avoid raising a new Kitchener&#x27;s Army. However, as the 1920s and 1930s wore on, the British Government prioritised funding for the regular army over the territorials, allowing recruitment and equipment levels to languish. Baron Templemore, as part of a House of Lords debate on the Territorial Army, stated that the division - on 1 October 1924 - mustered 338 officers and 7,721 other ranks. Historian David French highlights that &quot;by April 1937 the Territorial Army had reached less than 80 per cent of its shrunken peacetime establishment&quot; and &quot;Its value as an immediate reserve was, therefore, limited.&quot; Edward Smalley comments that &quot;48th Divisional Signals operated on an improvised organizational structure&quot; for most of the 1930s, due to being below 50 per cent strength. He further highlights how the TA, and the division in particular, &quot;never kept pace with technological developments.&quot; In 1937, the division was operating just two radio sets on a full-time basis and had to borrow additional units from the 3rd Infantry Division for annual training camps.

==Second World War==
On the outbreak of the Second World War, the 48th Division was mobilised in early September 1939, under the command of Major General Frank Roberts, who had won the Victoria Cross (VC) in the Great War. After spending a few months in England training the division, now commanded by Major General Sir Andrew Thorne after Roberts&#x27; retirement in December, landed in France in early January 1940 and became part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), the first complete division of the TA to do so. The division came under command of Lieutenant General Sir John Dill&#x27;s I Corps. Soon after their arrival, the 48th Division exchanged some of its units with the Regular divisions. For example, in the 143rd Brigade, the 5th Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment was exchanged with the 1st Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, a Regular Army unit, and transferred to the 11th Infantry Brigade, of the 4th Infantry Division. This was official policy within the BEF and was, in theory, intended to strengthen the inexperienced Territorial divisions with experienced Regulars.

===France and Dunkirk===
When the Germans invaded France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940, the BEF moved forward to occupy pre-planned positions in Belgium, but the rapid German breakthrough into France caused it to retreat towards Dunkirk.

On 23 May, 48th Division was pulled out to form a new defence line along the canal between Saint-Omer and the coast. Lord Gort&#x27;s BEF story describes the distinguished and heroic defence by General Thorne, commanding the 48th Division and the delaying actions of his 145th Brigade at Cassel and Hazebrouck and 144th Brigade at Wormhoudt, saying that &quot;it was their defence on the western side of the corridor in the closing stages that allowed so many of their comrades to pass into safety&quot;. The 48th and 44th Divisions withstood repeated attacks along the 20 mile frontage. On 28 May when the front began to crumble all around them, they were ordered to continue to hold for a few more hours. The garrison from 145 Brigade at Hazebrouck was overrun but some elements at Cassel and 144 Brigade at Wormhoudt withdrew that night. The remnants of 44th division and 48th Division were attached to 1st Corps and the last to leave the beaches on 30 May.

During the same time frame the 48th divisional CRA (Commander, Royal Artillery), Brigadier Edward Lawson, was sent with &#x27;X Force&#x27; of artillery, machine guns and infantry ahead of the division to occupy the chosen positions. However, the unexpected surrender of Belgian forces on 27 May 1940 led to a gap appearing between 48th Division in action around Saint-Omer and the coast at Nieuwpoort. Until II Corps could arrive to plug this gap, Lawson was responsible for what the &quot;Official History&quot; calls &#x27;the most dangerously exposed part of the bridgehead&#x27;. He was ordered by the commander of the Dunkirk perimeter, the III Corps commander Lieutenant-General Ronald Adam, to improvise a defence line along the canal and prevent the Germans breaking through to the vital beaches east of Dunkirk where much of the BEF was waiting to be evacuated. At 11.00 on 28 May, advanced German troops reached the canal line, but Lawson seized on the Territorial gunners of the 53rd (London) Medium Regiment, RA who were marching towards Dunkirk having fired off all their ammunition and destroyed their guns. Together with detachments of Regular gunners from both the 2nd Medium and 1st Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiments, and sappers from 7th Field Company, Royal Engineers, they fought as infantry to hold the line. They came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, and the Germans seized a bridgehead at Nieuwpoort, but all subsequent attacks that day were repulsed. Brigadier Lawson&#x27;s scratch force was relieved next day and then evacuated to Britain.

===Home defence and training===
The 48th Division, much depleted in numbers, completed its return to the United Kingdom on 1 June. The division, commanded from 18 June by Major General Roderic Petre, was subsequently posted to Western Command, Southern Command, and VIII Corps under Lieutenant General Harold Franklyn and began training in preparation to repel Operation Sea Lion, the German invasion of England, which proved abortive.

During the war, the divisions of the British Army were divided between &quot;Higher Establishment&quot; and &quot;Lower Establishment&quot; formations. The former were intended for deployment overseas for field operations, whereas the latter were strictly for home defence in a static role. During November 1941, the division was placed on the &quot;Lower Establishment&quot; and assigned to I Corps District, commanded by Lieutenant General Henry Willcox.
During the winter of 1942–43, the British Army overhauled its training of recruits. The 48th was one of three divisions that were changed from &quot;Lower Establishment&quot; units to &quot;Reserve Divisions&quot;. On 20 December, the division was renamed the 48th Infantry (Reserve) Division, becoming a training formation in the process. This reorganisation took place during 1943 and the division held this training role for the remainder of the war. These three divisions were supplemented by a fourth training formation (the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division), which was raised on 1 January 1943. The 48th Infantry (Reserve) Division was assigned to Northern Command Soldiers who had completed their corps training were sent to these training divisions. The soldiers were given five weeks of additional training at the section, platoon and company level, before undertaking a final three-day exercise. Troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations. Training was handled in this manner to relieve the &quot;Higher Establishment&quot; divisions from being milked for replacements for other units and to allow them to intensively train without having to cope with recruits. During this period, from 17 October 1942 until 30 September 1943, the 10th Tank Brigade was assigned to the division for the holding and training of reinforcements to armoured units. On 7 November 1943, the 145th Infantry Brigade was disbanded.

On 30 June 1944, the 48th Infantry (Reserve) Division, along with the other training divisions (the 76th, 77th, and the 80th), had a combined total of 22,355 men. Of this number, only 1,100 were immediately available as replacements for the 21st Army Group, at the time of Operation Overlord and the Battle of Normandy. The remaining 21,255 men were considered ineligible for service abroad due to a variety of reasons, ranging from medical, not being considered fully fit or insufficiently trained. Over the following six months, up to 75 per cent of these men were deployed to reinforce the 21st Army Group, following the completion of their training and having met the required fitness levels. In 2007, Stephen Hart wrote that, by September, the 21st Army Group &quot;had bled Home Forces dry of draftable riflemen&quot;, due to the losses suffered in the Battle of Normandy, leaving the army in Britain (with the exception of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division) with just &quot;young lads, old men and the unfit&quot;.

Due to the decreased need for such a formation, the division was disbanded after the war on 1 November 1945.

===Postwar===
The division was not reformed in the Territorial Army in 1947. In 1961 the division became a district headquarters as 48th (South Midland) Division/District, and it was disbanded on the reduction of the TA into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve on 1 April 1967, when many individual TA units lost their identities. The district headquarters itself formed the core of the structure for the creation of West Midlands District under HQ UK Land Forces in 1972.

<doc id="1033534" wikidata="Q4794504" url="?curid=1033534" title="Kırkpınar">
<text>Kırkpınar (Turkish for &quot;forty springs&quot;) is a Turkish oil wrestling (yağlı güreş) tournament where pehlivans (wrestlers) compete for three days. It is held annually, usually in late June, near Edirne, Turkey since 1360. In the finals held on the last day, the first, second and third winners of each category are determined. During the tournament, also the Kırkpınar Festival is organized.

Oil wrestling is a sport at the forefront of traditional Turkish sports. Wrestling was held in all of the fairs organized all over the Ottoman Empire, but the wrestler who won the &quot;chief&quot; title only in Kırkpınar was known as the &quot;chief wrestler&quot; until the next year&#x27;s Kırkpınar wrestling. This idea continues to this day.

==Description==
The contestants wear only leather knee-length shorts called &quot;kıspet&quot;s. Before each bout, the wrestlers pour olive oil over their entire bodies.

Kırkpınar holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running athletic competition.

==History==
===Oldest known evidence===
The history of oil wrestling links back to 2650 BC with evidence from Ancient Egypt, Assyria, and other regions in the Middle East. The Babylonian body of evidence, a tiny bronze, was excavated near the Chafadji-temple. The bronze clearly concerns oil wrestlers as both athletes are depicted with olive vessels on their heads.

The oldest-known proof of the existence of oil-wrestling in Ancient Egypt is found in limestone from the tomb of Ptahhoteb near Saqqara from the Fifth dynasty (about 2650 BC) from the same period as the Chafadji-bronze.

Another appealing proof is about 4000 years old and painted like a cartoon in a tomb near Beni Hasan in Egypt. The deceased, who occupied this tomb, is assumed to have been a famous oil-wrestler in his time. In the first picture, the greasing of the wrestler and the oil stored in a reed stem is seen. In the second picture the wrestling starts. The last picture down shows the three step triumph of oiled wrestling, which is unchanged to this day. From this, the basic rules of the sport can be traced.

Centuries later, the Persian Empire conquered Egypt, and the Persian shah occupied the Pharaoh&#x27;s throne. It was during this period that oil wrestling began in Iran.

=== Oil-wrestling in Iran ===

The history of the oil-wrestling tournaments as they are known today dates to the Persian Mythical Era, which, according to Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnameh, started in 1065 BC. The legendary pehlivan of this era is called Rostam, a hero depicted to constantly save his country from evil forces.

The ceremonial start of oil-wrestling, called by its Persian name &quot;Peshrev&quot; has clear links with old Iranian institutes as the Zurkhane, literally &quot;house of strength&quot;. The building consists of a court, around which the men who will perform, arrange themselves, and a gallery for the ostad (&quot;master&quot;) or morshed (spiritual leader) and the musicians. Nowadays, the musical accompaniment consists of a drum and recitation of portions of Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahname. Various rhythms are employed, and a variety of movements associated with them, including displays of strength in manipulating heavy objects (such as weights and chains) and acrobatics.

Here the origin of the peshrev is found, considered by some to be preparation and a ceremony to greet the audience, to others a participatory form of dance. It is different from the usual step-right, step-left, step-right, kick-left, step-left, kick-right dance encountered in the rest of the region.

=== Greco-Roman Oil-wrestling ===

The word &quot;Pehlivan&quot; for a wrestler was first used in this period, when the Parthians (238 BC - 224 AD) expelled the Greeks from Iran.

=== Huns ===

The Huns arrived on the fringes of the Roman Empire in the late 4th century, moved on horseback out of the steppes of Central Asia into Germany and France. As they approached the Black Sea and conquered the Ostrogoths, they also drove the Visigoths across the Danube into the Roman Empire, causing the crisis that led to the astounding defeat of the Roman army under the Emperor Valens near Adrianople (Edirne) in 378 AD.

The Huns were fanatic wrestlers as well as horsemen. After securing a strong position on the Roman side of the Danube, the Huns were checked by the Roman army of general Aspar in Thrace (442).

In 447, Pehlivan Attila came again into Thrace and stopped only when Emperor Thodosius II begged for terms. During the negotiations, a Roman-Hun wrestling competition was held in Thermopylae. The dispute was settled by a wrestling match and winner Attila accepted payment of all tribute in arrears and a new annual tribute of 2,100 pounds of gold and territory south of the Danube.

Three years later Emperor Theodosius died falling from his horse. His successor, Marcian (450-457), refused to pay Attila. The Huns did not retaliate, because the sister of the Roman Emperor Valentinian III, Honoria, sent to him her ring and a message to the King of the Huns and asked Attila to become her champion. Attila agreed to this marriage proposal. When the sister of the Roman Emperor was imprisoned, Attila decided to take care of her dowry. As Honoria was not available, next year Attila took a new, young bride named Ildico. The wedding day was spent with one of the greatest wrestling matches of this time.

=== Oil-wrestling for Sultan and Shah ===

During the period when Islam was brought into Asia Minor, spirituality and philosophy became part of the physical garment of the pehlivan. Oil-wrestling was established as a sport on its own. In Iran and the Ottoman Empire alike, wrestling became the national sport. In Iran, wrestling grew to the customary institution of the Zurkhane strong house, where people went to socialise and engage in athletic exercise. The wrestler is the strong-man in popular culture (in Persian the term is &quot;big neck&quot;), but he is also the pahlavan, the knightly hero, who is a free-living spirit and is generous and loyal.

The year 1360 is adopted by the organizers of the Edirne Kırkpınar as the date when Ottoman soldiers started to organize annual oil-wrestling tournaments in Kırkpınar, a wrestling field &quot;within the samona village&quot;. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, this legend made Kırkpınar the world&#x27;s oldest continuously sanctioned sporting competition.

Once, the last bout between the two finalists was said to last through the night as neither was able to defeat the other. They were found dead the next morning, their bodies still intertwined. They were buried underneath a nearby fig tree, whereupon their comrades headed to conquer Edirne.

After the conquest, the soldiers came upon another fig tree, surrounded by a crystal-clear spring, so they renamed the surrounding meadow (which until then had been known as Ahirköy) Kırkpınar, which translates from Turkish as &quot;forty springs&quot; or &quot;forty sources&quot;. To commemorate the heroism of the conquering warriors, a wrestling tournament is re-enacted annually at this site.

In all tales, myths, and stories, there has always been a common respect for the oil-wrestlers. The pehlivan is described as being stronger than anybody, having a well built body, and clothed in heavy leather pants. From the past until now, the wrestlers have poured olive oil onto their bodies. In addition, it is still possible to see younger wrestlers kissing the hands of older athletes despite having defeated them, which is a gesture of respect.

According to historian Burhan Katia, the word pehlivan was also used for an officer, governor or huge and honest person. From the 16th century on, the term was exclusively used in the Ottoman Empire for the wrestler.

In 1590, a peace treaty was signed between Murat III and the Persian Shah. The model of the wrestling pants go back to this period. The design is still same for the Iranian &quot;pahlivan&quot; and the Turkish &quot;pehlivan&quot;, except the Turkish wrestling pants are made of leather and are called &quot;kispet&quot;, while the Iranian pahlivan wears a &quot;pirpet&quot;, made of silk.

Famous wrestlers from Iran came to Istanbul to compete with the Ottoman champions, and the Turkish champions were invited to Persia to show their strength.

=== Collecting strong men ===

Before 1582, all wrestlers were obtained from prisoners of war, the Devşirme, or other slave sources. With the Devşirme system, the healthiest and strongest young men were recruited from the various provinces of the Ottoman Empire, and pehlivans trained from Devşirme boys were always known to be free enough to be honest, and throughout history trusted for their word and behaviour.

Wrestling championships were held everywhere in the Ottoman Empire. Every city and village had its annual wrestling event, like the one organized in Edirne today. Wrestling occurred in a variety of contexts, including social and ceremonial events. There were wrestling events on religious festival days, during special evenings of the Muslim fasting-month of Ramadan, on agricultural events, circumcisions and weddings. On special occasions, charity wrestling competitions were organized outside the palaces. Only the best wrestlers were accepted in training to become members of the elite Janissary Corps.

=== Oil-wrestling for French Impératrice Eugenie ===

When the Ottoman sultan visited France in 1867, oil-wrestlers were part of his entourage and Impératrice Eugenie visited the wrestling-tournament. Wrestling was a tough sport, but oil-wrestling was even harder. It was considered the most difficult sport in the world.

=== Virantekke ===

After the Balkan War of 1912, the event&#x27;s original Kırkpınar location was lost, so the tournament was relocated to Virantekke, now the Kapitan Andreevo checkpoint on the Bulgarian border.

=== Edirne ===

After 12 years, the annual oil-wrestling competition of Kırkpınar moved to yet another location. Since 1924, bouts are held on the Sarayiçi island near Edirne.

The last Ottoman sultan was exiled to Malta. In what remained of the Empire, almost everything traditional was replaced or westernized. The language was &quot;purified&quot; by replacing words of Persian or Arabic origin with words derived from Turkic roots. Even a sport prevailing any western sport was at stake. Atatürk thought of putting the wrestling organizations directly under his own sponsorship. He ordered Selim Sırrı Tarcan (1874–1956) to restyle oil-wrestling according to his guidelines for sport in the new Turkish Republic.

As a result, the winner of the Edirne competition was no longer &quot;Başpehlivan of the Kırkpınar&quot; but &quot;Champion of Turkey&quot;. Instead of traditional prizes such as the &quot;Altın Kemer&quot; (Golden Belt) and horses, donkeys, or camels; medals similar to those in the Western world began to be awarded.

It was feared that with such a change of reward &quot;because they did so in Europe&quot; effect a lack of participation by the pehlivans. The officer responsible for sports in the new republic had to come to a compromise, allowing the winning wrestler in the highest category to be awarded the title of &quot;Başpehlivan of the Year&quot;, and rewards of whichever animals the organizers could obtain. Selim Sırrı Tarcan also restricted the Golden Belt: It could only be awarded for the Edirne Kırkpınar, and only to a &quot;Turkish Champion&quot; who had won the event for three consecutive years. The weight of the Belt was limited to 1450g of 14-carat gold.

The Kırkpınar wrestling competitions of Edirne were still held under the protectorate of the &quot;Agha&quot;. The Agha welcomed his guests and accommodated them in the hotel, held dinners, and organized festivities. Also, he awarded the prizes to the winners in their categories. Just before the final of the Kırkpınar, the organizing Agha held an auction. The bids were placed on a ram or sheep. The highest bidder became the &quot;agha&quot; of the next year&#x27;s Kırkpınar and the main sponsor of the event.

When in 1928 an economic depression hit Turkey and no agha could be found, Selim Sırrı Tarcan made the Turkish Red Crescent (Kızılay) and the Institute of Child Care (Çocuk Esirgeme Kurumu) responsible for the organization and hosting of the guests.

In the olden days of the event, an agha was able to stop a match, disqualify wrestlers if necessary, and even cancel the wrestling events altogether. Today, the organizing committee makes such decisions. The Red Crescent and the Institute of Child Care would organize the Edirne Kırkpınar for 36 years, after which the task of organizing the event was assigned to the municipality of Edirne.

=== Edirne Kırkpınar municipality service ===

In 1964, the mayor of Edirne, Tahsin Sipka, signed an act making the Edirne Municipality responsible for the organization of the Edirne Kırkpınar. That same year, Mayor Sipka made the Edirne Kırkpınar a municipal service.

During a year, about 300 different oil-wrestling games are held in Turkey. They host an average of ten million spectators.

=== Introduction of time ===

Until 1975, there was no time-limit for wrestling in Kırkpınar. The pehlivans would sometimes wrestle one or two days, until they could establish superiority over their foes. Wrestling games would last from 9am until dusk and matches without a winner would continue the next day. After 1975, wrestling was limited to 40 minutes in the başpehlivan category. If there is no winner within these limits, the pehlivans wrestle for 15 more minutes with scores recorded. Those who score the most points in this last period are accepted as the winners. In other categories, the wrestling time is limited to 30 minutes. If there is no winner, ten minutes of scored wrestling follows.

=== Federation ===

On 20 June 1996, the Turkish Federation of Traditional Sport Branches (Geleneksel Spor Dallari Federasyonu) was founded by the Turkish Ministry. Riding, oil-wrestling, aba-wrestling and other traditional sports were assembled in the same federation under Alper Yazoğlu.

=== Oil-wrestling inroads in Amsterdam ===

During the 636th annual Kırkpınar of Edirne, Agha (mc) Hüseyin Sahin agreed with Veyis Güngör, the chairman of Türkevi Amsterdam, and Mohamed el-Fers (MokumTV Amsterdam) that they would unite their forces to promote traditional oil-wrestling in Europe and the world. For three days El-Fers filmed almost every match.

On 4 September 1996, MokumTV started a weekly program on the A1 Amsterdam channel, presenting this highly aesthetic &quot;mother of all sports&quot;.

The late Hüseyin Sahin said during his speech, attended by Turkish president Süleyman Demirel, Edirne-mayor Hamdi Sedefçi, Veyis Güngör and Mohamed el-Fers that the Kırkpınar will exceed the borders of Turkey and unite the world.

The champion wrestlers, who attended that 636th Edirne Kırkpınar applauded the news of an Amsterdam Kırkpınar. In his speech at the award ceremony, President Süleyman Demirel said that Turkey would continue to raise world-famous wrestlers. Veyis Güngör told the press that the enthusiastic reactions in Europe proved that this traditional Turkish sport is not only everlasting, but thanks to television and video, is gaining popularity among non-Turkish people as well. In the days after the news was released, organisers received about 950 letters from oil-wrestlers throughout Turkey, who would enter competition for the title of Euro-champion of the Amsterdam Kırkpınar.

In 1997, the &quot;Mother of All Sports&quot; débuted in Western Europe, when the European Champions League was held in Amsterdam. No less than 22 television teams covered the event, and scenes from the Amsterdam Kırkpınar were shown on CNN and the BBC alike.

The 2nd European Oil-Wrestling Championship held in Amsterdam already had a final with 42 wrestlers from Turkey, the Netherlands and other European countries. The winner was Cengiz Elbeye, Edirne Kırkpınar oil-wrestling champion. During the opening ceremony, Erkut Onart, the Turkish Consul General in the Netherlands, said that he believed the friendship between Turkish society and the European countries is intensified when these kinds of cultural values are brought to Europe.

In the world of oil-wrestling, Amsterdam became the most important annual event, after Edirne.

=== Special branch ===

Oil-wrestling was accepted as special branch by the Turkish Olympic Wrestling Federation. Sport and politics, as in 1996 the Turkish Federation of Traditional Sport Branches (Geleneksel Spor Dallari Federasyonu) was officially accepted as the federation representing oil-wrestling and other traditional Turkish sports.

=== Anti-doping control ===

In 1999, anti-doping checks were introduced by the Turkish Olympic Wrestling Federation during the Edirne Kırkpınar.

=== Foreign oil-wrestler rejected in Edirne ===

Oil-wrestling is a growing sport, not limited to Turkey. However, it is difficult for foreign wrestlers to enter this National Turkish Championship. In 2000, Dutch oil-wrestler Melvin Witteveen&#x27;s entry in Edirne was rejected.

The event attracted little attention outside of Turkey until the 1990s, when the style of wrestling began to spread to Western Europe. It has become particularly popular in the Netherlands, which now hosts its own annual version of the tournament, attracting participants from throughout Europe. Yağlı güreş wrestling matches are also held in Japan.

==Most wins==
Hüseyin Pehlivan won the event 7 consecutive years, starting 1935. Ahmet Taşçı won the event 9 times in 11 years. The 2021 event was won by Ali Gürbüz, his 4th victory.

<text>On 17 April 1945, the retreating German occupying forces inundated the polder of Wieringermeer, the Netherlands.

==Preparations==
In 1945 German forces occupying the Netherlands planned to destroy the Zuiderzee Works to cover their retreat. Military reasons for this are still unclear, but it may have been done to deny the Allies a landing area for airborne troops or gliders. In preparation for this flooding, the water level of the IJsselmeer was deliberately raised. The level in the IJsselmeer was above the ground level of Wieringerpolder at the site of the breach, and varied between above, across the polder. Inundation had already been used on some Dutch polders but this strategic inundation was shallow and was done by stopping the drainage pumping or allowing water to flow backwards through the pumping stations to give a shallow flooding. The rapid and deep tactical inundation planned for the Wieringerpolder, done by the destruction of a dyke, was new. It was known that even an explosive breach would not be enough, and it would be the enlargement of the breach by the water itself which would cause the most damage.

In late February or early March 1945 Dutch workers started to undermine the dike around the polder under German command. The location is near the farm of Beetstra, in the dike with the IJsselmeer. Deep holes were dug in the dike both at the bottom and at the top of the dike. In these holes explosives would be put. The work was progressing slowly since none of the workers were motivated. In April, the work came to a complete stop.

On April 10, German officers came and inspected the work. New workers were sought and 25 to 50 people were taken from Schagen during a razzia to work on the digging. After a week, the holes were deep enough and explosives were installed. Each hole was loaded with of explosives; unexploded bombs from British and American aircraft were used.

== Flooding ==

On 17 April at 12.15 am, the explosives were detonated. The 7,000 people in the Wieringermeer and an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 refugees had to leave the polder. Within 48 hours, the entire polder was full with water, with an average depth of 

The initial breaches were small, about wide and only below water level. These increased over the following hours until two huge pits were scoured out, the northern one wide and deep and the southern hole wide and deep.

No one was killed as the polder slowly submerged again (the inhabitants had been warned), but the high water and a subsequent storm destroyed most of the infrastructure built in the previous decade. Buildings were not generally badly damaged by the flooding, but by the storms later.

As civilians left the flooding polder through the military checkpoints, the Resistance member , of Wieringermeer, was captured and then shot whilst trying to escape. 
== Reconstruction ==

Reconstruction followed quickly after the German retreat; by the end of 1945, the polder was declared drained again. The floodwater was fresh water, so the land did not have to be desalinated again. Rebuilding of roads and bridges, houses and farms, was greatly facilitated by the experience of building them the first time. Some building materials were re-used: three million roof tiles were salvaged, many by removing them from the roofs of flooded buildings, also lightening the load on their weakened structures. 
The pits remain today, with areas of and . Owing to their size and the infill needed, the dyke was not restored to its original line, passing through where the two flooded pits are, but now went outside this by and with the perimeter road inside them. The replacement dyke was also built to a simpler standard than the original: when first built, this had been a sea dyke protecting from the sea of the Zuider Zee. After the construction of the Afsluitdijk, this was now just the calmer water of the IJsselmeer.
