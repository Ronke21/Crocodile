<text>Sandyford () is a suburb of Dublin, located in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Ireland.

Sandyford Business District makes up much of the suburb and encompasses 4 business parks: Sandyford Business Park, Stillorgan Business Park, Central Park and South County Business Park. Some of the multinational companies based in the area include Google, Facebook, Microsoft and AIB.

==Location and access==
Sandyford is part of the Dáil Éireann constituency of Dublin-Rathdown. Sandyford village (sometimes referred to in Irish as &quot;Taobh na Coille&quot;, meaning &#x27;woodside&#x27;, the townland in which it is situated) is 9 km south of Dublin city centre, just south of the M50 motorway, accessed from the R117 road or M50 junctions 13 and 14, while &quot;Sandyford Business District&quot; is just north of the motorway.

An Aircoach service links the area with Dublin Airport 24 hours a day. Dublin Bus routes 11, 44, 44B, 47, 116 and 118 link the area to other parts of the city. Go-Ahead Ireland also used to operate the 75 through Sandyford until 26 November 2023 when it was replaced with the S8.

===Luas===
The Luas &quot;Green Line&quot; was built through the Business District and the &quot;Kilmacud&quot;, &quot;Stillorgan&quot;, &quot;Sandyford&quot; and &quot;Central Park&quot; stops serve the area, the middle two lying along the eastern edge of the original district. All four of these stops are in the &quot;Sandyford Business District&quot;. Sandyford was the Green Line terminus until the extension to Cherrywood opened in October 2010. The depot for the Green Line is located on the eastern edge of the Business District.

===Metrolink===
While a 2018 public consultation document proposed that the MetroLink project could have its southern terminus at Sandyford, by February 2019 it was proposed that the line would not serve Sandyford and instead stop at Charlemont.

== History==
Sandyford House, a pub in the centre of the village, has been an inn and coach house since the 1690s. For 200 years it was a stopping place for travellers en route to Enniskerry. From 1803 onwards, the Chatham Street to Enniskerry mail coach (a two-hour journey) stopped and deposited the region&#x27;s mail at the inn, which acted as the local post office.

== Sandyford Business District ==

Sandyford Business District is a large business park consisting of more than 700 companies employing over 20,000 people. It was officially opened in 1977 on a site of 120 acres and for 50 years was known as the &quot;Sandyford Industrial Estate&quot;; 85 acres allocated to light industry and the rest to offices.

The area includes several separate business parks and sites, including Sandyford Business Park, Stillorgan Business Park, Central Park, and South County Business Park.

A proposal to establish a &quot;Sandyford Business District&quot; area, to include the core Sandyford Business Park as well as the other areas, resulted in the establishment of the Sandyford Business Improvement District Company (SBID) in January 2017. The area has capacity for 17,500 more employees, 350,000 sq m of commercial floor space and 1,000 residential units.

<text>Tournafulla, or Toornafulla (), is a village in the southwest of County Limerick, Ireland. Tournafulla is a long single-street village. It has a Catholic church, a primary school, three pubs, a community hall and a GAA pitch. As of the 2022 census, the village had a population of 204 people.

==Geography==
By road, Tournafulla is 11 km from Abbeyfeale, 13 km from Newcastle West and 56 km from Limerick city. The village is one half of the parish of Tournafulla/Mountcollins which was formed in 1838. Surrounding parishes include Killeedy to the east, Monagea to the northeast, Templeglantine to the north, Abbeyfeale to the west, Meelin/Rockchapel, County Cork to the south and Brosna, County Kerry to the southwest. It is surrounded by hills to the north and the Mullaghareirk Mountains to the south. Woods covered most of Tournafulla until the 17th century and Irish was still the main language up until the 1910s.

The three counties of Limerick, Cork and Kerry converge at a point in the parish of Tournafulla/Mountcollins. A plaque has been placed at the River Feale to mark this point. Within a few miles of the parish are the villages of Rockchapel, County Cork, and Brosna, which is the converging point of the three counties.

There is minimal public transport. There are occasional Local Link buses to Newcastle West.

===Townlands===
There are twenty townlands in the Tournafulla/Mountcollins parish:

Halla Tadhg Gaelach, the local community centre was officially opened in 2001. Partly funded by the people of Turnafulla to the amount of £200,000, it was dedicated to the local poet Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin. The hall hosts music classes, indoor bowls, meetings and cards while on a monthly basis, there is a ceili.

==Sport and culture==
The local hurling club is Tournafulla GAA. The club was founded in 1900 and a year later club man Tim Doody won an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship with London. Séamus Horgan was the goalkeeper on the Limerick team that won the 1973 All-Ireland, Limerick&#x27;s last, until 2018. The club won many West Senior Hurling titles and built up a close rivalry with neighbours Killeedy. Tour reached the County Senior Hurling Championship final in 1979, but lost to Patrickswell. The club currently compete at Junior A level and footballers from the area play with Mountcollins who are currently Intermediate.

Tournafulla is located in the Sliabh Luachra area of Irish traditional music around the Cork, Limerick and Kerry borders.

Céilithe are held every few weeks in Halla Tadhg Gaelach in Tournafulla.

==Wind turbines==
Airtricity installed an 18-turbine, 27 MW wind farm in Tournafulla, which was installed in two phases between 2006 and 2008.
Phase one consists of a 5-turbine, 7.5 MW wind farm which will provide power for over 4,500 homes, mitigating around 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. Phase two consists of a further 13 turbines which will provide power for over 10,000 homes, mitigating around 44,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.

==Notable people==

*Saint Ita was born in County Waterford around 480. She founded a monastery at Cluain Chreadhail, present day Killeedy, and became known as Brigid of Munster. An old legend was that she once cursed the people of Tournafulla when she was taking her donkeys to the monastery farm at Seeconglass near Mountcollins. The people of Tournafulla set their dogs on her donkeys who ran away. Upon catching up with her donkeys, she discovered that one of the donkeys was lame from a thorn stuck in its foot. St. Ita removed it and planted it near her convent where it grew into a thorn bush. It is alleged that her footprint, and that of her donkey, were left near where the Allaghaun and Skule rivers meet in Upper Tournafulla and those with ailments could be cured once they placed their feet in the footprints.
* Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin (c. 1715 – 1795), 18th century composer of both Christian poetry and Irish bardic poetry in Munster Irish.

<doc id="1034902" wikidata="Q4943208" url="?curid=1034902" title="Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts">
<text>Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (BTWHSPVA) is a public secondary school located in the Arts District of downtown Dallas, Texas, United States. Booker T. Washington HSPVA enrolls students in grades 9-12 and is the Dallas Independent School District&#x27;s arts magnet school (thus, it is often locally referred to simply as Arts Magnet). Many accomplished performers and artists have been educated in the school, including Norah Jones, Erykah Badu, Adario Strange, Valarie Rae Miller, Edie Brickell, Kennedy Davenport, Sandra St. Victor, Roy Hargrove, Scott Westerfeld, and Cecil Eugene Moore Jr. Baseball Hall of Famer Ernie Banks is among the most notable graduates of the school previous to its conversion to the Arts Magnet.

==History==

In 1892, Dallas established its first high school for African-American pupils. In 1911, the school was enlarged and named the Dallas Colored High School. The school was moved in 1922 to larger quarters, designed by famed Dallas architects Lang and Witchell, and renamed Booker T. Washington High School, after the African-American education pioneer Booker T. Washington. For many years, it was the only Dallas high school that allowed students of color.

In 1939, Wilmer-Hutchins Colored High School of the Wilmer-Hutchins ISD burned down in a fire. Afterwards, African-American WHISD students were sent to DISD high schools for &quot;colored&quot; people such as Washington.

In 1942, teacher Thelma Paige Richardson sued the Dallas School District, demanding equalization of pay based upon tenure and merit; the school district denied that any discrimination was taking place. Richardson, with the help of the NAACP, won the case, increasing general awareness of discrimination in the public school system.

In 1952, it was enlarged yet again, and given the new name as Booker T. Washington Technical High School.

In 1976, the school was repurposed as the Arts Magnet at Booker T. Washington High School, inheriting and expanding the magnet-school curricula that had been in place in the Performing Arts and Visual Arts clusters of Skyline High School&#x27;s Career Development Center since 1970. The Arts Magnet became a prototype for magnet schools across the country. The repurposing was part of the federal court desegregation orders that created the magnet school system in Dallas ISD (&quot;Tasby v. Estes&quot;). Paul Baker was selected by Superintendent Estes as founding director of the school.

The neighborhood surrounding Washington has evolved into the Dallas Arts District. The main school building was designated an official Dallas Landmark in 2006.

In 2008, the building was enlarged a third time when a new $65-million facility designed by Brad Cloepfil of Allied Works Architecture, was completed. The expansion preserved the historic main building.

==Statistics==
The attendance rate for students at the school is 96%, equal with the state average; 32% of the students at Washington are economically disadvantaged, 2% enroll in special education, 31% enroll in gifted and talent programs, and 1% are considered &quot;limited English proficient.&quot;
The class of 2017 managed to receive over $60 million in offered scholarships and grants.

The ethnic makeup of the school is 39% White American, 23% African American, 32% Hispanic American, 3% Asian American/Pacific Islander American, 3% multiracial, and 1% American Indian/Alaskan Native.

The average class sizes at Washington are 20 students for English, 27 for foreign language, 19 for math, 22 for science, and 25 for social studies.

<doc id="1034915" wikidata="Q771434" url="?curid=1034915" title="Opus, Greece">
<text>Opus ( or Ὀπόεις) was an ancient Greek city that was the chief city of a tribe of Locri, who were called from this place the Opuntian Locrians, and the territory, the Opuntian Locris.

It was located on the coast of mainland Greece opposite Euboea, perhaps at modern Atalanti. Its harbor was at Kynos. It stood at the head of the Opuntian Gulf, a little inland, being 15 &quot;stadia&quot; from the shore according to Strabo, or only a mile according to Livy. Opus was believed to be one of the most ancient towns in Greece. Pindar&#x27;s ninth Olympian ode concerns Opus. It was said to have been founded by Opus, a son of Locrus and Protogeneia; and in its neighbourhood Deucalion and Pyrrha were reported to have resided. It was the native city of Patroclus, and it is mentioned in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships as one of the Locrian towns whose troops were led by Ajax the Lesser, son of Oileus the king of Locris, in the &quot;Iliad&quot; There were games called Aiantea and an altar at Opus in honor of Ajax.

During the flourishing period of Greek history, it was regarded as the chief city of the eastern Locrians, for the distinction between the Opuntii and Epicnemidii is not made either by Herodotus, Thucydides, or Polybius. Even Strabo, from whom the distinction is chiefly derived, in one place describes Opus as the capital of the Epicnemidii; and the same is confirmed by Pliny and Stephanus of Byzantium. The Opuntii joined Leonidas with all their forces at the Battle of Thermopylae, and sent seven ships to the Greek fleet at Battle of Artemisium (480 BCE). Subsequently they belonged to the anti-Athenian party in Greece. Accordingly, after the conquest of Boeotia by the Athenians, which followed the Battle of Oenophyta, in 456 BCE, the Athenians carried off 100 of the richest Opuntians as hostages. In the Peloponnesian War the Opuntian privateers annoyed the Athenian trade, and it was in order to check them that the Athenians fortified the small island of Atalanta off the Opuntian coast. In the war between Antigonus and Cassander, Opus espoused the cause of the latter, and was therefore besieged by Ptolemy, the general of Antigonus. In 198 BCE, during the Second Macedonian War they went over to the Romans.

The site of Opus is near the modern town of Atalanti.

<doc id="1034923" wikidata="Q3074587" url="?curid=1034923" title="Barrie Flyers">
<text>The Barrie Flyers were a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey Association from 1945 to 1960, from Barrie, Ontario. The Flyers played home games at the Barrie Arena from 1945 to 1960.

==History==
The Barrie Flyers junior team was founded in 1945 by Leighton &quot;Hap&quot; Emms. The franchise was soon affiliated with the Boston Bruins of the NHL. Barrie quickly became a powerhouse in the OHA. They appeared in the Memorial Cup three times, losing the first time in 1948, then winning twice, in 1951 and 1953. The Emms family relocated the team to Niagara Falls in 1960 where the team continued to win and played for 12 seasons, then relocated to Sudbury to become the Sudbury Wolves.

===1948 Memorial Cup===
Barrie won the right to play for the cup by defeating the Windsor Spitfires for the OHA championship, and the Montreal Nationales to win the Richardson Trophy as eastern Canadian representatives.

The Flyers were runners up for the Memorial Cup in 1948 played at Maple Leaf Gardens. They were swept by the Port Arthur West End Bruins (now Thunder Bay) in a best-of-seven series.

The series was very physical and bitter between the teams. After the third game, Emms threatened that the Flyers would not continue to play without a change in referees. The series ultimately continued with the same referees.

 Game 1 Port Arthur 10 vs. Barrie 8
 Game 2 Port Arthur 8 vs. Barrie 1
 Game 3 Port Arthur 5 vs. Barrie 4
 Game 4 Port Arthur 9 vs. Barrie 8 (OT)

===1951 Memorial Cup===
Barrie won the OHA championship defeating the Toronto Marlboros.

Canadian Amateur Hockey Association vice-president W. B. George oversaw the Flyers versus Quebec Citadels series for the George Richardson Memorial Trophy, to represent Eastern Canada in the 1951 Memorial Cup playoffs. When the Citadels refused to play game five in Barrie, George gave them an ultimatum to play or forfeit the series. Quebec decided to play too late to arrive by train, but arrived half an hour late after flying. George scheduled game seven on neutral ice at Maple Leaf Gardens, despite protests from Flyers&#x27; coach Hap Emms who claimed that his team only agreed to resume the series if game seven was played in Barrie.

The Flyers won the Memorial Cup in 1951 played at Winnipeg and Brandon, Manitoba. They swept the Winnipeg Monarchs in a best-of-seven series.

 Game 1 Barrie 5 vs. Winnipeg 1
 Game 2 Barrie 5 vs. Winnipeg 1
 Game 3 Barrie 4 vs. Winnipeg 3
 Game 4 Barrie 9 vs. Winnipeg 5

===1953 Memorial Cup===
Barrie won the right to play for the cup by defeating the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors for the OHA championship. The Flyers won the Memorial Cup in 1953 played at Winnipeg and Brandon, Manitoba. They defeated the St. Boniface Canadiens in a best-of-seven series.

 Game 1 Barrie 6 vs. St. Boniface 4
 Game 2 Barrie 6 vs. St. Boniface 3
 Game 3 Barrie 7 vs. St. Boniface 5
 Game 4 Barrie 4 vs. St. Boniface 7
 Game 5 Barrie 6 vs. St. Boniface 1

==Championships==
The Barrie Flyers were a dominant team during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and one of a few clubs to win multiple Memorial Cup championships. The Flyers won the Ontario championship 4 times, the Eastern Canadian championship 3 times, and the national championship twice.

<text>A comparison of the differences between baseball and softball can be made as softball is directly descended from baseball. An observer of one game would find the other very similar, but there are several important rule differences.

Fastpitch softball is more popular in competitive leagues, especially at the college and international tournament levels, while slow pitch is more popular in recreational leagues where the relative skill levels of different players may vary widely. The different rules of slowpitch can be viewed as maintaining a competitive balance for less skilled players by eliminating certain strategies (e.g., base stealing and bunting) which require a high level of skill to counter. Additionally, recreational leagues may impose their own ground rules, either for competitive balance or to meet local constraints (e.g., a time limit may be imposed on a game to ensure multiple games can be played in one day).
A regulation softball is significantly larger than a regulation baseball. A softball measures between 11.88 and 12.13 inches in circumference and weighs between 6.25 and 7.00 ounces; a baseball measures between 9.00 and 9.25 inches in circumference and weighs between 5.00 and 5.25 ounces.

<text>Dario Floreano (born 1964 in San Daniele del Friuli, Italy) is a Swiss-Italian roboticist and engineer. He is Director of the Laboratory of Intelligent System (LIS) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland and was the founding director of the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics.

==Education and career==
Floreano received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Trieste with a major in visual psychophysics in 1988. In 1989, he joined the Italian National Research Council in Rome as research fellow. He received a master&#x27;s degree in computer sciences with a specialisation in neural computation from the University of Stirling in 1992. In 1995, he earned a PhD in artificial intelligence and robotics from the University of Trieste. Following a position as Chief Scientific Officer at Cognitive Technology Laboratory Ltd, he joined the EPFL in 1996 as group leader in the Department of Computer Science. In 2000, Floreano was first named Assistant Professor, then in 2005 Associate Professor and in 2010 Full Professor of Intelligent Systems at EPFL&#x27;s School of Engineering. He was the founding director of the Swiss National Center of Competence in Robotics, which ran for 12 years, between 2010 and 2022. Floreano was named &quot;AI influencer in Switzerland&quot; in 2021. Since 2022, Floreano is a Fellow of the European Center for Living Technologies (ECLT) and since 2023 a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). He also currently serves as an Advisor Board Member for the ELLIS Tübingen Institute for Machine Learning and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.

==Research==
Floreano is interested in design principles of biologically-inspired intelligent systems with emphasis on the interplay between artificial intelligence, embodiment, and the environment. Over the past 20 years, he has put significant effort into understanding and designing small aerial machines with biologically-inspired perception, morphology, and behaviour that can be operated in novel ways by, and around, humans.

One of the key research avenues explored in Floreano laboratory is the field of drone perception and design, with several contributions to the design and autonomous control of aerial swarms. In earlier work, Floreano demonstrated the world’s first team of 10 fixed-wing drones capable of coordinated outdoor flight by means of novel control algorithms that relied only on local radio communication among neighbouring drones: an algorithm based on ant-colony exploration and an algorithm based on evolutionary algorithms. He then used the 10 fixed-wing drones to study Reynold’s flocking algorithms and showed that the vehicle agility and communication range among the drones significantly affected swarm cohesion. Dario Floreano also proposed novel mechanical design and control methods for exploration of buildings by drone swarms: these drones were designed to perch on ceilings for energy saving, and detecting and communicating with other drones. These algorithms and drones, a.k.a. &quot;eyebots&quot;, were successfully demonstrated in synergetic operation with a swarm of terrestrial robots (&quot;footbots&quot;) and manipulating robots (&quot;handbots&quot;) in a mission aimed at finding and retrieving a book placed on a shelf in a room. Floreano and his team later also studied sound-based swarming and have shown that a quadcopter equipped with a microphone array could detect the range and bearing of another emitting high-frequency chirps. In most recent work, Floreano developed a method for vision-based aerial swarms, whereby drones use onboard cameras to detect each other and autonomously coordinate their own motion with swarm algorithms, showing that drones can safely navigate in an outdoor environment despite substantial background clutter and difficult lighting conditions. At the same time, Floreano&#x27;s team was able to demonstrate autonomous swarming through cluttered environments with model predictive control, where their approach improved the speed, order and safety of the swarm, independently of the environment layout, whilst being scalable in swarm speed and inter-agent distance.

In parallel to the design and autonomous control of aerial swarms, Dario Floreano has been studying body-machine interfaces for more intuitive and immersive tele-robotic operation of drones. His team developed a novel BoMI method to automatically map spontaneous human gestures aimed at interacting with robotic devices. Floreano also developed a soft exoskeleton, called a &quot;FlyJacket&quot;, coupled with virtual reality goggles and smart gloves to allow non-expert persons to naturally control a drone in search and rescue missions. Floreano&#x27;s &quot;FlyJacket&quot; solution was tested by nearly 500 persons at public demonstrations in Lausanne, Zurich, London and Boston. More recently, Floreano and his team showed that haptic feedback is effective at improving BoMI with a drone. His team also developed fabric-based wearable clutches to train humans in more challenging drone teleoperation tasks. This method used haptic feedback to restrain elbow motion and make users aware of their errors, allowing them to consciously learn to prevent errors from occurring. Furthermore, Floreano is interested in studying the effectiveness of different viewpoints in robotic teleoperation with Virtual Reality displays and has developed a machine learning method for extracting the BoMI for drone operation, which showed preliminary results on learning to use hand gestures for steering a swarm in third-person view.

Current work at the LIS also investigates avian-inspired drones, which can morph both their wing and tail surfaces by folding feathers and changing sweep angles in order to improve flight capabilities. Studies have indicated that wing and tail morphing strategy and their synergy enhance the flight agility, maneuverability, stability, and energy efficiency. Other avian-inspired systems being developed by Dario Floreano and his team include mechanisms for perching and terrestrial locomotion.

Another line of research in the Floreano lab has focussed on soft and self-organizing robots. Floreano has studied the design and manufacture of multi-cellular soft robots and developed new functional materials for these applications. His team also studies various aspects of tensegrity robotic systems, which includes modular design, development of manufacturing techniques, and investigation of functional materials. Amongst other examples, Floreano and his team work on new designs for a soft tensegrity robots, which could roll and jump, promising potential applications in disaster mitigation or space exploration. Other designs have included a biomimetic tensegrity fish-like robot, with potential in underwater exploration, inspection and rescue. Most recently, Floreano has been interested in the variable stiffness capabilities of tensegrity systems, which would incorporate novel technologies based on smart materials and elaborate manufacturing techniques. For example, he developed variable stiffness cables based on low melting point alloy (LMPA) smart materials, which could be toggled between rigid and soft states of tensegrity modules. His team also proposed a design for dual stiffness ball joint connections that can switch between a rigid and compliant connection, which were used to design a tensegrity-based spine structure. Another recent example involves dual stiffness rod elements, which can be integrated in the design of robotic joints for rovers and drones to increase their impact and collision resilience. In a related line of research, Floreano looks at the coevolution of the morphology of tensegrity robots, where he studies the influence of the form and stiffness of tensegrity modules on the evolution of the body and the brain of tensegrity robots. Floreano and his team showed how different morphology, control and locomotion strategies could be obtained based on varying stiffness of the tensegrity modules.

Dario Floreano has published hundreds of peer-reviewed articles, tens of patents, as well as five books on neural networks, evolutionary robotics, bio-inspired artificial intelligence, bio-inspired flying robots, and most recently on &quot;How Intelligent Machines Will Shape Our Future&quot;. In 2017, Floreano was featured by &quot;The Economist&quot; in a centre-page portrait as a pioneer in evolutionary robotics and aerial robotics. He was co-founder and member of the Board of Directors of the International Society for Artificial Life, Inc., member of the Board of Governors of the International Society for Neural Networks, Advisory Board member of the Future and Emerging Technology division of the European Commission, and founding members and vice-chair of the General Agenda Council on Robotics of the World Economic Forum.

<text>Graham Stuart Thomas (3 April 1909 – 17 April 2003) was an English horticulturist, who is likely best known for his work with garden roses, his restoration and stewardship of over 100 National Trust gardens and for writing 19 books on gardening, many of which remain classics today. However, as he states in the Preface to his outstanding book, The Rock Garden and its Plants: From Grotto to Alpine House, &quot;My earliest enthusiasms in gardening were for...alpines.&quot; p8

In his obituary in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Clair Martin, rose curator of Huntington Botanical Gardens said: &quot;Thomas set about preserving the heritage of old roses when many of them were on the verge of extinction&quot;.

==Early life==
Graham Stuart Thomas was born in Cambridge into a family of keen amateur gardeners and musicians. His father William Richard Thomas was a clerk to Cambridge University syndicate. He is said to have developed his interest in plants at the age of six, when he was given a fuchsia as a gift. On another occasion, he spent a birthday present of half a crown buying alpine plants on Cambridge Market. By the age of eight. he had decided to make gardening his career.

At 17, he joined Cambridge University Botanic Garden, which enabled him to also attend university lectures on horticulture and botany. These lectures were his only formal education in the field of horticulture, although as a member of staff at the botanic garden he built up a practical and theoretical knowledge that would become the foundation of his career. One of his earliest design projects was working on the rose garden there.

==Horticultural career==
In 1930, Thomas joined the then famous Six Hills Nursery in Stevenage, working under alpine expert Clarence Elliott. The following year he became foreman at T. Hilling &amp; Co (Hillings), a renowned 300-acre nursery near Chobham, Surrey.

It was while working at Hillings that Thomas met the formidable garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, then aged 88, when he wrote her a letter and she invited him for a cup of tea and a chat about gardening. She became a mentor to the young gardener, passing on her theories of garden design as an art. It was around this time that Thomas began to collect old shrub and climbing rose varieties, many of which had fallen out of favour because they only flowered once during the season.

Thomas became partner at Sunningdale Nurseries – then the most revered nursery in the country – with Jim Russell. The partners became known for planting schemes that focused on form and foliage, as much as flowers. At Sunningdale, Thomas established his entire collection of roses. It was here also that he began introducing new or rediscovered garden plants – notable introductions from this period include the perennial Geranium &#x27;Claridge Druce&#x27;. While Thomas would become associated with many other projects, he would remain a director of the Sunningdale nursery until 1971.

Thomas&#x27;s first important publication about roses was a booklet called &quot;The Manual of Shrub Roses&quot;, describing all the varieties, with advice on cultivation. In the foreword he described the booklet&#x27;s aim as: &quot;To bring forth these lovely things from retirement.&quot; His classic books on roses – &quot;Old Shrub Roses&quot; (1955), &quot;Shrub Roses Of Today&quot; (1962) and &quot;Climbing Roses Old And New&quot; (1965) followed and cemented his influence. They also provided much-needed information about the history and extent of the genus at a time when old varieties were being overshadowed by their repeat flowering and showier cousins hybrid teas and floribundas.

==Work with the National Trust==
Thomas began an informal association with the National Trust in the late 1940s, initially working at Hidcote Manor when it passed to the Trust in 1948. The relationship was formalised when he became its official gardens adviser in 1955. This was a relationship that was to continue for the succeeding 20 years and gave him the opportunity to work with a vast array of plants in spectacular historic settings, such as Sissinghurst Castle and Mount Stewart. It is Mottisfont Abbey – a creation that he himself described as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; – where his rose collection found its final home, and where his garden design skills can be best appreciated.

He also assisted with the 1968 restoration of the Sezincote gardens. 

==Gardening accolades and legacy==
In 1975, Thomas received the OBE for his work with the National Trust. Other awards included the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Veitch Memorial Medal in 1966 and Victoria Medal of Honour in 1968. He received a Gold Medal from the RHS for his paintings and drawings, the Dean Hole Medal from the Royal National Rose Society and the Garden Writers&#x27; Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.

In addition to his garden designs, books and illustrations, Thomas is remembered by name in various garden plants, including the vigorous honeysuckle &quot;Lonicera periclymenum&quot; &#x27;Graham Thomas&#x27; and the 1983 David Austin rose &#x27;Graham Thomas&#x27;.

He influenced a number of other notable rose growers, including Peter Beales, who worked with him for a short time at Hillings.

<doc id="1034953" wikidata="Q6251168" url="?curid=1034953" title="John Okada">
<text>John Kozo Okada (, September 23, 1923 – February 20, 1971) was a Japanese American novelist known for his critically acclaimed novel &quot;No-No Boy&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Seattle, Okada was a student at the University of Washington during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Okada had to interrupt his studies, and he and his family were among thousands of American citizens interned at Minidoka War Relocation Center in 1942 as a result of Executive Order 9066.

Okada was taken out of the internment camp and recruited to the United States Army Air Forces after he completed a loyalty questionnaire which asked him to &quot;forswear allegiance&quot; to the Emperor of Japan. He served as a Japanese translator, overflying Japanese forces in the Pacific and translating intercepted Japanese communications.

After the war, Okada returned to his educational pursuits, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in library science from the University of Washington, as well as a master&#x27;s degree in English from Columbia University. In 1956, Okada completed the manuscript for his novel &quot;No-No Boy&quot;, which was published the following year.

Over the years, Okada worked several different jobs including as a librarian and technical writer. Okada died of a heart attack on February 20, 1971, at the age of 47. He was survived by his wife Dorothy, as well as a son and a daughter. He is interred at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park in Seattle.

Okada&#x27;s younger brother Frank Okada was a noted abstract expressionist painter.

==Literary works==
Okada&#x27;s only completed and published novel, &quot;No-No Boy&quot; (1957) deals with the aftermath of the Japanese American internment during World War II, Japanese-American identity, and how this event divided the Japanese American population after the war. He explored feelings among Japanese nationals, some of whom still held dreams of a return to Japan, and among their native-born American children, who felt conflicted about their identity but identified with the United States. Some of both generations were intensely bitter about their treatment in being interned during the war, in addition to the substantial economic and social losses they had suffered. John Okada&#x27;s “No-No Boy” captures the injustice of incarcerating Japanese-Americans during World War II — and serves as a warning today for our own fractured society.

The protagonist is a native-born American of Japanese descent who answered &quot;No&quot; on two important questions posed by the government: would he vow loyalty and would he enlist in the Army? Those who answered &quot;no&quot; were sentenced to two years in prison. On returning to Seattle after prison, he has to confront veterans whom he knew from before the war, some of whom were wounded and all of whom look down on him. He also struggles with his parents, as his mother clings to the belief that Japan did not lose the war and eventually loses her sanity.

The novel did not get much notice, coming too soon after the war for people to want to explore the harshness of his portrayal and confrontation with hard questions. Okada&#x27;s novel was rediscovered by some writers from Los Angeles in 1976, who tracked down his wife to meet her and see if she had any of his manuscripts. She had struggled after his death and, unable to find a publisher interested in his next manuscript and disappointed at the rejection of his papers by UCLA, she burned everything: novel, notes, letters, etc.

In his introduction to the new 1976 edition of the novel, Lawson Fusao Inada writes of meeting Okada&#x27;s wife, Dorothy, in La Grande, Oregon 1976:

Dorothy is a truly wonderful person. It hurt to have her tell us that &quot;John would have liked you.&quot; It hurt to have her tell us that &quot;you two are the first ones who ever came to see him about his work.&quot; It hurt to have her tell us that she recently burned his &quot;other novel about the Issei, which we both researched and which was almost finished.&quot; It hurt to have her tell us that &quot;the people I tried to contact about it never answered so when I moved I burned it, because &quot;I have him in my heart&quot;.&quot; [...] You could say John was &quot;ahead of his time,&quot; that he was born too early and died too young.
In 2018, Frank Abe, Greg Robinson, and Floyd Cheung published &quot;John Okada: The Life and Rediscovered Writings of the Author of&quot; No-No Boy. This volume, which received an American Book Award in 2019, includes a substantial biography authored by Abe and based on interviews with Okada&#x27;s family members and friends. The rediscovered works include a poem that Okada wrote during the night of the attack on Pearl Harbor entitled &quot;I Must Be Strong,&quot; a play about the US occupation of Japan which was produced at the Tryout Theater in 1946, five short stories which were published in the &quot;Northwest Times&quot; in 1947, and two satirical essays about the military-industrial complex written during his stint as a technical writer at Hughes Aircraft Company between 1958 and 1961.

==Legacy and honors==
The Asian-American ethnic-theme dorm at Stanford University is named Okada in John Okada&#x27;s honor.

<text>Guarani is a municipality located in the Zona da Mata within the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The population is 8,918 (2020 est.) in an area of 264 km2. The average elevation is 440m above the sea level within the urban limits, reaching up to 1,434m in the mountainous area located in the outskirts. The town was named after the biggest native tribe which dwelt in Brazil before the Colonial Period, the Guaranis.

Guarani&#x27;s most iconic landscape is the Catholic Parish of the Divine Holy Ghost located in one of the highest points of the town. Surrounded by a small green garden and Marechal Deodoro da Fonseca Square and gathered with astonishing paintings as well as sculptures representing New Testament&#x27;s passages the church is an attractive building which reminds the baroque churches of older cities, spread throughout Minas Gerais state, settled in the seventeenth century. However, the area of Guarani was only settled in the 1830s, and it became a municipality on March 25, 1914, by separation from Pomba.

<doc id="1034969" wikidata="Q961466" url="?curid=1034969" title="Levelling">
<text>Levelling or leveling (American English; see spelling differences) is a branch of surveying, the object of which is to establish or verify or measure the height of specified points relative to a datum. It is widely used in geodesy and cartography to measure vertical position with respect to a vertical datum, and in construction to measure height differences of construction artifacts.

==Optical levelling==
Optical levelling, also known as spirit levelling and differential levelling, employs an &quot;optical level&quot;, which consists of a precision telescope with crosshairs and stadia marks. The cross hairs are used to establish the level point on the target, and the stadia allow range-finding; stadia are usually at ratios of 100:1, in which case one metre between the stadia marks on the &quot;level staff&quot; (or &quot;rod&quot;) represents 100metres from the target.

The complete unit is normally mounted on a &quot;tripod&quot;, and the telescope can freely rotate 360° in a horizontal plane. The surveyor adjusts the instrument&#x27;s level by coarse adjustment of the tripod legs and fine adjustment using three precision levelling screws on the instrument to make the rotational plane horizontal. The surveyor does this with the use of a &quot;bull&#x27;s eye level&quot; built into the instrument mount.

===Procedure===
The surveyor looks through the eyepiece of telescope while an assistant holds a vertical level staff which is graduated in inches or centimeters. The level staff is placed vertically using a level, with its foot on the point for which the level measurement is required. The telescope is rotated and focused until the level staff is plainly visible in the crosshairs. In the case of a high accuracy manual level, the fine level adjustment is made by an altitude screw, using a high accuracy bubble level fixed to the telescope. This can be viewed by a mirror whilst adjusting or the ends of the bubble can be displayed within the telescope, which also allows assurance of the accurate level of the telescope whilst the sight is being taken. However, in the case of an automatic level, altitude adjustment is done automatically by a suspended prism due to gravity, as long as the coarse levelling is accurate within certain limits. When level, the staff graduation reading at the crosshairs is recorded, and an identifying mark or marker placed where the level staff rested on the object or position being surveyed.

A typical procedure for a linear track of levels from a known datum is as follows. Set up the instrument within of a point of known or assumed elevation. A rod or staff is held vertical on that point and the instrument is used manually or automatically to read the rod scale. This gives the height of the instrument above the starting (backsight) point and allows the height of the instrument (H.I.) above the datum to be computed.
The rod is then held on an unknown point and a reading is taken in the same manner, allowing the elevation of the new (foresight) point to be computed. The difference between these two readings equals the change in elevation, which is why this method is also called &quot;differential levelling&quot;. The procedure is repeated until the destination point is reached. It is usual practice to perform either a complete loop back to the starting point or else close the traverse on a second point whose elevation is already known. The closure check guards against blunders in the operation, and allows residual error to be distributed in the most likely manner among the stations.

Some instruments provide three crosshairs which allow stadia measurement of the foresight and backsight distances. These also allow use of the average of the three readings (3-wire leveling) as a check against blunders and for averaging out the error of interpolation between marks on the rod scale.

The two main types of levelling are single-levelling as already described, and double-levelling (double-rodding). In double-levelling, a surveyor takes two foresights and two backsights and makes sure the difference between the foresights and the difference between the backsights are equal, thereby reducing the amount of error. Double-levelling costs twice as much as single-levelling.

====Turning a level====
When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. Turning is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location.

To &quot;turn&quot; the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed.

The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

== Trigonometric levelling ==
The other standard method of levelling in construction and surveying is called trigonometric levelling, which is preferred when levelling &quot;out&quot; to a number of points from one stationary point. This is done by using a total station, or any other instrument to read the vertical, or zenith angle to the rod, and the change in elevation is calculated using trigonometric functions (see example below). At greater distances (typically 1,000 feet and greater), the curvature of the Earth, and the refraction of the instrument wave through the air must be taken into account in the measurements as well (see section below).

Ex: an instrument at Point A reading to a rod at Point B a zenith angle of &lt; 88°15&#x27;22&quot; (degrees, minutes, seconds of arc) and a slope distance of 305.50 feet not factoring rod or instrument height would be calculated thus:

: cos(88°15&#x27;22&quot;)(305.5)≈ 9.30 ft.,

meaning an elevation change of approximately 9.30 feet in elevation between Points A and B. So if Point A is at 1,000 feet of elevation, then Point B would be at approximately 1,009.30 feet of elevation, as the reference line (0°) for zenith angles is straight up going clockwise one complete revolution, and so an angle reading of less than 90 degrees (horizontal or flat) would be looking uphill and not down (and opposite for angles greater than 90 degrees), and so would gain elevation.

==Refraction and curvature==
The curvature of the earth means that a line of sight that is horizontal at the instrument will be higher and higher above a spheroid at greater distances. The effect may be insignificant for some work at distances under 100 meters. The increase in height of a straight line with distance is:

:formula_1

where R is the radius of the earth.

The line of sight is horizontal at the instrument, but is not a straight line because of atmospheric refraction. The change of air density with elevation causes the line of sight to bend toward the earth.

The combined correction for refraction and curvature is approximately:

:formula_2 or formula_3

For precise work these effects need to be calculated and corrections applied. For most work it is sufficient to keep the foresight and backsight distances approximately equal so that the refraction and curvature effects cancel out. Refraction is generally the greatest source of error in leveling. For short level lines the effects of temperature and pressure are generally insignificant, but the effect of the temperature gradient &quot;dT / dh&quot; can lead to errors.

==Levelling loops and gravity variations==

Assuming error-free measurements, if the Earth&#x27;s gravity field were completely regular and gravity constant, leveling loops would always close precisely:

:formula_4

around a loop. In the real gravity field of the Earth, this happens only approximately; on small loops typical of engineering projects, the loop closure is negligible, but on larger loops covering regions or continents it is not.

Instead of height differences, &quot;geopotential differences&quot; do close around loops:

:formula_5

where formula_6 stands for gravity at the leveling interval &quot;i&quot;. For precise leveling networks on a national scale, the latter formula should always be used.

:formula_7

should be used in all computations, producing geopotential values formula_8 for the benchmarks of the network.

High precision levelling, especially when conducted over long distances as used for the establishment and maintenance of vertical datums, is called geodetic levelling.

==Instruments==
===Classical instruments===
The dumpy level was developed by English civil engineer William Gravatt, while surveying the route of a proposed railway line from London to Dover. More compact and hence both more robust and easier to transport, it is commonly believed that dumpy levelling is less accurate than other types of levelling, but such is not the case. Dumpy levelling requires shorter and therefore more numerous sights, but this fault is compensated by the practice of making foresights and backsights equal.

Precise level designs were often used for large leveling projects where utmost accuracy was required. They differ from other levels in having a very precise spirit level tube and a micrometer adjustment to raise or lower the line of sight so that the crosshair can be made to coincide with a line on the rod scale and no interpolation is required.

===Automatic level===
Automatic levels make use of a &quot;compensator&quot; that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument (to within maybe 0.05 degree). The compensator consists of small prisms suspended from wires inside of the level&#x27;s chassis that are connected together in the shape of a pendulum. This allows for only horizontal light rays to enter, even in cases where the telescope of the instrument is not perfectly plumb.

The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and does not have to re-level it carefully each time they sight on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod to the actual amount of motion instead of leveraging the tilt over the sight distance. Because the level of the instrument only needs to be adjusted once per setup, the surveyor can quickly and easily read as many side-shots as necessary between turns. Three level screws are used to level the instrument, as opposed to the four screws historically found in dumpy levels.

===Laser level===

Laser levels project a beam which is visible and/or detectable by a sensor on the leveling rod. This style is widely used in construction work but not for more precise control work. An advantage is that one person can perform the levelling independently, whereas other types require one person at the instrument and one holding the rod.

The sensor can be mounted on earth-moving machinery to allow automated grading.

<doc id="1034972" wikidata="Q3089228" url="?curid=1034972" title="Natural border">
<text>A natural border is a border between states or their subdivisions which is concomitant with natural formations such as rivers or mountain ranges. The &quot;doctrine of natural boundaries&quot; developed in Western culture in the 18th century being based upon the &quot;natural&quot; ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and developing concepts of nationalism. The similar concept in China developed earlier from natural zones of control.


Natural borders have historically been strategically useful because they are easily defended. Natural borders remain meaningful in modern warfare even though military technology and engineering have somewhat reduced their strategic value.

Expanding until natural borders are reached, and maintaining those borders once conquered, have been a major policy goal for a number of states. For example, the Roman Republic, and later, the Roman Empire expanded continuously until it reached certain natural borders: first the Alps, later the Rhine river, the Danube river and the Sahara desert. From the Middle Ages onwards until the 19th century, France sought to expand its borders towards the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Rhine River.

Natural borders can be a source of territorial disputes when they shift. One such example is the Rio Grande, which defines part of the border between the United States and Mexico, whose movement has led to multiple conflicts.

Natural borders are not to be confused with landscape borders, which are also geographical features that demarcate political boundaries. Although landscape borders, like natural borders, also take forms of forests, water bodies, and mountains, they are manmade instead of natural. Installing a landscape border, usually motivated by demarcating treaty-designated political boundaries, goes against nature by modifying the borderland&#x27;s natural geography. For one, China&#x27;s Song Dynasty built an extensive defensive forest in its northern border to thwart the nomadic Khitan people.

== Criticism ==
In Chapter IV of his 1916 book &quot;The New Europe: Essays in Reconstruction&quot;, British historian Arnold J. Toynbee criticized the concept of natural borders. Specifically, Toynbee criticized this concept as providing a justification for launching additional wars so that countries can attain their natural borders. Toynbee also pointed out how once a country attained one set of natural borders, it could subsequently aim to attain another, further set of natural borders; for instance, the German Empire set its western natural border at the Vosges Mountains in 1871 but during World War I, some Germans began to advocate for even more western natural borders—specifically ones that extend all of the way up to Calais and the English Channel—conveniently justifying the permanent German retention of those Belgian and French territories that Germany had just conquered during World War I. As an alternative to the idea of natural borders, Toynbee proposes making free trade, partnership, and cooperation between various countries with interconnected economies considerably easier so that there would be less need for countries to expand even further—whether to their natural borders or otherwise. In addition, Toynbee advocated making national borders based more on the principle of national self-determination—as in, based on which country the people in a particular area or territory actually wanted to live in.

<doc id="1034980" wikidata="Q5632223" url="?curid=1034980" title="HMS Dumbarton Castle (P265)">
<text>HMS &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; (P265) was an offshore patrol vessel of the British Royal Navy. Her main role was the protection of the offshore assets of the United Kingdom, including oil and gas installations and fisheries out to the limit.

She spent much of her time deployed in the South Atlantic as guard ship, patrolling around the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, alternating with her sister ship . Her long association with the Falkland Islands resulted in the ship&#x27;s company being given permission to add her name to the roll of honour written in white rocks on the hillside opposite Stanley in 2007.

==Design and construction==
The was designed for fisheries protection and oilfield patrol duties in the United Kingdom&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). They were a follow-on to the interim which had been ordered in 1975 when the EEZ was extended to 200 miles, and as a result of initial experience with the Islands, was considerably longer in order to improve seakeeping in heavy seas, with the extra length giving greater speed from the same power as the Islands and allowing a large helicopter deck to be fitted.

&quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was powered by two Ruston 12RK 320 DM diesel engines rated at (with a maximum sustained power of , driving two shafts fitted with controllable pitch propellers. This gave a speed of . The ship had a range of at .

The ship was initially armed with a single Bofors 40 mm L/60 gun, although by 1990 this had been replaced by an Oerlikon 30 mm gun on a DS30B mount. The main armament was supplemented by two 7.62 mm machine guns. A large helicopter deck was fitted aft, suitable for landing a Sea King or Chinook helicopter, but no hangar was provided, as the cost of a permanently embarked helicopter would be more than the cost of the ship. She was fitted with Type 1006 navigation radar, which was supplemented with a Type 994 air/surface search radar in 1986, together with a UAN(1) electronic intercept system (based on the Orange Crop system fitted to the Royal Navy&#x27;s helicopters. The ship had a crew of 6 officers and 39 other ranks, with room for a 25-man detachment of Royal Marines to be carried.

&quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; was laid down at Hall, Russell &amp; Company&#x27;s Aberdeen shipyard as yard number 986 on 25 April 1980 as the second Castle-class patrol vessel. This was in advance of a formal order for the two ships being placed, which did not take place until 8 August that year. She was launched on 3 June 1981, and was completed on 12 March 1982.

==Service==
&quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; commissioned at Rosyth on 26 March 1982, and was assigned the pennant number P265. In April 1982, the Falklands War began when Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands on 2 April. &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; sailed from her base at Rosyth on 26 April for HMNB Portsmouth to be fitted with additional communications equipment and a desalination plant to better suit her to support the British task force sailing to retake the Falklands. &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; left Portsmouth on 1 May, arriving at Ascension Island on 11 May, where she was employed as a despatch vessel, ferrying stores between Ascension and the Task Force, and between warships of the task force. She returned to Rosyth in August 1982. &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; was awarded the battle honour &quot;Falkland Islands 1982&quot; for her service in the war.

Both &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; and sister ship were employed as guardships for the Falklands as well as for more normal fishery protection duties in home waters. In August 1991, &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; relieved &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; at the start of a three-year deployment to the Falklands, and from 1998 to 2000, carried out another three year deployment to the South Atlantic. In 2001, &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; was converted to serve as a command ship for mine countermeasures vessels

&quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; was replaced by the , , in 2007, returning to Portsmouth after her last patrol on 22 November that year.

Both &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; and her sister were sold to Bangladesh in April 2010. &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; left Portsmouth on 21 May 2010 towed by the tug &quot;Multratug 7&quot;, for A&amp;P Group facility in Newcastle upon Tyne for a major regeneration project with her sister ship &quot;Leeds Castle&quot;. The project was completed in December 2010.

In March 2011, &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; and &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; were recommissioned as and of the Bangladesh Navy respectively. On 4 August 2020 BNS &quot;Bijoy&quot;, was damaged in the 2020 Beirut Port Explosions while part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.

<text>Ian Harold Woosnam (born 2 March 1958) is a Welsh professional golfer. Nicknamed &quot;Woosie&quot;, Woosnam was one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; generation of European golfers, all born within 12 months of one another, all of whom have won majors, and made Europe competitive in the Ryder Cup. His peers in this group were Seve Ballesteros, Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, and Sandy Lyle. Woosnam&#x27;s major championship win was at the 1991 Masters Tournament. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Early life==
Woosnam was born in the town of Oswestry, Shropshire in England, and his family lived in the nearby village of St Martin&#x27;s in Shropshire.

==Amateur career==
Woosnam started playing at the Llanymynech Golf Club, which straddles the Wales-England border. He is short for a male golfer at , but he is a powerful hitter. He played as an amateur in regional competitions in the English county of Shropshire alongside Sandy Lyle.

== Professional career ==
Woosnam turned professional in 1976 and first played the European Tour in 1979. Woosnam spent his early years on Tour driving around the continent in a camper van, living on a diet of baked beans to save money. After three modest seasons, his career took off in 1982 when he won the Swiss Open and came eighth on the Order of Merit (prize money list). He also finished in the top ten on the Order of Merit every year from 1983 to 1991 and again in 1993, 1996, and 1997, making thirteen times in all. In 1987 and 1990 he was first, and in the former year he set a world record for global tournament earnings of £1,062,662. He has won 28 official money events on the European Tour and many other events around the world.

Woosnam placed third in the 1986 Open Championship. In 1987, Woosnam was criticised by anti-apartheid campaigners for playing a tournament in Sun City in apartheid South Africa, in contravention of the United Nations cultural moratorium.

In 1991, he reached the top of the Official World Golf Ranking, eventually spending a total of 50 weeks as World Number 1 (7 April 1991 – 21 March 1992). In the same year, he emulated his British rivals, Sandy Lyle and Nick Faldo, by winning the Masters Tournament; the first person representing Wales to ever win a major championship.

After winning the Torras Monte Carlo Golf Open in 1991, Woosnam had a decline in form in the second half of the year and said that he was suffering from exhaustion after playing in too many tournaments across the world. In December 1991, his sterling silver Masters trophy, a $9,000 copy of the original, was stolen from a British train.

Woosnam&#x27;s last official European Tour victory was in the 1997 Volvo PGA Championship. In the late 1990s, his form began to fade, but he nearly made a spectacular comeback at The Open Championship in 2001, when he finished third despite suffering a two-stroke penalty for starting the final round with 15 clubs in his bag instead of the allowable maximum of 14. While his caddie, Miles Byrne, was responsible for this error, Woosnam decided at the time not to dismiss him stating: &quot;It is the biggest mistake he will make in his life. He won&#x27;t do it again. He&#x27;s a good caddie. I am not going to sack him. He&#x27;s a good lad.&quot; Woosnam did dismiss his caddie two weeks later when, after a night drinking on the town, Byrne failed to turn up to tee-time.

Later in 2001, at the age of 43, Woosnam became the oldest player to win the World Match Play Championship (not an official European Tour event at the time) when he beat Pádraig Harrington 2 &amp; 1 in the final. Woosnam also became the first player to capture the trophy in three different decades, having previously won the World Match Play Championship in 1987 and 1990. Woosnam had a record outward nine holes of 28 (-7) in the 2001 final against Harrington, which tied the tournament record of seven successive birdies in a match.

Woosnam was a member of eight consecutive European Ryder Cup teams from 1983 to 1997. Despite not winning a singles match he accumulated an overall record of 14 wins, 12 losses and 5 halves in 31 matches. He was a vice captain for the 2002 European team and was elected as captain for the 2006 Ryder Cup, leading Europe to victory over the U.S. 18½–9½ at the K Club, County Kildare, Ireland.

On 1 June 2008, Woosnam won his first stroke play title in 11 years at the Parkridge Polish Seniors Championship at Kraków Valley Golf and Country Club, finishing with a course record 63. The tournament was his third appearance on European Seniors Tour, which he joined after turning 50 years old in March 2008. Woosnam went on to win the European Seniors Tour Order of Merit that year becoming the only person to have won the Order of Merit on both the European Seniors Tour and the regular European Tour.

==Honours==

* In 1987, Woosnam won BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year awards. He won the award again in 1990 and 1991.
* Woosnam was awarded an OBE in the 2007 New Years Honours List.
* In September 2010, he was inducted to the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Woosnam was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in early 1987.

He appeared in repertory in York and Birmingham 1943–45, and toured India and Burma in a production of Kenneth Horne&#x27;s West End comedy &quot;Love in a Mist&quot; during 1945 with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). He continued in repertory 1946–49, during which time he played a season at St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada.

McCowen made his London debut on 20 April 1950, at the Arts Theatre as Maxim in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Ivanov&quot;, and made his first appearances on the New York City stage at the Ziegfeld Theatre on 19 December 1951, as an Egyptian Guard in &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, and on 20 December 1951, as the Messenger in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Following a series of roles at the Arts and with the Repertory Players, he had rising success as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; at the then New Theatre, Bromley, and appeared as Barnaby Tucker in &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, both 1954.

After appearances as Dr Bird in &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court Martial&quot; at the London Hippodrome in 1956, and Michael Claverton-Ferry in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Elder Statesman&quot;, first at the Edinburgh Festival in 1958, then at the Cambridge Theatre, he joined the Old Vic Company for its 1959–60 season, among several parts taking the title role in &quot;Richard II&quot;, then stayed on for the 1960–61 season to play Mercutio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Oberon in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

McCowen joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in September 1962, appearing at Stratford-upon-Avon playing Antipholus of Syracuse in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; and the Fool to Paul Scofield&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, subsequently appearing in both plays at the Aldwych Theatre in December 1962 – performing these roles again for a British Council tour of the Soviet Union, Europe and the United States from February to June 1964. With the RSC he also played &quot;the gruelling role&quot; of Father Riccardo Fontana in Rolf Hochhuth&#x27;s controversial play &quot;The Representative&quot; at the Aldwych in December 1963.

===Later theatre work===
McCowen enjoyed a career breakthrough at the Mermaid Theatre in April 1968 as Fr. William Rolfe in &quot;Hadrian the Seventh&quot;, winning his first &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award as Best Actor for the London production and a Tony nomination after the transfer to Broadway.

At the Royal Court in August 1970, McCowen was cast to play the title role in Christopher Hampton&#x27;s sophisticated comedy, &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;. If a philanthropist is literally someone who likes people, McCowen&#x27;s Philip was a philologist with a compulsive urge not to hurt people&#x27;s feelings – the inverse of Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. Following enthusiastic reviews the production played to packed houses and transferred to the Mayfair Theatre where it ran for a further three years, making it the Royal Court&#x27;s most successful straight play. McCowen and his co-star Jane Asher went with it to Broadway in March 1971 where he won the 1971 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance.

McCowen&#x27;s next big successes were in National Theatre Company productions at the Old Vic. In February 1973 he co-starred with Diana Rigg in Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; for which he won his second &quot;Evening Standard&quot; award; followed in July 1973 by the role of psychiatrist Martin Dysart (&quot;played on a knife edge of professional skill and personal disgust by McCowen&quot;, according to Irving Wardle reviewing for &quot;The Times&quot;) in the world premiere of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Equus&quot;. McCowen took part in the first professional UK staging of Weill&#x27;s &quot;Street Scene&quot;, at the Palace Theatre, London on 26 April 1987 (as Harry Easter), a charity performance in aid of London Lighthouse conducted by John Owen Edwards.

McCowen devised and directed his own solo performance of the complete text of the St. Mark&#x27;s Gospel, for which he received international acclaim and another Tony nomination. It opened first at the Riverside Studios in January 1978 before beginning a long West End season at the Mermaid Theatre then at the Comedy Theatre. Taking the production to New York, he appeared at the Marymount Manhattan and Playhouse theatres.

Christopher Hampton&#x27;s stage adaptation of George Steiner&#x27;s novel &quot;The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.&quot; at the Mermaid in 1982 gave McCowen a great final speech, an attempted vindication of racial extermination delivered by Adolf Hitler, which for &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Michael Billington was &quot;one of the greatest pieces of acting I have ever seen: a shuffling, grizzled, hunched, baggy figure, yet suggesting the monomaniac power of the Nuremberg Rallies, inhabiting the frail vessel of this old man&#x27;s body.&quot; It was a performance that also won him his third &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Best Actor award, a record equalled only by Laurence Olivier and Paul Scofield.

Two years later, again at the Mermaid, McCowen gave a portrayal of the British poet Rudyard Kipling in a one-man play by Brian Clark, performed in a setting that exactly matched Kipling&#x27;s own study at Bateman&#x27;s (his Jacobean rustic haven in Sussex) &quot;and turning&quot;, as Michael Billington wrote, &quot;an essentially private man into a performer.&quot; McCowen appeared in the play on Broadway and on television for Channel 4.

===Directing===
While preparing to co-star as Vladimir to John Alderton&#x27;s Estragon in Michael Rudman&#x27;s acclaimed production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at the National Theatre in November 1987, McCowen also spent a busy autumn staging Martin Crimp&#x27;s trilogy of short plays &quot;Definitely the Bahamas&quot; at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond upon Thames, having previously enjoyed Crimp&#x27;s style of writing in a BBC radio version of &quot;Three Attempted Acts&quot;. As Charles Spencer wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;As a director McCowen captures both the subtlety and the richness of these three original and beautifully written plays.&quot;

At the Hampstead Theatre in December 1972 he directed a revival of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s wartime London comedy &quot;While the Sun Shines&quot;.

===Film and television===
McCowen made his film debut in &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; released in 1953. His other film credits include roles in &quot;Town on Trial&quot; (1957), &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1958), &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962), &quot;The Witches&quot; (1966), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972), &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot; (1972, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination), &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983) in which he played the opinionated secret service quartermaster, &quot;Q&quot;, named Algynon, &quot;Personal Services &quot; (1987) and &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989).

McCowen&#x27;s television roles included the BBC&#x27;s four-part adaptation of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Angel Pavement&quot; (1958), and his one-man stage performance of &quot;The Gospel According to Saint Mark&quot;, transferred to television by Thames for Easter 1979.

McCowen appeared alongside Maureen Lipman and Arthur Askey performing comic monologues in &quot;The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog&quot;, which was recorded 1982, and broadcast by Channel 4 in 1983.

McCowen appeared in the BBC Television Shakespeare series as Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and as Chorus in &quot;Henry V&quot;. In 1984 and 1985 McCowen starred in the ten episodes of the short-lived television series &quot;Mr Palfrey of Westminster&quot; as a &quot;spy catcher&quot; working for British intelligence under the direction of a female boss (played by Caroline Blakiston).

McCowen&#x27;s one-man performance as Rudyard Kipling was broadcast on television in 1984. His later appearances included playing Albert Speer and Rudolf Hess in the BBC docudramas &quot;The World Walk&quot; in 1984 and 1985, and as astronomer Sir Frank Dyson in &quot;Longitude&quot; in 2000. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1989, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at the Strand Theatre in London. He was annoyed when no mention was made of his long-term male partner, fellow actor Geoffrey Burridge and threatened to stop the show from being broadcast. The dispute was resolved by the host, Michael Aspel, adding a voiceover over the final credits acknowledging the relationship.

McCowen was the narrator in a recording of Gerhard&#x27;s cantata (after Camus) &quot;The Plague&quot;, with the Washington National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Antal Doráti in 1973, and also took the part of the Narrator in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, with Peter Pears, Kerstin Meyer and the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Georg Solti; the music for this was recorded in March 1976, his spoken part later and the first issue was in February 1978.

===Literature===
McCowen published his first volume of autobiography, &quot;Young Gemini&quot; in 1979, followed a year later by &quot;Double Bill&quot; (Elm Tree Books).

<text>Guaratinguetá is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 122,505 (2020 est.) in an area of 752.64 km2. It is located in the region of Vale do Paraíba; prominent individuals from the area include Saint Frei Galvão, Brazilian President Rodrigues Alves and the cardiologist Dr Euryclides de Jesus Zerbini. The name of the city derives from the words in the Tupi language: &quot;gûyra&quot; (heron), &quot;tinga&quot; (white) and &quot;etá&quot; (), resulting in &quot;Gûyrating&#x27;etá&quot; (meeting of white herons).

The municipality contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraíba do Sul river.

==History==
Since early times, Guaratinguetá was known by the Indians of the region for the abundance of herons that lived on the edges of the Paraíba do Sul river. The first Portuguese settlers arrived at the end of the 16th century, after rumours of mineral wealth hidden in Serra da Mantiqueira, in the lands known today as Minas Gerais. The settlement of the region began in 1628, with the donation of lands by Jacques Felix and his children. On June 13, 1630, construction began of a chapel, that was registered first in Livro-Tombo da Matriz of Santo Antonio.

On February 13, 1651, by intervention of Captain Domingos Leme, a village was raised for the Saint Antonio of Guaratinguetá, with the opening of the main road. By tradition, the pillory was also raised. During the 18th century, Guaratinguetá became the main point of supply for the gold miners coming from Minas Gerais as commerce on the route developed. During that period, the foreign travellers who had passed through there perpetuated the image of Guaratinguetá, as much in books as in paintings, and the village grew. The few narrow streets were filled by people at the end of the century on Sundays, holidays, and religious celebrations.
Guaratinguetá entered a more religious significance in 1717. In 1757, it held the second biggest party in Louvor to a Saint in the city. Diogo Antônio de Feijó, future priest and regent of the empire of Dom Pedro II, studied in Guaratinguetá with the Manoel Frank Gonçalves during the years of 1795 and 1798.

In the 19th century, Guaratinguetá grew in coffee production, at the same time as it suffered a decline of sugar production. During the Brazilian independence, Dom Pedro I spend the night in the city on August 18 of 1822, stimulating more economic development, and more growth in the coffee industry. The village became a city in 1844, and was incorporated in 1852. During this time, coffee was used as a hard currency, and the daily life of the city was changed forever. It raised man power in the farms, the city grew, and the children of the farmers were sent to study. Commercial merchandise came by donkey to the port of Parati and grew even more.

Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves, born on July 7, 1848, was the council member of the empire, a member of the Chamber of Deputies, president of the Province of São Paulo and twice President of the Republic (Brazil). He was inaugurated by a daily &quot;O Mosaico&quot;, Development came with the iron horse in 1877 with the construction made way for the immigrants who came to substitute man power. The end of the 19th century marked the inauguration of a theater Carlos Gomes, Da Ponte Metálica, the Banco Popular, the market, the water supply, the urban net of sewer and the installation of the first pertained Grupo Escolar in the city in the building Dr. Flamínio Lessa.

In the 20th century lands became exhausted from over farming, and coffee production declined. The fall extensive farming brought a new economic focus of industrialization and the return to commerce. Education became another focus with the installation of the Escola de Especialista de Aeronáutica (School of Specialist of Aeronautics), the campus of UNESP with the Faculdade de Engenharia (College of Engineering) of the Faculdade de tecnologia (College of Technology FATEC), and the SENAC. Tourism is also important, with the increase of popularity of Frei Galvão, the visitation of caves, and the local churches and monasteries. Inside the city itself, there are many colonial houses with the beautiful architecture of the last century. In addition to this, Agricultural tourism and Eco-Tourism are becoming popular, owing to the beauty of the wilderness and agricultural areas.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Edu Chaves Airport.

<doc id="1035036" wikidata="Q161131" url="?curid=1035036" title="Sophia Dorothea of Hanover">
<text>Sophia Dorothea of Hanover ( – 28 June 1757) was Queen in Prussia and Electress of Brandenburg during the reign of her husband, King Frederick William I, from 1713 to 1740. She was the mother of Frederick the Great (King Frederick II of Prussia).

At the time of Sophia&#x27;s birth, her father was merely the son of a German prince, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. It was not until 1701 that the Act of Settlement placed him, through his mother, in line to inherit the throne of Great Britain. Sophia was 27 years of age, and had already become the Queen in Prussia and a mother of many children by the time her father became King George I of Great Britain in 1714.

==Life==

Sophia Dorothea was born on 16 March 1687 (O.S.), in Hanover. She was the only daughter of George Louis of Hanover, later King George I of Great Britain, and his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Celle. She was detested by her elder brother, King George II of Great Britain.

After the divorce and imprisonment of her mother, she was raised in Hanover under the supervision of her paternal grandmother, Sophia of Hanover, and educated by her Huguenot teacher Madame de Sacetot.

===Marriage===

Sophia Dorothea married her cousin (her father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son), Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia, heir apparent to the Prussian throne, on 28 November 1706. They had met as children when Frederick William had spent some time in Hanover under the care of their grandmother, Sophia of Hanover, and though Sophia Dorothea disliked him, Frederick William had reportedly felt an attraction to her early on.

When a marriage was to be arranged for Frederick William, he was given two alternatives: Princess Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden or Sophia Dorothea of Hanover. The Swedish match was preferred by his father, who wished to form a matrimonial alliance with Sweden, and thus the official Albrecht Konrad Finck von Finckenstein was sent to Stockholm under the pretext of an adjustment of the disputes regarding Pomerania, but in reality to observe the princess before issuing formal negotiations: Frederick William, however, preferred Sophia Dorothea and successfully tasked Finck with making such a deterring report of Ulrika Eleonora to his father that he would encounter less opposition when he informed his father of his choice. A marriage alliance between Prussia and Hanover was regarded as a noncontroversial choice by both courts and the negotiations were swiftly conducted. In order for Sophia Dorothea to make as good an impression as possible in Berlin, her grandmother, Electress Sophia, commissioned her niece Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess of the Palatinate to procure her trousseau in Paris. Her bridal paraphernalia attracted great attention and was referred to as the greatest of any German princess yet.


The wedding by proxy took place in Hanover on 28 November 1706, and she arrived in Berlin on 27 November, where she was welcomed by her groom and his family outside of the city gates and before making her entrance into the capital. Thereafter followed a second wedding, the stately torch-dance, and six weeks of banquets and balls.

===Crown Princess in Prussia===
Sophia Dorothea was described as tall, with a beautiful slender figure, graceful and dignified with big blue eyes. Though not regarded as strictly beautiful, she was seen as quite attractive at the time of her marriage and described as charming in her manners, making a good impression in Berlin. Frederick William often called her &quot;Fiekchen&quot;.

Sophia Dorothea and Frederick William differed from each other in every aspect and the marriage suffered as a result. Sophia Dorothea was interested in art, science, literature and fashion, while Frederick William was described as an unpolished, uneducated and spartan military man with rough manners. Though he was never unfaithful to her, he was unable to win her affection. One of the most important differences between them was that Sophia Dorothea, unlike her husband, loved entertainment, something he regarded to be frivolous. Frederick William contemplated divorcing her the same year they married and, judging by her letters, accused her of not wanting to be married to him. According to Morgenstern, &quot;He had none of that astonishing complaisance by which lovers, whether husbands or friends, seek to win the favor of the beloved object. As far as can be gathered from the words he occasionally let drop, the crossing of his first love might have been the innocent cause of this; and as the object of this passion, by the directions of her mother and grandmother, treated him with harshness, where, then, could he learn to make love?&quot;

The birth of her firstborn son, Frederick Louis, in 1707 was celebrated greatly in Prussia, and Sophia Dorothea successfully asked the king to liberate the imprisoned minister Eberhard von Danckelmann. In 1708, after the death of her firstborn son, the physicians declared that Sophia Dorothea was not likely to conceive again, which prompted the remarriage of her father-in-law. However, she gave birth to several children in the following years, and finally to a son who survived in 1712.

===Queen in Prussia===
In 1713, her father-in-law Frederick I died and was succeeded by her spouse Frederick William I, making her queen in Prussia.
She lived with her husband and family in the Berlin Palace and also had to take part in the summer stays at the City Palace, Potsdam, and the frequent hunting stays in her husband&#x27;s hunting lodge in Königs Wusterhausen, but she took refuge as often as she could in the Monbijou Palace, a small pleasure palace on the banks of the Spree in Berlin, which her father-in-law gave her in 1712. Gradually she moved her court entirely there and lived there until the end of her life.

At the time of the accession, Prussia was at war with Sweden, and Sophia Dorothea accompanied Frederick William during the campaign of 1715, though she soon returned to Berlin to give birth to her daughter. During the war, the king left directions to his ministers to consult her and take no action without her approval in the case of emergency. In 1717, she hosted Peter the Great on his visit to Berlin at her own palace Monbijou, as per the king&#x27;s request, which was vandalized as a result. Sophia Dorothea&#x27;s first favorite was her maid of honor, von Wagnitz, who was dismissed after an intrigue in which Kreutz and her mother tried to make her the king&#x27;s mistress, as well as being a spy of the French ambassador Rothenburg.

Queen Sophia Dorothea was admired for her gracious manners and nicknamed &quot;Olympia&quot; for her regal bearing, but scarred by smallpox and overweight with time, she was not called a beauty. She was known as extremely haughty, proud, and ambitious, but Frederick William greatly disliked her interference in politics, as it was his belief that women should be kept only for breeding, and kept submissive as they would otherwise dominate their husbands. 
The king was known for his parsimony and dislike of idleness to such a degree that he would beat people in the street as well as in the palace if he viewed them as lazy. The queen complained about the &quot;horrible avarice&quot; he pressed upon the household and as a result, according to Pollnitz, the queen&#x27;s table was often so sparingly supplied that he had often given her money so that she could be able to have an omelette for supper.

Frederick William viewed her interests in theater, dancing, jewelry and music as frivolous and resented any sign of her living a life independently from his authority: he particularly disliked her interest in gambling, and it is reported that she and her partners would have coffee beans ready on the table during gambling, so that if the king appeared, they could pretend to be playing with them rather than money. On one occasion, the queen took the opportunity of the king being ill to host a ball at Monbijou with dancing and music, and where she herself gambled while wearing her diamond set. When the king suddenly arrived, the dancing and music stopped immediately, and the queen unclasped her jewels and hid them in her pocket. 
His manner toward her was described as rough and so noted that when he displayed the opposite, it was seen as a surprise. Upon the death of her mother in 1726, Sophia Dorothea inherited a sum of three million, whereupon it attracted attention that Frederick William suddenly treated her very well: the Imperial ambassador reported that this was merely because he wanted her money, and when she never received it (as her brother refused to release the sum), Frederick William resumed his usual manner toward her.
For her part, Sophia Dorothea did not have a high opinion of the king&#x27;s military interest or skill, and at one occasion, when he spoke disparagingly of the English commanders retorted: &quot;No doubt they must wish to give you the command of their army.&quot;

Upon the illness of the king in Brandenburg during the campaign of 1719, he sent for Sophia Dorothea and entrusted her with his will, cautioning secrecy. Within the document, she was named regent during the minority of their son, with Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and King George I of Great Britain as guardians to the crown prince. The king&#x27;s favorites, military general Friedrich von Grumbkow and Leopold I of Anhalt-Dessau, offered the queen&#x27;s favorite Madame de Blaspiel a bribe if she procured information for them and influenced the queen in their favor; she in turn informed the queen, who informed the king, who summoned von Grumbkow and the prince and told them to return to Berlin. They then tasked Madame de Blaspiel&#x27;s lover, Count de Manteufel, the Saxon ambassador, to acquire the document or at least find out its meaning: the queen did give de Blaspiel the document, and its contents were revealed to Grumbkow and Anhalt. Grumbkow and Anhalt, now wishing to lessen the queen&#x27;s influence after learning of the will appointing her regent, unsuccessfully tried to accuse her before the king of having borrowed money and pawning a pair of earrings given to her by the king to pay her gambling debts. The queen countered by accusing Grumbkow of plotting against her. 

Concurrently, the Clement Affair took place, in which the alleged Hungarian nobleman Clement gained access to the king by use of false letters and convinced him that the courts of Vienna and Dresden were orchestrating a plot to depose him in favor of the crown prince who, under the guardianship of the emperor, the queen, Grumbkow, and Arnhalt, was to then be raised a Catholic. All were accused of having been implicated in the plot before Clement was exposed as a con artist and summarily executed; another implicated was M. de Troschke, a gentleman of the chamber in service to the king, in whose possession was found a letter from Madame de Blaspiel expressing anger at the king&#x27;s imprisonment of a suspected accomplice, Monsieur de Kamecke. Grumbkow, suspecting the queen&#x27;s favorite to have exposed his plot against the queen, delivered the letter to the king, who had de Blaspiel arrested, imprisoned for a year at Spandau, and then banished. Her arrest forced the queen to remove the will of 1719 from the possession of Blaspiel before it was discovered there, to which end her chaplain procured it from the officer commissioned to seal up de Blaspiel&#x27;s room. After this the queen replaced her as confidant with her daughter, Princess Wilhelmine.

Sophia Dorothea had a very close relationship to her eldest son, Crown Prince Frederick, who was harshly treated by his father, who perceived him as effeminate. According to her daughter Wilhelmine, the queen widened the rift between the king and the crown prince by demonstrating that she viewed the king&#x27;s demands as unfair: 
:&quot;Whatever my father ordered my brother to do, my mother commanded him to do the very reverse.&quot; 
Frederick William accused her of having damaged his relationship with his children, and therefore banned them from seeing her without his presence. When the king banned the queen from communicating with her son, she corresponded with him through her daughter Wilhelmine. When he refused to let her see her eldest children, she invited them to her rooms in secrecy; on at least one occasion, Frederick and Wilhelmine were forced to hide in the furniture in her rooms when Frederick William came to her room unexpectedly while they were there. At the same time, the queen&#x27;s favorite, Madame de Ramen, acted as a spy for the king, causing their relationship to deteriorate sharply. Her children were terrorized and frequently beaten by Frederick William, who may have suffered from porphyria. During the latter years of the king&#x27;s life, he was often seized by fits of violence during which he hit people with his cane and threw things at his children. This was a difficult situation for his family, as he often forced them to attend him, refusing to let them leave from 9 AM until bedtime.

====Anglo-Prussian marriage alliance====

Sophia Dorothea held a longtime ambition to arrange a double marriage of her eldest son, Crown Prince Frederick, to Princess Amelia of Great Britain, and her eldest daughter Wilhelmine to Frederick, future Prince of Wales. This was a project that had first been raised during the children&#x27;s infancy and would result in a strong alliance between Prussia and Great Britain. Her plan was opposed by the king&#x27;s favorites Grumbkow and Anhalt, who wished to arrange a marriage between Wilhelmine and Anhalt&#x27;s nephew, Frederick William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt (the king&#x27;s first cousin). He was next in line to inherit the throne after the crown prince, whose health was delicate. If he succeeded, Anhalt and Grumbkow hoped to come into a position of power.

In 1723, the queen convinced the king to give his consent to the Prussian-British marriage alliance. In October of that year, they hosted a visit by George I in Berlin, who inspected Wilhelmine and agreed to the double marriage alliance if it was approved by Parliament. One day, Frederick William went to visit George I in Goehr. Sophia Dorothea did not accompany him, because she gave birth unexpectedly just before they were to leave. Sophia had been unaware of her pregnancy, leading to a rumor that she had tried to hide it. This caused Frederick William to suspect her of adultery. Upon his return, he had to be prevented from beating her by her chief lady-in-waiting, Sophie von Kameke, who held his arm and told him &quot;if he had only come there to kill his wife, he had better have kept away.&quot; The king questioned the physician Stahl, his regimental surgeon Holzendorf, and von Kameke about the queen&#x27;s suspected adultery, upon which von Kameke told him that &quot;if he were not her king she would strangle him on the spot&quot; for his accusation, which resulted in him making an apology to the queen and dismissing the affair. 

George I promised that the double marriage alliance would be formally agreed upon in connection with the Treaty of Hanover (1725). Sophia Dorothea accompanied Frederick William to meet George in Hanover to discuss the matter, and was left there to handle the negotiations when he returned to Berlin. However, she failed to accomplish anything, as the matter was avoided by both George I and his ministers. When she returned to Berlin, Frederick William was so discontent with her failure that he had the passage between their apartments walled up (it remained so for six weeks). Frederick, Prince of Wales, sent his agent Lamotte to ask whether she would permit a secret visit by him to see his intended bride, Wilhelmine. The queen agreed, but made the mistake of saying so to the British ambassador Dubourguai, which obliged him to inform George I. George recalled Frederick to England, and had Lamotte arrested and imprisoned. All this damaged the queen and the prospect of the marriage alliance in the eyes of the king, causing a great row between them.

From 1726 until 1735, Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff was the Austrian ambassador in Berlin and the king&#x27;s favorite. He came to be the main opponent of the queen, due to his opposition to the British-Prussian marriage alliance. The animosity between the queen and Seckendorff was well known and commented on by the king: 
:&quot;My wife and the whole world are against him; the Prince of Anhalt and my Fritz hate him like the pest, but he is a brave fellow, and loves me.&quot;

In 1729, negotiations for the British marriage alliance were disrupted by the activities of Frederick William&#x27;s army recruiters. Frederick William wanted tall soldiers for his army; his agents went all over Germany paying or even kidnapping such men. They snatched men from Hanover, whose ruler was also the king of Great Britain. This caused diplomatic incidents, and Frederick William stopped all negotiations. But the queen renewed them. When Grumbkow revealed her independent negotiations to the king, the king stated that he would marry Wilhelmine to either a prince of Schwedt or Weissenfels, and that Sophia could consent or be imprisoned for life.

She was advised by Borck to suggest Prince Frederick of Bayreuth as an alternative, which she did. Then she wrote to the queen of Great Britain, claiming illness. The reply was unsatisfactory, and the king learned of her pretense. Frederick William beat Wilhelmine in Sophia&#x27;s presence, and Sophia agreed to drop the British marriage, provided that Wilhelmine was married to Frederick of Bayreuth, not the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. She fell genuinely ill shortly afterward, and successfully asked him to reconcile with their eldest son and daughter, and afterwards beat them only in private. 

Matters changed when the British ambassador Hotham arrived and officially suggested marriage between Wilhelmine and the Prince of Wales, providing the king agreed to marriage between Crown Prince Frederick and Princess Amelia of Great Britain, and the dismissal of his favorite, the anti-British Grumbkow, whom they accused of treason against him. The king agreed to the terms, if proof of Grumbkow&#x27;s guilt was shown, and if his son was appointed governor of Hanover. Grumbkow allied with Seckendorff to prevent the marriage alliance and thus his own fall, while the latter informed the king that the British suggestion was a result of the queen&#x27;s intrigues to depose him in favor of his son and make Prussia a &quot;de facto&quot; British province through &quot;the vain and haughty English daughter-in-law&quot;, whose extravagance would ruin the state. When ambassador Hotham returned with the proof of Grumbkow&#x27;s guilt, the king reportedly flew into a rage and beat the ambassador. The queen had the crown prince write to Hotham and unsuccessfully ask him to reconcile with the king; before departing Prussia, however, he left the evidence against Grumbkow with the queen.

====Escape attempt of the Crown Prince====

Sophia Dorothea spent many days talking to her eldest son in the library, and was informed of his plans to escape from his father&#x27;s custody. In August 1730, during a tour he made with his father through the provinces, Frederick tried to escape from Prussia, and was brought back a prisoner. The king informed the queen of the event through Sophie von Kamecke before their arrival. There were compromising letters by the queen and Princess Wilhelmine in Frederick&#x27;s portefeuille, which was forwarded to them by a friend after the arrest of Frederick&#x27;s accomplice Hans Hermann von Katte. They burned the letters and replaced them with fabricated and uncompromising ones. However, &quot;as there were near fifteen hundred of the originals, although we worked very hard, not more than six hundred or seven hundred could be completed in the time&quot;. The portefeuille was also filled with ornamental articles. When the portefeuille was later opened, Frederick did not recognize its content. Grumbkow immediately suspected what had transpired and stated: &quot;These cursed women have outwitted us!&quot;


When the king returned, he told the queen that her son was dead. She replied: &quot;What! Have you murdered your son?&quot; When given the reply: &quot;He was not my son, he was only a miserable deserter,&quot; she became hysterical and screamed repeatedly: &quot;Mon Dieu, mon fils! mon Dieu, mon fils!&quot; The king then started to beat Wilhelmine and would possibly have killed her. Her siblings and ladies-in-waiting intervened. Frederick&#x27;s accomplice Katte arrived as a prisoner, so the king beat him instead. When Frederick was imprisoned at the fortress in Küstrin, Grumbkow acted as mediator between Frederick and his parents, managing to reconcile them.

The imprisonment was followed by continuous conflict between the king and the queen about the marriage of Princess Wilhelmine. While the king pressed for a marriage to the Margrave of Schwedt or the Prince of Weissenfels, the queen exchanged secret messages with her daughter and urged her not to accept any other groom than the Prince of Wales. This conflict caused the king to threaten to beat the queen and have Mademoiselle Sonsfeld publicly whipped. Finally, Wilhelmine was formally offered the choice between the Margrave of Schwedt, the Duke of Weissenfels, or the Prince of Bayreuth. She chose to marry the latter (as she had not seen him but had seen and disliked the other two), on condition that her father free her brother. Her decision was made against the will of her mother, who threatened to disown her for what she considered to be her daughter&#x27;s lack of courage, and ordered her not to speak to her future groom when he arrived. The king was furious at the cold demeanor of the queen during the following visit of the Prince of Bayreuth.

After the betrothal of Wilhelmine and the Prince of Bayreuth, a message arrived in which George II consented to Wilhelmine marrying the Prince of Wales without her brother marrying his daughter Amelia. This message convinced the queen that a Prussian-British marriage alliance was possible. She therefore made a point of harassing the Prince of Bayreuth to stop the wedding. On the day of the wedding (20 November 1731), Sophia Dorothea tried to delay the ceremony by disarranging her daughter&#x27;s hair every time it had been dressed, saying she was not satisfied with the effect, in the hope that a British courier might arrive in time to stop the ceremony.

When Frederick was liberated after his sister&#x27;s wedding, Sophia Dorothea resumed negotiations with Great Britain to marry him to Princess Amelia, and her next daughter, Philippine Charlotte, to the Prince of Wales, which would complete her life project of a Prussian-British marriage alliance. These plans was crushed in 1733, when Frederick William instead announced a marriage alliance with Brunswick by marrying Frederick to Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern and Philippine Charlotte to Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

But Sophia continued to pursue a Prussian-British marriage alliance, accomplishing a &quot;reconciliation between the houses of England and Prussia negotiated by the Queen&quot;, this time by the marriage of the Prince of Wales to her third daughter Louisa Ulrika: 
:&quot;La Herwein has conveyed the portrait of Ulrica to the Prince of Wales, and entertained Olympia (the Queen) with false hopes.&quot;

This was crushed upon the marriage of the Prince of Wales in 1736 to Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Louisa Ulrika went on to become the Queen of Sweden.

Sophia Dorothea favored the French side in the War of the Polish Succession of 1733–36, and disliked the king&#x27;s participation in the war on the Austrian side. She openly declared her view when the king swore loyalty to Austria: &quot;I shall live to make you, who are so incredulous, believe, and prove to you how you are deceived.&quot;

During the last years of the king&#x27;s life, he was afflicted with fits of illness which often forced him to use a wheelchair, and Sophia Dorothea was ordered to attend to him continuously. She seldom left his room for months before his death, save to follow him in his wheelchair; she bore with his impatience, soothed his suffering, and hers was the hand which, to the last, best smoothed the pillow, and administered the potion.

In the beginning of November 1739, the king was attacked by his last illness. The queen sent for the crown prince on the night of the 26 May 1740, in consequence of a change which had taken place in the king. However, when Frederick arrived from Rheinsberg, whence he had travelled with all speed, he was astonished to find the king in his chair, in the garden; it was, however, but a momentary rally. He had a long final conversation with the Prince Royal, and took a solemn and tender leave of the queen, his sons and daughters, and other relatives.

On the day of his death, Frederick William ordered himself to be taken to the queen&#x27;s apartment and told her: &quot;Rise, I have but a few hours to live, and I would at least have the satisfaction of dying in your arms.&quot;

However, the queen was led out of the room as Frederick William breathed his last in the arms of his son and successor.

===Queen Dowager===
On 31 May 1740, Frederick William died and was succeeded by her son, Frederick II (the Great).

The loss of a husband, who, despite his frequent harsh treatment, had been sincerely attached to her, and who was endeared by the habitual intercourse of many years, deeply affected Sophia Dorothea. When the Marchioness of Bayreuth revisited Berlin, she found her mother clad in deep mourning, and with an air of profound dejection impressed upon her features.

Sophia Dorothea had a very good relationship with her son, the new king. When she addressed him as &quot;Your Majesty&quot; after the funeral of his father, he interrupted her and told her: &quot;Always call me your son, that title is dearer to me than the royal dignity.&quot; Frederick was known for his devotion to her, expressed his gratitude for her having raised him and never blamed her for his traumatic childhood, which he instead blamed on his father, and never allowed anyone to criticize her.

Sophia Dorothea lost no importance as a queen dowager: wary of the great respect the king afforded his mother and his neglect of his wife, the foreign envoys and other supplicants considered attending the audience chamber and receptions as of the queen dowager as even more important than that of the queen. Until her death, he honored her as the first lady of his court and placed her before that of his wife, the queen. It was to his mother&#x27;s chamber the king paid the first visit on his return from campaigns, summoning the queen to meet him there; he regularly invited his mother to his personal residence at Potsdam, where his wife was never invited, and while he seldom visited his wife, he regularly attended his mother at Monbijou, where he took off his hat and remained standing until she gave him permission to sit. Sophia Dorothea presided at the wedding of her son Prince William in 1742, and her daughter Louisa Ulrika in 1744.

The relationship between Sophia Dorothea and her daughter-in-law queen Elisabeth Christine was not good during the first years of her son&#x27;s reign, as she resented her daughter-in-law&#x27;s precedence in rank, though her son assured it to be merely formal, but their relationship improved during the last years of her life. Sophia Dorothea saw her son for the last time after his first campaign in January 1757 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. At that point she was well, but soon after his departure, her health rapidly declined, and she died on 28 June 1757.

<doc id="1035039" wikidata="Q1529876" url="?curid=1035039" title="Smooth number">
<text>In number theory, an n&quot;-smooth(or n&quot;-friable) number is an integer whose prime factors are all less than or equal to &quot;n&quot;. For example, a 7-smooth number is a number in which every prime factor is at most 7. Therefore, 49 = 72 and 15750 = 2 × 32 × 53 × 7 are both 7-smooth, while 11 and 702 = 2 × 33 × 13 are not 7-smooth. The term seems to have been coined by Leonard Adleman. Smooth numbers are especially important in cryptography, which relies on factorization of integers. 2-smooth numbers are simply the powers of 2, while 5-smooth numbers are also known as regular numbers.

==Definition==
A positive integer is called B-smooth if none of its prime factors are greater than B. For example, 1,620 has prime factorization 22 × 34 × 5; therefore 1,620 is 5-smooth because none of its prime factors are greater than 5. This definition includes numbers that lack some of the smaller prime factors; for example, both 10 and 12 are 5-smooth, even though they miss out the prime factors 3 and 5, respectively. All 5-smooth numbers are of the form 2&quot;a&quot; × 3&quot;b&quot; × 5&quot;c&quot;, where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are non-negative integers.

The 3-smooth numbers have also been called &quot;harmonic numbers&quot;, although that name has other more widely used meanings.
5-smooth numbers are also called regular numbers or Hamming numbers; 7-smooth numbers are also called humble numbers, and sometimes called &quot;highly composite&quot;, although this conflicts with another meaning of highly composite numbers.

Here, note that B itself is not required to appear among the factors of a B-smooth number. If the largest prime factor of a number is p then the number is B-smooth for any B ≥ p. In many scenarios B is prime, but composite numbers are permitted as well. A number is B-smooth if and only if it is p-smooth, where p is the largest prime less than or equal to B.

An important practical application of smooth numbers is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms (such as the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm), which operates by recursively breaking down a problem of a given size &quot;n&quot; into problems the size of its factors. By using &quot;B&quot;-smooth numbers, one ensures that the base cases of this recursion are small primes, for which efficient algorithms exist. (Large prime sizes require less-efficient algorithms such as Bluestein&#x27;s FFT algorithm.)

5-smooth or regular numbers play a special role in Babylonian mathematics. They are also important in music theory (see Limit (music)), and the problem of generating these numbers efficiently has been used as a test problem for functional programming.

Smooth numbers have a number of applications to cryptography. While most applications center around cryptanalysis (e.g. the fastest known integer factorization algorithms, for example: the general number field sieve), the VSH hash function is another example of a constructive use of smoothness to obtain a provably secure design.

==Distribution==

Let formula_1 denote the number of &quot;y&quot;-smooth integers less than or equal to &quot;x&quot; (the de Bruijn function).

If the smoothness bound &quot;B&quot; is fixed and small, there is a good estimate for formula_2:

:formula_3
where formula_4 denotes the number of primes less than or equal to formula_5.

Otherwise, define the parameter &quot;u&quot; as &quot;u&quot; = log &quot;x&quot; / log &quot;y&quot;: that is, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;&quot;u&quot;. Then,

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the Dickman function.

For any &quot;k&quot;, almost all natural numbers will not be &quot;k&quot;-smooth.

If formula_8 where formula_9 is formula_5-smooth and formula_11 is not (or is equal to 1), then formula_9 is called the formula_5-smooth part of formula_14. The relative size of the formula_15-smooth part of a random integer less than or equal to formula_16 is known to decay much more slowly than formula_7.

==Powersmooth numbers==
Further, &quot;m&quot; is called &quot;n&quot;-powersmooth (or &quot;n&quot;-ultrafriable) if all prime &quot;powers&quot; formula_18 dividing &quot;m&quot; satisfy:

:formula_19

For example, 720 (24 × 32 × 51) is 5-smooth but not 5-powersmooth (because there are several prime powers greater than 5, &quot;e.g.&quot; formula_20 and formula_21). It is 16-powersmooth since its greatest prime factor power is 24 = 16. The number is also 17-powersmooth, 18-powersmooth, etc.

Unlike &quot;n&quot;-smooth numbers, for any positive integer &quot;n&quot; there are only finitely many &quot;n&quot;-powersmooth numbers, in fact, the &quot;n&quot;-powersmooth numbers are exactly the positive divisors of “the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, …, &quot;n&quot;” , e.g. the 9-powersmooth numbers (also the 10-powersmooth numbers) are exactly the positive divisors of 2520.

&quot;n&quot;-smooth and &quot;n&quot;-powersmooth numbers have applications in number theory, such as in Pollard&#x27;s &quot;p&quot; − 1 algorithm and ECM. Such applications are often said to work with &quot;smooth numbers,&quot; with no &quot;n&quot; specified; this means the numbers involved must be &quot;n&quot;-powersmooth, for some unspecified small number &quot;n. A&quot;s &quot;n&quot; increases, the performance of the algorithm or method in question degrades rapidly. For example, the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm for computing discrete logarithms has a running time of O(&quot;n&quot;1/2)—for groups of &quot;n&quot;-smooth order.

==Smooth over a set &quot;A&quot;==
Moreover, &quot;m&quot; is said to be smooth over a set &quot;A&quot; if there exists a factorization of &quot;m&quot; where the factors are powers of elements in &quot;A&quot;. For example, since 12 = 4 × 3, 12 is smooth over the sets &quot;A&quot;1 = {4, 3}, &quot;A&quot;2 = {2, 3}, and formula_22, however it would not be smooth over the set &quot;A&quot;3 = {3, 5}, as 12 contains the factor 4 = 22, and neither 4 nor 2 are in &quot;A&quot;3.

Note the set &quot;A&quot; does not have to be a set of prime factors, but it is typically a proper subset of the primes as seen in the factor base of Dixon&#x27;s factorization method and the quadratic sieve. Likewise, it is what the general number field sieve uses to build its notion of smoothness, under the homomorphism formula_23.

<doc id="1035054" wikidata="Q3798188" url="?curid=1035054" title="Gunning fog index">
<text>In linguistics, the Gunning fog index is a readability test for English writing. The index estimates the years of formal education a person needs to understand the text on the first reading. For instance, a fog index of 12 requires the reading level of a United States high school senior (around 18 years old). The test was developed in 1952 by Robert Gunning, an American businessman who had been involved in newspaper and textbook publishing.

The fog index is commonly used to confirm that text can be read easily by the intended audience. Texts for a wide audience generally need a fog index less than 12. Texts requiring near-universal understanding generally need an index less than 8.

== Calculation ==
The Gunning fog index is calculated with the following algorithm:
# Select a passage (such as one or more full paragraphs) of around 100 words. Do not omit any sentences;
# Determine the average sentence length. (Divide the number of words by the number of sentences.);
# Count the &quot;complex&quot; words consisting of three or more syllables. Do not include proper nouns, familiar jargon, or compound words. Do not include common suffixes (such as -es, -ed, or -ing) as a syllable;
# Add the average sentence length and the percentage of complex words; and
# Multiply the result by 0.4.
The complete formula is:
:formula_1

==Limitations==
A high fog index is a good measure of hard-to-read text, but it has its limits. Not all complex words are difficult to understand. For example, &quot;interesting&quot; is not generally thought to be a difficult word, although it has three syllables (excluding the common -ing suffix). On the other hand, short words can still be difficult if they are not often used. The frequency of word usage also affects the readability of a text. Additionally, the fog index is primarily applicable to English and may not accurately reflect readability in other languages.

Until the 1980s, the fog index was calculated differently. The original formula counted each clause as a sentence. Because the index was meant to measure clarity of expression within sentences, it assumed people saw each clause as a complete thought.

In the 1980s, the calculation method changed. From this point onward, the clause counting step was left out in counting the fog index &quot;for literature&quot;. This might have been because it had to be done manually. Judith Bogert of Pennsylvania State University defended the original algorithm in 1985. However, a review of subsequent literature generally recommends the newer method.

Nevertheless, some argue that a series of simple, short sentences does not mean that the reading is easier. For example, in Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, the fog scores using the old and revised algorithms differ greatly. A sample test using an automated Gunning Fog calculator on a random footnote from the text (#51: Dion, vol. I. lxxix. p. 1363. Herodian, l. v. p. 189.) gave an index of 19.2 using only the sentence count, and an index of 12.5 when including independent clauses. This brought down the fog index from post-graduate to high school level.

<doc id="1035055" wikidata="Q6658663" url="?curid=1035055" title="Liverpool poets">
<text>The Liverpool poets are a number of influential 1960s poets from Liverpool, England, influenced by 1950s Beat poetry. 

Their work is characterised by its directness of expression, simplicity of language, suitability for live performance and concern for contemporary subjects and references. There is often humour, but the full range of human experience and emotion is addressed.
==Poets==
The poets most commonly associated with this label are Adrian Henri, Roger McGough and Brian Patten. They were featured in a 1967 book &quot;The Liverpool Scene&quot; edited by Edward Lucie-Smith, with a blurb by Ginsberg and published by Donald Carroll.

Although he was born in Sussex, Adrian Mitchell shared many of the concerns of the Liverpool poets and is often linked with them in critical discussion.

Other related poets include the Londoner Pete Brown (who wrote lyrics for Cream), Pete Morgan and Alan Jackson (both associated with the 1960s Edinburgh poetry scene), Tom Pickard and Barry MacSweeney (both from Newcastle), Spike Hawkins, Jim Bennett, Heather Holden, Mike Evans, Pete Roche and Henry Graham.

The poets generally came from a working-class background and went to art college rather than university. There was a strong allegiance with pop music, and the values and effectiveness of that in reaching out to a wide audience informed the poetry. Readings took place in a pub or club environment.

==The Mersey Sound==

The anthology &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot; was published by Penguin in 1967, containing the poems of Adrian Henri, Roger McGough and Brian Patten, and has remained in print ever since, selling in excess of 500,000 copies. It brought the three poets to &quot;considerable acclaim and critical fame&quot;, and has been widely influential. In 2002 they were given the Freedom of the City of Liverpool.

==Bands==
===The Liverpool Scene===
The Liverpool Scene was a poetry band, which included Adrian Henri, Andy Roberts, Mike Evans, Mike Hart, Percy Jones and Brian Dodson. It grew out of the success of &quot;The Incredible New Liverpool Scene,&quot; a CBS LP featuring Henri and McGough reading their work, with accompaniment by the guitarist Roberts. Liverpool DJ John Peel, who was then working on the pirate radio station Radio London, picked up on the LP and featured it on his influential late-night Perfumed Garden show. After Radio London closed down, Peel visited Liverpool and met the band; as a consequence, they were featured in session on his BBC Top Gear and &quot;Night Ride&quot; shows, and in 1968 he produced their first LP. Four LPs were issued with Henri&#x27;s poetry heavily featured.

Despite Peel&#x27;s support the albums achieved little success, although the band did become popular on the UK university and college circuit. Their public performances included a 1969 tour when they opened for Led Zeppelin; they also toured the US but did not attract much acclaim from US critics and audiences. Henri was described in performance as &quot;bouncing thunderously and at risk to audience and fellow performers, the stage vibrating out of rhythm beneath him.&quot;

The albums were:
*&quot;The Incredible New Liverpool Scene&quot; (CBS 1967)
*&quot;Amazing Adventures of&quot; (RCA 1968)
*&quot;Bread on the Night&quot; (RCA 1969)
*&quot;St. Adrian &amp; Co., Broadway and 3rd&quot; (RCA 1970)
*&quot;Heirloon&quot; (RCA 1971)
*&quot;Recollections&quot; (Charisma 1972) 
There were at least three &quot;best of&quot; albums and a single &quot;Love Is&quot; / &quot;Woo-Woo&quot;.

===The Scaffold===

The best-known band to emerge was The Scaffold (1963–1974), which featured John Gorman, Mike McCartney (brother of Paul McCartney) and Roger McGough. Initially Adrian Henri was a member, when they were known as &quot;The Liverpool, One Fat Lady, All Electric Show&quot;. (&quot;One Fat Lady&quot; is the bingo term for 8, and they mostly lived in the Liverpool 8 district.)

In January 1968 &quot;Thank U Very Much&quot; (sung with a Liverpool accent) reached number 4 in the charts. A year later &quot;Lily the Pink&quot; reached number 1. Ringo Starr&#x27;s bass drum was used; also featured were Jack Bruce from Cream, Graham Nash from The Hollies and Reg Dwight, later renaming himself Elton John. Both hits were in the spirit of cheery and humorous drinking songs.

===Grimms===

A touring and recording ensemble, Grimms (1971–76), contained an ever-changing cast of Adrian Henri, Brian Patten, Roger McGough, John Gorman, Mike McGear (McCartney), George &quot;Zoot&quot; Money, Neil Innes, Vivian Stanshall, Michael Giles, Kate Robbins, John Megginson, Andy Roberts, David Richards, Peter &quot;Ollie&quot; Halsall, Norman Smedles, Brian Jones, Ritchie Routledge, Valerie Movie, Gerry Conway, Pete Tatters and Timmy Donald (amongst many others).

==Criticism==

===For===
S.N. Radhika Lakshmi observes &quot;the Liverpool poets&#x27; approach to poetry differs from that of other poets in that they consistently give the impression of being real people getting to grips with real and pressing situations.&quot; She continues:
:Like the French Symbolists, Baudelaire and Rimbaud, &#x27;The Liverpool poets&#x27; believe that the effect that a poem produces is more important than the poem itself; a poem should be considered as an &#x27;agent&#x27; (that conveys the poet&#x27;s message), rather than as an &#x27;object&#x27;. The poetry of &#x27;The Liverpool poets&#x27; is also characterized by the undercurrent of sarcasm, irony and pungent wit, which runs through many of their poems. They are also noted for their directness of expression, simplicity of style, and, (in the manner of Robert Frost), their deft handling of complicated ideas in uncomplicated language.

Adrian Henri was described by Lucie-Smith as &quot;the theoretician of the group&quot; and asserted the need to be in touch with contemporary life, following T. S. Eliot&#x27;s dictum &quot;to purify the dialect of the tribe&quot; and pointing out that his tribe included everyone from motor-bike specialists through consultant gynaecologists and Beatles fans to admen and peeping toms. His conclusion was:
:the whole post-Gutenberg galaxy of expanding communications &quot;can&quot; become the subject-matter of the poet, it&#x27;s just that most poets are afraid to face up to the consequences of it.&quot;

===Against===
The emergence of the Liverpool poets as pioneers of &quot;pop poetry&quot; in the UK engendered hostility from the literary establishment. Ian Hamilton said:
:A lot was going on that we were in opposition to: there was the Group; there was pop poetry; there was the Liverpool Scene. And when Lucie-Smith, arch-organiser of the Group, went off and edited a book called The Liverpool Scene, praising those people to the skies we thought: &#x27;Treasonable clerk. This is the sort of thing you&#x27;d expect from these corrupt, opportunistic, careerist-type figures.&#x27; So we went at them. As for nurturing talent, the talent that was around we... nurtured.

Al Alvarez wrote about &quot;the fashion for the diluted near-verse designed for mass readings and poetry-and-jazz concerts&quot;, linking it with pop lyrics as &quot;the logic of a traditional form at its weariest&quot;, scolding &quot;the poet resigns his responsibilities&quot; and concluding, &quot;what he offers is not poetry&quot;, a criticism remarkably similar to that made by F. Dalton in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, on 31 June 1917 about &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;: &quot;The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to &quot;poetry&quot;...&quot;.

==Legacy==
Alan Bleasdale said, &quot;The poetry of Henri, Patten and McGough has stayed with me for 35 years. The beauty is its accessibility.&quot;

Roger McGough in a 2019 interview said, &quot;I like to think that young poets on Merseyside will see me as one of their own, a poet they can get along with.&quot;

<text>The Paris Motor Show () is a biennial auto show in Paris. Held during October, it is one of the most important auto shows, often with many new production automobile and concept car debuts. The show presently takes place in Paris expo Porte de Versailles. The &quot;Mondial&quot; is scheduled by the &quot;Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d&#x27;Automobiles&quot;, which considers it a major international auto show.

In 2016, the Paris Motor Show welcomed 1,253,513 visitors, making it the most visited auto show in the world, ahead of Tokyo and Frankfurt.

The key figures of the show are: of exhibition, 8 pavilions, 260 brands from 18 countries, 65 world premieres, more than 10 000 test drives for electric and hybrid cars, more than 10 000 journalists from 103 countries. Until 1986, it was called the Salon de l&#x27;Automobile; it took the name in 1988 and &quot;Mondial Paris Motor Show&quot; in 2018.

The show was held annually until 1976; since which time, it has been held biennially.

==History==
The show was the first motor show in the world, started in 1898 by industry pioneer, Jules-Albert de Dion. After 1910, it was held at the &quot;Grand Palais&quot; in the Champs-Élysées. During the First World War motor shows were suspended, meaning that the show of October 1919 was only the 15th &quot;Salon&quot;.

There was again no Paris Motor Show in 1925, the venue having been booked instead for an Exhibition of Decorative Arts. In October 1926, the Motor Show returned, this being the 26th Paris Salon de l&#x27;Automobile. The outbreak of war again intervened in 1939 when the 33rd Salon de l&#x27;Automobile was cancelled at short notice.

Normality of a sorts returned some six years later and the 33rd &quot;Salon&quot; finally opened in October 1946. In January 1977, it was announced that no Paris Motor Show would take place that year, because of the &quot;current economic situation&quot;: at the same time the organisers confirmed that a 1978 &quot;Auto Salon&quot; for Paris was planned.

The 65th Salon de Paris duly opened on 15 October 1978 in the modern buildings of the Parc des Expositions, on the south western edge of central Paris at the Porte de Versailles, where the show had been held since 1962.

<text>Bradfield is a village and civil parish in Berkshire, England. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 2,208, which was slightly more than the 2,177 recorded at the 2011 census. Aside from farms and a smaller amount of woodland its main settlements are Bradfield Southend, its medieval-founded nucleus and the hamlet of Tutts Clump. Bradfield village is the home of the public school Bradfield College.

==Location==
Bradfield&#x27;s traditional centre is on the mid-flood plain of the River Pang centred west of Reading, where the Theale to Compton road crosses the river. Bradfield Southend is centred about a mile to the south west on the gentle escarpment between the Pang and the River Kennet. Other villages and hamlets in the parish include Tutts Clump, Clay Hill and Rotten Row. There is a complex of ponds in the vicinity of the latter containing very good examples of artesian aquifers. Best known of these is &#x27;The Blue Pool&#x27; which has delighted generations of children. In recent years, the current owners have had to deny access to the site due to fluctuating levels of pollution. Plans for better access have not yet come to fruition. To the west of Clay Hill is King&#x27;s Copse, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

==History==

In the 12th-century Abingdon Chronicle, &quot;Bradenfeld&quot; is described as forming part of Abingdon Abbey in 699. The Domesday Book refers to the area as &quot;Bradefelt&quot;. The name may derive from the Anglo-Saxon meaning &#x27;broad piece of open land&#x27;.

In the mid 18th century, the village was the site of two watermills, one fewer than had been recorded in the Doomsday Book 700 years prior.

In 1835, the Bradfield Poor Law Union was formed, and a workhouse, designed by Sampson Kempthorne, was built to accommodate 250 people. The small church of St Simon and St Jude was also built on the site. Between 1948 and 1991 the site was known as &quot;Wayland Hospital&quot;, a residential home for people with learning difficulties. Housing was built on the site at the end of the 20th century.

===St Andrew&#x27;s Church===
A church in Bradfield is first referenced in the charter of Dudley Priory in the early 12th century.

The advowson belonged to the Lord of Bradfield Manor. It passed to Thomas Stevens in 1842, who funded the restoration and rebuilding of the Church of England parish church of St Andrew by George Gilbert Scott in 1847. The 16th-century tower and 14th-century north nave predate the Victorian restoration. The church is a Grade II* listed building. Stevens went on to found Bradfield College.

In 1982, Catherine Middleton, the future Princess of Wales, was christened at St Andrew&#x27;s Church.

The last service was held in the church in 2014, and it was bought from the Diocese of Oxford by Bradfield College in 2019.

===War memorial===

Bradfield&#x27;s war memorial is the last work of George Blackall Simonds, which commemorates the deaths of members of the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers in the First World War, including his son.

<doc id="1035076" wikidata="Q184409" url="?curid=1035076" title="Guarulhos">
<text>Guarulhos () is a Brazilian municipality. It is the second most populous city in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, the 13th most populous city in Brazil, and is also the most populous city in the country that is not a state capital. In the last few years it has outgrown Campinas. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. Its population is 1,291,771 with an area of 318.68 km2.

==Overview==
The name comes from the Tupi language, and means &quot;Eaters&quot;, &quot;big-bellied people&quot;; a reference to the original indigenous inhabitants of the area.

It ranks eighth by GDP among Brazilian cities; second in São Paulo state. (source:IBGE, Brazil&#x27;s national institute of statistics. GDP by cities report, published in 2005 with data from 2002). It is the tenth largest suburb in the world. The per capita income for the municipality is R$12,793. São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport (GRU), one of the main Brazilian airports, is located there. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Guarulhos.

The municipality contains part of the Cantareira State Park, created in 1962, which protects a large part of the metropolitan São Paulo water supply.
It also contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraíba do Sul river.

==History==
Guarulhos was founded on December 8, 1560, by the Jesuit priest Manuel de Paiva and entitled Nossa Senhora da Conceição. Its origin is linked to five other small villages that were in charge of defending the boundaries of São Paulo de Piratininga Village against the Tamoios, a tribe of Indigenous people that lived in that region.

In the sixteenth century, Guarulhos was a strategic location: it bordered the future São Paulo&#x27;s Capital and was surrounded by the Tietê (south), and Cabuçu de Cima (west) rivers. On that same period, was established, for similar purposes, São Miguel Village, called nowadays São Miguel Paulista District in São Paulo.

In 1880, Guarulhos emancipated from São Paulo and was named Nossa Senhora da Conceição dos Guarulhos. Its current name, Guarulhos, was adopted later, after the enactment of the law #1.021, on November 6, 1906.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the city was remarked by the settlement of a railroad and the power electricity system (Light &amp; Power C.O.), by numerous requests for the implantation of a telephone system, industrial building permits, by commercial activities, and public transportation.

During the 1930s, the city witnessed the actions of the Federal Intervention and the Constitutional Movement (Reflections of the Revolution that marked the end of the &quot;Old Republic&quot; during the 1930s in Brazil).

In 1940 the Monteiro Lobato Municipal Library was founded, in 1941, the first Health Center of the city, and ten years after that, the Holy House of Mercy of Guarulhos was established. On that decade arrive in the municipality Industries from different sectors: electricity; metallurgy; plastics; food; rubber; footwear; vehicles; clocks, and leather.

In 1945 the São Paulo&#x27;s Air Force Base (BASP) was transferred from Campo de Marte, a small airport in São Paulo, to the Cumbica neighborhood in Guarulhos.

In 1958 the Rotary Club established a branch in the city.

The Municipal Conservatory of Guarulhos was founded in 1961.

In 1963 the Commercial &amp; Industrial Association of Guarulhos was founded, nowadays, the institution is called Commerce &amp; Business Association of Guarulhos (Associação Comercial e Empresarial de Guarulhos – ACE).

With the big boom of the Industrial sector, a large number of manpower was drawn. This new population settled in an urban area on a continuous process of land occupation. At this rate the population grew from 35,000 in 1950 to 101,000 in 1960, from 237,000 in 1970 to 532,726 in 1980. Most of these citizens devoted themselves to Industrial activities in Guarulhos (that hosts around 2,000 establishments), and São Paulo.

In 1985 the Cumbica Airport was opened. Today it is called &quot;International Airport of São Paulo–Guarulhos Governor André Franco Montoro&quot; (Aeroporto Internacional de São Paulo–Guarulhos Governador André Franco Montoro), the second-biggest airport in Latin America.

Between 2000 and 2006, its population grew three times as much as São Paulo State. According to IBGE, Guarulhos is the second most populous city in the State after São Paulo&#x27;s capital. Most of its population is economically active and evenly distributed in terms of gender.

<text>Bradfield College is a coeducational public school (independent boarding and day school) for pupils aged 13–18, in the village of Bradfield, in Berkshire, in the United Kingdom. It is noted for its open-air Greek theatre and its triennial Greek play.

The school is a member of the Rugby Group, which also includes Rugby, Harrow, Shrewsbury, Wellington College and Charterhouse.

The college was founded in 1850 by Thomas Stevens, Rector and Lord of the Manor of Bradfield. It has around 490 male and 320 female pupils.

==Overview==
According to the &quot;Good Schools Guide&quot;, &quot;Thoroughly unpretentious yet with lots to boast about, Bradfield is a heavenly place to learn and to grow. Very difficult to imagine who would not thrive here. There&#x27;s something for everyone and lots for all.&quot;

The school, which admits pupils between the ages of 13 and 18, has been fully co-educational since September 2005. All first year pupils (Fourth Formers) enter a first year boarding house (Faulkner&#x27;s) and then, from the second year (known as the Shell), they move to their main boarding houses for the remaining four years.

The school motto is the Latin rendering of Psalm 119:12 &quot;Benedictus es, O Domine. Doce me Statuta Tua&quot;, which means &quot;You are blessed, Lord. Teach me your Laws&quot;.

==History==
Bradfield College was founded in 1850 by Thomas Stevens. Stevens had inherited the manor of Bradfield from his father in 1842, having been in his family for four generations. As a tribute to his father, he set about restoring St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Bradfield and commissioned Sir Gilbert Scott (one of whose architect sons, John Oldrid Scott, was later to marry Thomas Stevens&#x27;s eldest daughter, Mary Anne) to effect the restoration. It was decided that the majority of the church, except the tower, should be demolished and rebuilt in a style influenced by that of gothic architecture. After the completion of the church in 1848, Stevens saw it fit to arrange a choir. While the whole village were able to sing, they were not felt to be of a high enough standard. It was proposed that a college be established at Bradfield, to be called St Andrew&#x27;s College. The college was to be for the education of a limited number of boys between the ages of 8 and 12, all to be from modest backgrounds. Their education was to be based upon &#x27;true Church principles&#x27;, with focus to be paid on reading, writing, mathematics, and music, and later on, classics and history.

The first headmaster to be appointed was F. B. Guy in 1852. The headmaster was to be under control of the college warden, who would be responsible for the principal governance of the college. Soon after the formal establishment of the college, all references to &#x27;true Church principles&#x27; were dropped, with the focus now being on providing an education like that of other British Public Schools.

By 1880 there were eight masters and 75 boys (far fewer than the founder&#x27;s aim of 300); creditors were petitioning for the school&#x27;s bankruptcy given debts of £160,000; by 1900 there were 292 students, making the school more financially viable.

==The Greek play==
Bradfield is renowned for its Greek plays and outdoor Greek theatre. The first Greek play, &quot;Alcestis&quot;, was performed in the original language in 1881. The play was put on by Headmaster, Herbert Branston Gray to save the school from bankruptcy and was inspired by the performance of &quot;Agamemnon&quot; at Balliol College, Oxford in 1880, directed by F. R. Benson, who stage-managed the Bradfield performance and took the role of Apollo.

The theatre was based on that at Epidaurus and built in a disused chalk pit. It opened in 1890 with a performance of &quot;Antigone&quot;.

The theatre was closed in 2009 due to its poor state of repair, especially the temple building. Following a £1.3 million appeal, the theatre was restored and reopened with a performance of &quot;Antigone&quot; on 20 June 2014. The college decided not to rebuild the Victorian temple at the rear of the performing area because such &quot;temples&quot; are not true to the design of ancient Greek theatres.

The Greek play is normally performed on a three-year rota. The students who act in them receive no formal training in speaking Ancient Greek, and have only nine months to learn the lines and direction, while keeping up with their studies. The 2023 &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; was the first hybrid production; the choral elements were performed in Ancient Greek, alongside scenes in Modern English.

=== Current Headmaster ===
Dr Christopher Stevens succeeded Simon Henderson as Headmaster in September 2015. Stevens was educated at Tonbridge School and then read Modern and Medieval Languages at Cambridge University, from where he received his MA. He began his teaching career as a college lecturer while researching for a DPhil in Italian literature at Oxford University. He then established a school in France for Ashdown House, the boarding prep school in Sussex. He joined Uppingham School in 1997 where he was master-in-charge of cricket and a housemaster for nine years. In 2011 he moved to Marlborough College, and was Second Master until his appointment at Bradfield. In October 2024, Stevens announced that he would resign as headmaster in 2025, remaining in the position for the remainder of the academic year.

=== Incoming Headmaster ===
In December 2024, after a selection process, the Warden of the college announced that Jeremy Quartermain would succeed Stevens as Headmaster at the beginning of the 2025/26 academic year. Quartermain is currently headmaster of Rossall School, previously holding positions at Brentwood and Gresham&#x27;s.

==Other information==
In September 2010 the Blackburn Science Centre was opened. The building includes green elements such as a bio-mass boiler, green roof and solar panels.

Since September 2012 Bradfield has offered the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) alongside the traditional A Level pathway.

In Summer 2023 Bradfield received an outstanding inspection report from the Independent Schools Inspectorate.

The oldest building is college gateway, which incorporates part of a barn of 1382. The wrought iron was made by the village blacksmith.

In 2019 the last service was held at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, with the college subsequently purchasing the building from the Diocese of Oxford, before then being deconsecrated. The Church is the location where the Duchess of Cornwall was baptised. The college has now completed converting it into a secondary library and working space as part of an £8m project. Construction commenced in April 2022, with the building being opened in September 2024 by Louis de Bernières.

Each August, the college serves as the &#x27;base camp&#x27; for the Bradfield Ringing Course, which aims to improve the standard of change-ringing in the United Kingdom.

===Southern Railway Schools Class===
The 24th steam locomotive (Engine 923) in the Southern Railway&#x27;s class V was originally named &#x27;Uppingham&#x27;, but after objections from Uppingham School the name was changed to &#x27;Bradfield&#x27;. This class was known as the Schools Class because all 40 of the locomotives were named after English public schools. &#x27;Uppingham&#x27; was built in December 1933 and had its name changed to &#x27;Bradfield&#x27; on 14 August 1934.

==Houses==
Bradfield has 12 boarding houses in total. All first years pupils (Fourth Formers) enter a first year boarding house (Faulkner&#x27;s) and then, from the second year (known as the Shell), they move to their main boarding houses for the remaining four years.

<text>Adrian Henri (10 April 1932 – 20 December 2000) was a British poet and painter best remembered as the founder of poetry-rock group the Liverpool Scene and as one of three poets in the best-selling anthology &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot;, along with Brian Patten and Roger McGough. The trio of Liverpool poets came to prominence in that city&#x27;s Merseybeat &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of the 1960s and 1970s. He was described by Edward Lucie-Smith in &quot;British Poetry since 1945&quot; as the &quot;theoretician&quot; of the three. His characterisation of popular culture in verse helped to widen the audience for poetry among 1960s British youth. He was influenced by the French Symbolist school of poetry and surrealist art.

==Life and career==

Adrian Henri&#x27;s grandfather was a seaman from Mauritius who settled in Birkenhead, Cheshire, where Henri was born. In 1938, at the age of six, he moved to Rhyl. He studied art at King&#x27;s College (now Newcastle University) and for a short time taught art at Preston Catholic College before going on to lecture in art at both Manchester and Liverpool Colleges of Art. He was closely associated with other artists of the area and the era including the Pop artist Neville Weston and the conceptual artist Keith Arnatt. In 1972 he won second prize for his painting &quot;Meat Painting II – In Memoriam Rene Magritte&quot; in the John Moores competition. He was president of the Merseyside Arts Association and Liverpool Academy of the Arts in the 1970s and was an honorary professor of the city&#x27;s John Moores University. 

Henri had a 10-year relationship with Carol Ann Duffy, who later became Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. The pair met when she was 16, him 39 at the time, and lived together until 1982. Henri married once, to Joyce; the couple later separated. He had no children. For the last 15 years of his life his partner was Catherine Marcangeli. His career spanned everything from artist and poet to teacher, rock-and-roll performer, playwright and librettist. He could name among his friends John Lennon, George Melly, Allen Ginsberg, Willy Russell, John Willett and Paul McCartney. Unlike McGough and Patten, Henri turned his back on the trendier London scene, and chose to remain in Liverpool, saying there was nowhere he loved better.

His numerous publications include &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot; (Penguin, 1967), with McGough and Patten, a best-selling poetry anthology that brought all three of them to wider attention, &quot;Collected Poems, 1967–85&quot; (Allison &amp; Busby, 1986), &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (Jonathan Cape, 1990) and &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; (Bloodaxe Books, 1994). 

He was the leading light of a band, the Liverpool Scene, which released four LPs of poetry and music. Earlier, in 1955, he had played washboard in the King&#x27;s College, Newcastle&#x27;s, skiffle group. He was a firm believer in live poetry reading, and read his poetry at many and varied venues as well as holding poetry workshops at schools and colleges. One of his last major poetry readings was at the launch of &quot;The Argotist&quot; magazine in 1996.

In 1986 Henri became the first President of the National Acrylic Painters&#x27; Association, a post he held until 1991, after which he became its first Fellow and Patron until his death in 2000.

He died in Liverpool, aged 68, having never properly recovered from a stroke that he had suffered two years previously. The night before his death, Liverpool City Council conferred on him the Freedom of the City in recognition of his contribution to Liverpool&#x27;s cultural scene. He also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Liverpool.

He described his early philosophy as &quot;If you think you can do it and you want to do it—then do it.&quot;

In 2012 &quot;Adrian Henri: Total Artist&quot; was released. &quot;Total Artist&quot; concentrates on Henri&#x27;s work from the 1960s and 1970s, as well as capturing some of the excitement and dynamics of the art scene in Britain during this time. Henri was at the centre of a distinctive yet highly connected counter-culture, providing an opportunity to consider his embrace of total art as a template for interdisciplinary art practice. Published by Occasional Papers, the Exhibition Research Centre, Liverpool John Moores University and Université Paris Diderot.

==The Liverpool Scene==
The Liverpool Scene was a poetry band, formed around 1967, which included Adrian Henri, Andy Roberts, Mike Evans, Mike Hart (ex Liverpool Roadrunners), Percy Jones and Brian Dodson. Four LPs were issued with Henri&#x27;s poetry heavily featured. The first one was produced by Liverpool DJ John Peel, who was then working on the pirate radio station Radio London. Despite his support, the album achieved little success: the following three were equally unsuccessful. Public performances by the band included a (financially unsuccessful) 1969 tour when they opened for Led Zeppelin. Henri was described in performance as &quot;bouncing thunderously and at risk to audience and fellow performers, the stage vibrating out of rhythm beneath him.&quot; The Liverpool Scene disbanded in April 1970.

The albums were:
*&quot;The Incredible New Liverpool Scene&quot;
*&quot;The Amazing Adventures Of&quot;
*&quot;Bread on the Night&quot;
*&quot;St. Adrian &amp; Co., Broadway and 3rd&quot;
*&quot;Heirloon&quot; (rarities and outtakes)
There were at least three &quot;best of&quot; albums and two non-LP singles, &quot;Love Is&quot;/&quot;The Woo-Woo&quot; and &quot;Son, Son&quot;/&quot;Baby&quot;.

<text>In baseball, a position player is a player who on defense plays as an infielder, outfielder, or catcher. A pitcher is generally not considered a position player. A designated hitter, who bats but does not play any defensive position, is also not considered a position player.
Position players are eligible to pitch, and a manager will use a position player as a relief pitcher on some occasions. This typically happens if a game is a blowout, if no other pitchers are available, or if the game has gone well into extra innings.
==In other sports==
In ice hockey, &quot;position player&quot; refers to all non-goaltender players (forwards and defencemen), although &quot;skater&quot; is the more common term.

<doc id="1035086" wikidata="Q854573" url="?curid=1035086" title="Acute pancreatitis">
<text>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas. Causes include a gallstone impacted in the common bile duct or the pancreatic duct, heavy alcohol use, systemic disease, trauma, elevated calcium levels, hypertriglyceridemia (with triglycerides usually being very elevated, over 1000 mg/dL), certain medications, hereditary causes and, in children, mumps. Acute pancreatitis may be a single event, it may be recurrent, or it may progress to chronic pancreatitis and/or pancreatic failure (the term pancreatic dysfunction includes cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis where the pancreas is measurably damaged, even if it has not failed).

In all cases of acute pancreatitis, early intravenous fluid hydration and early enteral (nutrition delivered to the gut, either by mouth or via a feeding tube) feeding are associated with lower mortality and complications. Mild cases are usually successfully treated with conservative measures such as hospitalization with intravenous fluid infusion, pain control, and early enteral feeding. If a person is not able to tolerate feeding by mouth, feeding via nasogastric or nasojejunal tubes are frequently used which provide nutrition directly to the stomach or intestines respectively. Severe cases often require admission to an intensive care unit. Severe pancreatitis, which by definition includes organ damage other than the pancreas, is associated with a mortality rate of 20%. The condition is characterized by the pancreas secreting active enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase, instead of their inactive forms, leading to auto-digestion of the pancreas. Calcium helps to convert trypsinogen to the active trypsin, thus elevated calcium (of any cause) is a potential cause of pancreatitis. Damage to the pancreatic ducts can occur as a result of this. Long term complications include type 3c diabetes (pancreatogenic diabetes), in which the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin due to structural damage. 35% develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in which the pancreas is unable to secrete digestive enzymes due to structural damage, leading to malabsorption. 
== Signs and symptoms ==

===Common===
Common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and low to moderate grade fever. The abdominal pain is the most common symptom and it is usually described as being in the left upper quadrant, epigastric area or around the umbilicus, with radiation throughout the abdomen, or to the chest or back. The abdominal pain initially may worsen with eating or drinking but may become constant as the disease progresses. Less common symptoms include hiccups, abdominal bloating and indigestion. Although these are common symptoms, frequently they are not all present; and epigastric pain may be the only symptom.

Grey-Turner&#x27;s sign (hemorrhagic discoloration of the flanks) or Cullen&#x27;s sign (hemorrhagic discoloration of the umbilicus) are associated with severe disease. However both signs are rare (occurring in less than 1% of cases of acute pancreatitis) and are not specific nor sensitive for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Pleural effusions (fluid in the lung cavity) may occur in up to 34% of people with acute pancreatitis and are associated with a poor prognosis. The Mayo-Robson&#x27;s sign (pain while pressing at the top of the angle lateral to the erector spinae muscles and below the left 12th rib (left costovertebral angle (CVA)) is also associated with acute pancreatitis.

=== Complications ===
Complications of acute pancreatitis may occur. Necrotic pancreatitis occurs when inflammation of the pancreas progresses to cell death. Acute fluid collections may form adjacent to the pancreas or necrotic collections (discrete areas of dead tissue) may also form adjacent to or within the pancreas. These may progress to pancreatic pseudocysts and walled off areas of dead tissue which may persist for longer than 4 weeks. Both can become secondarily infected. Other complications include gastric outlet obstruction splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, hemorrhage from erosions into splenic artery and vein, blood clot of the splenic vein, superior mesenteric vein and portal veins, duodenal obstruction, common bile duct obstruction, progression to chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic ascites, or pleural effusion.

Systemic complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hypocalcemia (from fat saponification), hyperglycemia and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (from pancreatic insulin-producing beta cell damage), and malabsorption due to exocrine failure.

Tobacco use, recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic tissue death, alcoholic pancreatitis are all risk factors for developing chronic pancreatitis.

== Causes ==

=== Most common ===
* Biliary pancreatitis due to gallstones or constriction of ampulla of Vater in 40% of cases
* Alcohol in 30% of cases
* Idiopathic in 15–25% of cases
* Metabolic disorders: hereditary pancreatitis, hypercalcemia, elevated triglycerides, malnutrition
* May occur after instrumentation of the pancreatic duct or its opening to the duodenum (ampula of Vater) in procedures such as an endoscopic ultrasound or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The risk after EUS is less than 1% and the risk after ERCP is 5-10%.
* Abdominal trauma
* Penetrating ulcers
* Carcinoma of the head of pancreas, and other cancer
* Drugs: acetaminophen with or without codeine, amiodarone, azathioprine, carbamazepine, cimetidine, cisplatin, clomiphene, enalapril, estrogen containing products or hormones, furosemide, isoniazid, metronidazole, methyldopa, pravastatin, valproic acid 
* Infections: mumps, viral hepatitis, coxsackie B virus, cytomegalovirus, &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Ascaris&quot;
* Structural abnormalities: pancreas divisum, pancreatic masses or cysts that block the ducts.
* Radiotherapy
* Autoimmune pancreatitis
* Severe hypertriglyceridemia

=== Less common ===
* Scorpion venom
* Chinese liver fluke
* Ischemia from bypass surgery
* Heart valve surgery
* Fat necrosis
* Pregnancy
* Infections other than mumps, including varicella zoster
* Hyperparathyroidism
* Cystic fibrosis
* Anorexia or bulimia

== Pathology ==

===Pathogenesis===
Acute pancreatitis occurs when there is abnormal activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas. This occurs through inappropriate activation of inactive enzyme precursors called zymogens (or proenzymes) inside the pancreas, most notably trypsinogen. Normally, trypsinogen is converted to its active form (trypsin) in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), where the enzyme assists in the digestion of proteins. During an episode of acute pancreatitis, trypsinogen comes into contact with lysosomal enzymes (specifically cathepsin), which activate trypsinogen to trypsin. The active form trypsin then leads to further activation of other molecules of trypsinogen. The activation of these digestive enzymes lead to inflammation, edema, vascular injury, and even cellular death. The death of pancreatic cells occurs via two main mechanisms: apoptosis, which is physiologically controlled, and necrosis, which is less organized and more damaging. The balance between these two mechanisms of cellular death is mediated by caspases which regulate apoptosis and have important anti-necrosis functions during pancreatitis: preventing trypsinogen activation, preventing ATP depletion through inhibiting polyADP-ribose polymerase, and by inhibiting the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). If, however, the caspases are depleted due to either chronic ethanol exposure or through a severe insult then necrosis can predominate.

===Pathophysiology===
The two types of acute pancreatitis are mild and severe, which are defined based on whether the predominant response to cell injury is inflammation (mild) or necrosis (severe). In mild pancreatitis, there is inflammation and edema of the pancreas. In severe pancreatitis, there is necrosis of the pancreas, and nearby organs may become injured.

As part of the initial injury there is an extensive inflammatory response due to pancreatic cells synthesizing and secreting inflammatory mediators: primarily TNF-alpha and IL-1. A hallmark of acute pancreatitis is a manifestation of the inflammatory response, namely the recruitment of neutrophils to the pancreas. The inflammatory response leads to the secondary manifestations of pancreatitis: hypovolemia from capillary permeability, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulations, renal failure, cardiovascular failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

=== Histopathology ===
The acute pancreatitis (acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis) is characterized by acute inflammation and necrosis of pancreas parenchyma, focal enzymic necrosis of pancreatic fat and vessel necrosis (hemorrhage). These are produced by intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes. Lipase activation produces the necrosis of fat tissue in pancreatic interstitium and peripancreatic spaces as well as vessel damage. Necrotic fat cells appear as shadows, contours of cells, lacking the nucleus, pink, finely granular cytoplasm. It is possible to find calcium precipitates (). Digestion of vascular walls results in thrombosis and hemorrhage. Inflammatory infiltrate is rich in neutrophils. Due to the pancreas lacking a capsule, the inflammation and necrosis can extend to include fascial layers in the immediate vicinity of the pancreas.

== Diagnosis ==
Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed using clinical history and physical examination findings supporting the diagnosis with imaging and pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase). The Revised Atlanta Classification requires two out of three of the following findings for the diagnosis: abdominal pain consistent with pancreatitis, elevated amylase or lipase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and imaging consistent with acute pancreatitis. Additional labs may be used to identify organ failure for prognostic purposes or to guide fluid resuscitation rate. If the lipase level is about 2.5 to 3 times that of amylase, it is an indication of pancreatitis due to alcohol. Serum lipase is more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, and is the preferred test in the diagnosis.

Most, but not all individual studies support favor the diagnostic utility of lipase. In one large study, there were no patients with pancreatitis who had an elevated amylase with a normal lipase. Another study found that the amylase could add diagnostic value to the lipase, but only if the results of the two tests were combined with a discriminant function equation.

Reduced lipase clearance due to kidney disease, gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary cancers, pancreatic enzyme hypersecretion, critical illness including due to neurosurgical causes have been shown to increase serum lipase and may complicate the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
The differential diagnosis includes:
* Perforated peptic ulcer
* Biliary colic
* Acute cholecystitis
* Pneumonia
* Pleuritic pain
* Myocardial infarction

=== Computed tomography ===

Regarding the need for computed tomography, practice guidelines state:

CT is an important common initial assessment tool for acute pancreatitis. Imaging is indicated during the initial presentation if:
* the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is uncertain
* there is abdominal distension and tenderness, fever &gt;102 F (38,9 C), or leukocytosis
* there is a Ranson score &gt; 3 or APACHE score &gt; 8
* there is no improvement after 72 hours of conservative medical therapy
* there has been an acute change in status: fever, pain, or shock

CT is recommended as a delayed assessment tool in the following situations:
* acute change in status
* to determine therapeutic response after surgery or interventional radiologic procedure
* before discharge in patients with severe acute pancreatitis

Abdominal CT should not be performed before the first 12 hours of onset of symptoms as early CT (&lt;12 hours) may result in equivocal or normal findings.

CT findings can be classified into the following categories for easy recall:
* Intrapancreatic – diffuse or segmental enlargement, edema, gas bubbles, pancreatic pseudocysts and phlegmons/abscesses (which present 4 to 6 wks after initial onset)
* Peripancreatic / extrapancreatic – irregular pancreatic outline, obliterated peripancreatic fat, retroperitoneal edema, fluid in the lessar sac, fluid in the left anterior pararenal space
* Locoregional – Gerota&#x27;s fascia sign (thickening of inflamed Gerota&#x27;s fascia, which becomes visible), pancreatic ascites, pleural effusion (seen on basal cuts of the pleural cavity), adynamic ileus, etc.

The principal value of CT imaging to the treating clinician is the capacity to identify devitalized areas of the pancreas which have become necrotic due to ischaemia. Pancreatic necrosis can be reliably identified by intravenous contrast-enhanced CT imaging, and is of value if infection occurs and surgical or percutaneous debridement is indicated.

=== Magnetic resonance imaging ===
While computed tomography is considered the gold standard in diagnostic imaging for acute pancreatitis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly valuable as a tool for the visualization of the pancreas, particularly of pancreatic fluid collections and necrotized debris. Additional utility of MRI includes its indication for imaging of patients with an allergy to CT&#x27;s contrast material, and an overall greater sensitivity to hemorrhage, vascular complications, pseudoaneurysms, and venous thrombosis.

Another advantage of MRI is its utilization of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) sequences. MRCP provides useful information regarding the etiology of acute pancreatitis, i.e., the presence of tiny biliary stones (choledocholithiasis or cholelithiasis) and duct anomalies. Clinical trials indicate that MRCP can be as effective a diagnostic tool for acute pancreatitis with biliary etiology as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but with the benefits of being less invasive and causing fewer complications.

=== Ultrasound ===

Ultrasound is less preferred as a diagnostic test for acute pancreatitis, but it may be used in select cases. Abdominal ultrasonography may be obtained if there is concern of a gallstone blocking the pancreatic duct leading to pancreatitis.

== Treatment ==
Early enteral (nutrition given directly to the gut, either by mouth or via feeding tube) nutrition and aggressive intravenous fluid hydration are indicated in all forms and severities of acute pancreatitis and are associated with lower mortality and complications.

=== Fluid replacement ===
The specific rate of intravenous fluid replacement in acute pancreatitis is not well established but some experts recommend an initial fluid infusion rate of 5-10 mL of IV fluids per kilogram of body weight per hour and adjusting the rate to meet physiologic parameters such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, urine output and hematocrit.

Isotonic crystalloid solutions (such as lactated ringers) are preferred over normal saline for fluid resuscitation and are associated with a lower risk of developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

In the initial stages (within the first 12 to 24 hours) of acute pancreatitis, fluid replacement has been associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality.

=== Pain control ===
Abdominal pain is often the predominant symptom in patients with acute pancreatitis and should be treated with analgesics.

Opioids are safe and effective at providing pain control in patients with acute pancreatitis. Adequate pain control requires the use of intravenous opiates, usually in the form of a patient-controlled analgesia pump. Hydromorphone or fentanyl (intravenous) may be used for pain relief in acute pancreatitis. Fentanyl is being increasingly used due to its better safety profile, especially in renal impairment. As with other opiates, fentanyl can depress respiratory function. It can be given both as a bolus as well as constant infusion.
Meperidine has been historically favored over morphine because of the belief that morphine caused an increase in sphincter of Oddi pressure. However, no clinical studies suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause pancreatitis or cholecystitis. In addition, meperidine has a short half-life and repeated doses can lead to accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine, which causes neuromuscular side effects and, rarely, seizures.

=== Nutritional support ===
Acute pancreatitis is a catabolic state and with hemodynamic instability or fluid shifts or edema there may be reduced intravascular perfusion to the gut. This reduction in gut perfusion increases the risk of gut necrosis with bacterial translocation with the subsequent risk of sepsis or secondary infections. Enteral nutrition gives one needed caloric intake as well as enhances intestinal motility and blood flow to the gut, reducing these risks. Enteral nutrition (as compared to parenteral nutrition, in which nutrients are given via intravenous infusion) is associated with reduced mortality, reduced risk of multi-organ failure and systemic infection in those with acute pancreatitis. In patients with acute pancreatitis, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommends early oral nutrition, within 24 hours, rather than keeping the patient fastng (or nothing by mouth). And in those unable to feed orally, the AGA recommends enteral nutrition (via a nasogastric or nasojejunal tube) rather than parenteral nutrition.

=== Antibiotics ===
Up to 20 percent of people with acute pancreatitis develop an infection outside the pancreas such as bloodstream infections, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections. These infections are associated with an increase in mortality. Fluid collections around the pancreas or areas within the pancreas that experience tissue death (necrosis) may also become secondarily infected requiring the use of antibiotics. When an infection is suspected, antibiotics should be started while the source of the infection is being determined. However, if cultures are negative and no source of infection is identified, antibiotics should be discontinued.

Preventative antibiotics are not recommended in people with acute pancreatitis, regardless of the type (interstitial or necrotizing) or disease severity (mild, moderately severe, or severe)

===Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography===
In 30% of those with acute pancreatitis, no cause is identified. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with empirical biliary sphincterotomy has an equal chance of causing complications and treating the underlying cause, therefore, is not recommended for treating acute pancreatitis. If a gallstone is detected, ERCP, performed within 24 to 72 hours of presentation with successful removal of the stone, is known to reduce morbidity and mortality. The indications for early ERCP are:
* Clinical deterioration or lack of improvement after 24 hours
* Detection of common bile duct stones or dilated intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts on abdominal CT

The risks of ERCP are that it may worsen pancreatitis, it may introduce an infection to otherwise sterile pancreatitis, and bleeding.

=== Surgery ===
In those with mild acute pancreatitis due to gallstones, cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is recommended in the hospital and is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatitis recurrence. In those with gallstone pancreatitis who have severe disease, including the presence of peripancreatic fluid collections, cholecystectomy should be delayed as the fluid collections around the pancreas make surgery technically difficult. The peri-pancreatic fluids also carry a risk of becoming secondarily infected with surgery.

Surgery is indicated for (i) infected pancreatic necrosis and (ii) diagnostic uncertainty and (iii) complications. The most common cause of death in acute pancreatitis is secondary infection. Infection is diagnosed based on 2 criteria
* Gas bubbles on CT scan (present in 20 to 50% of infected necrosis)
* Positive bacterial culture on FNA (fine needle aspiration, usually CT or US guided) of the pancreas.

Surgical options for infected necrosis include:
* Minimally invasive management – necrosectomy through small incision in skin (left flank) or abdomen
* Conventional management – necrosectomy with simple drainage
* Closed management – necrosectomy with closed continuous postoperative lavage
* Open management – necrosectomy with planned staged reoperations at definite intervals (up to 20+ reoperations in some cases)

=== Other measures ===
* Pancreatic enzyme inhibitors are proven not to work.
* The use of octreotide has been shown not to improve outcomes.

== Classification by severity: prognostic scoring systems ==
Acute pancreatitis patients recover in majority of cases. Some may develop abscess, pseudocyst or duodenal obstruction. About 20% of the acute pancreatitis are severe with a mortality of about 20%.
Acute pancreatitis can be further divided into mild and severe pancreatitis. Several clinical scoring tools have been developed to determine prognostic information and may guide certain areas of clinical management, such as need for ICU admission.

Two such scoring systems are the Ranson criteria and APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) indices. Most, but not all studies report that the Apache score may be more accurate. In the negative study of the APACHE-II, the APACHE-II 24-hour score was used rather than the 48-hour score.
Some experts recommend using the APACHE II score as well as a serum hematocrit level early during the admission as prognostic indicators.

===Ranson score===

The Ranson score is used to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis. They were introduced in 1974.

====At admission====
* age in years &gt; 55 years
* white blood cell count &gt; 16000 cells/mm3
* blood glucose &gt; 11.1 mmol/L (&gt; 200 mg/dL)
* serum AST &gt; 250 IU/L
* serum LDH &gt; 350 IU/L

====At 48 hours====
* Calcium (serum calcium &lt; 2.0 mmol/L (&lt; 8.0 mg/dL)
* Hematocrit fall &gt;10%
* Oxygen (hypoxemia PO2 &lt; 60 mmHg)
* BUN increased by 1.8 or more mmol/L (5 or more mg/dL) after IV fluid hydration
* Base deficit (negative base excess) &gt; 4 mEq/L
* Sequestration of fluids &gt; 6 L
The criteria for point assignment is that a certain breakpoint be met at any time during that 48 hour period, so that in some situations it can be calculated shortly after admission. It is applicable to both gallstone and alcoholic pancreatitis.

Alternatively, pancreatitis can be diagnosed by meeting any of the following:[2]

===Alternative Ranson score===
Ranson&#x27;s score of ≥ 8
Organ failure
Substantial pancreatic necrosis (at least 30% glandular necrosis according to contrast-enhanced CT)

Interpretation
If the score ≥ 3, severe pancreatitis likely.
If the score &lt; 3, severe pancreatitis is unlikely
Or

Score 0 to 2 : 2% mortality
Score 3 to 4 : 15% mortality
Score 5 to 6 : 40% mortality
Score 7 to 8 : 100% mortality

===APACHE II score===

&quot;Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation&quot; (APACHE II) score &gt; 8 points predicts 11% to 18% mortality
* Hemorrhagic peritoneal fluid
* Obesity
* Indicators of organ failure
* Hypotension (SBP &lt;90 mmHG) or tachycardia &gt; 130 beat/min
* PO2 &lt;60 mmHg
* Oliguria (&lt;50 mL/h) or increasing BUN and creatinine
* Serum calcium &lt; 1.90 mmol/L (&lt;8.0 mg/dL) or serum albumin &lt;33 g/L (&lt;3.2.g/dL)&gt;

===Balthazar score===
Developed in the early 1990s by Emil J. Balthazar &quot;et al.&quot;, the Computed Tomography Severity Index (CTSI) is a grading system used to determine the severity of acute pancreatitis. The numerical CTSI has a maximum of ten points, and is the sum of the Balthazar grade points and pancreatic necrosis grade points:

Balthazar grade

Necrosis score

CTSI&#x27;s staging of acute pancreatitis severity has been shown by a number of studies to provide more accurate assessment than APACHE II, Ranson, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. However, a few studies indicate that CTSI is not significantly associated with the prognosis of hospitalization in patients with pancreatic necrosis, nor is it an accurate predictor of AP severity.

=== Glasgow score ===

The Glasgow score is valid for both gallstone and alcohol induced pancreatitis, whereas the Ranson score is only for alcohol induced pancreatitis. If a patient scores 3 or more it indicates severe pancreatitis and the patient should be considered for transfer to ITU. It is scored through the mnemonic, PANCREAS:
* P – PaO2 &lt;8kPa
* A – Age &gt;55-years-old
* N – Neutrophilia: WCC &gt;15x10(9)/L
* C – Calcium &lt;2 mmol/L
* R – Renal function: Urea &gt;16 mmol/L
* E – Enzymes: LDH &gt;600iu/L; AST &gt;200iu/L
* A – Albumin &lt;32g/L (serum)
* S – Sugar: blood glucose &gt;10 mmol/L

===BISAP score===
Predicts mortality risk in pancreatitis with fewer variables than Ranson&#x27;s criteria. Data should be taken from the first 24 hours of the patient&#x27;s evaluation.
* BUN &gt;25 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L)
* Abnormal mental status with a Glasgow coma score &lt;15
* Evidence of SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)
* Patient age &gt;60 years old
* Imaging study reveals pleural effusion

Patients with a score of zero had a mortality of less than one percent, whereas patients with a score of five had a mortality rate of 22 percent. In the validation cohort, the BISAP score had similar test performance characteristics for predicting mortality as the APACHE II score. As is a problem with many of the other scoring systems, the BISAP has not been validated for predicting outcomes such as length of hospital stay, need for ICU care, or need for intervention.

== Epidemiology ==
The worldwide incidence of acute pancreatitis has increasing from 1961 to 2016 with an average annual percentage increase of 3%, the increased incidence was seen in North America and Europe. The incidence of acute pancreatitis in the United States is 110-140 cases per 100,000 people.

In the United States the most common causes include gallstones, which are responsible for 21-33% of cases, followed by alcohol (16-27%) and elevated triglycerides (2-5%).

<doc id="1035091" wikidata="Q1591372" url="?curid=1035091" title="Quartz Compositor">
<text>Quartz Compositor is the display server (and at the same time the compositing window manager) in macOS. It is responsible for presenting and maintaining rasterized, rendered graphics from the rest of the Core Graphics framework and other renderers in the Quartz technologies family.

== Overview ==
The bitmap output from Quartz 2D, OpenGL, Core Image, QuickTime, or other process is written to a specific memory location, or &quot;backing store&quot;. The Compositor then reads the data from the backing stores and assembles each into one image for the display, writing that image to the frame buffer memory of the graphics card. Quartz Compositor only accepts raster data, and is the only process that can directly access the graphics frame buffer.

In managing individual windows, Quartz Compositor accepts a bitmap image of the window&#x27;s contents from its renderer, along with its position. The choice of the renderer is up to the individual application, although most use Quartz 2D. Quartz Compositor then acts as a &quot;visual mixing board,&quot; by adding the given window to the whole scene for the display.

In its role as window manager, Quartz Compositor also has an event queue which receives events, such as key strokes and mouse clicks. The Quartz Compositor takes the events from the queue, determines which process owns the window where the event occurred, and passes the event on to the process.

== Quartz Extreme ==
Mac OS X v10.2 introduced Quartz Extreme: graphics processor (GPU) acceleration for the Quartz Compositor. With Quartz Extreme, far fewer central processing unit (CPU) cycles are needed for scene composition. Instead, the Quartz Compositor encapsulates each rendered backing store in an OpenGL texture map or surface. It then directs the GPU to compose the surfaces and maps to provide the final image, which is delivered to the frame buffer.

Quartz Extreme only uses OpenGL commands, and requires a graphics card connected to an AGP 2X or faster bus (including AGP 4X, 8X, and PCI Express), supporting textures and maps of arbitrary size, since many of the renderers have no size limitation (Quartz 2D for example). In Mac OS X Tiger, it is automatically enabled on Mac systems with one of the following types of graphics cards:
* AMD (ATI) Radeon, AGP-based, 16 MB VRAM minimum, or better
* NVIDIA GeForce2 MX, 16 MB VRAM minimum, or better

As of OS X El Capitan, Quartz Extreme is enabled on all supported Macs.

== QuartzGL ==
QuartzGL (called Quartz 2D Extreme when it was introduced in Mac OS X Tiger) is GPU acceleration for the Quartz 2D API. With QuartzGL enabled, all Quartz drawing commands are translated to OpenGL commands and executed on the GPU. This differs from Quartz Extreme, which still executes Quartz drawing commands on the CPU but performs final composition using the GPU.

As of OS X Mountain Lion, QuartzGL is still not enabled by default. However, it is possible to enable it using the Quartz Debug application included in the Apple Developer Tools. QuartzGL will be disabled once again upon quitting the Quartz Debug utility. A workaround is to force quit the Quartz Debug application, which will leave QuartzGL enabled system-wide.

All graphics cards capable of supporting Core Image also support QuartzGL.

<doc id="1035114" wikidata="Q457031" url="?curid=1035114" title="Volksgemeinschaft">
<text>Volksgemeinschaft () is a German expression meaning &quot;people&#x27;s community&quot;, &quot;folk community&quot;, &quot;national community&quot;, or &quot;racial community&quot;, depending on the translation of its component term &quot;Volk&quot; (cognate with the English word &quot;folk&quot;). This expression originally became popular during World War I as Germans rallied in support of the war, and many experienced &quot;relief that at one fell swoop all social and political divisions could be solved in the great national equation&quot;. The idea of a &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was rooted in the notion of uniting people across class divides to achieve a national purpose, and the hope that national unity would &quot;obliterate all conflicts - between employers and employees, town and countryside, producers and consumers, industry and craft&quot;.

After the November Revolution of 1918, the overthrow of the constitutional monarchy, and Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, the concept of &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; remained popular especially on the right wing of German politics, in opposition to the class struggle advocated by Marxist parties like the Social Democrats and the Communists. The monarchist German Conservative Party became the German National People&#x27;s Party (DVNP) and the National Liberal Party reorganized itself into the German People&#x27;s Party, with the new names intended partly as references to &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;. 

The concept was notoriously embraced by the newly founded Nazi Party in the 1920s, and eventually became strongly associated with Nazism after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. In the Nazi vision of &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;, society would continue to be organized into classes (based upon talent, property, or profession), but there would be no class conflict, because a common national consciousness would inspire the different economic and social classes to live together harmoniously and work for the nation. There was also an important racial aspect to the Nazi &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;: only &quot;people of Aryan blood&quot; could be members.

==Development==
The word &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was probably first used in Gottlob August Tittel&#x27;s 1791 translation of a text written by John Locke, synthesising the expression &quot;in any place, generally&quot;. Among 19th century scholars who used the word &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; were Friedrich Schleiermacher, Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Carl Theodor Welcker, Johann Caspar Bluntschli, Hermann Schulze, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Wilhelm Wundt. Most influential was perhaps Ferdinand Tönnies&#x27; theory in his work &quot;Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Community and Society&quot;) of 1887. Decades later, in 1932, Tönnies joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany to oppose the rise of Nazism and protest against their use of his concept. He had his honorary professorship removed when Adolf Hitler came to power.

In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, the Emperor Wilhelm II proclaimed before the &quot;Reichstag&quot; the &quot;Burgfrieden&quot; (&quot;peace in the castle&quot; or &quot;truce in the castle&quot;, a kind of &quot;unity within a besieged castle&quot; for the duration of the conflict), announcing that henceforward all of the regional differences between the different states of the &quot;Reich&quot;; between rich, middle class and poor; between Roman Catholics and Protestants; and between rural and urban were no longer relevant and the German people were all one for the duration of the war. During the war, many Germans longed to have the sense of unity that the &quot;Burgfrieden&quot; inspired continue after the war, and it was during this period that many ideas started to circulate about how to convert the wartime &quot;Burgfrieden&quot; into a peacetime &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;. People who belonged to the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; were known as &quot;Volksgenossen&quot; (fellow members).

In the aftermath of World War I, the idea of &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was used to interpret economic catastrophes and hardship facing Germans during the Weimar Republic era as a common experience of the German nation and to argue for German unity to bring about renewal to end the crisis. It was invoked by the Jewish social anarchists Gustav Landauer (who was killed for his participation in the Bavarian Soviet Republic) and Erich Mühsam (who died in Oranienburg concentration camp) in articulating their vision of a peaceful, non-coercive mutualist society. However, it was subsequently adopted by the Nazi Party to justify actions against Jews, profiteers, Marxists, and the Allies of World War I, whom the Nazis accused of obstructing German national regeneration, causing national disintegration in 1918 and Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I.

There is an ongoing debate among historians as to whether a &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was or was not successfully established between 1933 and 1945. This is a notably controversial topic of debate for ethical and political reasons, and is made difficult by the ambiguous language employed by Hitler and the Nazis when talking about the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;.

==Nazi &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;==

In the aftermath of the November Revolution of 1918 that marked the end of the German Empire and the beginning of the Weimar Republic, there was strong animosity amongst many Germans towards the Weimar Republic and the social democrats who sponsored its creation. This was combined with anxiety in the 1930s and with the severe economic crisis in Germany and abroad, in which many Germans faced unemployment. This situation resulted in increasing popularity for the Nazi Party, including amongst workers, small business owners, and others who desired a government that would resolve the economic crisis. While ascending to power, Hitler promised to restore faith in the &quot;Volk&quot; and to bring wholeness while accusing other politicians of tearing at German unity.
Upon rising to power in 1933, the Nazis sought to gain support of various elements of society. Their concept of &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was racially unified and organized hierarchically. This involved a mystical unity, a form of racial soul uniting all Germans, including those living abroad. Nevertheless, this soul was regarded as related to the land, in the doctrine of &quot;blood and soil&quot;. Indeed, one reason for &quot;blood and soil&quot; was the belief that landowner and peasant lived in an organic harmony. Aryan Germans who had sexual relations with non-Germanics were excluded from the people&#x27;s community.

The Nazis solidified support amongst nationalists and conservatives by presenting themselves as allied with President Paul von Hindenburg, who was considered a war hero of World War I in Germany. On 21 March 1933, special celebrations were held to mark the re-opening of the Reichstag following the Reichstag fire, and the Nazis called this event Potsdam Day. Potsdam Day was used to celebrate military tradition, the Hohenzollern dynasty of Prussia, the sacrifices of World War I and the &quot;hero of Tannenberg,&quot; President Hindenburg. The image of Hitler and Hindenburg shaking hands was reproduced on thousands of postcards, representing &quot;the union of the new and old Germany,&quot; a way for the Nazis to portray themselves as connected to the aristocratic traditions of the past.

Having organized Potsdam Day to gain conservative support, the Nazis sought to gain the support of workers by declaring May Day, a day celebrated by organized labour, to be a paid holiday named the &quot;Day of National Work&quot; and held celebrations on 1 May 1933 to honour German workers. The regime believed that the only way to avoid a repeat of the disaster of 1918 was to secure workers&#x27; support for the German government. The regime also insisted through propaganda that all Germans take part in the May Day celebrations, not just workers, in the hope that this would help break down class hostility between workers and burghers. Songs in praise of labour and workers were played by state radio throughout May Day 1933, as well as an airshow in Berlin and fireworks. The Nazis added strongly nationalist themes to the celebrations, and Hitler spoke of workers as patriots who had built Germany&#x27;s industrial strength and had honourably served in the war, while claiming that they had been oppressed under economic liberalism. Hitler praised the virtues of labor, and was quoted in the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; as declaring that &quot;I only acknowledge one nobility—that of labour.&quot; The event proved convincing, as the next day the &quot;Berliner Morgenpost&quot;, a newspaper which had been associated with the political left in the past, praised the regime&#x27;s May Day celebrations. At the same time, however, the Nazis sought to destroy independent working class organizations, seeing them as incompatible with the trans-class unity of the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;. On 2 May 1933, one day after the celebrations, the trade union movement was banned, and &quot;stormtroopers sealed off and took over the operations of the socialist Free Trade Unions and incorporated them into what became the German Labor Front&quot;.

The Nazis continued social welfare policies initiated by the governments of the Weimar Republic and mobilized volunteers to assist those impoverished, &quot;racially-worthy&quot; Germans through the National Socialist People&#x27;s Welfare organization. This organization oversaw charitable activities, and became the largest civic organization in Nazi Germany. Successful efforts were made to get middle-class women involved in social work assisting large families. The Winter Relief campaigns acted as a ritual to generate public feeling. These efforts also served to reinforce the racial ideology of the Nazis and the idea that the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was a racial community, because Jews and other non-Aryans were excluded from social welfare benefits, as were Germans who opposed Nazism or who were deemed &quot;unfit&quot; for other reasons.

The &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was intended to create a sense of uniformity amongst its members; Fritz Reinhardt, state secretary for the finance ministry, introduced numerous tax breaks for lower and middle class Germans, narrowed pension gaps between blue and white collar workers, and lowered the entrance standards for civil service exams. The ubiquitous uniforms within Nazi organisations were intended to suppress visible class differences in dress and create an image of unity. Between 1933 and 1939, upward mobility was twice as likely as between 1927 and 1933. The Second World War assisted in this, as social status and class did not affect whether one received Reich services. Wartime rationing was implemented in an egalitarian manner, which greatly pleased the working class – a secret wartime report by the Social Democrats stated that &quot;the working classes thoroughly welcome the fact that &#x27;the better off&#x27; have, in practical terms, ceased to be that.&quot;

Nevertheless, in many ways the Nazi &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; served only as a symbolic unity, while real differences of status and wealth continued to dominate daily life. The Nazis disparaged sophisticated forms of address such as &quot;gnädige Frau&quot; (&quot;gracious lady&quot;) and the associated practice of kissing a lady&#x27;s hand, but Hitler was routinely shown engaging in that same practice in press photographs. Old titles of nobility were shunned, but the Nazi Party hierarchy created numerous new titles. Elegant evening dress and other public displays of wealth were sometimes derided and sometimes encouraged. The Nazi Party claimed to administer justice impartially to all ethnic Germans regardless of their social origins, and Nazi propaganda emphasized instances where upper class individuals were found guilty by the courts as evidence of this, but at the same time the Nazi Party provided many opportunities for corruption and vested interests among its members. On one occasion the arrest of a &quot;Reichsbank&quot; director was widely publicized by the Nazi press, while his subsequent release was never mentioned.

===In propaganda===
Nazis gave a great deal of prominence to this new &quot;folk community&quot; in their propaganda, depicting the events of 1933 as a &quot;Volkwerdung&quot;, or a people becoming itself. The &quot;Volk&quot; were not just a people; a mystical soul united them, and propaganda continually portrayed individuals as part of a great whole, worth dying for. A common Nazi mantra declared that ethnic Germans must put &quot;collective need ahead of individual greed&quot; and oppose class conflict, materialism, and profiteering in order to ensure the survival of the &quot;Volk&quot;—a widespread sentiment in this era. To exemplify and encourage such views, when the &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; and &quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot; collected donations for &quot;Winterhilfswerk&quot; (Winter Relief), totals were not reported for any individuals, only what the branch raised. The &quot;Winterhilfswerk&quot; campaigns themselves acted as a ritual to generate public feeling. Organisations and institutions such as &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;, &quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot;, &quot;Winterhilfswerk&quot;, but also the Reich Labour Service and, above all, the Nazi party were portrayed as exemplifications and concrete manifestations of the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;.

Hitler declared that he knew nothing of bourgeois or proletarian, only Germans. &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was portrayed as overcoming distinctions of party and social class. The commonality this created across classes was among the great appeals of Nazism.

After the failure of the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler, in the trial, omitted his usual pre-putsch anti-Semitism and centered his defense on his selfless devotion to the good of the &quot;Volk&quot; and the need for bold action to save them. The Versailles settlement had betrayed Germany, which they had tried to save. Thereafter, his speeches concentrated on his boundless devotion to the &quot;Volk&quot;, though not entirely eliminating the anti-Semitism. Even once in power, his immediate speeches spoke of serving Germany. While the Reichstag fire was used to justify anti-Communist and anti-Semitic violence, Hitler himself spoke on a new life, honor, and unity in Germany. Similarly, the Night of the Long Knives was justified as a peril to the people so great that only decisive action would save them. Goebbels described Hitler after that event as suffering &quot;tragic loneliness&quot; and as a Siegfried forced to shed blood to preserve Germany.

Devotion to this &quot;Volk&quot; is common in Nazi propaganda. An account, for instance, of a SA brawl depicted its leader as uncouth and therefore a simple, strong, and honest man of the people. &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; speakers were used, in part, for the appeal of their folksy manner. One element of Horst Wessel&#x27;s life that was fictionalized out of the movie &quot;Hans Westmar&quot; was the willful provoking of violent conflicts with Communists; Westmar preaches class reconciliation, and his death unifies students and workers. These ideas were also propagandized to the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;, whose violent, rebellious and confrontational past had to be transformed into a community organization to be useful in a Germany where Nazis held official power.

This unity was what justified Nazi propaganda; its pejorative connotation had sprung solely from its selfish use, and the Nazis&#x27; honorable goal, the unity of the German people, made it honorable for them.

It also justified the one-party state as all that was needed in a society with a united will, where Hitler implemented the will of the &quot;Volk&quot; more directly than in a democracy. Attacks on Great Britain as a plutocracy also emphasized how the German, being able to participate in his &quot;Volk&quot;, is freer than the Briton.

In his pamphlet &quot;State, Volk and Movement&quot;, Carl Schmitt praised the expulsion of Jews from political life without ever using the term &quot;Jew&quot; and using &quot;non-Aryan&quot; only rarely, by praising the homogeneity of the people and the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; ensuing; merely Gleichschaltung was not sufficient, but Nazi principles must continue to make the German people pure. Even Carl Jung&#x27;s &quot;collective unconscious&quot; was preferred to Freudian concepts because of its communal element.

The &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; was also depicted in films on the home-front during World War II, with the war uniting all levels of society, as in the two most popular films of the Nazi era, &quot;Die grosse Liebe&quot; and &quot;Wunschkonzert&quot;. The &quot;Request Concert&quot; radio show, on which the latter film was based, achieved great popularity by broadcasting music claimed to be requested by men in the armed forces. Attempts to get women of &quot;better classes&quot; to take factory jobs were presented as breaking down class barriers and so helping create a true people&#x27;s community. Failure to support the war was an anti-social act; this propaganda managed to bring arms production to a peak in 1944.

===Categories of Germans===
Nazi legal theory divided all Germans into two categories, namely the &quot;Volksgenossen&quot; (&quot;Fellow Members&quot;) who belonged to the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; and the &quot;Gemeinschaftsfremde&quot; (&quot;Community Aliens&quot;) who did not. In addition to the duties and responsibilities shared by those in the community, the &quot;Volksgenossen&quot; were expected to build and create a &quot;Volksgeist&quot; (&quot;&quot;Volk&quot; spirit&quot;) that would encompass the best aspects of the German people. As such, community aliens could not belong, since they were deemed an undermining element in the very foundations of the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;.

The modern German historian Detlev Peukert wrote the following about the purpose of Nazi social policy:

The goal was an utopian &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;, totally under police surveillance, in which any attempt at nonconformist behaviour, or even any hint or intention of such behaviour, would be visited with terror.
Criminals, if deemed unable to be part of the people&#x27;s community, were severely punished, even executed for crimes that did not provide for the death penalty, such as doubling the sentence the prosecution asked for when a defendant had not helped put out a fire, thus showing a disregard for the life of his &quot;Volksgenossen&quot; and community. In support of this, Peukert quoted two articles from the projected &quot;Law for the Treatment of Community Aliens&quot; of 1944, which though never implemented owing to bureaucratic quarrels showed the intentions of Nazi social policy:

===Children and youth===
In their desire to establish a total state, the Nazis understood the importance of “selling” their ideology to the youth. To accomplish this, Hitler established Nazi youth groups. Young boys from 6–10 years old participated in the &quot;Pimpfen&quot;, similar to the cub scouts. Boys from 10–14 years old participated in the &quot;Deutsches Jungvolk&quot;, and boys 14–18 years old participated in the &quot;Hitler Jugend&quot; (Hitler Youth). The two older groups fostered military values and virtues, such as duty, obedience, honor, courage, strength, and ruthlessness. Uniforms and regular military drills were supplemented by ceremonies honoring the war dead. Most importantly, the Hitler Youth did their utmost to indoctrinate the youth of Germany with the ideological values of Nazism. Youth leaders bore into the youth a sense of fervent patriotism and utter devotion to Hitler, including military training so as to be ready to join the Wehrmacht. By 1939, when membership in the Hitler Youth became compulsory, each new member of the Jungvolk was required to take an oath to the Führer swearing total allegiance.

Young girls were also a part of the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany. Girls from 10 to 14 years old were members of the &quot;Jungmädelbund&quot;, while girls fourteen to eighteen belonged to the &quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot;. Hitler youth girls were instructed in the principles of service, regimentation, obedience, and discipline. Girls were taught to be dutiful wives and mothers. Members of the &quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot; were educated in the skills needed for domestic chores, nursing, and hygiene.

In the early years of the Nazi regime, bonfires were made of school children&#x27;s differently colored caps as symbolic of the abolition of class differences. But by the end of the 1930s, most Hitler Youth officials were recruited from wealthier families, and the use of differently colored sashes had returned to schools.

Daily life in Nazi Germany was manipulated from the beginning of Nazi rule. Propaganda dominated popular culture and entertainment. Finally, Hitler and the party realized the possibilities of controlling Germany&#x27;s youth as a means of continuing the &quot;Reich&quot; as they wanted the generation of Germans to follow to be dedicated to the strengthening and preservation of the German &quot;Volk&quot; and of the &quot;Greater German Reich&quot;.

<text>Sir William Thomas White (13 November 186611 February 1955), was a Canadian politician and Cabinet minister. He served as minister of finance from 1911 to 1919 under Prime Minister Robert Borden. As finance minister, White introduced the income tax to help fund Canada&#x27;s World War I efforts.

== Early life ==

White worked as a reporter for the &quot;Toronto Evening Telegram&quot; in 1890, and subsequently worked for Toronto&#x27;s Assessment Department. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1895, and a law degree from Osgoode Law School in 1899. 

White did not practice law after his graduation, but instead worked as a Managing Director for the National Trust Company, Ltd., becoming its Vice-President in 1911. National Trust was incorporated in 1898 by Senator George Albertus Cox and Edward Rogers Wood. National Trust Company, Ltd. became part of Bank of Nova Scotia as Scotia Trust in 1997.

== Political career and finance minister ==

White was initially a Liberal party member, but his views diverged from the party&#x27;s policies on some key matters. He was a supporter of British imperialism, and joined Clifford Sifton and other Liberals in signing an anti - reciprocity manifesto in 1911.

Although he had few allies in the Conservative Party, White was respected by party leader Robert Borden, who recognized that White&#x27;s presence would bring some disaffected Liberals to the party. After winning the general election of 1911, Borden appointed White as his Minister of Finance. White did not hold a seat in the House of Commons of Canada at the time, and in fact had never campaigned for public office before. Nevertheless, he was elected by acclamation in a by-election in the eastern Ontario riding of Leeds, after another Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) was convinced to resign.

White was responsible for managing Canada&#x27;s finances during World War I. His approach was conservative, and he was reluctant to interfere with private enterprise or even to raise taxes in the early period of the war. Although he eventually made some interventions (including fixed profit margins and regulated food supplies), he continued to reject fundamental changes in the nation&#x27;s finances. One exception was the introduction in 1917 of an income tax of 4% on all income of single men over $2,000; for Canadians with annual incomes of more than $6,000, the tax rate ranged from 2 to 25 per cent. Though it was intended as a temporary war measure and despite White&#x27;s recommendation that &quot;a year or two after the war is over, the measure should be reviewed by the minister of finance of the day, with a view of judging whether it is suitable to the conditions which then prevail,&quot; income tax became a permanent feature of Canadian life.

In the 1916 New Year Honours, White was knighted a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George
(KCMG).

In 1919, he approved the use of naval warships to suppress post-war labour radicalism in British Columbia. White served as Finance Minister until August 1, 1919. From February 20 to May 23 of 1919, he also served as Acting Prime Minister while Borden was in Europe attending the Paris Peace Conference. Several members of Borden&#x27;s Unionist government (a wartime coalition of the Conservative Party and some Liberals) called on White to replace Borden as Prime Minister in 1920, but he declined.

In the 1920 New Year Honours, as a reward for his service as Acting Prime Minister, White was appointed to the Imperial Privy Council, allowing him to use the honorific &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. He remained a Member of Parliament until the 1921 election when he retired from politics. Later in the year, he published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Story of Canada&#x27;s War Finances&quot;, defending his management of the wartime economy.

== Later life ==

White did not consider himself as a &quot;career politician&quot;. His tenure as Finance Minister was very stressful, and he seems to have welcomed the opportunity to leave political life after the war&#x27;s end. There is no indication that he entertained a return to politics in later years.

In 1933, he served as a member of the Royal Commission on Banking and Currency. He opposed the creation of the Bank of Canada.

In the King&#x27;s 1935 Birthday Honours, he was promoted within the Order of St Michael and St George to a Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) &quot;For public services in the Dominion of Canada.&quot;

<doc id="1035125" wikidata="Q1996053" url="?curid=1035125" title="Chronic pancreatitis">
<text>Chronic pancreatitis is a long-standing inflammation of the pancreas that alters the organ&#x27;s normal structure and functions. It can present as episodes of acute inflammation in a previously injured pancreas, or as chronic damage with persistent pain or malabsorption. It is a disease process characterized by irreversible damage to the pancreas as distinct from reversible changes in acute pancreatitis. Tobacco smoke and alcohol misuse are two of the most frequently implicated causes, and the two risk factors are thought to have a synergistic effect with regards to the development of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Upper abdominal pain: Upper abdominal pain which increases after drinking or eating, lessens when fasting or sitting and leaning forward. Some people may not suffer pain.
* Nausea and vomiting
* Steatorrhea: Frequent, oily, foul-smelling bowel movements. Damage to the pancreas can reduce the production of pancreatic enzymes that aid digestion, causing Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency. Fats and nutrients are not absorbed properly, leading to loose, greasy stool known as steatorrhea. It can also lead to malnutrition. 
* Weight loss even when eating habits and amounts are normal.
* Type 3c diabetes (pancreatogenic diabetes): Chronic pancreatitis can affect the ability of the pancreatic islets to produce insulin to regulate glucose levels, leading to diabetes type 3c. Symptoms of diabetes type 3c are due to elevated sugar and may include increased hunger and thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, fatigue, and blurry vision.
* Osteopathy: Chronic pancreatitis is associated with an increased risk of osteopathy, including osteoporosis and osteopenia. Malnutrition, inflammation, and lifestyle factors contribute to the high prevalence of bone disorders in chronic pancreatitis patients.

There have been three pain symptom profiles described in those with chronic pancreatitis. Type A involves intermittent, severe symptom flare-ups with or without objective pancreatitis separated by pain-free periods. The type A symptom profile is usually more common early in the course of chronic pancreatitis. Type B chronic pancreatitis involves chronic pain accompanied by intermittent severe attacks. And, the type C symptom profile of chronic pancreatitis involves chronic, long-term, severe pain without interspersed acute flare-ups or symptom exacerbations.

==Causes==
Among the causes of chronic pancreatitis are the following:
Chronic alcohol misuse and smoking are well-established risk factors for the development of chronic pancreatitis, and the two are thought to have a synergistic effect with regard to disease development. Alcohol use is present in 42–77% of those who have chronic pancreatitis, and tobacco use is present in greater than 60% of those with chronic pancreatitis. Genetic mutations are thought to be responsible for 10% of cases. This includes mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1), and the chymotrypsin C (CTRC) proteins. 28% of cases of chronic pancreatitis are idiopathic (of an unknown cause). In a small group of patients, chronic pancreatitis has been shown to be hereditary. Hereditary pancreatitis, which causes 1% of chronic pancreatitis, involves a mutation of the Trypsin 1 gene that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Almost all patients with cystic fibrosis have established chronic pancreatitis, usually from birth. Cystic fibrosis gene mutations have also been identified in patients with chronic pancreatitis but in whom there were no other manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Obstruction of the pancreatic duct because of either a benign or malignant process may result in chronic pancreatitis.

==Pathophysiology==

The mechanism of chronic pancreatitis viewed from a genetic standpoint indicates early onset of severe epigastric pain beginning in childhood. It is an autosomal dominant disease; chronic pancreatitis disease is identified in the cationic trypsinogen gene PRSS1, and mutation, R122H. R122H is the most common mutation for hereditary chronic pancreatitis with replacement of arginine with histidine at amino acid position 122 of the trypsinogen protein. There are, of course, other mechanisms – alcohol, malnutrition, smoking – each exhibiting its own effect on the pancreas.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is made based on the history and characteristics of symptoms combined with findings on radiologic imaging. Serum amylase and lipase may be moderately elevated in cases of chronic pancreatitis.

Symptoms of diarrhea, with oily, bulky, and foul-smelling stools indicated steatorrhea or fat malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can be confirmed by also checking a fecal elastase level, with low levels specifying exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. A quantitative fecal fat test can also be done to quantify the fat levels in the stool and confirm the presence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

When chronic pancreatitis is caused by genetic factors, elevations in ESR, IgG4, rheumatoid factor, ANA and anti-smooth muscle antibody may be detected.

Computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) all have similar sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. MRCP is particularly utilized for its sensitivity in imaging the pancreatic ducts and bile ducts for associated changes such as stones or strictures.
A biopsy of the pancreas is not required for the diagnosis. On imaging, pancreatic and bile duct dilatation, atrophy of the pancreas, multiple calcifications of the pancreas, and enlargement of pancreatic glands can be found.

On MRI scan, there is a low T1 signal due to inflammation, fibrosis, focal lesions, and calcifications. In those who are given a contrast agent, there would be a higher T1 signal with late gadolinium enhancement due to compression from the fibrotic areas. The overall thickness of the pancreas will be reduced.

==Treatment==
The different treatment options for the management of chronic pancreatitis are medical measures, therapeutic endoscopy, and surgery. Treatment is directed, when possible, to the underlying cause, and to relieve pain and malabsorption. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus may occur and need long-term insulin therapy. The abdominal pain can be very severe and require high doses of analgesics, sometimes including opiates. Medications such as pregabalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used to treat pain in chronic pancreatitis. Alcohol cessation is important to manage pain and slow the calcific process, possibly reducing the future risk of flare-ups. Antioxidants may help, but it is unclear if the benefits are meaningful.

Endoscopic treatments, including removal of stones in the pancreatic duct, and dilation of strictures may be done. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy can also be done, in which external acoustic waves are administered to break the stones. This may be combined with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to collect larger stones.

Behavioral treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy including resilience training, stress management, chronic pain rehabilitation programs and addiction treatment may also be used as adjunct treatments.

===Pancreatic enzymes===
Pancreatic enzyme replacement is often effective in treating the malabsorption and steatorrhea associated with chronic pancreatitis. Treatment of CP consists of the administration of a solution of pancreatic enzymes with meals. Some patients do have pain reduction with enzyme replacement, and since they are relatively safe, giving enzyme replacement to a chronic pancreatitis patient is an acceptable step in treatment for most patients. Treatment may be more likely to be successful in those without the involvement of large ducts and those with idiopathic pancreatitis.

===Surgery===
Surgery to treat chronic pancreatitis tends to be divided into two areas – resectional and drainage procedures. Among the reasons to opt for surgery is if there is a pseudocyst, fistula, ascites, or a fixed obstruction. The Puestow procedure (anastomosis of the pancreatic duct to the jejunum to allow drainage of the obstructed duct), pancreaticoduodenectomy (partial pancreatic resection), or total pancreatectomy with or without autologous islet cell transplantation (removal of the whole pancreas, which is usually reserved for cases refractory to other surgical and medical interventions) may be used for treatment of chronic pancreatitis.

== Epidemiology ==
The annual incidence of chronic pancreatitis is 5 to 12 per 100,000 persons. The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis in the U.S. is 90-100 per 100,000 adults. Chronic pancreatitis affects people in countries around the world.

On March 12, 2013, President Waheed ratified a new &#x27;Political Party Bill&#x27;, replacing the guidelines established in 2005, when a multi-party system was created in the country. The bill saw the raising of the minimum number of members required to register a political party from 3000 to 10,000. With the ratification of the bill, all political parties which did not have 10,000 members registered were dissolved.

The following is a list of parties dissolved under the new law:

<text>Juan Antonio Samaranch Salisachs (born 1 November 1959) is a Spanish sports executive and financial analyst who currently serves as the vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). He is the son of former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.

==Early life==
Samaranch was born on 1 November 1959 in Barcelona, Spain, the only son of María Teresa Salisachs and Juan Antonio Samaranch. He has one sister, María Teresa. His father was Minister of Sports under Franco from 1967 to 1971 and president of the IOC from 1980 to 2001. The family spent some time living in Moscow, Soviet Union while Samaranch the elder served as a diplomat following the restoration of democracy in Spain.

Samaranch attended University of Barcelona, where he studied industrial engineering, and earned his MBA from New York University (NYU) in 1986. He previously served as the regional leader for NYU&#x27;s Stern School of Business alumni group in Spain.

==Career==
Before earning his MBA, Samaranch worked as a perfume salesman for International Flavors &amp; Fragrances for two and a half years. After graduating from NYU in 1986, he worked for three years as an associate at First Boston Corporation in New York, then served as a partner and as the vice president of corporate finance for S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. in London. In 1991, he co-founded GBS Finanzas. In 1996, he became vice president of the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) and in 2001, the same year his father retired, was elected as a member of the IOC. He served on the Organizing Committees for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In 2015, Samaranch was appointed president of the Summit Shopping, Tourism and Economy committee, which focused on increasing the &quot;number of quality visitors and tourists in Spain and Madrid.&quot; He was elected vice president of the IOC in 2016, where he served on the Oswald Commission, which made decisions about Russian athletes following the Summer Olympics doping scandal. He finished his four year term as VP of IOC in 2020. 

Samaranch established the Samaranch Foundation in Beijing, China in 2012 in honor of his late father. The organization &quot;aims to promote sport in China&quot; and encourages good relations between China and Spain. Initial funding came from the Samaranch family, IOC, Chinese Olympic Committee, Beijing Olympic City Development Association, Spanish government, Barcelona&#x27;s government, Anta Sports, Samsung China, Tibet Spring, China Post, Beijing Tourism Group, Taishan Sports, and La Caixa.

In February 2013, the IOC voted to eliminate one sport from the Olympics. Although many experts predicted that the pentathlon would be removed due to its low popularity. Despite having a larger athlete and fan base, wrestling due the doping cases was removed instead. This rule was about to start at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Samaranch was largely regarded as a major player in the decision, in part because of his conflict of interest with the UIPM, which would be damaged with the elimination of the pentathlon. By September, wrestling had been reinstated on grounds of its long history at the Olympics.

In 2019, Samaranch received an honorary doctorate from Handong Global University in South Korea. As of 2022, Samaranch had been reelected as the IOC vice president, was on the IOC&#x27;s Board of Directors, was a member of the Spanish Olympic Committee, and was chairman of the Organizing Committee for Beijing 2022.

In 2020, Samaranch was firm in his belief that the Olympics should continue regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit with necessary restrictions and precautions, even if the vaccine did not become available before the event. Historically, Samaranch has supported the candidacy of Madrid as the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics as well as Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics despite experts&#x27; assertions that it would be the &quot;most unsustainable games of all time&quot; due to the amount of artificial snow needed. He was also a major proponent of holding the 2030 Winter Olympics in Barcelona-Pyrenees but the bid was officially pulled in June 2022 due to a lack of agreement between the governments of Aragon and Catalonia.

In September 2024, he was announced as one of seven candidates in the running to succeed Thomas Bach as IOC president.

==Personal life==
Samaranch is married to Italian socialite Cristina Bigelli and together they have four children: Juan, Alessia, Matteo, and Allegra. Alessia is married to French financier Hadrien Forterre. Samaranch speaks Spanish, Catalan, Italian, French, and English. He and his family live in Madrid.

<text>The United States Navy reclassified many of its surface vessels in 1975, changing terminology and hull classification symbols for cruisers, frigates, and ocean escorts.

== Classification prior to 1975 ==
From the 1950s to 1975, the US Navy had three types of fast task force escorts and one type of convoy escort. The task force escorts were cruisers (hull classification symbols CAG/CLG/CG), frigates or destroyer-leaders (DL/DLG), and destroyers (DD/DDG); the convoy escorts were ocean escorts (DE/DEG), often called destroyer escorts as they retained the designation and number series of the World War II vessels. Added in the early 1970s was a new ocean escort called the patrol frigate (PF), another designation previously used in World War II, which was the initial designation of the . In 1975, these classifications were simplified to cruiser (CG), destroyer (DD/DDG), and frigate (FF/FFG).

Under the pre-1975 classification, cruisers were large vessels, the size of World War II gun cruisers, intended as the primary surface combatants. All but one () were converted World War II gun cruisers (CL/CLG or CA/CAG), carrying either Talos or Terrier surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and in some cases also Tartar missiles. The primary mission of these ships and the guided missile frigates was to intercept Soviet anti-ship cruise missiles. One cruiser was to be assigned to each carrier group. Most of the cruiser conversions were performed to rapidly deploy the new naval SAMs while the guided missile frigates were being designed and built. There were relatively few cruiser conversions, due to their cost and because the frigates could carry almost as many weapons as a cruiser.

From 1950 to 1975, frigates were a new type, midway between cruiser and destroyer sizes, intended as major task force escorts. The first ship of the type was a redesignated ASW cruiser; the next four were very large AAW (gun) destroyers (DL), and the remainder were essentially oversize guided missile destroyers classified as DLGs. They carried the mid-range Terrier missile, but no offensive (strategic) weapons.

Destroyers were developed from the World War II designs as the smallest fast task force escorts. DDs were fast ASW ships; DDGs were AAW ships carrying the short-range Tartar missile.

Ocean escorts were an evolution of the World War II destroyer escort types. They were intended as convoy escorts and were designed for mobilization production in wartime or low-cost mass production in peacetime. DEs were ASW vessels; DEGs were AAW vessels with Tartar missiles.

The U.S. frigate classification was not used by any other navy; similar vessels were either cruisers or destroyers in foreign service. The ocean escort type corresponded to foreign frigates (convoy escorts).

== The &quot;cruiser gap&quot; ==

The Soviets defined &quot;guided missile cruisers&quot; as large warships armed with long range anti-ship missiles. The term &quot;cruiser&quot; included also two large helicopter carriers (&quot;Moskva&quot; class). The ships equivalent to U.S. frigates were classified as &quot;large anti-submarine ships&quot;, but the larger of them were designated as &quot;cruisers&quot; by Western navies. This led to a conclusion, that by 1974, there were only six ships in U.S. service classified as cruisers, but the Soviets had 19 cruisers in service with seven more being built. (All totals exclude gun-only cruisers). All but two of the Soviet ships were relatively small vessels, roughly equivalent to U.S. frigates and far smaller than U.S. cruisers. However, most included a heavy anti-ship cruise missile battery that US surface combatants lacked until the introduction of the Harpoon missile circa 1980.

The differing U.S. and Soviet definitions of &quot;cruiser&quot; caused political problems when comparisons were made between U.S. and Soviet naval forces. A table comparing U.S. and Soviet cruiser forces showed six U.S. ships vs. 19 Soviet ships, despite the existence of 21 U.S. &quot;frigates&quot; equal or superior in size to the Soviet &quot;cruisers&quot;. This led to the perception of a non-existent &quot;cruiser gap&quot;.

== Closing the gap ==

To close this &quot;gap,&quot; the U.S. frigate (DL/DLG) classification was eliminated on 30 June 1975. All the gun frigates (DL) had already been stricken or converted to DDGs. Most of the DLGs became cruisers (CG), but the smaller &quot;Farragut&quot;s became destroyers (DDG). All of the nuclear-powered DLGNs, existing or in construction, were redesignated as CGNs. The change from DLG to CG redefined &quot;cruiser&quot; as smaller ships, more like large destroyers. Cruiser classifications were also simplified, with the guided missile light cruisers (CLG) simply becoming CGs. Gun cruisers retained the &quot;CA&quot; designation although the last remaining gun cruiser, &quot;Newport News&quot;, was decommissioned three days earlier on 27 June 1975.

The ocean escorts (DE/DEG) and patrol frigates (PF) became frigates (FF) or guided missile frigates (FFG).

These changes brought U.S. Navy classifications into line with foreign classifications, and eliminated the perceived &quot;cruiser gap.&quot;

A final change came on 1 January 1980, when the guided missile destroyers (DDG) became guided missile cruisers (CG).

<doc id="1035159" wikidata="Q4982271" url="?curid=1035159" title="Bubblicious">
<text>Bubblicious is a brand of bubble gum owned by the Italian-Dutch company Perfetti Van Melle.

Originally produced by the American Chicle Division of Warner-Lambert, the brand was launched in 1977 in response to the tremendous sales of Bubble Yum, the first soft bubble gum. The brand struggled upon introduction, but sales took off with the advent, in 1978, of the &quot;Ultimate Bubble&quot; advertising campaign. Bubblicious was later expanded internationally.

==Flavors==
There have been 28 flavors of Bubblicious, all except watermelon have been discontinued. Flavors have included Cotton Candy, Paradise Punch, Sour Cherry, and Choco Choco Chip. Bubblicious is available in original format and Bubblicious Bursts with a liquid-filled center.

The original &quot;Lightning Lemonade&quot; flavor was discontinued in the year 2000. However, in 2005 the flavor was re-introduced as &quot;LeBron&#x27;s Lightning Lemonade&quot;, based on a partnership between Bubblicious and basketball player LeBron James. The caricature featured on the packaging was illustrated by cartoonist Grey Blackwell. When the flavor was re-introduced, it was changed to include a raspberry flavor element.

&quot;Bubblicious Ink&#x27;d!&quot; was a somewhat sour flavor the coloring of which caused the chewer&#x27;s tongue to turn blue. The flavor was supported by Cartoon Network&#x27;s Klik Street Skaters&#x27; Group, who performed a commercial similar to the company&#x27;s original Ink&#x27;d! commercial.

Bubblicious Sherbet ice cream is made by Breyers with bubble gum pieces and a bubble gum swirl.

==Trivia==
Bubblicious was involved in the Guinness World Records for the most bubble gum bubbles blown at one time. Hundreds of Little League players and fans joined Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith to set the world record with over 100 fans and 300 pieces of Bubblicious gum.

In June 2013, former New England Patriots Tight End Aaron Hernandez was linked to a murder by his purchase of Blue Cotton Candy Bubblicious.

<text>Marc Lalonde (; July 26, 1929 – May 6, 2023) was a Canadian politician who served as a cabinet minister, political staffer and lawyer. A lifelong member of the Liberal Party, he is best known for having served in various positions of government from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s, including serving as the Minister of Finance.

==Early life==
Lalonde was born in L&#x27;Île-Perrot, Quebec, and obtained a Master of Laws degree from the , a master&#x27;s degree from Oxford University, and a Diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures en droit (D.E.S.D) from the University of Ottawa.

In 1959, he worked in Ottawa as a special adviser to Progressive Conservative Justice Minister Davie Fulton. He went to Montreal to practise law until 1967 when he returned to Ottawa to work as an adviser in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office under Liberal Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. Lalonde remained when Pierre Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada in 1968, serving as Principal Secretary. In this role during the 1970 October crisis he negotiated with Quebec premier Robert Bourassa and Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau to request the enactment of the War Measures Act in order to show that the enactment had the support of the Quebec and Montreal governments.

==Political career==

At Trudeau&#x27;s urging, he ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1972 election. Elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Outremont, Lalonde immediately joined the Cabinet as Minister of National Health and Welfare, a position he held until 1977. He was concurrently Minister of Amateur Sport until 1976 and was also Minister responsible for the Status of Women from 1974 to 1979.

A staunch federalist, he was also one of Trudeau&#x27;s chief advisers on the situation in Quebec, taking the position of Minister of State on federal-provincial relations in the wake of the Parti Québécois victory in the 1976 Quebec provincial election. Lalonde led a clandestine body within the Canadian Federal Government, codenamed FAN TAN, that collected intelligence on the Quebec separatist movement and organized political action against the separatists. 

Lalonde served as Minister of Justice from 1978 until the Liberal government&#x27;s defeat in the 1979 election. When the Liberals returned to power in the 1980 election, Lalonde became Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and instituted the National Energy Program which became intensely unpopular in Alberta. The Bank of Canada reported that economic problems had been accelerated and magnified. Inflation was most commonly between 9% and 10% annually, 

Lalonde was appointed minister of finance in 1982. As finance minister, he tabled the 1983 and 1984 federal budgets; both budgets saw a substantial increase in the government budget deficit, as the deficit increased from $29.049 billion in 1982 to $37.167 billion in 1984.

When Trudeau resigned, Lalonde endorsed John Turner in the 1984 Liberal leadership convention and continued as finance minister after Turner succeeded Trudeau as prime minister in 1984, but did not run in the 1984 election which saw the Liberals suffer a landslide loss to the Progressive Conservatives.

==After politics==

In 1989, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2004, he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

In the 1990s, he served as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge at the International Court of Justice, and has also represented Canada in various trade disputes. He was a practising lawyer with the firm of Stikeman Elliott LLP in Montreal until his retirement in 2006.

Lalonde returned to the political arena in 2005 when Prime Minister Paul Martin named him co-president of the Liberal Party&#x27;s electoral campaign in Quebec for the 39th Canadian federal election. Brigitte Legault, the president of the Young Liberals of Canada (Quebec), served as the other co-president.

Lalonde appeared before the House of Commons of Canada&#x27;s Ethics Committee in November 2008 along with client Karlheinz Schreiber, who was being questioned in regard to the Airbus affair involving former PM Brian Mulroney.

Lalonde died on May 6, 2023, at age 93.

<text>The VEF I-16 was a prototype Latvian fighter aircraft designed by Kārlis Irbītis and produced by VEF in 1939. Development was halted by the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 and the subsequent purge of VEF personnel.

== Description ==
The I-16 was of conventional monoplane layout with a Walter Sagitta supercharged air-cooled V12 engine of Czechoslovak origin, a two-bladed propeller and a low-set wing with rounded wingtips. The prototype had fixed undercarriage with aerodynamic fairings, but production models were to have retractable landing gear. The cockpit seat and controls were designed as one unit - they could be assembled totally separately from the rest of the aircraft and then installed as a unit with only six bolts.

While the prototype was unarmed, there were provisions for two machine guns in the fuselage, along with the ability to carry one additional gun under each wing.

==Operational history==
In the spring of 1940 Latvian Air Force pilots made the first test flights of the VEF I-16 prototype. After the occupation of Latvia in June 1940, the Soviet authorities ordered that all VEF aircraft be removed from Spilve Airport and, a few weeks later, all parts fabrication and assembly work was ordered suspended pending further instructions from Moscow. In March 1941, the I-16&#x27;s designer Kārlis Irbītis received orders to prepare one example each of the VEF I-12, VEF I-15a and I-15b, I-16, VEF I-17 (two variants) and VEF I-18 to be shipped to Moscow for evaluation. The I-16 still had engine problems and needed further testing, so was left behind and stayed in Riga. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the I-16 managed to make several test flights from an aerodrome in Kalnciems but soon the single example was captured by German forces and tested by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The VEF I-16 was used as training aircraft at an aviation school in Torun until 1942.

<text>Sultan Turki bin Said bin Sultan Al Busaidi (; 1832 – 4 June 1888), was Sultan of Muscat and Oman from 30 January 1871 to 4 June 1888. He acceded following his victory over his cousin, Iman Azzan bin Qais at the Battle of Dhank. On Turki&#x27;s death, he was succeeded by his second son, Faisal bin Turki.

==Early life==
Turki was born in 1832 to Sultan Said bin Sultan and an Ethiopian concubine. His father appointed him the Wali of Sohar in 1854.

In 1861, he revolted against his brother, Thuwaini bin Said, who had succeeded his father as Sultan of Oman. The division of Muscat and Zanzibar meant that Sohar would be under the authority of Thuwaini which Turki refused to accept. He was imprisoned and Salim bin Thuwaini was appointed as the new Wali of Sohar. The British authorities intervened and Thuwaini was released from prison in 1862. After Salim killed his father and took the throne in 1866, Turki was again imprisoned and subsequently released due to British intervention. He was given an annuity of 7,200 thalers and moved to Bombay in British India.

==Issue==
Turki bin Said had five children.
* Sayyid Muhammad bin Turki (1860–?); had issue
* Sayyid Faisal bin Turki (1864–1913); married Sayyida Aliyah bint Thuwaini bin Said and had issue

<text>Hadschi Halef Omar Ben Hadschi Abul Abbas Ibn Hadschi Dawud al Gossarah, literally &quot;hajji&quot; Halef Omar, son of &quot;hajji&quot; father-of-Abbas, son of &quot;hajji&quot; David al Gossarah, is one of Karl May&#x27;s literary characters. &quot;Hajji&quot; means &quot;one who has performed the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca&quot;.

Halef is the exceedingly loyal servant, companion and friend of German adventurer Kara Ben Nemsi. Halef accompanies Kara Ben Nemsi through all his adventures in the Middle East from &quot;Durch die Wüste&quot; to &quot;Der Schut&quot;. He is a very devout Muslim, and throughout the adventures with Kara Ben Nemsi he tries to convince him of the superiority of Islam.

After many adventures he became &quot;Scheik of the Haddedihn of the great tribe of the Schammar&quot;. He is married to &quot;Hanneh&quot;, the &quot;most beautiful wife on earth&quot;, and with her has a son called &quot;Kara Ben Halef&quot;, who in later novels also has some adventures.

The German disco group Dschinghis Khan also released a song entitled &quot;Hadschi Halef Omar&quot; on their 1980 album &quot;Rom.&quot; The entire chorus is basically reciting Halef&#x27;s name.

<text>Rockstar (stylized as ROCKST★R or ЯR) is a brand of energy drinks created in 2001, which had a 10% market share of the global energy drink market in 2020, the third-highest after Red Bull and Monster Energy. Rockstar is based in Purchase, New York. , Rockstar Energy Drink is available in more than 20 flavors and in more than 30 countries.
Since March 2020 Rockstar is a part of PepsiCo.

== History ==

Founded in 2001 by Russ Weiner, the son of right-wing radio show host Michael Savage.
Rockstar launched into what was the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. beverage market at the time, energy drinks.
In addition to featuring different ingredients, which it claimed were &quot;scientifically formulated to speed the recovery time of those who lead active and exhausting lifestyles—from athletes to rock stars,&quot;
Rockstar sought to differentiate itself from the market leader, Red Bull, by using a can size as opposed to Red Bull&#x27;s can, and drawing attention to this fact with the slogan &quot;twice the size of Red Bull for the same price&quot;.

By 2007, Rockstar was one of the top three energy drink brands in North America, with a 155% growth in sales in 2004, reaching $48 million,
and had sold over a billion cans. It had 14% of the US energy drink market in 2008, and as of 2009 was available in over 20 countries. Among those countries are Sold: in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Mexico, Malta, New Zealand, Argentina, the Netherlands, Finland, South Africa, Morocco and Colombia. Rockstar switched distributors from the Coca-Cola Company to PepsiCo in the summer of 2009.

Production and distribution for the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland was franchised to Irn Bru owners A.G. Barr, This contract was terminated in 2020, following the acquisition by PepsiCo.

In 2020, PepsiCo acquired Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion.

In 2021, the company altered the flavor of the &quot;Original&quot; version and can styling underwent a re-design as part of a new marketing campaign.

== Contents ==

Original Rockstar Energy Drink includes sugar, caffeine, and a variety of herbs, like panax ginseng, ginkgo biloba, milk thistle extract, and guarana-seed extract. The amount of guarana used to be higher, but &quot;after being criticized for including guarana once health concerns about the herb were publicized, the amount in the drink was significantly reduced&quot;.
It also includes 1000 mg of taurine.

Rockstar products in the US have two levels of caffeine content: either 10 mg of caffeine per ounce, or 15 mg of caffeine per ounce. Rockstar Energy Drink Original contains 160 mg of caffeine per 16 ounce can, while the Rockstar Punched and Pure Zero energy drinks contain 240 mg of caffeine per 16 ounce can.

Several alcoholic versions of Rockstar are available in Canada; an alcoholic version in the US was discontinued in 2007, possibly in response to criticism that young people were confusing the alcoholic version with the regular one.

== Criticism ==

=== Health issues ===
Rockstar Original was named Worst Energy Drink by &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine for having 280 calories due to 67.5 grams of sugar. Monster Energy Lo-Carb, with 20 calories, was suggested as a replacement.
Rockstar has responded to this kind of criticism by introducing a line of low calorie energy drinks that include electrolytes called &quot;Rockstar Recovery&quot;.

In general, energy drinks can cause jitteriness and anxiety. If mixed with alcohol, they may also mask the level of alcohol intoxication. Used in moderation, no detrimental side effects have been known.

=== Corporate governance ===
Members of the LGBT community have spoken out against Rockstar because the company&#x27;s founder and chief executive officer is the son of right-wing radio personality Michael Savage and because its former chief financial officer, Janet Weiner, is Savage&#x27;s wife and CFO of his production company. The boycott was motivated by allegations that Savage had made homophobic, racist, antisemitic, and discriminatory comments. In May 2009, then San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom returned a $25,000 donation which Rockstar had made to his 2010 re-election campaign.

During an interview with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Newsom aide Eric Jaye stated the money was returned because &quot;there was some statements made during (Weiner&#x27;s) 1998 campaign in the GOP primary which conflicted with the mayor&#x27;s position and we&#x27;re returning the check,&quot; he said.

In a later interview Weiner told &quot;SF Gate&quot;: &quot;I still wish Gavin well. I always will.&quot; But he said that with the donation rejected, &quot;I&#x27;m taking this money and I&#x27;m donating it to charity. We&#x27;re telling them to name a charity of their choosing, and if they don&#x27;t want it, we&#x27;ll donate it to Project Open Hand.&quot;

Janet Weiner stepped down from her role as CFO of Savage Productions &quot;as an apparent statement of solidarity with equality advocates&quot; which had not been requested as part of the agreement.

=== Website dispute ===
Rockstar, saying that the &quot;truthaboutrockstarenergydrink.com&quot; domain name was registered and used in bad faith, obtained control of that site under a decision from the National Arbitration Forum.

== Sponsorship ==
Like its competitors Red Bull and Monster Energy, Rockstar sponsors a range of action sports and music events, including the Mayhem Festival, a metal and rock festival touring the United States in July and August, the Uproar Festival, a rock festival touring the United States in September and October, and the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series. Both the Mayhem and Uproar events were discontinued in 2015.

Rockstar also sponsors a large number of action sports competitors, such as the Husqvarna factory motorcycle riders Gautier Paulin, Graham Jarvis and Pablo Quintanilla, motorcycle road racer Jorge Lorenzo (2011–2012), flat track rider Bryan Smith, rallycross drivers Tanner Foust and Scott Speed, off-road truck driver Rob MacCachren, and drifters Fredric Aasbø and Ryan Tuerck.

However, later he started to enroll in acting lessons in Salzburg, Vienna and Zurich. Then he found employment in theatres, most notably in Munich, Salzburg, Hamburg and Vienna (Theater in der Josefstadt).

During his later career he starred in several roles in television and motion pictures. In the role of Edmund Sackbauer (Mundl) in the 1970s, he became famous as the typical Viennese (&quot;Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter&quot;). Another big success came with the films &quot;Bockerer&quot; starring as a naive Viennese during the Second World War in Vienna (the later films are set in the subsequent years to 1945).

From 1999, Merkatz was chairman of the human rights group &quot;SOS Mitmensch&quot;.

<text>William Douglas Porter (September 9, 1932 – December 3, 2013) was an American salesman, who worked for Watkins Incorporated based in Winona, Minnesota. Born with cerebral palsy, Porter&#x27;s background and work was brought to the public&#x27;s attention in 1995 when an Oregon-based newspaper published a series of feature stories about him.

==Life==
Porter was born in San Francisco, California, and at a young age moved to Portland, Oregon along with his mother. He was unable to gain employment due to his cerebral palsy, but refused to go on disability. Porter eventually convinced Watkins Incorporated to give him a door-to-door salesman job, selling its products on a seven-mile route in the Portland area. He eventually became Watkins&#x27; top seller, and worked for the company for over forty years.

In 1995, the newspaper &quot;The Oregonian&quot; ran a feature story about Porter. The story of his optimistic determination made him the subject of media attention across the United States. He was featured in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and on ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20.&quot; The &quot;20/20&quot; broadcast received over 2000 phone calls and letters, which was the most ever for a &quot;20/20&quot; story. Porter was the subject of a 2002 made-for-TV movie on TNT called &quot;Door to Door&quot;, featuring William H. Macy, Kyra Sedgwick and Helen Mirren. In 2009 the Japanese TBS network aired a TV movie loosely based on Bill Porter, also called &quot;Door to Door&quot;. It starred Ninomiya Kazunari and Rosa Kato as fictional versions of Porter and Brady. Porter died of an infection in Gresham, Oregon, on December 3, 2013, at the age of 81.

<doc id="1035225" wikidata="Q1076324" url="?curid=1035225" title="Latvian Air Force">
<text>Latvian Air Force () is the aviation branch of the National Armed Forces. The first air force (AF) units were established in 1919 and re-established in 1992. It has no air combat capability, thus the defense of Latvian air space is maintained by NATO, with rotating detachments of four aircraft to Lithuania at four-monthly intervals (see Baltic Air Policing).

== History ==


=== 1919–1940 ===
The Latvian Air Force was first founded during the Latvian War of Independence. On 7 June 1919 an Air Group was formed, commanded by Lt. . The first aircraft were former Bolshevik Nieuport 24bis and Sopwith 1½ Strutter, both seized from German forces. They first flew on 5 August 1919, and accomplished the first bombing mission on 26 August 1919. From September the air force had three aircraft, and took part in fighting against the Germans and White Russians. Another 7–8 aircraft were seized and repaired after defeating of Russo-German forces, and 7 Sopwith Camels and 3 Sopwith 1½ Strutters were received from the British in December 1919. The Latvian air force flew 69 missions during the war of independence. In the years to follow many more aircraft were added to the inventory and the Air Group was eventually renamed the Aviation Regiment in 1926. An interesting feat of the Latvian naval aviation was a 6000-km trip to England and back, by three Fairey Seal floatplanes, in 1936.

In 1939, the Aviation Regiment consisted of three fighter squadrons, armed with 24 Gloster Gladiator and 6 Bristol Bulldog (a fourth squadron was in organization), three reconnaissance squadrons, armed with up to 12 Letov Š-16LS, 2 Hawker Hind and 10 Stampe SV.5, and a naval reconnaissance squadron with 4 Fairey Seal and two other planes. In 1939, Latvia ordered and paid for 30 British Hawker Hurricane fighters, but due to the country being overrun, they were never delivered. By 1940, there were almost 130 aircraft in service. 

A separate, mostly light aircraft Aviation Regiment of the Aizsargi organization also existed parallel to the air force until the Soviet occupation. In addition to biplanes, it also purchased planes locally produced by the VEF factory, e.g. at least four I-12 trainers in 1938.

The roundel of the air force since 1919 was a maroon-red &quot;ugunskrusts&quot;, with the Aizsargi Aviation Regiment adopting an &quot;auseklis&quot; symbol as their insignia (which was replicated by the National Guard airmen later in the 1990s).

In 1940, the Aviation Regiment and the Latvian Armed Forces were dissolved after the Soviet occupation of Latvia and some aircraft and personnel were pressed into service of the Soviet Air Force.

=== Since 1992 ===
The post-Soviet Latvian Air Force was formed on 24 February 1992 at Spilve Airport. In August 1994 the air force moved to the ex-Soviet Lielvārde Air Base. As the withdrawing Soviet Air Force did not leave any aircraft in Latvia, the first aircraft operated by the air force were four Polish PZL Mi-2U helicopters that were received from civilian aviation in 1992. These were supplemented with two Let L-410UVP utility planes donated by Germany in 1993, however, one was lost in a 1995 accident in Lielvārde. Six PZL-104 Wilga-35A trainer aircraft from ex-DOSAAF stocks were mostly used by the Aviation Component of the Latvian National Guard since 1993. Similarly, the Component acquired around 20 LET L-13 Blaník, three SZD-48-3 Jantar Standard 3 and three LAK-12 gliders.

In the beginning of the 21st century two new and heavier Mi-8MTV Hip helicopters were bought. Both helicopters are fitted with search and rescue equipment, but are also used for transportation of troops, evacuation and support of the Special Forces. In 2000, the Aviation Component of the National Guard was merged into the air force.

In 2004 the Ministry of Defense bought two more Mi-8MTVs at the Russian Ulan Ude helicopter (rework) factory. These two might replace the first two, because of the limited flying time left on the first two examples. One Mi-8MTV is normally at SAR stand-by in Riga, which is closer to the sea than Lielvārde.
In 2004, the air force commenced the modernization of the surface air defense capabilities by signing a contract regarding procurement of RBS-70 missiles.

In 2005, soldiers of the Air Force Air Defense Wing started the respective training course. One Air Defense Battery was to be supplied with the armament; and the personnel training of the Air Defense Wing was completed by the end of 2007.

It was planned to accommodate all the air force units at the Lielvārde military base in the near future. AF Air Operations Center was opened in 2009. Renovation of the air base was finished by 2014.

In July 2018, it was reported that the Ministry of Defence was planning to buy four helicopters for search and rescue, evacuation, and firefighting operations. On August 3, 2018, the US State Department issued a news release, stating that it had approved a possible Foreign Military Sale of four UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters to Latvia. On September 11, 2018, an intergovernmental agreement with the United States for the acquisition of the four UH-60M helicopters was concluded by the Cabinet of Ministers. The first deliveries would take place at the end of 2022.

In May 2020, Ministry of Defence announced plans to renovate three of four An-2. One aircraft is already in use, which was completely refurbished in 2016. The second refurbished An-2 was received in August 2020 and the third in December 2021, with plans to modernize the fourth An-2 within two years. In September 2021, the air force signed a contract for the purchase of two locally made ultralight Pelegrin Tarragons with delivery planned in 2022 and 2023.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Latvia has donated to Ukraine 2 Mil Mi-8MTV-1 transport helicopters, 2 Mil Mi-2 transport helicopters and 2 Mi-17 helicopters.

Freed up funds have allowed the Ministry of Defence to purchase four MD 530F Cayuse Warrior light helicopters; delivery date is planned to be between 2026 and 2027.

== Mission ==

The air force carries out Latvian airspace surveillance, control and defense, provides air defense support to the Land Forces units and participates in search and rescue operations over the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Riga and dry land. They also transport NAF soldiers and cargo, provide transport for the State President, as well as other high-level Latvian and foreign officials during their visits to Latvia and abroad. AF aircraft also assist other NAF units, the Interior Ministry and the Crisis Medicine Centre. The air force carries out the national airspace surveillance by military radars included in its armament.

One of the key priorities for the development of the AF is their integration into the NATO Air Defense System. The modernization of air defense equipment and the training of personnel is carried out with this purpose in mind. Enhancing the Air Space Surveillance System, developing a search and rescue helicopter subdivision and personnel training are also included on this list of priorities.
air force helicopters in co-operation with the Disaster Medicine Center also transport patients in grave condition, persons injured in accidents and persons injured in traffic accidents from rural regions to Riga hospitals.

Development of the Lielvārde military base will ensure centralization of air force units and establishment of an efficient command and control system, which will result in a reduction of the maintenance costs of the air force units.

The main mission of air force is to:
*Provide for the control and defense of the national air space; 
*Provide combat and mobilization readiness for units; 
*Participate in people and object search and rescue operations; 
*Perform air transportation duties and air defense.

<text>The Fourth Army was a field army that formed part of the British Expeditionary Force during the First World War. The Fourth Army was formed on 5 February 1916 under the command of General Sir Henry Rawlinson to carry out the main British contribution to the Battle of the Somme.

==First World War==

===History===
The Fourth Army was formed in France on 5 February 1916, under the command of Sir Henry Rawlinson. It was created in preparation for the Battle of the Somme after the French Tenth Army was transferred to the Battle of Verdun. On the first day on the Somme, eleven Fourth Army divisions (from XIII Corps, XV Corps, III Corps, X Corps and VIII Corps) attacked astride the Albert–Bapaume road. The attack was completely defeated on the northern sector, so subsequent Fourth Army operations concentrated on the southern sector, handing control of the northern sector to the Reserve Army.

The plan for the Fourth Army during the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July – 10 November 1917), was to mount Operation Hush, an amphibious invasion of the Belgian coast. Once the Germans had been pushed back from the Passchendaele–Westroosebeke ridge and an advance begun on Roeselare and Torhout, the XV Corps would mount the coastal operation. As the Ypres fighting became bogged down, the Fourth Army divisions were drawn off as reinforcements until the army was effectively disbanded.

The Fourth Army was reformed in early 1918—once again under Rawlinson—following the virtual destruction and subsequent disbanding of the Fifth Army during the German offensive known as Operation Michael.

The Fourth Army spearheaded the British Hundred Days offensive that began with the Battle of Amiens and ended with the Armistice in November, 1918.

===Order of Battle===

* February–March 1918 General Sir William Birdwood (temporary)
* April 1918–March 1919 General Sir Henry Rawlinson

==Second World War==

In the Second World War, no Fourth Army took the field but as part of the deception plans Operation Cockade and the later Operation Fortitude North, the Germans were encouraged to believe that a Fourth Army had been established with its headquarters in Edinburgh Castle and was preparing to invade Norway. The selection of the inactive Fourth Army was likely very deliberate because of its combat history during the First World War. That diverted and kept German units away from the real invasion zone in Normandy. In the subsequent Operation Fortitude South, the Fourth Army, with different units, was presented as part of the fictitious First United States Army Group (FUSAG) in its threat to the Pas-de-Calais. After Operation Market Garden, the Fourth Army was notionally intended to conduct Operation Trolleybar, an amphibious assault upon the coast of the Netherlands and later along the German coast. It was to involve a landing by the phantom 76th Infantry Division until the deception was ended in January 1945.

<doc id="1035235" wikidata="Q6577591" url="?curid=1035235" title="List of Major League Baseball leaders in home runs by pitchers">
<text>In baseball, a home run (HR) is typically a fair hit that passes over an outfield fence or into the stands at a distance from home plate of 250 feet or more, which entitles the batter to legally touch all bases and score without liability. Atypically, a batter who hits a fair ball and touches each base in succession from 1st to home, without an error being charged to a defensive player, is credited with an inside-the-park home run. If, during a play, defensive or fan interference is called, and the awarded bases allow the batter to cross home plate, the batter is credited with a home run.

Wes Ferrell holds the all-time Major League Baseball record for home runs hit while playing the position of pitcher. He hit 37 as a pitcher. Baseball Hall of Famers Bob Lemon and Warren Spahn are tied for second with 35 career home runs apiece. Red Ruffing, Earl Wilson, and Don Drysdale are the only other pitchers to hit at least 25 home runs. Jack Stivetts hit a total of 35 home runs in his playing career, 21 as a pitcher. Ferrell and Ruffing also rank among the top pitchers in batting average, hitting .280 and .269, respectively.

As of the 2023 season, Shohei Ohtani, holds the lead among all active pitchers. Madison Bumgarner, with 19 home runs, holds the lead among all active pitchers that exclusively do so. Bumgarner also has hit the second most home runs by a pitcher since the American League adopted the designated hitter rule in 1973 (behind Carlos Zambrano). Bumgarner has played most of his career thus far for the San Francisco Giants of the National League, and is currently playing for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Starting with the 2022 season, the National League also adopted the designated hitter rule, so most pitchers will no longer bat, except two-way players, such as Shohei Ohtani.

Ferrell, who had a career slash line of .280/.351/.446, had his best offensive year in 1931, when he set the single-season record for home runs by a pitcher with nine. The record had previously been held by Stivetts, who had hit seven in 1890. Since 1931, six different pitchers have hit seven home runs in a season: Ferrell, Lemon, Don Newcombe, Don Drysdale (twice), Wilson, and Mike Hampton.

Babe Ruth started his major league career as a pitcher before moving to the outfield. Only 14 of his 714 career home runs were hit as a pitcher, however.

The first pitcher to officially hit a home run was Jack Manning, who accomplished the feat on August 3, 1876. The most home runs by a pitcher in a single game is three, achieved by Jim Tobin on May 13, 1942.

<doc id="1035241" wikidata="Q5195350" url="?curid=1035241" title="Curt Boettcher">
<text>Curtis Roy Boettcher (January 7, 1944 – June 14, 1987), sometimes credited as Curt Boetcher or Curt Becher, was an American singer, songwriter, arranger, musician, and record producer from Wisconsin. He was a pivotal figure in what is now termed &quot;sunshine pop&quot;, working with the Association, the Millennium, Sagittarius, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Tommy Roe, Bobby Jameson, Elton John, Gene Clark, Emitt Rhodes, Tandyn Almer, the Beach Boys, and others.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of Boettcher: &quot;If his life had gone just a bit differently, [he] might have been another Brian Wilson. ... As it stands, Boettcher — a pop-music producer whose heyday was the late &#x27;60s — now survives in rock history mostly as a liner-note credit. He could have been, but never was. Yet he enjoys a godlike status among a select group of music fans, for whom obscurity is more enticing than fame.&quot;

==Early life==
He was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to Peggie and Arland Boettcher. His father was a Navy pilot in World War II and later worked at the Pentagon.

==The GoldeBriars==
Boettcher entered the University of Minnesota in fall 1962, where in 1963 he formed the folk quartet The GoldeBriars with the Holmberg sisters, Dotti and Sheri, and Ron Neilsson. They relocated to Los Angeles after being signed by Epic Records, for whom they recorded and released two albums in 1964, &quot;The GoldeBriars&quot; and &quot;Straight Ahead!&quot; (A third was reportedly recorded in 1965 but withheld from release.) Under the guidance of recording producer Bob Morgan, the vocals were mixed upfront and enriched by double-tracking to sound like six voices. Prior to recording their third album, the group added drummer Ron Edgar (later of The Music Machine; Edgar also worked with Boettcher in the bands The Ballroom and The Millennium). According to music historian Joseph Lanza, the GoldeBriars&#x27; material tended to follow the standard folk formula of songs such as &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, but &quot;acoustically, their style blended the homespun and the sugarspun.&quot; Boettcher arranged most of the group&#x27;s songs, but he also contributed as a songwriter. Morgan, quoted in Lanza&#x27;s &quot;Vanilla Pop&quot;, said that Boettcher&#x27;s childhood as a navy brat influenced songs like &quot;Haiku&quot; on the album &quot;Straight Ahead!&quot;. Bobb Goldsteinn, an accomplished songwriter (who wrote the 1963 folk-dixie hit &quot;Washington Square&quot; for the Village Stompers), became &quot;Boettcher&#x27;s manager [and] confidant[e]&quot;, as well as lyricist for some GoldeBriars songs. As manager, Goldsteinn inched the band in a more pop-flavored direction. The GoldeBriars performed live in the 1965 film &quot;Once Upon a Coffee House&quot;.

==The Association, The Ballroom, and Tommy Roe==

Following the demise of The GoldeBriars, Boettcher moved into production and songwriting work for others, including Lee Mallory and The Association. In 1966, through his production partnership Our Productions, Boettcher produced the debut album by The Association, &quot;And Then... Along Comes the Association&quot;, released on Valiant Records. The album spawned two Top 10 hits, &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; (which reached #7 in the U.S.) and &quot;Cherish&quot; (which reached #1). In 2012, original Association member Jim Yester said Valiant Records claimed &quot;Cherish&quot; sounded &quot;too old and archaic&quot;, but the song&#x27;s success &quot;just showed we can have archaic and eat it, too.&quot; The album included the song &quot;Message of Our Love&quot;, co-written by Boettcher and Tandyn Almer (who also wrote &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot;).

Boettcher&#x27;s wife Claudia said that Almer wrote &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; as a slow song. Boettcher sped up the tempo and recorded a demo on which he sang the vocal. This demo was presented to The Association, who used it as a guide for their arrangement of the tune. It was the band&#x27;s attempt to replicate and build on Boettcher&#x27;s demo that became the group&#x27;s first hit single (produced by Boettcher). Boettcher and Almer had a dispute over writing credits for the song, Boettcher arguing that his extensive contributions to the arrangement, which formed the basis of the hit version of the song, warranted a co-writer credit. However, the song was ultimately credited solely to Almer.

After the album achieved commercial success, according to a November 1966 story in &quot;Billboard&quot;, the band dropped their manager, Dean Fredericks, who in turn filed a breach of contract suit against the band, claiming they were bound by a seven-year agreement. After filing suit, Fredericks joined Our Productions. &quot;Consequently,&quot; Billboard revealed, &quot;[the] Association will no longer associate with Our Productions, and henceforth will be a&amp;r&#x27;d [sic] by Jerry Yester, brother of Association member Jim Yester.&quot; As a result of this dispute, despite his valuable contributions to the debut album&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, Boettcher was prevented from continuing as the band&#x27;s producer. (He produced several tracks for a later incarnation of the band in the early 1980s.)

In a 1974 interview with &quot;ZigZag Magazine&quot;, Boettcher said that during this period he was under contract to Our Productions and on salary. This arrangement accorded him no royalties, but a tremendous amount of artistic freedom. &quot;I wanted to keep on working, to be there. I think for a while I had more hours [of studio experience] for any producer my age. I used to practically live in the studio. And I used to work until I fell over. It was like an addiction.

In 1966 he formed the group The Ballroom with Sandy Salisbury, Michele O&#x27;Malley, and Jim Bell. The quartet recorded an album&#x27;s worth of material, but other than two songs on a 1967 Warner Bros. 45 rpm single, the sessions remained unreleased until 2001.

In 1966, he produced two hit singles for Tommy Roe, &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; and &quot;Hooray for Hazel&quot;. Production on both was credited to Boettcher&#x27;s Our Productions partner, Steve Clark, but Boettcher subsequently claimed that he himself produced these recordings. The following year, Boettcher produced Roe&#x27;s album &quot;It&#x27;s Now Winter&#x27;s Day&quot; (ABC Records).

==The Millennium and Sagittarius==
Boettcher is said to have met both producer Gary Usher and Beach Boy songwriter Brian Wilson while producing and mixing the first single by Lee Mallory, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It&#x27;s Gonna Be&quot;, issued on Valiant Records in 1966. Usher in later years insisted that Boettcher influenced Brian Wilson during the development of the Beach Boys&#x27; perennial album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966), leading him to &quot;abandon surfing music.&quot; Usher&#x27;s statements are contradicted by session date logs and contemporary publications, wherein band members suggested to news publishers that they were looking beyond the confinements of surf rock as early as November 1964.

Usher bought Boettcher&#x27;s contract and signed him as a staff producer for Columbia Records. In 1967 he enlisted Boettcher to collaborate on a personal project, a studio band called Sagittarius, under whose name he had produced a single, &quot;My World Fell Down&quot;, which became a minor hit. (It was sung by Glen Campbell, who at the time was working as a session musician in Los Angeles, with Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys on backing vocals.) Because of the modest chart success of the single, Columbia requested a full album, only to discover there was no group. Usher and Boettcher became the studio group, and an album was completed and released in 1968 under the title &quot;Present Tense&quot;. (Usher and Boettcher are pictured on the cover.) Some of the songs were adapted from the unreleased Ballroom sessions, while others were re-recorded with new arrangements. The single version of &quot;My World Fell Down&quot; was edited differently on the album, omitting a bridge of musique concrète that was on the 45. A second single, &quot;Hotel Indiscreet&quot;, recorded with Boettcher (and featuring a comedic non sequitur by the Firesign Theater), was released, but it failed to chart. The album was a commercial failure.

Usher&#x27;s celebrity, as well as Boettcher&#x27;s successful productions for The Association and Tommy Roe, convinced Columbia to finance Boettcher&#x27;s own studio project. In 1967 he assembled a group of musicians and songwriters with whom he had previously worked or personally knew (including Sandy Salisbury, Lee Mallory, Joey Stec, and Michael Fennelly), as well as some top Los Angeles session musicians, and started recording an album under the group moniker The Millennium. The album was co-produced by Keith Olsen, who had been a friend of Boettcher since his college days. Their debut—and only—album, &quot;Begin&quot;, was the most expensive album ever recorded for Columbia at that point. Despite the release of several singles, sales were dismal and the project was considered a commercial flop. This was partially attributable to Boettcher&#x27;s reluctance to tour. The group staged a few live performances in Los Angeles, but the difficulty of replicating the album in concert posed a large enough challenge to dissuade Boettcher from sustaining the band. Although the single &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot; became a hit in several regions, there was no group to support it. &quot;5 AM&quot; also charted in the Philippines. The group recorded one final single, &quot;Just About The Same&quot; b/w &quot;Blight&quot;, which was not issued at the time. Despite its commercial failure, the album is critically regarded as one of the finest pop albums from the late 1960s, and has been described at AllMusic as a &quot;bona fide lost classic&quot;. In 2000 an album of demos by The Millennium called &quot;Again&quot; was issued.

Soon after The Millennium broke up, Boettcher&#x27;s friend Gary Usher, fired by Columbia Records, started a record label called Together Records. He brought in Boettcher and Olsen as staff producers, and Boettcher was involved in several projects for the label. These included his first attempt at a solo album, as well as producing recordings for a Sandy Salisbury solo album, contributing to the second Sagittarius album, and co-producing with Olsen &quot;The Moses Lake Recordings&quot; by The Bards, which was a mixture of garage rock with psychedelia and sunshine pop elements. Although the second Sagittarius album, &quot;The Blue Marble&quot;, did see release (and also notched a minor entry on the singles chart with a cover of The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;In My Room&quot;, sung by Boettcher), and several Sandy Salisbury singles were released, the label failed before any of Boettcher&#x27;s other work could be completed. (Some Boettcher projects for Together were released in the early 2000s). Among other Boettcher productions remaining unreleased are sessions for Twice Nicely, guitarist Waddy Wachtel and singer Judy Pulver (co-writers of &quot;Malachi Star&quot;, a song on Boettcher&#x27;s 1973 solo album), a single for (My Three Sons actor) Don Grady of the band Yellow Balloon, and sessions produced with Gary Usher of a guitar duo called Tom and Dick. (Dick was songwriter David Batteau, who would later write songs with and for Boettcher in the band California.) Former Millennium bandmate Ron Edgar played drums on the Tom and Dick sessions. In 1970 Boettcher and Olsen served as mixdown engineers for Emitt Rhodes&#x27; first Dunhill album.

==Solo recording and The Beach Boys==

In the early 1970s, Boettcher had little commercial success and few rewarding recording projects. In 1971, at the insistence of Elektra Records founder-president Jac Holzman, who was a huge fan of &quot;Begin&quot;, Boettcher signed a deal with Elektra. He warned Holzman that the album would take a long time to produce, and started working on a solo album. The project got a boost when Boettcher met a young multi-instrumentalist named Web Burrell; taking a cue from the early one-man albums by Rhodes, Boettcher decided to record the album in a similar fashion, using few musicians other than Burrell. (Boettcher and Burrell collaborated on at least three published songs.) After almost two years of work, &quot;There&#x27;s An Innocent Face&quot; was released in 1973 under the name Curt Boetcher. It was a continuation of the direction that the Millennium had taken with their unreleased post-&quot;Begin&quot; recordings, being a collection of songs with country, sunshine pop, arena rock, and folk stylings. The album was a commercial failure. He attempted to record a follow-up album, tentatively titled &quot;Chicken Little Was Right&quot;, but it was never completed.

In the mid-1970s, Boettcher sang backing vocals on a number of Elton John recordings, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, a duet John recorded with Kiki Dee. He also contributed backing vocals to recordings by Tanya Tucker, Helen Reddy, Eric Carmen and Dennis Wilson.

Thereafter, his output as a musician and producer was limited and sporadic. Beginning in 1975, he worked for several years as a disco DJ throughout southern California. His best-known work in the late 1970s was a 10-minute disco version of &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; by The Beach Boys, which was a moderate hit in 1979 and was included on &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot;; it was a remake of the original recording from their 1967 album &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. As Curt Becher he produced a version of &quot;Shortnin&#x27; Bread&quot; for The Beach Boys that emerged on some bootleg collections. He also produced Mike Love&#x27;s solo album &quot;Looking Back With Love&quot;. Other productions were largely overlooked, such as the Geno Washington album &quot;That&#x27;s Why Hollywood Loves Me&quot; and The Diamonds&#x27; &quot;Live And Well&quot; album. In 1980 he produced new recordings by a later incarnation of The Association, but these tracks were not released. He also produced their 1983 version of &quot;Walk Away Renee,&quot; which was included on a Radio Shack promotional album by Mike Love and Dean Torrence entitled &quot;Rock &amp; Roll City&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Little is known about Boettcher&#x27;s personal life. He married Claudia Ford in the late 1960s, and they had a son, Varek, before they were divorced. A 2013 &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article asserted that Boettcher was gay, and that he tested positive for HIV in the 1980s.

Boettcher died in June 1987 at Los Angeles County Hospital while being treated for a lung infection. His former wife claimed that a blood vessel was clipped in his lung during a biopsy, and the medical staff, fearful of his HIV-positive status, avoided Boettcher while he bled out. Shortly before his death, he set up the Valley Center Studios with musician Mark Antaky and engineer Dave Jenkins.

==Cover versions==
The Brady Bunch recorded Boettcher&#x27;s composition &quot;I Just Want To Be Your Friend&quot; for their 1972 album, &quot;Meet the Brady Bunch&quot; (Paramount Records). Another Boettcher co-composition, &quot;There Is Nothing More to Say&quot;, was sung as a solo by Maureen McCormick on &quot;Chris Knight &amp; Maureen McCormick&quot;, a 1973 album by Brady cast members McCormick and Christopher Knight. The song was reissued as a bonus track on the CD release of The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album.

The Sunshine Company, a Los Angeles rock band, recorded two Boettcher compositions, &quot;I Just Want To Be Your Friend&quot; (on the 1967 album &quot;Happy Is the Sunshine Company&quot;, Imperial Records 12359), and &quot;If You Only Knew&quot; (on the 1968 album &quot;The Sunshine Company&quot;, Imperial Records 12368).

The Hep Stars, a 1960s Swedish rock group whose line-up included Benny Andersson before he went on to greater fame in ABBA, recorded four Boettcher compositions, &quot;Another Time&quot;, &quot;Musty Dusty&quot; (co-written with Tandyn Almer), &quot;Would You Like To Go&quot; (co-written with Jules &quot;Gary&quot; Alexander of the Association), and &quot;Spinning Spinning Spinning&quot; (co-written with Ruthann Friedman).

Eternity&#x27;s Children covered a Boettcher composition, &quot;You Know I&#x27;ve Found a Way&quot; on their 1968 album of the same name. A further cover of the song included Sagittarius, who included it on their album, &quot;Present Tense.&quot;

In April 2013, Beth Sorrentino (formerly of the American rock band Suddenly, Tammy!) released &quot;Would You Like To Go: A Curt Boettcher Songbook&quot;, produced by Sean Slade and issued in Europe on the Basta label. (It was released in North America on June 10, 2014.) The album includes covers of well-known and obscure Boettcher songs and co-writes, as well as an idiosyncratic recording of &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; because of the song&#x27;s strong association with Boettcher. Sorrentino&#x27;s recording of &quot;You Know I&#x27;ve Found a Way&quot; (co-written by Boettcher and Lee Mallory) was used as the soundtrack for the trailer of Rik Cordero&#x27;s film &quot;Starla&quot;.

<text>The International Harvester Company (often abbreviated IH or International) was an American manufacturer of agricultural and construction equipment, automobiles, commercial trucks, lawn and garden products, household equipment, and more. It was formed from the 1902 merger of [[McCormick reaper|McCormick Harvesting Machine Company]] and Deering Harvester Company and three smaller manufacturers: Milwaukee; Plano; and Warder, Bushnell, and Glessner (manufacturers of the Champion brand). Its brands included McCormick, Deering, and later McCormick-Deering, as well as International. Along with the Farmall and Cub Cadet tractors, International was also known for the Scout and Travelall vehicle nameplates. In the 1980s all divisions were sold off except for International Trucks, which changed its parent company name to Navistar International (NYSE: NAV).

Given its importance to the economies of rural communities the brand continues to have a cult following. The International Harvester legacy non-profits host some of the largest agriculture related events in the United States.

Following years of financial and economic decline, International began selling its separate equipment divisions, starting with the sale of the construction division to Dresser Industries in 1982. In November 1984 IH finalized a deal with Tenneco to sell the farm equipment division to Tenneco&#x27;s subsidiary Case Corporation, and the brand continues as Case IH, which is owned by CNH. The European division exists today as McCormick Tractors and is owned by ARGO SpA of Italy. &quot;International&quot; became solely a truck and engine manufacturer and brand and reorganized as Navistar International in 1986. Throughout its existence International Harvester was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. In 2020 Volkswagen agreed to fully purchase the remaining shares of Navistar.

==History==

=== Founding ===


The roots of International Harvester run to the 1830s, when Virginia inventor Cyrus Hall McCormick perfected his version of a horse-drawn reaper, which he field-demonstrated in 1831 and for which he received a patent in 1834. Together with his brother Leander J. McCormick, he moved to Chicago in 1847 to be closer to the Midwestern grain fields and founded the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company. The reaper sold well, partially as a result of savvy and innovative business practices. Their products came onto the market just as the development of railroads offered wide distribution to distant territories. He developed a vast support network to demonstrate field operations. McCormick died in 1884 and his company passed to his son, Cyrus McCormick, Jr..

In 1902, the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and Deering Harvester Company, along with three smaller agricultural equipment firms (Milwaukee Harvesting Machine Co., Plano Manufacturing Co., and Warder, Bushnell, and Glessner—manufacturers of Champion brand) merged to create the International Harvester Company. The most important motivation for the merger was elimination of competition in order to increase profits. Banker J. P. Morgan provided the financing. The architect of the merger was George W. Perkins, one of the Morgan executives who Cyrus McCormick described as the &quot;most brilliant negotiator he had ever known.&quot; The new company was valued at $150 million. 

After a few more years of squabbling the young International Harvester became a near monopoly in reapers, and a major factor in many other farm implements. In 1908 it made 700,000 harvesters worldwide, for $73 million. In addition to 25,000 IH employees there were 42,000 working in its local agencies all over the U.S. and parts of Europe. In 1919, IH bought the Parlin and Orendorff factory in Canton, Illinois, a leader in plow manufacturing, renaming it Canton Works.

===Sustained success===
In 1926, IH&#x27;s Farmall Works built a new plant in Rock Island, Illinois. By 1930, the 100,000th Farmall was produced. IH next set their sights on introducing a true &#x27;general-purpose&#x27; tractor to satisfy the needs of the average American family farmer. The resulting &#x27;letter&#x27; series of Raymond Loewy-designed Farmall tractors in 1939 proved a huge success. IH dominated the market through the 1950s despite stiff competition from Ford, Allis Chalmers, Massey Ferguson and John Deere.

IH ranked 33rd among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts. Different plants of the corporation produced torpedoes and their components, artillery systems and their parts, artillery shells and some civilian products for the military like bulldozers and truck engines. In 1946 IH acquired a defense plant in Louisville, Kentucky, which was adapted for production of the Farmall A, B, and the new 340 tractors. It acquired the Metropolitan Body Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1948. The commercially successful Metro line of forward control vans and trucks were produced here from 1938 until 1964.

In 1970, Pacific Trucks was purchased. In 1974, the five-millionth IHC tractor, a 1066, was produced at the Rock Island Farmall plant.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, despite good sales, IH&#x27;s profit margins remained slim. The continual addition of unrelated business lines created a somewhat unwieldy corporate organization. Overly conservative management and a rigid policy of in-house promotion tended to stifle new management strategies and technical innovation. IH faced strong competition and increased production costs, primarily due to labor and government-imposed environmental and safety regulations.

===Downfall===
In 1977, International Harvester named Archie McCardell as its new CEO, who embarked on a strategy to drastically cut costs and improve profit margins. Unprofitable lines were terminated, and factory production was scaled back, resulting in profits reaching their highest levels in ten years by the end of the year, although cash reserves remained low. This strategy led to growing dissatisfaction among union members. In anticipation of labor disputes, IH braced for a strike. On November 1, 1979, just as the company announced a $1.8 million bonus for McCardell, the United Auto Workers called a strike the following day. The protracted strike eventually cost the company almost $600 million, equivalent to $ billion in .

By 1981, IH&#x27;s finances were at their lowest point ever, and investors had lost faith in the company and its management. In 1982, Louis W. Menk, who was a former president and CEO of the Burlington Northern Railroad, was appointed as IH&#x27;s new chairman and CEO. Under Menk&#x27;s guidance, IH went through a twenty-month reorganization process, and he hired a new management team. Menk also ensured that IH made necessary cutbacks, and it involved the sale of the company&#x27;s Payline division of construction equipment to Dresser Industries. Further assets were sold to Tenneco, Inc., in 1984.

Following the merger, tractor production at Farmall Works ceased in 1985. Production of the new Case IH tractors moved to J.I. Case in Racine, Wisconsin. Production of IH Axial-Flow combines continued at the East Moline, Illinois, factory. The Memphis Works plant was closed. The truck and engine divisions remained and in 1986, Harvester changed the corporate name to Navistar International Corporation, having sold the International Harvester name to Tenneco. Navistar International Corporation continues to manufacture medium- and heavy-duty trucks, school buses, and engines under the International brand name.

==Divisions and products==
===Agriculture Division===
The International Harvester Agricultural Division may have been second to the Truck Division but it was the best-known subsidiary. One of its early products was the Traction Engine, a frame manufactured by Morton Traction Truck Company (later bought by IHC) featuring an IHC engine.

From 1902 to the early 1920s, the McCormick and Deering dealerships kept their original branding with Mogul tractors sold by McCormick and Titan tractors at Deering due to the still-present competitiveness of the former rivals.

====The early tractors====
IH produced a range of large gasoline-powered farm tractors under the Mogul and Titan brands. Sold by McCormick dealers, the Type C Mogul was little more than a stationary engine on a tractor chassis, fitted with friction drive (one speed forward, one reverse). Between 1911 and 1914, 862 were built. These tractors had varied success but the trend going into the mid-1910s was toward &quot;small&quot; and &quot;cheap&quot;.The company&#x27;s first important tractors were the 10-20 and 15-30 models. Introduced in 1915, they were primarily used as traction engines to pull plows and for belt work on threshing machines. The 10-20 and 15-30 had similar Mogul and Titan versions.

Concurrently, IHC purchased a number of smaller competitors. Parlin &amp; Orendorff (P&amp;O Plow) and Chattanooga Plow were purchased in 1919. Other brand names they incorporated include Keystone, D.M. Osborne, Kemp, Meadows, Sterling, Weber, Plano, and Champion.

In 1924 IH introduced the Farmall, a smaller general-purpose tractor, to fend off competition from Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Fordson tractors. Farmall was a leader in the emerging row-crop tractor segment.

Following the introduction of Farmall, several similarly styled &quot;F Series&quot; models were introduced while the original design continued to be produced as the &quot;Regular.&quot;

In 1932, IH produced their first diesel engine for the McCormick-Deering TD-40 crawler. This engine would start on gasoline and then switch to diesel. Other diesel engines of this era were difficult to start in cold weather and using gasoline allowed the engine to thoroughly warm up first. In 1935, it was used in the WD-40, becoming the first diesel tractor on wheels in North America (the world&#x27;s first diesel tractor was Germany&#x27;s Benz-Sendling BS 6 in 1922).

====Heavy tractors====
The market for industrial tractors grew in the 1930s. The TD-40, the first of IH&#x27;s heavy-equipment crawlers, was suited for a wide range of environments. As demand for construction equipment grew, so did the competition. The diversification of the agricultural tractor range into genuine construction equipment whetted appetites for further expansion. In 1937 IH engaged designer Raymond Loewy to revamp its product line and logo. In 1938 the first such model was the TD-65 heavy tractor, later renamed the TD-18.

====The letter and standard series====
For model year 1939, Raymond Loewy created the styling for the Farmall &quot;letter series&quot; (A, B, BN, C, H, and M) and the McCormick-Deering &quot;standard series&quot; (W-4, W-6, and W-9). For 1941 the MD model was introduced as the first row crop diesel-powered tractor; over a decade later, IH&#x27;s largest competitor, John Deere, introduced a diesel option on their row crop models. The letter series tractors were updated to the &quot;super&quot; series in 1953 (with the exception of the A, which had become a &quot;super&quot; in 1947, and the B and BN, which were discontinued in 1948). Many of these tractors (especially the largest, the H, M, and W models) are still in operation on farms today. Especially desirable are the diesel-powered MD, WD-6, and WD-9&#x27;s.

The letter and standard series of tractors was produced until 1954 and was a defining product in IH history.

In 1947, the smallest tractor in the Farmall line was introduced, the Cub. With a 60-cu. in., four-cylinder engine and a 69-inch wheelbase, the Cub was aimed at small farms which had previously relied on horse-drawn equipment. Like the various John Deere L/LA/LI models, one of the &quot;mechanization-resistant&quot; markets it hoped to penetrate was the small one-mule family farms of the rural American Deep South, but the Cub also sold to owners of larger farms needing a second tractor. Production of the Cub commenced at the newly acquired and updated Farmall Works-Louisville plant (formerly the wartime Curtiss-Wright Aircraft factory in Louisville, Kentucky). Selling for $545 in 1947, the Cub proved extremely popular and its design continued largely unchanged mechanically until 1979.

For 1955 in IH tractors, the numbered &quot;hundred series&quot; was offered. Although given slightly different styling and few new features, they were still updates to the models introduced in 1939. The only new tractor in the 1955 lineup was the 300 Utility. In 1957 power was increased in some models and the 230 Utility was introduced.

====Heavy tractors: the 1950s====
IH would sell 38,000 TD-18 series tractors between 1938 and 1958. The TD-18 would be replaced by an upgraded TD-18A in 1949 and 181/182 variants in 1955. In 1958 the TD-20 crawler was introduced.

====60 Series recall====
In July 1958, IH launched a major campaign to introduce a new line of tractors, the 60 series. At the Hinsdale, Illinois, Testing Farm, IH entertained over 12,000 dealers from over 25 countries. The series included the first-of-its-kind six-cylinder 460 and 560 tractors. Unfortunately just a year later, these models were recalled due to final drive component failures. They had not been updated since 1939 and would fail rapidly under the stress of the more powerful 60-series engines. Some customers lost faith in IH and migrated to John Deere&#x27;s New Generation of Power tractors introduced in 1960.

====1960s====
Throughout the 1960s, IH introduced new tractors and new sales techniques. As producing tractors was the lifeblood of the company, IH would have to remain competitive in this field. They both succeeded and failed at this goal but farming was about to change. In 1963, IH introduced the 706 and 806 tractors. Until the 88 series, all numbered series tractors followed a simple numbering system. The first 2-3 digits was the horsepower rating, and the last number was the number of cylinders, so a 1486 was rated 148 hp and had a 6 cyl. engine, while the 1468 had 146 hp and a v8 engine. In 1964, IH made its four-millionth tractor, an 806. In 1965, IH introduced its first two-wheel-drive tractor, the 1206. Another option became available in 1965 for the 706, 806, and the new 1206: a factory-installed cab (made by Stopler Allen Co.), often called the &quot;ice cream box&quot; due to its shape. It could be equipped with a fan and heater. By 1967, over 100,000 models 706, 806, and 1206 were built. The 276 was also built at this time, becoming popular for smaller farms with tighter lanes and fields due to its lighter weight.

In 1967 was the introduction of the bigger and more powerful 56 series tractors as replacements for the popular &quot;06&quot; series. These new models included the 656, 756, the 856, and the 1256. The &quot;ice cream box&quot; cab was still an option. In 1969 IH introduced the 1456 Turbo at . Also that year, the 826 was introduced with the option of gearshift or hydrostatic transmissions. The &quot;ice cream box&quot; cab was dropped and replaced with a new &quot;custom&quot; cab made by Exel Industries which could be equipped with factory air-conditioning, heat, and an AM radio. Another milestone was the 1970 introduction of the 1026 Hydro, basically a hydrostatic version of the 1256 and at that time the most powerful hydrostatic transmission tractor made in the US with .

====1970s====
In 1971, IH introduced the 66 series line. The new models included the 766, the 966, the 1066 turbo, the 1466 Turbo, and the 1468 V-8. The 4166 4WD was also introduced. The 966 and 1066 were available with Hydro or gearshift transmissions and the choice of two-post roll over protection structures (ROPs) or two different cabs, the &quot;custom&quot; and the &quot;deluxe&quot;. Both could be equipped with air conditioning, heat, and AM-FM radios.

In 1972, the 666 replaced the long-running 656, the 1568 V-8 replaced the 1468, and the 1566 and the 4366 4WD were introduced. Also later that year, four-post ROPs replaced two-post; the &quot;custom&quot; cab was dropped and the &quot;deluxe&quot; cab was now painted red instead of white. Due to horsepower confusions, the 966 and 1066 Hydro models were restriped; the Hydro 100 and the 666 Hydro became the Hydro 70. On February 1, 1974, at 9:00 am, the five-millionth tractor came off the assembly line at the Farmall Plant in Illinois; IH was the first tractor manufacturer to reach that number. Also in 1973, IH officially dropped the &quot;Farmall&quot; name from its tractors, ending a name that had begun with the first Farmall &quot;Regular&quot; in 1924.

The 4568 V-8 4WD was introduced in 1975. In 1976, the entire tractor line got a new paint scheme and decal pattern; instead of the side panels being all white with chrome and black decals, they were now all red with a black-striped sticker. This was done to clear inventory for the forthcoming Pro Ag Line.

In September 1976, IH released their 86 series Pro Ag Line. The models included the 786, the 886, the 986, the 186 Hydro, the 1086, the 1486 and the 1586. These tractors had a new cab dubbed the Control Center that came standard with air conditioning, heat, and several radio-CB options. The driver sat well ahead of the rear axle, and the fuel tank was mounted behind the cab over the rear axle. This improved balance and ride. Also in 1976, the 686 along with the &quot;86&quot; series four-wheel-drives were introduced, including the 4186, 4386, 4586, and 4786.

In 1977, International Harvester introduced the first Axial-Flow rotary combine. This machine, produced at East Moline, Illinois, was the first generation of over 30 years of Axial-Flow combines.

In 1979 IH introduced two tractors, the 3388 and 3588, known as the 2+2 4WD line. These were built by taking two 1086 rear ends and hooking them together with a transfer case. A year later, the 3788 was introduced. Although these tractors performed well in the field, they never sold well.

====1980s====
As the 1980s began, IH faced a stable economy, yet an unknown fate. In September 1981, IH announced at a dealership meeting the new &quot;50 Series&quot; of tractors, which included the 5088, the 5288 and the 5488. IH also released the &quot;30 series&quot;, which included the 3088, the 3288, the 3488 Hydro, and the 3688. These new tractors proved once again that IH was innovative. Designed and styled by IH industrial designer Gregg Montgomery (Montgomery Design International), the new stylish design of the 50 and 30 series changed the look of tractors from that time forward. IH spent over $29 million to develop this new series, and the result was the last great lineup of tractors from International Harvester.

Many technology-related innovations were used in the new series. A computer monitoring system (Sentry) was developed, and IH became the first manufacturer to add a computer to a farm tractor. Other innovations included a &quot;Z&quot; shift pattern, an 18-speed synchronized transmission, a forward air-flow cooling system which sucked air from above the hood and blew it out the front grille, &quot;Power Priority&quot; three-pump hydraulic system, color-coded hydraulic lines and controls, and a new rear-hitch system. The 50 Series had an unprecedented three-year or 2,500-hour engine and drive-train warranty, which later became an industry standard. Although no new sales records were set, IH sold a respectable number of these tractors during their short production time. IH also released the &quot;60 series 2+2s&quot; and planned on making the &quot;Super 70 series&quot; 2+2s, but only a handful of these exist today. On May 14, 1985, the last IH tractor rolled off the factory line, a 5488 FWA.

In the late 1970s, IH entered a deal with Spain&#x27;s Enasa to build diesel engines there as &quot;Internacional de Motores&quot;. After a downturn in the market coupled to problems with Spain&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community threatened the profitability of this project, International Harvester withdrew in 1982. In return for being allowed to escape all conditions of the joint venture, IH lost their up-front investment in the engine plant and ended up selling British truck manufacturer Seddon Atkinson (which had belonged to IH since 1974) to Enasa in 1983.

====Brand names of the agriculture division====

IH over the years used a number of brand names to market their tractor and harvesting products:
*International (1902–1985)
*Titan (1910–1924)
*Mogul (1911–1924)
*McCormick–Deering (1922–1947)
*McCormick (1947–1958)
*Farmall (1924–1973)
*Fairway (1924–1938)
*Electrall (1954–1956)
*Cub (1947–1985)

====Other agricultural products====
Along with its prominent tractor division, IH also sold several different types of farm-related equipment, such as balers, cultivators, combines (self-propelled and pull behind), stationary engines, wagons, combine heads, corn shellers, cotton pickers, manure spreaders, hay rakes, crop dusters, disk harrows, elevators, feed grinders, hammer mills, hay conditioners, milking machines, planters, mills, discs, plows, baler twine, and other miscellaneous equipment.

=== Earthmoving division===

IH built up its earthmoving division over a period of time, buying companies and acquiring technology. Its heavy tractor range was an established offering, however IH wanted to offer innovative new construction technology. Significant moves included the purchase of the Frank G Hough company which produced an iconic machine called a PayLoader, and the purchase of French company Yumbo, which produced hydraulic excavators.

Between 1956 and 1982 IH developed and sold a range of off-road dump trucks, which were known commercially as &#x27;PayHaulers&#x27;.

International manufactured and sold an extensive range of heavy equipment. In 1974 IH renamed this division the &#x27;Payline&#x27; division.

==== Payloaders ====
The original payloader model was literally a tractor which had forks welded to the front. Frank Hough was the man who invented the concept and Hough&#x27;s company worked closely with IH until it was purchased in 1952. The terminology came to mean any type of front loader machine, and loaders were manufactured in a number of varieties, included wheeled and track loaders, rear wheel loaders or an articulated steering design.

==== PayScrapers ====

In the early 1950s contractors worldwide began using motor scrapers as a means of shifting dirt. IH had a hole in its product range; it did not offer a motor scraper product to the market. One of IH&#x27;s suppliers, a company named Heil Earthmovers, manufactured a range of scrapers called &#x27;Heiliners.&#x27;

Rather than spend money on R&amp;D and enter the market at a later date, in 1953 IH bought Heil&#x27;s road machinery division, incorporating a range of motor and towed scrapers.

==== Attachments: blades, buckets, rippers and compaction equipment ====
IH International had a supply agreement for its heavy tractor attachments with a
company called Bucyrus-Erie. Amongst a variety of attachment solutions Bucyrus-Erie made a range of cable and hydraulically operated blades which fitted International-Harvester track type tractors.

IH purchased the blades range from Bucyrus-Erie in the 1950s and absorbed these into its machinery division.

IH also purchased attachments for the tractor range from Isaacson, including logging arches and dozer blades. Carrying on with its expansion IH purchased Isaacson&#x27;s attachments division in 1952.

==== Electrall ====
The Electrall system was introduced in 1954; it was a short-lived attempt to market electrically operated farm equipment and accessories. The system, co-developed with General Electric, consisted of a 208 V three-phase alternating-current generator connected with electric cables to the device to be powered. The generator could even power a household. A 10 kW Electrall generator was an option on the Farmall 400 tractor, and a 12.5 kW PTO-driven version was made. The possible applications of Electrall power were many, but few made it to market. IH marketing materials showed a haybaler being Electrall powered. One of the more novel applications of the Electrall was a device to electrocute insects in the field at night (basically like a modern-day bug zapper, but on a larger scale).

==Road vehicles==

===Light duty trucks===
IH is often remembered as a maker of relatively successful and innovative &quot;light&quot; lines of vehicles, competing directly against the Big Three. The most common were pickup trucks. IH made light trucks from 1907 to 1975, beginning with the Model A Auto Wagon (sometimes called the &quot;Auto Buggy&quot;). Production commenced in February 1907 at IH&#x27;s McCormick Works in Chicago, although production was moved to Akron, Ohio, in October that year. Powered by a horizontally opposed, air-cooled twin around , it was a right-hand-drive model popular in rural areas for high ground clearance on the poor roads typical of the era. It featured a rear seat convertible to a carrier bed. The Auto Wagon was renamed the Motor Truck in 1910, and was a forerunner to the successful modern pickup truck. They were called IHC until 1914, when the &#x27;International&#x27; name was first applied. The final light line truck was made on May 5, 1975.

Following the early success with the Auto Buggy, International released their K and KB series trucks in the mid-1940s. They were simpler and sturdier than other trucks released in that era. This was followed by the L series in 1949, which was replaced by the R series in 1952, followed by the S series (a name re-used later for IH&#x27;s larger medium-duty trucks) in 1955. In 1957, to celebrate IH&#x27;s golden anniversary as a truck manufacturer, this was replaced by the new A line. &#x27;A&#x27; stands for anniversary. With light modifications to its appearance, but more serious changes under the shell (and a number of new names), this design continued in production until replaced by the 1100D in late 1969, which looked very similar to the Scout which was already in production.

Corresponding with the truck &quot;letter lines&quot; was the Metro line of step (delivery) vans. Starting in 1938 and manufactured through 1975, the Metro series was produced and updated with each iteration of IH&#x27;s truck lines. Also, special-use variants were sold, such as the Metro Coach (a bus version with windows and passenger seats) and Metro front-end section and chassis for full commercial customization. Additional variants were based on the medium-duty engine and chassis lines.

IH abandoned sales of passenger vehicles in 1980 to concentrate on commercial trucks and school buses.

The Scout and Light Truck parts business was sold to Scout/Light Line Distributors, Inc. in 1991.

==== Sport-utility vehicles ====
One of the company&#x27;s light-duty vehicles was the Travelall, which was similar in concept to the Chevrolet Suburban. The Travelette was a crew cab, available in two- or four-wheel drive. A three-door version was available starting in 1957, and a four-door version was available starting in 1961. The 1961 Travelette four-door (crewcab) was the first six-passenger, four-door truck of its time.

The Scout, first introduced in 1961, is a small, two-door SUV, similar to a Jeep. In 1972, the Scout became the Scout II, and in 1974, Dana 44 axles, power steering, and power disc brakes became standard. After the Light Line pickups and Travelall were discontinued in 1975, the Scout Traveler and Terra became available, both with a longer wheelbase than a standard Scout II.

===Motorhomes===
In the 1970s, motorhomes were manufactured using IHC engines and bare chassis. Most of the bodies were constructed of fiberglass.

===Commercial trucks (Truck and Engine Division) ===
International Harvester was an early manufacturer of medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Although based upon truck chassis, IH also became the leading manufacturer of the chassis portion of body-on-chassis conventional (type C) school buses. In 1962, IH offered the International Harvester Loadstar which became the premier medium-duty truck. In 1978, IH offered the International Harvester S-Series, which replaced the Loadstar in 1979.

With the truck and engine divisions remaining following the 1985 sale of the agricultural division, International Harvester Company changed their corporate name to Navistar International in 1986. Today, Navistar International&#x27;s subsidiary, International Truck and Engine Corporation, manufactures and markets trucks and engines under the International brand name. From 1983 to 2010, Ford Motor Company offered International V8 diesel engines in heavy-duty pickup trucks, vans, and SUVs (using the Power Stroke name after 1994).

==== 1960s ====
In 1961, the DCO-400 &quot;Emeryville&quot; model line was expanded with a conventional; officially named the D-400, the model line shared its cab with the COE and was the first International conventional produced with a tilting hood.

In 1962, International began to phase out the R-line series of trucks (dating to 1953). In place of a comprehensive model line ranging from half-ton pickup trucks to its largest Class 8 trucks, International introduced two purpose-built model lines for commercial use. Slotted above its Light Line pickup trucks, the Loadstar was a medium-duty conventional-cab truck. For 1963, International introduced the heavier-duty Fleetstar, a short-hood conventional slotted between the Loadstar and the heavier-duty R and V-Line conventionals. While no longer serving as a comprehensive model range, the Loadstar shared its cab with the A-series pickup truck (and its derivatives); as a cowled chassis, the Loadstar was produced for bus use (the IHC Schoolmaster). Sharing only its name with its conventional-cab namesake, the Loadstar CO was a low-cab COE (with a forward-tilting cab).

In 1965, International introduced the CO-4000, the first heavy-duty COE designed entirely by the company, replacing the DCO-400 &quot;Emeryville&quot; COE (which sourced its cab design from Diamond T). In a design feature that would be adopted by International COEs into the 1990s, the cab was designed with a large trapezoidal grille.

In 1968, International redesigned the Fleetstar, adopting the cab of the Light Line pickups. Renamed the Fleetstar-A, the redesign marked the consolidation of the Fleetstar with the previous R-line and V-line trucks. The largest R-210 and R-230 remained (dropping their R prefix) alongside the newly introduced M-series as the largest International trucks, sharing a common cab (dating back to 1952). The Transtar name made its first appearance, as the CO-4000 was replaced by the Transtar CO4070/4090; while visually similar to its predecessor, the Transtar CO was designed with an all-new cab (to accommodate larger diesel engines).

For 1969, International introduced the final version of the Emeryville model line, with the DC-400 Transtar 400 replacing the D-400.

==== 1970s ====
In 1970, International split the CO Loadstar into its own product line, dubbed the Cargostar. As part of a model update, the Cargostar received a larger grille and wider cab than its predecessor. Competing directly against the Ford C-Series, the Cargostar was a medium-duty truck fitted with a choice of gasoline or diesel engine (shared with the Loadstar conventional).

1971 marked the end of the &quot;Emeryville&quot; product lines, as the DC-400 Transtar 400 was replaced by the Transtar 4200/4300. Developed as a Class 8 highway tractor, the Transtar 4200/4300 introduced an all-new cab that continued to be used for International heavy-duty trucks through 1999. Competing against a wide range of manufacturers, the Transtar conventional was offered in both short and long-hood configurations for both regional and long-distance shipping.

In 1972, the Paystar 5000 series was introduced, replacing the 210/230 and M-series trucks (which dated to 1952). Developed for severe-service use (primarily construction and related applications), the Paystar shared its cab with the Transtar, but used a heavier-duty chassis, steel fenders, and a flat-panel hood. The medium-duty Loadstar received an optional tilting hood with a larger grille and straighter-edge fenders (updating its appearance for the first time in 10 years).

In 1974, the Transtar II COE was introduced, following a redesign of the Transtar. Recognizable by its top-mounted windshield wipers, the Transtar II standardized the previous raised-cab option, as the previous 852-cubic-inch Detroit Diesel 12V71 V12 was replaced by some of the largest-displacement engines that had ever been fitted to a road-going vehicle at that time, including the Cummins KTA diesel I6 (1,150 cubic inches) and the Caterpillar 3408 diesel V8 (1,099 cubic inches). On the other end of the size scale, the Cargostar underwent a second update, with a slightly wider cab and a much larger grille (which shares the black trim band of the Transtar COE grille).

For 1976, International launched its &quot;Eagle&quot; flagship brand, used into the 2010s.

In 1977, the International S-series was introduced, consolidating the Fleetstar and Loadstar into a single model range. While less comprehensive than the product ranges of the 1930s to the 1950s, the S-series product line included medium-duty, heavy-duty, severe-service, and highway trucks (along with a new generation of the Schoolmaster bus chassis) in the Class 5 to Class 8 size ranges. At its 1977 launch, the S-series was introduced to replace the Fleetstar; lighter-duty models to replace the Loadstar were phased in during 1979. Competing against an extensive segment of the truck industry, the S-Series was produced in multiple layouts, hood lengths, and axle configurations; gasoline and diesel engines were offered.

Produced as a cowled chassis (Schoolmaster), straight truck, or semitractor, the S-Series was produced from 1977 to 2004, making it the longest-ever production run for the company (as either International Harvester or Navistar).

==== 1980s ====
In 1981, International introduced the CO9670, replacing the Transtar II. Sharing only the trapezoidal grille with the previous Transtar II, the CO9670 was designed with a larger cab with improved visibility and improved access (larger windshield, shared doors with the Transtar/Paystar conventional); to increase fuel economy, the Cummins KTA diesel was replaced by a turbocharged Cummins N-series I6.

For 1985, the Transtar conventional was reintroduced, becoming the International 9000 series; while the short-hood Transtar was discontinued (overlapped by the S2200 and S2300 Class 8 tractors), the long-hood 4300 was renamed the International 9370. Sharing its cab with the Transtar, the 9370 was restyled with a larger grille and vertically stacked quad headlamps.

After seeing almost no change since 1974, International ended production of the Cargostar (the final Loadstar-based truck). As the company did not develop a tilt-cab truck derived from the S-series (or a distinct vehicle), International introduced the 400/500/700/900 low-cab COE, produced by Nissan Diesel (UD). The first imported vehicle marketed by the company, the 400-900 was marketed through 1991. 

==Overseas subsidiaries==

===Australia===


====Australian Army designs====
International Harvester Australia, a subsidiary of the US manufacturer, had a long relationship with the Australian Army with the US-designed AS series trucks in the early 1950s. The AS164 4x2 used as a tractor unit and the 4x2 AS161 used as a trayback troop transport

The association between International Harvester Australia and the Australian Army developed and in conjunction with the Army Design Establishment of the Australian Commonwealth Department of Supply, designed and constructed a range of trucks for the Australian Army. With the body loosely based upon the design of cab 13 of the Canadian Military Pattern truck, the first prototype built in 1959 was the International Truck Cargo Ton General Service, Australian No.1 Mk1. which was followed by the Mk2 prototype. A variant with a midmounted, 20,000-lb winch, resulted in the first production model, the Mk3 entering service in 1963 – just in time for Australia&#x27;s entry into the Vietnam War.

A five-ton 6×6 version was to follow with three major variants the Truck Cargo 5 Ton with winch F1 which replaced the Mk3 in Vietnam service.

The F2 a tipper version that replaced the International Harvester AB160 &quot;teaspoon Tipper&quot; in both Vietnam and Borneo theatres of operations.

The F5 wrecker with a lack of 4×4 ton trucks available because of the Vietnam War, the Mk3 was supplemented with further 4×4 production with the updated Mk4 version which shared the cab with the 6×6 variants Production of The Australian No.1. range of trucks were produced until 1973. The Mk3, Mk4, F1, F2 and F5 saw service until the late 1980s.

====ACCO====
The Australian designed and built International Australian A-line Cab Over (AACO) was first produced in the late 1960s and later in 1972 the Australian C-line Cab Over (ACCO) . The ACCO is a cab over engine type truck and has been offered in 4x2, 4x4, 6x2, 6x4, 8x4, and 10x4 configurations. Engines used have been Cummins, Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, Perkins, Neuss or GMC with Road-Ranger or Allison transmissions and Rockwell differentials. The ACCO range were built to order, serving private operators, fire departments, military services, and municipal departments across Australia and New Zealand. The cabs for NZ assembled Accos were welded, painted, wired, glazed and trimmed, using locally sourced parts and materials, by Steel&#x27;s Motor Assemblies which was formed by the parent truck trailer making company in the mid-1960s to assemble Prince/Nissan Gloria sedans and later also assembled Toyota Corona sedans and other models. Upholstery vinyl was shared with the contemporary Toyota cars. The ACCO became the most popular product of International Harvester in Australia. The ACCO was discontinued in November 2019 and replaced by a locally built European designed ACCO, under the ownership of Iveco.

===Brazilian subsidiary===
International Harvester Máquinas S.A. was established with Brazilian government support as part of a project to develop a vehicle industry there. Their first product was the International S-184 heavy truck. In 1966 Chrysler purchased International&#x27;s Brazilian plant.

==Home products==

===Home appliances===
Although best known for farm equipment, IH produced home appliances for farmers and nonfarmers alike. This included refrigeration equipment such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and freezers. IH had a refrigeration division of its own, as did other vehicle manufacturers of the time: Ford had Philco, Chrysler had Airtemp, General Motors had Frigidaire, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation (and then American Motors) had Kelvinator, Studebaker had the Franklin Appliance Company, and Crosley had Crosley.

The IH appliance division had originally been developed to manufacture commercial-grade items to farmers, most of whom had just received electricity by way of the many electrification projects in the U.S. before and after World War II. Among the offerings were milk coolers and walk-in freezers for produce and meat. Later on, IH courted the farmer&#x27;s wife with kitchen refrigerators available in the latest designer styles. The IH spokeswoman for these products was Irma Harding, a factory trademark. These products were introduced in 1947 and sold for less than 10 years. The refrigeration division was sold to Whirlpool Corporation in 1955. Since the duration of production was short, IH appliances are rare today.

On the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, the refrigerator in Monica&#x27;s apartment is a circa 1950 International Harvester. Several close-ups can be seen in Season 8, Episode 17, &quot;TOW The Tea Leaves.&quot; 

===Lawn and garden===
IH branched out into the home lawn and garden business in 1961 with its line of Cub Cadet equipment, which included riding and walk-behind lawn mowers and snow blowers. Also produced were compost shredders, rotary tillers, Cadet garden tractors, and power washers.

The Cub Cadet line was sold to MTD Products in 1981.
==Other products==

===Defense===
IH manufactured light, medium, and heavy vehicles for military use. Examples include a Metro van sold to the Czechoslovakian Army in 1938, M5 tractors and 2.5-ton M-5H-6 trucks for the US Navy and Marines in 1942, and around 3,500 2.5 ton M-5-6-318 cargo trucks provided mostly to the Soviet Union and China.

====Weapons====
In early 1951, the United States Army through the Springfield Armory contracted International Harvester to produce M1 rifles, and from 1953 to 1956 IH produced 337,623 rifles in total, according to the Army Ordnance Department.

===HT-341===
In 1959, International Harvester created a jet turbine-powered tractor called the International HT-341. It was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1967.

<doc id="1035248" wikidata="Q6027594" url="?curid=1035248" title="Industrial District, Seattle">
<text>The Industrial District is a neighborhood and the principal industrial area of Seattle, Washington. It is bounded on the west by the Duwamish River and Elliott Bay, beyond which lies Delridge of West Seattle; on the east by Interstate 5, beyond which lies Beacon Hill; on the north by S King and S Dearborn Streets, beyond which lie Pioneer Square and southwest International District of Downtown; and on the south by the main lines of the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad, or about S Lucille Street, beyond which is Georgetown. [[SoDo, Seattle|SoDo]] is the name of the northwest portion of the neighborhood, named for its being South of Downtown. SoDo is the location of T-Mobile Park, home of the Seattle Mariners, and Lumen Field, home of the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Sounders FC. Lumen Field was also the site of the former Kingdome.

The Industrial District may also be defined by land use, with the primarily residential and open space Delridge district extending west from W Marginal Way SW and south of SW Spokane Street, and with the heavy industrial-zoned lower Duwamish River east of Marginal and north of Spokane as part of the Industrial District.

Most of the Industrial District is built on what was once the mudflats and lowlands of Elliott Bay and the Duwamish estuary, dredged, straightened, and filled 1902 and 1907. Much of the area is also built on landfill which is prone to liquefaction. This makes buildings in this area highly prone to earthquake damage.

Principal arterials are First and Fourth Avenues S, Alaskan Way, East Marginal and Airport Ways S (north- and southbound); and S Spokane, the Spokane Street Viaduct, West Seattle Bridge, and S Royal Brougham Way (east- and westbound; Royal Brougham was formerly S Atlantic Street). Minor arterials are 6th Avenue S, S Holgate and S Lander Streets, and S Industrial Way.

== History ==
What is now Seattle has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago). For example, the villages of &quot;tohl-AHL-too&quot; (&quot;herring house&quot;) and later &quot;hah-AH-poos&quot; (&quot;where there are horse clams&quot;) at the then-mouth of the Duwamish River in what is now the Industrial District, had been inhabited since the 6th century CE. The &quot;Dkhw’Duw’Absh&quot; and &quot;Xacuabš&quot;
(&quot;People of the Inside&quot; and &quot;People of the Large Lake&quot;, now the Duwamish tribe) of the Lushootseed (Whulshootseed, Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish nations inhabited at least 17 villages in the mid-1850s, living in some 93 permanent longhouses (khwaac&#x27;ál&#x27;al) along Elliott Bay, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, Lake Washington, Lake Sammamish, and the Duwamish, Black, and Cedar rivers.

In 1905 the Seattle Box Company relocated to the southeast corner of 4th Avenue S and S Spokane Street becoming one of the first residents of the Industrial District.

Starbucks moved its world headquarters to the Industrial District in 1997, occupying the 1912 building constructed for Sears, Roebuck and Company as a catalog distribution center.

Some current industrial business owners are concerned about the future of the Industrial District.
The area is seen by some city developers as an ideal zone in which to expand non-industrial businesses and residential land use south of Downtown Seattle.

==Economy==
Uwajimaya has its headquarters in the Industrial District.

<doc id="1035250" wikidata="Q506193" url="?curid=1035250" title="Said bin Sultan">
<text>Sayyid Saïd bin Sultan al-Busaidi (, , ) (5 June 1791 – 19 October 1856) was Sultan of Muscat and Oman, the fifth ruler of the Busaid dynasty from 1804 to 4 June 1856. His rule began after a period of conflict and internecine rivalry of succession that followed the death of his father, Sultan bin Ahmad, in November 1804. He is often referred to as the Lion of Oman (), as one of the greatest Omani sultans.

Said&#x27;s uncle Qais bin Ahmad finally agreed to Said&#x27;s primacy after Said had killed his cousin, Badr bin Saif, a pretender to the throne. Said is noted for moving his capital to Zanzibar, where it remained during the time when the Omani Empire reached the zenith of its power and wealth.

==Early years==

Said bin Sultan was son of Sultan bin Ahmed, who ruled Oman from 1791 to 1804. Sultan bin Ahmed died in 1804 on an expedition to Basra. He appointed Mohammed bin Nasir bin Mohammed al-Jabry as the Regent and guardian of his two sons, Salim bin Sultan and Said bin Sultan. Sultan&#x27;s brother Qais bin Ahmad, the ruler of Sohar, decided to attempt to seize power. Early in 1805 Qais and his brother Mohammed marched south along the coast to Muttrah, which he easily captured. Qais then started to besiege Muscat. Mohammed bin Nasir tried to bribe Qais to leave, but did not succeed.

Mohammed bin Nasir called on Badr bin Saif for help.
After a series of engagements, Qais was forced to retire to Sohar. Badr bin Saif became the effective ruler.
Allied with the Wahhabis, Badr bin Saif became increasingly unpopular.
To get his wards out of the way, Badr bin Saif made Salim bin Sultan governor of al Maṣna&#x27;ah on the Batinah coast and Said bin Sultan governor of Barka.

In 1806, Said bin Sultan lured Badr bin Saif to Barka and murdered him nearby. There are different accounts of what happened, but it seems clear that Said struck the first blow and his supporters finished the job. Said was acclaimed by the people as a liberator from the Wahhabis, who left the country. Qais bin Ahmad at once gave his support to Said. Nervous of the Wahhabi reaction, Said blamed Mohammed bin Nasir for the murder.

==Sultan==

Said bin Sultan became the sole ruler of Oman, apparently with the consent of his brother. Their aunt, the daughter of the Imam Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi, seems to have influenced this decision.

In 1820, he launched a punitive expedition against the Bani Bu Ali with the assistance of the East India Company. It was defeated, but the following year a larger Company force returned and defeated the tribe.

In 1822, he signed the Moresby Treaty, restricting the Zanzibar slave trade.

In 1835, he ratified a treaty with the United States on very favorable terms, that had been negotiated by Edmund Roberts at Muscat on 21 September 1833, and returned by USS &quot;Peacock&quot;.

In 1837, he conquered Mombasa (now in Kenya). In 1840, Said moved his capital from Muscat to Stone Town in Zanzibar, where Richard Waters was American Consul, and sent a ship to the United States to try to further a trading relationship.

In 1843 he nominated a nominal representative in Mogadishu and was forced to pay tribute to Sultan Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim of the Sultanate of the Geledi.

In 1845, he signed the Hamerton Treaty, further restricting the Zanzibar slave trade. 

Upon Said&#x27;s death in 1856, his realm was divided. His third son, Thuwaini bin Said, became the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, and his sixth son, Majid bin Said, became the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The National Museum in Muscat houses numerous items of silverware and other possessions that belonged to Said.

<doc id="1035259" wikidata="Q1799659" url="?curid=1035259" title="Jay Gibbons">
<text>Jay Jonathan Gibbons (born March 2, 1977) is an American former professional baseball right fielder in Major League Baseball.
He played college baseball at California State University, Los Angeles and in the Major Leagues for the Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles Dodgers. He attended Mayfair High School in Lakewood, California.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Gibbons was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 14th round, 411th overall, of the 1998 amateur draft and that season captured the Pioneer League Triple Crown with the Medicine Hat Blue Jays, hitting .397 with 19 home runs and 98 RBI. After the 2000 season, he was picked up by the Baltimore Orioles in the Rule 5 draft.

===Baltimore Orioles===
As a rookie for the Orioles in 2001, he hit 15 home runs before a hand injury cut short his season. The next year, he hit a career-best 28 homers. In 2003, Gibbons had another excellent season. Playing in a career-high 160 games, he established personal bests with a .277 batting average and 100 RBI and was voted Team MVP.

In 2004, Gibbons suffered multiple injuries and only played in 97 games. Because of his hobbling injuries, his numbers plummeted: his batting average was a mere .246, and he hit only 10 homers. After the 2004 season, he had LASIK eye surgery to improve his declining eyesight, which went from 20–10 to 20–35 in only a few months. He bounced back with a solid 2005 season as he hit .277 with 26 home runs and 79 RBI in 139 games.

He wore No. 25 until Rafael Palmeiro signed a contract with the Orioles in 2004. Out of respect for the older and more established Palmeiro, Jay switched to No. 31, which he wore for the rest of his time with the Orioles, even after Palmeiro left the Orioles.

====Steroid allegations====
On September 30, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that former relief pitcher Jason Grimsley, during a June 6, 2006, federal raid, told federal agents investigating steroids in baseball that Gibbons was a user of anabolic steroids. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that Gibbons was one of five names blacked out in an affidavit filed in federal court. However, on October 3, 2006, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that San Francisco United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report contained &quot;significant inaccuracies.&quot; Gibbons, along with the other four players named, denounced the story. However, on September 9, 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that a source close to an Orlando-based compound pharmacy alleged that Gibbons had received multiple shipments of performance-enhancing steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) between October 2003 to July 2005.

On December 13, 2007, he was cited in the Mitchell Report.

He was suspended for the first 15 games of the 2008 season on December 6, 2007, and performed so poorly in 2008 spring training that the Orioles cut him even though he was owed nearly $12 million for the last two years of his contract. The Orioles management claimed that the release was a &quot;baseball decision&quot; unrelated to the steroid allegations.

===Long Island Ducks===

On June 12, 2008, Gibbons wrote an emotional letter to all 30 MLB clubs, asking to return to baseball, promising to donate his salary to charity. The only team that gave him a chance was the independent Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League, a team unaffiliated with MLB. He played in 27 games for the Ducks, hitting .280 with five home runs in 107 at-bats.

===Milwaukee Brewers===

On July 22, 2008, Gibbons signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers and was assigned to the Double-A Huntsville Stars. Gibbons spent approximately one week at Double-A Huntsville before being promoted to Triple-A Nashville on July 27. He became a free agent after the season.

===Florida Marlins===
Gibbons signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Florida Marlins on January 13, 2009. He was released by the Marlins on March 13, 2009; the Marlins stated that they did not have room on the roster for him.

===Newark Bears===
On May 11, 2009, Gibbons agreed to play for the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League. In 40 games he hit .233/.286/.387 with 4 home runs and 19 RBIs.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Gibbons signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 2010 season. He was assigned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes to start the season and was selected to the mid-season Pacific Coast League all-star team. In 94 games with the Isotopes, he hit .347 with 19 home runs.

Gibbons was called up to the Dodgers on August 8, 2010. In the game that day against the Washington Nationals, he hit a pinch-hit RBI single. Two days later, Gibbons started in left field against the Philadelphia Phillies, finishing 3–4 with a home run and three RBI.

He appeared in 37 games with the Dodgers, getting extensive playing time after the trade of Manny Ramirez. He finished hitting .280 with five home runs and 17 RBI.

On November 4, 2010, Gibbons signed a one-year deal to remain with the Dodgers. He began to experience some vision problems while playing winter ball in Venezuela and saw some eye specialists when the problem persisted through spring training, causing him to lose his chance to be the team&#x27;s regular left fielder. The problems continued into April and he began the season on the disabled list while trying out different contact lenses. He was even concerned that his career might be over. After an extended rehab assignment at AAA Albuquerque that lasted for most of April, he was activated on May 3. He appeared in 24 games, hitting .255 before he was designated for assignment on June 6. He returned to the Isotopes, where he played in 76 games the rest of the season, hitting .300 with nine home runs and 46 RBI. He became a free agent after the season.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
Gibbons signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers in February 2012. He retired from baseball as an active player on July 9.

===Coaching===
In 2015, he became a hitting coach for the Dodgers Class-A team in the Midwest League, the Great Lakes Loons. The following season, he was promoted to the hitting coach job with the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes in the California League.

<doc id="1035263" wikidata="Q6197458" url="?curid=1035263" title="Jim Penner">
<text>Jim Penner (September 4, 1939 – January 17, 2004) was a businessman and politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Manitoba legislature from 1999 to 2003.

Penner was born in Rosthern, Saskatchewan and moved to Steinbach, Manitoba in 1946 at the age of 7, where his father bought a grocery store. Penner grew the store into &quot;Penner Foods Limited&quot;, with six locations, a company for which he was President and CEO from 1962 to 1998 (overseeing a business which employed 800 workers). Penner was appointed to Trinity Western University&#x27;s Board of Governors in 1981. He was a graduate of Trinity University in Chicago and was awarded an honorary degree in 2001.

In 2002 Penner was honoured as the Humanitarian of the Year by the Variety Club of Manitoba.

Penner was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the general election of 1999, running as a Progressive Conservative in the rural, southern riding of Steinbach. Penner defeated his nearest opponent by almost 5000 votes, despite the fact that the Progressive Conservatives were defeated provincially.

In the Manitoba Legislature, Penner served as opposition critic for Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Finance. He chose not to run for re-election in 2003, having been diagnosed with cancer. Penner died on January 17, 2004.

<doc id="1035264" wikidata="Q881892" url="?curid=1035264" title="Russell W. Peterson">
<text>Russell Wilbur Peterson (October 3, 1916 – February 21, 2011) was an American scientist and politician from Wilmington, Delaware. He served as Governor of Delaware as a member of the Republican Party. An influential environmentalist, he served as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality and president of the National Audubon Society.

==Early life and family==
Peterson was born in Portage, Wisconsin, the son of Emma (Anthony) and Johan Anton Peterson. The eighth of nine children, his father was an immigrant from Sweden who worked as a bartender and barber. Peterson attended the University of Wisconsin where he received a B.S. in 1938, working as a dishwasher in the chemistry lab to pay the bills and a Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1942. In 1937 he married Lillian Turner, with whom he had four children: R. Glen, Peter J., Kristin P. Havill and Elin. Lillian died in 1994. He married his second wife, June Jenkins, who had been recently widowed, in 1995. He was a Unitarian Universalist.

At Wisconsin, Peterson was elected to Phi Beta Kappa society.

==Professional and political career==
After graduate school, Peterson was recruited by the E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company to work as a research chemist at its Experimental Station in Wilmington. For over 26 years he held prominent jobs in research, manufacturing and sales, and finally in corporate management, becoming director of research and development in 1963.

All the while, Peterson had become a well-known civic activist from suburban New Castle County. He had been involved in the &quot;New Day for Delaware&quot; attempt at governmental reform in the Boggs administration and had organized an effort at prison reform known as the &quot;Three-S Citizen&#x27;s Campaign,&quot; salvage people, save dollars, and shrink the crime rate. His leadership skills inspired Henry B. du Pont to appoint him to the executive committee of the Greater Wilmington Development Council. He was put in charge of the Neighborhood Improvement Program, tasked with solving poverty in the black community. By 1968 Delaware had experienced rioting following the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., and National Guard troops were still on the streets of Wilmington on the orders of the conservative Democratic Governor, Charles L. Terry, Jr. Peterson seemed to have a fresh, progressive approach for addressing these and other issues and was drafted by Republican state leaders to run for governor.

==Governor of Delaware==

Peterson was elected Governor of Delaware in 1968, defeating incumbent Governor Charles L. Terry Jr by a vote of 104,474 (51%) to 102,360 (49%). His first act was to remove the National Guard from Wilmington. His administration was one that enacted several substantial changes, with perhaps the biggest change being the successful implementation of the old &quot;New Day for Delaware&quot; plan that transformed the organization of state government. Delaware&#x27;s executive departments had been run by commissions, appointed by the governor, but with considerable policy independence, and overlapping terms. As a result, the governor had control over his departments only through persuasion and the budget. The newly enacted law provided for an eleven-person cabinet organization, with department leadership provided by persons serving at the pleasure of the governor. In all, Peterson eliminated 100 commissions and boards. Neither Peterson nor his successor, Sherman W. Tribbitt, were fully able to take advantage of this change, but their successors all made it one of the foundations of the present Delaware state government.

Peterson was also a dedicated environmentalist and the guiding force behind the Coastal Zone Act of 1971. This act protected Delaware&#x27;s inland bays and waterways by banning heavy industry from a two-mile-wide strip of Delaware&#x27;s 115 mile coastline, about 20% of the state. The major consequence of the Act was preventing Shell from building a $200m oil refinery. This piece of legislation has since been used by other states to protect their shorelines. During his tenure as governor Peterson chaired the Education Commission of the States from 1970 to 1971. When Maurice Stans, the Secretary of Commerce under Richard Nixon complained to Peterson that the Act harmed America&#x27;s security and prosperity, Peterson listed a dozen ways in which companies could continue their work without harming Delaware&#x27;s coastline. The Act was unsuccessfully challenged in court, and Peterson led the environmental movement in Delaware by sporting a badge on his lapel that said, &quot;To Hell with Shell!&quot;

These were a breathtaking number of changes for normally conservative Delaware – Peterson appointed the first person of color, Arva Jackson, to the University of Delaware&#x27;s board of trustees, insisted on the hiring of black people to the State Police, pressed for the state&#x27;s open housing law and relaxed abortion laws. In 1972, Delaware became the last state to outlaw flogging as a form of punishment, removing &quot;Red Hannah&quot;, America&#x27;s last whipping post.

Meanwhile, in spite of warnings, Peterson seemed to be unaware of growing financial problems for the state. Finally, in June 1971, Peterson admitted he had made revenue miscalculations resulting in a $5 million deficit. The mistake opened the door to opponents of the other changes to unleash a barrage of criticism. As a result, when he sought a second term the next year, he won the Republican primary by 8% of the vote over former Lieutenant Governor David P. Buckson. In the general election, he was defeated by Democratic former Lieutenant Governor and then State House minority leader Sherman W. Tribbitt by a vote of 117,274 (51%) to 109,583 (48%) after announcing an unexpected tax increase in the middle of the campaign. He left office with Delaware enjoying a budget surplus.
==Later career==
Upon leaving office in January 1973, Peterson was recruited by Nelson Rockefeller to spearhead establishment of what later became known as the Commission on Critical Choices for Americans. In December of 1973, Rockefeller championed Peterson&#x27;s appointment, by President Richard Nixon, as Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. Peterson served at CEQ from 1973 to 1976, leading a task force on the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons and helping to shape environmental reviews as mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act. In 1976, Peterson left CEQ to lead a new international citizens&#x27; action group, New Directions, which was modeled on Common Cause. Just over a year later, Peterson left New Directions to become director of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). 

A keen bird watcher, Peterson took up the hobby after taking his son to the Everglades in 1954 and identified over 1,000 birds during his life. Peterson served as the president of the National Audubon Society from 1979 to 1985. He fought Ronald Reagan&#x27;s attempts to weaken environmental regulations, pushed the society beyond its traditional remit into areas like energy policy, toxic waste and population control. He hired more scientists, started an environmental curriculum for school children and got Ted Turner to finance the TV series &quot;The World of Audubon&quot;, narrated by Robert Redford, amongst others.

Peterson served as a visiting professor at Dartmouth College in 1985, Carleton College in 1986, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1987. He also served as president of the International Council for Bird Preservation, as a principal officer in three international environmental organisations, worked for the United Nations on various activities and as chairman of the Center on the Long-Term Biological Consequences of Nuclear War, working with Carl Sagan, Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter Raven to employ scientists to inform world leaders of the dangers of nuclear weapons.
In October 1996 Peterson switched his party affiliation to the Democratic Party, after endorsing Democrats in presidential elections since 1988.

In 1971 the National Wildlife Federation gave Peterson the &quot;Conservationist of the Year&quot; award. In 1974, Peterson received the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award for public service from the American Chemical Society. In 1982, Russell W. Peterson was honored to be selected as the Swedish-American of the year by the Swedish Council of America (previously the Vasa Order of America). In 1984 he was given the Robert Marshall Award by the Wilderness Society. In 1995, the League of Conservation Voters awarded him its lifetime achievement award. In 2007 he was inducted into the &quot;Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame&quot;.

The Russell W. Peterson Urban Wildlife Refuge, just outside Wilmington, has been named in his honor.

In April 2008, a small ship was rechristened &quot;Russell W. Peterson.&quot; The ship, owned by Aqua Survey Inc. was used for the study of migratory bird routes. However, on May 12, 2008, the &quot;Russell W. Peterson&quot; was destroyed in a storm off the Delaware coast, killing one of its two crew members.

Peterson suffered a stroke on the morning of Monday, February 21, 2011, and died at 8:10pm that evening at home. He was survived by his wife, four children, seventeen grandchildren and sixteen great-grandchildren.

<doc id="1035267" wikidata="Q4388313" url="?curid=1035267" title="Unrolled linked list">
<text>In computer programming, an unrolled linked list is a variation on the linked list which stores multiple elements in each node. It can dramatically increase cache performance, while decreasing the memory overhead associated with storing list metadata such as references. It is related to the B-tree.

==Overview==
A typical unrolled linked list node looks like this:

 record node {
 &quot;node&quot; next &quot;// reference to next node in list&quot;
 &quot;int&quot; numElements &quot;// number of elements in this node, up to maxElements&quot;
 &quot;array&quot; elements &quot;// an array of numElements elements,&quot;
 &quot;// with space allocated for maxElements elements&quot;

Each node holds up to a certain maximum number of elements, typically just large enough so that the node fills a single cache line or a small multiple thereof. A position in the list is indicated by both a reference to the node and a position in the elements array. It is also possible to include a &quot;previous&quot; pointer for an unrolled doubly linked list.

To insert a new element, we find the node the element should be in and insert the element into the codice_1 array, incrementing codice_2. If the array is already full, we first insert a new node either preceding or following the current one and move half of the elements in the current node into it.

To remove an element, we find the node it is in and delete it from the codice_1 array, decrementing codice_2. If this reduces the node to less than half-full, then we move elements from the next node to fill it back up above half. If this leaves the next node less than half full, then we move all its remaining elements into the current node, then bypass and delete it.

==Performance==
One of the primary benefits of unrolled linked lists is decreased storage requirements. All nodes (except at most one) are at least half-full. If many random inserts and deletes are done, the average node will be about three-quarters full, and if inserts and deletes are only done at the beginning and end, almost all nodes will be full. Assume that:
* &quot;m&quot; = codice_5, the maximum number of elements in each codice_1 array;
* &quot;v&quot; = the overhead per node for references and element counts;
* &quot;s&quot; = the size of a single element.
Then, the space used for &quot;n&quot; elements varies between formula_1 and formula_2. For comparison, ordinary linked lists require formula_3 space, although &quot;v&quot; may be smaller, and arrays, one of the most compact data structures, require formula_4 space. Unrolled linked lists effectively spread the overhead &quot;v&quot; over a number of elements of the list. Thus, we see the most significant space gain when overhead is large, codice_5 is large, or elements are small.

If the elements are particularly small, such as bits, the overhead can be as much as 64 times larger than the data on many machines. Moreover, many popular memory allocators will keep a small amount of metadata for each node allocated, increasing the effective overhead &quot;v&quot;. Both of these make unrolled linked lists more attractive.

Because unrolled linked list nodes each store a count next to the &quot;next&quot; field, retrieving the &quot;k&quot;th element of an unrolled linked list (indexing) can be done in &quot;n&quot;/&quot;m&quot; + 1 cache misses, up to a factor of &quot;m&quot; better than ordinary linked lists. Additionally, if the size of each element is small compared to the cache line size, the list can be traversed in order with fewer cache misses than ordinary linked lists. In either case, operation time still increases linearly with the size of the list.

<doc id="1035275" wikidata="Q3101194" url="?curid=1035275" title="Sekitori">
<text>A sekitori (関取) is a &quot;rikishi&quot; (力士, sumo wrestler) who is ranked in one of the top two professional divisions: &quot;makuuchi&quot; and &quot;jūryō&quot;.
The name literally translates to having taken the barrier, as only a relatively small fraction of those who enter professional sumo achieve &quot;sekitori&quot; status.

Currently there are 70 &quot;rikishi&quot; in these divisions. The benefits of being a &quot;sekitori&quot; compared to lower ranked wrestlers are significant and include:
* to receive a salary and bonus (those in the lower divisions merely receive an allowance)
* to have one&#x27;s own supporters&#x27; club
* to wear high quality men&#x27;s kimono and other items of attire
* to have a private room in the training stable
* to be able to get married and live away from the training stable
* to have junior &quot;rikishi&quot; to effectively act as their personal servants
* to wear a silk &quot;mawashi&quot; with stiffened cords (called &quot;sagari&quot;) in tournament bouts 
* to participate in the ring entrance ceremony and wear a &quot;keshō-mawashi&quot;
* to wear the more elaborate &quot;ōichō chonmage&quot; hairstyle in competition and on formal occasions
* to become an elder in the Sumo Association if one is &quot;sekitori&quot; for long enough

==Memorabilia associated with &quot;sekitori&quot;==
The item of memorabilia most often associated with sumo wrestling is &quot;tegata&quot; (literally hand shape). Only &quot;sekitori&quot; are allowed to make them for fans. They could be equated to the sumo version of an autograph. &quot;Tegata&quot; consist of a print of a wrestler&#x27;s hand using black or red ink accompanied by his ring name written in calligraphic style by the wrestler himself. Original &quot;tegata&quot; are given out to fans and members of one&#x27;s supporter club. Printed copies of &quot;tegata&quot; can also be bought inexpensively.

==Supporter clubs==
When a wrestler achieves &quot;sekitori&quot; status, he is allowed to have a fan/supporter club called a &quot;kōenkai&quot; if he has enough popularity. This is in addition to &quot;kōenkai&quot; associated with his sumo stable. These clubs often pool their money to buy the wrestler such items as his decorative apron called a &quot;keshō-mawashi&quot;. For their support, supporter club members expect and receive access to the wrestlers and are given invitations to post-tournament parties and other events where they will have direct contact with them.

<doc id="1035276" wikidata="Q889847" url="?curid=1035276" title="Faisal bin Turki, Sultan of Muscat and Oman">
<text>Faisal bin Turki, GCIE (8 June 1864 – 4 October 1913) (), historic spelling &quot;Fessul bin Turkee&quot;, ruled , from 4 June 1888 to 4 October 1913 as Sultan of Muscat and Oman, as the state of Oman was known at the time. He succeeded his father Turki bin Said as Sultan. Upon his death in 1913, he was succeeded by his eldest son Taimur bin Faisal.

==Life==
On assuming power in 1888, Faisal ibn Turki gradually found his authority over the interior weakened as tribal leaders increasingly perceived his dependence on British advisers as an inherent weakness. In 1895 he was forced to seek refuge at Jalali Fort after Muscat was captured. British political agents frustrated his efforts to recapture Muscat, compelling him to court the French. He granted the French coaling facilities for their fleet at Bandar Jissah near Muscat.

Determined to thwart any growth in French presence in what Britain considered its sphere of influence, Britain presented Faisal ibn Turki with an ultimatum in 1899 ordering the sultan to board the British flagship or Muscat would be bombarded. Having little recourse, Faisal ibn Turki capitulated. Publicly humiliated, his authority was irreversibly damaged. In 1903 he asked Lord George Nathaniel Curzon, viceroy of India, for permission to abdicate, but his request was denied. Responsibility for the capital was delegated to Said ibn Muhammad Al Said, while affairs of the interior fell to an ex-slave, Sulayman ibn Suwaylim. By 1913 control over the interior was completely lost, and a reconstituted imamate was again a threat to Muscat. In May 1913, Salim ibn Rashid al Kharusi was elected imam at Tanuf and spearheaded a revolt against the sultan that combined both Hinawi and Ghafiri tribal groups.

On Faisal&#x27;s death, he was succeeded by his second son, Taimur bin Faisal. Sultan Haitham, the current ruler of Oman, is a direct descendant of Faisal bin Turki.

==Family==
Faisal Bin Turki had 24 children:

<text>Semirechyenskoe Cossack Host () was a Cossack host in Imperial Russia, located in the Semirechyenskaya Oblast (today comprising most of Kyrgyzstan as well as Almaty oblysy, Taldy-Korgan (Taldyqorghan) oblysy, and parts of the Taraz oblysy and Semey oblysy in Kazakhstan) with the center in Verny.

The Semirechyenskoe Cossack Host was created out of a portion of the Siberian Cossack Host in 1867. It was commanded by a &quot;nakazny&quot; or ataman (who was also the military governor of the oblast). From 1882, the Semirechye Ataman was responsible to the Governor General of the Steppe; and from 1899 the Governor General of Turkestan.

In the early 20th century, the Semirechye Cossask Host supplied 1 cavalry regiment (4 sotnyas) and 1 platoon of local guards in times of peace. In times of war the host provided 3 cavalry regiments and 12 detached sotnyas. The Semirechyenskoe Cossasks possessed 7,440 km2 of land, including 710 km2 of arable land. In 1916, The Cossack population in this region numbered approximately 45,000 people.

The Semirechyenskoe Cossask Host played a role in the expansionist colonial policy of the Tsar in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Semirechyenskoe Cossacks took part in the conquest of Central Asia and in World War I. During the Russian Civil War, the prosperous leadership of the Semirechyenskoe Cossask Host opposed the Soviets. After the defeat of the White movement in the Steppes in April 1920, the Semirechyenskoe Cossask Host was disbanded. As part of the process of &quot;Decossackization&quot;, its former leaders were forcibly transferred to the Russian Extreme North.
==Distinctions==
The distinguishing colour of the Semirechyenskoe Cossack Host was &quot;raspberry red&quot; (crimson); worn on the cap bands, shoulder straps and wide trouser stripes of a green uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. Officers wore silver epaulettes and braid. High fleece hats were worn on occasion, with crimson cloth tops. Until 1908 cossacks from all hosts were required to provide their own uniforms; together with horses, saddlery and sabers. However the prosperous Semirechyenskoe Host was able to maintain its own clothing factories and stores as community owned resources.

<text>Anton Karl Thraen (17 January 1843, Holungen, Province of Saxony – 18 February 1902, Dingelstädt) was a German astronomer and named two minor planets, 442 Eichsfeldia and 443 Photographica.

==Biography==
Thraen was born on 17 January 1843 in Holungen, in the Prussian Province of Saxony, where he attended the elementary school at that time. In 1863, he completed his schooling in Heiligenstadt and went to Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster (1863–66), and the University of Paderborn (1866–68) and learned theology. Already in Munster, he also knew mathematical and astronomical lectures and helped at the observatory.

From 1883 up to his death, he worked as a minister in Dingelstädt. Here, he organised charitable collections for the development of the hospital and the parish church. By night he often observed the sky with his telescope, particularly working on the orbits of comets and minor planets, publishing his results in international technical periodicals.

Despite going blind in his left eye, this work was continued. He observed the short-period Comet III (Wolf) in 1884-85 with 950 observations and in 1891-92 with 681 observations, and calculated its orbit to forecast the third return. Thraen also discovered several new asteroids, which received the name &quot;Eichsfeldia&quot; and the name &quot;Photographica&quot; from Professor Wolf.

Thraen was honoured by the Prussian state in 1900 with the award of the Roten-Adlerordens, IV class. Only in 1902 at a conference in Göttingen did he become personally acquainted with many astronomers, with whom he had previously only been in contact with by post. In August of that year, he fell ill with incurable gastric trouble, and died on 18 December 1902.

Asteroid 4098 Thraen, discovered by Dr. Börngen of the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in Tautenberg in 1987 is named for the Dingelstädter minister and astronomer. At his parents&#x27; house in Holungen in 1956, a plaque was attached in his memory. The city of Dingelstädt has a street named after Thraen.

<doc id="1035299" wikidata="Q218319" url="?curid=1035299" title="Zofia Nałkowska">
<text>Zofia Nałkowska (, 10 November 1884, in Warsaw, Congress Poland – 17 December 1954, in Warsaw) was a Polish prose writer, dramatist, and prolific essayist. She served as the executive member of the prestigious Polish Academy of Literature (1933–1939) during the interwar period.

==Biography==
Nałkowska was born into a family of intellectuals dedicated to issues of social justice, and studied at the clandestine Flying University under the Russian partition. Upon Poland&#x27;s return to independence and the establishment of the Second Polish Republic she became one of the country&#x27;s most distinguished feminist writers of novels, novellas and stage-plays characterized by socio-realism and psychological depth.

==Literary output==
Nałkowska&#x27;s first literary success was the &quot;Romans Teresy Hennert&quot; (The Romance of Teresa Hennert, 1923) followed by a slew of popular novels. She is best known for her books &quot;Granica&quot; (Boundary, 1935), the &quot;Węzły życia&quot; (Bonds of Life, 1948) and &quot;Medaliony&quot; (&quot;Medallions&quot;, 1947).

In her writing, Nałkowska boldly tackled difficult and controversial subjects, professing in her 1932 article &quot;Organizacja erotyzmu&quot; (Structure of Eroticism) published in the &quot;Wiadomości Literackie&quot; magazine – the premier literary periodical in Poland at the time – that:

...a rational, nay, intellectual approach to eroticism must be encouraged and strengthened, to allow for a consideration of eroticism in conjunction with other aspects of the life of the human community. Eroticism is not a private matter of the individual. It has its ramifications within all domains of human life and it is not possible to separate it from them by way of contemptuous disparagement in the name of morality, discretion, or yet by a demotion on the hierarchy of subjects worthy of intellectual attention: it cannot be isolated by prudery or relegated to science for its purely biological dimension.&quot;
==Tribute==
On 10 November 2014 Google celebrated her 130th birthday with a Google Doodle.

From May 2024, a manuscript Nałkowska&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.

<doc id="1035310" wikidata="Q2461933" url="?curid=1035310" title="Sunshine pop">
<text>Sunshine pop (originally known as soft pop) is a subgenre of pop music that originated in Southern California in the mid-1960s. Rooted in easy listening and advertising jingles, sunshine pop acts combined nostalgic or anxious moods with &quot;an appreciation for the beauty of the world&quot;. The category largely consists of lesser-known artists who imitated more popular groups such as the Mamas &amp; the Papas and the 5th Dimension. While the Beach Boys are noted as prominent influences, the band&#x27;s music was rarely representative of the genre.

Sunshine pop enjoyed mainstream success in the latter half of the decade, with many of its top 40 hits peaking in the spring and summer of 1967, especially just before the Summer of Love. Popular acts include the Turtles and the Association. Other groups, like the Millennium, Sagittarius, and the Yellow Balloon were less successful but gained a cult following years later with albums like &quot;Begin&quot; (Millennium, 1968) and &quot;Present Tense&quot; (Sagittarius, 1968) being sought on the collectors’ market.

==Etymology==
Music identified under the sunshine pop banner initially was called &quot;soft pop&quot;. It was also called “soft rock” in Japan, where it led to the rediscovery of sunshine pop (it is still often called &quot;soft rock&quot; as well). Record collectors coined and popularized the term &quot;sunshine pop&quot; many decades after the fact.

==Origins and characteristics==


Sunshine pop originated in California in the mid to late-1960s, beginning as an outgrowth of the California Sound and folk rock movements. Rooted in easy-listening, advertising jingles, and the growing drug culture, the music was characterized by lush vocals and light arrangements similar to samba music. Most of the acts were lesser-known bands named after fruits, colors, or cosmic concepts that imitated popular groups like the Beach Boys, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, and the 5th Dimension. In some ways, the genre is similar to baroque pop through being elaborate and melancholic, but it crossed into folk-pop and Brill Building styles. It may be seen as a form of escapism from the turmoil of the times. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Noel Murray writes: &quot;sunshine pop acts expressed an appreciation for the beauty of the world mixed with a sense of anxiety that the good ol&#x27; days were gone for good.&quot;

Some of the artists who influenced the style include Curt Boettcher, the Mamas &amp; the Papas&#x27; John Phillips, and the Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson. Concerning the Beach Boys&#x27; involvement with sunshine pop, the orchestral style of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966) was imitated by many Los Angeles record producers, but &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; notes: &quot;Though [the Beach Boys] ... were hugely influential on the sunshine pop acts that followed, [their] music was rarely in step with the genre.&quot; &quot;The Suburban&quot;″s Joel Goldenburg believes the closest the group ever came to the genre was the lightly produced album &quot;Friends&quot; (1968): &quot;the vocals of sunshine pop songs are a little more anonymous and not as lushly featured as that of The Beach Boys. And I don&#x27;t see the [Phil] Spector connection. The light touch applied to the songs reminds me more of soft samba music.&quot; Murray says that &quot;John Phillips, on the other hand, practically created the blueprint for sunshine pop, with little of Wilson&#x27;s uncommercial weirdness.&quot; Brian Wilson commented that &quot;you can turn the Beach Boys upside down ... just the track or whatever, and I think they [the Mamas &amp; the Papas] have as much vocal as we do track ... whereas, I think, we emphasize a little more track than vocal.&quot;

Sunshine pop and the California Sound&#x27;s influence expanded to other countries. In Spain, it initially was pioneered by groups like Pic-Nic, Granada Los Ángeles and Los Iberos in 1968. Between 1969 and the 1970s there was a boom of &quot;soft pop&quot; acts in the country, among them Los Yetis, Solera, Módulos, Nuevos Horizontes and Vainica Doble.

==Rediscovery==
After its peak in the 1960s, the genre lingered in near-obscurity, although it enjoyed some interest among collectors of rare vinyl singles and LPs. Select albums would occasionally fetch hefty prices at online auctions or in record stores. A name was eventually given to the music, &quot;sunshine pop&quot;, although it was rarely deployed outside of record collecting circles. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the &quot;soft rock boom&quot; in Japan began to generate renewed interest, and Japanese record companies, seeing a commercial opportunity, began publishing compilations and reissues of forgotten and obscure music from the 1960s. This revival then spread to Europe and the United States.

Compilations and box-sets by groups such as Spanky and Our Gang, the Association, the Arbors and the Love Generation have been released on CD. Among the record labels which issue sunshine pop re-releases are Rev-ola Records in Britain and the US label Sundazed.

<text>Gernrode () is a historic town and former municipality in the Harz District, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 1 January 2014, it has been part of Quedlinburg. It was the seat of the former &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;municipal association&quot;) of Gernrode/Harz.

First mentioned in 961, Gernrode received the privilege to bear its own coat of arms and seal, commonly regarded as town privileges. The town is best known for the Ottonian church of Saint Cyriakus, the collegiate church of a former Imperial chapter of nuns, and as the start of the narrow gauge Selke Valley Railway.

==Geography==
Gernrode is situated at the northeastern rim of the Harz mountain range and the Harz/Saxony-Anhalt Nature Park, about south of Quedlinburg. It lies at above sea level, at the foot of the Ramberg massif. It is nationally recognized for its health facilities and has state recognition as a spa town, where one may take the cure and recuperate in general (&quot;staatlich anerkannter Kur- und Erholungsort&quot;).

The town is also known as &#x27;Gernrode/Harz&#x27;, because of its location in the Harz mountains, and to distinguish it from Gernrode in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, also called &#x27;Gernrode (Eichsfeld)&#x27;.

== History ==
In 959 the Saxon margrave Gero founded a convent of canonesses in the &quot;Schwabengau&quot; territory, within the grounds of the &quot;Geronisroth&quot; fortification he built about the same time. He also founded the collegiate church for the convent, which King Otto I took under his special protection by a 961 deed. It was dedicated to Saint Cyriacus, whose relics Gero brought back for the church from his second journey to Rome in 963. Without male heirs, he bequested his vast properties to the convent and made his daughter-in-law Hathui (d. 1014), widow of his son Siegfried, first abbess (r.959-1014). She was succeeded by Adelaide I (r.1014-1045), a sister of Emperor Otto III, who was also Princess-abbess of Quedlinburg (r.999-1045).

Initially the Gernrode convent was on a par with the Imperial abbeys of Quedlinburg and Gandersheim. However, its secular &quot;Vogt&quot; protectors from the Ascanian princes of Anhalt, descendants of Albert the Bear, became increasingly powerful. Yet in 1188, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa held a &quot;Hoftag&quot; in Gernrode and donated a bell to the St. Stephan church (&quot;Stephanikirche&quot;, also known as the Market church or &quot;Marktkirche&quot;), the second historical church in Gernrode built in 1046. In the thirteenth century, Adelaide II was abbess of Gernrode (r.1207-1220).

The Protestant Reformation came to Anhalt and Gernrode in 1521. A Protestant elementary school was founded in 1533 according to the ideas of Martin Luther. Closely linked to the University of Wittenberg, the premises were used as a school until 1847, when it moved into St Stephen&#x27;s Church, and may be the oldest such school in Germany. In 1565 Elisabeth of Anhalt-Zerbst (1545–1574) became abbess of Gernrode and the convent was led by Ascanian princesses ever since. It was finally disbanded in 1614, when the last abbess Sophia Elizabeth (1589–1622), daughter of the Ascanian prince John George I of Anhalt-Dessau, married Duke George Rudolf of Liegnitz.

Gernrode received brewing rights in 1545. Beer brewing has since stopped, but a distillery is still present in the city. The city was traditionally part of the Duchy of Anhalt and a district of Ballenstedt. From 1037 to 1740 lead and silver were mined here. Matches and guns were also made in Gernrode. Parts of Gernrode were burnt in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (twice, in 1631 and 1635). In 1728 Emperor Charles VI formally enfeoffed the Anhalt princes with Gernode which was incorporated into Anhalt-Bernburg, raised to a duchy in 1806.

Due to its picturesque setting, Gernrode became a popular destination for recreational visitors from the early 19th century onwards. Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist and Wilhelm von Kügelgen stayed here, followed by numerous vacationers, and tourism became a significant economic factor. The town had 2,533 (Protestant) inhabitants in 1885.

On 19 April 1945, at the end of World War II, Gernrode was taken by the US Army without a battle, followed by occupation by Soviet troops in June. As part of the Soviet occupation zone, Gernrode belonged to East Germany from 1949 until German reunification in 1990. It celebrated its 1,000th year in 1961 and 450th year as a town in 1989. In 2001, celebrations to honour Emperor Otto I were held. Between 1 January 2011 and 19 February 2013, Gernrode was part of the town Quedlinburg, and again after 1 January 2014.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===

==== Selke Valley Railway ====
Gernrode is the starting point of the Selke Valley Railway (&quot;Selketalbahn&quot;), a narrow-gauge railway. The line was built in 1887 and after initially climbing through the mountains, follows the Selke river valley to Stiege. The total length from Gernrode to Stiege is 35 km.

== Attractions==

Attractions include the giant cuckoo clock (whose cuckoo appears every fifteen minutes), which was listed in the Guinness Book of Records in 1998. This is part of a clock factory, which also incorporates a giant weather house indicating current weather conditions. Other local attractions include a 7.45 m giant wood thermometer, the largest Skat table in the world, and the Prussia Tower on the Ölbergshöhe.

<text>Alfentanil (R-39209), sold under the brand name Alfenta among others, is a potent but short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug used for anesthesia in surgery. It is an analogue of fentanyl with around one-fourth to one-tenth the potency, one-third the duration of action, and an onset of action four times faster than that of fentanyl. Alfentanil has a pKa of approximately 6.5, which leads to a very high proportion of the drug being uncharged at physiologic pH, a characteristic responsible for its rapid-onset. It is an agonist of the μ-opioid receptor.

While alfentanil tends to cause fewer cardiovascular complications than other similar drugs such as fentanyl and remifentanil, it tends to give stronger respiratory depression and so requires careful monitoring of breathing and vital signs. Almost exclusively used by anesthesia providers during portions of a case where quick, fast-acting (though not long-lasting) pain control is needed (as, for example, during nerve blocks), alfentanil is administered by the (injected) route for fast-onset and precise control of dosage.

Discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1976, alfentanil is classified as a Schedule II drug in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/listby_sched/sched2.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself and include itching, nausea and potentially life-threatening respiratory depression. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.

<text>Tony the Tiger is the advertising cartoon anthropomorphic tiger mascot for Frosted Flakes (also known as Frosties) breakfast cereal, appearing on its packaging and advertising. After the original Kellogg Company spun off its North American cereal business in late 2023, the mascot is owned by WK Kellogg Co in the U.S., Canada, and Caribbean markets and by Kellanova in the rest of the world. Tony has also been the mascot for related cereals such as Tony&#x27;s Cinnamon Krunchers and Tiger Power. Since Tony&#x27;s debut in 1952, the character has spanned several generations and has become a breakfast cereal icon.

==History==
In 1952, Eugene Kolkey, an accomplished graphics artist and art director at Leo Burnett, created a character that was to become the official mascot of Kellogg&#x27;s new breakfast cereal. Kolkey designed a tiger named Tony (named after an ad man at Leo Burnett—Raymond Anthony Wells) and selected Martin Provensen for the finished artwork. The cereal had other mascots like Katy the Kangaroo, Elmo the Elephant, and Newt the Gnu. Within the year, the other mascots were dropped (with Elmo and Newt never once gracing the front of the box), and Tony was given a son, Tony Jr. Tony the Tiger eventually became a cereal icon. The final Tony the Tiger design came from a group of former Disney animators known as Quartet Films, which also designed the Jolly Green Giant, Snap, Crackle and Pop, the Hamm&#x27;s Beer Bear, and the Baltimore Orioles mascot, among others. Stan Walsh, Art Babbitt, Arnold Gillesspie, and Michael Lah were the artists/filmmakers that formed the Quartet Films of Hollywood.

A 1955 print ad in &quot;Life&quot; had Tony taking a microphone away from &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; host Groucho Marx and saying, &quot;You bet your life they&#x27;re Gr-r-reat!&quot;

A recognizable and distinct voice was needed for the Tony the Tiger character. Initially, he was voiced by Dallas McKennon, but shortly after the initial Sugar Frosted Flakes advertisements aired, McKennon was replaced by Thurl Ravenscroft, who spent the next five decades providing the characteristic deep bass voice associated with the character, notably the familiar &quot;They&#x27;re gr-r-reat!&quot; catchphrase. Thurl Ravenscroft came up with this phrase. Ravenscroft spoke to an interviewer of injecting his personality into Tony: &quot;I made Tony a person. For me, Tony was real. I made him become a human being and that affected the animation and everything.&quot;

In 1958, Tony appeared on Kellogg&#x27;s cereal boxes with Hanna-Barbera characters such as Huckleberry Hound and Snagglepuss.

Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s; he was given an Italian-American nationality and consumers were briefly introduced to more of Tony&#x27;s family including Mama Tony, Mrs. Tony, and a daughter, Antoinette. Tony was a popular figure among the young Italian-American population and it showed in 1974, where he was deemed &quot;Tiger of the Year&quot; in an advertising theme taken from the Chinese Lunar Calendar. The advertising theme declared, &quot;This is the Year of the Tiger and Tony is the Tiger of the Year.&quot; Later that year, Tony graced the covers of &quot;Italian GQ&quot; and &quot;Panorama&quot;. In addition to Tony&#x27;s success, during this decade, son Tony Jr. was even given his own short-lived cereal in 1975, Frosted Rice. Provensen&#x27;s original art design for the tiger has changed significantly over the years, as Tony the whimsical, cereal-box-sized tiger with a teardrop-shaped head was replaced by his fully-grown son Jr., who is now a sleek, muscular sports enthusiast—he was a coach for the Monster Wrestlers in My Pocket and a referee for the Monster Sports Stars in My Pocket (see Monster in My Pocket). Tony the Tiger was never limited to American cereal boxes, appearing on Kellogg&#x27;s European brand cereal boxes.

Tony frequently appears in American commercials as an animated character in a live-action world, frequently with his drawn image rotoscoped over a live character, such as an extreme sports athlete, allowing Tony to not just appear in live-action, but interact as well.

The longtime voice of Tony, Thurl Ravenscroft, died in 2005. In North America, he was replaced from 2005 onwards by announcer Lee Marshall, who maintained the role until his death from cancer in 2014. In the United Kingdom, Tony is voiced by Californian-born British actor, Tom Clarke Hill. For some time in the UK, the rock song &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; by Survivor was used in conjunction with Tony&#x27;s viewings. In Canada, Tony is voiced by animation, commercial, and promo voice artist Tony Daniels.

&quot;Put a Tiger on Your Team&quot; was featured in ads all across the nation in 1958 as Kellogg&#x27;s cereal campaign reached out all children sports organizations and teams to build more consumers. In the same year of 1958, Tony the Tiger was joined by other popular mascots to promote the newest cereal release &quot;pre-sweetened cereals.&quot; Mass media and marketing during this time was on the rise, especially in the food product industry. In the wake of Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes the cereal company&#x27;s goal was to produce a flavor that was &quot;delicious and distinctive flavor.&quot; In 1974, after the Kellogg Company launched a Chinese Year of the Tiger, for marketing and advertising techniques Tony was selected as Tiger of the Year. Following a few months later was the release of an innovative Tony the Tiger commercial. This commercial was significant in the humanizing factor of Tony with the birth of his first daughter, Antoinette. This advertising technique targeted the millions of infants as Antoinette the baby tigress was shown tasting Kellogg&#x27;s Sugar Frosted Flakes for the first time, followed by the Tony the Tiger slogan. The shape of the featured tiger was beginning to shape the cereal marketing and advertising sector by promoting new product lines. The company used Tony Jr. as its mascot to introduce nearly six new products that are high in nutrition in the mid-1970s. Throughout all of the 1970s, Tony the Tiger had a complete family of three. The evolution of this brand icon continued to rise as Tony the Tiger was featured in a Hot Air Balloon Championship in 1981.

In 2019, it was announced that Kellogg&#x27;s would become the title sponsor of the Sun Bowl, an El Paso, Texas-based college football bowl game, with the game being branded as the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. The sponsorship transferred to WK Kellogg after the 2023 corporate split.

In August 2022, Tony the Tiger made his debut as a VTuber on Twitch.

==Character design==
Tony&#x27;s design has changed over the course of the character&#x27;s history. 
The original Tony the Tiger was more typically tiger-like in shape and was sometimes depicted walking on all fours; he wore a kerchief around his neck and had a football-shaped head. Ultimately, this was tweaked into a more muscular, human-like form.

==Trademark controversy==
Tony the Tiger began his trademark debut with Kellogg in 1952. The Tiger was used as a cartoon character featured on every box of Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes. The feline was federally registered as Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes trademark. Furthermore, the registration and classification was under food products. Twelve years later one of the top oil companies, Esso (now ExxonMobil), began using a similar tiger as a promotional mascot for gasoline products. Exxon then followed through with protocol and federally registered its tiger under the petroleum products category. Unlike the Kellogg slogan behind the voice of Thurl Ravenscroft, &quot;They’re gr-r-reat!&quot;, Esso also had a slogan, &quot;Put a tiger in your tank&quot;.

The two major companies shared peaceful relations between the two iconic tigers. From 1952 to 1995, the companies combined spent over a billion and a half dollars in advertising in the cereal and petroleum industries. Neither company faced any issues with each other—however, in 1992 this all changed. ExxonMobil opened a new business sector and product line through the promotion of the existing Exxon Tiger. The company failed to expand its federal trademark registration to its newest product line sector. Prior to Exxon&#x27;s newest business addition of opening convenience stores (&quot;Tiger Marts&quot;) and selling foods and beverages, the company was cleared of all trademark litigations. After the announcement of ExxonMobil&#x27;s new product line, Kellogg quickly filed a suit. The latest unnamed tiger Exxon was using to sell food and beverages crossed the trademark boundaries. The confusion of using very similar tigers as a mascot for food products did not sit well with Kellogg. The lawsuit consisted of trademark infringement and dilution, and sought an injunction prohibiting the further use of the Exxon tiger. After several court appearances, millions of dollars, different rulings, and years of waiting, the two parties settled the case.

Tracing back to 1986, Kellogg battled with a different situation with regard to trademark. During the preparation of the 1988 Summer Olympics South Korean organizers agreed on the games&#x27; mascot Hodori which was very similar to Kellogg&#x27;s Tony the Tiger. The very popular cereal company had concerns about the similarity and raised some red flags with trademark registration that same year. Kellogg continued to stress that Tony the Tiger was an advertising tool used on almost every cereal box, so a comparable tiger only differentiated by the addition of distinct five-ringed Olympic badge around his neck would cause confusion. Sports news and critics stirred up much controversy and it is remembered as the &quot;Hold That Tiger&quot; battle for the tiger trademark.

==Health concerns and legal status across countries==
Tony the Tiger, as well as other mascots featured in products targeted to children (such as Chester Cheetah and fellow Kellogg&#x27;s mascots such as Toucan Sam), has been the subject of controversy in several countries. A study published in the journal &quot;Obesity Reviews&quot;, suggested familiar media character branding appeared to be &quot;a powerful influence on children&#x27;s preferences, choices and intake of less healthy foods.&quot; Tony and similar mascots, have been banned from being featured in packaging and advertising in countries like Chile, Peru, Argentina and Mexico. A study by a coalition that included Action on Sugar and Children&#x27;s Food Campaign in the UK, found that 51% of 526 assessed &quot;child-friendly&quot; food and drink products with popular cartoon characters on their packaging were high in sugar, saturated fat, salt and fat, with only 18 healthy products such as fruit, vegetables and water were found to use child-friendly cartoons. Tom Watson of the Labour Party said using playful characters to appeal to children is “grossly irresponsible”, and the Health and Social Care Select Committee issued calls for a blanket ban on ‘brand-generated characters or licensed TV and film characters which are used to promote foods high in fat, sugar or salt.&quot; Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks dropped 25 percent in the 18 months after Chile adopted these regulations, which also included octagon front-of-package warning labels and a ban on junk food in schools.

<doc id="1035348" wikidata="Q58337310" url="?curid=1035348" title="Clytius">
<text>Clytius (Ancient Greek: Κλυτίος), also spelled Klythios, Klytios, Clytios, and Klytius, is the name of multiple people in Greek mythology:

* Clytius, one of the Giants, sons of Gaia, killed by Hecate during the Gigantomachy, the battle of the Giants versus the Olympian gods.
* Clytius, an alternative name for Clytoneus, the son of Naubolus of Argos and father of Nauplius II.
* Clytius, son of Agriopas and grandson of Cyclops. He fought in the war between Eumolpus and Eleusis and fell alongside Eumolpus&#x27; son Immaradus and Egremus, son of Eurynomus.
* Clytius, the Athenian father of Pheno who married King Lamedon of Sicyon. Ianiscus, descendant of this Clytius, became king in Sicyon after Adrastus.
* Clytius, a man killed by Perseus in the battle against Phineus.
* Clytius, a warrior in the army of Dionysus during the god&#x27;s Indian campaign. He was killed by Corymbasus.
* Clytius, an Argonaut and an Oechalian prince as son of King Eurytus and Antiope or Antioche, and thus brother to Iole, Toxeus, Deioneus, Molion, Didaeon and Iphitos. According to Hyginus, he was killed by Aeetes, if the text is not corrupt; according to Diodorus Siculus, however, he was killed by Heracles during the latter&#x27;s war against Eurytus.
* Clytius, in a rare version of the myth, a son of Phineus and brother of Polymedes: the two brothers killed Phineus&#x27; second, Phrygian, wife (Idaea?) at the instigation of Cleopatra.
* Clytius, a Trojan prince as the son of King Laomedon and brother of the later ruler Priam. He was also one of the Elders of Troy during the siege of the city. By Laothoe, he was the father of Caletor, Procleia and Pronoe or Pronome, of whom the latter was the mother of Polydamas by Panthous.
* Clytius, son of Alcmaeon and Alphesiboea. He moved from Psophis to Elis in order to escape his mother&#x27;s vengeful brothers. The Clytidae, a clan of soothsayers, claimed descent from him. According to Stephanus of Byzantium, his mother was Triphyle, the eponym of Triphylia.
* Clytius, each of the three namesakes among the Suitors of Penelope: one from Dulichium, another from Same, and the third from Zacynthus. These men asked the hand in marriage of Penelope but suffered the same fate at the hands of the hero Odysseus. The latter shot all of them dead with the aid of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
* Clytius, an attendant of Telemachus in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the father of Telemachus&#x27; friend Peiraeus. Dolops, a Greek warrior killed by Hector in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, could also have been his son.
* Clytius, one of the sons of Aeolus who followed Aeneas to Italy and was killed by Turnus.
* Clytius, father of Euneus (one of those killed in the battle between Aeneas and Turnus).
* Clytius, a young soldier in the army of Turnus who was loved by Cydon in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, and was killed by Aeneas.
* Clytius, father of Acmon and Menestheus from Lyrnessus, Phrygia.

To these can be added several figures not mentioned in extant literary sources and only known from various vase paintings:

*Clytius, a companion of Peleus present at the wrestling match between Peleus and Atalanta.
*Clytius, an arms-bearer of Tydeus present at the scene of murder of Ismene, on a vase from Corinth.
*Clytius, a barbarian-looking participant of a boar hunt, possibly the Calydonian hunt, on the Petersburg vase #1790.
*Clytius, a man standing in front of the enthroned Hygieia, on a vase by the Meidias Painter.
*Clytius, an epithet of Apollo, in an inscription.

<text>Geisleden is a municipality in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, Germany. It is located about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) southeast of Heiligenstadt in the valley formed by the river Geislede. Other neighboring towns are Westhausen in the north, Kreuzebra to the east, and Heuthen toward the southeast.

Historical records show that Geisleden existed at least as early as the 11th century. For example, in 1028 A.D., a provincial synod was held in this old town. Geisleden belonged to the Electorate of Mainz until 1802 when it was incorporated into the province of Saxony in the Kingdom of Prussia. Geisleden was included in the Soviet occupation zone after World War II, before joining the district of Erfurt in East Germany until 1990, when the eastern and western parts of Germany merged into a single country once again.

<text>Francis Alexander Anglin (April 2, 1865 – March 2, 1933) was the seventh Chief Justice of Canada from 1924 until 1933.

Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, one of nine children of Timothy Anglin, federal politician and Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, and elder brother to the renowned stage actress, Margaret Anglin. He was educated at St. Mary&#x27;s College, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Ottawa in 1887. Anglin studied law at the Law Society of Upper Canada (which in those days taught law) and was called to the bar in 1888, establishing a practice in Toronto. In 1896 he became Clerk of the Surrogate Court of Ontario, and King&#x27;s Counsel in 1902.

He was appointed to the Exchequer Division of the High Court of Justice of Ontario in 1904 and, thanks to a nomination from the Laurier government, to the Supreme Court of Canada on February 23, 1909, becoming Chief Justice in 1924 thanks to a nomination by the first Mackenzie King government, and serving until his retirement, two days before his death, in 1933.

He was author of &quot;Trustees&#x27; Limitations and Other Relief&quot; (Toronto 1910) and penned the &quot;Ontario&quot; entry for the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;.

<text>Änglagård is a Swedish progressive rock band, with influences including King Crimson, Genesis, Gentle Giant, Trettioåriga Kriget, Schicke Führs Fröhling, and Van der Graaf Generator. The band was established in 1991 by Tord Lindman (guitars and vocals) and Johan Högberg (bass guitar), and broke up in 1994. They briefly reformed in 2002–2003, and have been active again since 2009. They combine vintage analog sounds with a modern classical approach to composing and arranging. To date, they have released three studio albums and three live recordings to great acclaim from the progressive rock community.

== History ==
&quot;Hybris&quot;, the debut release, and the follow-on instrumental &quot;Epilog&quot; of 1994, were both voted &quot;album of the year&quot; in polls of progressive rock fans. In 2003 the band briefly reformed (without founding member Lindman), performing new material at several performances, including NEARfest 2003; during this time they débuted the songs that ultimately became &quot;Sorgmantel&quot; and &quot;Längtans klocka&quot; on their third album, though at this point they were untitled. In 2009 Mattias Olsson confirmed that the band had been recording new material on his MySpace blog, though no release date for the new material was announced. In July 2012, Änglagård&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Viljans Öga&quot;, was released.

On October 4, 2012 it was announced on the band&#x27;s official website that Tord Lindman was back in the band. Also, there were further changes in the line-up with new recruits Erik Hammarström (drums, percussion) and Linus Kåse (keyboards, saxophone). Hammarström is a former member of The Flower Kings. Hammarström and Kåse are also members of Swedish progressive rock band Brighteye Brison. The debut performance with this line-up took place in the venue Bryggarsalen in Stockholm on February 23, 2013. The band continued to tour during the following months. They were the opening act for three nights in a row (March 15—17) with The Crimson ProjeKct at Club Citta&#x27; in Kawasaki, Japan. &quot;Prog på Svenska: Live in Japan&quot; was recorded at these shows and released in 2014. In April, they performed at the Baja Prog festival in Mexico and the Prog-Résiste Convention in Belgium. On July 14, 2013 Änglagård played at Night of the Prog in Loreley, Germany with former Flower Kings member Jaime Salazar temporarily substituting on drums. Additional live dates in 2013 were Ino-Rock, Poland (August 31) and Melloboat, Sweden/Latvia (September 6).

In 2014, the band only played four shows: in Netherlands (April 11), Mexico (May 23), U.K. (August 3) and Italy (September 6). In October 2014, the band announced the return of guitarist Jonad Engdegård. In 2015 the band had their busiest year of the millennium, with three shows in February (Italy and Norway), followed by an eight-date April tour across Europe, and finishing with two November dates in Japan and four in the USA. The February 21, 2015 show in Sandvika, Norway was filmed and recorded and released in 2017 as &quot;Änglagård Live: Made in Norway&quot;. In 2017, the band played seven shows, starting with two February shows on the &quot;Cruise to the Edge&quot; festival (sailing from Tampa, FL), then five spring shows in Sweden, Spain, Canada and the USA (at &quot;Rites of Spring&quot; festival).

In September 2022, original drummer Matthais Olsson posted on Facebook that he had met with Jonas Engdegård and Johan Brand, and that they had been rehearsing &quot;Hybris&quot; during its 30th anniversary year). In December 2022, the band announced they would be playing dates in 2023, focusing on the entire debut album, with a new lineup consisting of Olsson, Brand, and Engdegård, plus two &quot;newcomers&quot; Oskar Forsberg and Staffan Lindroth. As of mid-January 2023, two dates have been confirmed: June 10 at Minnuendo in Spain and November 3 at the Haugaland Prog &amp; Rock Festival in Norway.

<text>Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital (, ) is a charitable hospital in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. It is part of the AP-HP Sorbonne University Hospital Group and a teaching hospital of Sorbonne University.

==History==

The Salpêtrière was originally a gunpowder factory (saltpeter being a constituent of gunpowder), but in 1656 at the direction of Louis XIV, it was converted into a &quot;hospice&quot; for the poor women of Paris as part of the General Hospital of Paris. This main hospice was for women who were learning disabled, mentally ill, or epileptic, as well as poor. In 1657 it was incorporated with the hospice of the Pitié designed specifically for beggars&#x27; children and orphans. Sheets for hospice and military clothing were produced there by the children. Between 1663 and 1673, 240 of the women at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospice were sent on a mission to populate the Americas and help build New France. They were in the total number of 768 young women recruited during the ten-year period to become known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Daughters&quot;. The Salpêtrière was much admired for the architectural designs of Libéral Bruant with the support of Louis Le Vau. Its conversion was completed in 1669. In 1684 a women&#x27;s prison was added to the site with a total capacity of 300 convicted prostitutes. It provided wretched living conditions for its inmates. 
On the eve of the Revolution, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospice had become the world&#x27;s largest hospice, with a capacity of 10,000 &quot;patients&quot; and over 300 prisoners. Until the French Revolution, the Salpêtrière had no medical function: the sick were sent to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital.

During the September massacres of 1792, the Salpêtrière was stormed on the nights of September 3/4 by a mob from the impoverished working-class district of the Faubourg Saint-Marcel, with the avowed intention of releasing the detained prisoners: 134 of the prostitutes were released; twenty-five madwomen were less fortunate and were dragged, some still in their chains, into the streets and murdered.

At the very end of the 18th century, the early humanitarian reforms in the treatment of the mentally ill were initiated here by Philippe Pinel (1745–1826), friend of the &quot;Encyclopédistes&quot;. The iconic image of Pinel as the liberator of the insane was created in 1876 by Tony Robert-Fleury and Pinel&#x27;s sculptural monument stands before the main entrance in Place Marie-Curie, Boulevard de L&#x27;Hôpital. Pinel was the chief physician of the Salpêtrière by 1794, in charge of a 200-bed infirmary which housed a tiny proportion of the huge indigent female population. He was succeeded by his assistant Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol (1772–1840) who, from 1817, delivered the first systematic lectures on psychiatry in France and was the chief architect of the lunacy legislation of 30 June 1838. Esquirol was followed by Étienne Pariset; and from 1831 till 1867 the &quot;chef d&#x27;hospice&quot; was Jean-Pierre Falret (1794–1870) who contributed much to our understanding of bipolar disorder and folie à deux.

A regular visitor to the Salpêtrière from 1842 till his death more than thirty years later was Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne de Boulogne (1806–1875). From humble provincial origins, a long line of seafarers from Boulogne, Duchenne became one of the outstanding medical scientists of the nineteenth century. Though he never held a senior appointment in the hospital, Duchenne nevertheless made meticulous observations on neurological patients, employing a wide range of innovative diagnostic techniques. Duchenne&#x27;s clinical science stood at the technical junction of electricity, photography and psychology, as recorded in his much admired &quot;De l&#x27;électrisation localisée&quot; with its associated atlas &quot;Album de photographies pathologiques&quot; (1855, 1862). His name is commemorated in the myopathies which he described, as well as in his 1862 masterpiece, the &quot;Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine&quot;, much consulted by Charles Darwin in the preparation of his &quot;Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; (1872). Duchenne&#x27;s last major work (published in 1867) was a study of animal locomotion. He was never elected to the Academy of Sciences.

Later, when Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) took over the department, the Salpêtrière became celebrated as a neuropsychiatric teaching facility, represented on canvas in 1887 by &quot;A Clinical Lesson at the Salpêtrière&quot; by André Brouillet. In his lectures and demonstrations, the &quot;leçons du mardi&quot;, Charcot systematized the neurological examination, did much to map out the territory of modern clinical neurology and, in a personal enthusiasm, explored its interface with psychological distress as represented in hysteria. Although Charcot insisted that hysteria could be a male disorder (&quot;traumatic hysteria&quot;), he is popularly remembered for his demonstrations with Louise Augustine Gleizes and Marie Wittman. Charcot had also absorbed much from Duchenne (to whom he often referred as &quot;mon maître, Duchenne&quot;) and his teaching activities on the Salpêtrière&#x27;s wards helped to elucidate the natural history of many diseases including neurosyphilis, epilepsy, and stroke. In his discussion of &quot;paralysis agitans&quot;, Charcot drew attention to the 1817 description by James Parkinson, and suggested it be renamed Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 1882, with Charcot&#x27;s encouragement, Albert Londe created a photographic department in the Salpêtriėre, producing, in collaboration with Georges Gilles de la Tourette, the &quot;Nouvelle Iconographie de la Salpêtrière&quot; of 1888.

Students came from across the world to witness Charcot&#x27;s clinical demonstrations: among them – in 1885 – was the 29-year old Sigmund Freud who translated Charcot&#x27;s lectures into German and whose deconstruction of the lectures on hysteria formed the foundations of psychoanalysis. The first English translations of Charcot&#x27;s &quot;Clinical Lectures&quot; (1877, 1881) were published by the Irish physician and politician George Sigerson. Public health physician and advocate of breastfeeding Truby King traveled from New Zealand to witness Charcot, reporting his clinical demonstrations seminal. A rather negative portrait of Charcot&#x27;s clinical style emerges in the 1929 autobiographical memoir – &quot;The Story of San Michele&quot; – by the Swedish physician Axel Munthe, whose early idolatry of Charcot gave way to a kind of obsessive antagonism.

The Hôpital de la Pitié, founded about 1612, was moved next to the Salpêtrière in 1911 and fused with it in 1964 to form the Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière. The Pitié-Salpêtrière is now a general teaching hospital with departments focusing on most major medical specialties.

Numerous personalities have been treated at the Salpêtrière, including Michael Schumacher, Ronaldo, Prince Rainier of Monaco, Alain Delon, Gérard Depardieu, and Valérie Trierweiler. Former president Jacques Chirac had a pacemaker fitted at the Salpêtrière in 2008. Celebrities have also died at the Pitié-Salpêtrière, including the singer Josephine Baker in 1975, following a cerebral haemorrhage; philosopher Michel Foucault in 1984 due to AIDS-related complications; Diana, Princess of Wales following a car crash in 1997; and French bicycle racer Laurent Fignon in 2010, from the metastatic spread of lung cancer (which coincidentally happened exactly thirteen years after Diana’s death in the same hospital).

The Brain and Spine Institute, now called Institut du Cerveau (ICM) or the Paris Brain Institute, has been located in the hospital since it was established in September 2010.

==Buildings==

===Hospital Chapel===
&quot;Chapelle de la Salpêtrière&quot; (Hospital Chapel), at n° 47 Boulevard de l&#x27;Hôpital is one of the masterpieces of Libéral Bruant, architect of Les Invalides. It was built around 1675, on the model of a Greek cross and has four central chapels each capable of holding a congregation of some 1,000 people. Its central octagonal cupola is illuminated by picture windows in circular arcs.

===Philippe Pinel monument===
In the &quot;place&quot; in front of the main entrance to the hospital, there is a large bronze monument to Philippe Pinel, who was chief physician of the Hospice from 1795 to his death in 1826. The Salpêtrière was, at the time, like a large village, with seven thousand elderly indigent and ailing women, an entrenched bureaucracy, a teeming market and huge infirmaries. Pinel created an inoculation clinic in his service at the Salpêtrière in 1799 and the first vaccination in Paris was given there in April 1800.

<text>Pedro Machado Abrunhosa (born 20 December 1960) is a Portuguese singer, songwriter, musician and composer. Trained in jazz music, Abrunhosa started his career in the 1980s playing in jazz bands and teaching in music and art schools in Porto. He is a co-founder of the Jazz School of Porto.

In 1994 Abrunhosa launched a solo career in pop music with his debut album &quot;Viagens&quot;. This album made Abrunhosa the fastest-selling artist in Portuguese record-industry history at the time, reached number-one in the Portuguese album charts and sold over 140,000 copies. His second album &quot;Tempo&quot; (1996) continued the success and confirmed Abrunhosa&#x27;s status as a major artist in the Portuguese music industry. Six of his eight studio albums have reached number-one in the Portuguese album charts. 
Aside from his music, he is known for always wearing sunglasses in public. Abrunhosa also played himself in the 1999 Manoel de Oliveira film &quot;The Letter&quot;. He is a board member of the Portuguese Authors Society.

==Early life==
Abrunhosa was born in Porto, Portugal. After studying at the Ruvina Music School, in 1972 he began his musical studies at the Music School of Porto, under the guidance of Professors Álvaro Salazar and Jorge Peixinho, in the subjects of Analysis, Composition, and History of Music, having already initiated his studies in the double bass. (He has often been approached by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation to attend and participate in the Meetings of Contemporary Music in that same institution.)

Once admitted into the &quot;Conservatório de Música do Porto&quot;, he studied musical composition under the direction of Professor Cândido Lima. At that time, he was invited to take part in the Madrid Contemporary Music Group, under the direction of Spanish composer Enrique X. Macias. This afforded him the opportunity to take part in a series of shows performed in Portugal and Spain. In 1981, he received a diploma for the Courses of Musical Pedagogy from Belgian Professor Jos Wuytack.

==Career==

=== 1984–1994: Early career ===
In 1984, he went to Madrid to study with double-bass player Todd Coolman and with musicians Joe Hunt, Wallace Rooney, Gerry Niewood and Steve Brown. In that same year, he finished the General Course of Composition in the &quot;Conservatório de Música do Porto&quot; and started studying double-bass with Alejandro Erlich Oliva.

In 1985, returning to Spain, he took part in the International Jazz Seminar, and worked again with Todd Coolman, Billy Hart, Bill Dobbins, David Schnitter, Jack Walrath and Steve Brown. In that same year, together with Spanish guitar player Joaquin Iglesias, he founded the quartet &quot;Banda de Bolso&quot;.

In 1986, he returned to Spain to participate in the third International Jazz Seminar in Seville where he played with Bob Moses, Chip Jackson, Brad Hartfield, Hoku Kim and Stan Strickland. In Portugal, later that year, he participated in the Seminars of Direction and Interpretation of the Big Band. He was chosen as the double-bass player of the newly formed orchestra. He also participated in two other Jazz Seminars with Danish saxophonist John Tchicai and bassist Peter Danstrup and the American musicians Paul Motian, Bill Frisell, and Joe Lovano.

In 1987, he worked with David Liebman, Billy Hart, Ron McClure and Richard Beirach in Barcelona. For one year, he taught double-bass at the Jazz School of Hot-Club in Lisbon. He also directed and produced the program &quot;Até Jazz&quot; in the &quot;Rádio Clube do Porto&quot;. Later on, he joined Boulou Ferré, Ramon Cardo, Frankie Rose, Vicent Penasse and Tommy Halferty and extensively toured Portugal and throughout Europe. Additionally, he joined the Teacher&#x27;s Quartet of Hot-Club of Portugal and Carlos Martin&#x27;s Quartet.

He composed and recorded the music for the films &quot;Amour en Latin&quot;, directed by Serge Abramovic, &quot;Adão e Eva&quot; directed by Joaquim Leitão, and &quot;Novo Mundo&quot;. He was awarded Best Soundtrack at the Madrid Film Festival for the latter. He also composed the music for the theatrical pieces &quot;Possessos de Amor&quot;, &quot;A Teia&quot;, and &quot;O Aniversário da Infanta&quot; (Oscar Wilde). He composed the soundtrack to the video &quot;150 Anos do Bonfim&quot;.

He co-founded the Jazz School of Porto, where he taught Harmony, Auditive Training and Group Music, during three years. He assembled and has conducted the orchestra of the Jazz School of Porto, concomitantly, composing most of its arrangements.

He was a teacher at the Higher Arts School of Porto (Cine-Video area), where lectured on the Formation and Analysis of the Soundtrack and at the Caius Music School on Group Music and Musical Production.

He formed and directed the Cool Jazz Orchestra, a musical group essentially devoted to Rhythm &amp; Blues. After three years of intense work it became &quot;Pedro Abrunhosa e a Máquina do Som&quot;, performing original pieces, all of which were composed by Pedro Abrunhosa.

=== 1994–1995: &quot;Viagens&quot; and mainstream success ===

In 1994, Abrunhosa recorded his debut studio album &quot;Viagens&quot; with his new band Bandemónio, that included several of his former students. Released by PolyGram, &quot;Viagens&quot; had the participation of Maceo Parker - the sax player that usually accompanied James Brown. The album was a success, achieving triple platinum with the sale of 140,000 copies in Portugal.

With &quot;Viagens&quot;, Abrunhosa became &quot;the fastest-selling artist in Portuguese record-industry history&quot;; between October 1994 and January 1995, he performed in over 120 concerts across Portugal, with the estimated total audience surpassing 200,000. The tracks &quot;Não Posso Mais&quot; and &quot;Socorro&quot; were hits at dance clubs in the country, and &quot;Billboard&quot; considered Abrunhosa&#x27;s sudden popularity a &quot;music revolution&quot; in a country where &quot;music with jazzy foundations&quot; was met with some reluctance. He was named best act in 1994 by major publications such as &quot;Blitz&quot;, &quot;Público&quot; and &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; and in 2009 &quot;Viagens&quot; was considered by &quot;Blitz&quot; as the best Portuguese album of the 90s.

Under the band name &quot;Pedro Abrunhosa e os Bandemónio&quot;, the album &quot;F&quot; was released. A book illustrating the adventures and trips of the group was also released. The book enjoyed the collaboration of two prestigious individuals in the literary and photographic worlds, respectively: Nuno Galopim and Kenton Thatcher.

In 1995, Abrunhosa was heavily involved in the protests against the sale of one of the most emblematic concert venues in Portugal, Coliseu do Porto, to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. The musician chained himself to the building, using his significant popularity to bring public awareness to the eminent sale, that would not be completed.

=== 1996–1998: &quot;Tempo&quot; ===
In September 1996, Abrunhosa went to Memphis and Minneapolis where he finished the final phase of mixing and mastering of his second album &quot;Tempo&quot;. The album was recorded in Porto, Lisbon, Memphis, and Minneapolis. The final mixing process, as well as a substantial portion of the rhythm and voice recording were supervised by Tom Tucker, technical director of Paisley Park and chief engineer on Prince&#x27;s latest albums.

Supported by his label – PolyGram – he invited The New Power Generation Horns to collaborate on this album, formed by Kathy Jensen, Kenni Holmen, Michael Nelson, David Jensen, Steve Strand, Ricky Peterson and Paul Peterson (these last two being Prince&#x27;s keyboard player and bassist). He also collaborated with Ozzie Melendez (Tower of Power), Carlos do Carmo, Opus Ensemble, and Rui Veloso. &quot;Tempo&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;), was launched at midnight on November 11, 1996. After its first week on the shelves, the album went double platinum with more than 200,000 copies sold in Portugal.

He started his new tour &quot;Tempo Tour 97/98&quot;, with concerts across Portugal, as well as in France, Canada, Switzerland, Brazil, and the United States.
In order to further the internationalization of his work, he went to Madrid, Paris, and London to record some of &quot;Tempo&quot; tracks in Spanish, French, and English.

In May of that same year, he returned to London, to film the video &quot;No Way&quot;, with the collaboration of Tony Vanden Ende.

He composed the music and authored the script for the musical &quot;O Rapaz de Papel&quot; (&quot;The Paper Boy&quot;), presented to the public in March 1998, integrated into &quot;O Festival dos Cem Dias&quot; (The Hundred Day Festival&quot;) and preceding the opening of Expo 98.

He produced the solo debut album by vocalist Diana Basto, &quot;Amanhecer&quot; (&quot;Dawn&quot;), released by PolyGram. He was responsible for the lyrics and music. It was recorded together with Tom Tucker, and was mixed and mastered in Minneapolis and Los Angeles.

He was invited by Caetano Veloso to integrate his show in Expo 98 that has, so far, broken all the booking-office records.

Invited by Expo 98, he performed his show at the Sony Plaza in September. It was the only performance from Portugal&#x27;s Expo 98 which was broadcast all over the world.

He was later invited to participate in the Manuel de Oliveira film, &quot;La Lettre&quot; (&quot;The Letter&quot;), together with Chiara Mastroianni and Françoise Fabian, where he played the leading role. The film was awarded the Prix du Jury in the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.

He produced his third album of originals &quot;Silence&quot;, finished in November 1999, which includes the presence of Caetano Veloso&#x27;s percussionists, Nina Miranda (of Smoke City) and the strings section usually used by Radiohead and dEUS.

He won four Blitz Awards: Record of the Year, Artist of the Year, Best Song, and Best Group. A Bordalo, an award given by the press; a Globo de Ouro (&quot;Golden Globe&quot;) awarded for the song “Se Eu Fosse Um Dia O Teu Olhar”; and five Nova Era Radio awards, given by radio stations and institutions.

=== 1999–present ===
In 1999, he gave a number of lectures throughout Portugal, mostly in libraries, schools, and universities, on topics related to artistic production and creation, literature, music and cinema. Some of lectures were published.

In 2002, he performed two shows at the Cultural Center of Belém, after a one-year hiatus. “Intimidade” was received favorably by the critics and public alike. The show, backed by IPAE, toured Portugal and proved to be an artistic and box-office success.

His album &quot;Momento&quot; (2002) was written and composed solely by him. It has the participation of the Helicon String Quartet. Manoel de Oliveira, the famous Portuguese director, directed the short film &quot;Momento&quot;, as a video for the first single and title track off the album.

In Portugal, &quot;Momento&quot; reached double platinum, and was the most played album on radio. Pedro Abrunhosa released the album in Brazil through Universal, with the participation of local artists such as Zélia Duncan, Lenine, Sandra de Sá, and Adriana Calcanhoto. (His songs are performed in Brazil by a number of artists such as Elba Ramalho, Zeca Baleiro, Sandra Sá, and Rio Soul or Syang, among others.)

His first DVD, &quot;Intimidade&quot; went double platinum in just 2 weeks.

He is a standing board member of the Portuguese Authors Society.

==Artistry==
===Public persona===
Abrunhosa is known for always wearing sunglasses in public. He was an influent personality in Portugal during the 90s, with a &quot;strong image&quot; and a &quot;coherent and articulate speech&quot;.

<text>Clytie (; ) or Clytia (; ) is a water nymph, daughter of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys in Greek mythology. She is thus one of the 3,000 Oceanid nymphs, and sister to the 3,000 river-gods.

According to the myth, Clytie loved the sun-god Helios in vain, but he left her for another woman, the princess Leucothoe, under the influence of Aphrodite, the goddess of love. In anger and bitterness, she revealed their affair to the girl&#x27;s father, indirectly causing her doom as the king buried her alive. This failed to win Helios back to her, and she was left lovingly staring at him from the ground; eventually she turned into a heliotrope, a violet flower that gazes at the Sun each day in its diurnal journey.

Clytie&#x27;s story is mostly known from and fully preserved in Ovid&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, though other brief accounts and references to her from other authors survive as well.

== Etymology ==
Her name, spelled both &quot;Klytie&quot; and &quot;Klytia&quot; (, ), is derived from the ancient Greek adjective (&#x27;), meaning &quot;glorious&quot; or &quot;renowned&quot;. That word itself derives from the verb &#x27;, meaning &#x27;to hear, to understand&#x27;, ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, which means &#x27;to hear&#x27;.

== Family ==
Although Ovid does not mention Clytie&#x27;s parentage or homeland (if not Babylon), Hesiod includes her name in his list of the 3,000 Oceanids, daughters of the water deities Oceanus and Tethys, two of the original Titans. Hyginus also gives her the same parentage. Clytie is thus also sister to the 3,000 river-gods. Neither Hesiod nor Hyginus mention the myth concerning Helios, but their figure seems to be identical to Ovid&#x27;s.

In another narrative that takes place in Boeotia, Clytie is identified as Leucothoe&#x27;s own sister, and daughter of King Orchomenus, although not by name.

== Mythology ==
=== Ovid ===
Ovid&#x27;s account of the story is the fullest and most detailed of the surviving ones. According to him, Clytie was a lover of the god of the sun Helios, until Aphrodite made him fall in love with a Persian mortal princess called Leucothoe, in revenge for him informing her husband Hephaestus of her illicit affair with his brother Ares, the god of war. Helios then ceased to care for her, as well as all the other goddesses and nymphs he had loved before, like Rhodos, Perse and Clymene. He abandoned her and preferred to spend his days admiring the princess Leucothoe. Though scorned and deserted, she still sought out his love and warmth. Angered by his treatment of her, and still missing him, she informed Leucothoe&#x27;s strict father, King Orchamus, about the affair. Since Helios had defiled Leucothoe, Orchamus had her put to death by burial alive in the sands despite the girl&#x27;s protest and proclaiming of her innocence. Helios arrived too late to save the girl, but he did make sure to turn her into a frankincense tree by pouring nectar over her dead body, so that she would still breathe air (in a certain fashion). Ovid seems to think that Helios bears some responsibility over Clytie&#x27;s excessive jealousy because he writes that Helios&#x27;s passion was never &quot;moderate&quot; when he loved her.

Clytie intended to win Helios back by taking away his new love, but her plan backfired on her, and her actions only hardened his heart against her. Thereafter Helios avoided her altogether, never going back to her. In despair, she stripped herself and sat naked, accepting neither food nor drink, for nine days on the rocks, staring at the Sun and mourning his departure, but he never looked back at her. After nine days she was eventually transformed into a purple flower, the heliotrope (meaning &quot;sun-turning&quot;). Also known as the turnsole, it is known for growing on sunny, rocky hillsides. The flower turns its head always to look longingly at Helios the Sun as he passes through the sky in his solar chariot, even though he no longer cares for her, her form much changed, her love for him unchanged.

=== Variations ===
The episode is most fully told by Roman poet Ovid in his first-century AD poem &quot;the Metamorphoses&quot;; Ovid&#x27;s version is the only full surviving narrative of this story, but he must had had a Greek original source, for the myth&#x27;s origins and plot lie in the etymology of the flower&#x27;s Greek name. According to Lactantius Placidus, he got this myth from seventh or sixth century BC Greek author Hesiod. Some scholars however doubt this particular attribution to Hesiod. Like Ovid, Lactantius does not explain how Clytie knew about Helios and Leucothoe, or how Helios knew it was Clytie who had informed Orchamus. It is possible that originally the stories of Leucothoe and Clytie were two distinct ones before they were combined along with a third story, that of Ares and Aphrodite&#x27;s affair being discovered by Helios who then informed Hephaestus, into a single one either by Ovid or Ovid&#x27;s source.

One of the ancient paradoxographers identifies the girl who betrayed the secret as Leucothoe&#x27;s sister instead, and their father&#x27;s name as Orchomenus, but gives her neither a name nor a motivation behind her actions; the mother of the two girls similarly goes unnamed (Eurynome in Ovid), perhaps as a consequence of anonymous&#x27; abridged narrative. Orchomenus is also the name of a town in Boeotia, implying that this version of the story took place there rather than Persia. Pliny the Elder wrote that:

I have spoken more than once of the marvel of heliotropium, which turns round with the sun even on a cloudy day, so great a love it has for that, luminary. At night it closes its blue flower as though it mourned.

Edith Hamilton notes that Clytie&#x27;s case is unique in Greek mythology, as instead of the typical lovesick god being in love with an unwilling maiden, it is a maiden who is in love with an unwilling god.

== Culture ==
Similar to the story of Daphne used as an explanation for the plant&#x27;s prominence in worship, Clytie&#x27; story might have been used for similar purposes in connecting the flower she turned into, the heliotrope, to Helios.

An ancient scholiast wrote that the heliotropium that Clytie was turned into was the first preservation of the love for the god.

== Modern interpretations ==
=== Identity of the flower ===
Modern traditions substitute the purple turnsole with a yellow sunflower, which according to (incorrect) folk wisdom turns in the direction of the sun. The original French form &quot;tournesol&quot; primarily refers to sunflower, while the English &quot;turnsole&quot; is primarily used for heliotrope. Sunflowers however are native to North America, and were not found in antiquity in either Greece or Italy, making it impossible for ancient Greek and Roman authors to have included them in their etiological myths, as sunflowers were not part of their native flora and they would have not known about them and their sun-turning properties.

It has also been noted that the heliotropium itself poses some difficulties for identification with Clytie&#x27;s flower; heliotropium arborescens, which is the vivid purple variant, is not native to Europe either, instead coming from the Americas just like the aforementioned sunflower. Native variants of heliotropium or other flowers called &quot;heliotrope&quot; are also the wrong colour, either white (heliotropium supinum) or yellow (vilossum), when Ovid described it as &quot;like a violet&quot; and Pliny &quot;blue&quot;. Both however lived in the post-Hellenistic period after the conquests of Alexander the Great, and could have been aware of the heliotropium indicum, a variant that can have a purplish or bluish corolla. Moreover, even heliotropium europaeum, a variant native in Europe which is normally white in colour, can have pale lilac flowers.

=== Identity of the god ===
Much like with Phaethon, another ancient myth featuring Helios, some modern retellings connect Clytie and her story to Apollo, the god of light, but the myth as attested in classical sources does not actually concern him; Ovid identifies twice the god Clytie fell in love with as &quot;Hyperione natus/e&quot; (the son of Hyperion), and like other Roman authors does not conflate in his poem the two gods, who remain distinct in myth. Clytie&#x27;s lover whom she was jilted by is also connected to the story of Phaethon, as the boy&#x27;s father, a distinctly solar but non-Apolline figure, who in turn is not a sun god or given any solar characteristics as far as Ovid is concerned. Joseph Fontenrose argued that despite Ovid&#x27;s works being largely responsible for the prevalence of the two gods being the same one in post-classical times, he himself did not actually identify them in either the story of Phaethon or the story of Leucothoe and Clytie.

== Art ==
=== Bust (Townley collection) ===
One sculpture of Clytie, found in the collection of Charles Townley, might be either a Roman work, or an eighteenth century &quot;fake&quot;.

The bust was created between 40 and 50 AD. Townley acquired it from the family of the principe Laurenzano in Naples during his extended second Grand Tour of Italy (1771–1774); the Laurenzano insisted it had been found locally. It remained a favorite both with him (it figures prominently in Johann Zoffany&#x27;s iconic painting of Townley&#x27;s library (&quot;illustration, right&quot;), was one of three ancient marbles Townley had reproduced on his visiting card, and was apocryphally the one which he wished he could carry with him when his house was torched in the Gordon Riots – apocryphal since the bust is in fact far too heavy for that) and with the public (Joseph Nollekens is said to have always had a marble copy of it in stock for his customers to purchase, and in the late 19th century Parian ware copies were all the rage.

The identity of the subject, a woman emerging from a calyx of leaves, was much discussed among the antiquaries in Townley&#x27;s circle. At first referred to as Agrippina, and later called by Townley Isis in a lotus flower, it is now accepted as Clytie. Some modern scholars even claim the bust is of eighteenth century date, though most now think it is an ancient work showing Antonia Minor or a contemporaneous Roman lady in the guise of Ariadne.

=== Bust (George Frederick Watts) ===
Another famous bust of Clytie was by George Frederick Watts. Instead of Townley&#x27;s serene Clytie, Watts&#x27;s is straining, looking round at the sun.

=== Literature ===
Clytie is briefly alluded to in Thomas Hood&#x27;s poem &quot;Flowers&quot;, in the lines &quot;I will not have the mad Clytie,/Whose head is turned by the sun;&quot;. William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;Ah! Sun-flower&quot; has been suggested to allude to the myth of Clytie.

The sunflower (which was not Clytie&#x27;s original flower) ever since her myth, has &quot;been an emblem of the faithful subject&quot;, in three or four ways: the &quot;image of a soul devoted to the god or God, originally a Platonic concept&quot;, as &quot;an image of the Virgin devoted to Christ&quot;; or &quot;an image - in the strictly Ovidian sense - of the lover devoted to the beloved&quot;. Northrop Frye claimed that Clytie&#x27;s metamorphosis tale is at the &#x27;core&#x27; of the poem.

<text>The British Rail Class 423 (4 VEP), electric multiple unit passenger trains were mostly built by British Rail (BR) at York Works from 1967 to 1974, although the MBSOs and TSOs of the first 20, 7701-7720, were built at Derby Works. They have manually opening doors next to every seating row and were the last coaching stock built in this pattern for BR. They were mostly found working outer-suburban services in South London and rural services in Kent, Sussex and Hampshire, up to 2005 when they were finally replaced by Electrostar and Desiro units. The fleet had a working life of 38 years.

==Description==
===Standard units===
Ordered in 1965, 194 standard four-car 4 VEP units were built between 1967 and 1974, numbered 7701-7894; subsequently becoming class 423 under TOPS. They were subsequently renumbered in the 1980s into the 30xx and 31xx series in order to make numbers TOPS compliant. Between 1988 and 1995 the units were internally facelifted. The work involved fitting fluorescent lighting and public address equipment, and also rebuilding the MBS (motor brake second) vehicles with an additional two bays of seating in space formerly used for luggage. On refurbishment only the first 20 units were renumbered in order, in the 34xx series. All other units were renumbered from 3421 onwards, in the order they were refurbished. All units ended up swapping motor vehicles on refurbishment - the additional work on these cars made the work take longer than that carried out on trailer vehicles.

===8 VAB unit===
In 1968, due to a shortage of suitable stock for the Bournemouth electrification scheme, BR formed an eight-carriage 8 VAB unit, no. 8001. The unit was formed of carriages from three standard sets, nos. 7739/41/42, plus a conventional locomotive-hauled buffet carriage. Three MBSOs were required within the make-up as the standard &#x27;TRB&#x27; was not through-wired for traction power distribution. In view of this the two MBSOs in the five-car portion had collector shoes fitted to one bogie on each. The unit worked on occasions with a 4TC; this usually had a Class 33 attached to provide ETH and train lighting in the TC unit, as the 8 VAB was not fitted with ETH jumper cables on the unit ends. Its normal running formation was with another 4 VEP to make a 12-car set. The &#x27;TRB&#x27; vehicle retained its gas-powered appliances so, unlike 4 REP buffet cars, was able to provide hot food and beverages while on diversions away from third-rail areas. Adjacent MBSO 62203 had most of its doors locked out of use and tables fitted across them for the service of meals on a 2-and-2 basis (across seats intended for five persons normally); this vehicle also had most of its luggage racks removed. The unit was later reclassified as Class 480 following the introduction of TOPS.

The numbering of individual vehicles are shown in the table below.
The unit was disbanded in 1974, following deliveries of 4 REP stock, but one of the original units, no. 7739, was not reformed, as spare vehicles from the unit had replaced crash-damaged VEP vehicles in the meantime.

===4 VEG units===
In 1978 12 units, nos. 7788-7799, were fitted with extra luggage racks by removing the squabs and cushions from certain seats and reclassified as Class 427 4 VEG units. The units were renumbered into the range 7901-7912 in the same sequence. These units were dedicated to the Gatwick Express services from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport. Externally these units were marked by an orange/yellow (dayglo) coloured band at cantrail level with lettering &#x27;London-Gatwick express service&#x27;. They were used on Victoria to Bognor Regis services attached at the rear from Victoria and detached at Gatwick Airport so that airline passengers did not have to rush to get off the train. The unit then attached to the front of an Up Bognor Regis service back to Victoria.

In 1984 they were replaced on this service by Class 73 electro-diesel locomotives operating in push-pull with Class 488 coaching sets and Class 489 luggage vans. The twelve units were then converted back to standard sets, and regained their original unit numbers.

===Vehicle numbering===
The numbering of individual vehicles and details of when units were built are shown in the table below.
==Final operations==
Following the privatisation of British Rail the three southern train operators all inherited large fleets of 4 VEP units. A franchise commitment of all operators was to replace all of the units, along with all other Mark 1 rolling stock, by the end of 2005, as the units did not meet modern health and safety requirements. The fleet of each franchise is described below.

===South Eastern Trains===
South Eastern Trains operated the largest fleet of 4 VEP units. The franchise was originally operated as Connex South Eastern, which lost the franchise in 2003. The fleet contained several unusual units, including no. 3473, which contained a driving trailer with the compartments removed, and no. 3582, which contained former 4TC driving trailer 76275.

Many units survived into 2005 because of the closure of the Folkestone—Dover section of railway for tunnel refurbishment. This ended in September 2005. The final passenger service was operated on 7 October 2005, using units 3565, 3545 and 3568.

All the South Eastern Trains 4 VEP units are withdrawn. One driving trailer from unit 3568, and another from unit 3545, have been claimed by the National Railway Museum, and the former 4TC driving trailer from unit 3582 have been preserved.

===South Central/Southern===
The Network SouthCentral division inherited a fleet of 50 standard Class 423/1 units. The franchise was originally won by Connex South Central, which soon applied its yellow and white livery to the fleet. However, following poor levels of service and financial mismanagement, the franchise was transferred to South Central Trains in 2000, which was later renamed as Southern in 2004. Only one unit, no. 3514, was ever repainted in Southern&#x27;s green livery.

In 1998-1999, whilst still under the control of Connex, 19 units were modified to operate inner suburban South London &quot;Metro&quot; services. The work involved removal of internal compartments and declassification of first class seating. The units were reclassified as Class 423/9, or 4 VOP, and renumbered in the range 3901-3919. Due to the lack of first class seating and toilets, these units were generally not used on long-distance services.

In 2003, with the general run-down of slam door trains, it was decided to reform some of the 4 VOP units by swapping one driving trailer with that from a standard unit, the standard units gaining the ex 4 VOP driving trailer. The new hybrid units were reclassified as Class 423/8 (or 4 VIP) and renumbered in the range 3813-3844. This was to give all units some first class seating, thus making diagramming of units easier. But in the event only eight units were reformed, namely nos. 3813/14/21/22/41-44.

By 2004 Southern had started to introduce Class 377 &quot;Electrostar&quot; units into service. Although first introduced in 2002, this did not initially affect the Class 423 as the older &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; Class 421 4 CIG units were withdrawn first, due to their age and lower seating capacity. However, as more new units entered traffic, the first Class 423 units were withdrawn. Units selected for withdrawal were usually those with high mileage or in poor condition. By mid-2005 only a handful of units remained in traffic. The final diagrammed passenger service out of London was the 17:17 London Victoria to Eastbourne and Seaford on 19 August 2005, formed of units 3486 and 3535, plus 4 CIG unit 1866. Six units were subsequently retained for emergency cover. Unit 3514 was used on the Sussex Slammer railtour on Saturday 19 November 2005. 

The following Saturday saw the final slam door trains on Southern, when units 3490, 3505 and 3535 formed the 09:19 Brighton to London Victoria and 11:06 London Victoria to Brighton services (via Lewes due to engineering works); this being the last scheduled mainline passenger service using southern-electric slam-door stock (the very last passenger being an off-duty HM Inspector of Railways). Following this trip the stock was withdrawn from service and initially put into Lover&#x27;s Walk depot before being moved (under its own power) to Battersea Stewart&#x27;s Lane Depot (road 12) from where it was hauled away at 12:26hrs on 3 January 2006 by a class 47 locomotive for scrapping.

One complete 4 VIP unit has been preserved, and two 4 VOP units remained in departmental use until March 2013.

===South West Trains===
South West Trains (SWT) inherited the second-largest number of units, with an initial fleet size of 62 units. The entire fleet was composed of standard Class 423/1 units. Later, a further four units (nos. 3809-3812) were transferred from Connex South Eastern. These were also standard units, but were numbered in the 38xx series to denote they were leased from Porterbrook rather than HSBC Rail.

SWT quickly repainted its fleet of units into a new livery, based on the previous Network SouthEast (NSE) livery, but with the addition of an orange stripe and the absence of the grey band. All but four units (3415 and 3809–3811) were repainted. These four units were deliberately retained in NSE livery, meaning that in the final days of slam-door trains they attained &quot;celebrity&quot; status among rail enthusiasts.

In 2001, SWT placed an order for 785 new carriages with Siemens to allow it to replace its fleet of slam-door trains, in accordance with its franchise commitment to do so by 2005. To assist Siemens in the design of third rail units, 4 VEP no. 3810 was transferred to a test site in Germany to undergo tests. Following its return to Britain, it became popularly known as the &quot;Great Escape&quot;.

South West Trains started to replace its slam-door fleet from early 2004, with the introduction of the first Class 444 and Class 450 Desiro units. Around this time, SWT repainted one unit, no. 3417, into its original BR Blue livery to commemorate the final months in traffic of the slam-door fleet. This unit was chosen because it was one of the last to receive major works attention, and therefore had the longest life-expectancy. It was named &quot;Gordon Pettitt&quot;, after a former manager of the Southern Region of British Railways.

In the final months of traffic several units, including the first-built, no. 3401, were reformed in order to allow the vehicles in the best condition to be retained in service. Withdrawals of units picked up pace, with several large culls of units, the last of which occurred in March 2005. Beyond this date, only a handful of units remained in traffic, namely nos. 3401/17/81 3516/20/36/76 and 3811. The final normal passenger service was operated on 26 May 2005 from London Waterloo to Bournemouth, using 4 VEP 3536 sandwiched between 4 CIG units 1396 and 1398. Following withdrawal, most units were rapidly towed away for scrap. The &quot;celebrity&quot; blue unit, no. 3417, has since been sold to the Bluebell Railway.

==Further use==
Following withdrawal from normal service, several vehicles have seen further use in departmental service.
*4 VOP units 3905 and 3918 were converted into tractor units. They were used to haul Class 375 units to and from Ashford Works.
*MBSO 62138 (ex-unit 3567) was renumbered to 977981 and was used as a motor coach in the Hitachi V-Train no. 960201 during third-rail testing. It has since been scrapped.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 26 January 1985, units 7754 and 7703 formed a train with 4 CIG unit 7395 which was halted by a landslip at Popham, Hampshire and was run into by Class 33 locomotive 33 104 due to the traincrew failing to protect the rear of the stranded train. Twelve people were injured. The Class 33 was written off.
*On 6 November 1985, unit 7724 collided with 4 CIG unit 7390 at Copyhold Junction, near , West Sussex due to a lack of braking and poor rail adhesion. Forty people were injured.
* On 12 December 1988, a train comprising units 3033, 3119 and 3005 formed the 07:18 - Waterloo service which was run into by the 06:14 - Waterloo service, formed of 4 REP unit 2003 and 4TC units 8027 and 8025 at . An empty stock working comprising units 3004 and 3425 running in the opposite direction on an adjacent line was struck by the derailed trains. Thirty-five people were killed, nearly 500 were injured.
* On 4 March 1989, unit 3441 is run into by a passenger train comprising 4 CIG units 1280 and 1295, which had overrun signals at , Surrey. Five people were killed and 88 were injured.
*On 1 August 1990, Class 119 diesel multiple unit L576 collided with a passenger train comprising 4 VEP units 3508 &amp; 3504, and 4 CIG unit 1304 at due to overrunning signals. Forty people were injured.

==Remaining unpreserved units/coaches==
==Preservation==

So far two complete units (highlighted in table below) and two individual driving trailers have been preserved. In addition the former 4TC driving vehicle from set 3582 has been preserved.

The more high-profile unit preserved is the former South West Trains (SWT) &quot;celebrity&quot; unit painted in BR blue livery with painted aluminium window frames, no. 3417. The unit was initially used on Wimbledon depot as a shunter, but with SWT needing to get it off its books it was sold to the Bluebell Railway for the nominal sum of £1. It was moved to Eastleigh Works for storage, after having been used initially as the centrepiece for the Bluebell in a ceremony at East Grinstead railway station to mark the commencement of work at the station site as part of the line&#x27;s work on the northern extension. The unit returned to East Grinstead for further use and storage in September 2010. In late April, the unit sustained minor damage to its shoegear as it was being driven from sidings at Clapham Junction Yard prior to movement under tow to the Swanage Railway. This resulted in the traction current being discharged in the yard whilst repairs were carried out. The unit was then moved back into the sidings and then dragged to Swanage the following day. The unit was for some time stabled in the open at Clapham Junction, having previously been stored in the shed at the yard. The unit was then moved to Ilford as part of a deal brokered by the unit&#x27;s support group for a full repaint. After the completion of this bodywork restoration, it was transferred to Strawberry Hill in South West London where the interior underwent long-term refurbishment by volunteers from the Southern Electric Traction Group. It was returned to the National Rolling Stock Library on 16th January 2024.

The second set, no. 3905, was turned into a tractor unit before being used for spares by the 5 BEL Trust to restore a 5 BEL set. It was donated for preservation and was stored at the Dartmoor Railway. In 2016 the termination of lease by Dartmoor Railway meant the unit would leave the railway and find a new home at the East Kent Railway in Sheperdswell. 

One other set, no. 3822, was briefly preserved until 2010 when it was scrapped. It was located at the Churnet Valley Railway and was partially restored. In 2008 half of the set was returned to as-built BR Blue and received internal repairs. The other half remained in &quot;as withdrawn&quot; Connex condition, and the set operated at several special events throughout that year.

There was an attempt to preserve unit 3810 (the unit that was briefly exported to Germany), but this failed and ultimately it was scrapped.

==Fleet details==

<text>Seth Harding (17 April 1734 – 20 November 1814) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Revolutionary War. In 1776, he was the captain of the &quot;Defence&quot;.

==Biography==
Seth Harding, also known as Hest was born in Eastham, Province of Massachusetts. He went to sea early in his life and commanded several merchant ships during the French and Indian War. He moved to Liverpool N.S., and briefly served in the 5th General Assembly of Nova Scotia, representing Liverpool Township from Oct. 12, 1773 to 1774.

At the beginning of the American Revolution, he offered his services to Connecticut and was commissioned commander of the state brig &quot;Defence&quot;. Harding captured many British ships while in command of this and two other vessels. In September 1778, Harding accepted a Continental Navy commission and took command of &quot;Confederacy&quot;. He cruised along the U.S. coast in company with &quot;Deane&quot; during 1779, taking three prizes and performing convoy duties.

He was ordered to take John Jay, newly appointed minister to Spain, to Europe in September 1779, but the ship was dismasted 10 days out. Harding, through skillful seamanship, sailed his ship to Martinique for repairs, his passengers continuing on another ship. &quot;Confederacy&quot; raided British merchantmen and guarded convoys until 18 April 1781, when she was forced to surrender to two British ships, &quot;Roebuck&quot; and &quot;Orpheus&quot;. Harding was subsequently exchanged, commanded the letter of marque &quot;Diana&quot;, but was captured again. After this release, the fighting captain volunteered to serve as First Lieutenant to John Barry in &quot;Alliance&quot;, and was wounded on board during the last engagement of the revolution with HMS &quot;Sybil&quot;, off Cape Canaveral, Florida. He was known as &quot;the Harding&quot; by the king of France. He had a great relation to France.

Harding spent his last years as a merchant sailor and in retirement in Schoharie, New York, where he died.

==Namesake==
Several ships called USS &quot;Harding&quot; were named in his honor.

<text>USS &quot;Talbot&quot; (DD-114) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and later designated APD-7 in World War II. She was the first ship named in honor of Silas Talbot.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Talbot&quot; was laid down on 12 July 1917 at Philadelphia by William Cramp &amp; Sons. The ship was launched on 20 February 1918, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Major. The destroyer was commissioned on 20 July 1918, Lieutenant Commander Isaac Foote Dortch in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Talbot&quot; stood out of New York on 31 July and steamed to the British Isles. She made three more round-trip voyages to England and, in December, called at Brest, France. In 1919, she joined the Pacific Fleet and operated with it until 31 March 1923 when she was decommissioned at San Diego. On 17 July 1920, the ship was designated DD-114 while in reserve.

&quot;Talbot&quot; was recommissioned on 31 May 1930, and joined Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 10 of the Battle Force at San Diego. She remained with Battle Force until 1937 when she went to Hawaii to support Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet for a year. In 1939, she served with the Battle Force and the Submarine Force. In 1940 and 1941, the destroyer was based at San Diego.

===World War II===
The day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Talbot&quot; got underway in the screen of the aircraft carrier and headed for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor exactly a week after the Japanese raid, patrolled off the islands for ten days, and returned to San Diego. In February 1942, the ship joined the Patrol Force of the 12th Naval District and escorted convoys along the Pacific coast.

Late in May, &quot;Talbot&quot; stood out of Puget Sound to escort the submarines , , and to Alaska. They arrived at Dutch Harbor on 2 June and were subjected to a small and unsuccessful air attack the next day. With the exception of three escort trips back to Seattle, the destroyer performed patrol and escort duty in Alaskan waters for the next seven months. On 31 October 1942, the ship was reclassified a high-speed transport and redesignated APD-7. &quot;Talbot&quot; departed Dutch Harbor on 31 January 1943 to be converted by the Mare Island Navy Yard into a small but fast troopship. The work, enabling &quot;Talbot&quot; to transport 147 combat troops, was completed on 15 March.

The next day, the high-speed transport got underway for Hawaii, and she arrived at Pearl Harbor the following week. On 2 April, she headed for Espiritu Santo to join Transport Division (TransDiv) 12. For two months, the APD participated in training exercises with her division and also escorted ships to New Caledonia, New Zealand, Australia, and Guadalcanal.

In mid-June, she joined Task Group (TG) 31.1, the Rendova Attack Group, for the invasion of New Georgia. She and were to capture two small islands that controlled the entrance to Roviana Lagoon from Blanche Channel. The two ships embarked troops of the 169th Infantry Regiment at Guadalcanal, and, on 30 June, they were off their assigned beaches when the assault began. Heavy rains obscured the islands, and &quot;Zane&quot; ran aground at 0230. After landing her troops and supplies without opposition, &quot;Talbot&quot; attempted to pull the minesweeper free but failed. Then, arrived and pulled &quot;Zane&quot; free while &quot;Talbot&quot; provided air protection. During the operation, enemy aircraft could be seen attacking the main landing force. On the night of 4 July, the ship and six other high speed transports arrived off Rice Anchorage. During the landing of assault troops the next morning, a Japanese &quot;long-lance&quot; torpedo sank , one of the destroyers of the bombardment group.

&quot;Talbot&quot; returned to Guadalcanal to prepare for the occupation of Vella Lavella. On 14 August, she sortied with TG 31.5, the Advance Transport Group of the Northern Landing Force. The assault forces went ashore from the destroyer transports the next morning, unopposed. However, two hours later, the Japanese began air attacks against the ships and kept up the raids throughout the day. Nevertheless, the American fleet suffered no damage and claimed to have shot down 44 of the enemy planes.

The high-speed transport next devoted over a month to escorting smaller ships and carrying supplies to various islands in the Solomons. Late in September, she joined Admiral George H. Fort&#x27;s Southern Attack Force for the conquest of the Treasury Islands. Eight APDs and 23 smaller landing ships were loaded with troops of the 8th New Zealand Brigade Force. The smaller ships departed Guadalcanal on 23 October and 24 October, and the faster destroyer transports left on 26 October. The following day, the troops landed on Mono and Stirling islands, and the transports had cleared the area by 2000.

On 3 November, &quot;Talbot&quot; called at Noumea to embark reinforcements for troops who, two days before, had landed on the beaches of Bougainville at Empress Augusta Bay. She arrived on 6 November, disembarked her soldiers, loaded 19 casualties and screened a group of landing ship tanks (LSTs) to Guadalcanal. On 11 November, she was back at the beachhead with a resupply echelon. Four days later, she got underway for Guadalcanal. The high-speed transport loaded troops, ammunition, and rations; held a practice landing; and headed for Bougainville. On 16 November, the destroyer transport and her five sister ships rendezvoused with a group of LSTs and destroyers. At 0300, a Japanese snooper aircraft dropped a flare astern of the convoy. It was followed by enemy bombers which attacked for almost an hour before hitting and setting her afire. Although under constant air attack, &quot;Talbot&quot;″s boats rescued 68 crew members and 106 marine passengers from the stricken ship.

&quot;Talbot&quot; continued to Cape Torokina and arrived there in the midst of another air attack. She landed her troops and headed for Guadalcanal.

After her engines were at Nouméa in December, the ship made a round-trip to Sydney. On 8 January 1944, she departed New Caledonia for Espiritu Santo to pick up a convoy and escort it to Guadalcanal. She arrived off Lunga Point on 13 January and patrolled between there and Koli Point for two weeks. On 28 January, the fast transport embarked elements of the 30th New Zealand Battalion and a group of intelligence and communications specialists of the United States Navy and headed for the Green Islands to participate in a reconnaissance in force.

On the night of 30 January, the destroyer transports landed the raiding party; withdrew from the area; and returned the next night to pick them up. &quot;Talbot&quot; disembarked the New Zealanders at Vella Lavella and the Navy men at Guadalcanal. On 13 February, &quot;Talbot&quot; reembarked New Zealand troops and sortied with TF 31, the Green Islands Attack Group. She was off Bara-hun Island on 15 February and launched her part of the assault wave. She then shuttled reinforcements and supplies from Guadalcanal to the Green Islands.

On 17 March, the transport loaded elements of the 2d Battalion, 4th Marines, at Guadalcanal and sailed with the amphibious force to the St. Matthias Islands. The Marines peacefully occupied Emirau on 20 March, and &quot;Talbot&quot; returned to Purvis Bay. She headed to New Guinea on 4 April to participate in practice landings with the 168nd Army Regimental Combat Team (RCT). Two weeks later, she loaded 145 men of that regiment and sortied with TG 77.3, the Fire Support Group, for the assault on Aitape. On 22 April, &quot;Talbot&quot; landed her troops; shelled Tumleo Island; and returned to Cape Cretin. She escorted resupply echelons to the landing area until 10 May when the transports were released by the 7th Fleet.

&quot;Talbot&quot; joined the 5th Fleet at Guadalcanal on 13 May and began training with underwater demolition teams. On 4 June, she joined a convoy to the Marshalls and arrived at Kwajalein on 8 June. Two days later, the high-speed transport joined TG 53.15 of the Southern Attack Force and got underway for the Marianas. However, she collided with the battleship during an emergency turn; and the resulting flooding of several of her compartments forced her to return for repairs. &quot;Talbot&quot; got underway two days later, rejoined the group southeast of Saipan, and was off the beaches there on 15 June, D-Day. During the first days of the operation, she screened the bombardment group. On 17 June, she captured a survivor of a wrecked Japanese boat. The ship developed engine trouble and anchored in the transport area where an enemy plane dropped a stick of bombs off her port bow, but caused no damage. She transferred her underwater demolition team to and joined a convoy for Hawaii. She was then routed back to San Francisco for an overhaul that lasted from 11 July to 28 August.

&quot;Talbot&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor early in September and steamed onward to Eniwetok and Manus. She embarked Underwater Demolition Team No. 3 on 12 October and sortied with TG 77.6, the Bombardment and Fire Support Group, for Leyte. On 18 October, her swimmers made a daylight reconnaissance of the waters between San Jose and Dulag. Although opposed by enemy machine-gun and mortar fire, the team reembarked with no casualties. The transport departed with a convoy and arrived at Seeadler Harbor on 27 October, where she transferred the demolition team to on the last day of the month.

&quot;Talbot&quot; headed toward Oro Bay, joined , escorted her to Cape Gloucester, and returned to Seeadler Harbor on the 8th. Two days later, she was anchored there, only some from , when that ammunition ship suddenly exploded and showered her with over of metal and debris. The transport was holed in several places and some crew members were injured. &quot;Talbot&quot;″s boats searched for survivors but found none.

On 15 December 1944, after the high-speed transport&#x27;s damage had been repaired at Manus, &quot;Talbot&quot; got underway and proceeded, via Aitape, to Noemfoor Island to participate in amphibious exercises with the 158th RCT. On 4 January 1945, she embarked troops and sortied with Task Unit 77.9.8 for Lingayen Gulf. The ship landed reinforcements at San Fabian the following week and continued on to Leyte. She embarked troops of the 11th Airborne Division on 26 January and headed for Luzon with a convoy. On 31 January, she disembarked the troops as the second wave against Nasugbu and steamed to Mindoro. She loaded mortar and rocket boats and delivered them to Leyte.

On 14 February, the high-speed transport embarked units of the 151st Infantry Regiment and steamed to Bataan. She landed the troops at Mariveles Bay the next morning and returned to Subic Bay. On 17 February, she took a load of reinforcements to Corregidor. The transport escorted a convoy back to Ulithi and remained there for several weeks before being ordered to Guam. &quot;Talbot&quot; and proceeded to Parece Vela to conduct a survey of the reef and determine the feasibility of erecting a radio, weather, and observation station there. She returned to Guam on 20 April and reached Ulithi the next day.

On 22 April, &quot;Talbot&quot; joined a convoy bound for Okinawa. Five days later, she began antisubmarine patrols south of Kerama Retto and then, on 30 April, joined a convoy for Saipan. She returned to Kerama Retto and served as a picket ship from 22 May to 6 June when she went back to Saipan. From the Marianas, the high speed transport was routed to Eniwetok, Hawaii, and the United States.

&quot;Talbot&quot; arrived at San Pedro on 6 July and was to be reconverted into a destroyer. Her classification reverted to DD-114 on 16 July. However, a Board of Inspection and Survey recommended that she be inactivated. &quot;Talbot&quot; was decommissioned on 9 October and struck from the Navy list on 24 October 1945. She was sold to the Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland, on 30 January 1946 and scrapped.

<text>McSweeney&#x27;s Publishing is an American nonprofit publishing house founded by Dave Eggers in 1998 and headquartered in San Francisco. The executive director is Amanda Uhle.

McSweeney&#x27;s first publication was the literary journal&quot; Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot; in 1998. Since then, the company has published novels, books of poetry, and other periodicals.

==Company history==
McSweeney&#x27;s distributor was Publishers Group West (PGW) from 2002 until the end of 2006, when its parent company, Advanced Marketing Services, filed for bankruptcy. At the time of the filing, PGW owed McSweeney&#x27;s about $600,000. To recover the funds, McSweeney&#x27;s accepted a deal from the publishing group and distributor, Perseus Books Group, that offered payment of 70 cents on the dollar owed by PGW. In June 2007, McSweeney&#x27;s held a successful sale and eBay auction to help make up the difference.

Since 2013, McSweeney&#x27;s archives have been held in the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas. They include material from the company&#x27;s founding and early history.

In October 2014, Dave Eggers announced that McSweeney&#x27;s would become a nonprofit publishing house and asked readers for donations for several projects. Eggers cited declining sales and more fundraising opportunities as the reasons for McSweeney&#x27;s long-discussed change.

In 2015, McSweeney&#x27;s expanded into brand copywriting, working in partnership with marketers at Converse, Warby Parker, and Airbnb.

In 2019, McSweeney&#x27;s began publishing &quot;Illustoria&quot; magazine, founded by Joanne Meiyi Chan.

===Company name===
In 2004, Eggers said that when he was a child his family received letters from someone named Timothy McSweeney, who claimed to be a relative of his mother. The letters arrived as a result of the coincidence that his grandfather, who delivered Timothy at birth, and the family who adopted Timothy had the same last name: McSweeney.

==Publications==
In addition to a book list of approximately ten titles a year, McSweeney&#x27;s publishes the quarterly literary journal &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot;, the daily-updated humor site &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Internet Tendency&quot;, and &quot;Illustoria&quot;, an art and storytelling magazine for children aged 6 to 11. McSweeney&#x27;s also published the bimonthly magazine &quot;The Believer&quot;, the quarterly food journal &quot;Lucky Peach,&quot; and the sports journal &quot;Grantland Quarterly&quot;, in association with sports and pop culture website Grantland. 

McSweeney&#x27;s occasionally runs additional imprints, including the children&#x27;s book department McSweeney&#x27;s McMullens, McSweeney&#x27;s Poetry Series, and the Collins Library, which reprints unusual titles. 

The Organist, a podcast produced by the editors of &quot;The Believer&quot; and KCRW, launched in 2012.

A quarterly DVD magazine, &quot;Wholphin&quot;, ran from 2005 to 2012. 

===Authors===
Emerging writers involved with McSweeney&#x27;s include Rebecca Curtis, Paul Legault, Philipp Meyer, and Wells Tower. Other contributors include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Michael Chabon, Stephen King, David Foster Wallace, George Saunders, Michael Ian Black, Nick Hornby, Joyce Carol Oates, Hilton Als, and Rachel Z. Arndt. 

McSweeney&#x27;s has also published the work of musicians, critics and artists including David Byrne and Beck. The band One Ring Zero performed at early McSweeney&#x27;s events in New York and solicited lyric-writing assistance from McSweeney&#x27;s contributors for their 2004 album, &quot;As Smart As We Are.&quot; 

McSweeney&#x27;s was the subject of the They Might Be Giants song &quot;The Ballad of Timothy McSweeney.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;Fast Company&quot; ranked McSweeney&#x27;s #7 on their list of the most innovative media companies in the US in 2012. McSweeney&#x27;s literary journal is a three-time winner of the National Magazine Award for Fiction, and an 8-time finalist. In 2001, the &quot;New York Times&quot; was less flattering when it noted &quot;The McSweeneyites may be the current emperors of cool, but they&#x27;re starting to need some new clothes.&quot;

In 2019, Vida hailed &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot; as the magazine that publishes the highest percentage of women and trans writers (71%) compared to peer publications.

In 2021, Axios reported that readership tripled across McSweeney&#x27;s web and print publications.

<text>Wingerode is a municipality in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, Germany. In 1996, Wingerode celebrated its 850th anniversary. It was founded in 1146.

In 1174 Henry the Lion, Duke of Bavaria and Saxony, bought the village from Volkenroda Abbey. Since the 17th century, the local Ignatius chapel has been the object of pilgrimages. Wingerode belonged to the Electorate of Mainz until the secularization of 1802 and was subject to the jurisdiction of the von Hanstein family. From 1802 to 1807, the village was Prussian, and then it came to the Kingdom of Westphalia. From 1815 to 1945 it was part of the Prussian Province of Saxony. At the end of World War II, it was in the Soviet occupation zone and in 1949 became part of East Germany. From 1961 until reunification in 1990, Wingerode was affected by the closure of the nearby inner German border. Since 1990, the municipality is part of the re-established state of Thuringia.
