<text>UBERMORGEN.COM is a Swiss-Austrian-American artist duo founded in 1995 and consisting of lizvlx and Luzius Bernhard. They live and work in Basel, S-chanf near St. Moritz and in Vienna, where both are professors at the University of Applied Arts Vienna.

== Work ==
Their main body of work consists of internet art/net.art, installation, video art, photography, software art, performance and uses the convergence of digital media to produce and publish online and offline.

Their early works were &quot;media hacking&quot; projects using low-tech tools to reach very large audiences. During the work on their best known project Voteauction (2000) CNN.com called them &quot;Maverick Austrian Businessmen&quot;. The project resulted in an onslaught of lawsuits issued by Illinois, Texas, Arizona, California, Missouri, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin.

In 2001, they started a collaboration with Christoph Schlingensief for the development and staging of a Hamlet project in Zurich: NAZI~LINE, a bigger than life fake neo-Nazi helpline and exit strategy finding agency.

In 2005 they started the EKMRZ Trilogy, a series of conceptual hacks (GWEI – Google Will Eat Itself, Amazon Noir and The Sound of eBay).

Between 2007–2011 their focus went into research-based productions (Superenhanced, WOPPOW, KRAFT Series) and Rock Art productions such as TORTURE CLASSICS and CLICKISTAN (commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art). They started to work extensively with video during this period.

Since 1999 their work has been shown in museums and galleries in Europe, America, Africa, Australia and Asia and include venues such as SFMOMA, Centre Pompidou, Konsthall Malmoe, NTT ICC Museum Tokyo, Gwangju Design Biennale, ZKM Karlsruhe, MUMOK Vienna, Ars Electronica Linz, WRO Media Art Biennale Wrocław, MoCA Taipei, Witte de With Rotterdam, Lentos Art Museum Linz, Biennale of Sydney, ARCO Madrid and the New Museum New York.

They have been represented by Fabio Paris Brescia, [DAM] Berlin and Carroll / Fletcher London.

===Injunction generator===
The Injunction Generator is an artistic software module by Ubermorgen which claims to generate on request legal injunctions and personalized documentation in .rtf/.pdf format to force a website into taking its contents offline.

Carrying on with their principles of &quot;radical corporative marketing strategy&quot; (media hacking), the artists produced an effective and credible interface which helps creating one&#x27;s own documented cease-and-desist request, which is then automatically sent to the DNS administrators, to the site&#x27;s owner and to some journalists to trick them into supporting the &quot;public trial&quot;.

The project is published at &quot;ipnic.org&quot;, an acronym which mimics the official protocols (Internet Protocol - Network Information Center), revisited as &quot;Internet Partnership for No Internet Content&quot;.

This sarcastic provocation (a &quot;public shutdown service&quot;) was conceived after experiencing a similar mishap during the Voteauction art project, which in 2000 invited American citizens to put up their vote for auction. At the time an email injunction by an American court was sent to the Swiss internet service provider hosting the site, who immediately took them offline even though emailed documents aren&#x27;t legally considered official and even though Switzerland is outside of American jurisdiction.

==Life and career==

Lizvlx and Luzius Bernhard are an artist duo but also a couple in private life. They are engaged and have two children, Billie-Ada (2003) and Lola Mae (2007).

Lizvlx was born in Linz (AT) and grew up in Wels, Salzburg and Elmira (Upstate New York). Luzius Bernhard was born at the Yale University Hospital in New Haven (USA), grew up in New Haven and Basel (CH) and moved to Vienna (AT) to study with Prof. Peter Weibel, and later on with Prof. Lev Manovich (UCSD), Prof. Peter Lunenfeld (Art Center College of Design) Pasadena and Prof. Bazon Brock (emeritus) :de:Bazon Brock (Wuppertal) and completed his studies in 1999.

Due to his drug abuse and a manic episode in Cape Town 2002, Luzius Bernhard was diagnosed bipolar.

Their earliest works were part of the avantgarde Net.art movement (etoy, 1994–1998, 194.152.164.137, 1996) and were exclusively shown online (World Wide Web/WWW). This work became part of the Internet art and Digital art history and is researched at universities (dissertations, thesis) and taught in (Art history).

The collaboration with both their children (Superenhanced &amp; Spielendes Baby – Schlafendes Baby (original title)), the inclusion of Luzius&#x27;s mental illness and the merger of private and public life led some critics and academics to consider UBERMORGEN.COM as a Gesamtkunstwerk.

Important personal and artistic influences were early meetings with Jean Tinguely, Joseph Beuys, Daniel Spoerri and Eberhard W. Kornfeld in the Basel art scene of the 1980s and with Niki de Saint Phalle in St. Moritz, and the long-time relationship (going back to 1916 during the first world war and the purchase of a Giovanni Giacometti painting by the grand-grandfather of Luzius Bernhard) with the Giacometti family (Giovanni Giacometti, Alberto Giacometti) in the nearby mountain valleys Val Bregaglia and Engadin in the canton Grisons in Switzerland.

==Network==
Over the last 15 years UBERMORGEN.COM has been part of the global contemporary technology art scene. Some mentionable connections and collaborations from this period: Net.Artists Alexei Shulgin, Heath Bunting, Olia Lialina, Vuk Ćosić and with contemporary artists Aram Bartholl, Paolo Cirio, James Powderly and Evan Roth from Free Art and Technology Lab and Graffiti Research Lab, Franco and Eva Mattes (0100101110101101.org), IRWIN, Franz West, Janez Janša, Johannes Grenzfurthner (monochrom), Carsten Nicolai, Minerva Cuevas, The Yes Men, Zhang Peili, Jodi, Miltos Manetas, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Trevor Paglen, Douglas Rushkoff, Lev Manovich, Olga Goriunova and Nicolas Bourriaud.

<text>Theta is General Motors&#x27; automobile platform for compact/mid-size crossover SUVs. The architecture debuted in 2002 with the Saturn Vue and was later used for the Chevrolet Equinox and Captiva and similar models.

==Development==
The Theta uses a four-wheel independent suspension. Engine choices include the Family II straight-4, Ecotec straight-4, &quot;3400&quot; V6, and even a Honda V6, the L66. A 5-speed automatic and two 5-speed manual transmissions are used.

The original Saturn Vue used a short 106.6 in (2708 mm) wheelbase, with a 61 in (1549 mm) track. The Chevrolet Equinox and Pontiac Torrent use a stretched 112.5 in (2857 mm) wheelbase, but share much with the Saturn.

The Suzuki Grand Vitara, although similar in size and appearance to a Saturn Vue, was developed by Suzuki using some Theta components, but should not be considered a Theta derivative.

Engineering for the Opel Antara and Chevrolet Captiva was performed in large part in Korea by GM Daewoo Auto &amp; Technology, and by Opel in Germany.

==Hybrids==
The Saturn Vue was one of the first of General Motors&#x27; vehicles to be offered with a hybrid powertrain, GM&#x27;s belt alternator starter (BAS) system, in 2006.

==Vehicles==

==Theta Premium==

General Motors has created a premium version of Theta for luxury applications. It mixed elements of the current Theta and the new Epsilon 2 architecture. Thus this platform is sometimes also referred to as Theta-Epsilon (GMT166). Theta Premium supports larger models than the standard platform.

Vehicles using Theta Premium:
* 2010-2016 Cadillac SRX
* 2011 Saab 9-4X

<text>Linda Brown Buck (born January 29, 1947) is an American biologist best known for her work on the olfactory system. She was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, along with Richard Axel, for their work on olfactory receptors. She is currently on the faculty of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.

== Personal life ==
Linda B. Buck was born in Seattle, Washington on January 29, 1947. Her father was an electrical engineer who spent his time inventing and building different items in his spare time, while her mother was a homemaker who spent a majority of her free time solving word puzzles. Buck was the second of three children, all of them girls. Her father has Irish ancestry as well as ancestors dating back to the American revolution. Her mother is of Swedish ancestry. In 1994 Buck met Roger Brent, also a biologist. The two married in 2006.

==Education==
Buck received her B.S. in psychology and microbiology in 1975 from the University of Washington, Seattle. She is the first female University of Washington alumnus to win the Nobel Prize. She was awarded her Ph.D. in immunology in 1980 under the direction of Professor Ellen Vitetta at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.

==Career and research==
In 1980, Buck began postdoctoral research at Columbia University under Benvenuto Pernis (1980–1982). In 1982, she joined the laboratory of Richard Axel, also at Columbia in the Institute of Cancer Research. After reading Sol Snyder&#x27;s group research paper at Johns Hopkins University, Buck set out to map the olfactory process at the molecular level, tracing the travel of odors through the cells of the nose to the brain. Buck and Axel worked with rat genes in their research and identified a family of genes that code for more than 1000 odor receptors and published these findings in 1991. Later that year, Buck became an assistant professor in the Neurobiology Department at Harvard Medical School where she established her own lab. After finding how odors are detected by the nose, Buck published her findings in 1993 on how the inputs from different odor receptors are organized in the nose. Essentially, her primary research interest is on how pheromones and odors are detected in the nose and interpreted in the brain. She is a Full Member of the Basic Sciences Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and an Affiliate Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Washington, Seattle.

== Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (2004) ==
In her landmark paper published in 1991 with Richard Axel, Linda Buck discovered hundreds of genes code for the odorant sensors located in the olfactory neurons of our noses. Each receptor is a protein that changes when an odor attaches to the receptor, causing an electrical signal to be sent to the brain. Differences between odorant sensors mean that certain odors cause a signal to be released from a certain receptor. We are then able to interpret varying signals from our receptors as specific scents. To do this, Buck and Axel cloned olfactory receptors, showing that they belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. By analyzing rat DNA, they estimated that there were approximately 1,000 different genes for olfactory receptors in the mammalian genome. This research opened the door to the genetic and molecular analysis of the mechanisms of olfaction. In their later work, Buck and Axel have shown that each olfactory receptor neuron remarkably only expresses one kind of olfactory receptor protein and that the input from all neurons expressing the same receptor is collected by a single dedicated glomerulus of the olfactory bulb.

==Awards and honors==
Buck was awarded the Takasago Award for Research in Olfaction (1992), Unilever Science Award (1996), R.H. Wright Award in Olfactory Research (1996), Lewis S. Rosenstiel Award for Distinguished Work in Basic Medical Research (1996), Perl/UNC Neuroscience Prize (2002), and Gairdner Foundation International Award (2003). In 2005, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Buck was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences in 2003 and the Institutes of Medicine in 2006. Buck has been a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2008. She also sits on the Selection Committee for Life Science and Medicine which chooses winners of the Shaw Prize. In 2015, Buck was awarded an honorary doctorate by Harvard University and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS).

== Retractions ==
Buck retracted 3 papers, published in &quot;Nature&quot; (pub. 2001, retracted 2008), &quot;Science&quot; (pub 2006, retracted 2010) and &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; (pub 2005, retracted 2010) due to falsification/fabrication of results by lead author and collaborator Zhihua Zou.

<doc id="1039177" wikidata="Q482430" url="?curid=1039177" title="Hyundai Tucson">
<text>The Hyundai Tucson (; ) is a compact crossover SUV produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai. It is named after the city of Tucson, Arizona.

The second-generation model was marketed as the Hyundai ix35 in several markets, including Europe, Australia and China, before reverting to Tucson for the third-generation. Since its first-generation, the Tucson has been developed alongside the Kia Sportage, sharing platforms and engines.

The Tucson is the best-selling Hyundai model, with more than 7 million units sold globally since it launched in 2004. Of these, 1.4 million units have been sold in Europe. 


== First generation (JM; 2004) ==

The first-generation Tucson was launched in 2004, after its name was announced in November 2003. Positioned as a smaller alternative to the Santa Fe, it shared its Hyundai Elantra-based platform with the second-generation Kia Sportage.

===Markets===
====North America====

In the U.S., the Tucson was offered in base GLS, mid-line SE, and top-tier Limited (formerly LX) trim levels for 2007 models. Earlier 2005 and 2006 models were offered as GL/GLS/Limited. Standard equipment included air conditioning, six airbags, electronic stability control, a CD player, alloy wheels, remote keyless entry, and premium cloth seats. The SE added to the roster with contrasting gray body cladding, a different alloy design, an AM/FM/Cassette/CD as well as fog lights and a front windshield wiper de-icing grid. The Limited added leather seating surfaces, a 6-disc in dash CD changer, body-coloured cladding, automatic climate control, and heated seats. The GLS and Limited were only available with the 2.7 L V6. The GL came only with the 2.0-litre four-cylinder.

The Tucson offers modest cargo space but its easy-to-fold seats can expand this volume so they lie flat. Even the front passenger seat folds flat for extra-long cargo.

=====Safety=====
There are dual-stage frontal impact airbags, torso side-impact airbags built into the front seats, and curtain airbags for side-impact protection for front and rear passengers.

=====Model year changes=====

In 2006, the LX became the Limited and got colour-coded cladding, automatic climate control, and a high-performance sound system. The GLS retained the gray cladding but &#x27;HYUNDAI&#x27; is no longer branded into the cladding on the front doors. The GLS also got improved cloth seats with the option of a heating element. Both GLS and Limited got redesigned alloy wheels. The base GL remained unchanged.

In 2007, the GL and GLS trims were respectively renamed to GLS and SE to match the standard for all new Hyundai vehicles. The SE comes with a sport utility rack, has 4-wheel drive, and is a 6-cylinder engine.

2009 Tucsons saw restyling and trim changes.

=====Tucson FCEV=====

The Tucson Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) is a test fuel cell vehicle for Hyundai&#x27;s second-generation hydrogen fuel cell. The vehicle includes an 80 kW electric motor by Enova Systems of Torrance, California, UTC Fuel Cells by South Windsor, Connecticut, 152V battery co-developed by Hyundai Motor Co. and LG Chem in Seoul, Korea, hydrogen storage tanks developed by Dynetek Industries of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The vehicle has range of and top speed of .

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show and completed a journey as part of the Hydrogen Road Tour in 2008.

====Other markets====
In Japan, the Hyundai Tucson was sold as the Hyundai JM until November 2009.

In Brazil, the Hyundai Tucson was produced from October 2009 until the second half of 2018, initially in GL and GLS trim levels - the former available only with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine and a choice between a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission, and the latter offering a 2.7-litre V6 engine in addition to the 2.0-litre four-cylinder, both mated exclusively to the 4-speed auto.

A facelifted version of the first-generation exclusive to China was produced by Beijing Hyundai. The second-generation Tucson was renamed to ix35 in China and Brazil, and later became an independent model while the Tucson name returned with the introduction of the third-generation.

=== Powertrain ===


===Reception===
The Hyundai Tucson received accolades from Canadian Car of the Year &quot;Best New Crossover&quot; award for 2005. It was named as one of the most reliable vehicles from the 2009 Consumer Reports reliability survey.

===Safety===
The first-generation Tucson in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants, 3 stars for toddlers, and 1 star for pedestrians from Euro NCAP in 2006.

== Second generation (LM; 2009) ==

In most markets outside South Korea and North America, the Hyundai Tucson name (also known as the &quot;Hyundai Tucson ix&quot; in Korea) was changed to Hyundai ix35. Vehicles sold in the North America and several other regions continued to be called Tucson. The ix35 was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The power output, fuel-efficiency, comfort and safety features were claimed to have been all upgraded. Known by the project name &quot;LM&quot;, it took 36 months and 280 billion won (approx. US$225 million) to develop.

The ix35&#x27;s styling was reported to be based on Hyundai ix-onic concept. The ix35 was penned by Hyundai designer Cha Il-Hoei in 2007, under the guidance of former BMW designer Thomas Bürkle at Hyundai&#x27;s Rüsselsheim design studio in Germany and continues the company&#x27;s styling language, marketed as &quot;fluidic sculpture&quot;. The compact crossover vehicle has sweeping coupe-like lines, a premium vehicle feel and comes with features unavailable on its predecessor.

=== Facelift ===
The facelifted Tucson was released in South Korea on 2 May 2013, based on the European market ix35 styling with new grille, projector headlights, tail lights, rounded fog lights and front bumper. This facelift was also released in China in August 2013 under the ix35 nameplate, and was not applied in most markets outside South Korea and China, especially in Europe, where only headlights and tail lights were changed, and in North America and Australia, where it retained the pre-facelift styling with only headlights were changed. While in Indonesia, the Tucson received its own facelift in April 2014 based on the global model styling with new grille (similar to the South Korean and Chinese markets), projector headlights, tail lights and fog lights.

=== Markets ===

==== United States ====
The Tucson sold in the United States came in three trims: GL, GLS and Limited, with all-wheel drive available for GLS and Limited trims. The GL comes with a standard manual transmission, but a 6-speed automatic transmission is available and is standard on GLS and Limited. The North American version uses a different gauge cluster design than the Korean version.

The 2011 Tucson offered in the U.S. a new GL trim which replaces the 2010 GLS model as Tucson&#x27;s base trim. The GL is powered by a new 2.0-litre 4-cylinder engine mated to either a five-speed manual or an available six-speed automatic transmission in order to obtain better fuel economy than the 2.4-litre engine.

2014 model year Tucson for North America have been upgraded with GDI direct injected Theta II engines that obtain more power and better emissions, LED tail/head lights, more stylish alloy rim designs, and a few minor improvements to the interior/audio system.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, the ix35 is available in Active, Elite and Highlander trim levels. The 2.0-litre &quot;Theta II&quot; petrol engine in front-wheel drive is available on Active and Elite trims, while the 2.4-litre &quot;Theta II&quot; petrol engine and the 2.0-litre &quot;R-series&quot; diesel engine are available on Elite and Highlander trims.

==== Europe ====
The European market ix35 has a restyled grille, front bumper, rounded fog lights and projector headlights, to differentiate it with global models. This styling was also sold in Malaysia from November 2012 as the Tucson.

In the United Kingdom, the ix35 was initially available in Style and Premium trim levels. It received an update in September 2013 with new headlights and tail lights, and is available in S, SE and Premium trim levels.

==== China ====
In China, the first-generation Tucson was sold alongside the ix35, which adopted the European market styling, and was replaced by the third-generation Tucson directly while the ix35 spawned its own successor, the Hyundai ix35 (NU). The ix35 NU was revealed on the 2017 Shanghai Auto Show in China and was available to the Chinese car market in the third quarter of 2017.

=== Powertrain ===

The Tucson/ix35 is available with several engines: an all-new 2.0-litre diesel R engine, one of two Theta-II petrol engine variants (2.0-litre or 2.4-litre), 1.7-litre UII diesel and 1.6-litre Gamma GDI petrol. The later two only in Europe. The automatic transmission is Hyundai&#x27;s all-new six-speed design. The manual transmissions available in Europe is a 6-speed for 1.7-litre and 2.0-litre diesels and 1.6 Gamma and a 5-speed for 2.0 Theta. The 2.0-litre diesel engine, available outside of North America, meets the Euro-5 emissions standards and achieves fuel economy with maximum power output of . The 2.0-litre petrol engine has a fuel economy of with . In South Korea, the diesel engine is offered in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations, while the 2.0-litre petrol engine is available only in front-wheel drive.

The North American versions are powered by either the 2.0-litre producing or a 2.4-litre four-cylinder petrol engine producing mated to the six-speed automatic transmission. The 2.4-litre engine makes almost the same power as the previous generation V6 engine while managing 20% better fuel economy than the previous generation four-cylinder.

===Safety===

The second-generation Tucson earned &#x27;Top Safety Pick&#x27; award in 2010 from Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) in the U.S.


== Third generation (TL; 2015) ==
In February 2015, Hyundai released the first details about the third-generation Tucson ahead of the crossover&#x27;s official debut at the Geneva Motor Show on 3 March 2015. This model arrived in showrooms in the second half of 2015, as a 2016 model year. Since this generation, Hyundai has discontinued the use of the ix35 nameplate, reverting to Tucson globally.

The third-generation Tucson measures longer and wider than its predecessor, while riding on a longer wheelbase. Rear storage space is also larger, with seats-up capacity growing from 465 to 513 litres.

Starting from this generation, safety technologies such as lane departure warning, blind spot detection, and auto braking for pedestrians and cars, along with a dual-clutch automatic transmission and torque vectoring known as Hyundai Active Cornering Control are offered.

=== Markets ===

==== North America ====
Revealed in April 2015 for the 2016 model year, the North American market Tucson was offered with a choice of two engines, a 2.0-litre direct-injection four-cylinder delivering and of torque with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine with and of torque paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Both engines are available in front and all-wheel drive versions. Available in July 2015, the 2016 Hyundai Tucson was available in four trim levels: SE, Eco, Sport and Limited.

==== Australia ====
The Tucson was revealed in the country in August 2015. At launch, the Tucson was offered two petrol engines and one diesel, along with 6-speed manual, 6-speed auto and 7-speed dual-clutch auto transmissions. The 2.0-litre petrol engines include the 2.0-litre GDi &quot;Nu&quot; petrol engine, while it was also offered alongside the older 2.0-litre MPi version of the &quot;Nu&quot; engine. Other engines offered are the 1.6-litre T-GDi turbocharged petrol engine and a turbocharged 2.0-litre R-Series diesel engine. Models with the 2.0-litre GDi engine were sourced from South Korea, while the 2.0 MPi, 1.6 T-GDi and 2.0 R-Series variants were imported from the Czech Republic.

=== 2018 facelift ===
First shown at the 2018 New York International Auto Show, the Tucson for the 2019 model year received a facelift and changes to the powertrain options. Exterior updates included a new cascade grille, reshaped hood and tailgate design, rectangular fuel door, new rim designs, and an updated LED headlight design for higher trim levels. The interior received an update to include a newly designed dash with lower centrally-placed air vents and a high-mounted head unit display.

In North America, the Driver Attention Warning (DAW) system is standard across all trim levels, and both the Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) departure/correction system and Front Collision Avoidance Assist (FCA) system are now also standard across all trim levels. The manual and dual clutch transmission options were dropped in favor of the 6-speed Shiftronic automatic used in the previous model. The 2.0-litre Nu GDi engine continues in the SE and Value trim levels but for other trims the 1.6-litre I4 turbocharged engine was dropped and replaced by a 2.4-litre I4 GDi naturally aspirated engine which produces at 6,000 rpm and with a slight loss in fuel economy.

In spring 2019, Hyundai started selling the &quot;N-Line&quot; variant, mainly in the European market.

In August 2020, Hyundai Nishat commenced the local assembly of the facelifted model in Pakistan. Initially, it came in only two trim levels, the FWD GLS Sport and the AWD Ultimate.

<doc id="1039178" wikidata="Q4783151" url="?curid=1039178" title="Arab British Helicopter Company">
<text>The Arab British Helicopter Company (ABHCO), (Arabic:الشركة العربية البريطانية للمروحيات) is an Anglo-Italiano-Egyptian joint venture that specialises in helicopter manufacturing.

It was established during 1978 following an agreement with the British aerospace company Westland Helicopters as an affiliate of the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI). It was intended for the venture to assemble the Westland Lynx helicopter, along with its Rolls-Royce Gem engines, at ABHCO&#x27;s facility in Helwan, 18 miles south of Cairo, Egypt. Despite orders being placed for 250 ABHCO-built Lynx helicopters, none were ever completed due to an economic boycott being enacted on Egypt by the other Arab nations during the late 1970s. Following a licensing agreement, the firm also undertook the manufacture of the Westland Gazelle.

==History==
During the 1970s, Egypt commenced widescale efforts to replace arms imports with domestic production to provide military equipment to the rest of the Middle East as well as to build up Arab military industries. This international initiative was formalised in 1975; Egtpt was joined by various other Arab partner nations in the endeavour, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. On 29 April 1975, these four nations signed a treaty that established the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI), a defense manufacturing interest that based much of its infrastructure, including its headquarters and much of its production facilities, within Egypt.

In parallel with these regional diplomatic developments, Egyptian officials were negotiating multiple industrial and defense-related agreements between both France and Britain. As early as September 1974, the British and Egyptian governments initiated talks to establish a new Egyptian helicopter manufacturer. During March 1978, the &quot;Arab British Helicopter Company&quot; (ABHCO) was formally established in a $595 million deal with Westland Helicopters. It was structured as a joint venture between AOI and Westland, but based in Egypt. Initially, it was intended for ABHCO to engage in the domestic assembly of British Westland Lynx helicopters at ABHCO&#x27;s Helwan facility. In addition to manufacturing the type, other activities, including the overhaul, testing and sale of Lynx helicopters was also envisioned. A separate agreement was formalised with Rolls-Royce to license manufacture the Lynx&#x27;s Gem turboshaft engines at the Helwan facility.

During 1975, an initial order for 42 Westland Gazelles was placed by Egypt. It was agreed that ABHCO would undertake the assembly of these rotorcraft via a recently-acquired licensing agreement. Throughout the 1980s, the company undertook the assembly of a significant number of Gazelles; the associated &quot;British Arab Engine Company&quot; also produced the Turbomeca Astazou turboshaft powerplants for these Egyptian-build Gazelles.

The fortunes of ABHCO were heavily shaped by both Egyptian and international politics alike. Following the signing of the Camp David Accords between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on 17 September 1978, Egypt was subject to an economic boycott by many of its former Arab partners, who also moved to liquidate jointly held assets. This threw the existence of AOI, and therefore ABHCO, into a state of uncertainty for a time. All four member states in ABHCO had placed orders for a cumulative batch of 250 locally-built Lynx helicopters, but these would be cancelled without redress.

In response, Egypt declared that AOI, which had become a major industrial employer in the nation, would become a purely Egyptian endeavour. However, this unilateral declaration posed some legislative difficulties. The company remained active as a manufacturing venture for several years, but accumulated a considerably high level of debt and failed to fulfil licensing payments to Westland. During the 1980s and 1990s, Westland pursued ABHCO over incomplete payments, resorting to legal action being taken against the company.

<text>The Kia Sportage () is a series of automobiles manufactured by the South Korean manufacturer Kia since 1993 through five generations. Initially a compact SUV built on a body-on-frame chassis, the second-generation Sportage transitioned to a car-based platform which placed it into the compact crossover SUV class, and was originally developed alongside the Hyundai Tucson and since the fifth-generation model launched in 2021, in two sizes with different wheelbase lengths for different markets, alongside the Hyundai Santa Fe and the Kia Sorento.

The Sportage has been the best-selling Kia model globally since 2016 after surpassing the Rio. In 2018, the model reached the 5 million production milestone. , the Sportage is positioned between the Seltos or Niro and the three-row Sorento in Kia&#x27;s SUV global lineup with the latter sharing platform with the Sportage.


== First generation (NB; 1993) ==

The first-generation Kia Sportage was developed with a Mazda Bongo engineering base platform. It shares many mechanical components such as the engine, transmissions (early versions), and differentials with the Mazda line of vehicles. This was during Kia&#x27;s alliance with Ford and Mazda, which involved Ford/Mazda providing technology and Kia providing inexpensive manufacturing facilities for Ford Company.

From 1995 to 1998, the Sportage was built by Karmann in Germany; European buyers received German-built versions in that period, while the rest of the world received South Korean-built versions. It was launched in Asia in July 1993 and European sales started two years later.

The Sportage was sold in either a five-door SUV or a three-door soft-top convertible. Kia initially developed the wagon in standard length form, but in circa 1996, the company released an extended length version. This stretched model—mainly sold in Asian markets under the name &quot;Sportage Grand&quot;, but also as the &quot;Grand Wagon&quot;—featured a longer body utilizing the same wheelbase, an increase in luggage capacity from , and the relocation of the spare wheel from the tailgate to underneath the floor.

Kia offered three Mazda-sourced engines in the Sportage, beginning with the 2.0-liter &quot;FE DOHC&quot; inline-four gasoline unit producing and the 2.0-liter &quot;RF&quot; inline-four diesel rated at . Diesel-engined models were mostly restricted to European markets, as was the more basic single overhead camshaft (SOHC) version of the 2.0-liter &quot;FE&quot; gasoline inline-four. Delivering , this gasoline engine was available from 2000 onwards. In North America, the 2.0-liter &quot;FE DOHC&quot; engine produced and had optional four-wheel drive. The 1997 model year Kia Sportage was the world&#x27;s first production vehicle to be equipped with a knee airbag.

This first-generation model (1993–2002) sold in low numbers, even domestically in South Korea, and models after Hyundai&#x27;s 1998 partial takeover of Kia (1997–2002) were recalled twice for rear wheels dismounting while driving. The first-generation Sportage was discontinued in South Korea in 2002, and in North America after the 2002 model year. By 2003, most international markets had discontinued the Sportage range, although it remained on sale in some developing countries until its second-generation replacement arrived in 2005.

The Kia Sportage scored the lowest possible result in the Australian ANCAP crash tests – one star out of five. As well as a failure of the seat belts, the vehicle structure collapsed.

== Second generation (JE/KM; 2004) ==

After a two-year hiatus, the Sportage returned in model-year 2005, sharing a Hyundai Elantra-based platform with the first-generation Hyundai Tucson. A 2.0 L straight-4 diesel engine was available in the United Kingdom. Fans of the original pre-Hyundai Sportage and critics complained that it was considerably larger than the original Sportage and had none of its off-road capability, the two keys to its success. However, buyers of the second-generation model were likely to favor the available V6, with 178 lb·ft of torque (241 N·m). Overall fit/finish and quality was noticeably improved over the first-generation model.

A facelift model of the second generation was introduced in May 2008. From 2006, it was manufactured at the Žilina Plant in Slovakia. A second facelift was introduced in the UK in early 2009, only a few months after its first facelift.

The Sportage was named as one of the most reliable vehicles from the 2009 Consumer Reports reliability survey. and ranked second in the &quot;20 least expensive 2009 vehicles to insure&quot; list by Insure.com.

===Safety===
The second-generation Sportage earned a top rating of five stars in crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) rated it only “acceptable” for frontal and side impact crash protection and “poor” for roof strength.

== Third generation (SL; 2010) ==

The SL series Sportage was released to Asian and European markets in April 2010, the North and Central American markets in August 2010, and the Australian market in October 2010, for the 2011 model year. Two engines were available, a 2.0-liter Hyundai R diesel engine with , and a 2.0-liter &quot;Theta T-GDi&quot; gasoline engine. In China, it was released by Dongfeng Yueda Kia in October 2010 and called the Sportage R, and was to be built and marketed alongside the previous generation rather than as a replacement for it.

The Sportage won the 2011 &quot;Car of the Year&quot; (originally &quot;Auto roku 2011 na Slovensku&quot;) in Slovakia and &quot;Truck of the Year&quot; nomination of International Car of the Year. It was top of the JD Power Survey for 2012, the only car in the survey to score five stars across all categories, from mechanical reliability to ownership costs and the dealer experience. In South Africa, it took the 2013 Standard Bank People&#x27;s Wheels Award for &quot;SUVs and Crossovers – City &amp; Suburban&quot;.

=== Safety ===
====Euro NCAP====
The Sportage in its standard European market configuration received 5 stars from Euro NCAP in 2010.

====IIHS====
The third-generation Sportage received a &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the United States. Earning the award became tougher in 2010 when IIHS added the rollover crash test, which measures roof strength and is twice as stringent as the federal requirement. To pass this test, a vehicle&#x27;s roof must be able to withstand the force of three times the vehicle&#x27;s weight (acceptable rating). The federal standard requires a roof to hold 1.5 times the vehicle&#x27;s weight.

<text>Anno Museum (formerly &quot;Hedmarks fylkesmuseum&quot;) in Hamar, Norway is a regional museum for the municipalities of Stange, Hamar (which now includes Vang), Løten, and Ringsaker in central eastern Norway. It includes the medieval Cathedral Ruins in Hamar mentioned in Sigrid Undset&#x27;s literary magnum opus &quot;Kristin Lavransdatter&quot;. The cathedral ruins are secured under a glass shelter designed by Lund &amp; Slaatto Architects and completed in 1998.

The museum also consists of the cathedral gardens, folk museum and active herb garden featuring plants used during the Middle Ages. Additionally the museum houses one of the largest photography collections in Norway, covering the entire region of Hedemarken since photography was first introduced.

==Museum attractions==
There are several noteworthy aspects to the museum:

* Its medieval section includes the ruins of a cathedral as well as remnants of a bishop&#x27;s priory. The cathedral was originally constructed of locally quarried limestone in Romanesque architecture, although later additions were of Gothic architecture. The distinctive arches in the cathedral ruins are covered by a steel and glass structure designed by Lund &amp; Slaatto and undertaken by the Norwegian government.
*The cathedral was never deconsecrated, and remains under the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church - weddings can only be performed there with the permission of the church.
* Its ethnological museum provides a good sense of how people in the region lived from about the 16th century until the early 20th century. It includes buildings and courtyards collected from across the Hedemarken region, many of which have been restored to their original appearance. Among other noteworthy buildings, the collection includes one of the finest 19th century residential homes from the area.
* It is an active archeological site, and visitors can see the state of the dig at any given time. Most of the medieval town is as yet unexcavated, and visitors can visit the site in a field outside the confines of the museum.
* It is located in a beautiful recreational area along Lake Mjøsa. The recreational area is open to the public and includes a swimming area, gravel walkways, grass lawns, and a long shoreline.
* Storhamarlåven was designed by architect Sverre Fehn (1924–2009) in concrete, wood and glass to contrast with the stone of the medieval ruins. It was originally a barn built beside the ruins in the 17th century for the farm Storhamar. The architect sought to both highlight the original medieval structure and the more recent farm building. Its design won the Betongtavlen architectural award in 1976. Ramps provide the means to view the museum from above.

<text>Dora Maria Sigerson Shorter (16 August 1866 – 6 January 1918) was an Irish poet and sculptor, who after her marriage in 1895 wrote under the name Dora Sigerson Shorter.

==Life==
She was born in Dublin, Ireland, the daughter of George Sigerson, a surgeon and writer, and Hester Varian, also a writer. She was the oldest of four children. The family home at 3 Clare Street was a gathering-place for artists and writers where Dora met important figures of the emerging Irish literary revival. She attended the Dublin School of Art, where W.B. Yeats was a fellow-pupil. She was a major figure of the Irish Literary Revival, publishing many collections of poetry from 1893. Her sister Hester Sigerson Piatt was also a writer. Her friends included Katharine Tynan, Rose Kavanagh and Alice Furlong, writers and poets.

In 1895 she married Clement King Shorter, an English journalist and literary critic. They lived together in London, until her death at age 51 from undisclosed causes. Her friend Katharine Tynan wrote in a biographical sketch that she supposedly ‘died of a broken heart’ after the 1916 executions.

<doc id="1039187" wikidata="Q616848" url="?curid=1039187" title="Perkūnas">
<text>Perkūnas (, , Old Prussian: &quot;Perkūns&quot;, &quot;Perkunos&quot;, Yotvingian: &quot;Parkuns&quot;, Latgalian: &quot;Pārkiuņs&quot;) was the common Baltic god of thunder, and the second most important deity in the Baltic pantheon after Dievas. In both Lithuanian and Latvian mythology, he is documented as the god of sky, thunder, lightning, storms, rain, fire, war, law, order, fertility, mountains, and oak trees.

==Etymology==
The name continues PIE &quot;*&quot;, cognate to &quot;*&quot;, a word for &quot;oak&quot;, &quot;fir&quot; or &quot;wooded mountain&quot;. The Proto-Baltic name *&quot;Perkūnas&quot; can be reconstructed with certainty. Slavic Perun is a related god, but not an etymologically precise match. Finnish Perkele, a name of Ukko, is considered a loan from Baltic.

Another connection is that of &quot;terpikeraunos&quot;, an epithet of Zeus meaning &quot;who enjoys lightning&quot;.

==Perkūnas in written sources==
Most information about Perkūnas comes from folklore songs, legends, and fairy tales. Because most of them were collected rather late in the 19th century, they represent only some fragments of the whole mythology. Lithuanian Perkūnas has many alternative onomatopoeic names, like Dundulis, Dindutis, Dūdų senis, Tarškulis, Tarškutis, Blizgulis, etc.

The earliest attestation of Perkūnas seems to be in the Ruthenian translation of the &quot;Chronicle of John Malalas&quot; (1261) where it speaks about the worship of &quot;Перкоунови рекше громоу&quot;, and in the &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot; (around 1290) which mentions the idol Perkūnė.

In the &quot;Constitutiones Synodales&quot; (1530) Perkūnas is mentioned in a list of gods before the god of hell &quot;Pikuls&quot; and is identified with the Roman Jove (Jupiter). In the &quot;Sudovian Book&quot; Perkūnas (Parkuns) is mentioned in connection with a ritual involving a goat. In Christian compositions, Perkūnas is a malicious spirit, a demon, as in the &quot;Chronicle of John Malalas&quot; or in the 15th century writings of Polish chronicler Jan Długosz.

==Representation in mythology==

Perkūnas is the god of lightning and thunder and storms. In a triad of gods Perkūnas symbolizes the creative forces (including vegetative), courage, success, the top of the world, the sky, rain, thunder, heavenly fire (lightning) and celestial elements, while Potrimpo is involved with the seas, ground, crops, and cereals and Velnias/Patulas, with hell, and death. As a heavenly (atmospheric) deity Perkūnas, apparently, is the assistant and executor of Dievas‘s will. However, Perkūnas tends to surpass Dievas, &quot;deus otiosus&quot;, because he can be actually seen and has defined mythological functions.

In the Latvian &quot;dainas&quot;, the functions of Pērkons and Dievs can occasionally merge: Pērkons is called &quot;Pērkona tēvs&quot; (&#x27;Father or God of Thunder&#x27;) or &quot;Dieviņš&quot;, a diminutive form of &quot;Dievs&quot;.

===Weapons and vehicle===
Perkūnas is pictured as middle-aged, armed with an axe and arrows, riding a two-wheeled chariot harnessed with goats, like Thor or Celtic Taranis.

In other accounts, the thunder god is described as driving a fiery chariot through the skies with swift horses, or riding a fiery horse.

===Perkūnas&#x27; family relations===
In songs about a &quot;heavenly wedding&quot; Saulė (the Sun) cheats on Perkūnas with Mėnulis (the Moon); Perkūnas splits Mėnulis in half with a sword. According to another, more popular, version, Mėnulis cheats on the Sun with Aušrinė (the morning star) just after the wedding, and Perkūnas punishes it. However, it does not learn and repeats the adultery and is punished again every month. Other explanations say it is why the Sun shines during the day and the Moon at night. Though divorced, both want to see their daughter Žemyna (the Earth).

In other songs Perkūnas, on the way to the wedding of Aušra (dawn; the daughter of the Sun), strikes a golden oak. The oak is a tree of the thunder god in the Baltic mythology. References to the &quot;oak of Perkūnas&quot; (in Lithuanian, &quot;Perkūno ąžuolas&quot;; in Latvian, &quot;Pērkona ozols&quot;) exist in a source dated to the first half of the 19th century.

Other myths say that Perkūnas and one Laumė or Vaiva (rainbow) were supposed to get married on Thursday, but the bride was kidnapped by Velnias (the devil) and Perkūnas has hunted Velnias ever since.

Some myths mention four sons of Perkūnas (Latvian: &quot;Perkona dēli&quot;; Lithuanian: &quot;Perkūno sūnūs&quot;), who, apparently, are connected with the four seasons or with the four directions of the world (east, west, south and north). Sometimes there are seven or nine Perkūnai referred to as brothers. It is said in Lithuanian &quot;Perkūnų yra daug&quot; (&quot;there are many thunders&quot;).

In some myths Perkūnas expels his wife (and in some cases his children too) and remains in the sky by himself. Some myths offer a very different story: Dievas lifts Perkūnas from the earth into the sky. Perkūnas has stones in the sky (which rumble during storms) - the motive connected to Indo-European mythology. Perkūnas dwells on high hills or mountains: compare Lithuanian toponymy of Perkūnkalnis, &quot;mountain of Perkūnas&quot;, or Griausmo kalnas, &quot;mountain of rumble.&quot;

In most myths, however, Perkūnas&#x27;s wife is Žemyna.

===Perkūnas and Velnias===

An important function of Perkūnas is to fight Velnias (in Latvian, &quot;Velns&quot;). He is sometimes considered the antithesis of Perkūnas and is the god of the underworld and death. Christianity considers &quot;Velnias&quot; akin to their &quot;devil&quot;, though this is not in line with ancient beliefs.

Perkūnas pursues his opponent, Velns, for picaroon or theft of fertility and cattle. Velnias hides in trees, under stones, or turns into various animals: a black cat, dog, pig, goat, lamb, pike, cow (compare to the Latvian representations of jods a creature with the cow hoofs) or a person.

Perkūnas pursues an opponent in the sky on a chariot, made from stone and fire (Lithuanian &quot;ugnies ratai&quot;). Sometimes the chariot is made from red iron. It is harnessed by a pair (less often four or three) of red and white (or black and white) horses (sometimes goats). Compare the Lithuanian deity of horses and chariots Ratainyčia (Ratainicza mentioned in Lasick&#x27;s works; from Lithuanian &quot;ratai&quot; - &quot;wheel&quot;). It is a mythologized image of a chariot of &quot;Didieji Grįžulo Ratai&quot; (&quot;Grand Wheels of Grįžulas&quot; (Ursa Major). It agrees with Samogitian representations, in which Perkūnas is a horseman on a fiery horse. On his heavenly chariot Perkūnas appears in the shape of a gray-haired old man with a big beard of many colors, in white and black clothes, holding a goat on a cord in one hand and a horn or an axe in the other.

Perkūnas possesses many weapons. They include an axe or sledgehammer, stones, a sword, lightning bolts, a bow and arrows, a club, and an iron or fiery knife. Perkūnas is the creator of the weapons (&quot;Akmeninis kalvis&quot;, &quot;the stone smith&quot;) or he is helped by the heavenly smith Televelis (Kalvelis).

An opponent of Perkūnas hides itself in the hollow of a tree or a stone (attributes of Perkūnas). The culmination of Perkūnas&#x27; hunt for his opponent is a thunder-storm; it not only clears the ground of evil spirits, but returns the stolen cattle or weapons.

Perkūnas is also connected to Thursday. Thursday is the day of the Thunderer in many traditions: compare Polabian &quot;Peräune-dǻn&quot; (&quot;day of Perun&quot;), Lithuanian &quot;Perkūno diena&quot;. Perkūnas is associated with the Roman god Jupiter in early sources. Thursday is a day of thunder-storms and rains, and also of weddings.

==Prussian Perkūns==

Simon Grunau (around 1520) describes a Prussian banner with Perkūns on it. The god is represented as an angry middle aged man with a twisted black beard, topped with a flame. It stands between young Patrimpas and old Patulas. Perkūns maintains the same central position in the description of the sacred oak in Romowe sanctuary. In front of the oak, the eternal fire (symbol of Perkūns) was burned. Special priests served at the sanctuary. Old Prussians would try to appeal to the god by prayers. Perkunatete was the mother of Perkūns.

==Latvian Pērkons==

Pērkons was strongly associated with Dievs, though the two were clearly different. The people sacrificed black calves, goats, and roosters to Pērkons, especially during droughts. The surrounding peoples came to these sacrifices to eat and drink together, after pouring beer onto the ground or into the fire for him. The Latvians also sacrificed cooked food before meals to Pērkons, in order to prevent thunderstorms, during which honeycombs were placed into fires to disperse the clouds.

Pērkons&#x27; family included sons that symbolized various aspects of thunderstorms (such as thunder, lightning, lightning strikes) and daughters that symbolized various kinds of rain.

Pērkons appeared on a golden horse, wielding a sword, iron club, golden whip and a knife. Ancient Latvians wore tiny axes on their clothing in his honor.

==In modern culture==

Perkunas is occasionally mentioned in the novels of Harry Turtledove. He provides an important macguffin in &quot;The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump&quot; (1993) and is the patron god of one of the armies in &quot;Gunpowder Empire&quot; (2003).

Günter Grass, in his second novel &quot;Dog Years&quot; (1963), alludes to Perkūnas (&quot;Perkunos&quot;) as a symbol of the dark human energies unleashed by the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.

The fictional parallel to Nazi Germany in the 1966 alternate history novel &quot;The Gate of Time&quot; by Philip José Farmer - located physically on the site of present day Germany, but dominated by Lithuanians rather than Germans - is called Perkunisha, named after Perkūnas.

Two other alternate history timelines feature a Perkūnas-worshipping Lithuania surviving into the 20th Century, out of diametrically opposing points of divergence. In Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Delenda Est&quot;, the alternate Lithuania arose in a history where Carthage defeated and destroyed Rome and there was no Roman Empire. Conversely, in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Gunpowder Empire&quot;, the Roman Empire survived into the 20th Century and beyond, and &quot;Lietuva&quot; emerged as a rival empire to its north. 

The Lithuanian folk music group Kūlgrinda released a 2003 album titled &quot;Perkūno Giesmės&quot;, meaning &quot;Hymns of Perkūnas&quot;.

&quot;Saule, Pērkons, Daugava&quot; is a Latvian choir song composed by Mārtiņš Brauns, based on a 1916 poem by Rainis.

In August 2023 a tottem pole carved with the writing &quot;Perkunas 2023&quot; appeared above the white cliffs of Dover in the South of England, UK. To date no one has claimed ownership of the piece and the public are still no wiser as to how it got there.

Erica Synths made a drum synthesizer named Perkons.

<doc id="1039191" wikidata="Q3512806" url="?curid=1039191" title="Unicode block">
<text>A Unicode block is one of several contiguous ranges of numeric character codes (code points) of the Unicode character set that are defined by the Unicode Consortium for administrative and documentation purposes. Typically, proposals such as the addition of new glyphs are discussed and evaluated by considering the relevant block or blocks as a whole.

Each block is generally, but not always, meant to supply glyphs used by one or more specific languages, or in some general application area such as mathematics, surveying, decorative typesetting, social forums, etc.

== Design and implementation ==
Unicode blocks are identified by unique names, which use only ASCII characters and are usually descriptive of the nature of the symbols, in English; such as &quot;Tibetan&quot; or &quot;Supplemental Arrows-A&quot;. (When comparing block names, one is supposed to equate uppercase with lowercase letters, and ignore any whitespace, hyphens, and underbars; so the last name is equivalent to &quot;supplemental_arrows__a&quot; and &quot;SUPPLEMENTALARROWSA&quot;.

Blocks are pairwise disjoint; that is, they do not overlap. The starting code point and the size (number of code points) of each block are always multiples of 16; therefore, in the hexadecimal notation, the starting (smallest) point is U+&quot;xxx&quot;0 and the ending (largest) point is U+&quot;yyy&quot;F, where &quot;xxx&quot; and &quot;yyy&quot; are three or more hexadecimal digits. (These constraints are intended to simplify the display of glyphs in Unicode Consortium documents, as tables with 16 rows labeled with the last hexadecimal digit of the code point.) The size of a block may range from the minimum of 16 to a maximum of 65,536 code points.

Every assigned code point has a glyph property called &quot;Block&quot;, whose value is a character string naming the unique block that owns that point. However, a block may also contain unassigned code points, usually reserved for future additions of characters that &quot;logically&quot; should belong to that block. Code points not belonging to any of the named blocks, e.g. in the unassigned planes 4–13, have the value block=&quot;No_Block&quot;.

Simply belonging to a particular Unicode block does not guarantee the certain particular properties of the characters it is or will be expected to contain. The identity of any character is determined by its properties stated in the Unicode Character Database. For example, the contiguous range of 32 noncharacter code points U+FDD0..U+FDEF share none of the properties common to the other characters in the Arabic Presentation Forms-A block, that they are certainly not Arabic script characters or &quot;right-to-left noncharacters&quot;, and are assigned there as a filler to this block given that it has been agreed that no further Arabic compatibility characters will be encoded. 

== Other classifications ==
Each Unicode point also has a property called &quot;General Category&quot;, that attempts to describe the role of the corresponding symbol in the languages or applications for whose sake it was included in the system. Examples of General Categories are &quot;Lu&quot; (meaning upper-case letter), &quot;Nd&quot; (decimal digit), &quot;Pi&quot; (open-quote punctuation), and &quot;Mn&quot; (non-spacing mark, i.e. a diacritic for the preceding glyph). This division is completely independent of code blocks: the code points with a given General Category generally span many blocks, and do not have to be consecutive, not even within each block.

Each code point also has a script property, specifying which writing system it is intended for, or whether it is intended for multiple writing systems. This, also, is independent of block.

In descriptions of the Unicode system, a block may be subdivided into more specific subgroups, such as the &quot;Chess symbols&quot; in the Miscellaneous Symbols block (not to be confused with the separate Chess Symbols block). Those subgroups are not &quot;blocks&quot; in the technical sense used by the Unicode consortium, and are named only for the convenience of users.

== List of blocks ==
Unicode defines 338 blocks:
* 164 in plane 0, the Basic Multilingual Plane (in table below: )
* 161 in plane 1, the Supplementary Multilingual Plane ()
* 7 in plane 2, the Supplementary Ideographic Plane ()
* 2 in plane 3, the Tertiary Ideographic Plane ()
* 2 in plane 14 (E in hexadecimal), the Supplementary Special-purpose Plane ()
* One each in the planes 15 (Fhex) and 16 (10hex), called Supplementary Private Use Area-A and -B ()

== Moved blocks ==
The Unicode Stability Policy requires that a character, once assigned, may not be moved or removed, although it may be deprecated. This applies to Unicode 2.0 and all subsequent versions.

Prior to this, the following former blocks were moved:

<doc id="1039197" wikidata="Q154034" url="?curid=1039197" title="Wespe">
<text>The Sd.Kfz. 124 &quot;Wespe&quot; (German for &quot;wasp&quot;), also known as &quot;Leichte Feldhaubitze 18/2 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II (Sf.)&quot; (&quot;Light field howitzer 18 on Panzer II chassis (self-propelled)&quot;), is a German self-propelled gun developed and used during the Second World War. It was based on a modified Panzer II chassis.

==Development==
During the Battle of France in 1940 it became apparent that the intermediate tank of the German forces, the Panzer II, was unsuitable as a main battle tank. Though mechanically sound, it was both under-gunned and under-armoured. The chassis, however, proved serviceable for providing mobility to the 10.5 cm field howitzer. Existing chassis were converted to self-propelled artillery vehicles, such as the Marder II conversion providing mobility to the PaK 40/7.5 cm anti-tank gun.

The design for the &quot;Wespe&quot; was produced by Alkett, based on the Panzer II &quot;Ausf. F&quot; chassis. Alkett had earlier worked with Alfred Becker to convert captured French armoured vehicles into self-propelled artillery carriers. Among other modifications the Panzer II&#x27;s engine was moved forward and the chassis slightly lengthened to accommodate the rear-mounted 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer. The superstructure was lightly armored, with 10 mm armor plate (enough to stop small arms fire) left open at the top and rear. The vehicles were produced by FAMO&#x27;s Ursus plant in Warsaw.

The &quot;Wespe&quot; was in production from February 1943 until June 1944, when Soviet forces approached the frontier. By that time, 676 had been produced. An additional 159 gun-less Wespe were produced to serve as mobile artillery ammunition carriers.

==Combat history==
The &quot;Wespe&quot; first saw combat in 1943 on the Eastern Front. It proved very successful, and Hitler ordered all Panzer II chassis production be dedicated to the &quot;Wespe&quot; alone, at the expense of other projects, including the Marder II self-propelled anti-tank gun.

The vehicles were allocated to the armored artillery battalions (&quot;Panzerartillerie Abteilungen&quot;) of Panzer divisions along with heavier Hummel self-propelled artillery. The Wespe brought greater mobility to the artillery formations of the panzer divisions.

The Wespe proved reliable and highly maneuverable, but like contemporary self propelled guns such as the British Sexton and U.S. M7 Priest, had inadequate overhead gun crew protection. The Wespe was a considerably smaller target than either of these allied vehicles, but it also held less ammunition given it was based on a smaller chassis chosen based upon availability given limited production capacity for larger ones.

== Surviving vehicles ==
* Deutsches Panzermuseum in Munster, Germany
* Musée des Blindés in Saumur, France
* Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia
* &quot;Memorial Museum of the Battle of Normandy&quot; in Bayeux, France. A Wespe, destroyed in the Falaise Pocket in August 1944, is included in a diorama about the Battle of the Falaise Pocket. 
* Two at the André Becker Collection in Belgium
* A replica, originally made for the movie &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, is displayed at the Sinsheim Auto &amp; Technik Museum.
* Australian Armour and Artillery Museum in Smithfield, Cairns, Queensland, Australia.

<doc id="1039202" wikidata="Q833872" url="?curid=1039202" title="German wine">
<text>German wine is primarily produced in the west of Germany, along the river Rhine and its tributaries, with the oldest plantations going back to the Roman era. Approximately 60 percent of German wine is produced in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, where 6 of the 13 regions (&quot;Anbaugebiete&quot;) for quality wine are situated. Germany has about 104 hectares (252,000 acres or 1,030 square kilometers) of vineyard, which is around one tenth of the vineyard surface in Spain, France or Italy. The total wine production is usually around 10 million hectoliters annually, corresponding to 1.3 billion bottles, which places Germany as the eighth-largest wine-producing country in the world. White wine accounts for almost two thirds of the total production.

As a wine country, Germany has a mixed reputation internationally, with some consumers on the export markets associating Germany with the world&#x27;s most elegant and aromatically pure white wines while other see the country mainly as the source of cheap, mass-market semi-sweet wines such as Liebfraumilch. Among enthusiasts, Germany&#x27;s reputation is primarily based on wines made from the Riesling grape variety, which at its best is used for aromatic, fruity and elegant white wines that range from very crisp and dry to well-balanced, sweet and of enormous aromatic concentration. While primarily a white wine country, red wine production surged in the 1990s and early 2000s, primarily fuelled by domestic demand, and the proportion of the German vineyards devoted to the cultivation of dark-skinned grape varieties has now stabilized at slightly more than a third of the total surface. For the red wines, Spätburgunder, the domestic name for Pinot noir, is in the lead.

==Wine styles==
Germany produces wines in many styles: dry, semi-sweet and sweet white wines, rosé wines, red wines and sparkling wines, called Sekt. (The only wine style not commonly produced is fortified wine.) Due to the northerly location of the German vineyards, the country has produced wines quite unlike any others in Europe, many of outstanding quality. Between the 1950s and the 1980s German wine was known abroad for cheap, sweet or semi-sweet, low-quality mass-produced wines such as Liebfraumilch.

The wines have historically been predominantly white, and the finest made from Riesling. Many wines have been sweet and low in alcohol, light and unoaked. Historically many of the wines (other than late harvest wines) were probably dry (trocken), as techniques to stop fermentation did not exist. Recently much more German white wine is being made in the dry style again. Much of the wine sold in Germany is dry, especially in restaurants. However most exports are still of sweet wines, particularly to the traditional export markets such as the United States, the Netherlands and Great Britain, which are the leading export markets both in terms of volume and value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 24/25&quot;&gt;German Wine Institute, German Wine Statistics 2024–2025 (PDF-file; 700 kB).

Red wine has always been hard to produce in the German climate, and in the past was usually light-colored, closer to rosé or the red wines of Alsace. However recently there has been greatly increased demand and darker, richer red wines (often barrique-aged) are produced from grapes such as Dornfelder and Spätburgunder, the German name for Pinot noir.

Perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of German wines is the high level of acidity in them, caused both by the lesser ripeness in a northerly climate and by the selection of grapes such as Riesling, which retain acidity even at high ripeness levels.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Viticulture in present-day Germany dates back to Ancient Roman times, to sometime from 70 to 270 CE/AD (Agri Decumates). In those days, the western parts of today&#x27;s Germany made up the outpost of the Roman empire against the Germanic tribes on the other side of Rhine. What is generally considered Germany&#x27;s oldest city, Trier, was founded as a Roman garrison and is situated directly on the river Moselle (&quot;Mosel&quot;) in the eponymous wine region. The oldest archeological finds that may indicate early German viticulture are curved pruning knives found in the vicinity of Roman garrisons, dating from the 1st century AD. However, it is not absolutely certain that these knives were used for viticultural purposes. Emperor Probus, whose reign can be dated two centuries later than these knives, is generally considered the founder of German viticulture, but for solid documentation of winemaking on German soil, we must go to around 370 AD, when Ausonius of Bordeaux wrote &quot;Mosella&quot;, where he in enthusiastic terms described the steep vineyards on the river Moselle.

The wild vine, the forerunner of the cultivated &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; is known to have grown on upper Rhine back to historic time, and it is possible (but not documented) that Roman-era German viticulture was started using local varieties. Many viticultural practices were however taken from other parts of the Roman empire, as evidenced by Roman-style trellising systems surviving into the 18th century in some parts of Germany, such as the &quot;Kammertbau&quot; in the Palatinate.

Almost nothing is known of the style or quality of &quot;German&quot; wines that were produced in the Roman era, with the exception of the fact that the poet Venantius Fortunatus mentions red German wine around AD 570.

===From Medieval times to today===

Before the era of Charlemagne, Germanic viticulture was practiced primarily, although not exclusively, on the western side of Rhine. Charlemagne is supposed to have brought viticulture to Rheingau. The eastward spread of viticulture coincided with the spread of Christianity, which was supported by Charlemagne. Thus, in Medieval Germany, churches and monasteries played the most important role in viticulture, and especially in the production of quality wine. Two Rheingau examples illustrate this: archbishop Ruthard of Mainz (reigning 1089–1109) founded a Benedictine abbey on slopes above Geisenheim, the ground of which later became Schloss Johannisberg. His successor Adalbert of Mainz donated land above Hattenheim in 1135 to Cistercians, sent out from Clairvaux in Champagne, who founded Kloster Eberbach.

Many grape varieties commonly associated with German wines have been documented back to the 14th or 15th century. Riesling has been documented from 1435 (close to Rheingau), and Pinot noir from 1318 on Lake Constance under the name &quot;Klebroth&quot;, from 1335 in Affenthal in Baden and from 1470 in Rheingau, where the monks kept a &quot;Clebroit-Wyngart&quot; in Hattenheim. The most grown variety in medieval Germany was however Elbling, with Silvaner also being common, and Muscat, Räuschling and Traminer also being recorded.

For several centuries of the Medieval era, the vineyards of Germany (including Alsace) expanded, and is believed to have reached their greatest extent sometime around 1500, when perhaps as much as four times the present vineyard surface was planted. Basically, the wine regions were located in the same places as today, but more lands around the rivers, and land further upstream Rhine&#x27;s tributaries, was cultivated. The subsequent decline can be attributed to locally produced beer becoming the everyday beverage in northern Germany in the 16th century, leading to a partial loss of market for wine, to the Thirty Years&#x27; War ravaging Germany in the 17th century, to the dissolution of the monasteries, where much of the winemaking know-how was concentrated, in those areas that accepted the Protestant reformation, and to the climatic changes of the Little Ice Age that made viticulture difficult or impossible in marginal areas.

An important event took place in 1775 at Schloss Johannisberg in Rheingau, when the courier delivering the harvest permission was delayed for two weeks, with the result that most of the grapes in Johannisberg&#x27;s Riesling-only vineyard had been affected by noble rot before the harvest began. Unexpectedly, these &quot;rotten grapes&quot; gave a very good sweet wine, which was termed Spätlese, meaning late harvest. From this time, late harvest wines from grapes affected by noble rot have been produced intentionally. The subsequent differentiation of wines based on harvested ripeness, starting with Auslese in 1787, laid the ground for the Prädikat system. These laws, introduced in 1971, define the designations still used today.

At one point the Church controlled most of the major vineyards in Germany. Quality instead of quantity become important and spread quickly down the river Rhine. In the 1800s, Napoleon took control of all the vineyards from the Church, including the best, and divided and secularized them. In 1801, all German states west of the Rhine river were incorporated into the French state. This included the wine regions Ahr, Mosel, Nahe, Rheinhessen, and Pfalz, i.e., the vast majority of German wine production. Since then the Napoleonic inheritance laws in Germany broke up the parcels of vineyards further, leading to the establishment of many cooperatives. However, many notable and world-famous wineries in Germany have managed to acquire or hold enough land to produce wine not only for domestic consumption, but also export. After the battle of Waterloo and Napoleon’s final defeat, the Rhineland (which encompasses the viticultural regions Mosel, Mittelrhein, Nahe and Ahr) fell to Prussia, while the Palatinate (Pfalz) fell to Bavaria. Hesse Darmstadt received what is today known as Rheinhessen. Many of the best vineyards were transferred to the new states, where they were wrapped up as state domains.

Custom-free access to the vast Prussian markets in the east and the growing industrial clusters on the Ruhr and protection from non-Prussian competitors, including from southern German regions such Baden, Württemberg, Palatinate and Rheinhessen, fostered Mosel, Rhine, Nahe and Ahr winemakers, due to high tariff barriers for all other producers.

==Geography and climate==
The German wine regions are some of the most northerly in the world. The main wine-producing climate lies below the 50th parallel, which runs through the regions Rheingau and Mosel. Above this line the climate becomes less conducive to wine production, but there are still some vineyards above this line and the effects of climate change on wine production are growing.

Because of the northerly climate, there has been a search for suitable grape varieties (particularly frost resistant and early harvesting ones), and many crosses have been developed, such as Müller-Thurgau in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute. Since several years ago there has been an increase in plantings of Riesling as local and international demand has been demanding high quality wines.

The wines are all produced around rivers, mainly the Rhine and its tributaries, often sheltered by mountains. The rivers have significant microclimate effects to moderate the temperature. The soil is slate in the steep valleys, to absorb the sun&#x27;s heat and retain it overnight. On the rolling hills the soil is lime and clay dominated. The great sites are often extremely steep so they catch the most sunlight, but they are difficult to harvest mechanically. The slopes are also positioned facing the south or south-west to angle towards the sun.

The vineyards are extremely small compared to New World vineyards and wine making is dominated by craft rather than industry wines. This makes the lists of wines produced long and complex, and many wines hard to obtain as production is so limited.

==Regions==
The wine regions in Germany usually referred to are the 13 defined regions for quality wine. The German wine industry has organised itself around these regions and their division into districts. However, there are also a number of regions for the insignificant table wine (&quot;Tafelwein&quot;) and country wine (&quot;Landwein&quot;) categories. Those regions with a few exceptions overlap with the quality wine regions. To make a clear distinction between the quality levels, the regions and subregions for different quality levels have different names on purpose, even when they are allowed to be produced in the same geographical area.

=== German wine regions ===

There are 13 defined regions (&quot;Anbaugebiete&quot;) in Germany:

# Ahr – a small region along the river Ahr, a tributary of Rhine, that despite its northernly location primarily produces red wine from Spätburgunder.
# Baden – Germany&#x27;s southernmost, warmest and sunniest winegrowing region, in Germany&#x27;s southwestern corner, across river Rhine from Alsace, and the only German wine region situated in European Union wine growing zone B rather than A, which results in higher minimum required maturity of grapes and less chaptalisation allowed. Most of the land is cultivated with Pinot family. That include Pinot Noir (Spätburgunder), Pinot Gris (Grauburgunder) and Pinot Blanc (Weissburgunder).
# The Kaiserstuhl region in the winegrowing region of Baden is Germany&#x27;s warmest location. One of two wine regions in the state of Baden-Württemberg.
# Franconia or &quot;Franken&quot; – around portions of Main river, and the only wine region situated in Bavaria. Noted for growing many varieties on chalky soil and for producing powerful dry Silvaner wines. In Germany, only Franconia and certain small parts of the Baden region are allowed to use the distinctive flattened Bocksbeutel bottle shape.
# Hessische Bergstraße (Hessian Mountain Road) – a small region in the state Hesse dominated by Riesling.
# Mittelrhein – along the middle portions of river Rhine, primarily between the regions Rheingau and Mosel, and dominated by Riesling.
# Mosel – along the river Moselle (&quot;Mosel&quot;) and its tributaries, the rivers Saar and Ruwer, and was previously known as &quot;Mosel-Saar-Ruwer&quot;. The Mosel region is dominated by Riesling grapes and slate soils, and the best wines are grown in dramatic-looking steep vineyards directly overlooking the rivers. This region produces wine that is light in body due to lower alcohol levels, crisp, of high acidity and with pronounced mineral character. The only region to stick to Riesling wine with noticeable residual sweetness as the &quot;standard&quot; style, although dry wines are also produced.
# Nahe – around the river Nahe where volcanic origins give very varied soils. Mixed grape varieties but the best-known producers primarily grow Riesling, and some of them have achieved world reputation in recent years.
# Palatinate or &quot;Pfalz&quot; – the second largest producing region in Germany, with production of very varied styles of wine (especially in the southern half), where red wine has been on the increase. The northern half of the region is home to many well-known Riesling producers with a long history, which specialize in powerful Riesling wines in a dry style. Until 1995, it was known in German as &quot;Rheinpfalz&quot;.
# Rheingau – a small region at a bend in the Rhine that provide excellent conditions for winegrowing. The oldest documented references to Riesling come from the Rheingau region and it is the region where many German winemaking practices have originated, such as the use of &quot;Prädikat&quot; designations. Dominated by Riesling with some Spätburgunder. The Rheingau Riesling style is in-between Mosel and the Palatinate and other southern regions, and at its finest combines the best aspects of both.
# Rheinhessen or Rhenish Hesse – the largest production area in Germany. Once known as Liebfraumilch land, but a quality revolution has taken place since the 1990s. Mixed wine styles and both red and white wines. The best Riesling wines are similar to Palatinate Riesling – dry and powerful. Despite its name, it lies in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, not in Hesse.
# Saale-Unstrut – one of two regions in former East Germany along the rivers Saale and Unstrut, and Germany&#x27;s northernmost winegrowing region.
# Saxony or &quot;Sachsen&quot; – one of two regions in former East Germany, in the southeastern corner of the country, along the river Elbe in the state of Saxony.
# Württemberg – a traditional red wine region, where grape varieties Trollinger (the region&#x27;s signature variety), Schwarzriesling and Lemberger outnumber the varieties that dominate elsewhere. One of two wine regions in the state of Baden-Württemberg.

These 13 regions (&quot;Anbaugebiete&quot;) are broken down into 39 districts (&quot;Bereiche&quot;) which are further broken down into collective vineyard sites (&quot;Großlagen&quot;) of which there are 167. The individual vineyard sites (&quot;Einzellagen&quot;) number 2,658.

=== Sorted by size ===
Data from 2023.

===Tafelwein and Landwein regions===

There are seven regions for Tafelwein (&quot;Weinbaugebiete für Tafelwein&quot;), three of which are divided into two or three subregions (&quot;Untergebiete&quot;) each, and 21 regions for Landwein (&quot;Landweingebiete&quot;). These regions have the following relationship to each other, and to the quality wine regions:

==Grape varieties==
Overall nearly 135 grape varieties may be cultivated in Germany – 100 are released for white wine production and 35 for red wine production. According to the international image, Germany is still considered a region for white wine production. Since the 1980s, demand for German red wine has constantly increased, and this has resulted in a doubling of the vineyards used for red wine. Nowadays, over 35% of the vineyards are cultivated with red grapes. Some of the red grapes are also used to produce rosé.

Out of all the grape varieties listed below, only 20 have a significant market share.

===Grape variety trends over time===

During the last century several changes have taken place with respect to the most planted varieties. Until the early 20th century, Elbling was Germany&#x27;s most planted variety, after which it was eclipsed by Silvaner during the middle of the 20th century. After a few decades in the top spot, in the late 1960s Silvaner was overtaken by the high-yielding Müller-Thurgau, which in turn started to lose ground in the 1980s. From the mid-1990s, Riesling became the most planted variety, a position it probably had never enjoyed before on a national level. Red grapes in Germany have experienced several ups and downs. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there was a downward trend, which was reversed around 1980. From mid-1990s and during the next decade, there was an almost explosive growth of plantation of red varieties. Plantings was shared between traditional Spätburgunder and a number of new crossings, led by Dornfelder, while other traditional German red varieties such as Portugieser only held their ground. From around 2005, the proportion of red varieties has stabilized around 37%, about three times the 1980 level.

===Common white wine grapes===
White grape varieties account for 66% of the area planted in Germany. Principal varieties are listed below; there are larger numbers of less important varieties too.
* Riesling is the benchmark grape in Germany and covers the most area in German vineyards. It is an aromatic variety with a high level of acidity that can be used for dry, semi-sweet, sweet and sparkling wines. The drawback to Riesling is that it takes 130 days to ripen and, in marginal years, the Riesling crop tends to be poor.
* Müller-Thurgau is an alternative grape to Riesling that growers have been using, and is one of the so-called &quot;new crossings&quot;. Unlike the long ripening time of Riesling, this grape variety only requires 100 days to ripen, can be planted on more sites, and is higher yielding. However, this grape has a more neutral flavour than Riesling, and as the main ingredient of Liebfraumilch its reputation has taken a beating together with that wine variety. Germany&#x27;s most planted variety from the 1970s to the mid-1990s, it has been losing ground for a number of years. Dry Müller-Thurgau is usually labeled Rivaner.
* Grauer Burgunder or Ruländer (Pinot gris)
* Weisser Burgunder (Pinot blanc)
* Silvaner is another subtle, fairly neutral, but quite old grape variety that was Germany&#x27;s most planted until the 1960s and after that has continued to lose ground. It has however remained popular in Franconia and Rheinhessen, where it is grown on chalky soils to produce powerful dry wines with a slightly earthy and rustic but also food-friendly character.
* Chardonnay
* Kerner
* Sauvignon blanc
* Bacchus
* Scheurebe

===Common red wine grapes===
Red wine varieties account for 34% of the plantations in Germany but has increased in recent years.
* Spätburgunder (Pinot noir) – a much-appreciated grape variety that demands good sites to produce good wines and therefore competes with Riesling. It is considered to give the most elegant red wines of Germany.
* Dornfelder – a &quot;new crossing&quot; that has become much appreciated in Germany since it is easy to grow and gives dark-coloured, full-bodied, fruity and tannic wines of a style that used to be hard to produce in Germany.
* Portugieser
* Trollinger
* Lemberger (Blaufränkisch)
* Schwarzriesling (Pinot Meunier)
* Regent
* Merlot
* St. Laurent

===Permitted varieties===
According to the German wine law, the state governments are responsible for drawing up lists of grape varieties allowed in wine production. The varieties listed below are officially permitted for commercial cultivation. The lists include varieties permitted only for selected experimental cultivation.

==Viticultural practices==

Many of the best vineyards in Germany are steep vineyards overlooking rivers, where mechanisation is impossible and a lot of manual labour is needed to produce the wine.

Since it can be difficult to get ripe grapes in such a northernly location as Germany, the sugar maturity of grapes (must weight) as measured by the Oechsle scale have played a great role in Germany.

German vintners on average crop their vineyards quite high, with yields averaging around 64–99 hl/ha, a high figure in international comparison. Some crossings used for low-quality white wine yield up to 150–200 hl/ha, while quality-conscious producers who strive to produce well-balanced wines of concentrated flavours rarely exceed 50 hl/ha.

Many wines in Germany are produced using organic farming or biodynamic methods. With an average annual growth rate of 25 percent and a cultivated area of more than 7,000 hectares, Germany ranks in place six worldwide. The market share of organic wine is between four and five percent.

==Winemaking practices==
Chaptalization is allowed only up to the QbA level, not for &quot;Prädikatswein&quot; and all wines must be fermented dry if chaptalised. To balance the wine, unfermented grape juice, called Süssreserve, may be added after fermentation.

==Classification==

German wine classification is sometimes the source of confusion. However, to those familiar with the terms used, a German wine label reveals much information about the wine&#x27;s origin, the minimum ripeness of the grapes used for the wine, as well as the dryness/sweetness of the wine.

In general, the ripeness classifications of German wines reflect minimum sugar content in the grape (also known as &quot;potential alcohol&quot; = the amount of alcohol resulting from fermenting all sugar in the juice) at the point of harvest of the grape. They have nothing to do with the sweetness of the wine after fermentation, which is one of the most common mis-perceptions about German wines.

* Deutscher Tafelwein (German table wine) is mostly consumed in the country and not exported. Generally used for blended wines that can not be Qualitätswein.
* Deutscher Landwein (German country wine) comes from a larger designation and again doesn&#x27;t play an important role in the export market.
* Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA) wines from a defined appellation with the exception of Liebfraumilch, which can be blended from several regions and still be classified as Qualitätswein.
* Prädikatswein, recently (August 1, 2007) renamed from Qualitätswein mit Prädikat (QmP) wines made from grapes of higher ripeness. As ripeness increases, the fruit characteristics and price increase. Categories within Prädikatswein are Kabinett, Spätlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein. Wines of these categories can not be chaptalized. All these categories within Prädikatswein are solely linked to minimum requirements of potential alcohol. While these may correlate with harvest time, there are no legally defined harvest time restrictions anymore.
** Kabinett wines are made from grapes that have achieved minimum defined potential alcohol levels. Those minimum requirements differ by region and grape variety. Essentially, Kabinett is the first level of reserve grape selection.
** Spätlese wines (&quot;late harvest&quot;) are made from grapes that have achieved minimum defined potential alcohol levels. Those minimum requirements differ by region and grape variety. Essentially, Spatlese is the second level of reserve grape selection.
** Auslese wines (&quot;select harvest&quot;) are made from grapes that have achieved minimum defined potential alcohol levels. Those minimum requirements differ by region and grape variety. Essentially, Auslese is the third level of reserve grape selection.
** Beerenauslese wines (&quot;berry selection&quot;) are made from grapes that have achieved minimum defined potential alcohol levels. The concentration of the grape juice may have been facilitated by a fungus &quot;Botrytis&quot;, which perforates the skin of the grape forcing water to drip out and all remaining elements to concentrate. Due to the high potential alcohol level required for this category of ripeness, these wines are generally made into sweet wines and can make good dessert wines.
** Trockenbeerenauslese wines (&quot;dry berries selection&quot;) are made from grapes of an even higher potential alcohol level, generally reachable only with the help of Botrytis. The grapes used for Trockenbeerenauslese have reached an even more raisin-like state than those used for Beerenauslese. Due to the high concentration of sugar in the raisin-like grape, these wines can only be made in a sweet style and make extremely sweet, concentrated and usually quite expensive wines.
** Eiswein (ice wine) wine is made grapes that freeze naturally on the vine and have to reach the same potential alcohol level as Beerenauslese. The grapes are harvested and pressed in the frozen state. The ice stays in the press during pressing and hence a concentrated juice flows off the press leading to higher potential alcohol levels, which in turn generally result in sweet wines due to the high potential alcohol. The taste differs from the other high-level wines since Botrytis infection is usually lower, ideally completely absent.

On wine labels, German wine may be classified according to the residual sugar of the wine. Trocken refers to dry wine. These wines have less than 9 grams/liter of residual sugar. Halbtrocken wines are off-dry and have 9–18 grams/liter of residual sugar. Due to the high acidity (&quot;crispness&quot;) of many German wines, the taste profile of many halbtrocken wines fall within the &quot;internationally dry&quot; spectrum rather than being appreciably sweet. Feinherb wines are slightly more sweet than halbtrocken wines. Lieblich wines are noticeably sweet; except for the high category Prädikatsweine of type Beerenauslese and above, lieblich wines from Germany are usually of the low Tafelwein category. The number of German wines produced in a lieblich style has dropped markedly since the style went out of fashion in the 1980s.

In recent years, the Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter (VDP), which is a private marketing club founded in 1910, has lobbied for the recognition of a vineyard classification, but its effort have not yet changed national law.

There are also several terms to identify the grower and producers of the wine:

* Weingut refers to a winegrowing and wine-producing estate, rather craft than industry.
* Weinkellerei refers to a maturing and bottling facility, a bottler or shipper.
* Winzergenossenschaft refers to a winemaking cooperative.
* Gutsabfüllung refers to a grower/producer wine that is estate bottled.
* Abfüller refers to a bottler or shipper.

==Industry structure==
The German wine scene consists of many small craft oriented vineyard owners. The 2023 viticultural survey counted 14.150 vineyard owners, down from 76 683 in Western Germany in 1989/90. Most of the 2.570 operators of less than 0.5 ha should likely be classified as hobby winemakers. Two digit decreases of operating owners change the structure. Many smaller vineyard owners do not pursue viticulture as a full-time occupation, but rather as a supplement to other agriculture or to hospitality. It is not uncommon for a visitor to a German wine region to find that a small family-owned &quot;Gasthaus&quot; has its own wine. Smaller grape-growers who do not wish to, or are unable to, commercialise their own wine have several options available: sell the grapes (either on the market each harvest year, or on long-term contract with larger wineries looking to supplement their own production), deliver the grapes to a winemaking cooperative (called &quot;Winzergenossenschaft&quot; in Germany), or sell the wine in bulk to winemaking firms that use them in &quot;bulk brands&quot; or as a base wine for Sekt. Those who own vineyards in truly good locations also have the option of renting them out to larger producers to operate.

A total of 5,864 vineyard owners owned more than 5 ha each in 2016, accounting for 81% of Germany&#x27;s total vineyard surface, and it is in this category that the full-time vintners and commercial operations are primarily found. However, truly large wineries, in terms of their own vineyard holdings, are rare in Germany. Hardly any German wineries reach the size of New World winemaking companies, and only a few are of the same size as a typical Bordeaux Grand Cru Classé château. Of the ten wineries considered as Germany&#x27;s best by &quot;Gault Millau Weinguide&quot; in 2007, nine had 10,2 — 19 ha of vineyards, and one (Weingut Robert Weil, owned by Suntory) had 70 ha. This means that most of the high-ranking German wineries each only produces around 100,000 bottles of wine per year. That production is often distributed over, say, 10–25 different wines from different vineyards, of different &quot;Prädikat&quot;, sweetness and so on. The largest vineyard owner is the Hessian State Wineries (&quot;Hessische Staatsweingüter&quot;), owned by the state of Hesse, with 200 ha vineyards, the produce of which is vinified in three separate wineries. The largest privately held winery is Dr. Bürklin-Wolf in the Palatinate with 85,5 ha.

=== Largest German wineries ===
By April 2014, the ten largest German wine producers were:

* Weingut Lergenmüller Hainfeld (Palatinate), 110 ha; and Schloss Reinhartshausen, 80 ha
* Juliusspital, Würzburg (Franken), 170 ha
* Weingut Heinz Pfaffmann, Walsheim (Palatinate), 150 ha
* Hessische Staatsweingüter Eltville (Rheingau), 140 ha

<doc id="1039207" wikidata="Q212209" url="?curid=1039207" title="Mjøsa">
<text>Mjøsa is the largest lake in Norway and the fourth deepest in Norway and Europe. It is located in the southern part of Norway, about north of the city of Oslo. Its main tributary is the river Gudbrandsdalslågen flowing in from the north; the only distributary is the river Vorma in the south. Inflows would theoretically need 5.6 years to fill the lake. With an average depth of about , most of the lake&#x27;s volume is under sea level. The average outflow of the lake (measured from 1931 to 1982) is which is about . Mjøsa contains about of water compared to the in the lake Røssvatnet, the second largest lake by volume in Norway.

With a surface elevation of about , the depth of Mjøsa means that the deepest part of the basin is located approximately below sea level. This is lower than the deepest point of the sea inlet of Kattegat and the lower than the vast majority of Skagerrak off Norway&#x27;s south coast. Mjøsa retains a larger average depth than both the North Sea and Baltic Sea respectively.

Thomas Robert Malthus traveled through Norway in 1799 and his diaries from the trip includes a description of Mjøsa. Malthus wrote that Mjøsa appears as both lake and river because the shores are defined by mountains and where the valley becomes wider the water fills the space. Below Minde (Minnesund) the lake only appears like a river and is called Vorma on the map, according to Malthus.

==Location==

From its southernmost point at Minnesund in Eidsvoll to its northernmost point in Lillehammer it is long. At its widest, near the town of Hamar, it is wide. It is in area and its volume is estimated at ; normally its surface is about above sea level, and its greatest depth is . Its total coastline is estimated at , of which 30% is built up. Dams built on the distributary of Vorma in 1858, 1911, 1947, and 1965 raised the level by approximately in 
total. During the 19th and 20th centuries, there have been 20 floods recorded that added at least to the level of the lake which caused flooding. Several of these floods inundated the city of Hamar.

The towns of Hamar, Gjøvik, and Lillehammer were founded along the shores of the lake. Before the construction of railways past the lake, it was an important transport route. Today, aside from minor leisure boating and the steamship &quot;Skibladner&quot;, there is no water traffic on the lake. Most of its shores are dominated by rolling agricultural areas, among them some of the most fertile grainlands in Norway. The main train line, the Dovre Line between Oslo and Trondheim, goes along its eastern shore, making stops at Hamar Station and Lillehammer Station. From the south, the European route E6 highway runs along the eastern shore of the lake until the Mjøsa Bridge connects Moelv on the east with Biri on the west.

==Mjøskastellet==

The largest and only island in the lake is Helgøya. Except for Helgøya, Mjøsa only contains small islets. The most interesting of these is Steinsholmen, which holds the ruins of Mjøskastellet, a medieval citadel dating from the 13th century. Established by King Haakon IV of Norway, it was first mentioned historically in a letter dated 1234. Peter Andreas Blix documented the site and made drawings in 1897. Hedmark Museum has a future archaeological plan for the site.

==Fish==
Lake Mjøsa has 20 species of fish. Among the most common are pike, European perch, common roach, greyling, and the hundertrout, a brown trout which can reach a weight more than . Another common species is the European smelt, which is the most important bait fish for the predators. Historically, the most economically significant species is the &quot;lågsild&quot; (European cisco).

== Source of drinking water ==
Several municipal and urban areas use the lake as their source of drinking water.
*Hamar / Ottestad – Hias IKS has responsibility for the waterworks and waste water treatment plants in Hamar Municipality, Stange Municipality, and Løten Municipality.
*Lillehammer –  Operates waterworks at Korgen. Contracts have been signed for a new flood-proof waterworks to be built in Hovemoen.
*Gjøvik – WWTP run from Rambekk Renseanlegg
*Østre Toten – Kapp / Skreia
*Brumunddal – Biri / Moelv

==Name==
The lake is named &quot;Mjøsa&quot; ( / Proto-Norse &quot;*Merso&quot;) and this name must be very old. The meaning is possibly &quot;the bright/shiny one&quot;. This is based on the theory that the first element &quot;*mer-&quot; is related to the English word &quot;mere&quot; which means &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;-so&quot; is a suffix.

==Events==
From 1932 to 1934, ice racing was held on the lake&#x27;s northern reaches near Lillehammer. Warmer winters had forced race organisers to move racing from Gjersjøen near Oslo. The Norwegian Grand Prix was held there in 1934. The race was won by Swedish driver Per-Viktor Widengren in an Alfa Romeo 8C but poor attendance saw the Grand Prix move back to the Oslo region in 1935.

In 1975, the 14th World Scout Jamboree was held on its shores. More than 17,000 Scouts from 91 countries took part.

In 1995, a Canadian historic aircraft organization named Halifax 57 Rescue recovered a mostly intact Handley Page Halifax bomber from it, which was previously discovered in 1991 to be resting at a depth of 750 feet (228.6 m). The aircraft, NA337, was shot down at 0131 hours on 24 April 1945 while returning from a supply mission and crashed shortly after. It was later restored extensively to its original state (albeit non – flying) and is now one of only three remaining examples of the type anywhere in the world.

==Culture projects==
The inter-county public art collaboration project, is a model for inter-organizational cooperation and collaboration between local municipalities and counties. It is a public &quot;land-art&quot; project that was supported by the Oppland County Municipality and Hedmark County Municipality as well as local municipalities of Eidsvoll, Gjøvik, Hamar, Lillehammer, Ringsaker, Stange, and Østre Toten. These communities all share shoreline with Mjøsa. &quot;Det Var Jo Ingen Horizont Der,&quot; is an environmental art collaboration including the works of 12 artists&#x27; sculptural and multimedia environmental artworks installed at 20 geographic places on and around the shores of Mjøsa. The project is documented in a book and it was part of an exhibition at the Mjøsmuseet (museum) in 2019.

<text>Belver is a Portuguese civil parish in the municipality of Gavião, district of Portalegre. The population in 2011 was 684, in an area of 69.84 km2. It is situated along the northern bank of the Tagus River.

==History==

On 13 June 1194, the region of Belver was donated by King Sancho I of Portugal to the Knights Hospitaller, with the condition that the knights were required to build a castle in the site.

Between 1383 and 1385, Belver aligned itself with the forces of Leonor Telles de Menezes against the Master of Avis.

In the 16th century, the parochial church was constructed. On 18 May 1518, King Manuel I of Portugal conceded a foral (&quot;charter&quot;) to Belver.

In the 17th century, the village was surveyed by Pedro Nunes Tinoco, and determined to be under the authority of the Priory of Crato.

In 1836, the municipality of Belver was extinguished and the region was integrated into the municipality of Mação. This remained in effect until the end of the century, when in 1898 it was integrated into the municipality of Gavião.

In 1905 a bridge was completed over the &quot;Ribeira de Belver&quot;.

==Geography==
Belver is the northernmost civil parish of the municipality, and the only on the northern margin of the Tagus River (the remaining parishes of Gavião are on lands south of the Tagus). It is bordered by Gavião and Atalaia parishes (in the south), while surrounded by the parishes of Envendos, Mação and Ortiga (in the neighbouring municipality of Mação) to the northeast, north and northwest, respectively. It is located from the urban centre of Gavião along the left margin of the Tagus.

The parish is situated in river valley, from the right margin of the Tagus River, along the confluence of the &quot;Ribeira de Belver&quot;. Its highest elevation is occupied by the hilltop surmounted by the Castle of Belver, while the urban area is above sea level. Surrounding these hilltops are several olive orchards.

It is accessible by rail-link (the Beira Baixa railway), with its stop in the city centre. Alternatively, the main access is along the A23/IP6/E806 motorway (&quot;Auto-Estrada da Beira-Interior&quot;), passing through the northern part of the parish, then south to the Tagus basin.

<text>Holmefjord is a village in the municipality of Bjørnafjorden in Vestland county, Norway. It is located near the shore along the Samnangerfjorden about northwest of the village of Eikelandsosen.

Holmefjord is a small typical western Norwegian village. In 1960, there were 2 general stores, a dairy, and a local bakery. Due to a contemporary transportation system and lifestyle (as of 2006), most of that is gone and there is only one general store left. There are a few small industrial factories that use wood as raw materials, producing wooden beams as well as other things. The traditional handicraft of making barrels out of pine is now almost extinct. These barrels were used for storage of herring as well as exported to Canada and Iceland.

The village has a tradition (for about the last 100 years or so) of having a play every May 17. Most villagers have participated in the play over the years. On May 17, the villagers work together and make a lot of a popular local porridge, called &quot;raudravle&quot;, which is sold for the benefit of the community house, Bygdaheimen.

From 1995 to 1996, she was a vice-president of the World Bank and chief of staff to the President of the World Bank. From 1996 to 2003 she was in turns permanent secretary at four government departments. She was permanent secretary at the Welsh Office from 1996 to 1999, where she oversaw the setting up of the National Assembly for Wales. Afterwards, from 1999 to 2002, Lomax was permanent secretary of the Department of Social Security and then from 2001 its successor, the Department for Work and Pensions. Then in 2002–2003 Lomax served as Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport, having moved there with her Secretary of State Alistair Darling when prime minister Tony Blair reshuffled his cabinet following the resignation—in highly charged and controversial circumstances—of the Secretary of State for Transport Stephen Byers.

From 2003 to 2008 she was a deputy governor at the Bank of England, serving on its Monetary Policy Committee, where she was &quot;one of the more moderate, centrist figures&quot;. She left &quot;just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008&quot; reportedly to &quot;pursue other interests&quot;.

In December 2008, she became an independent non-executive director of HSBC Holdings, where she is also a member of the audit and risk committees. In December 2010 she joined BAA (now Heathrow Airport Holdings) as a non-executive director, and she is also a non-executive director of Serco, and a trustee of Imperial College London, and has served as President of the Institute of Fiscal Studies.

==Personal life==

Lomax is on the Board of the Royal National Theatre and of De Montfort University in Leicester. In June 2007 she received an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow.

She married Michael Acworth Lomax in 1967; they divorced in 1990. The couple has two sons and now have 4 granddaughters.

<text>The Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging (ATSUI) is the set of services for rendering Unicode-encoded text introduced in Mac OS 8.5 and carried forward into Mac OS X.

It replaced the WorldScript engine for legacy encodings.

== Obsolescence ==

ATSUI was replaced by a faster and modern Unicode imaging engine called Core Text in Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).

It was officially deprecated with Xcode 4.6, which was released in December 2012: &quot;Source code using ATS APIs will generate warnings while being compiled. For 10.8, there will be no loss of functionality but there could be areas where performance will suffer. Programmers are instructed to replace all their ATS code (including ATSUI) with CoreText as ATS functionality will be completely removed in future releases of OS X.&quot;

ATSUI was removed in September 2022 for source code targeting only macOS 13 Ventura, and is completely removed in macOS 14 Sonoma.

<doc id="1039260" wikidata="Q996437" url="?curid=1039260" title="HOMFLY polynomial">
<text>In the mathematical field of knot theory, the HOMFLY polynomial or HOMFLYPT polynomial, sometimes called the generalized Jones polynomial, is a 2-variable knot polynomial, i.e. a knot invariant in the form of a polynomial of variables &quot;m&quot; and &quot;l&quot;. 

A central question in the mathematical theory of knots is whether two knot diagrams represent the same knot. One tool used to answer such questions is a knot polynomial, which is computed from a diagram of the knot and can be shown to be an invariant of the knot, i.e. diagrams representing the same knot have the same polynomial. The converse may not be true. The HOMFLY polynomial is one such invariant and it generalizes two polynomials previously discovered, the Alexander polynomial and the Jones polynomial, both of which can be obtained by appropriate substitutions from HOMFLY. The HOMFLY polynomial is also a quantum invariant.

The name &quot;HOMFLY&quot; combines the initials of its co-discoverers: Jim Hoste, Adrian Ocneanu, Kenneth Millett, Peter J. Freyd, W. B. R. Lickorish, and David N. Yetter. The addition of &quot;PT&quot; recognizes independent work carried out by Józef H. Przytycki and Paweł Traczyk.

==Definition==
The polynomial is defined using skein relations:

: formula_1

: formula_2

where formula_3 are links formed by crossing and smoothing changes on a local region of a link diagram, as indicated in the figure. 

The HOMFLY polynomial of a link &quot;L&quot; that is a split union of two links formula_4 and formula_5 is given by

: formula_6

See the page on skein relation for an example of a computation using such relations.

==Other HOMFLY skein relations==
This polynomial can be obtained also using other skein relations:
: formula_7
: formula_8

==Main properties==
: formula_9, where # denotes the knot sum; thus the HOMFLY polynomial of a composite knot is the product of the HOMFLY polynomials of its components.

: formula_10, so the HOMFLY polynomial can often be used to distinguish between two knots of different chirality. However there exist chiral pairs of knots that have the same HOMFLY polynomial, e.g. knots 942 and 1071 together with their respective mirror images.

The Jones polynomial, &quot;V&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), and the Alexander polynomial, formula_11 can be computed in terms of the HOMFLY polynomial (the version in formula_12 and formula_13 variables) as follows:
: formula_14

: formula_15

<doc id="1039267" wikidata="Q1052888" url="?curid=1039267" title="Codrus">
<text>Codrus (; ; Greek: , &quot;Kódros&quot;) was the last of the semi-mythical Kings of Athens (r. ca 1089–1068 BC). He was an ancient exemplar of patriotism and self-sacrifice. He was succeeded by his son Medon, who it is claimed ruled not as king but as the first Archon of Athens. He was said to have traced his descent to the sea-God Poseidon through his father Melanthus.

The earliest version of the story of Codrus comes from the 4th oration &quot;Against Leocrates&quot; by Lycurgus of Athens. During the time of the Dorian Invasion of Peloponnesus (c. 1068 BC), the Dorians under Aletes, son of Hippotes, had consulted the Delphic Oracle, who prophesied that their invasion would succeed as long as the king was not harmed. The news of this prophecy, that only the death of an Athenian king would ensure the safety of Athens, quickly found its way to the ears of the king. Knowing Athens would fall to the foreign war tribe otherwise, after conquering most of Greece up to this point; for the love of his people, King Codrus sacrificed himself to save them. 

Disguised as a peasant, he made it to the vicinity of the Dorian encampment across the river, where he provoked a group of Dorian soldiers. He was put to death in the quarrel, and the Dorians, realizing Codrus had been slain, decided to retreat in fear of their prophesied defeat. In the aftermath of these events, it was claimed that no one thought himself worthy to succeed Codrus and so the title of king was abolished, and that of archon substituted for it.

Aristotle (or possibly one of his students), in the &quot;Constitution of the Athenians&quot;, states that it was indeed the house of Codrus that abolished the title of king in favor of Archon, eventually followed by 11 more.

<text>Berzo Demo (Camunian: ) is an Italian comune in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, in Lombardy, northern Italy.

==Geography==
The town of Berzo Demo is nestled on the southern slopes of the Pian della Regina. It is formed by three villages: the more downstream is Demo, the central one is Berzo and on top is Monte. It is bounded by other communes of Cedegolo, Cevo, Malonno, Paisco Loveno, Sellero, Sonico.

==History==


Monday 6 April 1299, the consuls of the vicinia of Berzo and Demo go to Cemmo where is Cazoino Capriolo, Chamberlain of the Bishop of Brescia Berardo Maggi. Here swear according to the usual formula loyalty to the bishop, and pay the tithe due.
On 15 May 1365 the Bishop of Brescia Enrico Sessa invests iure feuds for a tenth of the rights in the territories of Breno, Vione, Vezza, Sonico, Malonno, Berzo Demo, Astrio, Ossimo and Losine Giovanni and Gerardo sons of Pasino Federici of Mu.

The peace of Breno of 31 December 1397, the representatives of the community of Demo, Albertino di Martino di Demo and the notary Giovannino Boldrini of Saviore, stands on the Ghibelline bank of Oglio.

On 17 September 1423 the Bishop of Brescia Francesco Marerio invests iure feuds for a 10th of the rights in the territories of Monno, Cevo, Andrist, Grumello, Saviore, Cemmo, Ono, Sonico, Astri, Malegno, Cortenedolo, Vione, Incudine and Berzo Demo at Bertolino della Torre of Cemmo.

In 1760 Berzo Demo and Monte had 790 inhabitants.

Between 1927 and 1948 (Royal Decree 28 September 1927) Berzo Demo was joint to Cedegolo.

==Main sights==
The churches of Berzo Demo are:
* Berzo
** Parish Church of St. Eusebius, fifteenth century in origin, extended in the seventeenth. The ancon of the high altar was made by Pietro Ramus. 
* Demo
** Parish of San Lorenzo; the portal bears the date 1757
** Church of St. Augustine, near the bell tower, now deconsecrated. Within a tombstone dated 1640.
** Church of San Zeno, on a small hill at the foot of the commune, is of the sixteenth century. It has a triangular tower-bell.
** Church dedicated to Saint Valentine (or &quot;of the Dead&quot;): Until a few years ago it was covered with votive offerings (ex voto), especially anatomical ones (legs, feet, hands). 
*The bell tower of 1865 stands on the ruins of a medieval tower-house

==Culture==
The scütüm are in camunian dialect nicknames, sometimes personal, elsewhere showing the characteristic features of a community. The one which characterize the people of

<text>Berzo Inferiore (Camunian: ) is an Italian comune of 2,316 inhabitants in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, in Lombardy, northern Italy.

==Geography==
The village of Berzo Inferiore (Inferiore means &quot;at the bottom&quot; to distinguish from Berzo Demo) is situated in Val Grigna, a side valley of the Oglio valley, upstream from Esine and downstream from Bienno.

==History==


The area has known habitation dating back to Mesolithic prehistory, as ascribed from artifacts found near Passo Crestoso. The first documentation of the town name is in a document from 1041, that mentions &quot;Bercio&quot;. Documents also cite a quarrel with the nearby town of Bovegno regarding pastoral lands. In 1350, the bishop of Brescia, Zanino Federici of Gorzone, asserted feudal rights for the territories of the Lower Berzo, Ono and Cricolo and Cerveno of Rainaldo.

In July 1404, the town of Berzo was destroyed by the Guelphs from the towns of Predore and Adrara San Rocco, which had suffered depredations and looting at the hands of townsmen of Berzo. In 1562, the priest Giacomo Pandolfi was sent by the Bishop of Brescia, Domenico Bollani, to Berzo; his mission was to urge the local authorities to censure and cease the frequent episodes of public dancing in the town.

A miraculous apparition of the Virgin Mary to Marta Polentini is said to have occurred in 1618.

In 1867, the provincial council of Brescia agreed to the union of municipalities and Bienno Berzo: this was not carried out due to popular opposition. Between 1927 and 1947, due to fascist laws on municipalities, the municipalities of Bienno Berzo were aggregated.

==Main sights==
The churches of Berzo Inferiore are:
* Shrine of Our Lady parish church, erected at the 1609th It has a tower of 55 meters and a portal &quot;stone of Sarnico&quot;. Inside, the altarpiece of Fiammenghino.
* Church of San Lorenzo, fifteenth century church with frescoes by Giovanni Pietro da Cemmo
* Church of San Glisente, is on top of the mountain the same name, retains a crypt of the sixteenth century.

==Culture==
The scütüm are in camunian dialect nicknames, sometimes personal, elsewhere showing the characteristic features of a community. The one which characterize the people of Berzo Inferiore is &quot;Gòs&quot; or &quot; Farisé&quot;.

<doc id="1039292" wikidata="Q253023" url="?curid=1039292" title="Trona">
<text>Trona (trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate, also sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate, Na2CO3·NaHCO3·2H2O) is a non-marine evaporite mineral. It is mined as the primary source of sodium carbonate in the United States, where it has replaced the Solvay process used in most of the rest of the world for sodium carbonate production. Turkey is also a major producer.

== Etymology ==
The word entered English by way of either Swedish () or Spanish (), with both possible sources having the same meaning as in English: the mineral natron from North Africa. Both the Spanish and Swedish terms derive from the Arabic &quot;trōn&quot;, which in turn derives from Arabic &quot;natron&quot; and Hebrew (&quot;natruna&quot;), which comes from ancient Greek (&quot;nitron&quot;), derived ultimately from ancient Egyptian &quot;ntry&quot; (or &quot;nitry&#x27;’).

== Natural deposits ==
 Trona is found at Owens Lake and Searles Lake, California; the Green River Formation of Wyoming and Utah; the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana and in the Nile Valley in Egypt. The trona near Green River, Wyoming, is the largest known deposit in the world and lies in layered evaporite deposits below ground, where the trona was deposited in a lake during the Paleogene Period. Trona has also been mined at Lake Magadi in the Kenyan Rift Valley for nearly 100 years. The northern part of Lake Natron is covered by a 1.5 m thick trona bed, and occurs in &#x27;salt&#x27; pans in the Etosha National Park in Namibia. The Beypazari region in the Ankara Province of Turkey has some 33 trona beds in two fault-bound lensoid bodies in and above oil shales of the Lower Hirka Formation (16 in the lower and 17 in the upper body). The Wucheng basin trona mine, Henan Province China has some 36 trona beds (693–974 m deep), the lower 15 beds are 0.5–1.5 m thick, thickest 2.38 m; the upper 21 beds are 1–3 m thick, with a maximum of 4.56 m hosted and underlain by dolomitic oil shales of the Wulidui Formation.

Trona has also been found in magmatic environments. Research has shown that trona can be formed by autometasomatic reactions of late-magmatic fluids or melts (or supercritical fluid-melt mixtures), with earlier crystallized rocks within the same plutonic complex, or by large-scale vapor unmixing in the very final stages of magmatism.

== Crystal structure ==

The crystal structure of trona was first determined by Brown et al. (1949). The structure consists of units of 3 edge-sharing sodium polyhedra (a central octahedron flanked by septahedra), cross-linked by carbonate groups and hydrogen bonds. Bacon and Curry (1956) refined the structure determination using two-dimensional single-crystal neutron diffraction, and suggested that the hydrogen atom in the symmetric (HC2O6)3− anion is disordered. The environment of the disordered H atom was later investigated by Choi and Mighell (1982) at 300 K with three-dimensional single-crystal neutron diffraction: they concluded that the H atom is dynamically disordered between two equivalent sites, separated from one another by 0.211(9) Å. The dynamically disordered H atom was reinvestigated at low temperature by O&#x27;Bannon et al. 2014 and they concluded that it does not order at temperatures as low as 100K.

== Uses ==
* Trona is a common source of soda ash, which is a significant economic commodity because of its applications in manufacturing glass, chemicals, paper, detergents, and textiles.
* It is used to condition water.
* It is used to remove sulfur from both flue gases and lignite coals.
* It is a product of carbon sequestration of flue gases.
* It is also used as a food additive.

<text>The four species of lion tamarins or maned marmosets make up the genus Leontopithecus. They are small New World monkeys named for the mane surrounding their face, similar to the mane of a lion.

==Description==

Living in the eastern rainforests of Brazil, like all other callitrichids they are arboreal. Lion tamarins weigh up to and are about long, with tails about long. They jump through trees using their fingers to hold on to branches; they use their claws to dig under the bark to search for insects to eat. They also eat some snakes, small lizards, and small fruits. All are endangered or critically endangered, in part because their habitat has been severely disrupted by human development and climate change.

Lion tamarins tend to live in family groups, with both parents sharing different tasks of rearing the yearly twins born to them. The mother nurses her young every two to three hours, and the father carries the babies on his back.

Diurnal tree-dwellers, they sleep in tree cavities at night. They also seek shelter during the hottest part of the day.

==Species list==
The different species of lion tamarins are easily discernible from each other, based upon the coloration of their fur:




== Conservation ==
Climate change has been affecting the lion tamarins in that cocoa production has taken over their habitat. Mass produced cocoa has been found to thin out surrounding canopy trees in the area. These trees are where lion tamarins mostly reside throughout the day.

<text>Nightshade is a 1989 science fiction novel by Jack Butler. The novel was Butler&#x27;s first published foray into science fiction.

== Plot ==

The story is set on Mars in the late 21st Century. It follows the exploits of the 400-year-old vampire John Shade, whose comfortable life in the Hellas crater on Mars is disrupted when he is forced to become part of a complex conspiracy to protect the Janglers, a sub-species of humans who have replaced parts of their brains with technology.

Shade eventually becomes the leader of a collection of loners, losers, drop-outs and rebels, holding them together through unwitting charisma and a sense of personal vengeance against the government of Mars.

As a vampire, Shade sometimes feels a lust for blood, though this only occurs once or twice a year - though the Need, as it is called, strikes several times during the course of the novel for reasons that are not fully explained. Shade also possesses increased strength and reflexes, a photographic memory, excellent mathematical knowledge, the ability to change his own shape and the power to &quot;shift&quot; into &quot;high temporal&quot;, which tremendously enhances his speed. Shade has read Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula and believes it to be &quot;foolish in many details&quot;.

== Shade&#x27;s companions ==

Jennie Brady: A female Jangler who changes her surname to Jennie Dark in a play on &quot;Jeanne D&#x27;Arc&quot;, or Joan of Arc, indicating her willingness to die for her cause. Jennie is ten years old by Martian standards, which in Earth terms puts her at nineteen or twenty years old. Shade falls in love with Jennie the moment he meets her. Aside from crude cosmetic surgery to reconstruct her face and part of her skull, she exactly resembles the woman Shade married nearly four hundred years ago while he was still human.

Mandrake: A Starbuck-class artificial intelligence with a dry sense of humour and a passionate love for existentialism. Mandrake is the secret seventh Starbuck AI to be built by Earth engineers for the colonisation of Mars; officially there were only six Starbucks who each went insane after Mars was created. This insanity is likely to be due to the Starbucks&#x27; deep, complicated personalities. If Mandrake is any example, they found their own existence hard to justify; they cannot grow old and die like humans, nor can they enter Heaven - should such a place exist. Mandrake has so far avoided the fate of insanity due to his close personal friendship with military strategist RJ Benjamin and, later, John Shade. Shade&#x27;s relationship with Mandrake tends to be one of mutual antagonism with moments of deep trust.

Minor characters include Shade&#x27;s colleague and romantic interest Pappy, the government strategist RJ Benjamin and a rich &quot;nettie&quot; called Sinclair.

The novel also features a character called &quot;the No Poet&quot;, an unknown author of existentialist poetry. He (or she) claims to be nonexistent, an experimental computer program created as part of ongoing research into sentient artificial intelligence. Despite - or perhaps because of - this, the No Poet&#x27;s work is highly regarded by humans, and his lonely, forsaken sense of self is shared by many in a dissatisfied future.

<doc id="1039304" wikidata="Q16930509" url="?curid=1039304" title="Rock sliders">
<text>Rock sliders are an aftermarket accessory popular among four wheel drive vehicle owners who engage in more serious off-road driving.

Rock sliders are typically made of heavy-duty box section steel, although they can also be made from tubular steel as well. They run along each side of the vehicle, from just behind the front wheel to just before the rear wheel, just below the level of the door sills. They are welded or bolted (directly, L brackets and/or U brackets) on to the vehicle&#x27;s frame, and their function is to protect the door sills and door bottoms from damage when crossing large obstacles (such as rocks - hence the name). There are a variety of materials, qualities and features.

==Types==
Even though they serve relatively the same purpose, rock sliders come in four different types:
*Classic rock sliders – intended to protect the vehicle&#x27;s side but can help to get in and out of the vehicle.
*Side steps with rock slider support – the general purpose is to help people get in and out of the vehicle, but additionally, the steps protect the vehicle from off-roading hazards, such as rocks.
*Power running boards – an electrically powered board that gets in out and hides away whenever the doors are opened/closed. Primarily serves as a modern and lightweight side step but additionally protects the vehicle from underneath.
*Rock sliders with rock skins – a combination of classy side steps and rocks skins. Rocks skins are stripes of steel usually drilled into the vehicle&#x27;s body to protect it from dents, scratches, and other off-roading damage.

<doc id="1039305" wikidata="Q134884" url="?curid=1039305" title="Basilosaurus">
<text>Basilosaurus (meaning &quot;king lizard&quot;) is a genus of large, predatory, prehistoric archaeocete whale from the late Eocene, approximately 41.3 to 33.9 million years ago (mya). First described in 1834, it was the first archaeocete and prehistoric whale known to science. Fossils attributed to the type species &quot;B. cetoides&quot; were discovered in the southeastern United States. They were originally thought to be of a giant reptile, hence the suffix &quot;-saurus&quot;, Ancient Greek for &quot;lizard&quot;. The animal was later found to be an early marine mammal, prompting attempts at renaming the creature, which failed as the rules of zoological nomenclature dictate using the original name given. The second species named in 1904, &quot;B. isis&quot;, lived in the region currently known as the Mediterranean Sea, with fossils found in North Africa and Jordan.

&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; is thought to have been one of the largest animals of the Paleogene, with the type species &quot;B. cetoides&quot; measuring around long and weighing up to . It was the top predator of its environment in the shallows of the inland sea, preying on sharks, large fish and other marine mammals. The smaller dolphin-like relative &quot;Dorudon&quot; seems to have been the predominant food source of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; based on its stomach contents and the bite marks preserved in the skull of &quot;Dorudon&quot;.

&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; was at one point a wastebasket taxon before the genus slowly started getting reevaluated, with many species of different Eocene cetacean being assigned to the genus in the past. However, most are invalid or have been reclassified under a new or different genus, leaving only two confirmed species.
&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; may have been one of the first fully aquatic cetaceans, sometimes referred to as the Pelagiceti. &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, unlike modern cetaceans, had various types of teeth–such as canines and molars–in its mouth (heterodonty), and it probably was able to chew its food, in contrast to modern cetaceans which swallow their food whole.

== Taxonomic history ==
=== Etymology ===

The two species of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; are &quot;B. cetoides&quot;, whose remains were discovered in the United States, and &quot;B. isis&quot;, which was discovered in Egypt. &quot;B. cetoides&quot; is the type species for the genus. The holotype of &quot;B. cetoides&quot; was found in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana. Vertebrae were sent to the American Philosophical Society by a Judge Henry Bry of Ouachita Parish, Louisiana and Judge John Creagh of Clarke County, Alabama. Both fossils ended up in the hands of the anatomist Richard Harlan, who requested more examples from Creagh. The first bones were unearthed when rain caused a hillside full of sea shells to slide. The bones were lying in a curved line &quot;measuring upwards of four hundred feet [122 meters] in length, with intervals which were vacant.&quot; Many of these bones were used as andirons and destroyed; Bry saved the bones he could find, but was convinced more bones were still to be found on the location. Bry speculated that the bones must have belonged to a &quot;sea monster&quot; and supplied &quot;a piece having the appearance of a tooth&quot; to help determine which kind.

Harlan identified the tooth as a wedge-shaped shell and instead focused on &quot;a vertebra of enormous dimensions&quot; which he assumed belonged to the order &quot;Enalio-Sauri of Conybeare&quot;, &quot;found only in the sub-cretaceous series.&quot; He noted that some parts of the vertebra were similar to those of &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; and skull was similar to &quot;Mosasaurus&quot;, but that they were completely different in proportions. Comparing his vertebra to those of large dinosaurs such as &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, Harlan concluded that his specimen was considerably larger—he estimated the animal to have been no less than long—and therefore suggested the name &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, meaning &quot;king lizard&quot;.

Harlan brought his assembled specimens (including fragments of jaw and teeth, humerus, and rib fragments) to the UK where he presented them to anatomist Richard Owen. Owen concluded that the molar teeth were two-rooted, a dental morphology unknown in fishes and reptiles, and more complex and varied than in any known reptile, and therefore that the specimen must be a mammal. Owen correctly associated the teeth with cetaceans, but he thought it was an herbivorous animal, similar to sirenians. Consequently, Owen proposed renaming the find &quot;Zeuglodon cetoides&quot; (&quot;whale-like yoke teeth&quot; in reference to the double-rooted teeth) and Harlan agreed.

===Wadi El Hitan===

Wādī al-Ḥītān () is an Egyptian sandstone formation where many early-whale skeletons were discovered. German botanist Georg August Schweinfurth discovered the first archaeocete whale in Egypt (&quot;Zeuglodon osiris&quot;, now &quot;Saghacetus osiris&quot;) in 1879. He visited the Qasr el Sagha Formation in 1884 and 1886 and missed the now famous Wadi El Hitan by a few kilometers. German paleontologist Wilhelm Barnim Dames described the material, including the type specimen of &quot;Z. osiris&quot;, a well-preserved dentary.

Hugh Beadnell, head of the Geological Survey of Egypt 1896–1906, named and described &quot;Zeuglodon isis&quot; in based on a partial mandible and several vertebrae from Wadi El Hitan in Egypt. described a skull and some vertebrae of a smaller archaeocete and named it &quot;Prozeuglodon atrox&quot;, now known today as &quot;Dorudon atrox&quot;. discovered deciduous teeth in this skull and it was then believed to be a juvenile [&quot;Pro&quot;]&quot;zeuglodon isis&quot; for decades before more complete fossils of mature &quot;Dorudon&quot; were discovered.

In the 1980s, Elwyn L. Simons and Philip D. Gingerich started to excavate at Qasr el-Sagha and Wadi El Hitan with the hope of finding material that could match archaeocete fossils from Pakistan. Since then, over 500 archaeocete skeletons have been found at these two locations, of which most are &quot;B. isis&quot; or &quot;D. atrox&quot;, several of the latter carrying bite marks assumed to be from the former. A 1990 paper described additional fossils including foot bones and speculated that the reduced hind limbs were used as copulatory guides. One thing that was noted, was that whale fossils were so common, that when a mason company looked at their newest table counter, they realized that they had created a cross section of a 40 million year old basilosaurid fossil. This find was another thing that caught the eye of Gingerich.

In 2015, a complete skeleton, the first-ever such find for &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, was uncovered in Wadi El Hitan, preserved with the remains of its prey, including a &quot;Dorudon&quot; and several species of fish. The whale&#x27;s skeleton also shows signs of scavenging by large sharks such as the otodontid &quot;Otodus sokolovi&quot;, though the study considered it possible that this shark was also part of the diet of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;.

===Wastebasket taxa===
Many dubious species have been assigned to &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; in the past which have since been invalidated or were too incomplete to determine anything.

====&quot;Nomina dubia&quot;====
A &quot;nomen dubium&quot; is a scientific name that is of unknown or doubtful application. There are a few documented cases of this being applied to &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; in the past.

* &quot;Zeuglodon wanklyni&quot;, was a supposed species of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, that described in 1876 based on a skull found in the Wanklyn&#x27;s Barton Cliff in the United Kingdom. This single specimen, however, quickly disappeared and has since been declared a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; or referred to as &quot;Zygorhiza wanklyni&quot;.
* &quot;Zeuglodon vredense&quot; or &quot;vredensis&quot; was named in the 19th century based on a single, isolated tooth without any kind of accompanying description, and therefore declared it a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;.
* &quot;Zeuglodon puschi[i]&quot; was a species that was said to come from Poland, it was named by . noted that the species is based on an incomplete vertebra of indeterminable position and, therefore, that the species is invalid.
* &quot;Zeuglodon brachyspondylus&quot; was described by Johannes Peter Müller based on some vertebrae from &quot;Zeuglodon hydrarchus&quot;, better known as Dr. Albert Koch&#x27;s &quot;Hydrarchos&quot;. , synonymized it with &quot;Pontogeneus priscus&quot;, which a 2005 study declared a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

====Reassigned species====

* &quot;Basilosaurus drazindai&quot; was named by a 1997 study based on a single lumbar vertebra. Originally, the species was thought to have lived in Pakistan and the UK. It was later declared a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; by Uhen (2013), but Gingerich and Zouhri (2015) reassigned it to the genus &quot;Eocetus&quot;. This species was at one point in time concluded to be the earliest record of the genus &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, before its reclassification.
* &quot;Zeuglodon elliotsmithii&quot;, &quot;Z. sensitivius&quot;, and &quot;Z. zitteli&quot; were synonymized and grouped under the genus &quot;Saghacetus&quot; by a 1992 study.
* &quot;Zeuglodon paulsoni&quot; from Ukraine (then the Russian Empire) was named by . It was synonymized with &quot;Platyosphys&quot; but is now considered &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. Gingerich and Zouhri (2015), however, maintain &quot;Platyosphys&quot; as valid.
* &quot;Basilosaurus caucasicus&quot; also known as &quot;Basilosaurus caucasicum&quot; or &quot;Zeuglodon caucasicum&quot; was a species described in the Russian Empire, it gets its name from the Caucasus of where it was found in the 1890s. The fossil was reassigned to the toothed whale &quot;Microzeuglodon caucasicum&quot;.
* &quot;Basilosaurus harwoodi &quot;was discovered in the Murray River near Wellington in South Australia. This species classification was controversial; T. S. Hall (1911) placed &quot;Basilosaurus harwoodi&quot; (or &quot;Zeuglodon harwoodi&quot;) in the genus &quot;Metasqualodon&quot;.
*In 1906, German naturalist Othenio Abel thought fossils from the Eocene of Alabama, previously described in 1900 as being a &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; hip bone by American zoologist Frederic Augustus Lucas, represented the shoulder of a large bird similar to &quot;Gastornis&quot;, and named it &quot;Alabamornis gigantea&quot;. Lucas later countered his conclusion in 1908 as he reassigned the fossil specimens to the original conclusion of a &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; hip bone.

== Description ==
&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; is one of the largest animals known to exist between the K–Pg extinction event 66 million years ago (mya) and around 15 million years ago when modern cetaceans began to reach enormous sizes. &quot;B. cetoides&quot; measured long and &quot;B. isis&quot; measured long. A 1998 study estimated that &quot;B. cetoides&quot; weighed more than and &quot;B. isis&quot; weighed nearly , while the 2025 study estimated that a long &quot;B. cetoides&quot; weighed . &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; is distinguished from other genera of basilosaurids by its larger body size and its more elongated posterior thoracic, lumbar, and anterior caudal vertebrae. &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; does not have the vertically oriented metapophyses seen in its closest relative the basilosaurid known as &quot;Basiloterus&quot;. &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; is considered to be the largest of archeocete whales.

=== Cranium ===

The dental formula for &quot;B. isis&quot; is . The upper and lower molars and second to fourth premolars are double-rooted and high-crowned.

The head of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; did not have room for a melon like modern toothed whales, and the brain was smaller in comparison, as well. They are not believed to have had the echolocation capabilities nor the social dynamics of extant cetaceans. 

A 2011 study concluded that the skull of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; is asymmetrical like in modern toothed whales, and not, as previously assumed, symmetrical like in baleen whales and artiodactyls (which are closely related to cetaceans). In modern toothed whales, this asymmetry is associated with high-frequency sound production and echolocation, neither of which is thought to have been present in &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;. This probably evolved to detect sound underwater, with a fatty sound-receiving pad in the mandible.

In the skull, the inner and middle ear are enclosed by a dense tympanic bulla. The synapomorphic cetacean air sinus system is partially present in basilosaurids, including the pterygoid, peribullary, maxillary, and frontal sinuses. The periotic bone, which surrounds the inner ear, is partially isolated. The mandibular canal is large and laterally flanked by a thin bony wall, the pan bone or acoustic fenestra. These features enabled basilosaurs to hear directionally in water.

The ear of basilosaurids is more derived than those in earlier archaeocetes, such as remingtonocetids and protocetids, in the acoustic isolation provided by the air-filled sinuses inserted between the ear and the skull. The basilosaurid ear did, however, have a large external auditory meatus, strongly reduced in modern cetaceans, but, though this was probably functional, it can have been of little use under water.

=== Hind limbs ===

A individual of &quot;B. isis&quot; had hind limbs with fused tarsals and only three digits. The limited size of the limb and the absence of an articulation with the sacral vertebrae make a locomotory function unlikely. Analysis has shown that the reduced limbs could rapidly adduct between only two positions. Possible uses for the structure have been given, such as clasper-like body functions (compare to the function of pelvic spurs, the last vestiges of limbs in certain modern snakes). These limbs would have been used to guide the animals&#x27; long bodies during mating.

=== Spine and movement ===
A complete &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; skeleton was found in 2015, and several attempts have been made to reconstruct the vertebral column from partial skeletons. estimated a total of 58 vertebrae, based on two partial and nonoverlapping skeletons of &quot;B. cetoides&quot; from Alabama. More complete fossils uncovered in Egypt in the 1990s allowed a more accurate estimation: the vertebral column of &quot;B. isis&quot; has been reconstructed from three overlapping skeletons to a total of 70 vertebrae with a vertebral formula interpreted as seven cervical, 18 thoracic, 20 lumbar and sacral, and 25 caudal vertebrae. The vertebral formula of &quot;B. cetoides&quot; can be assumed to be the same.

&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; has an anguilliform (eel-like) body shape because of the elongation of the centra of the thoracic through anterior caudal vertebrae. In life, these vertebrae were filled with marrow, and because of the enlarged size, this made them buoyant. &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; probably swam predominantly in two dimensions at the sea surface, in contrast to the smaller &quot;Dorudon&quot;, which was likely a diving, three-dimensional swimmer. The skeletal anatomy of the tail suggests that a small fluke was probably present, which would have aided only vertical motion.

Similarly sized thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebrae imply that it moved in an anguilliform fashion, but predominantly in the vertical plane. Paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich theorized that &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; may also have moved in a very odd, horizontal anguilliform fashion to some degree, something completely unknown in modern cetaceans. The vertebrae appear to have been hollow, and likely also fluid-filled. This would imply that &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; typically functioned in only two dimensions at the ocean surface, compared with the three-dimensional habits of most other cetaceans. Judging from the relatively weak axial musculature and the thick bones in the limbs, &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; is not believed to have been capable of sustained swimming or deep diving, or terrestrial locomotion.

== Paleobiology ==
=== Feeding ===

The cheek teeth of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; retain a complex morphology and functional occlusion. Heavy wear on the teeth reveals that food was first chewed then swallowed. Scientists were able to estimate the bite force of &quot;Basilosaurus isis&quot; by analyzing the scarred skull bones of another species of prehistoric whale, &quot;Dorudon&quot;, and concluded that it could exert a maximum bite force of at least and could possibly exceed , roughly equivalent to the range between modern alligators and crocodiles.

Analyses of the stomach contents of &quot;B. cetoides&quot; has shown that this species fed exclusively on fish and large sharks, while bite marks on the skulls of juvenile &quot;Dorudon&quot; have been matched with the dentition of &quot;B. isis&quot;, suggesting a dietary difference between the two species, similar to that found in different populations of modern killer whales. It was probably an active predator rather than a scavenger. The discovery of juvenile &quot;Dorudon&quot; at Wadi Al Hitan bearing distinctive bite marks on their skulls indicates that &quot;B. isis&quot; would have aimed for the skulls of its victims to kill its prey, and then subsequently torn its meals apart, based on the disarticulated remains of the &quot;Dorudon&quot; skeletons. The finding further cements theories that &quot;B. isis&quot; was an apex predator that may have hunted newborn and juvenile &quot;Dorudon&quot; at Wadi Al Hitan when mothers of the latter came to give birth. The stomach contents of an elderly male &quot; B. isis&quot; not only includes &quot;Dorudon&quot; but the fish &quot;Pycnodus mokattamensis&quot;.

===Paleoecology===

&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; would have been the top predator of its environment. It lived in the warm tropical environment of the Eocene in areas abundant with sea grasses, such as &quot;Thalassodendron&quot;, &quot;Thalassia&quot; (also known as turtle grass) and &quot;Halodule&quot;. Based on the localities where its fossils are discovered, &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; would have preferred to live in the shallows, specifically in the middle to outer neritic zones of the inland sea. It would have coexisted with the dolphin-like &quot;Dorudon&quot;, the whales &quot;Cynthiacetus&quot; and &quot;Basiloterus&quot;, the primitive sirenian &quot;Protosiren&quot;, the early elephant &quot;Moeritherium&quot;, the sea turtle &quot;Puppigerus&quot; and many sharks, such as &quot;Galeocerdo alabamensis&quot;, &quot;Physogaleus&quot;, &quot;Otodus&quot;, &quot;Squatina prima&quot;, &quot;Striatolamia&quot;, &quot;Carcharocles sokolovi&quot; and &quot;Isurus praecursor&quot;.

==Extinction==

&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; fossil record seems to end at about 35–33.9 mya. &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; extinction coincides with the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event which happened 33.9 mya, which also resulted in the extinction of almost all other archaeocetes. The event has been attributed to volcanic activity, meteor impacts, or a sudden change in climate (such as the environment getting cooler), the latter of which might have caused changes in the ocean by disrupting oceanic circulation, thus limiting the numbers of prey for predators like &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; to feed on. &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; went extinct leaving no descendants, along with the rest of the Archaeocetes. After their extinction, the new currents and deep ocean upwelling created a new environment that favored the evolutionary diversification of modern cetaceans (Neocetes) such as early toothed and baleen whales, from more advanced Archaeocetes that evolved the traits associated with Neocetes.

==Classification==
Below is the phylogenetic analysis on the placement of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;. Two subfamilies exist in Basilosauridae: Basilosaurinae which includes &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, and Dorudontinae. These groups have been declared invalid in the past. &quot;Dorudon&quot; remains were once thought to represent juvenile &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;.
==In popular culture==
The species &quot;B. cetoides&quot; is the state fossil of Alabama and Mississippi. During the early 19th century, &quot;B. cetoides&quot; fossils were so common (and sufficiently large) that they were regularly used as furniture in the American South.

&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; is featured in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Walking with...&quot; series in &quot;Walking with Beasts&quot; and &quot;Sea Monsters&quot;.

In the novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; by Herman Melville, Ishmael cites the &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; during his studies as a possible whale fossil.

<text>Bienno (Camunian: ) is an Italian &quot;comune&quot; in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, Lombardy. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

==Geography==
The village is located in Val Grigna, on the northern side of the river Grigna. It is bordered by other towns such as: Bagolino, Berzo Inferiore, Bovegno, Breno, Cividate Camuno, Collio, Prestine.

== History ==

In 1295 a dispute occurred with the neighbouring village Bovegno regarding some high pastures.

On 25 January 1350 the bishop of Brescia invested iure feuds for a tenth of the rights in the territories of the Municipality of Bienno (vicinia) and men of Bienno. This also happened back in 1295, 1336, and later in 1388, 1423 and 1486.

In 1391 the land of Bienno, which sided with the Ghibellines, was the site of extensive cattle raiding by the Guelph Camuni, led by Baroncino Nobili of Lozio.

The peace of Breno was signed on 31 December 1397 by the representative of the community of Bienno, Lanini Bertolino di Martino, who was a Ghibelline.

Between 1805 and 1815 the town of Bienno was united to Prestine and called &quot;Bienno with Prestine.&quot;

== Main sights ==
Bienno is part of the club of &quot;The Most Beautiful Villages in Italy&quot; creation of the Council of Tourism of the Association of Italian Municipalities (ANCI).


=== Religious architecture ===
* The parish church, dedicated to Saints Faustino and Giovita, was rebuilt in the early years of 17th Century strictly in accordance with Counter-Reformation rules; a single nave with six side altars; impressive painting cycle mostly made by Giovanni Mauro della Rovere (also known as &quot;Il Fiamminghino&quot;); a beautiful wrought iron gate dating back to 1647; a 17th-century organ made by members of the Antegnati family and remodeled by Serassi.
* The smallest church in the lower part of the old town, the &quot;Chiesa di Santa Maria Annunziata&quot; (once called &quot;Santa Maria degli Orti&quot;). In its single nave, it contains frescoes of great value produced during the 16th century by various artists, including Giovanni Pietro da Cemmo and Romanino. The frescoes also include, among various subjects, a danse macabre to the right of the altar.
* Hermitage of St. Peter and Paul, built in the second half of the 20th century, but originated in the 11th or 12th century, when Cluny monks came to Valcamonica.

* Church of San Defendente on a hill at the north entrance of Bienno dating back to the 15th century.
* Church of &quot;St Peter ad Vincula&quot; (or &quot;San Peder Suc&quot;) of 16th century. It is built onto a Roman altar of Bacchus (hence the name &quot;St. Peter Succo&quot;) of which you can see the remains in the back of the building.
* Hill of Christ the King: there stands a monument to Christ the King, a golden statue erected in 1931.
* Chapel of the pools (&quot;Cappella delle piscine&quot;), dating back to the 15th century and reworked in the 17th century.
=== And also===
* The House of Panteghini, built in 1483.
* The House of Bettoni dated of 1550.
* The Simoni-Fè Palace, was given in 1932 to the municipality by the Countess Paolina Fè of Ostiani Montholon 
when she left, after a fatal hunting accident caused by her husband, Count &quot; Jean Charles Tristan de Montholon &quot;, son of Charles Tristan, marquis de Montholon, suspected to have poisoned the Emperor Napoleon, in Saint Helena, and brother of &quot; Hélène Napoleone Bonaparte de Montholon &quot;, whose father could be Napoleon and who lived 90 years,

with the exception of the usufruct of the lower floors, left to &quot;Liberata Fostinelli&quot; and &quot;Battista Panteghini&quot; and all their descendants &quot; ad vitam eternam&quot;, to reward them from their loyalty.

This usufruct has been transferred to the municipality of Bienno by their children &quot;Battista Panteghini&quot;, son of Liberata, and &quot;Maria Bettoni&quot;, whose family was the owner of the Palazzo Bettoni in Bienno, in 1988, because of the difficulties of maintenance and heating the palace, and their old age. It becomes the Public Library and a cultural center.

==Traditions and folklore==
The scütüm are in camunian dialect nicknames, sometimes personal, elsewhere showing the characteristic features of a community. The one which characterize the people of Bienno is &quot;Padèle&quot;.

On 28 June, the eve of feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the villagers put an egg white in a bottle which they leave in the open air until the next morning; albumin coagulated in filaments then evokes the masts and sails of a boat, it is the boat of Saint Peter.

== Events ==
All buildings, museums and churches are open to the public every year, for a week, until midnight in August, during the village festival called &quot;Mostra Mercato&quot; former flour mill and forge are returned to service.
This week welcomes thousands of visitors.

== Film ==
Mostra mercato 2014

<text>William Wilkins (31 August 1778 – 31 August 1839) was an English architect, classical scholar and archaeologist. He designed the National Gallery and University College London, and buildings for several Cambridge colleges.

==Life==
Wilkins was born in the parish of St Giles, Norwich, the son of William Wilkins (1751–1815), a successful builder who also managed the Norwich Theatre Circuit, a chain of theatres. His younger brother George Wilkins became Archdeacon of Nottingham.

He was educated at Norwich School and then won a scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He graduated as 6th wrangler in 1800. With the award of the Worts Travelling Bachelorship in 1801, worth £100 for three years, he was able to visit the classical antiquities Greece, Asia Minor, and Magna Græcia in Italy between 1801 and 1804. On his tour he was accompanied by the Italian landscape painter Agostino Aglio, whom Wilkins had commissioned as a draughtsman on the expedition. Aglio supplied the drawings for the aquatint plates of monuments illustrating Wilkins&#x27; volumes from the expedition, such as &quot;The Antiquities of Magna Graecia&quot; (1807).

Wilkins was a member of the Society of Dilettanti from 1817. He published researches into both Classical and Gothic architecture, becoming one of the leading figures in the English Greek Revival of the early 19th century.
His architectural career began in 1804 with his Greek-revival designs for the newly established Downing College, Cambridge. The commission came after earlier plans in a Palladian style by James Wyatt had been rejected as insufficiently classical. Wilkins arranged the college buildings around a single large courtyard. Construction began in 1807 and proceeded slowly, coming to a halt in 1821 with Wilkins&#x27; scheme still incomplete.

In 1806, Wilkins designed a college near Hertford for the East India Company. It became Haileybury College following the dissolution of the company. He built or added to Osberton House, near Worksop. These works were followed in 1808 by the Doric entrance to the Lower Assembly Rooms at Bath, and a villa at North Berwick for Sir H. D. Hamilton. At Grange Park, Northington, Hampshire, in 1809, Wilkins encased and remodelled an existing seventeenth-century house, giving it something of the form of a Greek temple, with a large Doric portico at one end.

In 1815, Wilkins inherited his father&#x27;s chain of six theatres. He continued to manage them for the rest of his life, and rebuilt or remodelled several of them, occasionally also designing scenery.

In 1822–26, he collaborated with John Peter Gandy on the Clubhouse for the new United University Club, in Pall Mall, London. He was made an associate of the Royal Society in 1824 and given full membership in 1826.

Wilkins was influential in the development of London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square, which had been opened up as part of a scheme by John Nash. He campaigned to have the new building for the National Gallery sited on the north side of the square, initially suggesting that the existing building, William Kent&#x27;s Great Mews should be converted for the purpose. The government accepted the idea, but opted for a wholly new building, and a Neoclassical design by Wilkins was accepted over alternative schemes by Nash and CR Cockerell. Wilkins also drew up plans for the laying out of the square itself. They were not put into effect, although the scheme eventually carried out by Charles Barry after Wilkins&#x27; death replicated many of his ideas. The appearance of the National Gallery (1832–38), which was originally shared with the Royal Academy, attracted adverse criticism from the beginning. John Summerson concluded in 1962 that although Wilkins&#x27; frontage has many virtues &quot;considered critically as a façade commanding a great square, its weakness is apparent&quot;.

Wilkins carried out two other major London buildings in a severe Classical style both designed in 1827–28: University College on Gower Street, and St George&#x27;s Hospital (now The Lanesborough hotel on Hyde Park Corner). His other Greek Revival works include the Theatre Royal Bury St Edmunds 1819, St. Paul&#x27;s Church, George Street, Nottingham 1822 and the Yorkshire Museum (1830). He was responsible for two columns commemorating Admiral Nelson, one in Dublin and the Britannia Monument in Great Yarmouth. Both predate William Railton&#x27;s design for Trafalgar Square.

He also produced buildings in the Gothic style, such as Dalmeny House for Lord Rosebery in 1814–17 and Tregothnan for Lord Falmouth in 1816. He used the style at several Cambridge colleges: in 1823 he won the competition to design a set of new buildings for King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, comprising the hall, provost&#x27;s lodge, library, and a stone screen towards Trumpington Street, and in the same year started work on the King&#x27;s court of Trinity College, and new buildings, including the chapel, at Corpus Christi College. 

In 1827, Wilkins was appointed architect to the East India Company, and the next year made alterations to its building in Leadenhall Street. He entered the competition to design the Duke of York&#x27;s Column, and in 1836 that for the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament. After failing to win the latter he attacked the plans of his rivals and the decision of the committee in a pamphlet signed &quot;Phil-archimedes&quot;.

He was appointed professor of architecture at the Royal Academy following the death of John Soane in 1837, but gave no lectures before he himself died at his house in Cambridge on 31 August 1839. He was buried in the crypt under the chapel of Corpus Christi College.

<doc id="1039311" wikidata="Q1304649" url="?curid=1039311" title="A Hero of Our Time">
<text>A Hero of Our Time () is a novel by Mikhail Lermontov, written in 1839, published in 1840, and revised in 1841.

It is an example of the superfluous man novel, noted for its compelling Byronic hero (or antihero) Pechorin and for the beautiful descriptions of the Caucasus. This is the first psychological fiction in the history of Russian literature. There are several English translations, including one by Vladimir Nabokov and Dmitri Nabokov in 1958.

==Grigory Alexandrovich Pechorin==
Pechorin is the embodiment of the Byronic hero. Byron&#x27;s works were of international repute and Lermontov mentions his name several times throughout the novel. According to the Byronic tradition, Pechorin is a character of contradiction. He is both sensitive and cynical. He is possessed of extreme arrogance, yet has a deep insight into his own character and epitomizes the melancholy of the Romantic hero who broods on the futility of existence and the certainty of death. Pechorin&#x27;s whole philosophy concerning existence is oriented towards the nihilistic, creating in him somewhat of a distanced, alienated personality. The name Pechorin is drawn from that of the Pechora River, in the far north, as a homage to Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s Eugene Onegin, named after the Onega River.

Pechorin treats women as an incentive for endless conquests and does not consider them worthy of any particular respect. He considers women such as Princess Mary to be little more than pawns in his games of romantic conquest, which in effect hold no meaning in his listless pursuit of pleasure. This is shown in his comment on Princess Mary: &quot;I often wonder why I&#x27;m trying so hard to win the love of a girl I have no desire to seduce and whom I&#x27;d never marry.&quot;

The only contradiction in Pechorin&#x27;s attitude to women are his genuine feelings for Vera, who loves him despite, and perhaps due to, all his faults. At the end of &quot;Princess Mary&quot; one is presented with a moment of hope as Pechorin gallops after Vera. The reader almost assumes that a meaning to his existence may be attained and that Pechorin can finally realize that true feelings are possible. Yet a lifetime of superficiality and cynicism cannot be so easily eradicated and when fate intervenes and Pechorin&#x27;s horse collapses, he undertakes no further effort to reach his one hope of redemption: &quot;I saw how futile and senseless it was to pursue lost happiness. What more did I want? To see her again? For what?”

Pechorin&#x27;s chronologically last adventure was first described in the book, showing the events that explain his upcoming fall into depression and retreat from society, resulting in his self-predicted death. The narrator is Maxim Maximytch telling the story of a beautiful Circassian princess, &quot;Bela&quot;, whom Azamat abducts for Pechorin in exchange for Kazbich&#x27;s horse. Maxim describes Pechorin&#x27;s exemplary persistence to convince Bela to give herself sexually to him, in which she with time reciprocates. After living with Bela for some time, Pechorin starts explicating his need for freedom, which Bela starts noticing, fearing he might leave her. Though Bela is completely devoted to Pechorin, she says she&#x27;s not his slave, rather a daughter of a Circassian tribal chieftain, also showing the intention of leaving if he &quot;doesn&#x27;t love her&quot;. Maxim&#x27;s sympathy for Bela makes him question Pechorin&#x27;s intentions. Pechorin admits he loves her and is ready to die for her, but &quot;he has a restless fancy and insatiable heart, and that his life is emptier day by day&quot;. He thinks his only remedy is to travel, to keep his spirit alive.
However, Pechorin&#x27;s behavior soon changes after Bela gets kidnapped by his enemy Kazbich, and becomes mortally wounded. After two days of suffering in delirium Bela spoke of her inner fears and her feelings for Pechorin, who listened without once leaving her side. After her death, Pechorin becomes physically ill, loses weight and becomes unsociable. After meeting with Maxim again, he acts coldly and antisocial, explicating deep depression and disinterest in interaction. He soon dies on his way back from Persia, admitting before that he is sure to never return.

Pechorin described his own personality as self-destructive, admitting he himself doesn&#x27;t understand his purpose in the world of men. His boredom with life, feeling of emptiness, forces him to indulge in all possible pleasures and experiences, which soon, cause the downfall of those closest to him. He starts to realize this with Vera and Grushnitsky, while the tragedy with Bela soon leads to his complete emotional collapse.

His crushed spirit after this and after the duel with Grushnitsky can be interpreted that he is not the detached character that he makes himself out to be. Rather, it shows that he suffers from his actions. Yet many of his actions are described both by himself and appear to the reader to be arbitrary. Yet this is strange as Pechorin&#x27;s intelligence is very high (typical of a Byronic hero). Pechorin&#x27;s explanation as to why his actions are arbitrary can be found in the last chapter where he speculates about fate. He sees his arbitrary behaviour not as being a subconscious reflex to past moments in his life but rather as fate. Pechorin grows dissatisfied with his life as each of his arbitrary actions lead him through more emotional suffering which he represses from the view of others.

==Cultural references==
Albert Camus&#x27; novel &quot;The Fall&quot; begins with an excerpt from Lermontov&#x27;s foreword to &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;: &quot;Some were dreadfully insulted, and quite seriously, to have held up as a model such an immoral character as &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;; others shrewdly noticed that the author had portrayed himself and his acquaintances. &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;, gentlemen, is in fact a portrait, but not of an individual; it is the aggregate of the vices of our whole generation in their fullest expression.&quot;

In Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; the plot revolves upon Soviet agent Tatiana Romanova feigning an infatuation with MI6&#x27;s James Bond and offering to defect to the West provided he&#x27;ll be sent to pick her up in Istanbul, Turkey. The Soviets elaborate a complex backstory about how she spotted the file about the English spy during her clerical work at SMERSH headquarters and became smitten with him, making her state that his picture made her think of Lermontov&#x27;s Pechorin. The fact that Pechorin was anything but a &#x27;hero&#x27; or even a positive character at all in Lermontov&#x27;s narration stands to indicate Fleming&#x27;s wry self-deprecating wit about his most famous creation; the irony is lost, however, on western readers not familiar with Lermontov&#x27;s work.

In Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Silence&quot;, the young son is seen reading the book in bed. In the opening sequence of Bergman&#x27;s next film, &quot;Persona&quot; (1966), the same child actor is seen waking in what appears to be a mortuary and reaching for the same book.

Claude Sautet&#x27;s film &quot;A Heart in Winter&quot; (&quot;Un cœur en hiver&quot;) was said to be based on &quot;his memories of&quot; the Princess Mary section. The relationship with Lermontov&#x27;s work is quite loose – the film takes place in contemporary Paris, where a young violin repairer (played by Daniel Auteuil) seeks to seduce his business partner&#x27;s girlfriend, a gifted violinist named Camille, into falling for his carefully contrived charms. He does this purely for the satisfaction of gaining control of her emotionally, while never loving her sincerely. He is a modern-day Pechorin.

==Quotations==

*&quot;My whole life has been merely a succession of miserable and unsuccessful denials of feelings or reason.&quot;
*&quot;...I am not capable of close friendship: of two close friends, one is always the slave of the other, although frequently neither of them will admit it. I cannot be a slave, and to command in such circumstances is a tiresome business, because one must deceive at the same time.&quot;
*&quot;Afraid of being judged, I buried my finer feelings in the depths of my heart and they died there.&quot;
*&quot;It is difficult to convince women of something; one must lead them to believe that they have convinced themselves.&quot;
*&quot;What of it? If I die, I die. It will be no great loss to the world, and I am thoroughly bored with life. I am like a man yawning at a ball; the only reason he does not go home to bed is that his carriage has not arrived yet.&quot;
*&quot;When I think of imminent and possible death, I think only of myself; some do not even do that. Friends, who will forget me tomorrow, or, worse still, who will weave God knows what fantastic yarns about me; and women, who in the embrace of another man will laugh at me in order that he might not be jealous of the departed—what do I care for them?&quot;
*&quot;Women! Women! Who will understand them? Their smiles contradict their glances, their words promise and lure, while the sound of their voices drives us away. One minute they comprehend and divine our most secret thoughts, and the next, they do not understand the clearest hints.&quot;
*&quot;There are two men within me – one lives in the full sense of the word, the other reflects and judges him. In an hour&#x27;s time the first may be leaving you and the world for ever, and the second? ... the second? ...&quot;
*&quot;To cause another person suffering or joy, having no right to do so—isn&#x27;t that the sweetest food of our pride? What is happiness but gratified pride?&quot;
*&quot;I&#x27;ll hazard my life, even my honor, twenty times, but I will not sell my freedom. Why do I value it so much? What am I preparing myself for? What do I expect from the future? in fact, nothing at all.&quot;
* Grushnitski (to Pechorin): &quot;Mon cher, je haïs les hommes pour ne pas les mépriser car autrement la vie serait une farce trop dégoûtante.&quot; (&quot;My friend, I hate men to avoid despising them because otherwise, life would become too disgusting a farce.&quot;)
* Pechorin (replying to Grushnitski): &quot;Mon cher, je méprise les femmes pour ne pas les aimer car autrement la vie serait un mélodrame trop ridicule&quot; (&quot;My friend, I despise women to avoid loving them because otherwise, life would become too ridiculous a melodrama.&quot;)
*&quot;Passions are merely ideas in their initial stage.&quot;
*&quot;I was prepared to love the whole world . . . I learned to hate.&quot;
*&quot;Whether I am a fool or a villain I know not; but this is certain, I am also most deserving of pity – perhaps more so than she. My soul has been spoiled by the world, my imagination is unquiet, my heart insatiate. To me everything is of little moment. I have become as easily accustomed to grief as to joy, and my life grows emptier day by day.&quot;
*&quot;That is just like human beings! They are all alike; though fully aware in advance of all the evil aspects of a deed, they aid and abet and even give their approbation to it when they see there is no other way out—and then they wash their hands of it and turn away with disapproval from him who dared assume the full burden of responsibility. They are all alike, even the kindest and wisest of them!&quot;
*&quot;Women love only the men they don&#x27;t know.&quot;

==Screen and stage adaptations==
In 1966, the anthology series &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; adapted the novel for television, in which Alan Bates starred as Grigory. It aired on September 28, 1966.

In 2011 Alex Mcsweeney adapted the novel into an English-language playscript. Previewed at the International Youth Arts Festival in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, UK in July, it subsequently premiered in August of the same year at Zoo Venues in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Critics received it positively, generally giving 4- and 5-star reviews.

In 2014, German stage director Kateryna Sokolova adapted the novel focusing on its longest novella, &quot;Princess Mary&quot;. The play, directed by Kateryna Sokolova, premiered at the Schauspielhaus Zürich on 28 May. The production received universal acclaim, especially praising it for not having lost &quot;neither the linguistic finesse nor the social paralysis of Lermontov’s Zeitgeist&quot;, both of which constitute the novel&#x27;s Byronic character.

On July 22, 2015, The Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow premiered a ballet adaptation of &quot;Hero of Our Time&quot;. The ballet was choreographed by San Francisco Ballet&#x27;s Choreographer in Residence, Yuri Possokhov, and directed by Kirill Serebrennikov - who is also the author of the libretto. The score was commissioned purposefully for this production and composed by Ilya Demutsky. This production focuses on three novellas from Lermontov&#x27;s novel - Bela, Taman, and Princess Mary.

<text>2K Czech, s.r.o. (formerly Illusion Softworks, a.s.) was a Czech video game developer based in Brno, founded as Illusion Softworks in 1997 by Petr Vochozka and Jan Kudera. The company was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in January 2008 and subsequently organised under the 2K label, becoming 2K Czech. The studio was merged into 2K&#x27;s Hangar 13 in 2017. The developer is best known for creating the &quot;Mafia&quot; series.

== History ==
===Illusion Softworks===
Illusion Softworks was established in 1997 in Brno by Petr Vochozka and Jan Kudera. The company succeeded Vochozka&#x27;s video game publisher, Vochozka Trading, through funding provided by Kudera&#x27;s Cash Reform fund. The team initially comprised only five people, including Vochozka and Kudera. The team would expand to 40 people by the release of Mafia in 2002.

The studio provided assistance to Silver Wish Games for the production of &quot;Wings of War&quot;, &quot;Chameleon&quot; and &quot;Circus Empire&quot;.

In September 2007, several Illusions Softworks employees left the studio to found The Easy Company, which went on to produce &quot;MotorM4X&quot; (2008).

===2K Czech===
On 8 January 2008, Take-Two Interactive announced that they acquired Illusion Softworks for an undisclosed sum. As a result of the acquisition, Illusion Softworks became part of Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s 2K label and was renamed to 2K Czech. According to Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s chief executive officer, Ben Feder, the agreement was made to expand the company&#x27;s &quot;strategic focus on owning high-value intellectual property&quot;. In July 2011, several employees that had left 2K Czech, along with former employees of Bohemia Interactive, founded Warhorse Studios, the studio behind 2018 video game &quot;Kingdom Come: Deliverance&quot;.

In September 2011, 40 employees were laid off from the company&#x27;s Brno studio, with a few others made redundant at its Prague studio. Both studios previously housed a total of 200 employees, with around 25% of them being cut due to the layoffs. In November 2012, 2K Czech began hiring for a new, announced project; at the time, 2K Czech had 188 employees. There were reported creative differences between developers within 2K Czech, regarding the direction of the third installment of the &quot;Mafia&quot; series, which had started production between late 2010 and early 2011, with the project being rebooted around seven times between 2011 and 2013.

=== Succession by Hangar 13 ===
2K announced in January 2014 that 2K Czech&#x27;s Prague office was to close, and that 10 employees (including the development of &quot;Mafia III)&quot; would be transferred to 2K&#x27;s headquarters in Novato, California, with most other employees moved to 2K Czech&#x27;s remaining Brno studio. Of an undisclosed number of employees that were laid off, some were later hired by Warhorse Studios. &quot;Mafia III&quot;&#x27;s development was later shifted to 2K&#x27;s new studio, Hangar 13, with 2K Czech receiving a supporting role. In 2017, the studio was merged into Hangar 13.

<text>Digital Planet (previously known as Click and originally Go Digital) was a radio programme broadcast on the BBC World Service presented by Gareth Mitchell. Alternating as contributors were Bill Thompson, Ghislaine Boddington and Angelica Mari, who comment on items in the programme and discuss them with Mitchell. The show, broadcast weekly, covered technology stories and news from around the world.

== History ==
From 2001 to 2005, it was presented by Tracey Logan and during that time it was one of the BBC&#x27;s few webcast programmes, with cameras providing a live feed. Regular guest presenter Gareth Mitchell, who had been with the show since 2001, took over as presenter full time on 11 January 2005.

Originally named Go Digital, the show was renamed &quot;Digital Planet&quot; on 28 March 2006. It was again renamed &quot;Click&quot; on 29 March 2011 to make it easier to recognise its status as a sister programme of the TV programme &quot;Click&quot;, which is broadcast on BBC News and BBC World News. The show&#x27;s running time was reduced from 28 minutes to 18 minutes. In the episode aired 1 May 2019, the show announced that it had renamed itself back to &quot;Digital Planet.&quot;

== Closure ==
On the 29th September 2022, shortly after celebrating its 21st anniversary with a special as live broadcast from the BBC’s Radio Theatre in Old Broadcasting House in London, it was proposed ending the show as part of a restructure of programming as part of the wider ‘Proposals for a digital-first World Service’.

At the end of the show broadcast on Tuesday 21st March 2023 it was announced by the host Gareth Mitchell that the following week&#x27;s episode would be the last ever edition.

After the end of &quot;Digital Planet&quot;, in April 2023, Mitchell and Thompson returned with a new technology podcast, &quot;The Gareth and BillCast&quot;.

At the end of October 2023, Ania Lichtarowicz, one of the producers of Digital Planet, released the first episode of a new weekly global technology podcast starring Gareth Mitchell along with new presenters and previous presenters: &quot;Somewhere on Earth Podcast&quot; 

== Show format and topics ==
&quot;Digital Planet&quot; covers a wide range of issues affecting technology. The first broadcast each week is also live (at 20:30 UK time on a Tuesday evening), whereas before the 2011 changes, it was recorded. The show is now around 27 minutes long. Often there are segments on technological solutions to problems facing charitable or humanitarian causes, with a speaker representing the cause being interviewed by Mitchell. One example is the segment on a screen saver which harnessed the power of idling home PCs to help perform complex mathematical calculations to help cure malaria.

Other topics covered have included: 
* Modern plane technology
* problems with smartphone set up
* Blu-ray Disc vs. HD DVD
* The use of open source software around the world

Usually views sent either by e-mail, Facebook, Twitter or using the BBC News website are read out and discussed briefly by the hosts.

A special pre- and post show session for podcast listeners is produced which cannot be heard by those listening to broadcast radio. The fan club&#x27;s Prezzi created a special picture for the show, which was framed, delivered and discussed on line, and held a Google Hangout during the show where listeners discussed the show in real time, and engaged with the presenters - see Thompson engaging with the Hangout on Air. The presenters were interviewed for the Project Kazimierz Podcast in 2015.

From 2016 to 2023, the &quot;Digital Planet Listeners&quot; Facebook group had a running theme hashtagged #FlatDarkStanleyNet in which Gareth Mitchell&#x27;s copy of Jamie Bartlett&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Net&quot; containing a bookmark (made by the illustrator Justine Rykiel) of Mitchell in his familiar checked shirt was passed around among listeners. It was based on the Flat Stanley Project. The bookmark and the book went around the world and were eventually returned to Mitchell.

<text>Richard Le Gallienne (20 January 1866 – 15 September 1947) was an English author and poet. The British-American actress Eva Le Gallienne (1899–1991) was his daughter by his second marriage to Danish journalist Julie Nørregaard (1863–1942).

==Life and career==
Richard Thomas Gallienne was born at West Derby, Liverpool, England, eldest son of Jean (&quot;John&quot;) Gallienne (1843-1929), manager of the Birkenhead Brewery, and his wife Jane (1839-1910), née Smith. He attended the (then) all boys public school Liverpool College. After leaving school he changed his name to Le Gallienne and started work in an accountant&#x27;s office in London. In 1883, his father took him to a lecture by Oscar Wilde in Birkenhead. He soon abandoned this job to become a professional writer with ambitions of being a poet. His book &quot;My Ladies&#x27; Sonnets&quot; appeared in 1887, and in 1889 he became, for a brief time, literary secretary to Wilson Barrett. In the summer of 1888 he met Wilde, and the two had a brief affair. Le Gallienne and Wilde continued an intimate correspondence after the end of the affair. Directly following this affair, Gallienne stayed with Joseph Gleeson White and his wife in Christchurch, Hampshire.

He joined the staff of the newspaper &quot;The Star&quot; in 1891 and wrote for various papers under the name &quot;Logroller&quot;. He contributed to &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, and associated with the Rhymers&#x27; Club.

His first wife, Mildred Lee, and their second daughter, Maria, died in 1894 during childbirth, leaving behind Richard and their daughter Hesper Joyce. After Mildred&#x27;s death he carried with him at all times, including while married to his second wife, an urn containing Mildred&#x27;s ashes. Rupert Brooke, who met Le Gallienne in 1913 aboard a ship bound for the United States but did not warm to him, wrote a short poem &quot;For Mildred&#x27;s Urn&quot; satirising this behaviour.

In 1897 he married the Danish journalist Julie Nørregaard. She became stepmother to Hesper, and their daughter Eva was born 11 January 1899. In 1901 and 1902, he was a writer for &quot;The Rambler&quot;, a magazine produced by Herbert Vivian intended to be a revival of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s periodical of the same name.

In 1903 Nørregaard left Richard, taking both of his daughters to live in Paris. Nørregaard later sent Hesper to live with her paternal grandparents in an affluent part of London while Eva remained with her mother. Julie later cited his inability to provide a stable home or pay his debts, alcoholism, and womanising as grounds for divorce. Their daughter Eva would grow up to take on some of her father&#x27;s negative traits, including womanising and heavy drinking.

Le Gallienne subsequently became a resident of the United States. He has been credited with the 1906 translation from the Danish of Peter Nansen&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Trilogy&quot;, but most sources and the book itself attribute it to Julie. They were divorced in June 1911. On 27 October 1911, he married Mrs. Irma Perry (née Hinton), whose previous marriage to her first cousin, the painter and sculptor Roland Hinton Perry, had been dissolved in 1904. Le Gallienne and Irma had known each other for some time and had jointly published an article as early as 1906. Irma&#x27;s daughter Gwendolyn Hinton Perry subsequently called herself &quot;Gwen Le Gallienne&quot; but was almost certainly not his natural daughter, having been born circa 1898.

From the late 1920s, Le Gallienne and Irma lived in Paris, where Gwen was by then an established figure in the expatriate bohème and where he wrote a regular newspaper column.

Le Gallienne lived in Menton on the French Riviera during the 1940s. During the Second World War he was prevented from returning to his Menton home and lived in Monaco for the rest of the war. His house in Menton was occupied by German troops and his library was nearly sent back to Germany as bounty. Le Gallienne appealed to a German officer in Monaco, who allowed him to return to Menton to collect his books. During the war Le Gallienne refused to write propaganda for the local German and Italian authorities and, with no income, once collapsed in the street owing to hunger.

In later times he knew Llewelyn Powys and John Cowper Powys.

Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; the stress was &quot;on the last syllable: &quot;le gal-i-enn&#x27;.&quot; As a rule I hear it pronounced as if it were spelled &#x27;gallion,&#x27; which, of course, is wrong.&quot; (Charles Earle Funk, &quot;What&#x27;s the Name, Please?&quot;, Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.)

A number of his works are now available online.

He also wrote the foreword to &quot;The Days I Knew&quot; by Lillie Langtry 1925, George H. Doran Company on Murray Hill New York.

Le Gallienne is buried in Menton in a grave whose lease (license No. 738 / B Extension of the Trabuquet Cemetery) does not expire until 2023.

==Exhibitions==
In 2016 an exhibition on the life and works of Richard Le Gallienne was held at the central library in his home city of Liverpool, England. Entitled &quot;Richard Le Gallienne: Liverpool&#x27;s Wild(e) Poet&quot;, it featured his affair with Oscar Wilde, his famous actress daughter Eva Le Gallienne and his personal ties to the city. The exhibition ran for six weeks between August and October 2016, and a talk about him was held at the Victorian Literary Symposium during Liverpool&#x27;s Literary festival the same year.

<text>Black Sheep is a 1996 American comedy film starring Chris Farley and David Spade. It is directed by Penelope Spheeris and written by Fred Wolf. The film also stars Tim Matheson, Christine Ebersole, and Gary Busey. The film follows a political aide who is assigned to control the brother of a candidate for Governor of Washington, who helps his brother&#x27;s campaign. It grossed $32.3 million during its U.S. theatrical run.

==Plot==
Mike Donnelly, a good-natured but loud and bumbling oddball of his family, is driving an advertisement truck to support his brother Al Donnelly&#x27;s campaign for Governor of Washington. His competition is the 8-year incumbent, Evelyn Tracy. Mike is chased by dogs while driving and crashes into a local movie theater. Al&#x27;s campaign manager, Roger Kovary, advises Al to get rid of Mike, but Al decides to have Mike campaign for him in town with the assistance of campaign aide Steve Dodds, who accepts the job in return for a spot on Al&#x27;s staff following the election. As Steve goes to pick up Mike, he hits crazed Vietnam veteran Sgt. Drake Sabitch, who ends up stealing his rental car.

Later on, Mike tries to stop underage kids from drinking, but incriminating pictures make it look like he was drinking with them, leading to his termination from a Pierce County recreation center. While packing up, he runs into a pair of thugs who set fire to the building, while the same photographer takes potentially incriminating pictures of Mike right after the thugs leave the scene of the fire. However, the first cop to arrive at the scene is Robbie Mieghem, a friend of Mike&#x27;s who lets him and Steve leave before the police arrive. The two take off in Mike&#x27;s car and, per Kovary&#x27;s instructions, head for a shack in rural Garfield County.

The next day, as Steve and Mike hang fliers, Steve tries to make a call via cell phone; while looking for a place with reception, Steve stumbles upon the home of the aforementioned Drake Sabitch - an old school bus with a TV, a hammock, a grill, and several weapons. While trying to find a high-ground to get reception on his phone, Steve accidentally loosens a rock in a pile of stones. Later on, as the guys play checkers, a huge boulder rolls down the mountain, almost completely knocking their cabin off its foundation; that night, a stormy wind blows the roof away and hail falls inside. The next day, Mike tries to talk to Al, but Kovary refuses, so Mike decides to head into Seattle that night to talk to Al, who is going on MTV&#x27;s Rock the Vote campaign. 
He impersonates a security guard and shouts down an unruly concertgoer, with clouds of steam coming out his ears. This ingratiates him to the security. Backstage he joins a lively party where they talk to him about how blacks are being kept down. After hanging out and bonding with the Rastafarians and being mistaken for his brother by Mudhoney, Mike cavorts around onstage assumed to be Al as he shouts various oddly misspoken political quotes and slogans (culminating to his yelling &quot;KILL WHITEY!&quot; once he waves to the Rastafarians as the crowd goes suddenly silent) as a shocked Al and Kovary helplessly watch. Because of his stunt, Al decides to no longer let Mike help him with the campaign, leaving Mike down. The next day, Steve and Mike sneak into Drake&#x27;s home (after dodging some hidden land mines) to watch Al&#x27;s debate on his TV. When Steve goes outside to use the restroom, he is attacked by Drake, but is saved by Mike, who beats the ex-soldier in unarmed combat. Drake is impressed by Mike&#x27;s fighting skill and befriends both men.

Governor Tracy, in hopes of sabotaging Al following their debate, purchases the pictures of Mike at the rec center fire and posts them on TV, therefore allowing Tracy to win the election. Mike notices that the total vote count is 1,882 for Garfield County, when in fact there are only 1,502 registered voters there; furthermore, Mike recognizes the two men who set the rec center on fire standing next to Tracy. Mike and Steve go to the Garfield County Courthouse, where they obtain the names of the voters in the election. They discover that over half the people who voted for Tracy have been dead for over ten years (including Drake&#x27;s father and grandfather), proving Tracy had rigged the elections. To get this to the people and Al, Mike and Steve borrow Robbie&#x27;s squad car to get to Governor Tracy&#x27;s victory party the following day.

At the party, the duo appears during Tracy&#x27;s victory speech and the police try to arrest Mike for arson. At the podium, Mike takes a gun from one of the cops and pretends to hold Steve hostage, while Drake shows up in time to prevent a sniper from shooting Mike and controls the crowd by threatening them with an RPG. Mike reveals Tracy&#x27;s election fraud, overturning the election results and making Al the winner.

Three months later, Steve is Al&#x27;s new assistant and advisor, replacing Kovary after earlier in the movie, he made Al choose between his career or being with his &quot;loser&quot; brother and as a result, Al fired him; Al offered Mike a job in his administration, but he declined since he got his job running the recreation center back; and Al has decreased crime rates in Washington. As Al and Steve enter a jet to go to a meeting, Mike&#x27;s jacket gets caught in the plane&#x27;s door, causing him to be trapped outside while it takes off.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator Lorne Michaels produced the film, which was directed by &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; director Penelope Spheeris. Michaels later said that the film was &quot;an act of desperation by Paramount,&quot; in that the movie studio had under-promoted Spade and Farley&#x27;s 1995 film, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; and was now looking to profit from the same comedy formula. Michaels had contentious battles with Paramount over the script of 1993&#x27;s &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;, and the animosity between the two camps spilled over into Farley&#x27;s contract with Paramount. Although his agent lined up possible roles for Farley in &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (for which he was offered $3 million) and &quot;Kingpin&quot;, Paramount remained firm on wanting another buddy comedy with Farley and Spade.

Having performed an uncredited rewrite on &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;, Fred Wolf wrote the script for &quot;Black Sheep&quot;. Wolf said the studio told him to &quot;deliver a finished script by midnight on Sunday, the last day Chris was contractually allowed to get out of the movie. If I didn&#x27;t have a finished script -- any finished script -- they were going to sue me.&quot; Wolf wrote 45 pages within a few days, and dropped the script off at Paramount 15 minutes before his deadline. After reading the script, Farley said that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t crazy&quot; about it, and only agreed to do the film after coaxing from David Spade.

Spheeris had notable disagreements with writer Fred Wolf and David Spade throughout the entire production of the film. Spheeris fired Wolf from the film three times (he was hired back twice by Farley and once by Lorne Michaels), then refused to speak to him and finally banned him from the set. Her relationship with Spade was equally as tumultuous. Speaking to Farley&#x27;s official biographer, she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever even smiled at anything David Spade&#x27;s ever done... I still have a recording of a message David left on my answering machine. He said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve spent this whole movie trying to cut my comedy balls off.&#x27;&quot; The two worked together again on the 1998 comedy &quot;Senseless&quot;.

The combination of bright lights on set and working under sunlight while filming &quot;Black Sheep&quot; caused permanent damage to David Spade&#x27;s eyes. Spade says of his condition: &quot;I have to wear a hat even indoors and flashes in particular freak me out. I even have to make them turn down the lights in the make-up trailers. I&#x27;ve become such a pain in the butt with this light-sensitive thing, it&#x27;s a wonder they don&#x27;t &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Black Sheep&quot; is the final appearance of Spade and Farley together. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 30% based on reviews from 33 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Chris Farley and David Spade reunite to diminishing returns in &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, a comedic retread that succumbs to a woolly plot and sophomoric jokes.&quot; 
Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film &quot;two big thumbs down very big thumbs way down,&quot; with Siskel admitting that &quot;Black Sheep&quot; was one of only three films he ever walked out on, the others being &quot;Million Dollar Duck&quot; and &quot;Maniac&quot;. Siskel stated several times that he did not like Chris Farley and thought of him as a terrible actor, stating at one point &quot;Chris Farley is not funny. I knew John Belushi, I knew John Candy, he&#x27;s no John Belushi or John Candy.&quot; Ebert (who gave the movie thumbs down) called it &quot;not only one of the worst comedies I&#x27;ve ever seen, but one of the least ambitious; it doesn&#x27;t even feel like they&#x27;re trying to make a good movie.&quot; A few weeks later, during their televised review of &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;, Ebert tried to defend Farley, saying that he thought Siskel was too hard on him, and that he believed with the right script Farley could be good in a film (he also said that during the initial episode but Siskel dissented &quot;he&#x27;s not good with any script. He just runs around screams and rolls around on the ground like a fat man&quot;.).

The opinions of other reviewers were mixed. In his review, Richard Leiby of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;Farley and Spade manage to wring humor from a series of juvenile setups and predictable pratfalls.&quot; Barry Walters of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; wrote that &quot;there isn&#x27;t one shred of slightly intellectual wit&quot; in the film.

&quot;Black Sheep&quot; was one of the final films reviewed by Jeffery Lyons and Michael Medved on their PBS television show &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; which was ultimately cancelled later in 1996 after this film&#x27;s release. Although both were fans of Farley, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; and director Penelope Spheeris, whose film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; they enjoyed due to its wit, they felt this film was offensive, unfunny and filled with needless slapstick.

<text>Wolfgang Johannes Puck (born July 8, 1949) is an Austrian chef and restaurateur.

==Early life==

Puck was born in Sankt Veit an der Glan, Austria. He learned cooking from his mother, who was a pastry chef. He took the surname of his stepfather, Josef Puck, after his mother&#x27;s remarriage. The marriage produced two younger sisters and a younger brother for Wolfgang.

==Career==
Puck trained as an apprentice under Raymond Thuilier at L&#x27;Oustau de Baumanière in Les Baux-de-Provence, at Hôtel de Paris in Monaco, and at Maxim&#x27;s Paris before moving to the United States in 1973 at age 24. After two years at La Tour in Indianapolis, Puck moved to Los Angeles to become chef and part owner of Ma Maison restaurant.

Following the 1981 publication of his first cookbook, &quot;Modern French Cooking for the American Kitchen&quot;, which was based on his Ma Maison recipes, Puck opened the restaurant Spago on the Sunset Strip in 1982. Fifteen years later, in 1997, Puck and Barbara Lazaroff, his then-wife and business partner, moved the award-winning Spago to Beverly Hills. It has been recognized as one of the Top 40 Restaurants in the U.S. since 2004. The Infatuation wrote that &quot;Spago made Wolfgang Puck the first (and maybe only) chef you and your grandma know by name.&quot;

In 1991, Puck opened his fourth restaurant, Granita, a seafood restaurant in Malibu, California. The restaurant closed in 2005.

Since 2003, Puck&#x27;s recipes have been syndicated worldwide to newspapers and websites by Tribune Content Agency.

Wolfgang Puck is active in philanthropic endeavors and charitable organizations. He co-founded the Puck-Lazaroff Charitable Foundation in 1982. The foundation supports the annual American Wine &amp; Food Festival which benefits Meals on Wheels; it has raised more than $15 million since its inception.

One of Wolfgang Puck&#x27;s signature dishes at his original restaurant, Spago, is house-smoked salmon pizza.

==Personal life==
Puck married Barbara Lazaroff in 1983, with whom he has two sons, Cameron and Byron. They were divorced in 2003. Barbara Lazaroff co-founded the Wolfgang Puck restaurants and continues to play a key role in the business. She has been instrumental in their interior design.

Puck became a U.S. citizen in 1999. His favorite food is macarons.

==Awards and honors==
In 1985, Puck received a Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in a ceremony at Denver, Colorado, presented by Awards Council member Ray Charles.

In 1993, Spago Hollywood was inducted into the Nation&#x27;s Restaurant News Fine Dining Hall of Fame. The next year it received the James Beard Restaurant of the Year Award. In 2002, Puck received the 2001–2002 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Service Show, &quot;Wolfgang Puck.&quot;

Spago Beverly Hills received a James Beard Foundation Outstanding Service Award in 2005. It was awarded two Michelin stars in the 2008 and 2009 Los Angeles Michelin Guide.

CUT Beverly Hills was awarded a Michelin star in 2007. In 2013, Puck was inducted into the Culinary Hall of Fame. In July 2016, CUT at the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore was awarded a Michelin Star.

On April 26, 2017, Puck received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for his work in the TV industry, located at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.

On May 20, 2017, Puck was named the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association (IFMA) 2017 Gold Plate Winner.

In June 2022, Puck was recognized by the International Hospitality Institute on the Global 100 in Hospitality, as one of the 100 Most Powerful People in Global Hospitality.

<doc id="1039326" wikidata="Q1632981" url="?curid=1039326" title="Almanon (crater)">
<text>Almanon is a lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged highlands in the south-central region of the Moon. It was named after Abbasid Caliph and astronomer Al-Ma&#x27;mun. It is located to the south-southeast of Abulfeda, and to the north-northeast of the smaller crater Geber. The crater chain designated Catena Abulfeda forms a line between the south rim of Abulfeda and the north rim of Almanon, continuing for a length of about 210 kilometers to the Rupes Altai scarp.

The rim of Almanon forms a slightly distorted circle, with outward bulges to the north and southwest. The crater pair Almanon A and Almanon B is attached to the exterior of the southern rim. The interior wall is wider along the eastern side than elsewhere. Small craters belonging to the Catena Abulfeda intrude slightly into the northeast rim. The outer wall is generally worn and lacks the crispness of a younger crater, but is not significantly impacted by subsequent cratering. The interior floor is relatively flat and lacks notable features other than a few tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Almanon.

<doc id="1039329" wikidata="Q1632535" url="?curid=1039329" title="Blank Check (film)">
<text>Blank Check (in the United Kingdom originally released as Blank Cheque) is a 1994 American comedy film directed by Rupert Wainwright and starring Brian Bonsall, Karen Duffy, Miguel Ferrer, James Rebhorn, Tone Lōc, Jayne Atkinson and Michael Lerner. It was released on February 11, 1994, by Walt Disney Pictures. The film follows a boy who inherits a blank check and uses it to buy a house under an alter ego but is soon being searched for by several members of the bank he cashed it under. The film received negative reviews and grossed $30.8 million domestically.

== Plot ==
Eleven-year-old Preston Waters laments his relative lack of money compared to his entrepreneurial older brothers and his white collar father, an investor. His situation regularly leads him to humiliating situations including having his brothers, 16-year-old Damian and 15-year-old Ralph, invade his bedroom to use as an office for their home business. He is also forced to attend his classmate Butch&#x27;s birthday party at Cliffside Fun Park, where he is unable to afford anything other than the kiddie rides because his father is very frugal with money.

One day, he gets involved in a bike accident with escaped convict Carl Quigley, who had just left a Zero Halliburton briefcase containing $1,000,000 in stolen cash in the care of bank president Edward H. Biderman to be laundered and retrieved by an associate the next day. Afraid of drawing attention from the police, Quigley hastily hands Preston a signed blank check and flees the scene.

Preston uses his computer to fill out the check himself for $1,000,000 and attempts to cash it the next day. He is taken to Biderman, who believes Preston is the associate named “Juice” that Quigley told him he was sending. Believing this is part of Quigley&#x27;s plan, Biderman fills Preston&#x27;s backpack with $1,000,000 in clean money and Preston leaves the bank just as the real Juice arrives for the money. An angered Quigley sets out to find Preston with Juice hoping to reclaim his stolen money and threatens Biderman&#x27;s family with death unless he comes along. Meanwhile, Preston goes on a spending spree, purchasing a large house and a limousine service with a chauffeur named Henry, and then fills the house with toys, gadgets, and electronics all in the name of a mysterious employer he creates named &quot;Macintosh&quot;, after his brothers&#x27; computer. Preston uses a computer program called MacSpeak as the voice of Mr. Macintosh when he needs to conduct business over the phone, otherwise Preston presents himself as Mr. Macintosh&#x27;s assistant.

Shay Stanley, a teller from the bank, seeks out Preston and his employer Mr. Macintosh, after the realtor who sold the house to Macintosh deposits $300,000 cash with her bank. Shay, an undercover FBI agent investigating Biderman for money laundering, is suspicious of the sudden flow of cash that has come through Biderman&#x27;s bank and follows the trail to Preston/Macintosh. Denied a meeting with Macintosh, Preston claims that he handles some of Macintosh&#x27;s financial affairs and the two end up going on a business date. Later, Preston throws an expensive birthday party for himself and Macintosh for which the party planner Yvonne takes at least $40,000 in cash from Preston, claiming it covers the fees for the event. Yvonne later gives Preston the party planning bill and cost which is $100,000. Preston invites Shay and Henry to the party, with many others showing up. At the party, Preston learns that he only has $332 left and that he cannot pay the planner what he owes for the party.

Still checking on the computer, his dad shows up talking to the so-called Macintosh. He tells him that if he sees Preston, to send him home because it is his birthday. Preston&#x27;s dad takes a moment talking about his son and is afraid how he doesn&#x27;t want to lose Preston and to grow up and to be like him not having fun. He leaves just before Preston starts crying. During the party, Preston tells Yvonne that Macintosh has left and there&#x27;s no more money, the planner shuts the party down, leaving Preston alone in the empty house. Quigley, Biderman, and Juice arrive and demand Preston return the money, only to find out Preston has spent all of it in six days; Biderman tells Quigley about adopting the Macintosh name in hopes of inheriting the new life he was hoping for. However, Preston escapes, and the three pursue him throughout the property. Although Preston manages to fend off his pursuers by using his various purchases, they eventually catch up to him, but the FBI shows up with Shay in time to save him.

Quigley announces that he is Macintosh, thinking that assuming the false identity would grant him the new life he was seeking after escaping prison. However, the FBI arrest Quigley for numerous crimes they intended to charge to Macintosh, along with Biderman and Juice as accomplices. Preston bids Henry farewell and shares a goodbye kiss with Shay before returning to his family to celebrate his birthday, now understanding that money cannot buy happiness and that family is what matters most.

== Cast ==
* Brian Bonsall as Preston Waters, aka Mr. Macintosh
* Karen Duffy as Shay Stanley
* Miguel Ferrer as Carl Quigley
* Michael Lerner as Edward Biderman
* Tone Lōc as Juice
* James Rebhorn as Fred Waters
* Jayne Atkinson as Sandra Waters
* Rick Ducommun as Henry
* Debbie Allen as Yvonne
* Chris Demetral as Damian Waters

== Production ==
&quot;Blank Check&quot; was filmed in Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas. The castle house that Preston buys was filmed at the Pemberton Castle (Fisher Gideon House) at 1415 Wooldridge Drive in Austin, a Texas Historical Landmark, which is now owned by filmmaker Robert Rodriguez. The theme park in the beginning of the movie was Six Flags Fiesta Texas; several of the park&#x27;s attractions, including The Rattler and Power Surge, were filmed in this movie.

The bank featured in the movie is in the historic Alamo National Bank Building. The bank lobby was featured and it has a 23-story office tower above it. The building opened in 1929, and today houses the Drury Plaza Hotel.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Blank Check&quot; debuted at number 3 at the US box office behind &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; and &quot;The Getaway&quot; with $5.4 million in its opening weekend. The film grossed $30.8 million in the United States and Canada.

=== Critical reception ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 9% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on nine critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that what was &quot;missing from this film is any trace of the joy in simple pleasures. Preston isn&#x27;t a very imaginative child; he&#x27;s a goodies gatherer.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that it &quot;looks like the best bet for family audiences in a season short on kiddie oriented entertainment. And it&#x27;s a movie that no parents in their right minds should let children see.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that &quot;[w]ith its contrived plot, its MTV-inspired montages and its blatant shilling for products, it is film as hard sell, and it comes with a decidedly suspect warranty. Its mercantile instincts are so primary it looks like an infomercial.&quot;

==== Kissing controversy ====
The appropriateness of a scene depicting a kiss between Preston and Shay near the end of the film has been called into question, particularly with Shay&#x27;s job as an agent with the FBI. Brian Bonsall was 11 years old at the time of filming, while Karen Duffy was 31.

In January 2017, &quot;Blank Check&quot; was made available on Netflix in the United States, which led many critics to review the film anew. &quot;Observer&quot;″s Dana Schwartz claimed the kissing scene left her feeling &quot;totally grossed out&quot;, while Kylie Queen from WJBQ described the act as &quot;borderline pedophilia&quot;. Writing for &quot;PinkNews&quot;, Lily Wakefield criticized the Disney+ streaming service for not featuring the &quot;Love, Simon&quot; spinoff series &quot;Love, Victor&quot;, deeming it to be &quot;too adult&quot;, but making &quot;Blank Check&quot; available to view with the kissing scene still intact.

=== Year-end lists ===
* 1st worst – Melinda Miller, &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;
* Worst (not ranked) – Bob Ross, &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;

<text>Dulce José Silva Pontes (; born 8 April 1969) is a Portuguese songwriter and singer who performs in many musical styles, including pop, folk, and classical music. She is usually defined as a world music artist. Her songs contributed to the 1990s revival of Portuguese urban folk music called fado.

==Biography==
Pontes was born in 1969 in Montijo, a town in the District of Setúbal, near Lisbon. She trained as a pianist, and started a career in singing after entering a competition in her hometown at the age of 18. She soon became an actress on Portuguese television and theatre. In 1991, she won the national music festival with her song &quot;Lusitana paixão&quot;, (known in English as &quot;Tell Me&quot;), which led her to represent Portugal at the Eurovision Song Contest. She finished 8th in the competition, which was at the time the third-best finish for a Portuguese performer.

Her interpretation of famous fado themes like &quot;Lágrima&quot; e &quot;Estranha Forma de Vida&quot;, earned her in the press the name of &quot;successor and heir to Amália Rodrigues&quot;.
Dulce Pontes started her career as a mainstream pop artist, but over the years she has evolved to become a world music singer. She blends traditional fado with contemporary styles and searches out new forms of musical expression. She introduced musical traditions of the Iberian Peninsula in her work, rediscovered many long forgotten popular tunes and found use for obsolete musical instruments. Her work is inspired and influenced not only by Iberian musical tradition, but also, African, Brazilian, Arabic and Bulgarian sounds. She sings mostly in her native Portuguese.

Dulce Pontes has collaborated with Cesária Évora, Caetano Veloso, Marisa Monte, Daniela Mercury, Carlos Núñez, the Chieftains, Kepa Junkera, Eleftheria Arvanitaki, George Dalaras, Andrea Bocelli (&quot;O Mar e Tu&quot;, duet sung by Pontes in Portuguese and Bocelli in Neapolitan, for his 1999 album &quot;Sogno)&quot;, Joan Manuel Serrat, Wayne Shorter, Trilok Gurtu, Christopher Tin for his albums &quot;Calling All Dawns&quot; (Grammy awarded) (on the song &quot;Se É Pra Vir Que Venha&quot;) and &quot;The Drop That Contained the Sea&quot; (on the song &quot;Passou o Verão&quot;) and others.

Her song &quot;Canção do Mar&quot; appeared on the soundtrack of Hollywood film &quot;Primal Fear&quot;. A 30-second piece of that same song serves as the theme to the NBC police drama &quot;Southland&quot;.

Her album &quot;Focus&quot; (2003) is the fruit of a collaboration with Italian composer Ennio Morricone with whom she has also toured and performed live. 
She sang in prestigious concert halls like Carnegie Hall in New York and the Royal Albert Hall in London, among many other places worldwide.

In June 2006, Pontes prepared her double LP &quot;O Coração Tem Três Portas&quot; (&quot;The Heart Has Three Doors&quot;). It was recorded live without an audience in Convent of the Order of Christ in Tomar and St Mary Church in Óbidos. According to the artist, it is &quot;her most personal and intimate album.&quot; It includes Portuguese folk music, mostly fado&quot;. It was released in December 2006.

Dulce Pontes with José Carreras in duet together, starred in the official opening of the international election of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007 with her theme &quot;One World&quot; (We are one).

In 2009, Pontes released &quot;Momentos&quot;, a career-spanning double disc collection that included previously unreleased tracks.

Her versatility in music styles shows also in her performances of Latin-American tango&#x27;s of Astor Piazzolla (for example &quot;Balada para un Loco&quot; and &quot;Maria de Buenos Aires&quot; or &quot;Volver&quot; by Carlos Gardel).

==Personal life==
She is the mother of a son, José Gabriel, who was born on 23 January 2002 in Lisbon and a daughter, Maria José, who was born on 24 January 2009 in Amadora.

<doc id="1039345" wikidata="Q1495767" url="?curid=1039345" title="Noise gate">
<text>A noise gate or simply gate is an electronic device or software that is used to control the volume of an audio signal. Comparable to a limiter, which attenuates signals &quot;above&quot; a threshold, such as loud attacks from the start of musical notes, noise gates attenuate signals that register &quot;below&quot; the threshold. However, noise gates attenuate signals by a fixed amount, known as the range. In its simplest form, a noise gate allows a main signal to pass through only when it is above a set threshold: the gate is &quot;open&quot;. If the signal falls below the threshold, no signal is allowed to pass (or the signal is substantially attenuated): the gate is &quot;closed&quot;. A noise gate is used when the level of the &quot;signal&quot; is above the level of the unwanted &quot;noise&quot;. The threshold is set above the level of the &quot;noise&quot;, and so when there is no main &quot;signal&quot;, the gate is closed. 

A common application is with electric guitar to remove hum and hiss noise caused by distortion effects units. A noise gate does not remove noise from the signal itself; when the gate is open, both the signal and the noise will pass through. Even though the signal and the unwanted noise are both present in open gate status, the noise is not as noticeable. The noise becomes most noticeable during periods where the main signal is not present, such as a bar of rest in a guitar solo. Gates typically feature &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;release&quot;, and &quot;hold&quot; settings and may feature a &quot;look-ahead&quot; function.

==Controls and parameters==

Noise gates have a &quot;threshold&quot; control to set the level at which the gate will open. More advanced noise gates have more features.

The &quot;release&quot; control is used to define the length of time the gate takes to change from open to fully closed. It is the fade-out duration. A fast release abruptly cuts off the sound, whereas a slower release smoothly attenuates the signal from open to closed, resulting in a slow fade-out. If the release time is too short, a click can be heard when the gate re-opens. Release is the second-most common control to find on a gate, after threshold.

The &quot;attack&quot; control is used to define the length of time the gate takes to change from closed to fully open. It is the fade-in duration.

The &quot;hold&quot; control is used to define the length of time the gate will stay fully open after the signal falls below the threshold, and before the release period is commenced. The hold control is often set to ensure the gate does not close during short pauses between words or sentences in a speech signal.

The &quot;range&quot; control is used to set the amount of attenuation to be applied to the signal when the gate is closed. Often there will be complete attenuation, that is no signal will pass when the gate is closed. In some circumstances, complete attenuation is not desired and the range can be changed.

Advanced gates have an external &quot;sidechain&quot;. This is an additional input that allows the gate to be triggered by another audio signal. A variation of a sidechained noise gate used in electronic music production is a &quot;trancegate&quot; or just simply &quot;gate&quot;, where the noise gate is not controlled by audio signal but a preprogrammed pattern, resulting in a precisely controlled chopping of a sustained sound.

Noise gates often implement hysteresis, that is, they have two thresholds: one to open the gate and another, set a few dB below, to close the gate. This means that once a signal has dropped below the close threshold, it has to rise to the open threshold for the gate to open, so that a signal that crosses over the close threshold regularly does not open the gate and cause chattering. A longer hold time also helps to avoid chattering, as described above.

==Roles==

The basic function of a noise gate is to eliminate sounds below a given threshold. Noise gates are commonly used in the recording studio and sound reinforcement. Rock musicians may also use small portable &quot;stompbox&quot; units to control unwanted noise from their guitar amplification systems. Band-limited noise gates are also used to eliminate background noise from audio recordings by eliminating frequency bands that contain only static.

==Audio noise reduction==
In audio post-processing, noise gating reduces steady noise sources such as rumble from LP records, hiss from audio tape, static from a radio or amplifier, and hum from a power system, without greatly affecting the source sound. An audio signal such as music or speech is broken up into many frequency bands by a collection of overlapping band-pass filters, and if the signal amplitude in any one band is lower than a preset threshold, then that band is eliminated from the final sound. This greatly reduces perceptible background noise because only the frequency components of the noise that are within the gated passbands survive.

The technique was implemented in real-time electronics in some audiophile record players as early as the 1980s, and is now commonly used in audio production post-processing, where software to Fourier transform the audio signal can yield a very detailed spectrum of the background noise. Common digital audio editing software packages such as CoolEdit and Audacity include easy-to-use digital noise gating code: the user selects a segment of audio that contains only static, and the amplitude levels in each frequency band are used to determine the threshold levels to be applied across the signal as a whole.

Noise gating works well when the static is steady and either narrowly confined in frequency (e.g. hum from AC power) or well below the main signal level (15 dB minimum is desirable). In cases where the signal merges with the background static (for example, the brushed drum sounds in the &quot;Sun King&quot; track on the Beatles album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;) or is weak compared to the noise (as in very faint tape recordings, the noise gating can add artifacts that are more distracting than the original static.

In the context of a multi-microphone recording session, noise gating is employed to reduce the leakage of sound into a microphone from sources other than the one the microphone was intended for. One example involves the mic-ing up of a drumkit. In most multi-mic drum recordings, one microphone will be used to capture the snare drum sound and another to capture the kick drum sound. The snare microphone will output a signal composed of a high level snare signal and a lower level kick drum signal (due to the further distance of the kick drum from the snare microphone). If the threshold level of the noise gate is set correctly, a snare drum signal can be isolated. To fully isolate the snare drum signal, the release rate has to be quite fast, which can cause the tail end of the snare sound to be &quot;chopped off&quot;. This can usually be remedied by the inclusion of one or more overhead microphones, which can act as a general &quot;audio glue&quot; for all the other gated sources.

Noise gates are useful when editing live recordings to remove background noise between passages or pieces of dialogue. However, care must be taken in setting the gates so they do not trigger due to spurious noises.

For vocal applications on stage, an optical microphone switch may be used rather than a noise gate. An infrared sensor senses if someone is in front of the microphone and switches on the microphone.

==Recording usages==

A good example of time-controlled noise gating is the well-known &quot;gated reverb&quot; effect heard on the drums on the Phil Collins hit single &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, created by engineer-producer Hugh Padgham, in which the powerful reverberation added to the drums is cut off by the noise gate after a few milliseconds, rather than being allowed to decay naturally. This can also be achieved by: sending the &quot;dry&quot; snare signal to the reverb (or other process) unit, inserting a noise gate on the path of the reverb signal and connecting the snare sound to the side chain of the gate unit. With the gate unit set to &quot;external sidechain&quot; (or &quot;external key&quot;), the gate will respond to the snare signal level and &quot;cut off&quot; when that has decayed below the threshold, not the reverberated sound.

It is a common production trick to use spurious combinations of side chain inputs to control longer, more sustained sounds. For example, a hi-hat signal can be used to control a sustained synthesized sound to produce a rhythmic melodic (or harmonic) signal which is perfectly in time with the hi-hat signal. A good example of this use of the device can be found on the Godley &amp; Creme concept album &quot;Consequences&quot;. The album&#x27;s story required the creation of a number of special sound effects that would convey the impression of natural disasters.

For the &quot;Fire&quot; sequence, Godley and Creme used a noise gate, triggered by the sound of multitracked voices, that created the &quot;voice&quot; of a raging bushfire. During the recording of this segment, each time the voice signal began, it triggered the noise gate to open up another channel, which carried a pre-recorded loop of a crackling sound (created by overdubbing the sound of Bubble Wrap being popped in front of a microphone). The combined voices and crackling created an eerie and quite convincing &quot;talking fire&quot; effect.

&quot;One thing I did that I think gave the album a certain sound was I Kepexed everything,&quot; said Alan Parsons, engineer on Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. &quot;Kepexes were very early noise gates, and we Kepexed not only going from the first sixteen-track to the second, but also on the mix. They were quite revolutionary at the time and they had a very individual sound. It was very effective on the heartbeats. That was a kick drum, and you hear the noise being modulated by a noise gate, which is an integral part of that sound.&quot;

===Multi-latch gating===
The invention of a technique, called multi-latch gating by Jay Hodgson, common in classical music recordings for years, is often credited to producer Tony Visconti, whose use on David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot; may have been the first in rock. Visconti recorded Bowie&#x27;s vocals in a large space using three microphones placed 9 inches (23 cm), 20 feet (6.1 m), and 50 feet (15.2 m) away, respectively. A different gate was applied to each microphone so that the farther microphone was triggered only when Bowie reached the appropriate volume, and each microphone was muted as the next one was triggered.

&quot;Bowie&#x27;s performance thus grows in intensity precisely as ever more ambience infuses his delivery until, by the final verse, he has to shout just to be heard...The more Bowie shouts to be heard, in fact, the further back in the mix Visconti&#x27;s multi-latch system pushes his vocal tracks [dry audio being perceived as front and ambience pushing audio back in the mix], creating a stark metaphor for the situation of Bowie&#x27;s doomed lovers shouting their love for one another over the Berlin wall.&quot;

===Trance gating===

Envelope following (also called trance gating because of its prevalence in trance music) is the use of a gate on a track additional to the one it attenuates, so called because the latter&#x27;s amplitude profile will then match or closely follow that of the first. Envelope following may be used to create syncopated rhythms or to tighten sloppy performances. For example, a synth pad may play whole notes while keyed to a guitar or percussion part. Examples include DJ Nexus&#x27;s &quot;Journey into Trance&quot; (1:11), Chic&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Dance&quot;, and Diana Ross&#x27;s &quot;Upside Down&quot;.

==Sound reinforcement==
Noise gates play an important role in drum mic&#x27;ing in heavy metal shows. The drum and cymbal mic channels will typically have noise gates so that the mics will only be turned on when the specific drum or cymbal is being played. This dramatically reduces &quot;bleeding&quot; between the drum mics. This is used to reduce audio feedback triggered by other highly amplified sounds onstage.

<text>Borgosatollo (Brescian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It is bounded by other communes of Brescia, Castenedolo, Montirone, Poncarale and San Zeno Naviglio, and situated directly south of Brescia, in the plain.
Borgosatollo&#x27;s area include also two frazioni, Gerole and Piffione.

== Symbol ==
The coat of arms of the town was established by Royal Decree of August 28, 1931 following a request made last year by the municipal administration to the Heraldic Florence on the basis of a representation in stone placed on the arch of the entrance of the municipal building. The shield is an sannitico type, stamped by the crown of Italian municipalities regulate, and depicts a sheep rampant on blue. The two branches are in decusse laurel, left, and oak, right, both presented with fruits.

Bosio (2006) reports the popular tradition according to which the original coat of arms had a boar rampant on green background, as demonstrated by some versions of the banner municipal.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
Until the thirteenth century, the territory of Borgosatollo was uncultivated due to the characteristics of the soil, substantially gravelly, and due to the lack of an irrigation network. In that period, on the initiative of the municipal republic of Brescia and of the bishop Berardo Maggi, derivations of the Brescia Naviglio Grande were built, such as the Naviglio Inferiore, the San Pola canal, the Mora or Avogadra and the Vescovada, which allowed the land to be cleared up to at the present via San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi.

Borgosatollo in the fourteenth century was involved in the wars between Scaligeri and Visconti, given its strategic position. According to Mazza (1986) two castles were built: one on the Naviglio, near the bridge along the road that connected Poncarale to Castenedolo and Rezzato, and one near the current Castle district, to defend the inhabitants.

During the second half of the fourteenth century, the Visconti had become stable rulers of the Brescia area and decided to repopulate the areas devastated by wars and the plague of 1348 with inhabitants from the Bergamo valleys of the Scalve and Seriana valleys. Borgosatollo also saw the population of new families coming from those areas.

Around 1380, the inhabitants of the town who had not obtained Brescia&#x27;s citizenship formed in common with a system, that of the Vicinias, which was maintained in vogue until 1797. According to the Viscount Estimus of 1385, the municipality belonged to the square of Capriano with Mairano.

=== After the Italian Unification ===
Following the events of the second Italian war of independence (1859), Borgosatollo became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia (from 1861, the Kingdom of Italy). On the basis of the decree Rattazzi was included in Rezzato&#x27;s IV district, belonging to the District I of the new province of Brescia.

At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the company Facchi &amp; Fisogni was established in the country and was the first to experiment in Italy with the fractional distribution system of milk, both whole and skimmed, distributing it in glass bottles throughout the provincial capital.

With royal decree 4 December 1927, n. 2350, the nearby town of Montirone was abolished, the territory of which was assigned to that of Borgosatollo. In 1955 the Montironese municipal autonomy was restored, which materialized the following year.

== Language ==
In the territory of Borgosatollo, alongside Italian, is also spoken the Lombard language primarily in its variant of Brescian dialect.

== Frazioni ==
The municipal statute recognizes the presence of two frazioni:
* Gerole
* Piffione
In the territory of the municipality are the following locations: Colombo, Fuserino, Gorgone, Pradossi, Sorek, Venezia.

== Main sights ==

=== Church of Santa Maria Annunciata ===
It is the parish church of the town, dedicated to the Annunciation of Mary. The previous factory was raised between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The current building was built on a project by Antonio Marchetti in the second half of the eighteenth century: the first stone was laid on August 1, 1762 and the work continued in the following decades. The interior is punctuated by architraved columns and triangular tympanums. The Annunciation and the Last Supper are the work of Sante Cattaneo, while the Holy Trinity with Saints Barnabas, Agostino and Monica is by Pietro Muttoni known as the Old Man. The attribution of the author of the work Sant&#x27;Antonio and the Immaculate Conception is uncertain, as are the nine broad bricks containing the life of Mary. The decorations are the work of Pietro Scalvini.

=== Church of Santissima Trinità ===
The church of the Holy Trinity is a building design with a single nave. It is located on the driveway for Ghedi and is dedicated to the Christian dogma of the Trinity.

It was built in the fifteenth century and was used as a leper hospital during the plague of 1630.

=== St. Michael the Archangel ===
Build around the thirteenth century, is now on road 23 between Borgosatollo and Montirone.

It still has some frescoes in the apse.

== Transport ==

The Borgosatollo&#x27;s area is cross by Brescia-Parma railway. Until the early twentieth century, it was running a train station, later abandoned and converted into a private residence.

The inhabited center and the hamlet of Piffione are crossed by the provincial 23 Borgosatollo-Montirone which joins north on the former Brescia-Cremona state road and south on the provincial 24 Chiaviche-Cadimarco. Provincial 77 begins from the center of Borgosatollo, connecting the town to the nearby town of Castenedolo, near the Alpine resort.

The Borgosatollese territory is crossed to the west by the A21 Turin-Piacenza-Brescia motorway. Close to the municipal boundaries in the south there is the Ospitaletto-Montichiari motorway link that serves Borgosatollo through the homonymous highway exit. In addition to this, the closest toll booths are those of Brescia Centro, in Brescia, and Brescia Sud, in the territory of Poncarale.

The Brescia-Parma railway runs south-west of the Borgosatollese area. Until the early twentieth century, a railway station was in operation, later abandoned and converted into a private home.

The municipality is part of the urban transport network of the province of Brescia and is therefore served by the 14 Metro Volta-Borgosatollo-Capodimonte line, with some Brescia-Capodimonte station runs.

In the vicinity of Borgosatollo there is also the &quot;Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio&quot; airport of Brescia-Montichiari, mainly interested in the transport of goods.

== Sports ==

=== Football ===
In Borgosatollo there were initially two football teams, today united in the same football group:

the A.C. Borgosatollo 1982 Calcio company born in 1982 which played in the Lombardy group of promotion whose colors are white and red.

Real Calcio Borgosatollo. Whose colors are yellow and blue.

=== Tamburello ===
There is a tamburello team, the A.T. Borgosatollo who was champion of Italy in 2001 (the only Brescia team to win the title in Serie A) and champion of Europe in the seasons 2000, 2001 and 2002.

=== Other sports ===
There are also volleyball and basketball teams.

Also important is the cycling of which the greatest local export was Benedetto Pola, world cycling champion to whom the town&#x27;s sports center is named.

<doc id="1039372" wikidata="Q1464666" url="?curid=1039372" title="Baize">
<text>Baize is a coarse woollen (or in cheaper variants cotton) cloth, similar in texture to felt, but more durable.

==History==
A mid-17th-century English  – much quoted in histories of ale and beer brewing in England – refers to 1525:

&quot;Heresies&quot; refers to the Protestant Reformation, while &quot;bays&quot; is the Elizabethan spelling for &quot;baize&quot; (though &quot;bay&quot; and &quot;baize&quot; eventually came to describe two similar but distinguishable types of cloth, as described below).

==Applications==
Baize is often used on billiard tables to cover the and , and is also used on different kinds of gaming tables (usually gambling) such as those for blackjack, baccarat, craps and other casino games. It is also found as a writing surface, particularly on 19th century pedestal desks.

The surface finish of baize is coarse, thus increasing rolling resistance and perceptibly slowing billiard balls. Baize is available with and without a perceptible nap. Snooker, in which understanding nap effects is part of the game, uses the nappy variety, while pool and carom billiards use the napless type.

For gaming use, baize is traditionally dyed green, in mimicry of a lawn &quot;(see Cue sport, &quot;History&quot;)&quot;, though wide variety of table colours have become accepted. Bay was similar material to baize, but lighter in weight and with a shorter nap.

==Idioms and catchphrases==
* &quot;Let&#x27;s get the boys on the baize!&quot; has been a catchphrase of BBC TV snooker presenter Rob Walker since 2008.
* At one time, &quot;the green baize door&quot; (a door to which cloth had been tacked to deaden noise) in a house separated the servants&#x27; quarters from the family&#x27;s living quarters; hence the phrase&#x27;s usage as a metonym for domestic service. Moving men in the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Railway Children&quot; wore green baize aprons.

<text>Kurnool is a city in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. It formerly served as the capital of Andhra State (1953–1956). The city is often referred to as &quot;The Gateway of Rayalaseema&quot;. Kurnool is also famous for Diamond hunting as diamonds can be found in the barren land of Kurnool after the top layers of soil are washed away by the monsoon rains. It also serves as the district headquarters of its Kurnool district. census, it is the fifth most populous city in the state with a population of 484,327. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra river. Although the area has been inhabited for thousands of years, modern Kurnool was founded in the 16th century CE with the construction of the Konda Reddy Fort.

== Etymology ==
The original name of Kurnool is found in historical records as &quot;Kandanavōlu&quot; or &quot;Kandanōlu&quot;. It used to be a crossing on the Tungabhadra River, where the bullock cart caravans are believed to have greased their wheels (&quot;kandana&quot; being a reference to grease). The city is often referred to as &quot;The Gateway of Rayalaseema&quot;.

== History ==

=== Palaeolithic era ===
The Ketavaram rock paintings from the Palaeolithic era and are 18 kilometres from Kurnool. Also the Jurreru Valley, Katavani Kunta and Yaganti in Kurnool District have some important rock art and paintings in the vicinity that may be dated from 35,000 to 40,000 years ago.

Ashoka&#x27;s rock edicts were inscribed in the 3rd century BCE. The inscription is in Prakrit language and Brahmi script. Both the major and minor edits are found at Erragudi (also called the Yerragudi or Jonnagiri site). These are among the oldest discovered inscriptions in India. The site is close to the Andhra-Karnataka border, in Kurnool district. It is an ASI protected site under Indian law.

Belum Caves are geologically and historically important caves in the district. There are indications that Jain and Buddhist monks were occupying these caves centuries ago. Many Buddhists relics were found inside the caves. These relics are now housed in the Museum at Ananthapur. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) found remnants of vessels and other artifacts of the pre-Buddhist era and has dated the remnants of vessels found in the caves to 4500 BC.

=== Vijayanagara era ===
Little was known about Kurnool town before the 11th century. The earliest knowledge of this settlement dates from the 11th century. It has developed as a transit place on the southern banks of the river Tungabhadra.

Ruled by the Cholas in the 12th century and later taken over by the Kakatiya dynasty in the 13th century, Kurnool developed into a transit point on the southern banks of the Tungabhadra River. It eventually fell under the rule of a jaghirdar before becoming a part of the Vijayanagar dynasty.

<text>Forbidden Games () is a 1952 French war drama film directed by René Clément and based on François Boyer&#x27;s novel &quot;Les Jeux Interdits&quot;.
While not initially successful in France, the film was a hit elsewhere. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, a Special Award as Best Foreign Language Film in the United States, and a Best Film from any Source at the British Academy Film Awards.

==Plot==
It is June 1940, during the Battle of France. After five-year-old Paulette&#x27;s parents and pet dog die in a German air attack on a column of refugees fleeing Paris, the traumatized child meets 10-year-old Michel Dollé whose peasant family takes her in. She quickly becomes attached to Michel. The two attempt to cope with the death and destruction that surrounds them by secretly building a small cemetery among the ruins of an abandoned watermill, where they bury her dog and start to bury other animals, marking their graves with crosses stolen from a local graveyard, including one belonging to Michel&#x27;s brother. Michel&#x27;s father first suspects that Michel&#x27;s brother&#x27;s cross was stolen from the graveyard by his neighbour. Eventually, the father finds out that Michel has stolen the cross.

Meanwhile, the French gendarmes come to the Dollé household in order to take Paulette. Michel cannot bear the thought of her leaving and tells his father that he would tell him where the stolen crosses are, but in return he should not give Paulette to the gendarmes. When his father doesn&#x27;t keep his promise, Michel destroys the crosses by throwing them into the stream. Paulette ends up going to a Red Cross camp, but at the end of the film is seen running away into a crowd of people in the camp, crying for Michel and then for her mother.

==Cast==
* Georges Poujouly as Michel Dollé
* Brigitte Fossey as Paulette
* Amédée as Francis Gouard
* Laurence Badie as Berthe Dollé
* Suzanne Courtal as Madame Dollé
* Lucien Hubert as Dollé
* Jacques Marin as Georges Dollé
* Pierre Merovée as Raymond Dollé
* Louis Saintève as the Priest

==Reception==
The film was widely praised among critics, whose &quot;howling protests&quot; were heard at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival where it was not an &quot;official entry of France&quot;; instead, it was &quot;screened on the fringe of the Competition.&quot;

The film was entered into competition at the 13th Venice International Film Festival; festival organizers at first considered the film ineligible because it had been screened at Cannes; it ended up receiving the Golden Lion, the Festival&#x27;s highest prize.

Upon its release, it was lambasted by some, who said it was a &quot;vicious and unfair picture of the peasantry of France&quot;; in France, 4,910,835 theater tickets were sold, making the most successful film at the French box office in 1952. Following its December 1952 release in the United States, Bosley Crowther called it a film with &quot;the irony of a &quot;Grand Illusion&quot;, the authenticity of a &quot;Harvest&quot; and the finesse of French films at their best&quot;; according to Crowther, the film is a &quot;brilliant and devastating drama of the tragic frailties of men, clear and uncorrupted by sentimentality or dogmatism in its candid view of life.&quot;
At the 25th Academy Awards, &quot;Forbidden Games&quot; won an out-of-competition Special Award as Best Foreign Language Film. In December 1952, at the 24th National Board of Review Awards it was chosen as one of that year&#x27;s five top foreign films. At the 1952 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, it won for Best Foreign Language Film.

In 1954, it was BAFTA&#x27;s Best Film from any Source; in 1955, at the 27th Academy Awards, François Boyer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story; Philip Yordan won, for his work on &quot;Broken Lance&quot;.

Decades after its release, David Ehrenstein called it &quot;deeply touching&quot; and wrote: &quot;Fossey&#x27;s is quite simply one of the most uncanny pieces of acting ever attempted by a youngster. Clément’s sensitivity doubtless accounts for much of what we see here, but the rest is clearly Fossey’s own.&quot;

&quot;Forbidden Games&quot; has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews, and an average rating of 8.8/10.

Roger Ebert added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; collection in 2005, writing: &quot;Movies like Clement&#x27;s &quot;Forbidden Games&quot; cannot work unless they are allowed to be completely simple, without guile, transparent. Despite the scenes I have described, it is never a tear-jerker. It doesn&#x27;t try to create emotions, but to observe them.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The main theme of the soundtrack is a guitar arrangement of the melody &quot;Romance,&quot; performed by Narciso Yepes.

==Home media==
&quot;Forbidden Games&quot; was released on Laserdisc in 1988 by Criterion Collection (under license of Turner and MGM/UA Home Video), who later also released it on DVD in 2004 by license of Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment Co.

<text>The 1908 Canadian federal election was held on Monday October 26, 1908 to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 11th Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberal Party of Canada was re-elected for a fourth consecutive term in government with a majority government. The Liberals lost four seats and a small share of the popular vote.

Sir Robert Borden&#x27;s Conservatives and Liberal-Conservatives won ten additional seats.

This was the first election in which Alberta and Saskatchewan voted as provinces. Following their creation in 1905, the two new provinces continued to be represented by MP&#x27;s initially elected under the old Northwest Territories riding boundaries, some of which straddled the new provincial border. The remainder of the Northwest Territories that previously had Parliamentary representation lost it, although parts of the NWT would gain or re-gain representation after being added to Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec in 1912. A seat would not be created for the NWT itself again (which then contained the modern NWT and Nunavut) until 1949.

This is the most recent election in which a prime minister was able to lead their party to a fourth consecutive mandate.

<text>Off-roading is the act of driving or riding in a vehicle on unpaved surfaces such as sand, dirt, gravel, riverbeds, mud, snow, rocks, or other natural terrain. Off-roading ranges from casual drives with regular vehicles to competitive events with customized vehicles and skilled drivers.

==Off-road vehicle==

Off-road vehicles are either capable of or specifically developed for off-road driving. These vehicles often have features designed specifically for use in off-road conditions such as suspension lifts, off-road tires, skid plates, snorkels, roll cages, or strengthened drivetrains.

== Types of recreational off-roading ==
=== Dune bashing ===

Dune bashing is a specific form of off-roading performed on sand dunes.

Dune Buggies, Sport-utility vehicles, and ATVs are often used. Vehicles driven on sand dunes are often equipped with a roll cage for safety in the case of an overturn. The tire pressure is often reduced to gain more traction by increasing the footprint of the tire and lowering the ground pressure of the vehicle on the sand, comparable to a person wearing snowshoes to walk on snow without sinking. Some cars are equipped with beadlock wheels, which allow tire pressure to be lowered even further without risking separation of the tire and rim. 

Upon entering the desert, it is customary for drivers to meet with a pack of other vehicles and a group leader before proceeding. The group leader then leads the pack through the stunts in a single file line. The rationale for this technique is to prevent drivers from becoming disoriented and getting lost.

=== Off-road racing ===
==== Desert racing ====
High-speed racing in the desert includes chases and racing at maximum speed through rough desert terrain with numerous pots and bumps. Drivers often use rear-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive trucks with long-travel suspension and wide stance between the front enlarged tires, which maintains optimal stability at high speed. These types of trucks are often called Trophy trucks or PreRunners.

==== Rock racing ====
Rock racing involves driving over rocks, but unlike rock crawling, does not specify penalties for striking cones, backing up, or winching. In addition, rock racing incorporates a level of high-speed racing that is not characteristic of rock crawling.

=== Mudding and mud plugging ===
Mudding is off-roading through an area of wet mud or clay, leading to extremely low traction and problems with moving forward. The goal is to drive as far as possible without getting stuck. There are many types of tires that are often used for this activity, including balloon tires, mud-terrain tires and paddle tires. The activity is popular in the United States, although it is illegal on public land due to the environmental impact.

Mud plugging, as practiced in the United Kingdom, refers to the motorsport of classic trials, where the main objective is to complete a challenging course of (mostly unpaved) roads and (often muddy, and frequently uphill) off-road terrain.

This form of motorsport is one of the oldest to survive to this day, dating back at least to the 1920s.

=== Rock crawling ===
Rock crawling involves driving over rocky terrain, with the goal being to get as far as possible with the fewest penalties. Penalties are received for striking cones, using a winch to get unstuck, going out of bounds, and going in reverse. These rules lead to the sport being technical, with drivers having to plan ahead to reduce the penalties they receive. Vehicles used for rock crawling are usually modified with different tires, suspension components that allow greater axle articulation, and changes in the differential gear ratio to obtain characteristics suitable for low-speed operation for traversing obstacles. Commonly, rock crawlers have a &quot;spotter&quot;, who is an assistant on foot by the vehicle to provide information about areas out of the driver&#x27;s field of view
=== Competitive trials ===
All progress is made at low speed and the emphasis is on skill rather than on finishing first, although trialing can be highly competitive. There are three traditional forms of off-road trialing. During some competitive events, such as the Turkey Run in Idaho and other events around the United States, point systems may be used to determine rewards.

==== RTV trialing ====
RTV (Road Taxed Vehicle) trialing is the most common form of trialing. As the name suggests, it is for vehicles that are road-legal (and thus required to pay road tax). This excludes vehicles that are highly modified or specially built. RTV-class vehicles can carry a wide range of suspension modifications, as well as off-road tires (provided they are road-legal), recovery winches, raised air intakes, etc. Vehicles on RTV trials are usually best described as &quot;modified from standard&quot;—they use the standard chassis, drive-train, and body that the vehicle was built with, but are fitted with a wide array of modifications to assist in the trailing. Whilst modification is not necessarily required for an RTV trial, at the very least the vehicle would be expected to have some underbody and over-the-body protection such as skid plates or roll cages, often made from durable stainless steel, aluminium or mild steel. RTV courses are intended to be non-damaging and driven at little more than a walking pace and a course properly laid out would be drivable without damage. However, the terrain usually includes steep slopes, water, side slopes, deep ruts, and other obstacles that could potentially damage a vehicle if mistakes are made or poor driving techniques are used. As such, the use of modifications can increase the chances of success.

RTV trials usually take place on farmland, a quarry site, or at a dedicated off-road driving center and are usually organized by a dedicated trialing body (such as the All-Wheel Drive Club or the Association of Land Rover clubs in the UK, or by a vehicle owner&#x27;s club. The course consists of 10 to 12 &quot;gates&quot; marked by two garden canes (sticks) and are vertically placed. The gates are just wide enough to get a standard vehicle through. Vehicles start in a stagger, proceeding one by one, and are deemed to have cleared a gate if at least one of the front wheel hubs passes between the canes. The vehicle&#x27;s attempt ends when it comes to a stop (depending on the exact level of skill the trial is aimed at any stopping may end the attempt, or a few seconds may be allowed). Long-wheelbase vehicles are usually allowed to perform a three-point turn if needed, providing the driver declares where the turn is going to be made before they attempt the course (this puts a strong emphasis on ground-reading ability). This can also be called a &quot;shunt&quot;, where the driver has to attempt a gate and then shout &quot;shunt&quot;. They are then allowed a space of one and a half car lengths to reverse and line the car better to enter through the gate

The course between the gates is a &quot;section&quot;: between the start line and the first gate is &quot;Section 1&quot;, the part between the first and second gates is &quot;Section 2&quot; and so on. An RTV course is often laid out so that each section is progressively more difficult, although this is not always the case. If a driver fails to complete Section 1 they are given 10 points. If the attempt ends in Section 2, 9 points are awarded, etc. A clear round results in gaining only 1 point. A day&#x27;s event will consist of many different courses and the driver with the lowest score is the winner.

Since the terrain covered in RTV trials should be well within the capabilities of any reasonably capable vehicle (even in standard form), these trials emphasize driver skill and ground-reading abilities. Skill and experience have a larger bearing on success than having a well-equipped and modified car.

==== CCV trialing ====

Cross Country Vehicle (CCV) trialing is the next step up from RTV trialing and is open to non-road-legal vehicles, which greatly increases the scope for modification. The terrain covered will be of greater difficulty than that found on an RTV trial. Since there is a risk of touching rocks and trees with the bodywork, CCV trialing will usually require more careful use of speed to get the vehicle across certain obstacles will attempting to mitigate the risk of vehicle damage. Whilst no trial is intended to be vehicle-damaging, mistakes and accidents are inevitable. A standard-specification vehicle would not be expected to be able to complete a CCV course, but it would still be possible.

The event is run along the same lines as RTV, with a course made up of cane-marked gates.

CCV trialing differs greatly from RTV trials in the vehicles used. Since CCV judges adopt an &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude, CCV trials rely on having the correct vehicle to a much greater extent than in an RTV trial. Competitors can design and build vehicles that are much more optimized for off-road use, than in the lower ranks of trialing. CCV vehicles have powerful engines, high ground clearance, light, minimalist bodywork, and good approach and departure angles. For many years, in the UK, the ultimate CCV vehicle could be built by taking the chassis of a Range Rover, removing the body, cutting the chassis down to an 80-inch wheelbase, and attaching it to the body of a Series I Land Rover, retaining the Range Rover&#x27;s V8 engine and coil-spring suspension in a light, maneuverable body. In recent years, the value of early Land Rovers and Range Rovers has risen to the extent that this is no longer practical. CCV trailers now usually base their vehicles around Land Rover Defenders or a standard 100-inch chassis from a Range Rover or Series I Discovery. The Suzuki SJ series of vehicles also make good bases for CCV-spec vehicles. Some vehicles are specially built, taking the form of light &quot;buggies&quot; with tractor tires and &quot;fiddle&quot; brakes (fiddle brakes give the ability to lock a wheel, which enables much better turning, better control descending hills, traction control by slowing or locking the spinning wheel) for the best performance.

Vehicles are required to meet certain safety regulations. Roll-cages must be fitted and be built to a suitable standard, recovery points must be fitted front and rear and fuel tanks must meet certain standards. A 4-point harness for all occupants is required and a fire extinguisher is recommended.

== Off-roading events ==

In some countries off-road activities are strictly regulated, while others promote cross-country off-road endurance events like the Dakar Rally, Spanish Baja, Africa Eco Race, Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge, Russian Baja Northern Forest, King of the Hammers, San Felipe 250 and Baja 500 &amp; 1000, which are a test of navigation skills and machine durability. Off-road parks and motocross tracks also host several events and may be the only legal place to off-road in the area.

== Criticism of ORV use ==

=== Environmental impact ===

Off-road vehicle use on public land has been criticized by some members of the U.S. government and environmental organizations including the Sierra Club and The Wilderness Society. They have noted several consequences of illegal ORV use such as pollution, trail damage, erosion, land degradation, possible species extinction, and habitat destruction which can leave hiking trails impassable. ORV proponents argue that legal use taking place under planned access along with the multiple environment and trail conservation efforts by ORV groups will mitigate these issues. Groups such as the BlueRibbon Coalition advocate for the responsible use of public lands for off-road activities.

Noise pollution is also a concern and several studies conducted by Montana State University, California State University, University of Florida and others have cited possible negative behavioral changes in wildlife as the result of some ORV use.

Some U.S. states have laws to reduce noise generated by off-road and non-highway vehicles. Washington is one example: &quot;State law requires off-road and other non-highway vehicles to use specified noise-muffling devices (RCW 46.09.120(1) (e) maximum limits and test procedures). State agencies and local governments may adopt regulations governing the operation of non-highway vehicles on property, streets, or highways within their jurisdiction, provided they are not less stringent than state law (RCW 46.09.180 regulation by local political subdivisions)&quot;.

=== Mojave desert controversy ===
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) supervises several large off-road vehicle areas in California&#x27;s Mojave Desert.

In 2009, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled against the BLM&#x27;s proposed designation of additional off-road use on designated open routes on public land. According to the ruling, the BLM violated its regulations when it designated approximately of off-road vehicle routes in 2006. According to Judge Illston the BLM&#x27;s designation was &quot;flawed because it does not contain a reasonable range of alternatives&quot; to limit damage to sensitive habitat, as required under the National Environmental Policy Act. Illston found that the Bureau had inadequately analyzed the route&#x27;s impact on air quality, soils, plant communities and sensitive species, such as the endangered Mojave fringe-toed lizard, pointing out that the United States Congress has declared that the California Desert and its resources are &quot;extremely fragile, easily scarred, and slowly healed&quot;.

The court also found that the BLM failed to follow route restrictions established in the agency&#x27;s conservation plan, resulting in the establishment of hundreds of illegal OHV routes during the previous three decades. The plan violated the BLM&#x27;s regulations, specifically the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The ruling was considered a success for a coalition of conservation groups including the Friends of Juniper Flats, Community Off-road Vehicle Watch, California Native Plant Society, The Center for Biological Diversity, The Sierra Club, and The Wilderness Society who initiated the legal challenge in late 2006.

=== Roadless area conservation ===
Many U.S. national parks have discussed or enacted roadless rules and partial or total bans on ORVs. To accommodate enthusiasts, some parks like Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida, were created specifically for ORVs and related purposes. However, such designations have not prevented damage or abuse of the policy.

=== Public statements ===
In 2004, several environmental organizations sent a letter to Dale Bosworth, Chief of the United States Forest Service, and described the extent of damage caused by ORV use, including health threats to other people:
It is well-established that the proliferation of off-road vehicles and snowmobile use places soil, vegetation, air and water quality, and wildlife at risk through pollution, erosion, sedimentation of streams, habitat fragmentation and disturbance, and other adverse impacts to resources. These impacts cause severe and lasting damage to the natural environment on which human-powered and equestrian recreation depends and alter the remote and wild character of the backcountry. Motorized recreation monopolizes forest areas by denying other users the quiet, pristine, backcountry experience they seek. It also presents safety and health threats to other re-creationists.

In 2004 the Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia listed several problems that result from ORV use in natural areas. From the Environmental News Service article:
Scalia noted that off-road vehicle use on federal land has &quot;negative environmental consequences including soil disruption and compaction, harassment of animals, and annoyance of wilderness lovers.

Several environmental organizations, including the Rangers for Responsible Recreation, are campaigning to draw attention to a growing threat posed by off-road vehicle misuse and to assist overmatched land managers in addressing ORV use impacts. These campaigns in part have prompted congressional hearings about the growing impact of unmanaged off-road vehicle use.

The House Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands held an oversight hearing on &quot;The Impacts of Unmanaged Off-Road Vehicles on Federal Land&quot; on March 13, 2008. A second hearing on off-highway vehicle (OHV) management on public lands was held by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on June 5, 2008. The Senate committee hearing was convened to find out why the agencies are failing to grapple with the negative impacts of off-road vehicle use on US public lands and what the agencies might need to start doing differently. For the first time in perhaps a decade, members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee grilled leaders of the Forest Service and the BLM about why off-road vehicle use is being allowed to damage America&#x27;s national treasures.

Taking center stage in the discussion was the &quot;travel planning process&quot;, a complex analysis and decision-making procedure to designate appropriate roads and trails. Both the Forest Service and BLM have been engaged in somewhat similar travel planning processes now for years, but some of the committee members didn&#x27;t seem to think those processes were going along so well. &quot;The BLM has identified travel management on its lands as ‘one of the greatest management challenges’ it faces,&quot; stated committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-NM. &quot;Likewise, the Forest Service has identified unmanaged recreation — including ORV use — as one of the top four threats to the management and health of the National Forest System. Despite these statements, it seems to me that neither agency has been able to successfully manage off-road use.&quot;

&quot;Existing rules for managing off-road vehicles are not being enforced,&quot; Bingaman added, and the agencies are ignoring unregulated use &quot;with significant consequences for the health of our public lands and communities, and adverse effects on other authorized public land uses.&quot;

== In gaming ==

Video games that allow users to off-road include &quot;Forza Horizon&quot;, &quot;Dirt Series, MudRunner&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, &quot;Dakar Desert Rally&quot;, and the &quot;MotorStorm&quot; series.

<text>Andrewsarchus (), meaning &quot;Andrews&#x27; ruler&quot;, is an extinct genus of artiodactyl that lived during the Middle Eocene in what is now China. The genus was first described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924 with the type species A. mongoliensis based on a largely complete cranium. A second species, A. crassum, was described in 1977 based on teeth. A mandible, formerly described as &quot;Paratriisodon&quot;, does probably belong to &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; as well. The genus has been historically placed in the families Mesonychidae or Arctocyonidae, or was considered to be a close relative of whales. It is now regarded as the sole member of its own family, Andrewsarchidae, and may have been related to entelodonts. Fossils of &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; have been recovered from the Middle Eocene Irdin Manha, Lushi, and Dongjun Formations of Inner Mongolia, each dated to the Irdinmanhan Asian land mammal age (Lutetian–Bartonian stages, 48–38 million years ago).

&quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; has historically been reputed as the largest terrestrial, carnivorous mammal given its skull length of , though its overall body size was probably overestimated due to inaccurate comparisons with mesonychids. Its incisors are arranged in a semicircle, similar to entelodonts, with the second rivalling the canine in size. The premolars are again similar to entelodonts in having a single cusp. The crowns of the molars are wrinkled, suggesting it was omnivorous or a scavenger. Unlike many modern scavengers, a reduced sagittal crest and flat mandibular fossa suggest that &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; likely had a fairly weak bite force.

== Taxonomy==

=== Early history ===

The holotype of &quot;Andrewsarchus mongoliensis&quot; is a mostly complete cranium (specimen number AMNH-VP 20135). It was recovered from the lower Irdin Manha Formation of Inner Mongolia during a 1923 palaeontological expedition conducted by the American Museum of Natural History of New York. Its discoverer was a local assistant, Kan Chuen-pao, also known as &quot;Buckshot&quot;.&quot;&quot; It was initially identified by Walter W. Granger as the skull of an &quot;Entelodon.&quot; A drawing of the skull was sent to the museum, where it was identified by William Diller Matthew as belonging to &quot;the primitive Creodonta of the family Mesonychidae&quot;. The specimen itself arrived at the museum and was described by Osborn in 1924. Its generic name honours Roy Chapman Andrews, the leader of the expedition, with the Ancient Greek &quot;archos&quot; (, &quot;ruler&quot;) added to his surname.

A second species of &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot;, &quot;A. crassum&quot;, was named by Ding Suyin and colleagues in 1977 on the basis of IVPP V5101, a pair of teeth (the second and third lower premolars) recovered from the Dongjun Formation of Guangxi.
In the 1957, Zhou Mingzhen and colleagues recovered a mandible, a fragmentary maxilla, and several isolated teeth from the Lushi Formation of Henan, China, which correlates to the Irdin Manha Formation. The maxilla belonged to a skull that was crushed beyond recognition; it is likely from the same individual as the mandible. Zhou described it in 1959 as &quot;Paratriisodon henanensis&quot;, and assigned it to Arctocyonidae. He further classified it as part of the subfamily Triisodontinae (now the family Triisodontidae) based on close similarities of the molars and premolars to those of &quot;Triisodon&quot;. A second species, &quot;P. gigas&quot;, was named by Zhou and colleagues in 1973 for a molar also from the Lushi Formation. Three molars and an incisor from the Irdin Manha Formation were later referred to &quot;P. gigas&quot;. Comparisons between the two genera were drawn as far back as 1969, when Frederick Szalay suggested that they either evolved from the same arctocyonid ancestors or that they were an example of convergent evolution. &quot;Paratriisodon&quot; was first properly synonymised with &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; by Leigh Van Valen in 1978, who did so without explanation. Regardless, their synonymy was upheld by Maureen O&#x27;Leary in 1998, based on similarities between the molars and premolars of the two genera and their comparable body sizes.

=== Classification ===

&quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; was initially regarded as a mesonychid, and &quot;Paratriisodon&quot; as an arctocyonid. In 1995, the former became the sole member of its own subfamily, Andrewsarchinae, within Mesonychia. The subfamily was elevated to family level by Philip D. Gingerich in 1998, who tentatively assigned &quot;Paratriisodon&quot; to it. In 1988, Donald Prothero and colleagues recovered &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; as the sister taxon to whales. It has since been recovered as a more basal member of Cetancodontamorpha, most closely related to entelodonts, hippos, and whales. In 2023, Yu and colleagues conducted a phylogenetic analysis of ungulates, with a particular focus on entelodontid artiodactyls. &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; was recovered as part of a clade consisting of itself, &quot;Achaenodon&quot;, &quot;Erlianhyus&quot;, &quot;Protentelodon&quot;, &quot;Wutuhyus&quot;, and Entelodontidae. It was found to be most closely related to &quot;Achaenodon&quot; and &quot;Erlianhyus&quot;, with which it formed a polytomy. A cladogram based on their phylogeny is reproduced below:

== Description ==

When first describing &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot;, Osborn believed it to be the largest terrestrial, carnivorous mammal. Based on the length of the &quot;A. mongoliensis&quot; holotype skull, and using the proportions of &quot;Mesonyx&quot;, he estimated a total body length of and a body height of . However, considering cranial and dental similarities with entelodonts, Frederick Szalay and Stephen Jay Gould proposed that it had proportions less like mesonychids and more like them, and thus that Osborn&#x27;s estimates were likely inaccurate.

=== Skull ===
The holotype skull of &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; has a total length of , and is wide at the zygomatic arches. The snout is greatly elongated, measuring one-and-a-half times the length of the basicranium, and the portion of the snout in front of the canines resembles that of entelodonts. Unlike entelodonts, however, the postorbital bar is incomplete. The sagittal crest is reduced, and the mandibular fossa is relatively flat. Together, these attributes suggest a weak temporalis muscle and a fairly weak bite force. The hard palate is long and narrow. The mandibular fossa is also offset laterally and ventrally from the basicranium, similar to the condition seen in mesonychids. The mandible itself is long and shallow, characterised by a straight and relatively shallow horizontal ramus. The masseteric fossa, the depression on the mandible to which the masseter attaches, is shallow. Symphyseal contact between the two mandibles is limited.

=== Dentition ===

The holotype cranium of &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; demonstrates the typical placental tooth formula, of three incisors, one canine, four premolars and three molars per side, though it is not clear whether the same applies to the mandible. The upper incisors are arranged in a semicircle in front of the canines, a trait that is shared with entelodonts. The second incisor is enlarged, and is almost the size of the canines. This is partly because, while the canines were originally described as being &quot;of enormous size&quot;, they are relatively small in proportion to the rest of the dentition. The upper premolars are elongate and consist of a single cusp, resembling those of entelodonts. The fourth premolar retains the protocone, though in a vestigial form. Their roots are not and lack a dentine platform, which are both likely to be adaptations to prolong the tooth&#x27;s functional life after crown abrasion. The first molar is the smallest. The second is the widest, but has been heavily worn since fossilisation. The third has largely avoided that wear. The premolars and molars have wrinkled crowns, similar to the condition seen in suids and other omnivorous artiodactyls. The tooth structure of the mandible (IVPP V5101) is difficult to determine, as nearly all are worn or broken. All of the right mandible&#x27;s teeth are preserved save for the first premolar, which is instead preserved on the left mandible. The lower canine and the first premolar both point forwards. The third molar is large, with talonids that have two cusps.

== Diet ==
In his paper describing &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot;, Osborn suggested that it may have been omnivorous based on comparisons with entelodonts. This conclusion was supported by Szalay and Gould, who use the heavily wrinkled crowns of the molars and premolars as supporting evidence, as well as the close phylogenetic relationship between &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; and entelodonts. R.M. Joeckel, in 1990, suggested that it was likely an &quot;omnivore-scavenger&quot;, and that it was an ecological analogue to entelodonts. Lars Werdelin further suggested that it was a scavenger, or that it might have preyed on brontotheres.

== Palaeoecology ==

For much of the Eocene, a hothouse climate with humid, tropical environments with consistently high precipitations prevailed. Modern mammalian orders including the Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Primates (or the suborder Euprimates) appeared already by the Early Eocene, diversifying rapidly and developing dentitions specialized for folivory. The omnivorous forms mostly either switched to folivorous diets or went extinct by the Middle Eocene (Lutetian–Bartonian, 48–38 million years ago) along with the archaic &quot;condylarths&quot;. By the Late Eocene (Priabonian, 38–34 million years ago), most of the ungulate form dentitions shifted from bunodont cusps to cutting ridges (i.e. lophs) for folivorous diets.

The Irdin Manha Formation, from which the holotype of &quot;Andrewsarchus&quot; was recovered, consists of Irdinmanhan strata dated to the Middle Eocene. &quot;Andrewsarchus mongoliensis&quot; comes from the IM-1 locality, dated to the lower Irdinmanhan, from which the hyaenodontine &quot;Propterodon&quot;, the mesonychid &quot;Harpagolestes&quot;, at least three unnamed mesonychids, the artiodactyl &quot;Erlianhyus&quot;, the perissodactyls &quot;Deperetella&quot; and &quot;Lophialetes&quot;, the omomyid &quot;Tarkops&quot;, the glirian &quot;Gomphos&quot;, the rodent &quot;Tamquammys,&quot; and various indeterminate glirians are also known. The Lushi Formation, from which the &quot;Paratriisodon henanensis&quot; specimen was recovered, was deposited at around the same time as the Irdin Manha Formation. The mesonychid &quot;Mesonyx&quot;, the pantodont &quot;Eudinoceras&quot;, the dichobunid &quot;Dichobune&quot;, the helohyid &quot;Gobiohyus&quot;, the brontotheres &quot;Rhinotitan&quot; and &quot;Microtitan&quot;, the perissodactyls &quot;Amynodon&quot; and &quot;Lophialetes&quot;, the ctenodactylid &quot;Tsinlingomys&quot;, and the lagomorph &quot;Lushilagus&quot; have been identified from the Lushi Formation. The Dongjun Formation, from which &quot;A. crassum&quot; originates, is similarly Middle Eocene. It preserves the nimravid &quot;Eusmilus&quot;, the anthracotheriid &quot;Probrachyodus&quot;, the pantodont &quot;Eudinoceras&quot;, the brontotheres &quot;Metatelmatherium&quot; and cf. &quot;Protitan&quot;, the deperetellids &quot;Deperetella&quot; and &quot;Teleolophus&quot;, the hyracodontid &quot;Forstercooperia&quot;, the rhinocerotids &quot;Ilianodon&quot; and &quot;Prohyracodon&quot;, and the amynodonts &quot;Amynodon&quot;, &quot;Gigantamynodon&quot;, and &quot;Paramnyodon&quot;.

<text>Jeanne Aubert (born Jeanne Perrinot, 21 February 1900 – 6 March 1988) was a French singer and actress.

==Biography==
Aubert was born in Paris, France, to a single mother, Augustine Marguerite Perrinot, who pushed her daughter into a career in show business. Preceding her birth, four generations of Auberts had made artificial flowers. She herself worked in an artificial flower factory, but the influence of war changed the direction of her life. At age five, she began performing on stage at the Théâtre du Châtelet. As a teenager, she was given voice and music lessons and at age eighteen appeared in an elaborate Mistinguett production at the Casino de Paris. She sang in the chorus at the Apollo theater in Paris and had bit parts in revues at the Théâtre Édouard VII. She gained prominence when, as an understudy, she replaced the lead actress in &quot;Pennsylvania, Le Bon Juge&quot;. After that, she was signed for a featured role in a production in London and went on to perform in Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland. She came to the United States to perform in &quot;Gay Paree&quot;, where she sang songs in English at the Winter Garden Theater in New York&quot;.&quot;

Using the stage name Jane Aubert, in 1929, she made her motion picture debut in the silent film, &quot;La Possession&quot;. Her film was seen by Nelson Swift Morris, son of Edward Morris of Chicago, Illinois a multi-millionaire whose family had made their fortune in meatpacking and who at the time was overseeing a meat processing operation in France. Morris used his connections to get to meet her and the two became involved. Eventually they moved to the United States and married but the marriage did not last. Morris opposed Aubert&#x27;s acting so much that &quot;He got out warrants forbidding her to appear in one show after another in Europe.&quot; In May 1937, Nelson Morris survived the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster. 
This is referenced in &quot;&quot;. Nelson Morris talks to others in a story and says, &quot;The moral of this story is, never marry an actress.&quot;

In 1931, Aubert was a guest star on a radio broadcast on WJZ, singing selections from the show &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; in which she appeared on Broadway. Her other Broadway credits included &quot;Princess Charming&quot; (1930), &quot;The Laugh Parade&quot; (1931), &quot;Ballyhoo of 1932&quot; (1932), and &quot;Melody&quot; (1933).

Following her divorce, Aubert began working in Broadway musical comedies as well as making an appearance in the 1934 East Coast film production &quot;The Gem of the Ocean&quot;. In 1935, she returned to her native France where she acted in several films during the ensuing two years. In 1937, she returned to the stage, performing in musical varieties with the celebrated songstress Fréhel in Paris. She was part of a number of other shows in London and other cities throughout Europe including the original London production of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; by Cole Porter, in which she played the lead role of Reno Sweeney. Although never a headline star, for the next three decades her career was busy with numerous recordings, film and stage performances, and eventually roles on television.

==Death==
Aubert died on 6 March 1988, aged 88, in a retirement home in Coubert, Seine-et-Marne, France, and was interred in the Cimetière parisien de Pantin in Pantin.

<doc id="1039403" wikidata="Q177085" url="?curid=1039403" title="Must weight">
<text>Must weight is a measure of the amount of sugar in grape juice (must) and, hence, indicates the amount of alcohol that could be produced if it is all fermented to alcohol, rather than left as residual sugar.

==Measurement is in degrees==
In France and many other countries, the grape must density is often recalculated to show potential alcohol, the percent alcohol content that would be the result if the must were fermented to a completely dry wine.

===Refractometer scales===
* Brix (°Bx): Used in Italy, France, and Canada.
* (KMW): Used in Austria. The scale is divided into Klosterneuburger Zuckergrade (°KMW). However, the KMW measures the exact sugar content of the must.
* Normalizovaný moštoměr (°NM): Used in the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.

===Hydrometer scales===
* Baumé scale (Bé°): Occasionally used in France and by U.S. brewers.
* Oechsle scale (°Oe): Used in Germany, Luxemburg and Switzerland. It is an important part of the German wine classification.
* Relative density: Used in the United States (although Brix is sometimes used).

==Measuring must weight==
Must weights are commonly measured in the vineyard to monitor the ripeness of the grapes, which helps select the time of harvest. For this purpose, it is usually measured by using a refractometer. A few grapes are crushed between the fingers and the must is dripped onto the glass of the refractometer. The refractometer will be calibrated in a must weight scale, but as refractometers actually measure refractive index (of the grape must in this case), the must weight scale on the refractometer is in effect an indirect measurement, with refractive indices having been pre-converted to their must weight equivalents.

<doc id="1039406" wikidata="Q2271120" url="?curid=1039406" title="Arranmore">
<text>Árainn Mhór (English name: Arranmore) is an island off the west coast of County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. Arranmore is the largest inhabited island of County Donegal, with a population of 478 in 2022, but has had a gradually falling native population since the 1990s. Its main settlement is Leabgarrow. The island is part of the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;, with most of the inhabitants speaking Ulster Irish.

It is also known in English as Aran Island (not to be confused with the Aran Islands off Galway Bay or the Scottish Isle of Arran). In Irish it was traditionally called &quot;Árainn&quot;; the adjective &quot;mór&quot; (large) was added fairly recently. It was also sometimes called &quot;Árainn Uí Dhomhnaill&quot;, &#x27;Aran of the O&#x27;Donnells&#x27;.

== Appeal to foreigners ==
In 2019, islanders wrote open letters to the United States and Australia, asking people to consider moving to the island. They encouraged both populations to come to the less crowded island and enjoy &quot;time for living&quot;. In 2022, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the island became a refuge for Ukrainian refugees who were resettled in Ireland.

==Irish language==

There are 469 people living on Arranmore and 62% are native Irish speakers. During the summer, students of all ages from all over Ireland travel to the island for a 3-week holiday. It is a very popular way of meeting new people and also learning the Irish language. Students attend school during the day and play games and ceilí dance in the evenings. They are taught about the Irish language through Irish. Irish must be spoken at all times. The college on Arranmore is known as &quot;Coláiste Árainn Mhóir&quot;, meaning the College of Arranmore.

==Location==
The island lies off Burtonport, a small coastal village in The Rosses. The island is served by two ferry services, which operate between Arranmore and Burtonport on the mainland. The two operators make use of vessels previously built for the Scottish ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac), allowing both to carry passengers, cars, and heavy-goods vehicles.

==Habitation==

Most of the population lives along the southern and (comparatively sheltered) eastern coast, where the main village, Leabgarrow (Irish: &quot;Leadhb Gharbh&quot;), is located. The island has been settled since pre-Celtic times, and the few remaining signs of early settlement include a promontory fort to the south of the island and shell middens dotted along the beaches. Its position near the Atlantic shipping lanes was exploited, with a coast guard station and a lighthouse positioned on the most north-westerly point, and a World War II monitoring post.

The permanent population is 478, but this rises to well over 1,000 during the summer. A large proportion of the housing stock is holiday homes, with both native islanders and their descendants, as well as nonlocals. Due to the long decline in population, in 2019, the local government began trying to entice Americans and Australians to move to the island.

==Infrastructure and economy==

The island was the first offshore island in Ireland to get electricity from the Rural Electrification Scheme, run by the E.S.B., in 1957, but was amongst the last places in the country to get universally reliable piped water (in 1973–75) and an automatic phone exchange (in 1986). It went directly from a manual switchboard to an ISDN-enabled system, which had to be upgraded within weeks due to massive demand for consumer phone lines, as the previous exchange had been limited to issuing numbers to business ventures only, and only had 47 internal lines.

It relies mostly on tourism for its income (fishing was the island&#x27;s mainstay up to the 1980s but is no longer a significant industry), as well as the traditional Gaeltacht summer schools. In recent years, a local development co-op has encouraged the development of other industries on the island, such as a call centre and teacher training for Irish teachers. The island&#x27;s many lakes provide rod fishing opportunities.
A co-working facility was opened in 2019 in partnership with 3 Ireland, providing high-speed internet access which the island did not previously have. 3 have produced a major marketing campaign &quot;The Island&quot; based on this.

The island has a purpose-built An Post post office. Despite the population falling below the 500 level which An Post&#x27;s 2018 review required, all island post offices have been retained.

===Emergency Services===
The island has had a based fire engine since the 1980s. A new fire station was built and supplied with a purpose-built fire engine designed for smaller roads in 2005, but has since been deemed sub-standard with a modern station required.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station on the island is equipped with the largest class of vessel the service has, a Severn class lifeboat. There has been an RNLI presence on the island since 1883, with the station having moved from Aphort to Leabgarrow and most recently to a purpose-built station at Poolawaddy in 1997. The crews of the station have been involved in some major rescues over the years, including that of the SS Stolwijk, for which the crew received medals from both the RNLI and the Dutch state. A monument to this rescue was unveiled in 2017.

A helipad was constructed in Aphort in the early 2000s which can land a Sikorsky S-92 aircraft as used by the Irish Coast Guard.

A HSE and previously North Western Health Board ambulance has been based at Arranmore Health Centre for a similar length of time; but has frequently been inoperable. Second-hand vehicles were cascaded to the Health Centre in 2009 and again in 2015 to restore service. Patients are transferred to either the RNLI Lifeboat or Irish Coast Guard helicopter at Leabgarrow or Aphort as required; or can be brought by ferry in non-urgent cases.

===Arranmore transmitter===
The Arranmore Island transmitter is a relay Saorview site used by 2RN and Highland Radio to provide coverage to the island and much of The Rosses which are shielded by mountains from the main transmissions. Two towers exist, the smaller of which belongs to Highland Radio, and the significantly larger to 2RN. The EIRP of the Saorview multiplexes are, at 4 kW, amongst the highest of any relay station. The site is above sea level, with the 2RN antenna standing at . FM radio services are also carried.

Three Ireland and Vodafone Ireland have LTE equipment on the 2RN mast, with Eir (telecommunications) having 3G equipment.

==Twinning==
The island is twinned with Beaver Island, an island in northern Lake Michigan where a large number of former residents gathered after being evicted from Arranmore in the mid-1800s. There are still today a number of families on Beaver Island that trace their roots to Arranmore. A monument to the twinning has been placed in the island&#x27;s main reservoir.

==Cultural references==

The Donegal band Goats Don&#x27;t Shave released a track entitled Arranmore on their 1994 album &quot;Out In The Open&quot;, which references the island&#x27;s history of emigration and the North West Donegal &quot;Tunnel Tigers&quot;, many of which came from Arranmore

<doc id="1039408" wikidata="Q849441" url="?curid=1039408" title="Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands">
<text>Saint John (; ) is one of the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea and a constituent district of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an unincorporated territory of the United States.

Saint John () is the smallest of the three main US Virgin Islands. It is located about four miles east of Saint Thomas, the location of the territory&#x27;s capital, Charlotte Amalie. It is also four miles southwest of Tortola, part of the British Virgin Islands. Its largest settlement is Cruz Bay with a population of 2,652. Saint John&#x27;s nickname is Love City.

Since 1956, approximately 60% of the island is protected as Virgin Islands National Park, administered by the United States National Park Service. The economy is based predominantly on tourism and related trade.

Saint John is in area with a population of 3,881 (2020 census). As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population of the US Virgin Islands territory was 87,146, comprising mostly persons of Afro-Caribbean descent.

==History==
Petroglyphs and artifacts found at Cinnamon Bay indicate a Taíno presence on Saint John from about 700 to the late 15th century.

Christopher Columbus sailed past Saint John on his second voyage in 1493, but did not come ashore. He named the northern Virgin Islands &quot;Las Once Mil Virgenes&quot;.

===Colonization and settlement===
The Danish West India Company resettled Saint Thomas in 1671, and an African slave market was established in 1673. Saint John was claimed as a part of the British Leeward Islands in 1684 when it was leased to two English merchants from Barbados, yet they were removed by Governor Stapleton. It was uninhabited when 20 Danish planters came over from Saint Thomas in 1717, and the island was claimed again by Denmark in 1718. They grew sugar cane, cotton, and other crops. Annaberg sugar plantation was built in 1731, and became one of the island&#x27;s largest sugar producers by the 19th century. By 1733, there were 109 plantations on the island, 21 of which were producing sugar. The islands were made a crown colony in 1754, and the British relinquished their claims to the island to the Danish in 1762.

The 1733 slave insurrection on St. John started when a small group of slaves entered Fort Frederiksvaern, on Fortsberg Hill in Coral Bay, with cane bills concealed within bundles of wood. The slaves, led by those formerly from Akwamu, overpowered and killed 5 of the 6 soldiers within the Danish fort. Firing the fort&#x27;s cannon, the signal was given for the start of a six-month revolt, which only ended when French troops were brought in from Martinique.

Instead of submitting to captivity and slavery, more than a dozen men and women, including Breffu, one of the leaders, shot and killed themselves before the French forces reached them.

Moravian Brethren built the first church at Emmaus in 1749. Cruz Bay was established in 1766, and includes The Battery.

By 1804, the slave population reached a peak of 2,604. Denmark emancipated the slaves in 1848, and by 1850, many of the plantations were abandoned. By 1901, Saint John&#x27;s population was 925, and the last sugar factory ceased operation in 1908. Between 1845 and 1945, the population declined by 70%.

===Purchase===
In 1917, during the First World War, the United States purchased the U.S. Virgin Islands for $25 million from the Danish government in order to establish a naval base. It was intended to prevent expansion of the German Empire into the Western Hemisphere. As part of the negotiations for this deal, the US agreed to recognize Denmark&#x27;s claim to Greenland, which they had previously disputed.

During the 20th century, private investors acquired properties on the island, redeveloping some plantation houses as vacation resorts, such as Laurence Rockefeller&#x27;s Caneel Bay Resort. The islands became popular and tourism and related service jobs developed as a major part of the economy.

===Hurricane Irma===
In September 2017, Saint John was hit by Hurricane Irma. The category 5 storm forced roughly half of the island&#x27;s 4,500 residents to evacuate and caused power outages that lasted for months.

==Government==

Since 1917, the U.S. Virgin Islands are an organized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Its residents are U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote in presidential elections.

Until 1970, governors of the territory were appointed by the US president. Since that year, residents of the island have elected a territorial governor and lieutenant governor, and fifteen senators to the legislature, representing all three islands. Seven are elected from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large (who must be a resident of Saint John) are elected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature.

Residents of the Virgin Islands also elect a delegate to the US Congress, who has non-voting status in that body.

Saint John has no local government; however, the Governor appoints an administrator for the island. Having no official powers, this figure acts more as an advisor to the Governor and as a spokesperson for the Governor&#x27;s policies.

The main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the Independent Citizens Movement (ICM), and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Additional candidates run as independents.

===Voting===

Saint John is divided into the following subdistricts (with population as per the 2020 U.S. Census):
# Central (pop. 470)
# Coral Bay (pop. 724)
# Cruz Bay (pop. 2,652)
# East End (pop. 35)

Activists filed a lawsuit on September 20, 2011 in the federal US District Court of the Virgin Islands seeking the right to be represented in Congress and to vote for U.S. president. The case is Civil No. 3:11-cv-110, &quot;Charles v. U.S. Federal Elections Commission et al.&quot; The case alleges the 1917 Congress, with all-white members, denied the right to vote to island residents due to racial discrimination, as the island had a majority of people of color. The case was dismissed on August 20, 2012.

==Economy==

The main export of Saint John used to be sugar cane, which was produced in great quantity using African slave labor. However, this industry declined after the abolition of slavery, as it was dependent on slave labor to be profitable. In addition, in that period, it had to compete with sugar produced in other areas, including by the use of sugar beets in northern locations.

=== Tourism ===
The economy of Saint John is almost entirely dependent on tourism. The island has hundreds of rental villas as well as hotels and resorts. Numerous shops and restaurants serving both residents and tourists are located in Cruz Bay and Coral Bay.

Saint John is a popular stop for day and term boat charters from the United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the British Virgin Islands. Individual and group boat charters are widely available on Saint John and island hopping is a favorite local and visitor activity. Popular day excursions include bar hopping or snorkeling at Christmas Cove, Jost Van Dyke, Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge, Tortola, Norman Island, Virgin Gorda, Water Island, Lovongo Cay, Cooper Island, and Peter Island. Mooring and anchoring locations are available in most bays around Saint John for both day use and overnight stays.

==== Virgin Islands National Park ====
In 1956, Laurance Rockefeller donated his extensive lands on the island to the United States&#x27; National Park Service, under the condition that the lands had to be protected from future development. The remaining portion, the Caneel Bay Resort, operates on a lease arrangement with the NPS, which owns the underlying land.

The boundaries of the Virgin Islands National Park include 75% of the island, but various in-holdings within the park boundary (e.g., Peter Bay) reduce the park lands to 60% of the island acreage.

Much of the island&#x27;s waters, coral reefs, and shoreline have been protected by being included in the national park. This protection was expanded in 2001, when the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument was created.

===Transport===
While Saint John does not have an airport, the island is served by Cyril E. King Airport on nearby Saint Thomas. There used to be a seaplane base in the town of Cruz Bay. Antilles Airboats provided regular service until it was sold by Maureen O&#x27;Hara. The Virgin Islands Seaplane Shuttle also used to offer services to that seaplane base using Grumman Mallard air boats prior to Hurricane Hugo.

A ferry service runs hourly from Red Hook, Saint Thomas, thrice daily from Charlotte Amalie, Saint Thomas, and daily from Tortola; regular ferries also operate from Virgin Gorda, Jost Van Dyke and Anegada.

Cars and cargo are transported to the island via barge. Two companies offer barge service between Red Hook, Saint Thomas and Cruz Bay, Saint John. The barges operate hourly during daylight hours. Although prohibited by Virgin Islands law, some rental car companies allow their vehicles to use the car ferry. This is because the U.S. District Court deemed the law to violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. However, as of 2017, the unconstitutional law is still technically on the books, but the Government of the Virgin Islands does not enforce it. Car rental companies are located throughout Cruz Bay, most within easy walking distance of the ferry dock.

Taxis are widely available on Saint John to provide transport to beaches, hotels, and vacation villas. Water taxi service is also available from Dolphin Water Taxi.

VITRAN public bus service runs hourly on weekdays between Cruz Bay and Salt Pond Bay via Centerline Road.

====Major port town====

In the colonial era, Coral Bay was the hub of economic activity on the island. Its natural port offered protection to the sailing ships of the day. In addition, it was an easy sail by smaller boats, with minimal tacking, to the nearby British Virgin Islands. Until the late 20th century, the residents of Coral Bay and East End had easier and more frequent access to Tortola than did those of either Cruz Bay or Saint Thomas.

Today, Cruz Bay is the port of entry to Saint John. Cargo and car barges use The Theovald Eric Moorehead Dock and Terminal. Domestic ferries use the Loredon L Boynes Dock in central Cruz Bay. International ferries use the United States Customs and Immigration dock at the Victor William Sewer Marine Facility.

Cruise ships visit Cruz Bay regularly during the winter, although they must anchor and deliver guests via tender. Saint John is also a popular day excursion for cruise ship passengers at port in Saint Thomas or Tortola.

The waters surrounding the US Virgin Islands are patrolled by United States Coast Guard cutters out of Miami, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.

== Notable people ==
* Breffu, an Akwamu leader of the 1733 slave insurrection on St. John
* Myrah Keating Smith (1908–1994), a pioneering nurse and midwife
* John Campbell (born 1962), and daughter Jasmine Campbell (born 1991), alpine skiers, moved to US in 2000
* J. Robert Oppenheimer, the &#x27;Godfather of the Atomic Bomb&#x27;, starting in 1954, Oppenheimer lived for several months of each year on the island. From 1957 onwards, he owned a home on Gibney Beach.

==Education==
St. Thomas-St. John School District operates schools for the island residents.
Saint John has one public school, Julius E. Sprauve (pronounced &quot;Sprow&quot; and referred to as &#x27;JESS&#x27;). Private and parochial schools include Gifft Hill School (formerly Pine Peace and Coral Bay), Saint John Christian Academy, Saint John Methodist School, and the Saint John Montessori School.

The only school that includes a high school is Gifft Hill, along with their programs in elementary and middle school. The only other middle school on the island is the &#x27;JESS,&#x27; which also has an elementary program. The public high school for Saint John students is Ivanna Eudora Kean High School located in Red Hook, Saint Thomas.

In October, 2020, the Trump administration signed a non-binding preliminary agreement to pursue a land swap between the National Park Service and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and Government of the Virgin Islands (GVI) agreed to work together for 12 months to evaluate a proposed exchange that, if successful, would allow local officials to construct the first K-12 public school on Saint John. Public education on Saint John is currently only available through the eighth grade. The National Park Service issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) on the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the potential land exchange. The final 45-day public comment period on the land exchange was opened from January 8, 2023 until Feb. 21, 2023.

<doc id="1039409" wikidata="Q13139776" url="?curid=1039409" title="Majhi dialect">
<text>Majhi (Shahmukhi: ; Gurmukhi: ; ), also known as Central Punjabi, is the most widely-spoken dialect of the Punjabi language, natively spoken in the Majha region of Punjab in present-day Pakistan and India. The dialect forms the basis of Standard Punjabi.

The native speakers of the dialect are known by the demonym &#x27;Majhail&#x27;.

==Subdialects and geographic distribution==
There are various subdialects of Majhi spoken across Majha. Although each city or district speaks slightly differently from the next, there are a few major categories of Majhi subdialects.
* Central Majhi, spoken in Kasur, Lahore, Nankana Sahib and Sheikhupura districts and nearby areas
* Eastern Majhi, spoken in Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts as well as surrounding areas
* Northern Majhi, spoken in Gujranwala, Sialkot and Wazirabad districts as well as surrounding areas
* Northeastern Majhi, spoken in Narowal, Pathankot and Gurdaspur districts
* Northwestern Majhi, spoken in Gujrat, Jhelum and Bhimber (Azad Kashmir) districts

==Notable features==

===Pronominal suffixes===
One of Majhi&#x27;s most noteworthy features is the usage of pronominal suffixes, which it shares with Western Punjabi.

Pronominal suffixes are auxiliary replacements of the copula which act like pronouns. They function as a particular thematic role and agree to it in person and number (as a pronoun would).

The thematic/syntactic roles a pronominal suffix can function as are:
* the direct case subject
* the ergative agent
* the possessive determiner
* the addressee

Majhi uses pronominal suffixes for the second and third persons and, similar to Western Punjabi, for both present and past tense.

Examples in perfect transitive verbs (marking the ergative agent):
- Alternate auxiliary verbs

First person singular &quot;ā̃&quot; or &quot;jē&quot; (ਆਂ, ਜੇ / ) is used. E.g. &quot;mẽ karnā ʷā̃ / jē&quot; (ਮੈਂ ਕਰਨਾ ਆਂ, ਮੈਂ ਕਰਨਾ ਜੇ / )

Third person singular &quot;ī&quot; or &quot;è&quot; (ਏ, ਵੇ, ਈ / ) is used. E.g. &quot;ṓ kardā&quot; ī (ਉਹ ਕਰਦਾ ਈ / )

===Copula===
The Majhi copula does not differ from Standard Punjabi, except for in the third-person plural, where instead of &quot;han&quot; (ਹਨ / ), it uses &quot;ne&quot; (ਨੇ / ) or &quot;nẽ&quot; (ਨੇਂ / ).

===Other Features===

Nasalisation of &quot;tusī̃&quot; (ਤੁਸੀਂ / ) and &quot;asī̃&quot; (ਅਸੀਂ / ) are often not realised in Majhi, thus said as &quot;tusī&quot; (ਤੁਸੀ / ) and &quot;asī&quot; (ਅਸੀ / ) respectively.

In colloquial Majhi, the &quot;s&quot; sound in many words shifts to an &quot;h&quot;, such as in &quot;asī&quot; (ਅਸੀ / ), &quot;sāḍā&quot; (ਸਾਡਾ / ) and &quot;pēse&quot; (ਪੈਸੇ / ), being heard as &quot;ahī&quot;, &quot;hāḍā&quot; and &quot;pēhe&quot; respectively.

&quot;hē(gā) sī&quot; is used instead of &quot;sīgā&quot;.

- Adverbial pronounsMajhi uses its own class of adverbial pronouns which, at their base, are common with Western Punjabi dialects; in contrast to the individually distinct class used by Eastern Punjabi dialects.

- Use of -na verb ending instead of -da ending for first-person and second-person point of view
===Examples of Majhi===
==Subdialectal differences==

===Eastern Majhi===
Eastern Majhi refers to the subdialect native to region of Majha east of Lahore, i.e. the Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts and surrounding areas. It is also spoken by the descendants of those who migrated out of these areas.

The subdialect has considerable Doabi influence, and often uses the past-tense inflection of the verb &quot;ḍahiṇā&quot; (ਡਹਿਣਾ / ) to form continuous tenses, rather than &quot;pēṇā&quot; (ਪੈਣਾ/ ) which is used by most other Majhi subdialects and Punjabi dialects.
===Northwestern Majhi===
Northwestern Majhi refers to the subdialect spoken in the northwestern side of the Majha region in Pakistan, primarily in the districts of Gujrat, Jhelum, and Bhimber.

In these areas, word-initial &#x27;h&#x27; is fainter and more tonal, eventually disappearing in upper Punjabi dialects like Pahari-Pothwari and Hazarewal Hindko, as well as Dogri. Words like &quot;hatth&quot; (ਹੱਥ / ) &quot;hand&quot; are said more as &quot;àtth&quot;.

Another notable difference is the use of the suffix &quot;-dā&quot; instead of &quot;-gā&quot; for indicative future tense.

<text>A rosé () is a type of wine that incorporates some of the color from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale &quot;onionskin&quot; orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the grape varieties used and winemaking techniques. Usually, the wine is labelled &quot;rosé&quot; in French, Portuguese, and English-speaking countries, rosado in Spanish, or rosato in Italian.

There are three major ways to produce rosé wine: skin contact, &quot;saignée&quot;, and blending. Rosé wines can be made still, semi-sparkling or sparkling and with a wide range of sweetness levels from highly dry Provençal rosé to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes and can be found all around the globe.

When rosé wine is the primary product, it is produced with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the skins are allowed to remain in contact with the juice for a short period, typically two to twenty hours. The grape must is then pressed and the skins discarded, rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer the skins are left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine.

When a winemaker desires to impart more tannin and color to red wine, some of the pink juice from the must can be removed at an early stage in what is known as the &quot;Saignée&quot; (from French bleeding) method. The red wine remaining in the vats is intensified as a result of the bleeding, because the volume of juice in the must is reduced, and the must involved in the maceration becomes more concentrated. The pink juice that is removed can be fermented separately to produce rosé.

The simple mixing of red wine into white wine to impart color is uncommon and is discouraged in most wine growing regions, especially in France, where it is forbidden by law, except for Champagne. Even in Champagne, several high-end producers do not use this method but rather opt for the saignée method.

== History ==

It is not known when the first wine labeled as a rosé was produced, but it is very likely that many of the earliest red wines made were closer in appearance to today&#x27;s rosés than they would be to modern red wines. This is because many of the winemaking techniques used to make today&#x27;s darker, more tannic red wines (such as extended maceration and harder pressing) were not widely practised in ancient winemaking. Both red and white wine grapes were often pressed soon after harvest, (with very little maceration time) by hand, feet or even sack cloth, creating juice that was only lightly pigmented.

Even after the development of newer, more efficient wine presses, many ancient and early winemakers still preferred making the lighter colored and fruitier style of wines. There was an understanding, as early as the time of the Ancient Greeks and Roman winemakers, that harder pressing and letting the juice &quot;sit&quot; for a period with the skins would make darker, heartier wines, but the resulting wines were often considered too harsh and less desirable. This sentiment lasted well into the Middle Ages, when the pale clarets from Bordeaux were starting to gain the world&#x27;s attention. To the powerful English market, the most prized clarets were, according to wine historian Hugh Johnson, the &quot;vin d&#x27;une nuit&quot; or &quot;wine of one night&quot;, which were pale-rosé colored wines made from juice that was allowed only a single night of skin contact. The darker wine produced from must that had longer skin contact were known as the &quot;vin vermeilh&quot; (or &quot;pinpin&quot; to the English) was considered to be of much lesser quality.

Similarly, in the early history of Champagne, the wines produced from this region during the Middle Ages were nothing like the sparkling white wines associated with the region today. Instead they were pale red and even pinkish, with some Champenois winemakers using elderberries to add more red color to the wines as they competed with the wines of Burgundy for the lucrative Flemish wine trade. In the 16th and 17th century, the region achieved some acclaim for their &quot;white&quot; wines made from Pinot noir grapes, but rather than actually being white, these wines were instead a pale &quot;greyish pink&quot; that was reminiscent of a &quot;partridge&#x27;s eye&quot; and earned the nickname &quot;Œil de Perdrix&quot;—a style of rosé still being produced in Switzerland. In the late 17th century, the Champenois (aided by the work of Dom Perignon) learned how to better separate the skins from the must and produce truly white wine from red wine grapes.

Even as Champenois moved towards producing sparkling wines, they continued to produce both sparkling and still rosés often by means of blending a small amount of red wine to &quot;color up&quot; an already-made white wine. The depth of color was dependent on the amount red wine added, with the red wine having more influence on the resulting flavor of the wine if added in larger volumes.

===After World War II===

The history of rosé would take a dramatic turn following the conclusion of World War II when two Portuguese wine producer families both released sweet, slightly sparkling rosés to the European and American markets. These wines, Mateus and Lancers, would go on to set record sales in Europe and the US and dominate the Portuguese wine industry for most of the 20th century, but their popularity has declined in the recent years of the 21st century. While they still have a presence in the European and US markets, the trend towards traditional, drier rosés, as well as the development of American &quot;blush&quot; wines like White Zinfandel, have cut into their market shares.

In the early 1970s, demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes, so many California producers made &quot;white&quot; wine from red grapes, in a form of saignée production with minimal skin contact, the &quot;whiter&quot; the better. In 1975, Sutter Home&#x27;s &quot;White Zinfandel&quot; wine experienced a stuck fermentation, a problem in which the yeast goes dormant, or in some cases dies off before all the sugar is turned to alcohol. Winemaker Bob Trinchero put it aside for two weeks, then upon tasting it he decided to sell this pinker, sweeter wine.

In 1976, wine writer Jerry D. Mead visited Mill Creek Vineyards in Sonoma County, California. Charles Kreck had been one of the first to plant Cabernet Sauvignon vines in California, and offered Mead a wine made from Cabernet that was a pale pink and not yet named. Kreck would not call it &quot;White Cabernet&quot; as it was much darker in color than red grape &quot;white&quot; wines of the time, though not as dark as the rosés he had known. Mead jokingly suggested the name &quot;Cabernet Blush&quot;; later that evening, he phoned Kreck to say that he no longer thought the name to be a joke. In 1978 Kreck trademarked the word &quot;Blush&quot;. The name caught on as a marketing name for the semi-sweet wines from producers such as Sutter Home and Beringer. Today, Blush wine appears on wine lists more often as a category, rather than a specific wine. In 2010 Mill Creek produced a rosé wine for the first time in years, although Jeremy Kreck (Charles&#x27; grandson and current winemaker) chose not to use the Blush name.

Although &quot;blush&quot; originally referred to a color (pale pink), it now tends to indicate a relatively sweet pink wine, typically with 2.5% residual sugar; in North America, dry pink wines are usually marketed as rosé but sometimes as blush. In Europe, almost all pink wines are referred to as rosé regardless of sugar levels, even semi-sweet ones from California. As the term &quot;rosé&quot; regained popularity in the US market, shares of wine labeled &quot;blush&quot; declined from 22% of all wines consumed in the US in 1997 to 15% in 2003.

In the United States, a record 2005 California crop has resulted in an increased production and proliferation of varietals used for rosés, as winemakers chose to make rosé rather than leave their reds unsold.

Rosé became a viral drink in 2015, with men who drink rosé being referred to as brosé. In summer 2016, a slushy variation, frosé, was developed at the Bar Primi in New York.

== Winemaking methods ==

Rosés can be produced in a variety of ways with the most common method being early pressing of red grape varieties after a very short period, usually 12–24 hours, of skin-contact (maceration). During maceration, phenolics such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these phenolics also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have maceration last several days to even several weeks, the very limited maceration of rosés means that these wines will have less stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter shelf-life that are meant to be consumed soon after release.
=== Saignée ===
The saignée (; French for &quot;bleed&quot;) method is the practice of removing (&quot;bleeding off&quot;) some of the juice from the must in order to more deeply concentrate the phenolics, color, and flavor of the red wine. It has a long history of use in the French wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy but wasn&#x27;t always used for rosé production. For some red winemakers, the juice bleed off is simply poured down the drain or used as &quot;topping wine&quot; to fill the &quot;ullage&quot; (the headspace of barrels and tanks) during storage. Its use in rosé production is sometimes considered an afterthought, as a way to increase cash-flow by producing a second wine to a primary red wine that can be released much sooner and available to market. While many wineries have been able to produce critically acclaimed rosé using the saignée method, its use has provoked criticism from wine personalities such as François Millo, president of the Provence Wine Council (CIVP) who claim that saignée method rosés are “not true rosés&quot; because the bleeding process (which is not pressed with the must) is more of an afterthought.

===Vin gris===
Unlike the maceration method which gives some, albeit very brief, time for the juice to be in contact with the skins &quot;vin gris&quot; are wines made from the immediate pressing of red skin grapes without any maceration time. Despite the name &quot;vin gris&quot;, the resulting juice is actually not grey but rather a very pale pink that is usually much lighter than traditionally made rosés using the limited maceration and saignée methods. Under French wine laws, wines labelled &quot;gris de gris&quot; must only be made from lightly tinted grape varieties such as Cinsault, Gamay and Grenache gris. The style is a specialty of the Lorraine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) Côtes de Toul made from Gamay and in Morocco where the orange-pink wine is made from a blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon.

===Decolorization===
Another method of producing rosé is to severely decolorize a red wine using absorbent charcoal such as activated carbon. This purer form of charcoal obtained by the dry distillation of carbon compounds (such as wood or peat) has a high ratio of surface area to weight that adsorbs color compounds as well as other phenolics and colloids in a wine. While it can be used to decolorize a wine, often much more than just color is stripped from the wine which makes this method very rarely used in the production of quality rosés.

== Color ==

With the exception of very few varieties, known as teinturiers, most wine grapes produce clear or colorless juice. This includes such well known red wine grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir. The color in red wine comes from phenolics in the skin called anthocyanins that react with other components in wine (such as tannins, acetaldehyde and pyruvic acid) to form polymeric pigments. The anthocyanins are extracted from the skin during the process of maceration which can last from a few hours in the case of some rosés (which usually only have 20–50 mg/L of anthocyanins) to several days in the case of most red wines (which often have in excess of 250 mg/L of anthocyanins).
Anthocyanins have the ability to change into three different forms—colorless, red and blue—depending on the pH/acidity levels of the solution they are in. At wine pH (typically 2.9-4.0), most of the grape anythocyanins are in the colorless form unless they have reacted with tannins or other molecules (such as tannins also extracted from the skin as well as grape seeds, stems and from oak wine barrels) to form a stabilized pigment. So producers wishing to make rosé work to not only limit the amount of anthocyanins extracted into the wine but also limit the wine&#x27;s exposure to tannins (either by less maceration time, gentle pressing of the grapes or using only stainless tanks instead of oak) as well as protective anti-oxidative winemaking techniques that limit the development of acetaldehyde and other browning pigments that could add color to the wine.

According to &quot;Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins de Provence&quot; in France, rosés in Provence display one of the different colors: melon (cantaloupe), peach, redcurrant, grapefruit, mango, mandarin.

Many studies have shown that the color of wine influences consumers&#x27; perceptions about the wine. While these studies have shown that consumers tend to prefer on visual inspection the darker rosés, in blind taste tests where color could not be visually discerned (such as using black wine glasses), often consumers preferred the lighter-colored rosés.

For these reasons, many rosé winemakers are mindful of the color quality of their rosé and make winemaking decisions based on this factor. This includes the extent of maceration, whether or not to do a &quot;saignee&quot; from a darker red wine and even to do a color adjustment by blending in some finished red wine in order to reach the desired color.

==Aromas and flavors==

The aromas and flavor of rosés are primarily influenced by the particular grape varieties used to produce the wine, but the method of production also plays an important part. The light, fruity character of many rosés come from volatile thiols that are found as flavor precursors in the grape skins. The most prominent of these are 3-mercaptohexanol-1-ol and 3-mercaptohenyl acetate. These are extracted from the grape skins during maceration but are less likely to be extracted at temperatures below 20 °C (68 °F). As a result, producers doing a &quot;cold soak&quot; maceration (with much lower temperature) to limit microbial and oxidative activity may extract less of these compounds. During fermentation, other flavor components such as the esters phenethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate also form and contribute to a wine&#x27;s aromas.

The stability of these aromas is very dependent on the amount of anthocyanins and other phenolics that protect these compounds from oxidation. One of the reasons why rosés have a very limited shelf-life is because of their low phenolic levels due to the very limited skin contact and extraction time. Within a year of production, the level of 3-mercaptohexanol-1-ol in the wine has usually dropped to half its fermentation level, with the presence of 3-mercaptohenyl acetate undetectable in most wines. This is why most wine experts recommend that rosés be consumed as soon after release as possible.

==French rosés==
France is the top global producer of rosé, accounting for 35% of the world&#x27;s supply. It also leads in consumption, with one-third of the wine consumed in the country being rosé. Many of the earliest red wines produced in such notable wine regions as Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne were &quot;rosé-style&quot; wines made from juice that had only brief periods of skin contact during winemaking. But even as the trend in these regions evolved towards more modern ideas of &quot;red wines&quot;, rosés still hold a prominent place in many of France&#x27;s major wine regions. Today rosé is produced throughout France from the cooler climate rosé Champagnes and Loire Valley wines to the warm Mediterranean influence climates of Provence and the southern Rhone Valley.

===Provence===

Rosés account for vast majority of Provence&#x27;s wine production, ranging from half to almost two thirds of all the wine produced in the region. Over the period between 2010 and 2024, exports of rosé from Provence have surged by about 500%. The rosés of Provence are often known for their food and wine pairing matches with the local Mediterranean cuisine of the region, particularly the garlicky aioli sauces and tangy bouillabaisse stews that are the hallmark of Provençal cuisine.

The large Cotes de Provence AOC includes 85 communes between the towns of Nice and Marseille and is responsible for nearly 75% of all Provençal wine with rosés alone accounting for 80% of that total. Grenache is the dominant grape of the region, comprising at least 60% of the blend with Syrah, Cinsault, Mourvedre, Tibouren, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon playing supporting roles.

The Coteaux d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence AOC is the second largest AOC in Provence, covering 50 communes in the west and northwestern part of the region. Here rosé accounts for around 35% of the AOC&#x27;s production with Grenache, Cinsault and Mourvedre being the dominant varieties and Counoise, Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon rounding out the blends.

Located in the hilly central region of Provence, rosés account for almost two-thirds of the production in the Coteaux Varois AOC. Here the wines are blends of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre accounting for at least 80% of the wine with Cinsault, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan permitted to fill in the remainder.

The Bandol AOC in southwest Provence is dominated by the late-ripening Mourvedre grape which produces well in the limestone, silicon rich stony soils of the region. While the AOC produces mostly red wines, at least 33% of its yearly production is made up of rosé wines with Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Carignan playing supporting roles to Mourvedre.

Around the city of Nice in southeast Provence is Bellet AOC where the hot summers is tempered by the cooling sea coast breeze off the Mediterranean. Here rosé is made in roughly equal proportions with the red wines made from Braquet, Folle Noire, Grenache and Cinsault.

===Tavel===

While most of the southern Rhône Valley is dominated by red wines, rosé is the only permitted wine style made in the Tavel AOC with more than half of the AOC production done by the local winemakers&#x27; co-operative. According to wine expert Karen MacNeil, the Tavel is &quot;southern France&#x27;s self-styled capital of rosé&quot;. This is due, in part, to its long history of rosé production and its proximity to the tourist-rich regions of southern France where, like Provençal rosé, Tavel is often served at beach-side cafes overlooking the Mediterranean.

Located 10 miles southwest of the Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC, just across the Rhône River, the AOC has more than 950 ha (2347 acres) planted. The wines of Tavel are dominated by the southern wine grape Grenache which makes up to 60% of the blend. Under AOC laws the remaining blend must be at least 15% Cinsault with the remainder of the wine permitted to include Carignan, Syrah, Bourboulenc, Calitor, Mourvedre and Picpoul.

While Tavel rosé can be made using the saignee and skin-contact method, the tradition in the region is to do a type of co-ferment with both red and white grapes that combines elements of both methods. The grapes are loaded, whole clusters, into a tank all together where under the gravity of their own weight the grapes are gently pressed and the juice trickles down to the bottom. There the juice receives its period of brief skin contact with the crushed red skins on the bottom before the lightly colored free-run juice is then drained off, like a saignee, and the wine then fermented as normal. This method produces what Karen MacNeil describes as &quot;rugged wines with robust, spicy berry flavor.&quot;

====Other Rhône rosés====
Outside of Tavel, rosés are produced in some significant quantities in the Gigondas AOC on the eastern side of the Rhône valley. Here at least 15% of the wine must be made from Syrah and Mourvedre with Grenache permitted to make up to 80% of the blend and Cinsault and Carignan playing minor roles. Next door to the south in the Vacqueyras AOC rosés only account for around 4% of the yearly production using the same grapes as Gigondas.

Across the river from Châteauneuf-du-Pape just north of Tavel is the Lirac AOC which, like it southern neighbor, has a long history of exporting dry rosé wines to the United States and United Kingdom. While often overshadowed by neighboring Tavel, some critics, such as wine expert Oz Clarke, describe them as having noticeable strawberry notes and being &quot;breezier, more refreshing&quot; than its more prominent neighbor. However, rosés usually account for less than a fifth of this region&#x27;s yearly production. Here in the sandy soil on the banks of the Rhône, Grenache makes up to 40% of the blend with Cinsault, Mourvedre, Syrah and Carignan making up the remainder.

===Loire===

Rosé making has a long history in the Loire valley, particularly in the Anjou wine region around the town of Angers where two AOCs, &quot;Rosé d&#x27;Anjou&quot; and &quot;Cabernet d&#x27;Anjou&quot; exist. The former, made from the Groslot (Grolleau) grapes that are often harvested to very high yields around 50 hl/ha, tends to be lighter and often sweet. The latter, made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, is often drier (though some styles can be sweet), with grapes that are limited to smaller harvests of no more than 40 hl/ha. Cabernet d&#x27;Anjou are usually noted for their high acidity levels that give these rosé the rather unusual capability of being able to age for a decade or more.

For most of the 20th century, the sweeter Rosé d&#x27;Anjou was the most prominent Rosé but even as the trend of consumers moving to more drier versions of rosé, the AOC still produces an estimated 18 million bottles of wine a year. In addition to Groslot, Gamay and Malbec are also permitted varieties in the wine.

A larger &quot;Rosé de Loire&quot; appellation exist that includes wines made from Anjou, Saumur and Touraine. Cabernet grapes must account for at least 30% of the blend with Groslot, Pineau d&#x27;Aunis, Pinot noir and Gamay permitted to fill out the rest of the blend. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, the wines are always dry with a quality level that falls somewhere between Rosé d&#x27;Anjou and Cabernet d&#x27;Anjou. Wine expert Karen MacNeil describes well made examples of Rosé de Loire as being fruity with light cherry flavors and moderate acidity.

===Champagne===

Rosé Champagnes account for between 3-5% of Champagne&#x27;s yearly production. These Champagnes are distinct from &quot;Blanc de noirs&quot; (white of blacks or white from black grapes) in that rosé Champagnes are often noticeably and intentionally colored, with hues that span from &quot;baby pink&quot; to copper salmon, while &quot;Blanc de noirs&quot; are white wines with only sometimes the palest of coloring that could range from a &quot;white-grey&quot; to a light salmon. This color traditionally comes from the very brief skin contact of the black grapes (Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier) during pressing that the Champagne producer decides not to remove by any decolorizing techniques. However, many modern rosé Champagnes are produced as regular Champagnes but are later &quot;colored up&quot; by adding red Pinot noir wines to the finished wine. According to wine expert Karen MacNeil, some Champagne producers believe this second method adds more richness and age-ability to the wine.

In the Aube department, a separate AOC for still rosé produced around the commune of Riceys was established for rosé produced by the &quot;saignee&quot; method from exclusively Pinot noir. Produced only during the warmest, ripest vintages of Champagne (with often less than 7500 bottles made on average), &quot;Rosé des Riceys&quot; can be difficult to find. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Rosé des Riceys can be some of France&#x27;s &quot;most serious rosés&quot; while fellow wine expert Oz Clarke describes them as &quot;oddball&quot; wines that come across as full-bodied and nutty with a golden pink color.

===Other French regions===

In Languedoc-Roussillon, the largest producer of rosé wine in France, rosés are made in many ways and from most common rosé wine grape varieties. This is due to the large use of the PGI appellation system.

In the Jura wine region, the Arbois AOC makes very pale, pink red wines that are often mistaken for rosés from Pinot noir and the local Poulsard and Trousseau varieties. But the region also makes even paler actual rosés from the same grape varieties that are pressed after only a few hours of skin contact.

In Beaujolais rosés are made from the Gamay grape using the same carbonic maceration techniques as the red wines except that the free-run juice that is released by the weight of the whole berry grapes in the tank is periodically drained off throughout the process to avoid extracting too much color and phenolics.

In Bordeaux, rosé production is permitted in most AOC using the same varieties as the region&#x27;s well known reds—Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carmenere.

==Other European rosés==

===Italy===

Like France, rosés are made throughout Italy with the style and grape varieties used changing depending on the region and local climate. The long history of Italian rosés, particularly in the warm southern part of the country, stem from difficulties in the early days of winemaking to make dark, fully colored dry red wines without temperature controlled fermentation vessels. As the must macerated with the skins, the intense heat of the process would often kill the yeast resulting in a stuck fermentation and residual sugar in the remaining wine. Eventually Italian winemakers realized that if they pressed the wines early in the process, remaining the skins, they could complete the fermentation albeit with a lightly colored wine.

The Italians have several terms for rosé style wines beginning with the term &quot;rosato&quot; that is a permitted wine style in several &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot;. These wine tend to be very pale in color with slightly dark wines (but not dark enough to be considered a &quot;rosso&quot; or red wine) being labeled as &quot;Chiaretto&quot;. &quot;Ramato&quot;, a specialty in the Veneto, are copper-colored rosés made from pink-skinned Pinot grigio grape that are allowed a period of extended maceration. The term &quot;Cerasuolo&quot; (meaning &quot;cherry red&quot;) describes a vividly colored rosé and is seen frequently in the Abruzzo region where rosé made in the Montepulciano d&#x27;Abruzzo region from deeply pigmented Montepulciano grape are given a special designation within the DOC.

Today, Italian rosés are most often made by the short maceration method though some regions do have a tradition of blending red and white wine grapes together to make a lightly colored wine. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, northeast Italy (which includes the Veneto wine, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol (wine)), tends to make &quot;delicate rosés&quot; while warmer southern Italy (which includes Calabria, Apulia and Sicily) makes fuller bodied and &quot;fairly gutsy dry rosés&quot;.
In the Valle d&#x27;Aosta DOC, locals refer to the indigenous grape Premetta as a &quot;rosato naturale&quot; due to the extremely thin and lightly pigmented skins of the variety that even with extended maceration can only produce a very pale rosé wine. According to wine experts Joe Bastianich and David Lynch, Valle d&#x27;Aosta Premetta rosés are very fruity with strawberry aromas and spicy cinnamon notes.

====Occhio di Pernice====
In Tuscany, there is a tradition of producing a sweet rosato version of Vin Santo. Usually made with white grapes, such as Trebbiano, these dessert wines are made from the red Sangiovese grape and are called &quot;Occhio di Pernice&quot; (meaning &quot;eye of the partridge&quot;. While traditionally produced in the Chianti DOC region, these wines are produced throughout Tuscany including the Carmignano DOC (the Carmignano DOCG is used for red wines only), Montecarlo DOC, Cortona DOC, Bolgheri and Elba DOCs.

===Germany, Austria, Switzerland===
In Germany, several regions are noted for their distinct style of rosé (German &quot;rosewein&quot; or &quot;roseewein&quot;). Several terms are used to denote these different styles depending on how the wine was made, from what grapes and in what region. The term &quot;Weißherbst&quot; is a type of German rosé made from a single variety of grape with that particular variety needing to be denoted on the wine label. &quot;Rotling&quot; refers to a rosé that is either made from multiple grape varieties that can either be all red wine varieties or a mixture of white and red grape varieties. This designation is required on all Tafelwein (table wine), Landwein (&quot;country wine&quot; similar to the French &quot;vin de pays&quot;) and &quot;Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete&quot; (QbA) level but its presence on the label is optional for Prädikatswein (the highest classification of German wine).

In the Baden region, &quot;Badisch Rotgold&quot; is a specialty rosé made from Spätburgunder (Pinot noir) and Ruländer (Pinot gris). Under German wine law the wine must be made to at least QbA level (meaning the grapes must be harvested with a ripeness level of at least 51°Oe to 72°Oe. A specialty of the Rems Valley in nearby Württemberg region is a style of wine known as &quot;Schillerwein&quot;. Produced in the area for over 300 years, Schillerwein is made from pressing and co-fermenting red and white grape varieties together. While not always a rosé, the color of Schillerwein range from dark red to pale pink depending on the grape varieties and percentage of each used in the blend.

In Austria, Styria is known for a particular type of rosé called &quot;Schilcher&quot; that is made from the indigenous Blauer Wildbacher grape that is rarely grown outside of western Styria. The wine is noted for it fruity flavor and high levels of acidity.

In the eastern regions of Switzerland, near the German and Austria borders, a special style of rosé known as Süssdruck is produced using only the free-run juice of Pinot noir. It is known as Oeil de perdrix from Switzerland.

===Spanish rosado===

In Spain, rosés are known as &quot;rosado&quot; and are produced throughout the country with the Navarra DO, north of Rioja being the most noted region. Even today, more than half of Navarra&#x27;s wine production is dedicated to rosados made primarily from the Garnacha (Grenache) grape. Other varieties that can be used for rosados in Navarra include Graciano, Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Carignan.

In the Alicante and Jumilla DOs the winemakers made their red wines and rosados using a method that is almost the reverse of the &quot;saignee&quot; method (where rosé juice is bled off the red wine). This method, known as the &quot;doble pasta&quot; (meaning &quot;double paste&quot;) takes the skins from the early pressed rosé wine and adds them to the red wine (similar to the Italian &quot;ripasso&quot; method). The rosados are made like normal with a light, fruity style while the red wines made with the extra skins are darker in color and more deeply concentrated.

Other Spanish wine regions noted for their rosados include the &quot;denominaciones de origen&quot; (DOs) of Utiel-Requena, Yecla, Txakoli, Cigales, Tierra de Leon and Ribera del Duero.

===Portugal===
In 1942, a winemaker from Vinho Verde, Fernando van Zeller Guedes, was inspired by the sales success that the lightly sparkling wine from his home region was having in Portugal and Brazil. He decided to try making a more fully sparkling rosé that was sweetened to appeal to the mass European and North American markets. At the end of World War II, production of Guedes&#x27; wine, Mateus, named after the Mateus Palace in the Vila Real Municipality, was in full operation with sales steadily climbing. By the 1980s, both the red and sparkling white versions of Mateus accounted for over 40% of the entire Portuguese wine industry, with worldwide sales of 3.25 million cases. However, sales of Mateus eventually started to decline, and though it still being produced, with Mateus introducing a Tempranillo sparkling rosé in 2005, it is not quite the dominating force in the market that it once was.

The history of Lancers, the other, notable Portuguese sparkling rosé that rose up after World War II, is quite similar to Mateus. The winemaking family of José Maria da Fonseca in the Setúbal DOC, one of the oldest Portuguese wine producers, received word from a distributor in New York City about American servicemen returning from Europe having a taste for many of the new wines they tried on their tours. In 1944, Fonseca released Lancers in a distinctive stone crock. Today, the wine is fully sparkling, using the &quot;continuous method&quot; of fermentation in large stainless steel tanks instead of individual wine bottles. While its rival, Mateus, is mostly still found in Europe, Lancers has remained in the North American market.

==New World rosés==

===White Zinfandels and blushes===

While there have been rosés made in the European style throughout the American winemaking history, it wasn&#x27;t until the end of the 20th century that &quot;pink wines&quot; became a truly significant segment of the American wine market. In what has been described by wine experts such as Jancis Robinson as a &quot;marketing triumph&quot;, California winemaker Bob Trinchero of Sutter Home salvaged a stuck fermentation of his 1972 red Zinfandel wine by releasing a paler, sweeter rosé colored wine that he labeled as &quot;White Zinfandel&quot;. Though he wasn&#x27;t the first Californian winemaker to make a rosé version of Zinfandel, he was the first to aggressively market it as a new wine style. Consequently, Sutter Home saw sales of &quot;White Zin&quot; soar from 25,000 cases in 1980 to more than 1.5 million in 1986. The wine became so popular that it actually saved old vine Zinfandel plantings that were in danger of being uprooted and replanted with more &quot;marketable&quot; international varieties, and even encouraged newer plantings.

The term &quot;blush&quot; also originated in the 1970s when wine writer Jerry Mead visited the Sonoma County winery Mill Creek Vineyards and sampled a pale, pinkish wine that the winery made from Cabernet Sauvignon. The winemaker was thinking of calling the wine &quot;White Cabernet&quot; but Mead suggested the term &quot;blush&quot; instead. However, by the 1980s, white wines were still extremely popular among American consumers. Seizing on this interest, makers of sweeter &quot;blush&quot; style rosés began affixing the terms &quot;white&quot; or &quot;blanc&quot; to the varietal name on their wine labels anyway—White Zinfandel, Cabernet Blanc, White Merlot, etc. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, these sweeter blush wines saw tremendous popularity among American consumers but their numbers had started to decline by the turn of the 21st century falling from representing 22% of all the wines consumed in the US market in 1997 to 15% in 2003.

Today, White Zinfandels are considered part of the &quot;blush wine&quot; category of noticeably sweet, pale pink wines that often have very slight carbonation to give the wine a balance of acidity and some &quot;liveliness&quot;. Very often winemakers will blend aromatic varieties like Riesling, Gewürztraminer and Muscat to add to the fruity nose of the wine.

===Long Island Rosés===

Since the early 1990s, Long Island has begun to distinguish itself as a source of rosé, often producing dry rosé wines that model the rosé makers from southern France. The eastern end of Long Island has over 60 vineyards and wineries that produce a range of rosé wines.

<text>Cecil B. Demented is a 2000 black comedy film written and directed by John Waters. The film stars Melanie Griffith as a snobby A-list Hollywood actress who is kidnapped by a band of terrorist filmmakers; they force her to star in their underground film. Stephen Dorff stars as the eponymous character and leader of the group, with Alicia Witt, Adrian Grenier, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Michael Shannon co-starring as the rest of his gang of filmmakers.

The film, whose title (also the name of Dorff&#x27;s character) alludes to director Cecil B. DeMille, is loosely based on the 1974 kidnapping of Patricia Hearst, who has a cameo role. Like all of Waters&#x27; films, it was shot in Baltimore, Maryland. The film was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on August 11, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment.

==Plot==
Hollywood A-list actress Honey Whitlock publicly presents herself as a sweet and considerate woman, but is actually a profane, unreasonable, and demanding diva. While in Baltimore to attend a premiere for her latest film, Honey is kidnapped by manic film director Cecil B. Demented and his band of misfit, Andy Warhol–worshiping artists who have branded themselves &quot;outlaw filmmakers&quot;, known collectively as the &quot;Sprocket Holes&quot;. Each of the Sprocket Holes has infiltrated the staff of the theater where the premiere is to take place; they subsequently kidnap Honey as she concludes her speech on stage. In the ensuing mayhem, the group escapes.

Honey is taken to an abandoned movie theater where she is kept gagged with tape on her mouth, tied up and blindfolded. Honey is introduced to Cecil&#x27;s crew of followers, each of whom wears a tattoo of a noted filmmaker and reveals unique, individual quirks. Cecil explains that he wants to make his masterpiece film and needs Honey to star as the lead. At first, she resists, shooting scenes halfheartedly, but when Cecil demands better results, Honey gives an over-the-top performance in the film&#x27;s opening scene which pleases him. Apart from the first scene, Cecil, Honey and the crew roam around the city filming scenes at real (unapproved) locations, often involving innocent bystanders in the process.

The group&#x27;s first location is a movie theater playing &quot;Patch Adams: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, which they storm with guns and smoke bombs before leaving with their footage. Several bystanders note in interviews that Honey seems younger and cooler than in her recent Hollywood films, but a spokesman for the Baltimore Film Commission &quot;says no to cinema terrorism&quot;. Inspired, Cecil decides to invade the luncheon the Commission is hosting. The group crashes the event and Cecil orders Honey to jump off the roof of a nearby building, which she does without safety measures. A gunfight ensues between Cecil&#x27;s crew and the police, during which hairdresser Rodney is killed, and Cecil is wounded. Honey uses the opportunity to turn herself in to the authorities and they take her away in a police car, but the film group retrieves her soon afterward.

As Honey seems to become more comfortable with her situation, possibly developing Stockholm syndrome, she watches a television special discussing her disappearance. People who knew her, including her ex-husband, are interviewed and come clean about how mean-spirited she was in daily life. Honey now realizes that her desire to escape would only lead her back to Hollywood, where she is hated for being rude. She resists the idea of joining Cecil&#x27;s followers but soon reconsiders and declares herself &quot;Demented forever&quot;, having her arm branded and officially joining the motley crew.

The Sprocket Holes then invade the set of the &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; sequel being filmed in Baltimore, at Honey&#x27;s suggestion. Upon arrival, they subdue and replace many of the film&#x27;s crew. A gunfight breaks out between Cecil&#x27;s cohorts and Teamsters who got free. Members of Cecil&#x27;s crew are either killed or wounded. The surviving Sprocket Holes and Honey flee to a nearby pornographic theater and seek refuge inside. The audience helps Cecil escape.

At their last location, Cecil is shooting the final scene at a local drive-in while law enforcement are alerted. Cecil and the crew invade the projection room, and he proceeds to excite the crowd into a frenzy. He asks Honey to light her hair on fire for the final shot, which she does. With the film finished, the Sprocket Holes start having sex in public before the authorities step in. Cecil sets himself completely ablaze as police arrive, to give Honey a chance to escape. In the ensuing chaos, some crew members escape with the raw film footage while others are shot. Taken into custody, Honey is surprised and pleased by the new affection that the crowd has shown to her as she is led into a police van.

==Release==
The film was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2000. It was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on August 11, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; grossed $1.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $676,898 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2 million, against an estimated budget of $10 million.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 52% based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;The idea behind John Waters&#x27; latest has much potential, but the movie ends up being too sloppy and underdeveloped in terms of script and direction. Also, by today&#x27;s standards, it fails to shock.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one and a half stars out of four, remarking that it was like &quot;a home movie [with] a bunch of kids goofing off&quot;, while Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;&quot;DeMented&quot; is Waters the way we like him—spiked with laughs and served with a twist&quot;.

In more recent years, the film has been reappraised by some critics. In a 2020 review, A. S. Hamrah of &quot;The Baffler&quot; wrote, &quot;Seen today, &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; is hilarious, cheap, and necessary. A series of low-budget set pieces, the film mocks all aspects of film production, bemoaning the loss of trash to blockbuster entertainment, exhorting young filmmakers across America to form queer families and blow things up.&quot; In a 2021 review, Will Sloan of &quot;Screen Slate&quot; wrote, &quot;As a filmmaker, Waters&#x27;s flaws and virtues are so densely intertwined as to be indistinguishable. His actors are mostly just mouthpieces for his ideas, but if you can accept a universe in which the baby-faced likes of Adrian Grenier, Alicia Witt, and Maggie Gyllenhaal can&#x27;t stop talking about Pasolini, the ideas are as stimulating as ever.&quot; In a 2022 review, Scout Tafoya of &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; may lack some of the immediacy of Waters&#x27; early experiments in transgression, but it&#x27;s one of his most personal statements.&quot;

<doc id="1039420" wikidata="Q2100974" url="?curid=1039420" title="Dovrefjell">
<text>Dovrefjell is a mountain range in Central Norway that forms a natural barrier between Eastern Norway and Trøndelag. The mountain range is located in Innlandet, Møre og Romsdal, and Trøndelag counties in Norway. As a result of its central location, its valleys and passes have been heavily trafficked during and probably preceding historical times. Several mountain inns were established in the Middle Ages to house pilgrims traveling through Dovrefjell to Trondheim, and there are even ruins of an old leper colony in the northern area of it. 
The main south-north highway (European route E6) and the Dovrebanen railway line both run through a mountain pass in the Dovrefjell range. The highway is a year-round highway but on rare occasions it is closed for short periods during heavy winter weather conditions. The mountain range runs through Oppdal Municipality in Trøndelag county, Folldal Municipality, Dovre Municipality, and Lesja Municipality in Innlandet county, and Sunndal Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county. The municipalities of Oppdal, Folldal, and Dovre, together, make up what is sometimes known as the Dovre Region.

As it is a natural habitat for many rare plants and animals, much of the Dovrefjell range has become a national park in several stages starting in 1911, when some plants were put under protection. When the railroad was built from Oslo to Trondheim in 1921, one of the marshes was preserved. In 1974, parts of the mountain range became Dovrefjell National Park and the park was extensively enlarged in 2002. Together with the neighboring Rondane National Park, the area has Norway (and Europe&#x27;s) last stock of wild reindeer of Beringian origin. Dovrefjell (west of E6 / the Dovre Line) also has a stock of musk oxen, imported from East Greenland in 1932.

The Dovrefjell area has now been almost entirely protected as two national parks:
* Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella National Park, founded 2002, which encompasses the previous and much smaller Dovrefjell National Park.
* Dovre National Park, founded 2003, connecting the protected areas in the Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella National Park with Rondane National Park.

The highest mountain in the region is the tall Snøhetta. The range provides cross-country skiing and hiking opportunities. The river Driva, running north through Oppdal Municipality, has its source in the Dovrefjell range.

==Name==
The first element refers to the geographic area, &quot;Dovre&quot;. The last element is &quot;fjell&quot; which means &quot;fell&quot; or &quot;mountain&quot;.

The name Dovre () belongs to a group of Scandinavian toponyms that the Swedish linguist Elof Hellquist has derived from a Proto-Norse , and linguists have further derived them from the old Proto-Indo-European root (cf. PIE , &quot;deep&quot;), a root that is also attested in German (&quot;forested valley&quot;) and Old Slavic (&quot;hole&quot;). There are several place names in Denmark, Norway and Sweden that are identified as related to &quot;Dovre&quot;:
;Denmark
* in the narrow valley &quot;Døvredal&quot;, in Bodilsker parish on Bornholm.
* a place with steep slopes in Lintrup parish in Haderslev amt.
* located among deeply cut banks of a small stream, in Skipdsted parish near Aalborg.
*, an old farm name, and the bay , with hilly terrain, in Ydby parish, near Thisted.
* a parish in Hjelmslev hundred in Århus amt. It has a hilly terrain with steep slopes.
;Norway
*Dovre herred () was originally the name of an old farm and it later became the name for the entire hundred.
* was the name of a lost farm in Biri hundred, but it survives in the name of a local meadow .
*, where the name is derived from and (&quot;meadow&quot;).

;Sweden
* (&quot;lakes of Dovra&quot;), which are three lakes (Northern/Upper, Middle, and Southern) in a fissure valley in Närke.
*, a farm located at the southernmost extension of the valley.
*, a long and narrow inlet of the lake Glan in Östergötland, and there is a strait named and a farm named .

The name has also been given to giants in Scandinavian legends. The name has been given to the giant , at Dovrefjell, who was helped by Harald Fairhair and in return assisted him all his life. In Närke, the Dovra lakes were attributed to the giantess &quot;Dovra&quot; who wept for her husband.

From the oldest times has Dovrefjell been the border region between the northern and southern parts of Norway, and the road over the mountain was well known. The expression &quot;til Dovre faller&quot; (&#x27;until the Dovre mountains fall&#x27;) is widely used in Norwegian. It was used in the oath sworn during the Norwegian Constituent Assembly in 1814, when Norway formed an independent nation after being in union with Denmark. At this time it was assumed that Snøhetta in Dovrefjell was the highest mountain in Norway, since the higher peaks in Jotunheimen were fairly unresearched.

==Geology==
Dovrefjell is a residual massif, which is a mass of rock that has stayed in place as the surrounding relief has been eroded. The tops of Jotunheimen and Dovrefjell and other parts of southern Norway are the few remnants (see summit accordance) of a formerly flat surface that existed in Norway before uplift. This surface is now largely eroded and warped. That erosion formed a series of steps and from the highest of these steps Jotunheimen rises.

<text>Félix Ziem (26 February 1821 – 10 November 1911) was a French painter in the style of the Barbizon School, who also produced some Orientalist works.

==Biography==
He was born Félix-Francois Georges Philibert Ziem in Beaune in the Côte-d&#x27;Or département of the Burgundy région of France. His mother was a native of Burgundy who had married an immigrant from Croatia. Originally, Ziem planned to be an architect, studied in the École des Beaux-Arts in Dijon, and for a time he worked as an architect. In 1839 he moved to Marseilles, where he received some informal instruction in painting from Adolphe Monticelli.

Painting developed from a hobby into a career following a visit in 1841 to Italy, where he fell in love with the city of Venice, a place that would become the source for many of his works, and to which he returned annually until 1892. Apart from Venetian scenes, he also painted many still lifes, portraits, and landscapes of diverse locations which reflected his travels. Following a year-long trip to the Ottoman Empire and Egypt in 1857-58, he began to include works with an Orientalist theme in his oeuvre. His landscapes included scenes from a variety of locations including Constantinople, Egypt, Martigues, Cagnes-sur-Mer and his native Burgundy. Ziem was a commercially successful artist in his own lifetime.

==Career==

Ziem&#x27;s works were first exhibited in 1849 at the Paris Salon, and Ziem remained a regular exhibitor there for many years. He also traveled extensively throughout Europe and in 1860 moved to Montmartre, the artistic quarter of the city of Paris. Financially successful, he was known to assist struggling young artists.

In 1857, the government of France recognized his contribution to the art world by making him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, and an officer of the Legion in 1878.

Félix Ziem died in 1911 and was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

<text>Maurice Félix Thomas (; 2 February 1876 – 4 August 1961), known as Maurice Tourneur (), was a French film director and screenwriter.

==Life==
Born Maurice Félix Thomas in the Épinettes district (17th arrondissement of Paris), his father was a wholesaler. As a young man, Maurice Thomas first trained as a graphic designer and a magazine illustrator but was soon drawn to the theater. In 1904, he married the actress Fernande Petit. They had a son, Jacques (1904–1977), who would follow his father into the film industry, establishing his own reputation as a director of American films in the 1940s and 1950s.

Using the stage name Maurice Tourneur, he began his show business career performing in secondary roles on stage and eventually toured England and South America as part of the theater company for the great star Gabrielle Réjane. Drawn to the new art of filmmaking, in 1911 he began working as an assistant director for the Éclair company. A quick learner and an innovator, within a short time he was directing films on his own using major French stars of the day such as Polaire.
In 1914, with the expansion of the giant French film companies into the United States market, Tourneur moved to New York City to direct silent films for Éclair&#x27;s American branch studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey before moving to William A. Brady&#x27;s World Film Corporation, where he directed important early American feature-length films such as &quot;The Wishing Ring&quot;, &quot;Alias Jimmy Valentine&quot;, &quot;The Cub&quot; (Martha Hedman&#x27;s only screen performance) and &quot;Trilby&quot;, the last starring Clara Kimball Young and noted stage actor Wilton Lackaye as Svengali. Before long, Maurice Tourneur was a major and respected force in American film and a founding member of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association. As the feature film evolved in the mid 1910s, he and his team (comprising screenwriter Charles Maigne, art director Ben Carré, and cameramen John van den Broek and Lucien Andriot) coupled exceptional technological skill with unique pictorial and architectural sensibilities in their productions, giving their films a visual distinctiveness that met with critical acclaim.
Tourneur admired D.W. Griffith and considered the skill level of American actors at the time ahead of their counterparts in Europe. Of the actresses he worked with, he called Mary Pickford the finest screen actress in the world and believed that stage actress Elsie Ferguson was a brilliant artist. However, Tourneur opposed the evolving star system that Carl Laemmle had begun with his advertising campaign for actress Florence Lawrence.

After directing several innovative films for Adolph Zukor&#x27;s Artcraft Pictures Corporation (which released through Paramount) in 1917 and 1918, Tourneur launched his own production company with the film &quot;Sporting Life&quot;. In 1921 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. By 1922 he believed that the future of the film industry lay in Hollywood and the following year he was hired by Samuel Goldwyn to go to the West Coast and make a film version of the Hall Caine novel &quot;The Christian&quot;. However, Tourneur&#x27;s career in the United States faltered in the 1920s as his pictorialism sometimes hampered the narrative drive of his later films, and he also separated from his wife Fernande in 1923. He was removed from production on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s version of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; in 1928, and this marked the end of his American career.

After his trouble with MGM, Tourneur decided to move back to his native France. There, he continued to make films both at home and in Germany, easily making the change to talkies. In 1933 he met his second wife, actress Louise Lagrange (1898–1979), while shooting his film, &quot;L&#x27;Homme mystérieux&quot;. Tourneur went on to direct another two dozen films, several of which were crime thrillers, until a 1949 automobile accident in which he was seriously injured and lost a leg. Health and age prevented him from directing more films, but a voracious reader and a skilled hobby artist, he kept busy painting and translating detective novels from English into French.

After his death in 1961, Maurice Tourneur was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Maurice Tourneur was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6243 Hollywood Blvd.

His 1917 film, &quot;The Poor Little Rich Girl&quot;, his 1918 film &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; and his 1920 film &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; have since been deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Recently, the American Film Institute&#x27;s Center for Film and Video Preservation and the National Archives of Canada have been cooperating on the restoration of Tourneur&#x27;s 1915 film, &quot;The Cub&quot;.

<text>A ground rule double is a baseball rule that awards two bases from the time of pitch to all baserunners including the batter-runner, as a result of the ball leaving play after being hit fairly and leaving the field under a condition of the ground rules in effect at the field where the game is being played. An automatic double is the term used to refer to a fairly hit ball leaving the field in circumstances that do not merit a home run, such as when the ball&#x27;s first bounce was within the field. The automatic double (or rule-book double) is commonly called a ground rule double.

==Application==
Major League Baseball (MLB) has a set of universal ground rules that apply at all ballparks, two of which award two bases to the batter and any baserunners:
* A batted ball lodged in the roof above fair territory (unless outlined otherwise in the home park ground rules)
* Any batted ball in fair territory that, in flight, strikes the facing of a lower wall and then bounds over a higher wall
Two bases can also be awarded per home park ground rules—rules created to provide for unique playing conditions of a specific ballpark. For example, ground rules govern the situation when a batted ball is lodged in the ivy at Wrigley Field, or the walkways near the ceiling of Tropicana Field, a domed stadium.

The far more commonly occurring automatic double results from the generally applicable MLB rules 5.05(a)(6) through 5.05(a)(9). These rules govern how to treat the batter (and any runners on base) when a batted ball is hit fair but passes out of the field of play or becomes artificially obstructed while in the field of play. For example, these rules cover balls that hit the ground in fair territory and land out of play, typically by bouncing over a fence or wall in the outfield. The rules also provide generically for the award of a double when a batted ball goes through or under a fence; and when it goes through or sticks in shrubbery or vines on the fence.
MLB rule 5.05(a)(9) governs when fair fly balls are deflected into the stands by a fielder: &quot;Any fair fly ball is deflected by the fielder into the stands, or over the fence into foul territory, in which case the batter shall be entitled to advance to second base; but if deflected into the stands or over the fence in fair territory, the batter shall be entitled to a home run. However, should such a fair fly be deflected at a point less than from home plate, the batter shall be entitled to two bases only.&quot; 

When two bases are awarded by either ground rules or the automatic rule, any baserunners ahead of the batter are entitled to advance two bases from their positions at the time of pitch. Only in the case of interference is the umpire vested with discretion to award more bases (see MLB rule 6.01). Application of the ground rule or automatic double rule can result in a runner at first base, who appears to have been able to score on a batted ball, being required to return to third base due to the ball going out of play.

==History==
In the early years of baseball, batted balls that cleared the fence in fair territory on the fly &quot;or after a bounce&quot; were counted as home runs. The rule was changed by the American League before the season and by the National League before the season. Baseball records did not differentiate between home runs that cleared the fence on the fly and those that bounced over. Notably, this includes most of Babe Ruth&#x27;s career, including when he hit 60 home runs in 1927, although there is no evidence any of Ruth’s home runs bounced before going over the fence. The last &quot;bounce&quot; home run in MLB was hit by Al López of the Brooklyn Robins on September 12, 1930, at Ebbets Field.

<text>Verena &quot;Vreni&quot; Schneider (born 26 November 1964) is a retired ski racer from Switzerland. She is the most successful alpine ski racer of her country, the fourth most successful female ski racer ever (after Lindsey Vonn, Annemarie Moser-Pröll and Mikaela Shiffrin) and was voted &quot;Swiss Sportswoman of the Century&quot;.

==Early life==
Schneider was born in Elm, the daughter of a shoemaker. Her mother died of cancer when Schneider was a teenager: as a result she put her ski career on hold and dropped out of school to look after the family home.

==Racing career==
Schneider made her World Cup debut at the age of 20. Schneider won the overall alpine skiing World Cup three times and eleven discipline World Cups in Slalom and Giant slalom, along with 55 World Cup races (number four all-time among women to Moser-Pröll, Vonn and Shiffrin). She also won five medals at the Winter Olympics including 3 golds (Slalom and giant slalom at Calgary in 1988 and Slalom at Lillehammer in 1994), and six medals at the World Championships including 3 more golds (Giant slalom at Crans-Montana in 1987 and Vail in 1989; Slalom at Saalbach in 1991).

During the 1988–89 season she won 14 World Cup races, a record for single season wins that stood until Shiffrin beat that record in the 2018–19 season.

In April 1995, after eleven successful seasons, she announced her retirement. Today she runs a ski and snowboard school in her home village of Elm as well as a sport equipment shop in Glarus.

Vreni Schneider is praised in the Half Man Half Biscuit song &#x27;Uffington Wassail&#x27; thus: &quot;Vreni Schneider – you’re my downhill lady! Vreni Schneider – you’re the queen of the slopes!&quot; The song is on the album &quot;Trouble Over Bridgwater&quot; from the year 2000.

<text>Claude Jean Allouez, SJ (June 6, 1622 – August 28, 1689) was a Jesuit missionary and French explorer of North America. He established a number of missions among the indigenous people living near Lake Superior.

== Biography ==
Allouez was born in Saint-Didier-en-Velay in the département of Haute-Loire in south-central France. In 1639, he graduated from the College of Le Puy, and became a Jesuit novice in Toulouse, France. In 1655, he was ordained a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. Allouez arrived in Quebec in 1658 and immediately began a study of the Wyandot and Anishinaabe languages to prepare himself for work as a missionary among the American Indian tribes along the St. Lawrence River.

In 1660 he became the superior of the mission at Trois-Rivières, Quebec. His stay there lasted until 1663 when he was named vicar general of a part of the diocese of Quebec that is now the central region of the United States. This appointment was made by Bishop François de Laval, the first bishop of New France.

From 1665 through 1669 Allouez made a missionary tour of the western missions. In 1667 he visited the village of the Nipissing Indians who had fled there during the Iroquois onslaught of 1649-50 and celebrated the first mass beside the Nipigon River May 29, 1667. He went back to Quebec in search of assistants, and immediately returned to the missions.

On December 3, 1669, Allouez said the first Mass in Oconto, Wisconsin. He served as a missionary to the Potawatomi. The Menominee began participating in the fur trade network and converting to Christianity. The next year he was with the Meskwaki, establishing St. Mark&#x27;s Mission, and founding the mission of St. James among the Miami and Mascouten peoples, finally returning to Green Bay later that year.

Because of his fluency in native languages and the prestige in which he was held by the Indian nations, in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, he was a principal speaker at the ceremony that formally declared the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River valley as territory of the King of France. In 1671 he founded the St. Francis Xavier Mission at the last set of rapids on the Fox River before entering Green Bay. The site was known as Rapides Des Pères (rapids of the fathers) which became modern day De Pere, Wisconsin. This became his base until word arrived of the death of Jacques Marquette, and Allouez was assigned to continue Marquette&#x27;s work among the Illinois. In February 1676, on his way to Lake Michigan, his companions rigged a sail on the canoe to sail over the ice. By March he was at Whitefish Bay and reached Kaskaskia by the end of the month.

He continued Marquette&#x27;s evangelizing of the Indians until his death in 1689, near what is today Niles, Michigan just north of South Bend, Indiana. He is buried in Niles.

A good portion of Father Allouez&#x27;s written work from the time has been preserved. It provides insight into the missions of the time and provides a record that is extensive and important of the Catholic Church in mid-America. It also contains the first documented accounts of the Illinois Indians. He is reputed to have baptized around 10,000 neophytes.

<text>The César Award for Best Actress () is one of the César Awards, presented annually by the &quot;Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma&quot; to recognize the outstanding performance in a leading role of an actress who has worked within the French film industry during the year preceding the ceremony. Nominees and winner are selected via a run-off voting by all the members of the Académie.

==History==
===Superlatives===
As of 2019, 82 actresses have been nominated in the category, with a total of 34 different winners. The average age at first nomination is 36 and the average age of winners at first win is 39.

With five wins (1982, 1984, 1989, 1995, 2010), Isabelle Adjani has the most Best Actress Césars. Six actresses have won two Best Actress Césars: Romy Schneider (1976, 1979), Sabine Azéma (1985, 1987), Catherine Deneuve (1981, 1993), Nathalie Baye (1983, 2006), Yolande Moreau (2005, 2009) and Isabelle Huppert (1996, 2017).

Adjani also holds the records for most César Awards in an acting category and for most Césars in a single artistic category. She is followed with 4 Césars by Dominique Blanc (1 Best Actress César and 3 Best Supporting Actress Césars) and Nathalie Baye (2 Best Actress Césars and 2 Best Supporting Actress Césars).

Isabelle Huppert holds the record of most nominations with 14. Including Best Supporting Actress, Huppert has been nominated a total of 16 times, which makes her the overall most-nominated female performer.

Virginie Efira hold the record of most consecutive nominations with 4 (2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024).

Cécile de France is the only actress to have been nominated for two different roles the same year, in 2007 for &quot;Avenue Montaigne&quot; and for &quot;When I Was a Singer&quot;. The Académie has since modified the nomination rules to ensure that no one could receive more than one individual nomination by category.

Eight women have won both the César Award for Best Actress and the César Award for Best Supporting Actress:
* Nathalie Baye (Best Supporting Actress in 1981 and 1982, Best Actress in 1983 and 2006)
* Annie Girardot (Best Actress in 1977, Best Supporting Actress in 1996 and 2002),

Nathalie Baye is the only actress with multiple wins in both categories. She is also the only performer to have won an acting César in three consecutive years, in 1981, 1982 and 1983.

Three films have received both accolades: &quot;One Deadly Summer&quot; in 1984 (Best Actress to Isabelle Adjani, Best Supporting Actress to Suzanne Flon), &quot;Indochine&quot; in 1993 (Best Actress to Catherine Deneuve, Best Supporting Actress to Dominique Blanc) and &quot;Queen Margot&quot; in 1995 (Best Actress to Isabelle Adjani, Best Supporting Actress to Virna Lisi).

Five women have won the César Award for Best Actress after previously winning the César Award for Most Promising Actress:
* Sandrine Bonnaire (Most Promising Actress in 1984, Best Actress in 1986),
* Élodie Bouchez (Most Promising Actress in 1995, Best Actress in 1999),
* Sylvie Testud (Most Promising Actress in 2001, Best Actress in 2004),
* Sara Forestier (Most Promising Actress in 2004, Best Actress in 2011),
* Sandrine Kiberlain (Most Promising Actress in 1996, Best Actress in 2014).

Only one film has received both accolades: &quot;The Dreamlife of Angels&quot; in 1999 (Best Actress to Élodie Bouchez, Most Promising Actress to Natacha Régnier).

Thirteen women have received nominations in the three competitive acting categories: Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Most Promising Actress. They are Emmanuelle Béart, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Dominique Blanc, Anne Brochet, Karin Viard, Sandrine Kiberlain, Emmanuelle Devos, Cécile de France, Marion Cotillard, Sylvie Testud, Émilie Dequenne, Sara Forestier and Adèle Haenel. So far, no actress has achieved to win the three awards.

To date, the longest-living winner is Emmanuelle Riva, who died at 89, and the most short-lived is Romy Schneider, who died at 43. The oldest alive winner is Catherine Deneuve, aged 77, and the earliest alive winner is Miou-Miou (&quot;Memoirs of a French Whore&quot;, 1980).

===Posthumous nominations===
There have been only two posthumous nominations for any acting César and both occurred in the Best Actress category. Romy Schneider was nominated in 1983 for &quot;The Passerby&quot;, seven months after her death possibly by suicide. Pascale Ogier died of a drug overdose at 25, three months before receiving a nomination for &quot;Full Moon in Paris&quot; in 1985.

Romy Schneider is the only actress to have been presented a posthumous Honorary César, in 2008. Actor Alain Delon presented the César, as the date also corresponded to the forty years of the iconic film &quot;La Piscine&quot; in which they starred together. During the standing ovation, he turned towards a giant portrait of the actress and declared in German that she was the love of his life.

===International presence===
As the César Awards are centered on the French Cinema, the majority of recipients are French and performed in French language. The non-French winners of the Best Actress César include Belgian actress Yolande Moreau (2005, 2009) and German actress Sandra Hüller (2024). Romy Schneider was born German, Virginie Efira was born Belgian and Bérénice Bejo was born Argentine, but all had become French naturalized citizens by the time of their wins.

International actresses who have received nominations are:
* Algeria: Soria Zeroual,
* Argentina: Bérénice Bejo, (she holds dual Argentine-French citizenship),
* Belgium: Cécile de France, Marie Gillain, Yolande Moreau, Émilie Dequenne, Virginie Efira (she holds dual Belgian-French citizenship),
* Denmark: Sidse Babett Knudsen,
* Germany: Nastassja Kinski, Barbara Sukowa, Sandra Hüller,
* Hong Kong: Maggie Cheung,
* Luxembourg: Vicky Krieps,
* Morocco: Loubna Abidar,
* Spain: Karla Sofia Gascón,
* Switzerland: Irène Jacob,
* United Kingdom: Jane Birkin, Charlotte Rampling, Tilda Swinton, Kristin Scott Thomas (she holds dual British-French citizenship),
* United States: Julia Migenes, Zoe Saldaña

The Best Actress César has been awarded twice for a foreign-language performance: to Isabelle Adjani for her English-language performance in &quot;Possession&quot; (1982) and to Sylvie Testud for her Japanese-language performance in &quot;Fear and Trembing&quot; (2004). In addition, Bérénice Bejo is the only performer in the history of the César to receive an award for a silent role, in &quot;The Artist&quot; (2012).

==Winners and nominees==
Following the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma (AATC)&#x27;s practice, the films below are listed by year of ceremony, which corresponds to the year following the film&#x27;s year of release. For example, the César for Best Actress of 2010 was awarded on February 27, 2010 for a performance in a film released between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009.

Actresses are selected via a two-round vote: first round to choose the nominees, second round to designate the winner. All the members of the Académie, without regard to their branch, are eligible to vote on both rounds. The number of nominees, initially set to four, was expanded to five in 1984 and then to seven in 2012.

Winners are listed first in bold, followed by the other nominees in alphabetic order.

<text>SAP Business One is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) application designed for small and medium-sized enterprises, and marketed by the German company SAP SE. As a company, SAP Business One focuses on automating key business functions in finance, operations, and human resources.

== History ==
SAP Business One was initially launched in Israel in 1996 under the name &quot;Menahel&quot; (&quot;manager&quot;) or &quot;TopManage&quot;, for other countries. The company was founded by Reuven Agassi (CEO). The product was designed by Shai Agassi and the development team was led by Hilla Mazinter. At a later stage the product was split out into a separate company that Reuven Agassi was running as CEO with Gadi Shamia was VP Sales

In its first years, TopManage was sold in the Israeli market only and was the first Windows/Mac business management product to be offered in the Israeli market. In 2000, TopManage started its global expansion into markets in Europe and Latin America.

In March 2002, SAP acquired the financial systems of &quot;TopManage&quot; and subsequently rebranded the system as SAP Business One. Reuven Agassi and Gadi Shamia, founders of TopManage, assumed executive positions at SAP as part of the acquisition. Notably, a year before this, SAP had also acquired &quot;TopTier,&quot; a sister company of TopManage. Shai Agassi, the son of Reuven Agassi, was the founder of TopTier. 

The acquisition allowed SAP to reach out to the small market through its partners and also to gain additional business from the smaller subsidiaries of its enterprise customers.

=== Releases ===
The history of SAP Business One:

* Resources, where master data of resources (machines and people) to be used in production are defined (capacity and planning) (only SAP 9.1 and higher)
* Production, where the Bill of Materials master data is maintained and Production orders are created
* Project Management, where projects are defined (what you do when) (only SAP 9.2 and higher)
* Material Requirements Planning (MRP), where forecasts of needed items in sales/production are defined in order to make purchase order recommendations
* Service, where management of service contracts are maintained and service calls are created
* Human Resources, where employee master data (names, contact information, roles, etc.) are maintained

* Mobile and Web Access, SAP Business One also supports mobile deployment and web access, facilitating real-time management of core business operations from anywhere.
Each module handles specific business tasks on its own, but is linked with other modules where applicable. For instance, an invoice from the billing transaction in Sales &amp; Distribution would pass through to accounting, where it will appear in accounts receivable and cost of goods sold.

== Architecture ==
SAP Business One is a typical Client–server model software product.

*Client software is primarily the SAP Business One client that is a Microsoft Windows-based product that connects to a back-end server. SAP also offers clients for phones and tablets (iOS and Android) that contain a subset of the full features aimed at sales employees.
*Server software is run on either a Microsoft SQL Server database (Windows) or SAP HANA database (Linux).

== Partners and community ==
SAP Business One is delivered through its global partner network (SAP PartnerEdge) consisting of the following partner types:

* Value-Added Resellers (VAR) is an SAP partner that sells, implements and supports the product to end customers.
* Software Solution Partners (SSP) is an SAP partner that creates horizontal or vertical standard solutions on top of the SAP Business One platform with the SAP Business One SDK and sells them via the VAR partners.
* Open Ecosystem Once you join you will be able to sell, service, and market SAP-approved products available through its distributor channel. It&#x27;s free and easy to join, with only a small amount of required training to complete before you begin.

== Extensibility ==
Custom development (called add-ons) are done using the SAP Business One SDK. It is COM-based development done in Microsoft Visual Studio with C# or VB.NET.

SAP Business One SDK consists of:
* Data Interface API (DI-API), where you can create new business object around the normal SAP Business One client but still adhere to the core business rules
* User interface API (UI-API), where you can modify existing SAP Business One client screens, create new screens and change/block the normal event flow
* SAP Business One Integration Technology (B1i), where you can visually create Business flows using XML/XSLT
* Service Layer for SAP HANA, where you can, using OData, create business objects
*Service Layer for Microsoft SQL Server, where you can, using OData, create business objects

<text>A two-decker is a sail warship which carried her guns on two fully armed decks. Usually additional guns were carried on the upper works (forecastle and quarterdeck), but this was not a continuous battery and thus not counted as a full gun deck.

Two-deckers ranged all the way from the small 40-gun Fifth rate up to 80- or even 90-gun ships of the line, with the third-rate of seventy-four guns, or &quot;seventy-four&quot;, being the archetype.

<doc id="1039473" wikidata="Q1282792" url="?curid=1039473" title="Eddie Gaven">
<text>Eddie Gaven (born October 25, 1986) is an American former soccer player who played 11 seasons in Major League Soccer, primarily with the Columbus Crew. In July 2012, Gaven became the youngest player to play in 250 MLS matches at 25 years and 257 days old.

==Early life==
Gaven was born in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and attended Steinert High School. He did not play college soccer; instead, Gaven spent two years training with other young Americans at the USSF&#x27;s Bradenton Academy.

==Professional career==
Gaven became (at the time, since passed by Freddy Adu) the youngest player to sign with MLS. At the age of 16 years and two months, Gaven was drafted by the MetroStars with the twelfth overall pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft. He became the youngest player in team history on his debut on June 14, 2003, against Chicago and became the youngest player in team history to score a goal, which he did in just his second game, against D.C. United on July 5. With the game tied at two, Metro coach Bob Bradley used a loophole in MLS&#x27;s substitution rules, which allowed a fourth substitution in a game but only for a goalkeeper. Bradley first exchanged the playing positions of Metro goalie Tim Howard and midfielder Mark Lisi, then substituted Gaven into goal for Lisi as the fourth &quot;goalkeeper only&quot; sub. After only 10 seconds of play, the ball went out of play and Gaven and Howard switched places, with Gaven moving to midfield and Howard back into goal. Gaven then went on to score the game-winner in overtime. In the process, Gaven became the youngest goalkeeper in MLS history. The goalkeeper fourth-substitution rule was eliminated after the season, largely due to the outcry following Gaven&#x27;s goal.

After becoming an automatic starter and coming into his own with the MetroStars in 2004, Gaven became the youngest player ever voted in to start the MLS All-Star Game, finished the MLS season with seven goals and seven assists, and became the youngest player in league history to be named to the MLS Best XI.

Gaven ended the 2005 MLS season with eight goals and four assists. Just before the 2006 season, Gaven was traded to Columbus Crew along with the rights to defender Chris Leitch for striker Edson Buddle. With the Crew, Gaven played nearly every game in 2006, scoring four goals. In 2007, he appeared in 27 games for Columbus scoring five goals and tallying seven assists. Gaven&#x27;s 2008 season resulted in lower output, three goals and two assists, due in part to starting the season injured. In the Eastern Conference Championship game, Gaven propelled the Crew into their first MLS Cup Final with a game-winning goal; the Crew went on to win the Final.

During the 2010 MLS season in a game against the Philadelphia Union, Gaven was forced to play in goal for the second time in his MLS career after goalkeeper William Hesmer went out of the game with a shoulder injury. The Crew had used all three substitutions prior to Hesmer&#x27;s injury. Gaven was scored on by Sebastian LeToux during the final minutes of the game, but made two saves to help the Crew win the game 3–1. Gaven would go on to win MLS Save of the Week honors for one of the saves.

Gaven signed a contract extension for two years plus option years with Columbus on November 14, 2011.

Gaven missed most of the 2013 season after an injury suffered during a Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup match. He retired following the 2013 season.

==International career==
Gaven played every minute for the U.S. in the 2003 Under-17 World Championship in Finland. He then became the youngest player (17 years 104 days) in CONCACAF history to appear in an Olympic qualifier when he played for the U.S. Under-23 team in a 2–0 victory over Canada on February 5, 2004. He then became the fourth youngest player in US history to get his a senior cap, doing so in a 1–1 against Poland on July 11, 2004.

In 2005, after continuing his solid play with the MetroStars, Gaven was part of the U.S. Under-20 team at the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship in the Netherlands.

==Coaching career==
Following his retirement from soccer in 2013, he moved to Ave Maria University as Head Men&#x27;s Soccer Coach from March 2016 through 2022.

==Personal life==
Gaven is a devout Catholic.

<text>Versed is a book of poetry written by Rae Armantrout and published by Wesleyan University Press in 2009 (see 2009 in poetry). It won the 2009 National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry and the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry after being named a finalist for the National Book Award. Armantrout is only the third poet to win two out of these three awards in one year.

==Awards==
As part of a lead-in to their awards announcement, NBCC board member James Marcus called &quot;Versed&quot; a collection of &quot;vigilant, often beautiful poems [that] seem to reset the reader’s mental instrumentation—what Armantrout calls the &#x27;whirligig / of attention, / the figuring and / reconfiguring / of charges / among orbits / (obits) / that has taken forever.&#x27;&quot;

According to the Pulitzer Prize Board, &quot;Versed&quot; is a &quot;book striking for its wit and linguistic inventiveness, offering poems that are often little thought-bombs detonating in the mind long after the first reading.&quot;

In the Middle Ages the Castle of Breno had two towers, one belonging to the Guelph family Ronchi, the other to the Ghibelline family Alberzoni. In the 1397 peace of Breno between Guelphs and Ghibellines, the representatives of the community of Breno sided both with the Ghibellines and the Guelphs.

During the Republic of Venice rule Breno was the seat of the Community of Val Camonica. Breno today is the seat of the Comunità montana di Valle Camonica.

The emblem of the province of Brescia is the group of five blazons: that of Brescia in the center, the town of Chiari, Breno, Verolanuova and Salò.

<text>Anděl is a lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged central highlands of the Moon. It was named after the Czech astronomer Karel Anděl. Nearby craters of note include Abulfeda to the south-southeast and Descartes to the east-southeast. About 85 kilometres to the east-northeast of the outer rim is the landing site of the Apollo 16 mission.

The eroded outer rim of Anděl has been worn and distorted into a polygonal shape, and is nearly non-existent to the south where Anděl G intersects the perimeter. The interior floor is nearly flat, with some irregularities to the southeast. There is a tiny craterlet located just to the southeast of the midpoint, but no central peak of any significance.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Anděl.

<doc id="1039491" wikidata="Q259447" url="?curid=1039491" title="History of the Jews in Norway">
<text>The history of Jews in Norway dates back to the 1400s. Although there were very likely Jewish merchants, sailors and others who entered Norway during the Middle Ages, no efforts were made to establish a Jewish community. Through the early modern period, Norway, still devastated by the Black Death, was ruled by Denmark from 1536 to 1814 and then by Sweden until 1905. In 1687, Christian V rescinded all Jewish privileges, specifically banning Jews from Norway, except with a special dispensation. Jews found in the kingdom were jailed and expelled, and this ban persisted until 1851.

In 1814, when Norway gained independence from Denmark, the general ban against Jews entering the country was &quot;continued&quot; in the new Norwegian Constitution. Sephardim were exempt from the ban, but it appears that few applied for a letter of free passage. After tireless efforts by the poet Henrik Wergeland, politician Peder Jensen Fauchald, school principal Hans Holmboe and others, in 1851 the Norwegian parliament (the Stortinget) lifted the ban against Jews and they were awarded religious rights on a par with Christian dissenters.
The first Jewish community in Norway was established in Oslo in 1892. The community grew slowly until World War II. It was bolstered by refugees in the late 1930s and peaked at about 2,100. The population was devastated during the Holocaust, in which a significant portion of the Norwegian Jewish community was murdered by Nazi Germany. Jews remain one of Norway&#x27;s smallest ethnic and religious minorities.

==Middle Ages==
The first mention of Jews in Norse literature is found in Postola sögur in Iceland in the 13th century, where they are mentioned along with the more general pagans. The literature of this time referred to Jews as , , or in the Latin form . Jews were also mentioned in unfavorable terms in subsequent literary Icelandic sagas, such as Gyðinga saga (Saga of the Jews).

However, there are sources that dispute anti-Semitism in Norway in the Middle Ages for the simple reason that there was no evidence of the presence of Jews in the country. A comprehensive study of contemporaneous documents, for instance, such as testaments, contracts, and legal cases among other primary data did not mention Jews or a Jewish community in Norway. Scholars cited that those mentioned in Church documents can be considered &quot;virtual Jews&quot; in the sense that the citations were indirect and that these mentions were probably symbols of non-Christian behavior.

==Reformation and Enlightenment==
In 1436 and again in 1438, Archbishop Aslak Bolt prohibited celebrating a day of rest on Saturday, lest Christians replicate the &quot;way of Jews,&quot; and this prohibition was reinforced through several subsequent ordinances, including those in Diplomatarium Norvegicum.

The first known settlement of Jews on Norway territory was based on a royal dispensation. The first known mention of Jews in public documents relates to the admissibility of Sephardim, Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497. Some of these were given special dispensation to enter Norway.

While Norway was part of the Danish kingdom from 1536 to 1814, Denmark introduced a number of religious restrictions both to uphold the Protestant Reformation in general and against Jews in particular. In 1569, Fredrik II ordered that all foreigners in Denmark had to affirm their commitment to 25 articles of faith central to Lutheranism, on pain of deportation, forfeiture of all property, and death.

The earliest recorded direct mention of Jews occurred in documents published in the 17th century when a group of Portuguese Jews were allowed to settle in Norway. Restrictions were lifted for Sephardic Jews already established as merchants in Altona when Christian IV took over the town. Christian also issued the first letter of safe passage to a Jew (Albert Dionis) in 1619, and on June 19, 1630, general amnesty was granted to all Jews permanently in residence in Glückstadt, including the right to travel freely throughout the kingdom.

In this condition, the existence of anti-Semitism can be considered negligible because the traditional Jewish prejudice often stemmed from the perception that the Jews controlled the economic, political and social spheres of a specific European society. However, this argument&#x27;s attempt to downplay antisemitism is internally contradictory, since that perception of Jews is itself one of the most prominent and enduring signs of antisemitism.

Public policy toward Jews varied over the next several hundred years. The kings generally tolerated Jewish merchants, investors, and bankers whose contributions of benefit to the economy of Denmark-Norway on the one hand, while seeking to restrict their movements, residence, and presence in public life. Several Jews, particularly in the Sephardic Teixeira family, but also some of Ashkenazi origins, were given letters of passage to visit places in Denmark and Norway; but there were also several incidents of Jews who were arrested, imprisoned, fined, and deported for violating the general ban against their presence, even when they claimed the exemption granted to Sephardim. Christian IV of Denmark-Norway gave Jews limited rights to travel within the kingdom and, in 1641, Ashkenazi Jews were given equivalent rights. Christian V rescinded these privileges in 1687, specifically banning Jews from Norway, unless they were given a special dispensation. Jews found in the kingdom were jailed and expelled, and this ban persisted until 1851.

The European Enlightenment led to moderate easing of restrictions for Jews in Denmark-Norway, especially in Denmark&#x27;s southern areas and cities. Some Jewish families that had converted to Christianity settled in Norway. Writers of the time increased their interest in the Jewish people, including Ludvig Holberg, who figured Jews as comical figures in most of his plays and in 1742 wrote &quot;The Jewish History From the Beginning of the World, Continued till Present Day&quot;, presenting Jews to some extent in conventional, unfavorable stereotypes, but also raising the question about mistreatment of Jews in Europe.

Consequently, as stereotypes against Jews started entering the awareness of the general public during the Enlightenment, there were also those who rose in opposition to some, if not all, of the underlying hostility. Lutheran minister Niels Hertzberg was one of those who wrote against Norwegian prejudice, ultimately influencing the later votes on the constitutional amendment to allow Jews to settle in Norway.

==Constitutional ban==

There was a blanket ban on Jewish presence in Norway since 1687, except with a special dispensation, and Jews found in the kingdom were jailed and expelled. The ban persisted until 1851. Based on short-lived hopes that Denmark&#x27;s concessions at the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 would allow for Norwegian independence, a constituent assembly was convened in Eidsvoll in the spring of 1814. Although Denmark had only a few months earlier completely lifted all restrictions on Jews, the Norwegian assembly, after some debate, went the other way, and Jews were to &quot;continue&quot; to be excluded from the realm, as part of the clause that made Lutheranism the official state religion, though with free exercise of religion as the general rule. The ban was against Jews and Jesuits entering the country. Sephardim were exempt from the ban, but it appears that few applied for a letter of free passage. On 4 November 1844, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice declared: &quot;…it is assumed that the so-called Portuguese Jews are, regardless of the Constitution&#x27;s §2, entitled to dwell in this country, which is also, to [our] knowledge, what has hitherto been assumed.&quot;

Several of the framers had formulated views on Jews before the convention had started, among them Lauritz Weidemann, who wrote that &quot;The Jewish nation&#x27;s history proves, that this people always has been rebellious and deceitful, and their religious teachings, the hope of again arising as a nation, so often they have acquired some remarkable fortune, led them to intrigues and to create a state within a state. It is of vital importance to the security of the state that an absolute exception be made about them.&quot;

Those who supported the continued ban did so for several reasons, among them theological prejudice. Nicolai Wergeland and Georg Sverdrup felt that it would be incompatible with Judaism to deal honestly with Christians, writing that &quot;no person of the Jewish faith may come within Norway&#x27;s borders, far less reside there.&quot; Peter Motzfeld also supported the ban, but on the slightly different basis that the Jewish identity was too strong to allow for full citizenship. Other prominent framers, such as Hans Christian Ulrik Midelfart spoke &quot;beautifully&quot; in defense of the Jews, and also Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg expressed in more muted terms the backwardness of the proposition.

Those who opposed admission of Jews prevailed decisively when the matter was put to a vote, and the second paragraph of constitution read:

This effectively maintained the legal status quo from about 1813 but put Norway sharply at odds with trends in both Denmark and Sweden, where laws and decrees in the early 19th century were granting Jews greater, not more limited liberties.

Meanwhile, a small number of Jewish converts to Christianity had settled in Norway, some of them rising to prominence. Among them were Ludvig Mariboe, Edvard Isak Hambro, and Heinrich Glogau. In 1817, Glogau had challenged Christian Magnus Falsen, one of the proponents of the ban against Jews at the constitutional assembly about the meaning of the prohibition, asking whether he should be embarrassed by his ancestors or his homeland when relating his legacy to his children. Falsen responded by asserting that Judaism &quot;carries nothing but ridicule and contempt toward the person that does not profess to it...making it a duty for each Jew to destroy [all nations that accept him].&quot;

Indeed, a number of Jews who found themselves in Norway were fined and deported. A ship bound for England foundered off the west coast of Norway in 1817, and one of those who washed ashore was Michael Jonas, a Polish Jew. He was escorted out of the country under heavy guard. This heavy-handed approach caused consternation, and the chief of police in Bergen was ordered to personally pay for the costs of the deportation. There were also deportation proceedings against suspected Jews who could not produce a baptismal certificate, among them the singer Carl Friedrich Coppello (alias Meyer Marcus Koppel), opticians Martin Blumenbach and Henri Leia, Moritz Lichtenheim, and others.

==Repeal and initial immigration==

The deportation of Jews who had either come to Norway by accident or in good faith caused some embarrassment among Norwegians. The first who advocated for a repeal was the poet Andreas Munch in 1836. But it was Henrik Wergeland who became the leading champion for the Jews in Norway.

===10th parliamentary session, 1842===
Henrik Wergeland was the son of Nikolai Wergeland, one of the members at the constitutional assembly who had most strongly objected to admitting Jews to the country. The younger Wergeland had long harbored prejudice against Jews, but travels in Europe had changed his mind. He published the pamphlet &quot;Indlæg i Jødesagen&quot; on August 26, 1841, arguing passionately for a repeal of the clause. On February 19, 1842, his efforts to put the matter to a vote in the Norwegian parliament was successful, when the proposition was referred to the Constitution Committee. On September 9, 1842, the motion to repeal won a simple majority: 51 to 43, but, falling short of a supermajority (2/3) it failed.

On October 26, 1842, Wergeland published his book &quot;Jødesagen i det norske Storthing&quot; (&quot;The Jewish issue in the Norwegian parliament&quot;), which in addition to arguing for the cause also provides interesting insights into the workings of the parliament at the time.

===Parliamentary sessions in 1845, 1848, and 1851===
Wergeland had submitted a new proposal to parliament later on the same day that the first repeal had failed. He died on July 12, 1845. The constitution committee referred their recommendation to repeal exactly a month after his death, on August 12. Several versions were put to vote, but the most popular version won 52 votes to repeal, only 47 to keep; worse than the last vote.

In 1848, the motion to repeal earned 59 to 43 votes, still falling short of the 2/3 required. In 1851, finally, the clause was repealed with 93 votes to 10. On September 10, all remaining legislation related to the ban was repealed by the passage of &quot;Lov om Ophævelse af det hidtil bestaaende Forbud mot at Jøder indfinde sig i Riget m.v.&quot; (&quot;Law regarding the repeal of the hitherto permanent prohibition against Jews in the realm, etc.&quot;)

==Early 20th century media, public opinion and policy==
In spite of fears that Norway would be overwhelmed by Jewish immigration following the repeal, only about 25 Jews immigrated to Norway before 1870. Because of pogroms in Czarist Russia, however, the immigration accelerated somewhat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1910, there were about 1,000 Jews in Norway.

Though the minority was small and widely dispersed, several stereotypes of Jews gained currency in the Norwegian press and popular literature in the early 20th century. In books by the widely read authors Rudolf Muus and Øvre Richter Frich, Jews are described as sadistic and obsessed with money. The attorney Eivind Saxlund published a pamphlet &quot;Jøder og Gojim&quot; (&quot;Jews and Goyim&quot;) in 1910, which was characterized in 1922 as &quot;antisemitic smut literature&#x27; by a writer in &quot;Dagbladet&quot;. Saxlund sued for libel and lost, but earned the admiration of the newspaper &quot;Nationen&quot;, who praised Saxlund for fighting &quot;our race war.&quot; In 1920, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was published in Norway under the title &quot;Den nye verdenskeiser&quot; (&quot;The New World Emperor&quot;).

In 1916 Norwegian writer Mikal Sylten published an antisemitic periodical called Nationalt Tidsskrift. In 1917 he started using the Swastika as its symbol, several years before Adolf Hitler. The periodical was of a racist nature and published Antisemitic conspiracy theories. The periodical declared itself as the &quot;only Norwegian journal that studies in depth Jewish true ties to events in the world and here at home&quot; . An attache called &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Jewish World&quot; was printed four editions starting 1925. This pamphlet contained a list of Jews and presumed Jews in Norway, sorted by occupation. Housewives and children were listed under &quot;Different Occupations&quot;. Sylten was tried for his collaboration with the Nazis during the German occupation in the legal purge in Norway after World War II.

==Shechita controversy==
Prejudice against Jews became a focal point in the controversy about the legality of &quot;shechita&quot;, the Jewish practice of ritual slaughter. The issue had originally been raised in the 1890s, but a municipal ban on the practice in 1913 in Oslo brought the matter to national attention.

===Early opposition===
Efforts to ban &quot;shechita&quot; put well-intended humane society activists in league with antisemitic individuals. In particular, Jonas Søhr, a senior police official, took a particular interest and eventually rose to the leadership of the Norwegian Federation for Animal Protection, while also opposing admission of Jewish refugees during World War I. The animal rights cause was used as a means to attack not just the method of slaughter, but also the community itself. 

Those opposing the ban included Fridtjof Nansen, but the division on the issue crossed party lines in all mainstream parties, except the Agrarian Party (today, the Centre Party), which was consistent in its opposition to &quot;schechita&quot;. During the 1890s, protests were raised in the Norwegian press against the practice of &quot;shechita&quot;, on the grounds that it was cruel to animals. The Jewish community responded to these objections by stating that the method was humane.

A committee commissioned on 11 February 1927 consulted numerous experts and visited a slaughterhouse in Copenhagen. Its majority favored a ban and found support in the Department of Agriculture and the parliamentary agriculture committee. Those who opposed a ban spoke of religious tolerance, and also found that &quot;schechita&quot; was no more inhumane than other slaughter methods. Ingvar Svanberg writes that many of the arguments against &quot;shechita&quot; were based &quot;on the distrust of &#x27;foreign&#x27; habits&quot; and &quot;often contained anti-Semitic elements&quot;. C. J. Hambro was one of those most appalled by the antisemitic invective, noting that &quot;where animal rights are protected to an exaggerated extent, it usually is done with the help of human sacrifice&quot;.

===1929 ban===
The controversy continued until 1929, when the Norwegian parliament banned the practice of slaughtering animals which have not been first stunned or paralyzed. The ban remains in force today.

No forms of religious slaughter are named as being banned in the Norwegian legislation. Norwegian law requires that animals be stunned before being slaughtered, without exception for religious practices, which is incompatible with &quot;shechita&quot;. The Norwegian Islamic Council, on the other hand, has found that sedation is compatible with &quot;halal&quot; rules, provided that the animal&#x27;s heart is still beating at the time of slaughter. 

===Continued debate===
The former chief rabbi of Norway, Michael Melchior, argued that antisemitism is one motive for the bans: &quot;I won&#x27;t say this is the only motivation, but it&#x27;s certainly no coincidence that one of the first things Nazi Germany forbade was kosher slaughter. I also know that during the original debate on this issue in Norway, where &quot;shechitah&quot; has been banned since 1930, one of the parliamentarians said straight out, &#x27;If they don&#x27;t like it, let them go live somewhere else.&#x27;&quot;

Representatives of both Muslim and Jewish communities, citing scientific studies, dispute the assertion that traditional &quot;halal&quot; and kosher slaughtering methods lead to unnecessary animal suffering. Norway&#x27;s acceptance of hunting, whaling and sealing were also raised as proof of the alleged hypocrisy of the Norwegian position. Minister of Agriculture, Lars Peder Brekk of the Centre Party (which has always rejected &quot;shechita&quot;, see above), rejected the comparison.

Proponents of the continued ban, including officials from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority claimed that animals slaughtered according to &quot;shechita&quot; were conscious for &quot;several minutes&quot; after they were slaughtered, and writer and farmer Tore Stubberud claimed that animals in Judaism had &quot;no moral status... pure objects for ... archaic, religious needs&quot;, and wondered whether the EU, in allowing for such slaughter had become &quot;purely a bank, without values&quot;.

To get around the ban, kosher meat has had to be imported into the country. In June 2019, it was proposed to extend the ban to imports of kosher meat. The proposal has also been described as antisemitic.

==Holocaust==


Niels Christian Ditleff was a Norwegian diplomat who in the late 1930s was posted to Warsaw, Poland. In the spring of 1939, Ditleff set up a transit station in Warsaw for Jewish refugees from Czechoslovakia that had been sent there through the sponsorship of Nansenhjelpen. Ditleff arranged for the refugees to receive food, clothing, and transportation to Gdynia, Poland, where they boarded ships bound for Norway. Nansenhjelpen was a Norwegian humanitarian organization founded by Odd Nansen in 1936 to provide safe haven and assistance in Norway for Jewish refugees from areas in Europe under Nazi control. The sanctuary in Norway was only short lived.

Nazi Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, and a number of Norwegians were immediately arrested, and two months later the occupying force established the first prisoners&#x27; camp at Ulven, outside Bergen. Many Jews who could, fled the country. &quot;Nearly two-thirds of the Jews in Norway fled from Norway&quot;. Of these, around 900 Jews were smuggled out of the country by the Norwegian resistance movement, mostly to Sweden but some also to the United Kingdom. In 1942, before deportations started, there were at least 2,173 Jews in Norway. Of these, 1,643 were Norwegian citizens, 240 were foreign citizens, and 290 were stateless. At least 765 Jews died in German hands; more than half of the Norwegians who died. Only between 28 and 34 of those deported survived their continued imprisonment in camps (following their deportation)and around 25 (of these) returned to Norway after the war.

During the War, the civilian Norwegian police (&quot;politiet&quot;) in many cases helped the German occupiers to arrest those Jews who failed to escape in time. In the middle of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, there were at least 2,173 Jews in Norway. Records show that during the Holocaust, 758 Norwegian Jews were murdered by the Nazis — mostly in Auschwitz. In addition, at least 775 Jews were arrested, detained, and/or deported. Most of the Jews who survived did so by fleeing the country, mostly to Sweden, but some also to the United Kingdom. The Jews fleeing to Sweden were in many cases assisted by the Norwegian resistance, but sometimes had to pay guides. A few also survived in camps in Norway or in hospitals, or in hiding. All Jews in Norway were either deported and murdered, were imprisoned, had fled to Sweden, or were in hiding by 27 November 1942. Many of the Jews who fled during the War did not return and, in 1946, there were only 559 Jews left in Norway. Between 1947 and 1949, the Norwegian government gave permission for 500 displaced persons to live in the country, although many later left for Israel, Canada, or the United States. About 800 Norwegian Jews who had fled to Sweden returned. By the mid-1950s, about 1,000 Jews resided in Norway, of whom 700 lived in Oslo and 150 in Trondheim.

Forty-one Norwegians have been recognized by Yad Vashem as being Righteous Among the Nations, as well as the Norwegian resistance movement collectively.

==1990s: World War II restitution==
In March 1996, the Norwegian government appointed a Committee &quot;to establish what happened to Jewish property during World War II … and to determine to what extent seized assets/property was restored after the War.&quot;

In June 1997, the Committee delivered a divided report, split into a majority and a minority:
* the majority view of uncovered losses was estimated to be 108 million Norwegian krone (kr), based on the value of the krone in May 1997 (≈US$15 million).
* the minority view of uncovered losses was estimated to be 330 million kr.

On 15 May 1998, the Prime Minister of Norway, Kjell Magne Bondevik, proposed 450 million kr, covering both a &#x27;collective&#x27; and an &#x27;individual&#x27; restitution. On 11 March 1999, the Stortinget voted to accept the proposition for 450 million kr. The collective part, totaling 250 million kr, was divided into three:
* Funds to sustain the Jewish community in Norway (150 million kr).
* Support for development, outside Norway, of the traditions and culture which the Nazis wished to exterminate, to be distributed by a foundation where the executive committee members are to be appointed one each by the Norwegian Government, the Norwegian Parliament, the Jewish community in Norway, and the World Jewish Congress/World Jewish Restitution Organization. Eli Wiesel was suggested to lead the executive committee (60 million kr).
* The formation of a national museum for tolerance, established as the Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities (40 million kr).

The individual part was estimated to total not more than 200 million kr, as compensation to individuals and their survivors, with a maximum of 200,000 kr each. By 31 November 1999, the last date for individuals to apply for compensation, 980 people had received 200,000 kr (≈US$26,000) each, totaling 196 million kr (≈US$25 million).

However, Norwegian estate law imposes estate tax on inheritance passing from the deceased to his/her heirs depending on the relationship between the two. This tax was compounded at each step of inheritance. As no death certificates had been issued for Jews murdered in German concentration camps, the deceased were listed as missing. Their estates were held in probate pending a declaration of death and charged for administrative expenses. So, by the time all these factors had their effect on the valuation of the confiscated assets, very little was left. In total, 7.8 million kr was awarded to principals and heirs of Jewish property confiscated by the Nazis. This was less than the administrative fees charged by governmental agencies for probate. It did not include assets seized by the government that belonged to non-Norwegian citizens, and that of citizens that left no legal heirs. This last category was formidable, as 230 entire Jewish households were killed during the course of the Holocaust.

==Contemporary situation==

, there were about 1,500 Jewish people living in the country as a whole. The number of registered members in religious Jewish communities has been declining in recent years, and was 747 in 2015. Most of these were based in Oslo.

There are two synagogues in Norway, one in Oslo and one in Trondheim. The Oslo Synagogue runs a full cradle-to-grave range of facilities, including a kindergarten and cheder. They both also have an outreach program to gather still functioning groups in Bergen and Stavanger. In June 2004, Chabad-Lubavitch established a permanent presence in Oslo, also organising activities in other parts of Norway. Oslo also has a Jewish renewal rabbi who organises services and activities. There was a Society for Progressive Judaism in Oslo, which no longer exists. The Jewish community in Norway is represented by Det Mosaiske Trossamfund (The Mosaic Community), which is affiliated with the World Jewish Congress. Other Jewish organizations in Norway include B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, WIZO, B’nei Akiva, Keren Kayemet, Help the Jews Home (Hjelp Jødene Hjem), a Kosher Meals on Wheels, Jewish study circles, and a home for the elderly. There is also a Jewish community center in Trondheim.

Norwegian Jews are well integrated into Norwegian society, and prominent among them were Jo Benkow, a former president of the Stortinget; Leo Eitinger and Berthold Grünfeld, both notable psychiatrists; Robert Levin, the pianist; writer, actress and theater critic and Bente Kahan, an actress and singer. Of these, only the last two are still living.

==Antisemitism in Norway==

The mainstream Norwegian political environment has strongly adopted a platform that rejects antisemitism. However, individuals often privately hold antisemitic views.

There have been episodes of vandalization of the Oslo Synagogue. In July 2006, during the 2006 Lebanon War, the congregation issued an advisory warning Jews not to wear kippot or other identifying items in public for fear of harassment or assault.

On 17 September 2006, the Oslo Synagogue was attacked with an automatic weapon, only days after it was made public that the building had been the planned target for the Algerian terror group GSPC that had been plotting a bombing campaign in the Norwegian capital. On 2 June 2008, Arfan Qadeer Bhatti was convicted for the shooting attack and given an eight-year preventive custody sentence for serious vandalism. The Oslo city court judge could not find sufficient evidence that the shots fired at the synagogue amounted to a terrorist act. The synagogue in Oslo is now under continuous surveillance and protected by barriers.

In August 2006, the writer Jostein Gaarder published an op-ed in Aftenposten, titled &quot;God&#x27;s Chosen People&quot;. It was highly critical of Israel, as well as Judaism as a religion. Allegations of antisemitism and an intense public debate resulted in the Jostein Gaarder controversy.

In December 2008, Imre Hercz filed a complaint to the Norwegian Press Complaints Commission against Otto Jespersen, a comedian who mocked the Holocaust, but fellow comics and his TV station backed the performer. Jespersen joked on national television in his weekly routine that &quot;I would like to take the opportunity to remember all the billions of fleas and lice that lost their lives in German gas chambers, without having done anything wrong other than settling on persons of Jewish background.&quot; Jespersen also presented a satirical monologue on antisemitism that ended with, &quot;Finally, I would like to wish all Norwegian Jews a Merry Christmas – no, what am I saying! You don&#x27;t celebrate Christmas, do you!? It was you who crucified Jesus,&quot; on 4 December. Jespersen has received criticism for several of his attacks on social and ethnic groups as well as royalty, politicians and celebrities, and in defence of the monologue TV 2 noted that Jespersen attacks in all directions, and that &quot;if you should take [the monologue] seriously, there are more than just the Jews that should feel offended&quot;.

In 2010, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation reported that antisemitism was common among Norwegian Muslims. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims reported that Muslim students often &quot;praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews&quot;, that &quot;Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students&quot; and that &quot;Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the Holocaust&quot;. One Jewish father also told how his child had been taken after school by a Muslim mob, &quot;to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew&quot;. (The child escaped.) In February 2015, however, a group of young Muslims organised 1,500 people to form two &#x27;rings of peace&#x27; around the synagogues in Oslo and Bergen in response to recent terror attacks against Jewish centers in Europe.

Unconnected with Norwegian Muslims, antisemitic graffiti was sprayed on a school and sports facility in Skien in August 2014. Later that year, a swastika was carved into the glass doors of the Trøndelag Theater, the day after the premiere of a Jewish puppet theater performance. In October 2014, a Jewish cemetery was vandalized in Trondheim, with sprayed marks and the word &#x27;Führer&#x27; scribbled on the chapel.

An article published by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs stated that antisemitism in Norway comes mainly from the leadership – politicians, organization leaders, church leaders, and senior journalists. Despite dissenting opinions, it claims that antisemitism in Europe originated in Muslim immigration, this essay blames the European-Christian leadership for antisemitism that began around 1000 CE, centuries before Jews came to Norway. Another issue arising from the article is the publishing of antisemitic caricatures. Since the 1970s, many pro-Palestinian caricatures have been published in the Norwegian media. But a comparison of those depictions with antisemitic caricatures from the Nazi-era show some similarities. Common motifs such as &#x27;Jews are evil and inhuman&#x27;, &#x27;Jews rule and exploit the world&#x27; and &#x27;Jews hate peace and propagate wars&#x27; are repeated in more recently published drawings, as well as in antisemitic sketches from the beginning of the twentieth century.

According to an ADL telephone survey of 501 people, 15% (+/-4.4%) of the adult population in Norway harbor antisemitic attitudes and 40% of the population agree with the statement, &quot;Jews are more loyal to Israel than to Norway&quot;, and 31% think that, &quot;Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust.&quot; However, this survey has been criticized for being unreasonably simplistic in its classification of &quot;harboring antisemitic attitudes&quot;.

<text>Henriette Caillaux (born 5 December 1874 – 29 January 1943) was a Parisian socialite and second wife of the former Prime Minister of France, Joseph Caillaux. On March 16, 1914, she shot and killed Gaston Calmette, editor of the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;.

==Early life and marriages==
Henriette Caillaux was born Henriette Raynouard, at Rueil-Malmaison on 5 December 1874. At the age of 19, she married Léo Claretie, a writer twelve years her senior. They had two children. In 1907 she began an affair with Joseph Caillaux while both he and she were still married. In 1908, she divorced Claretie; Caillaux had more difficulties in divorcing his wife, but he eventually did so and they married in October 1911.

She claimed she found in her second marriage &quot;the most complete happiness&quot;; their joint assets were worth around 1.5 million francs, placing them among France&#x27;s wealthiest couples and allowing them to live in what she described as &quot;great comfort&quot;. The circumstances of the marriage, along with substantial public scrutiny by political enemies, however, opened up lines of attack against the couple in terms of moral corruption.

==Murder of Gaston Calmette==
===Background===
===The shooting===
In the evening of 16 March 1914, Madame Caillaux entered the offices of &quot;Le Figaro&quot; wearing a large fur coat with her hands in a fur muff and asked to see Gaston Calmette. When told he was away but would return within an hour, she sat to wait. She was ushered into Calmette&#x27;s office around 6 pm. Asking whether the editor knew why she had come, Calmette answered in the negative; immediately afterward, Henriette Caillaux fired six shots from a Browning automatic pistol into Calmette&#x27;s abdomen, mortally wounding him.

Henriette Caillaux made no attempt to escape and newspaper workers in adjoining offices quickly apprehended her and summoned a doctor and the police. Demanding not to be touched, she attempted to defend herself, saying that &quot;there is no longer any justice in France&quot; but was told curtly to be quiet. She refused to be transported to the police headquarters in a police van, insisting on being driven there by her chauffeur in her own car, which was still parked outside. The police agreed to this and she was formally charged upon reaching the headquarters. Gaston Calmette died six hours after being shot.

===Trial===
After substantial publicity and a lengthy investigation, her trial opened at the Paris Cour d&#x27;assises on 20 July 1914, where it promptly dominated French news. The trial, which included a sexual scandal and a &quot;crime passionel&quot; by a society French lady, received twice as many column inches in &quot;Le Temps&quot; as the ongoing July Crisis which culminated in the First World War, even as late as three days before the start of hostilities.

Because of the lax legal and procedural restraints in the &quot;cour d&#x27;assises&quot;, the conduct of the trial &quot;seemed almost structured for drama [and] given a certain kind of case, it could produce a spectacle more compelling than anything the theatres could provide&quot;. At the time, opinion of the assassination divided on political grounds: the left believed Calmette&#x27;s character assassination had driven Madam Caillaux into temporary insanity; the right believed her a cold-blooded killer who had acted to silence a critic at her husband&#x27;s request.

The president of the Republic, Raymond Poincaré, made a deposition at the trial, an unheard-of occurrence at a criminal proceeding almost anywhere, and many of the participants were among the most powerful members of French society. Heightening the drama, Henriette&#x27;s husband threatened to release affidavits that he said he had, showing that Poincaré was behind the press campaign against him.
If convicted, Madame Caillaux could have been sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labour, or death. If convicted but able to convince the jury of extenuating circumstances, she could be sentenced to five years of hard labour; or if, as happened, she could convince the jury of extremely extenuating circumstances, they could return a verdict of not guilty.

To that end, she &quot;portrayed herself as the victim of passions behind her control, as a woman rendered irresponsible by emotions more powerful than will itself&quot; and attributed her actions to &quot;uncontrollable impulses [which made] her lose control over her own actions&quot;. The defence, coupled with the emergence of sociological theories of criminology which attributed criminal action to environmental and unconscious factors and the traditional narrative of women ruled by their passions, helped her secure acquittal on 28 July 1914.

==Later life==
In the early 1930s, Caillaux was awarded a diploma of the École du Louvre for her thesis on the sculptor Jules Dalou. She published a reference book in 1935 in which she established an inventory of the work of this artist.

==Legacy==

In 1918, an American silent film, &quot;The Caillaux Case&quot;, was released by Fox Film. Directed by Richard Stanton, it featured Madlaine Traverse as Henriette Caillaux and Eugene Ormonde as Gaston Calmette. The film portrays both Henriette Caillaux and her husband as pro-German conspirators and traitors to France. Before and during World War I, Joseph Caillaux had been an advocate of peaceful compromise with Germany, and at the end of 1917 while the war was still going on, he was charged and convicted of treason. The film was not a financial success.

A 1985 made for French television film called &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Caillaux&quot; and a 1992 book titled &quot;The Trial of Madame Caillaux&quot; by American history professor Edward Berenson recount the event. In addition, Robert Delaunay used an illustration of the assassination as the basis for his 1914 painting &quot;Political Drama&quot;.

<text>Ivan Martynovich Zarutsky (&quot;Заруцкий, Иван Мартынович&quot; in Russian) (died 1614) was a Cossack leader in Russia in the early 17th century.

==Biography==
Zarutsky was born in the city of Ternopol in the 16th century, then part of Poland–Lithuania.

In 1606–1607, ataman Zarutsky and his men took part in the Bolotnikov Uprising. After Ivan Bolotnikov&#x27;s defeat on the outskirts of Moscow, Zarutsky went to Poland to take the side of &quot;tsar Dmitry&quot; (False Dmitri II) and Polish king Sigismund III Vasa. Zarutsky played an important role in creating the military for False Dmitri II and took part in all of his battles, for which he would be given the title of a &quot;boyar&quot;.

After the death of the impostor, Zarutsky married Dmitri&#x27;s widow Marina Mniszech and set the goal to install her son Ivan on the Russian throne. In January 1611, Zarutsky joined the First People&#x27;s Volunteer Army, which had been fighting with the Polish invaders in Moscow under the command of Prokopy Lyapunov. Zarutsky organized Lyapunov&#x27;s assassination and became the leader of the army; however, most of the service class people left it after that. Zarutsky was left with a scanty unit of the Cossacks, who couldn&#x27;t struggle successfully in small numbers. The leader of the Second People&#x27;s Volunteer Army, Dmitry Pozharsky, urged the people to unite and not to recognize the authority of Marina Mniszech, her son and Zarutsky.

In 1612, abandoning the siege of Moscow, Zarutsky and his cossacks, fled to Kolomna with Marina Mniszech and her son Ivan. In June 1613, Tsar Mikhail Romanov&#x27;s army confronted the plundering Zarutsky at Voronezh, forcing Zarutsky&#x27;s retreat to Astrakhan. Zarutsky instigated a reign of terror, which caused a popular uprising, forcing Zarutsky to escape in May 1614. By mid-June, Zarutsky was captured, along with Marina, and Ivan. Zarutsky was impaled in Moscow, and the four year old Ivan hanged. Marina was imprisoned in a Kolmna tower, and died soon after.

<text>The BAFTA Award for Best Film is a film award given annually by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and presented at the British Academy Film Awards. It has been given since the 1st BAFTA Awards, representing the best films of 1947, but until 1969 it was called the BAFTA Award for Best Film From Any Source. It is possible for films from any country to be nominated, although British films are also recognised in the category BAFTA Award for Best British Film and (since 1983) foreign-language films in BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. As such, there have been multiple occasions of a film being nominated in two of these categories.

There has been one tie for the Best Film Award when, in 1962, &quot;Ballad of a Soldier&quot; tied with &quot;The Hustler&quot; for Best Film From Any Source. Throughout the history of the category, the award has been given to the director(s), the producer(s) or both.
* Between 1949 and 1959, 1962–1965, 1970–1976, and in 1979; Only the film itself and not producers or directors received the award and nomination.
* Between 1960 and 1961, 1966–1969, and in 1980; Only directors received the award and nomination.
* Between 1988 and 1997; Both producers and directors received the award and nomination.
* Between 1977 and 1978, 1981–1987, and since 1998; Only producers counted as winners and nominees in this category.

In the following lists, the titles and names in bold with a gold background are the winners and recipients respectively; those not in bold are the nominees. The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which always takes place the following year.

<text>The ox tongue spear (&quot;langue de boeuf&quot; or &quot;langdebeve&quot;) was a type of broad-headed double-edged spear that was used in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. Some designs had protrusions from the middle or base of the blades, making the head similar in profile to a partisan. Primarily, it was large and heavy, used by infantry in skirmishing.

<text>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston (1 May 1857 – 5 December 1920) was an Irish writer, literary figure and translator, known as a poet but publishing over a wide range of literary and political topics. He lived at various times in Killiney in County Dublin, the German Empire, London and County Wicklow; settling finally in 1908 in Hampstead, London, where he died. His Killiney home, called Secrora, subsequently became the home of tennis player Joshua Pim.

==Early years==
Rolleston was born in Glasshouse, Shinrone, County Offaly, the son of a judge. He was educated at St Columba&#x27;s College, Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin.

==Career==
After a time in the German Empire he founded the &quot;Dublin University Review&quot; in 1885; he published &quot;Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland&quot; (1888), and a &quot;Life of Lessing&quot; (1889). As the first managing director of the Irish Industries&#x27; Society, he helped preserve from extinction many Irish handicrafts, such as lacemaking, handmade tweeds, and glassmaking. In London in the 1890s he was one of the Rhymers&#x27; Club and a founder-member of the Irish Literary Society. He was to cross paths several times, and sometimes to clash, with W. B. Yeats, who described Rolleston in his memoirs as an &quot;intimate enemy&quot;. He was also involved in Douglas Hyde&#x27;s Gaelic League. He corresponded with the American poet Walt Whitman and, while living in Germany, sought to translate Whitman&#x27;s Leaves of Grass into German and have it published there.
He also spent time as a journalist, and as a civil servant involved with agriculture.

==Family life==
He had eight children, from two marriages. His first marriage was to Edith de Burgh (1859–1896), daughter of W. de Burgh, and his second, in 1897, was to Maud Brooke, daughter of Stopford Brooke.

==Works==
Approximately 168 books are associated with Rolleston, some as writer or editor. These are the more prominent works; publication dates listed if known.

<doc id="1039516" wikidata="Q3042171" url="?curid=1039516" title="Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy">
<text>Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare form of muscular dystrophy with symptoms generally starting when an individual is 40 to 50 years old. It can be autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease or autosomal recessive. The most common inheritance of OPMD is autosomal dominant, which means only one copy of the mutated gene needs to be present in each cell. Children of an affected parent have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutant gene.

Autosomal dominant inheritance is the most common form of inheritance. Less commonly, OPMD can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that two copies of the mutated gene need to be present in each cell, both parents need to be carriers of the mutated gene and usually show no signs or symptoms. The PABPN1 mutation contains a GCG trinucleotide repeat at the 5&#x27; end of the coding region, and expansion of this repeat which then leads to autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) disease.

==Signs and symptoms==

In terms of the signs (and symptoms) of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy would be consistent with the following:
* Ptosis
* Weakness of the extraocular muscles
* Dysphagia
* Aspiration pneumonia (complication)
* Proximal limb weakness

Though the aforementioned signs/symptoms are the most common, there have been cases though rare, where the peripheral nervous system has had involvement with significant reduction of myelinated fibers 

In homozygous cases, this muscular dystrophy is severe and starts earlier in the affected individual&#x27;s life.
==Genetics==

The genetics of this type of muscular dystrophy revolve around the PABPN1 gene. This gene suffers mutations that cause the PABPN1 protein to have extra alanine (amino acids), and this manifests itself physically in the symptoms of this MD.

The expansion caused by the mutations on the PABPN1 gene ultimately interrupts the cellular mechanics of poly(A) RNA. In most cases oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is inherited via autosomal dominance.

The alleles, which are a variant form of a gene involved in this form of MD are: PABPN1, (GCG)n EXPANSION, (GCG)8-13, PABPN1, (GCG)n EXPANSION, (GCG)7 and PABPN1, GLY12ALA.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy can be done via two methods, a muscle biopsy or a blood draw with genetic testing for GCG trinucleotide expansions in the PABPN1 gene. Genetic blood testing is more common. Additionally, a distinction between OPMD and myasthenia gravis or mitochondrial myopathy must be made, in regards to the differential diagnosis of this condition.

==Treatment==
Currently, no cure or specific treatment exists to eliminate the symptoms or stop the disease progression. A consistent diet planned with the help of a dietitian along with exercises taught by a speech therapist can assist with mild symptoms of dysphagia. Surgical intervention can also help temporarily manage symptoms related to ptosis and dysphagia. Cutting one of the throat muscles internally, an operation called cricopharyngeal myotomy, can be one way to ease symptoms in more severe cases. However, for most people, the benefits from such treatments are only temporary. There is currently no treatment available to address the proximal limb weakness. Many of those affected with proximal limb weakness will eventually require assistive devices such as canes, braces, or a wheelchair. As with all surgical procedures, they come with many risk factors. As the dysphagia becomes more severe, patients become malnourished, lose significant weight, become dehydrated and suffer from repeated incidents of aspiration pneumonia. These last two are often the cause of death.

==Epidemiology==
The disease is found across 5 continents (30 countries) and is frequently seen in French Canadians, with a prevalence 1:1000. OPMD affects males and females equally, and affected individuals have been found in Europe (France), Jewish Bukharan, and Spanish Americans.

<doc id="1039519" wikidata="Q266752" url="?curid=1039519" title="Bacchus (grape)">
<text>Bacchus is a white wine grape created by viticulturalist Peter Morio at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding in the Palatinate in 1933. He crossed a Silvaner x Riesling cross with Müller-Thurgau. 

Bacchus received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1972. Its name is taken from Roman name of the Greek wine god Dionysus.

Bacchus can reach high must weights, and has no high requirement for sites it can be planted and can grow where Riesling, for example, does not ripen reliably. It ripens early, about the same time as Müller-Thurgau, and has a high productivity similar to that variety.

Bacchus wines can have powerful flavours and character, which have even been described as &quot;exuberant&quot;, but only if it is allowed to ripen fully. It is low in acidity, which does not always make it very well suited for varietal wines under typical German growing conditions. Among the new breeds, it is considered to give less elegant wines than Kerner. Therefore, Bacchus is often used for blending into Müller-Thurgau, to give the latter more flavour. Within Germany, Franconia is considered as the source of some of the more successful varietal Bacchus wines.
Bacchus is also increasingly grown in several vineyards in England. The colder climate in England means that grapes retain a higher acidity and yields are lower, giving varietal wines of (potentially) high quality, somewhat in a Sauvignon blanc-like style: English Bacchus wines often fall somewhere between the typical French and New Zealand styles of Sauvignon Blanc, although there are examples at either end of the spectrum.

German plantations peaked in the 1990 at around of which more than half were in Rheinhessen, where it was popular to use in QbA blends. In 2006 there were of Bacchus left in Germany, 2.1% of the total vineyard surface.

== Cultivation ==

Bacchus does particularly well in the UK climate and is now considered the &#x27;poster grape&#x27; for the UK wine industry. It is now also the 3rd most planted grape in the UK after Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.

== Recognition ==

In 2017 the Decanter World Wine Awards declared that a Bacchus wine from Winbirri Vineyard, Norfolk was awarded a plantinum best in show award 

== Synonyms ==

Synonyms for the Bacchus variety include Bacchus Weiss, Weisser Bacchus, Frühe Scheurebe, Geilweilerhof 33-29-133 and Gf. 33-29-133.

== Unrelated Bacchus grapes ==

The name Bacchus Black is also applied to the &quot;riparia x labrusca&quot; hybrid red variety Clinton grown in the Alps, while Bacchus noir refers to another cross involving Poulsard.

<text>The 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309th AMARG), often called The [[Aircraft boneyard|Boneyard]], is a United States Air Force aircraft and missile storage and maintenance facility in Tucson, Arizona, located on Davis–Monthan Air Force Base. The 309th AMARG was previously Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, and the Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center.

The 309th AMARG takes care of nearly 4,000 aircraft, which makes it the largest aircraft storage and preservation facility in the world. An Air Force Materiel Command unit, the group is under the command of the Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The 309th AMARG was originally meant to store excess Department of Defense and Coast Guard aircraft, but has in recent years been designated the sole repository of out-of-service aircraft from all branches of the US government. The facility has also received US-made foreign military aircraft such as the Boeing CC-137 (from RCAF for use in the E-8 JSTARS program) and the Lockheed CP-140A Arcturus (2 from RCAF). The arid climate of the region makes the 309th AMARG an ideal location for storing aircraft, as there is very little humidity in the air that would corrode metal.
Furthermore, the surface is hard so that the aircraft do not sink into the ground.

==History==
Aircraft storage at Davis-Monthan Field began when the 4105th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Aircraft Storage) was organized in 1945, to house Boeing B-29 Superfortress and Douglas C-47 Skytrain aircraft. Davis–Monthan Field was chosen because of Tucson&#x27;s low humidity, infrequent rainfall, alkaline soil, and high altitude of , reducing rust and corrosion. The hard soil makes it possible to move aircraft around without having to pave the storage areas.

In 1949, after the Air Force&#x27;s creation as a separate service, the unit was redesignated as the 3040th Aircraft Storage Depot, and later 3040 Aircraft Storage Squadron. On 1 Jun 1956, the 3040 Aircraft Storage Squadron was discontinued. In 1965, the Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center was organized and tasked with processing aircraft for all the United States armed forces, not just the Air Force. The Navy had operated its own boneyard at Naval Air Station Litchfield Park at Goodyear, Arizona, for Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard aircraft. In February 1965, some 500 aircraft were moved from Litchfield Park to Davis–Monthan. NAS Litchfield Park was finally closed in 1968.

In the 1980s, the center began processing intercontinental ballistic missiles for dismantling or reuse in satellite launches, and was renamed the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) to reflect the expanded focus on all aerospace assets.

In the 1990s, in accordance with the START I treaty, the center was tasked with eliminating 365 Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers. The progress of this task was to be verified by Russia via satellite and first-person inspection at the facility. Initially, the B-52s were chopped into pieces with a 13,000 pound guillotine winched by a steel cable supported by a crane. Later on, the tool of choice became K-12 rescue saws. This more precise technique afforded AMARC with salvageable spare parts.

In May 2007, the AMARC was transferred to the 309th Maintenance Wing, and the center was renamed the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG).

==Storage procedures==
There are four categories of storage for aircraft at AMARG:
* Long Term (Type 1000) – Aircraft are kept intact in “inviolate” storage for future use. No parts are removed without the express permission of appropriate program office.
* Parts Reclamation (Type 2000) – Aircraft are kept, picked apart and used for spare parts.
* Flying Hold (Type 3000) – Aircraft are kept intact with regular running of their engines, towing to lubricate their bearings and servicing of fluids.
* Excess of DoD needs (Type 4000) – Aircraft are sold off whole or in parts.

AMARG employs approximately 500 DoD civil servants and 200 contractors. The facility is adjacent to the base. On average, AMARG annually returns approximately $500 million worth of spare parts to military, government, and allied customers. Congressional oversight determines what equipment may be sold to which customer.

An aircraft going into storage undergoes the following treatments:
* Ejection seat charges and classified hardware are removed.
* All aircraft are carefully washed with fresh water to remove environment residue and then allowed to dry.
* The fuel system is protected by draining it, refilling it with lightweight oil, running engines to coat fuel system plumbing and engines, and then draining it again. This leaves a protective oil film.
* The aircraft is sealed from dust, sunlight, and high temperatures. This is done using a variety of materials, including a high tech vinyl plastic compound that is sprayed on the aircraft. This compound is called &quot;Spraylat&quot; after its producer the Spraylat Corporation, and is applied in two coats, a black coat that seals the aircraft and a white coat that reflects the sun and helps to keep internal temperatures low. The plane is then towed by a tug to its designated &quot;storage&quot; position.

On average the Group annually receives 300 aircraft for storage and processes out about the same number (with 50 to 100 of those returning to flying service). Aircraft that fly again either return to the U.S. military, U.S. government agencies such as the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Forest Service, and NASA, or are sold to allied governments under either the Foreign Military Sales program of the Arms Export Control Act, or the Excess Defense Articles program of the Foreign Assistance Act.

==Accessibility==
AMARG is a controlled-access site, and is off-limits to anyone not employed there without the proper clearance. From April 2013 onwards the base had hosted an annual 10K/5K run/walk which was open to the general public.

==Use in film and TV production==
AMARG has been used as a filming location in several films and television productions, despite security. The most recent and notable of these is &quot;&quot;. The exterior scenes of the Smithsonian set were actually filmed in the Boneyard.

AMARG was featured in an episode of TNT&#x27;s &quot;The Great Escape&quot;.

<doc id="1039526" wikidata="Q743756" url="?curid=1039526" title="World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters">
<text>The World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (, AMARC) is the international umbrella organization of community radio broadcasters founded in 1983, with nearly 3,000 members in 110 countries. Its mission is to support and contribute to the development of community and participatory radio along the principles of solidarity and international cooperation.

The association is a member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of non-governmental organisations that monitors free expression violations worldwide and defends journalists, writers, Internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression. It is involved in the Tunisia Monitoring Group, a coalition of 16 free expression groups that campaign to end human rights violations in Tunisia. It has also supported the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, over Israel&#x27;s policies and actions during the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Members of the association gather every 3–4 years for a general assembly. Many member stations also operate organisations at the regional or national level. For example, New Zealand community radio stations belong as stations of the Association of Community Access Broadcasters.

==Principles==

===Operational principles===
Association members are required to uphold the following principles:
* Believe in the need to democratise access to information and communication in order to promote more just relationships and equitable exchanges among peoples.
* Contribute to the expression of different social, cultural and political movements – in all their diversity – by working to promote all initiatives that encourage peace, friendship among peoples, democracy, and development.
* Recognize the fundamental and specific role of women in establishing new communication practices. Women&#x27;s participation in the decision-making structures of community radio stations is essential.

===Programming principles===
Association members are required to do the following things through their programming:
* Respect for peoples’ sovereignty and independence.
* Respect for solidarity and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.
* International cooperation based on equality, solidarity, mutual respect, and the refusal of all discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion.
* Respect for the cultural identity of all people.

==History==

===General assemblies===

The association began as a movement in 1983, during a gathering in Montreal. It became an association at its 1986 conference in Vancouver and was recognised as a non-government organisation at its 1988 conference in Managua. The 1990 conference in Dublin focused on freedom of expression, and an International Women&#x27;s Network and International Solidarity Network were launched at the 1992 conference in Oaxtepec. The independence of local members and branches was recognised in the 1995 Dakar conference, and the need to collaborate on technology and legal issues was recognised in the 1998 Milan conference.

The 2003 Kathmandu conference hosted the signing of the Kathmandu Declaration - an agreement that &quot;rampant militarism, accelerated privatization of the world&#x27;s basic resources, religious fundamentalism and extreme capitalism&quot; posted a critical threat to human rights. The declaration stated that radio was &quot;the most affordable, egalitarian and accessible communication technology&quot; in the world. It called on every government to recognize and uphold the right to freedom of expression, including the right to radio spectrum and community radio broadcasting, particularly for disadvantaged groups like women, children and disabled people.

At the 2010 general assembly in Bangalore, members committed to promoting opportunities for indigenous communities to access community broadcasting. Their declaration stated that research and documentation of traditional knowledge is important to preserving and conserving indigenous traditions, languages, cultures and the management of natural resources.

===Local activities===

By 2003, the African arm of the association was supporting the legal, political and cultural framework in which both men and woman were able and encouraged to participate in radio broadcasting. It had a regional network of broadcasters to distribute information, share experiences and transfer skills. The association was also giving members access to new technology, human resources and training programmes on broadcasting, gender issues, new technologies and communication. It was also coordinating exchanges, research, content development, new initiatives and news gathering.

The World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters was also involved in the development of community radio in other parts of the world. Between 2003 and 2008, it helped Fijian women trial &quot;radio in a suitcase&quot; using mobile facilities. Its member stations in Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand have also been recognised for giving women and minorities new opportunities to broadcast their views. The association has many member stations in Nepal, and has sought funding to restore their broadcasting infrastructure.

===International activities===

During August and September 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters hosted regional virtual consultations for the global farming community. The consultations were open to development professionals, people involved in community media, rural development agencies and private sector companies. The campaign marked the International Year of Family Farming.

Between March and December 2015, the two organisations collaborated again to produce 80 audio pieces by producers and community radio journalists to recognise the International Year of Soils. The twice-weekly series was aimed at sparking discussions and education about the environment, climate change, food security, agriculture, sustainable development, resilience, and the importance of soils.

==Lobbying==

===Radio industry lobbying===

At the 2003 ITU World Summit on the Information Society, the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters criticised the lack of representation of community-based media. It made a submission to the summit to have community radio recognised as important, and submitted that community-based radio stations should be allocated &quot;suitable frequencies, equitable access to licenses, and public financial and technological support and training&quot;.

The submission went on to argue community media are key to creating a &quot;strong, socially responsible civil society&#x27;&quot;, provided they have sufficient financial resources and can respect and preserve their independence from government and commercial media. The association said governments should reinvest their revenues from the sale of spectrum, cable and telecommunications licenses into social communication objectives, and provide tax incentives, production funds and legislative support for community radio stations.

===Political lobbying ===

In 2011, the association wrote a letter in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel. In it, the association said it boycott was in line with the front-line community access broadcasting model of its member stations. The letter said the International Middle East Media Center, a member station in Palestinian territory, was reporting on the daily life for Palestinians for many of its member stations around the world. However, the association did not claim to speak on behalf of any member stations.

In 2012, the association held the Tunisia Community-Associative Media Conference, a gathering of 60 freedom of expression activists from Tunisia, and community radio leaders from around the world. The conference focused on advocacy, content development and radio production, and ways community broadcasting to cause change in Tunisia. Its focus was on the freedom of expression of both men and women in Tunisia, as it fitted into the wider political and social context.

<text>The Sabine Pass Lighthouse, or Sabine Pass Light as it was referred to by the United States Coast Guard, is a historic lighthouse, as part of a gulf coast light station, on the Louisiana side of the Sabine River, in Cameron Parish, across from the community of Sabine Pass, Texas. It was first lit in 1857 and was deactivated by the Coast Guard in 1952. One of only three built in the United States of similar design, the light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as &quot;Sabine Pass Lighthouse&quot; on December 17, 1981. It is now abandoned but has long continued to be the subject of preservation efforts.

The Calcasieu Historical Preservation Society – with interest because the lighthouse was once in Calcasieu Parish – has listed that the lighthouse may be the oldest brick structure still standing in Southwest Louisiana.

==History==
On March 3, 1849, the United States Congress appropriated $7,500 for a lighthouse in Sabine Pass. Commander Henry A. Adams was sent to investigate a site location but reported, &quot;the coast is so free from danger in that vicinity, the place itself so easy of access, and the business done there so inconsiderable, that, in my opinion, a light-house is not necessary there at this time.&quot; Construction was delayed until further calls for a light prompted a second appropriation in 1853. Captain Danville Leadbetter (later to serve as a Confederate general), whose recommendation was instrumental in bringing about construction, also designed the station.

Construction began in 1855 under the supervision of United States Lighthouse Board (LHS) inspector Walter H. Stevens (also later to serve as a Confederate States general) and took two years. The tower was constructed of brick and was set on a shellcrete and wooden pile foundation. The marshy location led to an unusual system of buttresses radiating from the base of the tower in order to stabilize it. The white-painted tower was equipped with a third order Fresnel lens and lit for the first time in mid-1857.

The beacon was extinguished during the Civil War in 1861, to hinder navigation by Union ships, but was returned to service December 23, 1865 after the Confederate surrender. The tower was used as an observation post by both Confederate and Union soldiers, prompting a skirmish at the light on April 16, 1863; several men were killed. This was five months before the Second Battle of Sabine Pass, which was fought nearby.

The original keeper&#x27;s dwelling was destroyed by a hurricane in 1886, with the keeper and his wife surviving by holding up in the tower; a new dwelling and accessory buildings were constructed the following year. Another hurricane in 1915 shook the tower so violently that the clockwork for the beacon stopped, and the keeper rotated it by hand to keep the light active.

In the early years of the twentieth century, jetties were constructed in the vicinity of the light, and by 1921 these extended well out into the gulf, necessitating their own navigational beacons. This made the old light increasingly irrelevant, though it continued to be staffed. In 1928 a radio beacon was installed, and the following year the beacon was converted to electricity; the plumbing was upgraded in 1937. A daymark of two black stripes was painted on the tower in 1932, following a suggestion from a Texaco tanker captain, who observed that the white structure was often hard to distinguish in the haze. It was finally deactivated in 1952. The remote location of the light made it vulnerable, and it suffered from vandalism and fires which destroyed the keeper&#x27;s dwelling and outbuildings.

After years of being passed between various federal and state agencies, the surviving structure was sold at auction in 1985 to a pair of businessmen who had plans to build a marina or restaurant featuring the tower. These plans were never realized, and in 2001 they donated it to the Cameron Preservation Alliance, which has constructed a road to the abandoned and decaying tower, This preservation group has plans to make the property into a parish historical museum. Cheniere Energy has built an LNG terminal with an improved gravel road passing the plant and ending at the lighthouse property, 
which they are currently expanding with a liquefaction project on the they own.

==Current==
The Sabine Pass Lighthouse is in a severe deteriorated state with some long-term goals for restoration but funding has been a problem since Hurricane Rita as well as possible foundation damages to the lighthouse. The lighthouse isn&#x27;t forgotten. Both the Cameron Parish and Johnson Bayou libraries &quot;support the lighthouse greatly&quot;, according to Cameron Preservation Alliance President Carolyn Thibodeaux. She also stated that $3 million is needed to stabilize the lighthouse. In 2004, the association unsuccessfully tried to secure $10 million funding that would have stabilized the base and built a museum, education center, and gift shop. Thibodeaux believes there is still plenty of interest in the lighthouse. The Calcasieu Historical Preservation Society placed the lighthouse on its list of the area&#x27;s most endangered structures. Adley Cormier, a preservationist with the society stated, &quot;We need to be aware that it is a shared resource and help might come from both sides of the river.&quot; He further said: &quot;It&#x27;s part of our history, too. It&#x27;s an opportunity for all Southwest Louisiana to come together.&quot; Cormier also said he would like the structure to be thought of as Southwest Louisiana&#x27;s lighthouse, with the five-parish area, as well as Southeast Texas, chipping in; the lighthouse sits on land that was part of Calcasieu Parish when it was built. Ami Kamara, curator for the Gulf Coast Museum, stated, &quot;When you live on the Gulf, you consider the whole Gulf your home.&quot; Kamara said that lighthouses were &quot;such an important part of living on a coast and keeping it safe for the shipping industry&quot; and that East Texans still consider the lighthouse a part of their history as well.
