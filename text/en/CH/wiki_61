<text>The Estado Libre y Soberano de Nuevo León (Free and Sovereign State of [[Nuevo León]]) was first colonized in the 16th century by immigrants from the Iberian Peninsula. The majority of these were conversos, ethnic Jews converted to Roman Catholicism. Later the state received more arrivals of other Europeans, some Asians and those from North America settled down in the 19th century. Cross-migration of local Mexicans to or from Texas creates strong cultural bonds with the neighboring U.S. The province eventually became a state of Mexico. Today it is one of the most industrialized regions of Latin America and the greater city area of its capital, Monterrey has over 5 million residents.

==Origins==
The earliest known human inhabitants of the region now known as Nuevo León were a small number of Native American nomads. They left no written records, so the recorded history of the region begins with the arrival of European colonists towards the end of the 16th century. The first Europeans to explore what is now Nuevo León, were those of the expedition led by Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, they made an expedition through the Spanish Florida (La Florida) to the Pacific sea. After several failed attempts, a group of settlers, among them several families of converted Jews, arrived on the Mexican coast aboard the &quot;Santa Catarina&quot;. The Jewish imprint in this colony was mild due to acculturation of &quot;conversos&quot; to Christianity, but, through the passing of tradition, some Jewish customs are still seen today, such as food preparation and holiday observances. Led by the Portuguese Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva they settled in what is now the city of Monterrey in fulfillment of a commitment made by King Philip II of Spain: the establishment of the New Kingdom of León (&quot;Nuevo Reino de León&quot;). Carvajal and his followers, which consisted of more than sixty soldiers and outlaws, were reputed to have made a fortune capturing and selling Indian slaves.

The first years of the colony were difficult for those who were beleaguered by the Spanish Inquisition, indigenous tribes, and by several floods. The previous settlement founded by Carvajal remained sparsely inhabited and was eventually depopulated. The definitive foundation of Monterrey occurred on September 20, 1596, when Spanish captain Diego de Montemayor, founded the city of Our Lady of Monterrey, &quot;Along with a great mountain and the Santa Lucia water springs&quot;, which had been the name of the village previously founded by Carvajal.

==New Kingdom of León==
From the outset, the greater portion of the population remained concentrated in what was to be formally designated in 1596 as the city of Monterrey. However, arrival of settlers from all over Spain were present in upcoming years. As the case of Bernabé de las Casas, a Spanish-Canarian explorer from Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, who after his victorious expedition with Juan de Oñate and fighting against Acoma Indians in New Mexico, came to the region with Spanish and Canarians families to found several settlements and mining camps in a then unsettled region of the New Kingdom of León, later known as Valle de las Salinas (Salinas Valley), in the subsequent years many villages were founded by his descendants, and the Salinas Valley was declared an &#x27;alcaldía mayor&#x27;.

The establishment of Spanish settlements in Northern Nuevo León, was often slowed down by attacks of Native Americans, of Coahuiltecan origin such as Alazapas, Cuanales, and Gualeguas, among others. The attacks were prompted by, or in response to, Spanish slave raids on the Indians. Spanish Captain Alonso de León wrote a description of many assaults and atrocities against the Spaniards in the New Kingdom of León, he also stated that the indigenous population of the New Kingdom of León, was different in all aspects from that of other provinces of New Spain.

Mestizaje, a characteristic of many provinces in New Spain, was difficult on this province, the natives resisted to accept Christianity imposed by Spaniards, and they did not want to be incorporated into Spanish / Criollo society. This feeling of racial segregation was reciprocated among many Spanish and Spanish-born Reineros of the New Kingdom of León towards the indigenous people, who were frequently at war with them, the indigenous population had no permanent establishment.

Instead, several nomadic tribes whose main activity was war and hunting, those skirmish were a major problem among the Spanish population. By the end of the Spanish rule, the white population of the New Kingdom of León comprised approximately 80% of the population. By the end of the colonial era, the (as they were known) had obtained a certain stability and had established the city of Linares, considered the second largest city, located southeast of Monterrey.

==Insurgent era==
News about the insurgent movement started by Miguel Hidalgo on 16 September 1810, was virtually nonexistent to the inhabitants of the New Kingdom of León, until a letter sent by Felix María Calleja to then New Leon governor Manuel de Santa María on 29 September. The distance and poor condition of access routes were a factor for the delayed post service, from the capital of New Spain to the relatively remote northern provinces. The impulse toward insurgency against Spain was rapidly suffocated in the region. The New Kingdom of León, along with Provincias Internas de Oriente, was in its first years one of the regions with relatively less support for the insurgent cause. As for the New Kingdom of León, among several explanations for this fact was that it was one of the last territories colonized by the Spanish Empire in New Spain. Also, it was the province which reported the highest proportion of people of Spanish and Criollo ancestry, as reported in the &quot;revillagigedo&quot; 1790 census, followed by Texas and Coahuila.

The ideology or ideals which Miguel Hidalgo fought were at his first attempt not well received in the Provincias Internas de Oriente, because of stronger ties with Spain and loyalism to Fernando VI, and counter-insurgency movements were present on the region, mainly in the first years of the war, with the movement of a former insurgent general Ignacio Elizondo, who changed to the army of loyalists of Fernando VI, the reasons are controversially disputed, but its understood that he was a loyalist when he joined the insurgent side, and its convictions were stronger when he was influenced and persuaded by general Ramón Díaz de Bustamante to organize a plot to caught major insurgency precursors such as Miguel Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende, and Mariano Abasolo, whom Ignacio Elizondo, caught at Bajan, Coahuila, in 1811, while they were fleeing northward toward Monclova, ultimately hoping to reach sanctuary in the United States.
In the later years of the war, movement toward insurgency were less frequent and the independence sentiment was reasserted but there was some discomfort about the situation because of a general displeasure with the news that José María Morelos, one of the leaders of the movement, had convoked a constituent congress in Chilpancingo, in the south of Mexico, and had named himself representative of the Nuevo Reino de León, although he had absolutely no prior connection to the region. Just one year before Juan José de la Garza had represented the Nuevo Reino de León in the Cortes Generales at Cádiz, which had produced the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812.
After Mexican independence was achieved, Fray Servando Teresa de Mier (a rather unorthodox priest who claimed that the Virgin of Guadalupe had been engraved not on the &quot;tilma&quot; of Juan Diego but on the mantle of Saint Thomas) represented Nuevo Reino de León at the national constituent congress. In its decree number 45, article 1, the congress pronounced that &quot;Nuevo León will be from this time forward a state of the Mexican Federation&quot;.

Father Mier organized the establishment of a local legislature, which adopted the first constitution of the newly established state 5 March 1825. This state congress was dissolved in 1835 and the state was converted into a &quot;Department&quot;. The national struggle between conservatives and liberals damaged the region&#x27;s stability. In 1846, during the Mexican–American War, United States forces besieged Monterrey (&quot;see Battle of Monterrey&quot;). Additionally, native tribes originating in the U.S. made a brutal assault on the region, stealing women, children, cattle, and provisions. The chaos was such that it became routine to draw up ones will before making even a short journey.

==Separatist attempts==

By the middle of the 19th century the inhabitants of Nuevo León began to take reprisals against the indigenous natives, the U.S., and the Mexican authorities. In 1850 towns throughout Nuevo León were ready with an armed militia and with combat provisions (&quot;bastimento&quot;) already prepared for a combat that could break out at any moment. The &quot;bastimento&quot; consisted of corn biscuits, dried meat, and chocolate, the cornerstones of the rural diet of Nuevo León then and now.

The response to the native invasions was ruthless. Influenced by the methods of the Americans to their north, the Nuevoleonese poisoned the waters from which the natives drank and put a bounty on natives&#x27; scalps. The combat with the Apaches, Comanches, runaway Kickapoos and North American filibusterers, while brutal and inhuman, gave a great deal of experience to the Nuevoleonese militias, who defeated the Mexican Army in several battles. The combat skills of local heroes Juan Zuazua, José Silvestre Aramberri, Mariano Escobedo, Lázaro Garza Ayala and Jerónimo Treviño were all tempered by those skirmishes.

The leader of this self-defense movement was Santiago Vidaurri, who proclaimed the &quot;Plan de Monterrey&quot; in 1855, restoring the sovereignty of Nuevo León. Later a sympathizer with the Confederacy in the American Civil War, Vidaurri democratically annexed the Mexican state of Coahuila by plebiscite and later declared the República de la Sierra Madre, one of Nuevo León&#x27;s two famous attempts at separatism (the other being the Republic of the Rio Grande in 1840). Upon the death of his chief military supporter, general Juan Zuazua, he was easily taken prisoner by other Nuevoleonese loyal to Benito Juárez, who decreed the deannexation of Coahuila.

==Later history==
At the end of the 19th century, several industries grew up in Nuevo León that, over the course of time, would come to dominate the Mexican economy. This was the period in which the first Nuevoleonese banks arose, as well as breweries, cementer manufacturers, steel mills. Toward the middle of the 20th century, Nuevo León had two internationally famous educational institutions: the Autonomous University of Nuevo León and the Technological Institute of Higher Studies in Monterrey (&quot;Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey&quot;). The state received a heavy flow of German, Russian and Italian immigration, thus enriched the local Mexican culture and closened ties with Texas of the United States.

In the 1970s some terrorist groups espousing communist ideology and identified with the social problems of southeastern Mexico plagued Nuevo León with assassinations of important businessmen, among them Eugenio Garza Sada. Economic crises struck the state like everywhere in Mexico, but again came remarkable economic growth in the 1990s brought on by North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA has improved living conditions.

, Nuevo León leads Mexico in most indexes of health and quality of life. Municipalities such as San Pedro Garza García have the highest standard of living in Latin America, and Nuevo León as a whole has a human development index superior to some European countries; compared against countries, it would occupy position #32 in the world.

<text>Mount Charles Stewart is a mountain located in the Bow River valley of Banff National Park in Canada.

The mountain was named in 1928 after Charles Stewart, who served as Premier of Alberta from 1917 to 1921.

==Geology==

Mount Charles Stewart is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==

Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Charles Stewart is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 C with wind chill factors below −30 C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Charles Stewart drains into the Bow River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

<doc id="1028836" wikidata="Q15098397" url="?curid=1028836" title="Root nodule">
<text>Root nodules are found on the roots of plants, primarily legumes, that form a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific strain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times within the legumes, as well as in other species found within the Rosid clade. Legume crops include beans, peas, and soybeans.

Within legume root nodules, nitrogen gas (N2) from the atmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH3), which is then assimilated into amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA and RNA as well as the important energy molecule ATP), and other cellular constituents such as vitamins, flavones, and hormones. Their ability to fix gaseous nitrogen makes legumes an ideal agricultural organism as their requirement for nitrogen fertilizer is reduced. Indeed, high nitrogen content blocks nodule development as there is no benefit for the plant of forming the symbiosis. The energy for splitting the nitrogen gas in the nodule comes from sugar that is translocated from the leaf (a product of photosynthesis). Malate as a breakdown product of sucrose is the direct carbon source for the bacteroid. Nitrogen fixation in the nodule is very oxygen sensitive. Legume nodules harbor an iron containing protein called leghaemoglobin, closely related to animal myoglobin, to facilitate the diffusion of oxygen gas used in respiration.

==Symbiosis==
===Leguminous family===
Plants that contribute to N2 fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae – with taxa such as kudzu, clovers, soybeans, alfalfa, lupines, peanuts, and rooibos. They contain symbiotic bacteria called rhizobia within the nodules, producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants. When the plant dies, the fixed nitrogen is released, making it available to other plants, and this helps to fertilize the soil. The great majority of legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., &quot;Styphnolobium&quot;) do not. In many traditional farming practices, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually includes one consisting mainly or entirely of a leguminous crop such as clover, in order to take advantage of this.

===Non-leguminous===
Although by far the majority of plants able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules are in the legume family Fabaceae, there are a few exceptions:

* Actinorhizal plants such as alder and bayberry can form (less complex) nitrogen-fixing nodules, thanks to a symbiotic association with &quot;Frankia&quot; bacteria. These plants belong to 25 genera distributed among 8 plant families. According to a count in 1998, it includes about 200 species and accounts for roughly the same amount of nitrogen fixation as rhizobial symbioses. An important structural difference is that in these symbioses the bacteria are never released from the infection thread.
* &quot;Parasponia&quot;, a tropical genus in the Cannabaceae is also able to interact with rhizobia and form nitrogen-fixing nodules. As related plants are actinorhizal, it is believed that the plant &quot;switched partner&quot; in its evolution.

The ability to fix nitrogen is far from universally present in these families. For instance, of 122 genera in the Rosaceae, only 4 genera are capable of fixing nitrogen. All these families belong to the orders Cucurbitales, Fagales, and Rosales, which together with the Fabales form a &quot;nitrogen-fixing clade&quot; (NFC) of eurosids. In this clade, Fabales were the first lineage to branch off; thus, the ability to fix nitrogen may be plesiomorphic and subsequently lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant; however, it may be that the basic genetic and physiological requirements were present in an incipient state in the last common ancestors of all these plants, but only evolved to full function in some of them:


==Classification==

Two main types of nodule have been described in legumes: determinate and indeterminate.

Determinate nodules are found on certain tribes of tropical legume such as those of the genera &quot;Glycine&quot; (soybean), &quot;Phaseolus&quot; (common bean), and &quot;Vigna&quot;. and on some temperate legumes such as &quot;Lotus&quot;. These determinate nodules lose meristematic activity shortly after initiation, thus growth is due to cell expansion resulting in mature nodules which are spherical in shape. Another type of determinate nodule is found in a wide range of herbs, shrubs and trees, such as &quot;Arachis&quot; (peanut). These are always associated with the axils of lateral or adventitious roots and are formed following infection via cracks where these roots emerge and not using root hairs. Their internal structure is quite different from those of the soybean type of nodule.

Indeterminate nodules are found in the majority of legumes from all three sub-families, whether in temperate regions or in the tropics. They can be seen in &quot;Faboideae&quot; legumes such as &quot;Pisum&quot; (pea), &quot;Medicago&quot; (alfalfa), &quot;Trifolium&quot; (clover), and &quot;Vicia&quot; (vetch) and all mimosoid legumes such as &quot;acacia&quot;s, the few nodulated &quot;caesalpinioid&quot; legumes such as partridge pea. They earned the name &quot;indeterminate&quot; because they maintain an active apical meristem that produces new cells for growth over the life of the nodule. This results in the nodule having a generally cylindrical shape, which may be extensively branched. Because they are actively growing, indeterminate nodules manifest zones which demarcate different stages of development/symbiosis:

*Zone I—the active meristem. This is where new nodule tissue is formed which will later differentiate into the other zones of the nodule.
*Zone II—the infection zone. This zone is permeated with infection threads full of bacteria. The plant cells are larger than in the previous zone and cell division is halted.
**Interzone II–III—Here the bacteria have entered the plant cells, which contain amyloplasts. They elongate and begin terminally differentiating into symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacteroids.
*Zone III—the nitrogen fixation zone. Each cell in this zone contains a large, central vacuole and the cytoplasm is filled with fully differentiated bacteroids which are actively fixing nitrogen. The plant provides these cells with leghemoglobin, resulting in a distinct pink color.
*Zone IV—the senescent zone. Here plant cells and their bacteroid contents are being degraded. The breakdown of the heme component of leghemoglobin results in a visible greening at the base of the nodule.

This is the most widely studied type of nodule, but the details are quite different in nodules of peanut and relatives and some other important crops such as lupins where the nodule is formed following direct infection of rhizobia through the epidermis and where infection threads are never formed. Nodules grow around the root, forming a collar-like structure. In these nodules and in the peanut type the central infected tissue is uniform, lacking the uninfected ells seen in nodules of soybean and many indeterminate types such as peas and clovers.
Actinorhizal-type nodules are markedly different structures found in non-legumes. In this type, cells derived from the root cortex form the infected tissue, and the prenodule becomes part of the mature nodule. Despite this seemingly major difference, it is possible to produce such nodules in legumes by a single homeotic mutation.

==Nodulation==
Legumes release organic compounds as secondary metabolites called flavonoids from their roots, which attract the rhizobia to them and which also activate &quot;nod&quot; genes in the bacteria to produce nod factors and initiate nodule formation. These &quot;nod&quot; factors initiate root hair curling. The curling begins with the very tip of the root hair curling around the &quot;Rhizobium&quot;. Within the root tip, a small tube called the infection thread forms, which provides a pathway for the &quot;Rhizobium&quot; to travel into the root epidermal cells as the root hair continues to curl.

Partial curling can even be achieved by &quot;nod&quot; factor alone. This was demonstrated by the isolation of &quot;nod&quot; factors and their application to parts of the root hair. The root hairs curled in the direction of the application, demonstrating the action of a root hair attempting to curl around a bacterium. Even application on lateral roots caused curling. This demonstrated that it is the &quot;nod&quot; factor itself, not the bacterium that causes the stimulation of the curling.

When the nod factor is sensed by the root, a number of biochemical and morphological changes happen: cell division is triggered in the root to create the nodule, and the root hair growth is redirected to curl around the bacteria multiple times until it fully encapsulates one or more bacteria. The bacteria encapsulated divide multiple times, forming a microcolony. From this microcolony, the bacteria enter the developing nodule through the infection thread, which grows through the root hair into the basal part of the epidermis cell, and onwards into the root cortex; they are then surrounded by a plant-derived symbiosome membrane and differentiate into bacteroids that fix nitrogen.

Effective nodulation takes place approximately four weeks after crop planting, with the size, and shape of the nodules dependent on the crop. Crops such as soybeans, or peanuts will have larger nodules than forage legumes such as red clover, or alfalfa, since their nitrogen needs are higher. The number of nodules, and their internal color, will indicate the status of nitrogen fixation in the plant.

Nodulation is controlled by a variety of processes, both external (heat, acidic soils, drought, nitrate) and internal (autoregulation of nodulation, ethylene). Autoregulation of nodulation controls nodule numbers per plant through a systemic process involving the leaf. Leaf tissue senses the early nodulation events in the root through an unknown chemical signal, then restricts further nodule development in newly developing root tissue. The Leucine rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinases (NARK in soybean (&quot;Glycine max&quot;); HAR1 in &quot;Lotus japonicus&quot;, SUNN in &quot;Medicago truncatula&quot;) are essential for autoregulation of nodulation (AON). Mutation leading to loss of function in these AON receptor kinases leads to supernodulation or hypernodulation. Often root growth abnormalities accompany the loss of AON receptor kinase activity, suggesting that nodule growth and root development are functionally linked. Investigations into the mechanisms of nodule formation showed that the ENOD40 gene, coding for a 12–13 amino acid protein [41], is up-regulated during nodule formation [3].

== Connection to root structure ==
Root nodules apparently have evolved three times within the Fabaceae but are rare outside that family. The propensity of these plants to develop root nodules seems to relate to their root structure. In particular, a tendency to develop lateral roots in response to abscisic acid may enable the later evolution of root nodules.

==Nodule-like structures==
Some fungi produce nodular structures known as tuberculate ectomycorrhizae on the roots of their plant hosts. &quot;Suillus tomentosus&quot;, for example, produces these structures with its plant host lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot; var. &quot;latifolia&quot;). These structures have, in turn, been shown to host nitrogen fixing bacteria, which contribute a significant amount of nitrogen and allow the pines to colonize nutrient-poor sites.

<doc id="1028837" wikidata="Q461641" url="?curid=1028837" title="Carrie Meek">
<text>Carrie Mae Meek (née Pittman; April 29, 1926November 28, 2021) was the United States representative for Florida&#x27;s 17th congressional district, from 1993 to 2003. Having been elected in the September 1992 primary with no general election opponent, she was the first African American since the Reconstruction era elected to represent Florida in the United States Congress, where she advocated for the poor and for members of minority groups. An educator, legislator, stateswoman and a member of the Democratic Party, she served from 1979 to 1982 in the Florida House of Representatives, from 1982 to 1992 in the Florida Senate, and from 1993 to 2003, as a congresswoman in the United States House of Representatives. She was the founder of the Carrie Meek Foundation.

== Early life and education ==
Carrie Mae Pittman was born on April 29, 1926, in Tallahassee, Florida, where she was raised, the youngest of 12 children of Willie and Carrie Pittman. She was the daughter of sharecroppers and granddaughter of a slave.

Meek was a graduate of Lincoln High School. She remained in north Florida for college and was graduated from Florida A&amp;M University (a historically black university then known as Florida A&amp;M College for Negroes) in 1946. Her degree was in physical education and biology, and she also lettered in track and field. At that time, African Americans were not allowed to be admitted to graduate schools in Florida, so Meek enrolled in the University of Michigan and received her master of science degree in 1948.

== Academic career ==
After graduation from the University of Michigan, Meek was hired as a teacher at Bethune-Cookman College, another historically black college in Daytona Beach, Florida. Following that, she taught at her alma mater, Florida A&amp;M University. Meek moved to Miami in 1961 to serve as special assistant to the vice president of Miami-Dade Community College. Largely due to Meek&#x27;s integral role in the administration of the college during the push for its integration, the college was desegregated in 1963.

Throughout her years as an educator, Meek was also active in community projects in the Miami area.

== Political career ==
=== Florida Legislature ===
When state representative Gwen Cherry, Florida&#x27;s first woman African American legislator, died in a car crash in 1979, Meek decided to run in the special election to succeed her. She was elected to the Florida House as a Democrat. As a state representative, she introduced a bill criminalizing stalking. She served until 1982.

In 1982, Meek ran for a newly drawn state senate seat based in northern Dade County. She became the first African American woman elected to the Florida Senate. As a state senator, Meek served on the education appropriations subcommittee. Her efforts in the legislature led to the construction of thousands of affordable rental housing units.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
In 1992, a court-ordered congressional redistricting plan drew three districts with a substantial African American population that were designed to elect black candidates of choice to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act. Meek ran for one of those seats, the 17th district, which was based in northern Dade County. Along with Corrine Brown and Alcee Hastings, Meek became the first black member of Congress from Florida since Post-Civil War Reconstruction Era.

Upon taking office, Meek faced the task of helping her district recover from Hurricane Andrew&#x27;s devastation. Her efforts as the only freshman Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee helped to provide $100 million in federal assistance to rebuild Dade County. Also while in the House, Meek successfully focused her attention on issues such as economic development, health care, education, and housing. She led legislation through Congress to improve Dade County&#x27;s transit system, airport, and seaport; to construct a new family and childcare center in northern Dade County; and to fund advanced aviation training programs at Miami-Dade Community College. Meek emerged as a strong advocate for Haitian immigrants and senior citizens.

Meek believed that her district was undercounted in the 1990 Census and that the votes of her constituents were not represented correctly in the 2000 presidential election. Meek and other members of the U.S. House of Representatives objected to the 25 electoral votes from Florida that George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount. Because no U.S. senator joined her objection, it had to be dismissed during the certification of the votes of the Electoral College by Vice President Al Gore while he was overseeing the recount that was his vice presidential role in the senate. Gore had been Bush&#x27;s opponent in the race.

Meek never lost a race for reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives. She announced that she would not seek re-election in the 2002 election, and retired from the House at the end of her term in January 2003. Her son, Kendrick Meek, ran for her vacated seat and succeeded her.

== Personal life ==

Meek was married twice. Her husbands were Lucius Davis and Harold Meek. Both marriages ended in divorce. She had three children, two daughters, and a son, Kendrick Meek.

Renown for liberal opinions, folksy yet powerful oratory, and colorful Republican bashing, once while discussing why she was a Democrat, she said, &quot;The last Republican that did something for me was Abraham Lincoln&quot;.

After her retirement from politics, she spent much of her time running the Carrie Meek Foundation, which she had founded in 2001 to provide resources and opportunities for those living in her Miami-Dade community. She stepped down for health reasons in 2015.

She died at her home in Miami on November 28, 2021, at the age of 95.

== Awards and honors ==
The Carrie Meek – James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum in Tallahassee, Florida, on the campus of Florida A&amp;M University, was co-named in Meek&#x27;s honor.

She was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and an honorary member of Iota Phi Lambda sorority.

Meek was also awarded honorary degrees by a number of institutions, including Florida A&amp;M University, University of Miami, Barry University, Florida Atlantic University, and Rollins College.

== Electoral history ==

Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1992, write-ins received 15 votes. In 1994, write-ins received 11 votes. In 1996, write-ins received two votes. In 1998, the election was uncontested with no write-ins, so Meek&#x27;s vote total was not recorded. In 2000, write-ins received three votes.

<doc id="1028841" wikidata="Q10906333" url="?curid=1028841" title="Simplex category">
<text>In mathematics, the simplex category (or simplicial category or nonempty finite ordinal category) is the category of non-empty finite ordinals and order-preserving maps. It is used to define simplicial and cosimplicial objects.

==Formal definition==

The simplex category is usually denoted by formula_1. There are several equivalent descriptions of this category. formula_1 can be described as the category of &quot;non-empty finite ordinals&quot; as objects, thought of as totally ordered sets, and &quot;(non-strictly) order-preserving functions&quot; as morphisms. The objects are commonly denoted formula_3 (so that formula_4 is the ordinal formula_5). The category is generated by coface and codegeneracy maps, which amount to inserting or deleting elements of the orderings. (See simplicial set for relations of these maps.)

A simplicial object is a presheaf on formula_1, that is a contravariant functor from formula_1 to another category. For instance, simplicial sets are contravariant with the codomain category being the category of sets. A cosimplicial object is defined similarly as a covariant functor originating from formula_1.

==Augmented simplex category==
The augmented simplex category, denoted by formula_9 is the category of &quot;all finite ordinals and order-preserving maps&quot;, thus formula_10, where formula_11. Accordingly, this category might also be denoted FinOrd. The augmented simplex category is occasionally referred to as algebraists&#x27; simplex category and the above version is called topologists&#x27; simplex category.

A contravariant functor defined on formula_9 is called an augmented simplicial object and a covariant functor out of formula_9 is called an augmented cosimplicial object; when the codomain category is the category of sets, for example, these are called augmented simplicial sets and augmented cosimplicial sets respectively.

The augmented simplex category, unlike the simplex category, admits a natural monoidal structure. The monoidal product is given by concatenation of linear orders, and the unit is the empty ordinal formula_14 (the lack of a unit prevents this from qualifying as a monoidal structure on formula_1). In fact, formula_9 is the monoidal category freely generated by a single monoid object, given by formula_17 with the unique possible unit and multiplication. This description is useful for understanding how any comonoid object in a monoidal category gives rise to a simplicial object since it can then be viewed as the image of a functor from formula_18 to the monoidal category containing the comonoid; by forgetting the augmentation we obtain a simplicial object. Similarly, this also illuminates the construction of simplicial objects from monads (and hence adjoint functors) since monads can be viewed as monoid objects in endofunctor categories.

<text>The Advanced Soaring Concepts Apex was a remotely piloted sailplane designed to take part in a NASA study of high-altitude aerodynamics.

It was planned to lift the aircraft to around 100,000 ft (30,487 m) by balloon and release it there.

Rockets would assist the aircraft to transition to horizontal flight. The Apex&#x27;s wing was designed by Dr Mark Drela of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and mounted a &quot;wake rake&quot; containing sensors to measure drag behind the wing.

Flights were originally scheduled for 1998, but the program fell behind schedule.

In January 1999, the aircraft was reportedly under construction and would be delivered to the Dryden Flight Research Center for flights beginning in March or early April. By that time, however, the project had been mothballed.

It was revived briefly one year later, before being cancelled altogether.

<text>Princess Margaret Mountain is a mountain located in the Bow River valley of Banff National Park, west of Mount Charles Stewart.

The mountain was named in 1958 after Princess Margaret (sister of Queen Elizabeth II), who had visited Banff and spent a night in a location near the mountain.

==Geology==
The mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, it is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures in winter can drop below with wind chill factors below . Weather conditions during summer months are optimum for climbing.

<doc id="1028849" wikidata="Q264475" url="?curid=1028849" title="Dieter Schnebel">
<text>Dieter Schnebel (14 March 1930 – 20 May 2018) was a German composer, theologian and musicologist. He composed orchestral music, chamber music, vocal music and stage works. From 1976 until his retirement in 1995, Schnebel served as professor of experimental music at the Hochschule der Künste, Berlin.

==Career==
Schnebel was born in Lahr/Baden. He began general private music studies with Wilhelm Siebler from 1942 until 1945, when he started piano lessons with Wilhelm Resch, and continued study with him until 1949 at the age of 19. He continued with music history through 1952, under Eric Doflein. Simultaneously he began to study composition, from 1950, with Ernst Krenek, Theodor W. Adorno and Pierre Boulez, among others. He entered formal studies at the University of Tübingen where he took musicology with Walter Gerstenberg, as well as theology, philosophy and further piano studies. In 1955, he left with a degree in theology, but with a dissertation about Arnold Schoenberg. Soon after, he married Camilla Riegger in 1956, and the couple had a son and daughter. Schnebel became a minister, and taught theology and religion until 1963 when he began teaching philosophy and psychology. After his first wife died, he underwent a period of psychoanalysis. In 1970 he married translator Iris von Kaschnitz (1928–2014), daughter of Marie Luise Kaschnitz, and began teaching religious studies and music in Munich, which he continued until 1976. His students included Australian composer Norma Tyer. In 1976, he began teaching in Berlin as a professor of experimental music and music research, a chair created for him. He held it until his retirement in 1995.

Invited by Walter Fink, he was the sixth composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1996, where his &quot;Schau-Stücke&quot; for voices and gestures premiered.

Schnebel died of a heart ailment in Berlin on 20 May 2018 at the age of 88. His and his wife&#x27;s grave is in Dahlem Cemetery.

== Cycles and style ==
Schnebel composed several cycles of works, sometimes over a long time. One of them was called &quot;Versuche&quot; (Essays), consisting of four works written 1953 to 1956. They concern serial techniques, exploring space by placing performers at separate positions. His religious music includes a cycle &quot;Für Stimmen (...missa est)&quot; (For voices ...), consisting of four works written 1956 to 1969). They use the human voice and organ in experimental settings of prayers and biblical texts. A cycle &quot;Produktionsprozesse&quot; is a group of compositions related to &quot;language and body&quot; which concerns the physical sound production, with the performers utilizing speech and breathing organs in unusual ways.

His earliest works were strongly influenced by his fellow Darmstadt students Karlheinz Stockhausen, about whose early works he wrote an extended essay, and Mauricio Kagel, about whom he edited a book. Starting in 1959, he also came under the influence of John Cage.)

Schnebel made arrangements of works by Bach, Beethoven, Webern and Wagner, called &quot;Re-Visions&quot;, sometimes using their traditional concepts to reflect new techniques and different ways of looking at them.
== Awards ==
Schnebel&#x27;s awards include the Arts Prize of Lahr in 1991. He received the first European Church Music Prize in Schwäbisch Gmünd the same year. He was a member of the Berlin Akademie der Künste from 1991, and of the Bayerische Akademie der Schönen Künste since 1996. In 2015, he was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz am Bande.

<text>The Contax i4R is a digital camera manufactured by Kyocera. The i4R was announced on 28 September 2004. Its design was one of the more unusual of Contax&#x27;s designs. Kyocera released it to the public in November, 2004 with a price of 299 GBP. The i4R features a Carl Zeiss Tessar T* 6.5mm f/2.8 lens. Its image pickup device is a charge-coupled device with 4.19 × 106 gross pixels. The i4R is PictBridge-compliant. Besides its usually small size for the time, its other unusual feature was its ability to focus down to about two inches (five centimetres).

Kyocera announced its plans to discontinue the Contax brand in April 2005, and exited all camera activity in September 2005.

<doc id="1028852" wikidata="Q5331113" url="?curid=1028852" title="Easy Company (comics)">
<text>Easy Company is a fictional comic book World War II US Army infantry unit led by Sgt. Rock in stories published by DC Comics. The group first appeared in &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #81 (April 1959), and were created by Bob Haney and Ross Andru.

==Publication history==

In the stories, the unit saw action in every combat zone in the European Theatre. Unlike actual units, the unit has at least one African-American member, which was in defiance of racial segregation policy of the Army at the time.

In the graphic novel &quot;Between Hell and a Hard Place&quot;, Sgt. Rock explained that he gave nicknames to Easy Company men because during battle, they would be required to do things their civilian identities might not be able to live with; once the war was over, the nicknames could be left behind once the soldiers resumed their civilian lives. This accounts for the proliferation of unusual character names in Easy Company over the years.

The characters of Sergeant Rock and Easy Company appeared in new monthly stories published in &quot;Our Army at War&quot; (title changed to &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; in March 1977) until &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #422 (July 1988). While no longer appearing in a monthly book, Easy Company appear from time to time in World War II stories in other DC publications, including comic book miniseries &quot;Between Hell and a Hard Place&quot; (2003), &quot;The Prophecy&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; (2008–2009).

==&quot;The Combat-Happy Joes&quot;==
Core members of Easy Company included:
* The Skipper - Easy was always commanded by an officer, usually referred to by Rock as &quot;the skipper&quot; and holding the rank of captain or lieutenant. At least one company commander, a &quot;retread&quot;, was shown in the rank of major.
* Sergeant Frank Rock - The &quot;topkick&quot; or senior NCO of &quot;Easy Company&quot;, with the Rank of &quot;Master Sergeant&quot;. Rock was a steelworker from Pennsylvania who enlisted in the U.S. Army the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was later promoted to sergeant after the Battle of Three Stripe Hill, in which he held off a German attack single-handed after they killed everyone else in his unit, earning him the nickname &quot;the Rock of Easy Company&quot;. He was usually depicted carrying a belt of .50-caliber bullets over his shoulders despite the company&#x27;s lack of heavy machine guns. Rock supposedly died &quot;from the last bullet fired in the last battle on the last day&quot; of World War II, but retconned continuities have him survive the war to later become a General.
* Bulldozer - Rock&#x27;s second-in-command, holding the rank of Corporal. He is notably large and strong man. Real name: Horace Eustace Canfield, Bulldozer is usually seen using a machinegun or an automatic rifle. Note: an earlier character named Sergeant Nichols first had the nickname &quot;Bulldozer&quot;.
* Wildman - A history professor from Colorado before the war, noted for his bright red full beard. His nickname derives from turning into a &quot;Wildman&quot; when engaged in battle. His real name is Harold Shapiro, though some sources list his first name as Joseph.
* Jackie Johnson - An African-American trooper and ex-heavyweight boxing champion, whose character was an amalgamation of Jackie Robinson and Joe Louis. He is notable as one of the first non-stereotypical African-American characters in comics.
* Little Sure Shot - An Apache sniper who always decorates his helmet with feathers. Real name: Louis Kiyahani.
* Ice Cream Soldier - A small soldier whose nickname derives in part from being at his best in combat during cold weather, and in always being &quot;cool in combat&quot;. Real name: Phil Mason. In stories post-2000, his nickname is further shortened to &quot;Ice&quot;.
* Four Eyes - A bespectacled soldier and, ironically, one of Easy&#x27;s best sharpshooters.
* Zack Nolan - Easy&#x27;s original bazooka man. He lost one arm in combat, but returned for a final mission. Some sources list his surname as Taylor.
* Long Round and Short Round - Zack&#x27;s replacements on the bazooka, always working as a team.
* Canary - A soldier known for always whistling in any circumstances not requiring silence.
* Worry Wart - A solid soldier, constantly worrying about whether his number was almost up.
* Farmer Boy - He refused to let the war stop him from doing what he was born to do.
* Junior - He lied about his age to enlist in the Army. Real name: William West.
* Sunny - He earned the nickname &quot;Sunny&quot; because he was always smiling. Real name: Samuel S. Gordon.
* Tag-a-Long - He got the nickname &quot;Tag-a-Long&quot; due to his shadowing Sgt. Rock&#x27;s every move, including following Rock into dangerous solo missions. Real name: Thomas.
* Wee Willie - He was called Wee Willie because of his small size.
* Tin Soldier - He was an actor who became a soldier. Real name: Randy Booth.

This does not include anonymous replacements and one-time characters who are frequently killed off in the stories. Easy Company&#x27;s lieutenants, when they appear at all, are frequently killed off within the first few pages. Letters columns in the 1980s included a roster of all characters introduced into the series; several dozen character names were listed, including some anonymous soldiers.

==In other media==
* The Easy Company appear in the &quot;Justice League&quot; three-part episode &quot;The Savage Time&quot;, consisting of Sgt. Rock (voiced by Fred Dryer), Bulldozer (voiced by Ted Levine), Wildman, and Ice Cream Soldier. Additionally, they are briefly joined by a temporarily depowered, time-traveling Green Lantern. The Easy Company join forces with the U.S. Armed Forces, Steve Trevor, the Blackhawks, and the time-traveling Justice League to foil Vandal Savage&#x27;s plot to help Nazi Germany win World War II and eventually conquer the world.
* The Easy Company appear in flashbacks in the &quot;Creature Commandos&quot; episode &quot;Cheers to the Tin Man&quot;, consisting of Sgt. Rock (voiced by Maury Sterling), Little Sure Shot (Robbie Daymond), Bulldozer (Paul Ben-Victor), G.I. Robot (Sean Gunn), Wildman, Four Eyes, and Canary.

<text>Sir George Eulas Foster, PC(UK)(September 3, 1847 – December 30, 1931) was a Canadian politician and academic.

Foster was a Member of Parliament (MP) and a Senator in the Canadian Parliament for a total of 45 years, 5 months and 24 days. He enjoys the unique distinction of having served in the cabinets of seven Canadian Prime Ministers: Macdonald, Abbott, Thompson, Bowell, Tupper, Borden and Meighen.

He coined the phrase &quot;splendid isolation&quot; to praise British foreign policy in the late 19th century.
Two factors thwarted whatever ambitions he may have had to become Prime Minister himself: his legally questionable marriage in Chicago to his newly divorced former landlady, and his later involvement in a trust company scandal.

==Background==

Born in Carleton County, Colony of New Brunswick, Foster received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of New Brunswick in 1868.

He taught in various high schools and seminaries until 1870 when he was appointed Professor of Classics and Ancient Literature in the University of New Brunswick. He shortly afterwards studied in Edinburgh, Scotland, and Heidelberg, German Empire, resuming his professorship in 1873. He resigned in 1879 and became a noted temperance lecturer.

Foster entered politics with his election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1882 federal election as a Conservative MP representing New Brunswick. He joined the Cabinet of Sir John A. Macdonald as Minister of Marine and Fisheries in 1885, and was promoted to Minister of Finance in 1888. Foster retained this position after Macdonald&#x27;s death and through the successive governments of Prime Ministers Abbott, Thompson, Bowell and Tupper. He led a group of seven cabinet ministers who resigned temporarily in January 1896 to force the retirement of Bowell, who denounced them as a &#x27;nest of traitors&#x27;. Foster&#x27;s debates with Sir Richard Cartwright, the former Liberal Minister of Finance under Prime Minister Mackenzie, are the stuff of Canadian Parliamentary legend.

With the defeat of the Tories in the 1896 election, Foster retained his seat and joined the Opposition. He was a prominent supporter of Canada&#x27;s involvement in the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1901. He lost his seat in the 1900 election but returned to parliament in 1904, this time representing the riding of Toronto North in Ontario. He remained an Opposition MP until his party returned to government in the 1911 federal election under Sir Robert Borden and he continued in the government under Arthur Meighen.

During his final years in cabinet, Foster served as Minister of Trade and Commerce, and received a knighthood (KCMG) in 1914 for his work in the Royal Commission on Imperial Trade; he was named to the Imperial Privy Council in 1916 and elevated to GCMG in 1918. He served as a Canadian delegate to the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference. He was acting Prime Minister in 1920, when Borden was absent due to ill health. From 1920 to 1921, he was chairman of the Canadian delegation to the first assembly of the League of Nations. In 1921, he was appointed to the Canadian Senate in which he served until his death.

===&quot;Splendid isolation&quot;===

Foster is known for coining the term &quot;splendid isolation&quot; in January 1896 when praising Britain&#x27;s foreign policy of isolation from European affairs.

The term was popularized by Lord Goschen, First Lord of the Admiralty, during a speech at Lewes on 26 February 1896: &quot;We have stood here alone in what is called isolation – our splendid isolation, as one of our colonial friends was good enough to call it.&quot; The phrase had appeared in a headline in &quot;The Times&quot;, on 22 January 1896, paraphrasing a comment by Foster to the Parliament of Canada on 16 January 1896: &quot;In these somewhat troublesome days when the great Mother Empire stands splendidly isolated in Europe.&quot;

The ultimate origin of &quot;splendid isolation&quot; is suggested in Robert Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Quotations and Phrases&quot;, which places the Foster quotation beneath a passage from the following paragraph from Cooney&#x27;s &quot;Compendious History of Northern New Brunswick and Gaspé&quot; (reprinted in 1896) describing England&#x27;s situation in 1809–1810 during the Napoleonic Wars:In the midst of this terrific commotion, England stood erect: wrapt up in her own impregnability, the storm could not affect her: and therefore, while others trembled in its blast, she smiled at its fury. Never did the &#x27;Empress Island&#x27; appear so magnificently grand; – she stood by herself, and there was a peculiar splendour in the loneliness of her glory.

This, in turn, echoes the stoicism of Marcus Aurelius: &quot;Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break, but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it.&quot;

==Death and family==

His first wife was the ex-spouse of Daniel Black Chisholm, a former Liberal-Conservative Ontario MP, and his second wife was a daughter of Sir William Allan, a former British MP for Gateshead.

He died without children. Foster and his first wife are buried in Ottawa&#x27;s Beechwood Cemetery, near the grave of Sir Cecil Spring Rice.

Following his death, Foster&#x27;s widow granted Canadian historian William Stewart Wallace permission to produce an authorized biography of her late husband. Wallace was provided manuscripts, papers, and diary entries handwritten by Foster, including an unfinished autobiography. Wallace&#x27;s biography of Foster, titled &quot;The Memoirs of the Rt. Hon. Sir George Foster,&quot; was published in 1933.

<doc id="1028861" wikidata="Q3321915" url="?curid=1028861" title="Mount Lady Macdonald">
<text>Mount Lady Macdonald is a mountain located within Bow Valley Provincial Park in the Bow River valley at the town of Canmore, which is located just east of Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada.

The mountain was named in 1886 after Susan Agnes Macdonald, wife of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The Macdonalds travelled on the new national railway through the Canadian Rockies in 1886 on their way to Vancouver.

Hikers may hike a trail that begins in Cougar Creek and continues to a helipad just short of the knife&#x27;s edge ridge that leads to the top of the mountain. On the top under a cairn there is a canister in which a pencil and a list of those who have climbed there are stored.

==Geology==
It is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, it is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 C with wind chill factors below -30 C. Weather conditions during summer months are optimum for climbing.

<doc id="1028862" wikidata="Q3958310" url="?curid=1028862" title="Seven Soldiers of Victory">
<text>The Seven Soldiers of Victory (also known as Law&#x27;s Legionnaires) is a team of fictional comic book superheroes in the DC Comics universe. They first appeared in &quot;Leading Comics&quot; #1 (Winter 1941), and were created by Mort Weisinger and Mort Meskin. The team was a short-lived assembly of some of the less famous superheroes in the DC Universe who have made occasional appearances since their Golden Age debut.

==Fictional team history==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
The Seven Soldiers of Victory (also known as the Law&#x27;s Legionnaires) is DC Comics&#x27; second super-hero team, following the Justice Society of America. Like the Justice Society, the membership of the Seven Soldiers is drawn from DC&#x27;s anthology comics: The Vigilante (from &quot;Action Comics&quot;); the Crimson Avenger (from &quot;Detective Comics&quot;); the Green Arrow and Speedy (from &quot;More Fun Comics&quot;); the Shining Knight (from &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;); and the Star-Spangled Kid and Stripesy (from &quot;Star-Spangled Comics&quot;).

Unlike most superhero teams, this one includes two sidekicks, Speedy and Stripesy, as members (Stripesy is a rarity, an adult sidekick to a &quot;kid&quot; lead character). The Crimson Avenger&#x27;s sidekick Wing also takes part in the team&#x27;s adventures, and is in every other way an &quot;eighth Soldier&quot;, but is never considered an &quot;official&quot; member. All but one of its members (the Shining Knight, a time-displaced Arthurian knight who rides a winged horse and uses an enchanted sword and suit of armor) are non-powered humans who rely on conventional weapons or training in place of superhuman abilities.

Per &quot;Leading Comics&quot; #1, the team&#x27;s origin comes about when the criminal mastermind called the Hand (later the Iron Hand), believing himself terminally ill, gives his greatest unused schemes to five other supercriminals who he saved from the police (Big Caesar, the Dummy, the Needle, Professor Merlin, and the Red Dragon) to commit crimes across the U.S. as &quot;the Hand&#x27;s Five Fingers&quot; and prove his genius to the world. The Hand also challenges the five criminals&#x27; enemies (the Crimson Avenger, the Vigilante, the Star-Spangled Kid and Stripesy, the Green Arrow and Speedy and the Shining Knight, respectively) to stop the criminals, presuming they will fail. However, the heroes defeat the Hand&#x27;s Five Fingers. The heroes converge on the Hand&#x27;s base after he reveals his whereabouts; the villain had found out a cure for his condition and decides to eliminate the heroes so he can remain free, but the heroes evade his traps. When the villain tries to use a lightning ray machine against them, the Vigilante shoots a crucial component of the device, bringing machinery down upon the Hand and apparently killing him. Deciding they work well together, the heroes form the Seven Soldiers of Victory.

The Seven Soldiers of Victory appear in the first 14 issues of &quot;Leading Comics&quot; (which changed to an all-humor format in #15).

A script by Joseph Samachson from the 1940s, in which the elflike Willie Wisher banishes the Soldiers to &quot;the Land of Magic&quot;, where they encounter various supernatural characters, was later serialized in 1975 in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #438–443, with each chapter illustrated by a different artist (including Dick Dillin, Howard Chaykin, Lee Elias, Mike Grell, Ernie Chan, and José Luis García-López).

====Return====
The team is resurrected in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #100–102. During the celebration of their 100th meeting, the JLA is brought to Earth-Two by the Justice Society of America, where a giant ethereal hand controlled by the Iron Hand (who turned up alive) threatens to destroy their world unless he is given control over it. Having been unable to destroy the hand themselves, the only clue the JSA could find was a mystical vision of a grave for &quot;the Unknown Soldier of Victory&quot;. An unearthly Oracle, summoned up by Doctor Fate, Zatanna, and the Thunderbolt of Johnny Thunder, reveals to the JLA and the JSA that the Seven Soldiers had fought and destroyed a similar menace called the Nebula Man many years previously, though at the seeming cost of their existences. The Oracle then explains that the Soldiers had instead been scattered throughout history. The two teams split into smaller groups and are sent back in time by the Oracle to find them.

Doctor Fate, the Atom, and the Elongated Man find the Crimson Avenger in Mexico, where he believes he is the Aztec sun god.Superman, the Sandman, and Metamorpho rescue the amnesic Shining Knight from the hordes of Genghis Khan. Hawkman, Doctor Mid-Nite, and the Golden Age Wonder Woman find the Golden Age Green Arrow in medieval England, where he had been mistaken for Robin Hood. Batman, Hourman, and Starman retrieve Stripesy from ancient Egypt.

The Silver Age Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Johnny Thunder and the Thunderbolt save the Vigilante from a tribe of Indians in the Old West. Aquaman, Wildcat and the Silver Age Green Lantern rescue the Star-Spangled Kid from 50,000 years in the past. Zatanna, the Silver Age Flash and the Red Tornado free Speedy from ancient Greece where he had been transformed into a centaur by Circe. The Golden Age Green Lantern, Mister Terrific and the Golden Age Robin go on a quest to discover the identity of the Unknown Soldier of Victory, whose tomb lay in the mountains of Tibet where the Seven Soldiers had fallen after defeating the Nebula Man. The Seven Soldiers are reunited, but Earth-1 and Diana Prince had been attacked by the Iron Hand. She is able to overcome him, but he is no longer able to stop the giant hand. The heroes create a new Nebula Rod to deal with the giant hand, but whoever uses the Nebula Rod is certain to perish (as did the Crimson Avenger&#x27;s partner Wing, revealed to be the Unknown Soldier of Victory, when the Nebula Man was stopped). While the heroes argue over who will make the sacrifice, the android Red Tornado takes the Nebula Rod and destroys the Hand, destroying himself in the process.

The only other modern meeting of the team (either in Pre- or Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity) takes place in &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; #11, in which the Vigilante, the Shining Knight, the Green Arrow, Speedy and the Star-Spangled Kid gather at the grave of Lee Travis, the man known as the Crimson Avenger. He had died two years earlier saving Gotham City from a boatload of explosives in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #38.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
====First team====
In the original Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; retcon of the team, both Wing and the Vigilante&#x27;s sidekick Stuff the Chinatown Kid are promoted to full membership, to replace the Golden Age Green Arrow and Speedy, who had been removed from active continuity. Stuff had never appeared with the team during the original &quot;Leading Comics&quot; run, while an older man named Billy Gunn helped out the Vigilante on his cases in the comic.

This retcon is changed in the late nineties, in &quot;Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot; #9. While Stuff remains a full member, Wing is not an official Soldier because his mentor the Crimson Avenger wants him to do something more important with his life. The remaining spot on the team is filled by the Spider, an archer who had originally appeared in Quality Comics&#x27; &quot;Crack Comics&quot;. This Spider is really a villain and has been working with the team&#x27;s archenemy the Hand, creator of the original Nebula Man. The Spider sabotages the Nebula Rod, and sends the team to fight a fruitless battle. The villain tries to kill Wing, but he escapes and reaches the other Soldiers. They repair the Nebula Rod and use it to destroy the Nebula Man. Wing dies and his teammates are again tossed through time and later retrieved by the JLA and JSA. The only major difference between this story and the 1972 story is that this time the Vigilante is found after he had spent nearly 20 years fighting crime in the Old West.

In 2010&#x27;s &quot;DC Universe: Legacies&quot; #2, TNT and Dyna-Mite are retconned into the team&#x27;s original line-up. It has not yet been revealed precisely how this retcon affects the respective histories of the Spider, TNT or Dyna-Mite.

The Seven Soldiers have not reformed in the Modern Age (partly due to Grant Morrison&#x27;s project). Three of the originals-the Shining Knight, the Vigilante and Stripesy (now STRIPE)-remain. The team has inspired a few legacies. The first is Stargirl, who at first carries the mantle of the Star-Spangled Kid in memory of Sylvester Pemberton. She is now a double legacy, as she also carries on the legacy of Starman. The second legacy is the new Crimson Avenger, who has appeared sporadically in the series &quot;JSA&quot;. She has yet to make an appearance &quot;One Year Later&quot;, though she is seen towards the end of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. The third one is Gardner Grayle, the Atomic Knight. The last one is the new Sir Justin in Grant Morrison&#x27;s project.

====Second team====
Another group takes the name of the Seven Soldiers of Victory in the &quot;Showcase&quot; issue of the miniseries known as &quot;Silver Age&quot;. This group, brought together to help the Justice League of America and the other major heroes and teams of the 1960s to battle the menace of Agamemno, consists of Adam Strange, Batgirl, Blackhawk, Deadman, Mento, Metamorpho, and a new Shining Knight. This group&#x27;s Shining Knight is Gardner Grayle from the Silver Age feature &quot;The Atomic Knights&quot;; in previously published stories that occurred after the &quot;Silver Age&quot; limited series, he becomes the Atomic Knight and joins the Outsiders. This is the only appearance of this particular assemblage.

===Seven Soldiers===

Seven Soldiers is a comic book metaseries written by Grant Morrison and published by DC Comics. It was published as seven interrelated mini-series and two bookend issues. The series features a new version of the Seven Soldiers of Victory fighting to save Earth from the Sheeda.

The series was bookended by &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot; #0 and #1, with art by J. H. Williams III. The rest was made up of seven mini-series: &quot;Shining Knight&quot; with art by Simone Bianchi, &quot;Manhattan Guardian&quot; with art by Cameron Stewart, &quot;Zatanna&quot; with art by Ryan Sook, &quot;Klarion&quot; with art by Frazer Irving, &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; with art by Pascal Ferry, &quot;Bulleteer&quot; with art by Yanick Paquette, and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; with art by Doug Mahnke.

===The New Golden Age===
In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, the Seven Soldiers of Victory reunite upon being summoned by Jill Carlyle. While Jill takes the adults on a mission, Stargirl and Red Arrow find out that they are going after Clock King. They find the Seven Soldiers of Victory fighting Clock King on a ship where the original Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis) had died. Before Stargirl destroys Per Degaton&#x27;s time machine that sends the ship back to its own time, Crimson Avenger tells her to find Wing. Once time is fixed, history was changed so that Travis&#x27; body was found. A funeral was held by the Justice League and the Justice Society of America. The next day, Courtney joins Pat and the Seven Soldiers of Victory for breakfast.

===Halo Corporation===
The re-integration of the Wildstorm characters into the DCU saw a relaunch of the &quot;Wildcats&quot; title. In issue #2-3, Jacob Marlowe unveils a version of the Seven Soldiers of Victory that will serve as a public &#x27;face&#x27; and PR cover for the covert actions of the Wildcats team. This team consists of Threshold (formerly of Dv8), Majestic, Andromache, Maul, Mother One, Agent Wax, and Pike.

<doc id="1028868" wikidata="Q1405782" url="?curid=1028868" title="Mahindra Satyam">
<text>Mahindra Satyam (formerly Satyam Computer Services Limited) was an Indian information technology (IT) services company based in Hyderabad, India, offering software development, system maintenance, packaged software integration and engineering design services. Satyam Computer Services was listed on the Pink Sheets, the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange and provided services to a wide range of customers including 185 Fortune 500 companies.

In January 2009, the company&#x27;s founder and chairman Ramalinga Raju admitted to inflating the company&#x27;s assets by $1 billion, leading to criminal charges and a collapse of the company&#x27;s stock price. This was known as Satyam Scandal. Mahindra Group&#x27;s IT arm, Tech Mahindra, purchased a major stake in the company and in June 2009 the company renamed itself Mahindra Satyam. Mahindra Satyam merged with Tech Mahindra on 24 June 2013.

==History==
Satyam Computer Services was founded in 1987 and by 2008 earned revenues of over $2 billion, employing 52,000 IT professionals across the world. It was one of India&#x27;s five top IT companies, and focused on the enterprise segment. It had an extensive client list including 185 Fortune 500 companies. The company was the subject of what was called India&#x27;s biggest corporate scandal in January 2009 when then-chairman Byrraju Ramalinga Raju admitted in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Board of India that the corporate accounts had been falsified, adding approximately $1 billion to the company&#x27;s cash and cash-related assets. The government appointed a board to oversee the sale of the company. Tech Mahindra offered to purchase a majority stake in April 2009, and the company was rebranded as Mahindra Satyam in June 2009.

Tech Mahindra announced its plan to merge with Mahindra Satyam on 21 March 2012, after the boards of both companies gave their approval. The Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange, and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) also approved. Shareholders unanimously approved the move in January 2013. The merger ran into delays due to ambiguity over jurisdiction between investigating agencies and the government, and two tax cases totaling over 27 billion. On 11 June 2013 Andhra Pradesh High Court approved the merger, after the Bombay high court gave its approval.

A new management structure was announced for the new entity, led by Anand Mahindra as Chairman, Vineet Nayyar as Vice Chairman and C. P. Gurnani as the CEO and Managing Director. The merger was announced to be complete on 25 June 2013, creating India&#x27;s fifth largest software services company with a turnover of US$2.7 billion. Mahindra Satyam shareholders received two shares of Tech Mahindra stock for every 17 shares of Mahindra Satyam stock they owned. Shares in the new entity began trading on 12 July 2013.

On 24 July 2013, a division bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court admitted a petition filed by Ekadanta Greenfields and Saptaswara Agro Farms challenging the Mahindra Satyam-Tech Mahindra merger order. The two firms argued that their objections to the merger had not been considered in full.

===Finances===
After the scandal hit, the company&#x27;s revenue collapsed and the new chairman, Vineet Nayyar, suggested that a turnaround would take three years. By the April–June quarter of 2011, the company was profitable once again. In 2013 Mahindra Satyam declared a 30% dividend. Nayyar commented &quot;The turnaround of Mahindra Satyam is symbolically and practically complete. The merger (with Tech Mahindra), which is in its penultimate phase, will open a new chapter for the company. We thank all stakeholders for supporting us during this crucial phase&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Tax evasion===
Before the asset inflation scandal hit, the Income Tax Department had issued notices to the company seeking 6.17 billion tax, for the assessment years from 2003–04 to 2008–09 after disallowing exemptions claimed by the software firm. The Central Board of Direct Taxes attached the properties of Mahindra Satyam on 30 January 2012, after issuing notices to the company seeking payment of the tax. The Andhra Pradesh High Court stayed the order in February 2012.

===Maytas acquisition===
In December 2008, Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju made a final attempt to conceal his falsification of the Satyam Computer Services balance sheets by acquiring Maytas Infrastructure and Maytas Properties for $1.6 billion, despite concerns raised by independent directors. Both companies were founded by Raju&#x27;s family members (Maytas is &quot;Satyam&quot; reversed) and were owned by Raju&#x27;s sons. This eventually led to a review of the deal by the government, and a veiled criticism by the then Vice President of India Hamid Ansari. Several of Satyam&#x27;s clients responded by re-evaluating their relationship with the company. Satyam&#x27;s investors lost about in the related panic selling, as Satyam&#x27;s shares fell 55% on the New York Stock Exchange. Four members of the board of directors resigned on 29 December 2008.

===Accounting scandal===

On 7 January 2009, Chairman Raju resigned after publicly announcing his involvement in a massive accounting fraud, in which he had inflated the company&#x27;s cash assets by over $1 billion. In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, he explained that &quot;what started as a marginal gap between actual operating profit and the one reflected in the books of accounts continued to grow over the years ... It has attained unmanageable proportions as the size of the company operations grew significantly&quot;.

In 2015, Raju was sentenced to seven years in jail and fined about $800,000.

<doc id="1028879" wikidata="Q1109610" url="?curid=1028879" title="New World Street, Warsaw">
<text>Nowy Świat (), known in English as New World Street, is one of the main historic thoroughfares of Warsaw, Poland. It comprises part of the Royal Route (&quot;Trakt królewski&quot;) that extends from Warsaw&#x27;s Royal Castle and Old Town, south to King John III Sobieski&#x27;s 17th-century royal residence at Wilanów.

==Geography==
&quot;Nowy Świat&quot; runs from Three Crosses Square northwards, intersecting Jerusalem Avenue and Świętokrzyska Street (Holy Cross Street). Near the Warsaw University campus and the Nicolaus Copernicus monument it changes into &quot;Krakowskie Przedmieście&quot; (Cracow Suburb Street), which then runs all the way to the Royal Castle at Castle Square.

At its southern end, at Three Crosses Square, &quot;Nowy Świat&quot; changes into Ujazdów Avenue, which changes into Belweder Street, which becomes Sobieski Street as it continues coursing south, ultimately to arrive at Wilanów.

==History==

Until the 16th century, &quot;Nowy Świat&quot; was a main road leading to numerous aristocratic palaces and villages south of Warsaw. The street&#x27;s present name was coined in the 17th century, after the city had begun growing substantially (c.1640). By the turn of the 18th century, the fields along &quot;Nowy Świat&quot; had become densely urbanized, mostly with wooden palaces and manors. Gutters had been constructed, and the street itself was paved with cobblestones.

In the Napoleonic period, Warsaw grew substantially and &quot;Nowy Świat&quot; was almost completely rebuilt. Wooden manors gave way to stone and brick, mostly three-story, neoclassical buildings. By the end of the 19th century, the buildings had been expanded and &quot;Nowy Świat&quot; had become one of the principal business streets of Warsaw. It was also one of the more heavily trafficked streets, with numerous shops and restaurants that attracted Varsovians as well as tourists. Larger new buildings replaced the earlier ones, and the character of the street changed. In the early 20th century, almost all trace of neoclassical architecture was lost as new buildings were erected mostly in Art Nouveau style.

During the Warsaw Uprising (August–October 1944), &quot;Nowy Świat&quot; was almost completely destroyed. The Germans reduced most of its fine building as it was one of the most important streets in the center of Warsaw. At war&#x27;s end, it was decided to rebuild &quot;Nowy Świat&quot;. As restoring its prewar &quot;art nouveau&quot; state would have been prohibitive, it was reverted to its early-19th-century appearance. Post-war reconstruction of the street was directed by the architect Zygmunt Stępiński.

Today, Nowy Świat boasts many shops, restaurants, and cafes. It is considered to be a prime location for luxury retailers.

<text>The National Quilt Museum, located in Paducah, Kentucky, is an art museum that exhibits fiber art and quilting from around the world. The museum is recognized by &quot;USA Today&quot; as one of the world&#x27;s top quilt displays. This textile museum supports local and expert quilters by providing workshops and other educational activities.

The National Quilt Museum was established by Bill and Meredith Schroeder of Paducah and opened to the public on April 25, 1991. It is the only museum dedicated to contemporary quilts and quiltmakers. The main gallery is devoted to a rotating selection from the museum&#x27;s collection of over 600 quilts. Its two other galleries exhibit rotating fiber art exhibits throughout the year. Its founding executive director was Victoria Faoro. The museum also features a traveling exhibit that is made up of quilts and fiber art.

In addition, the museum also offers educational opportunities for adults and kids at all skill levels. In 1993 the museum hosted the first African American Quilters Forum and in 1995 the museum developed &quot;Gatherings&quot;, an exhibit and conference celebrating quilt documentation projects completed across the country.

The museum was honored in May 2008 when the U.S. Congress designated it the National Quilt Museum of the United States. May Louise Zumwalt, former executive director of the museum, said &quot;Though it does not mean we will receive national funding, it does recognize that we are a quilt museum with national significance.&quot; This designation brings additional attention and helps increase the number of visitors. The museum averages 40,000 visitors per year.

In July 2021, Matt Collinsworth became chief executive officer of the museum.

<text>Grotto Mountain is a mountain located in the Bow River valley, across from Canmore, Alberta, Canada. It is a popular hiking spot among locals and is home to the Rat&#x27;s Nest Cave.

The mountain was named for a grotto-like cave within it.

The pictographs where the creek first narrows into canyon area warning of FALLING ROCK ! Made ~3000 years ago perhaps by the Hopi tribe, stand under there long enough you will be hit by rock slides as the paintings exhibit broken things and animals ...

There are two main scrambling routes:
* Northwest Variation - from the ACC clubhouse, ascends the northwest side of the mountain on a good hiking trail. At tree line, the trail narrows to the false summit. From there, it is a gradual ascent to the summit with brief stints of scrambling but mostly hiking.
* Direct route. Ascends directly under the summit. Shorter but more arduous.

<text>La&#x27;Roi Damon Glover (; born July 4, 1974) is an American professional football coach and former player who is the defensive line coach for the St. Louis BattleHawks of the United Football League (UFL). He played as a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL). Glover played college football for the San Diego State Aztecs. He enjoyed a 13-year career in which he made six-consecutive Pro Bowls and was a four-time All-Pro selection. He spent five seasons with the New Orleans Saints (1997–2001), four seasons with the Dallas Cowboys (2002–2005) and finished his playing career with the St. Louis Rams (2006–2008).

==Early life==
Born in San Diego, California, Glover graduated from Point Loma High School of San Diego in 1992. At Point Loma, Glover lettered in football, wrestling, and track, and he earned awards in all three sports. Under coach Bennie Edens, he was part of the 1990 Pointers team that included Dan White and J. J. Stokes. During the 1990 season, Glover totaled 77 tackles, 17.5 sacks, six fumble recoveries and six forced fumbles, earning the honor of San Diego Co-Player of the Year. In 1991 as a senior defensive lineman, he was named San Diego section co-Player of the Year, USA Today second-team All-America and CIF Player of the Year, Cal-Hi Sports first-team, the Los Angeles Times Lineman of the Year.

He is the third player from Point Loma High School to have his jersey (No. 76) retired along with Marcel Brown (No. 22) and Eric Allen (No. 25).

==College career==
Although he had various college offers, he chose to follow his older brother Darcel Glover to San Diego State University and remain close to home.

While attending SDSU, Glover was a four-year starter in football. As a senior, he had 4.5 sacks and 36 tackles, was a defensive captain, won Aztec Outstanding Defensive Lineman honors, an All-Western Athletic Conference second-team selection, and was chosen to play for the West squad in the East–West Shrine Game. As a sophomore, he was a second-team All-Western Athletic Conference selection. As a freshman, he won All-Western Athletic Conference honorable mention honors. He graduated from San Diego State in 1999 with double major in public administration and sociology.

In 2010, San Diego State athletics inducted Glover to the Aztec Hall of Fame. As of 2010, Glover ranked third all-time at San Diego State with 44.5 tackles for loss and fourth all-time in sacks (18.5).

==Professional playing career==
===Oakland Raiders (1996)===
The Oakland Raiders drafted Glover with the 34th pick in the fifth round of the 1996 NFL draft. In his NFL debut on November 19, Glover made two tackles against the Minnesota Vikings. His only other game in the season was next week on November 26 against the Seattle Seahawks on defensive line and special teams.

===Barcelona Dragons (1997)===
In the spring of 1997, Glover played for the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football. Earning all-league honors, Glover helped the Dragons win World Bowl &#x27;97 and ranked third in the league with 6.5 sacks and adding 36 tackles.

===New Orleans Saints (1997–2001)===
The day after the Raiders waived him, Glover signed with the New Orleans Saints on August 25, 1997. Although he started only 2 of 15 games played in 1997, Glover recorded 6.5 sacks, one forced fumble, a recovered fumble, and 24 tackles. In 1998, Glover started 15 of 16 games and had 59 tackles, 10 sacks, three forced fumbles, and an interception. Glover then made 8.5 sacks, 46 tackles, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery in 1999.

&quot;Glover proved everybody wrong, especially our defensive coaches in New Orleans who initially thought he was too small to play in the middle of our 4-3,&quot; said former Saints president/general manager Bill Kuharich who gives credit to pro personnel man Chet Franklin for spotting Glover. &quot;He turned out to be the greatest waiver claim in the history of the Saints.&quot;

He was a solid starter during his three seasons with Mike Ditka, but his career blossomed when Jim Haslett was hired as the Saints coach in 2000 and decided to move him to the three-technique tackle within a great front four group.

That season, he led the NFL with 17 sacks – a rare feat and second most ever by a defensive tackle – and was named NFC Defensive Player of the Year. He also became a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection and earned a Pro Bowl berth as he helped lead the Saints to a division championship and first-ever playoff win. He was also voted the New Orleans Saints defensive MVP. Amidst his accolades, Glover boasted 53 tackles, three forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. In the Saints&#x27; come-from-behind 28–27 victory over the San Diego Chargers in Week 2 (September 10), Glover twice sacked Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf and forced 4th-and-22 in the Chargers&#x27; final drive.

During his tenure in New Orleans, he was also a recipient of the Saints &quot;Man of the Year&quot; and &quot;Unsung Hero&quot; awards. In 2013, the team elected Glover to the Saints Hall of Fame for the Class of 2013. Glover was the lone choice of the Saints Hall of Fame Media Selection Committee.

===Dallas Cowboys (2002–2005)===
Following an impressive five-year run with the Saints, the Dallas Cowboys quickly swooped in and signed Glover to a multi-year deal. At the time, the team had endured back-to-back 5–11 seasons.

During his time with the Cowboys, Glover solidified his place as one of the best defensive tackles in the NFL. He also provided a veteran locker room presence, helped anchor a young defensive line and was an integral part of the transformation from a losing team into one that returned to the playoffs. While in Dallas, he earned four consecutive Pro Bowl nominations (2002-2005) and was named All-Pro in 2002 and 2003. He played in all 64 games during his four seasons with the Cowboys, registered 21.5 sacks and forced five fumbles.

His last season with the team in 2005, the defense switched to a 3-4 alignment, where he started splitting playing time with Jason Ferguson and was eventually relegated to a backup role in early December. He was released at the end of the year, because he wasn&#x27;t seen as a good fit for the new defense and salary cap considerations.

Glover made the most of his relatively brief stay, leaving as one of the best players in franchise history and one of its best free agent signings. He is the only Cowboys player to make the Pro Bowl in his first four seasons with the team.

===St. Louis Rams (2006–2008)===
In 2006, Glover signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Rams, reuniting him with Jim Haslett. He was the Rams 2007 Walter Payton Man of the Year.

On June 22, 2009, Glover officially announced his retirement from the National Football League. After a decorated professional career, he was named to the NFL 2000s All-Decade team.

During his career, he played 13 seasons, went to six straight Pro Bowls, had 433 tackles and 83.5 sacks, eight forced fumbles and two interceptions. He was an extremely durable player and compensated for a lack of size with great tenacity and textbook technique.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
==Coaching career==
Glover was hired by the Los Angeles Chargers as their assistant defensive line coach on April 9, 2019. He missed the team&#x27;s week 13 game against the New England Patriots in 2020.

Glover was officially hired by the St. Louis BattleHawks on September 13, 2022. On July 24, 2023, he was named as a guest assistant coach for the Saints for training camp and the preseason via the Bill Walsh Diversity Coaching fellowship.

==Personal life==
He is married to Spring, and they have three children: La&#x27;Roi Jr., Noemie and Sophia. Glover earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Fontbonne University in St. Louis, MO in 2012.

In 2010, the St. Louis Rams hired Glover as the Director of Player Engagement, where he helps players make the transition to pro football and assist them with various off-field matters.

Glover is a guest member on the Football Night sportscaster team of San Diego television station KNSD (NBC 7/39).

<doc id="1028895" wikidata="Q3490289" url="?curid=1028895" title="ESCM (album)">
<text>ESCM (initialism for Electric Sky Church Music) is the second studio album by American electronic musician BT, released on September 22, 1997.

==Background and recording==
Following &quot;Ima&quot;, Transeau branched out to create club anthems such as &quot;Flaming June&quot;, while also drawing inspiration from drum and bass as well as hip hop. &quot;ESCM&quot; also features Transeau adding live guitar, bass and drums to songs, as well as the use of a strings ensemble.

The majority of the album was produced and mixed by Transeau at Blue House on a Hill Studios, with the exception of string recordings that were done at Abbey Road Studios in London. &quot;Solar Plexus&quot; was recorded partially at Omega Studios in Rockville, Maryland.

Amongst the tracks recorded during the sessions but left unreleased were the track &quot;Lemon Balm and Chamomile&quot;, written with Che Malcolm, and &quot;Flesh&quot;, written with Jan Johnston. The latter track would later be remixed for a single release by Johnston in 2001.

==Release==
The album was released on 22 September 1997 and supported by three singles; &quot;Flaming June&quot;, &quot;Remember&quot;, and &quot;Love, Peace and Grease&quot;, all of which charted in the UK.

Like &quot;Ima&quot;, &quot;ESCM&quot; was also mixed to sound like one continuous mix. For US pressings, the loungy drum and bass track &quot;The Road to Lostwithiel&quot; was replaced with the more straightforward &quot;Lullaby for Gaia&quot;. Both songs were later made available, in unmixed form, on the retrospect album, &quot;10 Years in the Life&quot;. The US pressing also features an edited version of &quot;Love, Peace, and Grease&quot;.

The cover of the album and its singles feature an interpretation of a Monolith from Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

<text>Charles Joseph Doherty, (May 11, 1855 – July 28, 1931) was a Canadian politician, lawyer, and judge from Quebec. He served as Minister of Justice from 1911 to 1921 and was one of Canada&#x27;s representatives at the Paris Peace Conference.

==Early life and education==

Doherty was born in Montreal, Canada East, the son of Marcus Doherty, an Irish-born judge of the Supreme Court for the Province of Quebec and Elizabeth (O&#x27;Halloran) Doherty. He attended St. Mary&#x27;s (Jesuit) College and received a Bachelor of Laws degree from McGill University in 1876 winning the Elizabeth Torrance Gold Medal for highest academic achievement.

==Career==
Doherty was admitted to the bar in 1877. He was a candidate for the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for the electoral district of Montreal West in the 1881 election, but was defeated. In 1885 he served as a lieutenant with the 65th Battalion, Mount Royal Rifles in the North-West Rebellion. He ran for office again for Montreal Centre in the 1886 election.

Doherty was created a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1887. He worked as a lawyer and also taught civil and International law at McGill University prior to being appointed a judge on the Quebec Superior Court from 1891 until 1906. During this time he served as the president of the main Irish fraternal organization in Montreal, St. Patrick&#x27;s Society in 1902 and 1903. In 1909 he became a professor of international and civil law at McGill University.

He was elected as the Conservative candidate to the House of Commons of Canada for the electoral district of St. Anne in the 1908 federal election. When the Tories won the 1911 election, the new Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, brought Doherty into the Canadian Cabinet as Minister of Justice.

Doherty played a role in the creation of the Canadian Bar Association in 1912 and served as its president in 1914.

At the end of World War I, Doherty was one of the Canadian delegates to the Paris Peace Conference, and served as Canadian delegate to the League of Nations from 1920 to 1922. He was appointed to the Imperial Privy Council in the 1920 New Year Honours for his service at Versailles, allowing him to use the title of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.

Doherty remained Minister of Justice in the government of Arthur Meighen until its defeat in 1921.

<text>The 802.9 Working Group of the IEEE 802 networking committee developed standards for integrated voice and data access over existing Category 3 twisted-pair network cable installations. Its major standard was usually known as isoEthernet. 

IsoEthernet combines 10 megabits per second Ethernet and 96 64-kilobits per second ISDN B channels. It was originally developed to provide data and voice/video over the same wire without degradation by fixing the amount of bandwidth assigned to the Ethernet and B-channel sides.

There was some vendor support for isoEthernet, but it lost in the marketplace due to the rapid adoption of Fast Ethernet and the working group was disbanded.

<text>Down with Love is a 2003 romantic comedy film directed by Peyton Reed. It stars Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor and is a pastiche of the early-1960s American &quot;no-sex sex comedies&quot;, such as &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; and &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; (both starring Rock Hudson, Doris Day, and Tony Randall) and the &quot;myriad spawn&quot; of derivative films that followed; &quot;Time&quot; film critic Richard Corliss wrote that &quot;Down with Love&quot; &quot;is so clogged with specific references to a half-dozen Rock-and-Doris-type comedies that it serves as definitive distillation of the genre.&quot; Randall himself plays a small role in &quot;Down with Love&quot;, &quot;bestowing his sly, patriarchal blessing&quot; on the film, which also stars David Hyde Pierce (in the neurotic best friend role often played by Randall or Gig Young), Sarah Paulson, Rachel Dratch, Jeri Ryan, and Jack Plotnick, who spoofs the kind of role Chet Stratton played in &quot;Lover Come Back&quot;.

Typical of the genre, the film tells the story of a woman who advocates female independence in combat with a lothario; the plot reflects the attitudes and behaviour of the early pre-sexual revolution 1960s but has an anachronistic conclusion driven by more modern, post-feminist ideas and attitudes. Though the film received a mixed critical response at the time of release and underperformed at the box office, it has since undergone a critical reappraisal and grown a cult following for its subversion of rom-com conventions.

==Plot==

In 1962, aspiring author Barbara Novak arrives in New York to promote her book, &quot;Down with Love&quot;, to Banner House publishing. It is about freeing women from love, enjoying sex without commitment, and replacing the need for a man with things such as chocolate. Barbara believes that her rules will help boost women in the workplace and the world in general.

When Banner House&#x27;s male executives do not appreciate the book, Vikki Hiller, Barbara&#x27;s editor, suggests that Barbara meet with Catcher Block—a successful writer for &quot;Know&quot; magazine—to help promote the book. However, Catcher repeatedly avoids meeting Barbara until, fed up, she insults him. Catcher&#x27;s boss and best friend, Peter MacMannus, and Vikki develop a mutual attraction, but neither is brave enough to express their feelings. Peter feels overshadowed by Catcher&#x27;s strong personality, and Vikki wants to see strength in her lover, even assuming Peter must be gay.

Barbara and Vikki persuade Judy Garland to sing &quot;Down with Love&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; to promote the book. Sales skyrocket, as women around the world rebel against their men; Catcher now wants to meet Barbara but &quot;she&quot; rejects &quot;him&quot;. The breaking point comes as Barbara appears on a national TV show and discusses a chapter from her book—&quot;The Worst Kind of Man&quot;—and cites Catcher Block as the perfect example, causing the women he dates to reject him.

Catcher schemes to prove that Barbara really wants love and marriage like every other woman. He poses as Major Zip Martin, an attentive astronaut with a Southern accent. Barbara becomes infatuated with a man who seems unaware of her celebrity, in contrast to the men who now avoid her since her book was published. As &quot;Zip&quot; takes her to fashionable New York locations, he maintains sexual tension by feigning naiveté and a desire to remain chaste until he is &quot;ready&quot; for a physical relationship. His plan becomes complicated after he starts falling for her.

When Barbara encounters Catcher/Zip at a party, which nearly exposes his true identity, he decides to take things to the next level. He says that Catcher Block wants to interview him for an exposé on the NASA space program and asks her to be there. At his apartment, he sets everything up to record her saying that she loves him. As they are about to have sex, one of his lovers, Gwendolyn, walks in. Not knowing who Barbara is, she exposes Catcher&#x27;s identity, forcing him to confess to Barbara.

Barbara then reveals that she is actually Nancy Brown, one of Catcher&#x27;s many former secretaries, who had fallen in love with him while working at &quot;Know&quot;. She had turned down a date with him, refusing to be another fling. She wanted to be different from the other women he knew, and make him fall in love with her. Catcher proclaims that he wants to marry her, but Gwendolyn, having overheard Barbara Novak&#x27;s name, thanks her for what she has done for womankind.

Barbara realizes that she does not want love or Catcher, as she has become a real &quot;down with love&quot; girl. Vikki and Peter&#x27;s relationship also changes when she insults him for helping Catcher. Peter says that he is like any other man, and takes Vikki to Catcher&#x27;s apartment to have sex with her.

Days later, Catcher is depressed and has failed to win back Barbara. Even his exposé, which he wrote on how falling in love with her made him a better man, is ruined now that Barbara has told her story in her own magazine, &quot;Now&quot;. Catcher goes to &quot;Now&quot; on the pretense of a job interview. He tells Barbara how much she has changed him and wishes there could be a middle ground for them, somewhere between her confident blonde persona and her original brunette self. After he leaves her office, she surprises him on the elevator, showing him a bright-red hair style. She has found the middle ground and wants to be with him. They elope to Las Vegas, inspiring Vikki and Peter to also get married. Barbara and Catcher&#x27;s marriage results in a new book aimed at ending the battle of the sexes.

==Cast==
==Style==
The sets, costumes, cinematography, editing, score, opening credits, and visual effects (including split-screen shots during phone calls heavily laced with double entendres between the two leads), echo the style of Hollywood sex comedies from 1959 to 1964 (from &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; to &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot;). The New York City skyline of 1962 was digitally recreated for backdrops. A greenscreen technique was used to simulate unconvincing 1960s rear projection using restored street footage from the late 1950s and early 1960s. In accordance with the film&#x27;s style, the 1950s 20th Century Fox logo with the CinemaScope logo, a wide-screen process introduced in the 1950s, developed and owned by 20th Century Fox, was utilized with the addition of the byline for News Corporation and the 1998 version of the fanfare, composed by Alfred Newman. The Regency Enterprises logo is in pink, and contains a saxophone jazz rendition of its theme.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Down with Love&quot; was chosen as &quot;the perfect film&quot; to open the second Tribeca Film Festival, where it made its premiere. The film opened first in New York, and was released countrywide a week later on May 16, 2003. The film was released as counter programming against &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. Though the film was highly anticipated, it performed far below box office expectations in comparison with other rom-coms released in the same year, such as &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; and &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, both of which grossed over $100 million. &quot;Down with Love&quot; ultimately made just $39.5 million worldwide on a $35 million budget.

===Critical response===
At the time of its release, &quot;Down With Love&quot; received extremely varying reviews. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert spoke of the film fairly positively, saying parts were &quot;fun&quot; and describing Zellweger&#x27;s speech at the end as &quot;a torrent of words [pouring] out from her character&#x27;s innermost soul&quot;. A. O. Scott in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised director &quot;Reed&#x27;s buoyant homage&quot;, Zellweger&#x27;s Doris Day-like ability to &quot;swivel engagingly between goofiness and sex appeal&quot;, McGregor&#x27;s Sinatra-like &quot;wiry, wolfish energy&quot; and screenwriters Ahlert&#x27;s and Drake&#x27;s &quot;canny cocktail of period vernacular and deliberately labored double entendres&quot;, finding the movie &quot;intelligent and amusing&quot; with &quot;a glorious, hectic artificiality&quot;. But he questioned &quot;the point of the exercise&quot; compared with Todd Haynes&#x27; &quot;Far from Heaven&quot;, which &quot;plunged into the subtext of those old movies&quot;, whereas &quot;Down with Love&quot;, being an &quot;updating and a critique&quot;, &quot;snips that subtext away&quot;, making it &quot;less sophisticated than what it imitates&quot;.

Conversely, &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; Mick LaSalle wrote, &quot;&quot;Down With Love&quot; is superior to &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;&quot;, which &quot;seems naive in comparison&quot; because &quot;&quot;Down with Love&quot; is a very smart, very shrewd movie, and the smartest, shrewdest thing about it is the way it masquerades as just a fluffy comedy, a diversion, a trifle. Hardly a trifle, &quot;Down With Love&quot; distills 40 years of sexual politics into 100 minutes, using the romantic-comedy conventions of an earlier time to comment on the governing social assumptions of yesterday—and today, as well... The brilliance of &quot;Down With Love&quot; is that it slyly reminds us that our modern perspective, like every &#x27;modern perspective&#x27; that preceded it, is doomed to obsolescence and isn&#x27;t some final stage of enlightened social thought.&quot;

Opposing opinions occurred even at the same newspaper, as with &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, where Rex Reed&#x27;s review was headlined &quot;Down With Down With Love!&quot; but Andrew Sarris&#x27;s headline countered with &quot;It&#x27;s Affectionate and Smart, And I&#x27;m Down With Love&quot;.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; admired Orlandi&#x27;s costumes and Laws&#x27; design for their &quot;giddily precise exaggeration&quot; and wrote that the script &quot;has a gentle heart to humanize its sharp sitcom wit,&quot; advising his readers to &quot;stay for the movie&#x27;s denouement: a two-minute speech that wraps up the plot like Christmas ribbons around a time bomb&quot;. But he found the film to be &quot;miscast at the top&quot; and &quot;conflicted about its subject—it both derides and adores what it means to parody&quot; and that director &quot;Reed often uses a gong where chimes would do.&quot; Corliss concludes: &quot;As you see, we too are conflicted about this film. We want to love it, but like a Rock Hudson rake, we keep finding fault in its allure. We want to hate it, but like Doris Day, we finally can&#x27;t say no&quot;.

In the years after its release, Nathan Rabin, Jonathan Rosenbaum, and Richard Brody have been among the critics and film theorists that have continued to write in praise of the film. Rabin wrote that Chicago critics by and large embraced &quot;Down With Love&quot;, noting: &quot;It got two thumbs up from Ebert &amp; Roeper and was No. 2 on Rosenbaum’s Top 10 list in the Chicago Reader.&quot; Rosenbaum called it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and wrote, &quot;If a more interesting and entertaining Hollywood movie than &quot;Down with Love&quot; has come along this year, I&#x27;ve missed it&quot;.

&quot;Down with Love&quot; holds a 60% approval rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 179 critics, with an average rating of 6.10/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Looks great, but Zellweger and McGregor have no chemistry together, and the self-satisfied, knowing tone grates&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100 based on 39 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In August 2018, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; put &quot;Down With Love&quot; at Number 13 on their list of the top &quot;25 Best Romantic Comedies of All Time&quot;. In June 2017, Jonathan Rosenbaum named &quot;Down With Love&quot; one of his &quot;25 Favorite Films of the 21st Century (so far)&quot;. In 2023, Beatrice Loayza of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of the film’s cult following, saying &quot;its meta-referential charms&quot; have been embraced by a &quot;younger generation…that better understands the role-playing nature of gender and romantic courtship…The film mocks, but it also transports with its eye-candy visuals and coy performances, reminding us that a suspension of reason is required to perform gender, to be sucked into a rom-com and, even, to fall in love.&quot;

==Music==
The film&#x27;s title comes from the song &quot;Down with Love&quot; as sung by Judy Garland, who is seen singing it on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in one scene.

The song &quot;Here&#x27;s to Love&quot; sung by Zellweger and McGregor during the closing credits (and in its entirety on the DVD release as a special feature) was a last-minute addition to the film. Songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman appear in the number as the bartender and the pianist. According to the DVD commentary, it was added at the suggestion of McGregor, who pointed out the opportunity the filmmakers had to unite the stars of two recently popular musical films (his &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; and Zellweger&#x27;s &quot;Chicago&quot;).

The songs &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot; and &quot;For Once in My Life&quot;, sung by Michael Bublé, previously appeared on Bublé&#x27;s 2003 self-titled album.

<text>The Red Wing (or Aerodrome #1) was an early aircraft designed by Thomas Selfridge and built by the Aerial Experiment Association in 1908. It was named for the bright red color of its silk wings — chosen to achieve the best result with the photographic materials and techniques of the day.

On 12 March 1908 Frederick W. Baldwin piloted the aircraft off the frozen Keuka Lake near Hammondsport, New York in what would be the first public demonstration of a powered aircraft flight in the United States as well as the first flight by a Canadian pilot.

Contemporary accounts described the flight as the &quot;First Public Trip of Heavier-than-air Car in America.&quot; Reports entitled &quot;Views of an Expert&quot; stated that Professor Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s new machine, the Red Wing, built from plans by Lieutenant Selfridge, was &quot;shown to be practicable by flight over Keuka Lake, Hammondsport, New York, 12 March 1908 by F. W. Baldwin, the engineer in charge of its construction.&quot;

The aircraft covered 319 ft (97 m) at a height of around 20 ft (6 m). This was said to be the longest &quot;first flight&quot; by either an aircraft or a pilot, up to that date. On March 17 Baldwin attempted a second flight, also from the ice of Keuka Lake, before crashing 20 seconds after takeoff. A portion of the tail gave way, bringing the test to an end. The Red Wing was damaged beyond repair.

<doc id="1028912" wikidata="Q1770796" url="?curid=1028912" title="Saint George, Antigua and Barbuda">
<text>Saint George (), officially the Parish of Saint George, is a parish of Antigua and Barbuda on the island of Antigua. Saint George borders Saint Peter to the southeast, and Saint John to the west and south. Saint George is mostly farmland and savanna in the south, dense forest in the Blackman&#x27;s Peninsula area, marshland in the Fitches Creek area, and dense forest in the northwest. It is the smallest parish in Antigua and Barbuda, and the parish capital is Fitches Creek. The largest city in the parish is Piggotts. Saint George is the newest parish, splitting from the parish of Saint Peter in 1725. It had an estimated population of 8,817 in 2018.

Saint George is the most prosperous parish in the country, with the communities of Fitches Creek and Coolidge being classified as one of the six neighbourhoods in the country to have high-income status in 2008. The neighbourhoods of Fitches Creek, Coolidge, Airport all had the top fifteen living conditions indexes in 2008. Saint George&#x27;s prosperity has been the result of having one of the most modern airports in the Caribbean, V. C. Bird International Airport, the headquarters of the Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force, Camp Blizzard, multiple universities such as the American University of Antigua and the Antigua and Barbuda International Institute of Technology, the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, and the former Antigua Air Station. This economic prosperity is spread throughout the parish, with both the northern region of the parish, and the southern region, having important and modern facilities.

Long Island and Maiden Island are legally parts of the parish of Saint George, however, statistically, the three residents on Long Island in 2011 were counted as living in Saint Peter, and politically, Long Island and Maiden Island are sometimes considered parts of the St. Peter constituency.

Saint George does not have many tourist attractions and beaches, and instead generates much of its revenue from the V.C. Bird International Airport, the only airport in Antigua, and the 20,000-capacity Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium, which co-hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Due to the many international universities hosted in Saint George, Saint George has a large international student population. Due to Saint George hosting Antigua&#x27;s only airport, Saint George also hosts the only air-links into Barbuda and Montserrat.

The Division of New North Sound, which is now the only division in Saint George, split from Saint Peter with the primary objective of providing for their parish church and having their own parish vestry. Historically, the majority of the parish&#x27;s lands were used for agricultural purposes. Numerous historical relics from the parish can still be seen today, including the Blackman&#x27;s and Judge Blizzard&#x27;s plantations.

== History ==

=== Archaic age and ceramic age in Winthrope&#x27;s Bay ===
From the earliest days of colonization, pre-Columbian peoples made extensive use of Winthorpe&#x27;s Bay. There are patches of Archaic Age flakes and lithic debitage scattered over many kilometers of the waterfront, together with deposits of shellfish, which are the leftovers of prehistoric meals. In 1997, a shoreline archaeological survey was carried out. Three sites from the Ceramic Age were identified and examined during this search. One meter below the surface, Saladoid pottery was found in GE-06 (Winthorpe&#x27;s West). But the site is essentially a post-Saladoid site. The second and biggest site is GE-01, a sizable post-Saladoid and Archaic munti-component site (Winthorpe&#x27;s East). Here was found a lithic workshop, or flint processing facility. There were two archeological excavations in 1997 and 2002. Barnacle Point, and the Archaic sites, GE-9 and 10, were destroyed by land development in the summer of 2003. Studies in this field are ongoing.

=== Colonial period ===
The parish of Saint George was created on 22 January 1725 after &quot;An Act for dividing the Parish of Saint Peter in the said Island; and for erecting a new Parish, to be called the Parish of Saint George&quot; passed the Assembly on 10 January 1725, and the Council on the same day. The parish was created due to the parish of Saint Peter being too large to support the parish of Saint George. The parish was governed by twelve vestry-men.

During the times of slavery, Saint George was divided into twenty-two slave plantations.

=== World War II and U.S. interest ===
The United States sought to establish an Army Air Base at Coolidge, Saint George, and a Naval Air Station at Crabbs, Saint Peter. The U.S. flag was hoisted on 21 March 1941, even though the Antigua agreement was not signed until 28 May and the entire lease agreement not until 27 March 1941. Even earlier, on 4 February, work had started building the Naval Air Station, and on 17 March, a detachment of fifty Marines, the first American military personnel, arrived. On 13 May, construction on the bigger Army Air Base started. The settlement of Winthorpes and the MacDonalds&#x27; estate house at High Point were included in the borders of the region selected for the Army base, which was primarily made up of canefield, scrub, and mango swamp.

Construction on the base did not conclude until the spring of 1942, in part due to the lengthy process of relocating the village and its residents. However, both bases had started up immediately using makeshift facilities, with the first plane landing at Coolidge on 6 June 1941, and the first seaplane arriving at Crabbs, Saint Peter on 25 June. When the air bases diminished in importance, the army air base was converted into the Coolidge Airport, later renamed the V.C. Bird International Airport.

== Geography ==

Saint George is mostly flat, being dominated by grasslands in the south, marshland in the centre, and forest in the north. Much of the sea floor surrounding the parish is home to seagrass patches. There are many creek systems in the southern region of the parish. There is a salt pond in the northern region, and various small water bodies in the south. In 1891, Saint George was very well connected by Antigua&#x27;s historic rail infrastructure. The parish is mostly part of Antigua&#x27;s limestone region. The northern region has a very right drought risk and the southern region has a low drought risk. All of the coastline is part of the Northeast Marine Management Area. The parish has some marine sand coverage, many coral reef communities, and many mangrove wetlands.

<text>Saint Philip (), officially the Parish of Saint Philip, is a civil parish of Antigua and Barbuda, on the easternmost portion of Antigua island. Its capital is the village of St. Philip&#x27;s. Saint Philip borders Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Saint Philip faces the Atlantic Ocean. Saint Philip is surrounded by various islands and islets. It had an estimated population of 3,689 in 2018, which makes it the least populous parish of Antigua and Barbuda.

Saint Philip is known for its good shore snorkeling in the Half Moon Bay area. While Saint Philip is a civil administrative division, the Anglican parish church is located in the village of St. Phillip&#x27;s. Saint Philip is often considered to be the most isolated parish on the island, due to its isolated location from the main urban areas, and its low population density.

== History ==
Saint Philip was created in August 1681, when Antigua was divided into five parishes. Saint Philip and the four other parishes were permanently established in July 1692, and confirmed in January 1693. The primary objective of the establishment of parishes was providing for the parish church.

Like most other parishes on Antigua, in its early colonial history, it was often dominated by the sugar industry, with some regions having smaller industries of cavalier rum, cattle, and muscovado sugar. Saint Philip had over 36 sugar mills during the sugarcane era.

<text>Eva Clayton (née McPherson; born September 16, 1934) is an American politician from North Carolina. On taking her seat in the United States House of Representatives following a special election in 1992, Clayton became the first African American to represent North Carolina in the House since George Henry White was elected to his second and last term in 1898. She was re-elected and served for five terms. In 2003, Clayton was appointed Assistant Director-General of the United Nations&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), based in Rome.

==Early life and education==
Eva McPherson was born in Savannah, Georgia to Thomas McPherson, an insurance agent, and Josephine Martin, a teacher. Clayton graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1955. In 1956, she married Theaoseus Clayton, also a graduate of Johnson C. Smith University.

Eva and Theaoseus Clayton both pursued graduate degrees at North Carolina Central University following their marriage. Eva graduated with a Master of Science degree from in Durham, North Carolina in 1962.

The Claytons moved to Warrenton, North Carolina, where Theaoseus established himself as a lawyer. Eva attended law school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Career==
In 1968, civil rights activist Vernon Jordan, as part of his efforts to increase black political engagement, met with Theaoseus Clayton to recruit a black candidate for public officer in eastern North Carolina. Eventually, the two decided that Eva was the best choice, and later that year she unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Lawrence H. Fountain in North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district for his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Clayton worked on the Soul City community development project in Warren County, North Carolina. In 1977, she was appointed Assistant Secretary for Community Development for the North Carolina State Department of Natural Resources and Community Development and served from 1977 to 1981.

From 1982 to 1992, Clayton served as an elected member and chair of the Warren County Board of Commissioners. In 1992, she was elected from the 1st congressional district in North Carolina to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat; at the same time she won a special election to finish the remaining months in 1992 of the term of Congressman Walter B. Jones Sr.

North Carolina had amended its constitution in 1899 to disfranchise Blacks, as did most southern states from 1890 to 1908, and no Black candidates were elected to Congress in the succeeding 92 years. When Representative Walter Jones Sr., announced his retirement in 1992, Clayton entered the Democratic primary to fill his seat. Recently reapportioned by the state legislature, the congressional district was one of two in North Carolina that had a black majority In 1992. Clayton and Mel Watt became the first African Americans to win election to the House from North Carolina since 1898. (As Clayton won a special election, she took office before Watt). Watt&#x27;s 12th congressional district was one of two minority majority districts developed in the 1990s, in order to give the substantial minority of African Americans in the state the ability to elect candidates of their choice, in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Clayton gained national attention as president of her Democratic freshman class in Congress. During her ten years of distinguished service as a United States Congresswoman, Clayton served on the House Agriculture Committee and as the ranking member of the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Operations Oversight, Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittees. She also served on the House Budget and Small Business Committees. She was actively engaged in the legislative development of the Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Operation policy. She was a conferee on the 2002 Farm Bill and is recognized by national organizations, including the &quot;National Journal&quot; publications, for providing essential leadership by garnering support for nutritional programs and the civil rights and support for African American farmers in the final version of the Farm Bill. She provided additional leadership by serving as the bipartisan co-chair of the Rural Caucus and as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation.

Clayton and other members of the House of Representatives objected to counting the 25 electoral votes from Florida which George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount. Because no senator joined her objection, the objection was dismissed by Vice President Al Gore, who was Bush&#x27;s opponent in the 2000 presidential election. Without Florida&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In 2003, Clayton was appointed Assistant Director-General and Special Adviser to the Director-General on World Food Summit Follow-up with the Food Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in Rome, Italy. She served in that capacity for three years, in which she was responsible for encouraging the establishment of global alliances and partnerships to fight hunger and poverty in twenty-four different countries around the world, including the United States, Brazil, Ghana, and Jordan. Clayton remains a strong advocate for the hungry and the poor and she continuously promotes sustainable agriculture and equality in this country and around the world.

Clayton is currently a consultant and founder of &quot;Eva Clayton Associates International&quot; (ECAI), which describes itself as &quot;a multidisciplined consulting firm actively engaged in several governmental practice areas&quot;.

She is the recipient of eight honorary doctorate degrees and an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Clayton is an Elder at Cotton Memorial Presbyterian Church in Henderson, North Carolina. She serves on several boards that address hunger, agriculture and state policy issues, including the &quot;United States Alliance to End Hunger&quot;, the &quot;Global Food Banking Network&quot;, and the &quot;Center for Environmental Farming Systems&quot;.

In November 2022, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper awarded Clayton the 2022 North Carolina Award, the highest civilian honor given by the state.

Her husband Theaoseus T. Clayton Sr., Esq., died in 2019 at age 88. They have four children and six grandchildren.

<doc id="1028917" wikidata="Q1999872" url="?curid=1028917" title="Saint Mary, Antigua and Barbuda">
<text>Saint Mary (), officially the Parish of Saint Mary, is a parish of Antigua and Barbuda on the island of Antigua. Saint Mary borders Saint John to the north, and Saint Paul to the east. Saint Mary is dominated by the Shekerley Mountains, and its northern border is largely defined by the mountains, and by Cooks Creek. The largest city in the parish is Bolans, home to the Jolly Harbour neighbourhood, and the parish church is located in Old Road. Saint Mary was permanently established with the other four original parishes in 1692. It had an estimated population of 8,141 in 2018.

The only area in which the Antigua black pineapple can be produced is the Pineapple Belt, which includes Saint Mary. The settlements of Old Road and Urlings are located in the southern part of the parish, and Bolans and Jennings are located in the flat northern half of the parish, where the majority of Saint Mary&#x27;s population is concentrated. The Shekerley Mountains shield most of the parish&#x27;s land area from human population, leaving the remaining portion of the parish largely uninhabited. The remote community of John Hughes, which has less ties to the parish as a whole than to Swetes in Saint Paul, is one of the few settlements found inside the Sherkerley Mountains.

Saint Mary was created in August 1681, when Antigua was divided into five parishes. Saint Mary and the four other parishes were permanently established in July 1692, and confirmed in January 1693. The primary objective of the establishment of parishes was providing for the parish church. The majority of the parish&#x27;s agricultural lands, with the exception of the mountains, were formerly home to sugar mills. Numerous historical relics from the parish can still be seen today, including the Yorke&#x27;s and Sawcolt&#x27;s plantations. 

== History ==

=== Jolly Beach people ===
The Amerindian Jolly Beach site is the most well-known example of a fully intact archaic habitation site, dating back to the earliest period of human occupation in Antigua and Barbuda. The site was inhabited between 3,500 and 4,000 years ago, according to two radiocarbon dates from 1,775 and 1,589 BC. The term &quot;archaic age&quot; refers to a time when agricultural practices and pottery production were not even possible due to a lack of technological advancements. The Jolly Beach inhabitants have subsisted on a variety of local vegetation and marine resources. They used wood, flint, shell, and volcanic stone as their tool materials. Similar tools have been discovered in South America, suggesting that the Jolly Beach people originated there. As opposed to the later Tainos and Island Caribs who were spotted by the European missionaries and explorers, it is unknown the name of the tribe who resided there or the language they spoke.

=== Ceramic period ===
One of the locations of the earliest European settlements in Antigua is acknowledged to be Cades Bay. Nestled in the lee of the Sherkerley Mountains, this lush coastal plain is shielded by a substantial barrier reef. The most notable pre-Columbian archaeological deposit is from the early Ceramic Age (Arawak) Saladoid period, despite signs of Archaic Age occupation. The land is currently utilized for pineapple farming, which has caused significant disturbance. Nevertheless, during the ploughing sessions, important discoveries were made.

=== British period ===
On 24 August 1681, Saint Mary&#x27;s parish was founded. The parish was divided into three divisions in 1749: Old Road Division, Bermudian Valley Division, and New Division. The Johnsons Point, Crabs Hill, Urlings, and Old Road area, which is in the southern part of the parish, makes up the Old Road Division. Jolly Harbour and a portion of Bolans make up the majority of the Bermudian Valley Division. Most of the flat areas of the parish were located in New Division, which dominated the parish&#x27;s northern area. There were more than twenty-nine slave plantations in Saint Mary.

== Geography ==
Boggy Peak, formerly known as Mount Obama, is the highest point in both the parish and Antigua and Barbuda. Although the parish is dominated by the Shekerley Mountains, most of its people live either along the shore or in the district&#x27;s northern, flatter area, which is home to Bolands, the parish capital. Because of the area&#x27;s unique rainfall patterns and long history in agriculture, Saint Mary and Saint Paul are the primary locations for the cultivation of the Antigua Black Pineapple, which is thought to be the sweetest pineapple in the world. The parish&#x27;s northern, flatter portion contains the majority of its streams. The parish is home to some of the biggest wetlands and bodies of water, including Yorks Salt Pond, Wallings Reservoir, The Flashes, and Jolly Hill Salt Pond. Similar to Saint Paul, the parish includes few islands.

<text>Saint Paul (), officially the Parish of Saint Paul, is a parish of Antigua and Barbuda on the island of Antigua. It had an estimated population of 9,004 in 2018. The parish capital, and the location of the parish church, is Falmouth. The main economic and tourism hub of the parish is English Harbour. 

Saint Paul borders Saint Peter and Saint John to the north, Saint Mary to the west, and Saint Philip to the east. Saint Paul is dominated by farmland in the north, with various creeks and Potworks Dam marking its northern border, and low-lying hills to the south, defining its western border with Saint Mary. The largest city fully within the parish is Liberta, the third largest city in the country. Saint Paul was permanently established with the other four original parishes in 1692.

Saint Paul is mostly dominated by tourism and agriculture, with most settlement in the parish being based around Tyrells Main Road and Matthews Road. The northeastern portion of the parish is very sparsely populated with the only settlement in this region being Bethesda. The eastern coast of the parish along Willoughby Bay also has a very low population, with little exception. Saint Paul has very few islands, but many peninsulas.

Saint Paul is a major tourism hub on the island. Saint Paul is different from the rest of Antigua as it is not a major hub for beach tourism, due to its very few &quot;clear water&quot; beaches. Most tourism activity centres around yachting, restaurants, and hotels. Saint Paul is home to many amenities and facilities that would only be seen in St. John&#x27;s City, due to its tourism and yachting importance. Saint Paul is home to English Harbour and Falmouth Harbour, some of the most important harbours in the country. Saint Paul is home to many marinas, one of the only ports of entry in the country, and a station of the Antigua and Barbuda Coast Guard.

Saint Paul was created in August 1681, when Antigua was divided into five parishes. Saint Paul and the four other parishes were permanently established in July 1692, and confirmed in January 1693. The primary objective of the establishment of parishes was providing for the parish church. A large portion of the parish&#x27;s lands were used for agricultural purposes. Numerous historical relics from the parish can still be seen today, including the Savannah and Guinea Bush plantations.

== History ==
There are numerous historic communities in Saint Paul, the majority of which are concentrated around English Harbour and Falmouth, which are located in the parish&#x27;s southern region. 

=== Naval history of English Harbour ===
=== History of Liberta ===
The first village established following emancipation was Liberta. The community was founded in 1834 and was given the name &quot;Liberty&quot;. The community was founded due to many liberated Black Antiguans having an interest in land ownership. Owners charged $30 for 30 by 50-foot property lots. Many built two-room houses. The Hamlet, a cluster of houses close to Liberta that was formerly part of the Tyrells property, was eventually absorbed into Liberta after 1842.

=== History of Falmouth ===
Falmouth was the first part of Antigua to be settled by the British, in 1632. Governor Warner resided close to Falmouth Bay by 1640. The village was settled by English people. Falmouth was the same size of the rising St. John&#x27;s City in 1689.

== Geography ==
Most of the population of the parish is in the western half along the Tyrells Main Road and Matthews Road, and in the English Harbour/Falmouth area. The only village in the eastern half of the parish is Bethesda. Most of the inhabited areas of the parish are very hilly, and most of the uninhabited areas are dense forest or are flat agricultural lands. The parish is separated from the rest of the island by various small creeks that mark the parishes northern border. The parish is also home to many ponds, including one of the largest water bodies in the country, Potworks Dam. The northeastern half of the parish was home to much of Antigua&#x27;s historic rail infrastructure in 1891. The southern coast of the parish is dominated by many coral reefs.

<text>Saint Peter (), officially the Parish of Saint Peter, is a parish of Antigua and Barbuda on the island of Antigua. Saint Peter borders Saint Paul to the south, Saint Philip to the east, and Saint George and Saint John to the west. Saint Peter is dominated by farmland, savanna, and undeveloped fields, and its borders are not well-defined. The largest city fully within the parish is Parham, which is also the capital. However, the portion of the city of All Saints in Saint Peter is significantly larger than Parham. Saint Peter was created with the other four original parishes in 1692. It had an estimated population of 5,706 in 2018.

Saint Peter is mostly dominated by agriculture and industry, with the few populated places in the parish being portions of All Saints, Diamonds, Freemans, Pares, Parham, and Vernons. Most of the parish lives on the western border with Saint John. Pares is the only major settlement in the center of the parish. There is almost no settlement in the eastern portion of the parish other than the hamlets of Coconut Hall and Gilberts. In the northern areas of the parish, Saint Peter is home to Guiana Island and the Galley Islands, as well as the Crabbs Peninsula. Long Island, home to three permanent inhabitants, and Maiden Island are legally part of Saint George, but are politically and statistically part of Saint Peter. Long Island and Maiden Island are counted as parts of Saint Peter for purposes of the census.

Saint Peter is not home to many tourist attractions, and the mainland portion of the parish is home to very few, if any beaches. Parham Harbour is sometimes used by local residents, specifically children, for swimming. Saint Peter is however home to many historic Amerindian villages, and the Betty&#x27;s Hope sugar plantation, one of the major symbols of the island. Saint Peter also has populations of European fallow deer on Guiana Island. On the offshore islands, there are many clear waters and reefs, and many of the offshore islands, like Great Bird Island, are frequented by tourists.

Saint Peter was created in August 1681, when Antigua was divided into five parishes. Saint Peter and the four other parishes were permanently established in July 1692, and confirmed in January 1693. The primary objective of the establishment of parishes was providing for the parish church. The majority of the parish&#x27;s lands were, and still are, used for agricultural purposes. Numerous historical relics from the parish can still be seen today, including the Mercer&#x27;s Creek and Coconut Hall plantations.

== History ==

=== Amerindian presence ===
Twenty Hill, which is located in Parham, and Jolly Beach, which is located in Jolly Bay, are the two locations in Antigua that hold the distinction of being the earliest and most significant sites of human occupation (c.1775 BC).

=== British period ===
On 24 August 1681, the parish of Saint Peter was founded. Saint Peter was originally composed of the divisions of New North Sound Division, Old North Sound Division, and Mercers Creek Division. However, New North Sound split off to form its own parish, Saint George, in 1725. According to a map published in 1782, the parish had a small pond named Pinns Pond, and a small church near Pares. There were 27 slave plantations in the parish.

== Geography ==
Although the parish is mostly flat and suitable for habitation, most of the population lives in the dense eastern cities on the western border. Very few localities are located outside of this region. The parish is home to most of the country&#x27;s minor islands, and the parish is home to many creeks and bays. Most of the creeks are near the parish&#x27;s borders. Most of the parish&#x27;s water bodies are located in the southeastern portion of the parish, with Potworks Dam, shared with Saint Paul, being the largest. The parish is enclosed by many of Antigua&#x27;s historic rail infrastructure.

== Demographics ==
Saint Peter is not a particularly diverse parish. In 2011, the parish had 5,317 people.

<text>Saint John (), officially the Parish of Saint John, is a civil parish of Antigua and Barbuda, on the northwestern portion of Antigua island. Its capital is the city of St. John&#x27;s. Saint John borders Saint Mary, Saint Peter, Saint George, and Saint Paul. Saint John faces the Caribbean Sea. Saint John is surrounded by some of Antigua&#x27;s most premier beaches. Saint John had a population of 56,736 in a 2018 estimate, making it home to the majority of the population in Antigua and Barbuda.

While Saint John is a civil administrative division, the Anglican parish church is located in the city of St. John&#x27;s. Saint John is mostly centered around the St. John&#x27;s urban area and the northern tourist area, but is also home to more rural areas in the southern salient and in the Five Islands-Yeptons area. Due to Saint John holding the majority of the population of Antigua and Barbuda, it is home to hundreds of populated locations some of which are vastly different from another. The island of Redonda is also under the administration of Saint John.

Saint John was created on 24 August 1681, when Antigua was divided into five parishes. Saint John and the four other parishes were permanently established in July 1692, and confirmed in January 1693. The primary objective of the establishment of parishes was providing for the parish church. Outside of the city, most of the rural areas of the parish were originally used as sugar mills. Many remnants of the parish&#x27;s past are still visible in the modern day, such as with the Cedar Valley Plantation, or the Weatherill&#x27;s plantation. 

== Demographics ==
== Governance ==

Saint John coincides with the boundaries of Magistrates&#x27; Court District &quot;A&quot;. While local government is nearly nonexistent in Antigua, there is a limited form of local government in the city centre of St. John&#x27;s, known as the Saint John&#x27;s Development Corporation. As the country&#x27;s primary political and cultural hub, Saint John is granted significantly more autonomy than the other parishes, with various governmental offices belonging exclusively to the parish. Historically, when village councils were active, there were proposals to create village councils in Potters, Cedar Grove, Five Islands, and St. Johnston and Clare Hall. A village council in the city of All Saints, which extends across three parishes, was also constituted.

==Education==
Island Academy International, the sole international school in the country, is located in the town of Buckleys within Saint John Parish. It was formerly Oliver&#x27;s Estate Island Academy.

<doc id="1028926" wikidata="Q2305951" url="?curid=1028926" title="Architectural acoustics">
<text>Architectural acoustics (also known as building acoustics) is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building and is a branch of acoustical engineering. The first application of modern scientific methods to architectural acoustics was carried out by the American physicist Wallace Sabine in the Fogg Museum lecture room. He applied his newfound knowledge to the design of Symphony Hall, Boston.

Architectural acoustics can be about achieving good speech intelligibility in a theatre, restaurant or railway station, enhancing the quality of music in a concert hall or recording studio, or suppressing noise to make offices and homes more productive and pleasant places to work and live in. Architectural acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.

== Building skin envelope ==
This science analyzes noise transmission from building exterior envelope to interior and vice versa. The main noise paths are roofs, eaves, walls, windows, door and penetrations. Sufficient control ensures space functionality and is often required based on building use and local municipal codes. An example would be providing a suitable design for a home which is to be constructed close to a high volume roadway, or under the flight path of a major airport, or of the airport itself.

== Inter-space noise control ==
The science of limiting and/or controlling noise transmission from one building space to another to ensure space functionality and speech privacy. The typical sound paths are ceilings, room partitions, acoustic ceiling panels (such as wood dropped ceiling panels), doors, windows, flanking, ducting and other penetrations. Technical solutions depend on the source of the noise and the path of acoustic transmission, for example noise by steps or noise by (air, water) flow vibrations. An example would be providing suitable party wall design in an apartment complex to minimize the mutual disturbance due to noise by residents in adjacent apartments.

Inter-space noise control can take a different form when talking about Acoustics in European football stadiums. One goal in stadium acoustics is to make the crowd as loud as possible and inter-space noise control becomes a factor but in helping reflect noise to create more reverberation and louder decibel level throughout the stadium. Many outdoor soccer stadiums for example have roofs over the fan sections which create more reverberation and echoing which helps raise the general volume in the stadium.

== Interior space acoustics ==

 This is the science of controlling a room&#x27;s surfaces based on sound absorbing and reflecting properties. Excessive reverberation time, which can be calculated, can lead to poor speech intelligibility.
Sound reflections create standing waves that produce natural resonances that can be heard as a pleasant sensation or an annoying one. Reflective surfaces can be angled and coordinated to provide good coverage of sound for a listener in a concert hall or music recital space. To illustrate this concept consider the difference between a modern large office meeting room or lecture theater and a traditional classroom with all hard surfaces.
Interior building surfaces can be constructed of many different materials and finishes. Ideal acoustical panels are those without a face or finish material that interferes with the acoustical infill or substrate. Fabric covered panels are one way to heighten acoustical absorption. Perforated metal also shows sound absorbing qualities. Finish material is used to cover over the acoustical substrate. Mineral fiber board, or Micore, is a commonly used acoustical substrate. Finish materials often consist of fabric, wood or acoustical tile. Fabric can be wrapped around substrates to create what is referred to as a &quot;pre-fabricated panel&quot; and often provides good noise absorption if laid onto a wall.

Prefabricated panels are limited to the size of the substrate ranging from to . Fabric retained in a wall-mounted perimeter track system, is referred to as &quot;on-site acoustical wall panels&quot;. This is constructed by framing the perimeter track into shape, infilling the acoustical substrate and then stretching and tucking the fabric into the perimeter frame system. On-site wall panels can be constructed to accommodate door frames, baseboard, or any other intrusion. Large panels (generally, greater than ) can be created on walls and ceilings with this method. Wood finishes can consist of punched or routed slots and provide a natural look to the interior space, although acoustical absorption may not be great.

There are four ways to improve workplace acoustics and solve workplace sound problems – the ABCDs.
*A = Absorb (via drapes, carpets, ceiling tiles, etc.)
*B = Block (via panels, walls, floors, ceilings and layout)
*C = Cover-up, or Control (background sound levels and spectra) (via masking sound)
*D = Diffuse (cause the sound energy to spread by radiating in many directions)

== Mechanical equipment noise ==
Building services noise control is the science of controlling noise produced by:
*HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) systems
*Elevators
*Electrical generators positioned within or attached to a building
*Any other building service infrastructure component that emits sound.

Inadequate control may lead to elevated sound levels within the space which can be annoying and reduce speech intelligibility. Typical improvements are vibration isolation of mechanical equipment, and sound attenuators in ductwork. Sound masking can also be created by adjusting HVAC noise to a predetermined level.

<doc id="1028927" wikidata="Q1324167" url="?curid=1028927" title="Kings Cross, New South Wales">
<text>Kings Cross is an inner-eastern locality of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is located approximately 2 kilometres east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Sydney. It is bounded by the suburbs of Potts Point, Elizabeth Bay, Rushcutters Bay and Darlinghurst.

Colloquially known as &quot;The Cross&quot;, the area was once known for its music halls and grand theatres. It was rapidly transformed after World War II by the influx of troops returning and visiting from the nearby Garden Island naval base. It became known as Sydney&#x27;s night entertainment and red-light district, earning the nickname &quot;Sin City&quot;; however, many nightclubs, bars and adult entertainment venues closed due to the Sydney lockout laws. Today, it is a mixed locality offering services such as a railway station, gyms, supermarkets and bakeries as well as entertainment venues including bars, restaurants, nightclubs, brothels and strip clubs.

== History ==

=== British settlement ===
The intersection of William Street, Darlinghurst Road and Victoria Street at the locality&#x27;s southernmost limit was named Queen&#x27;s Cross to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee in 1897. Confusion with Queen&#x27;s Square in King Street in the city prompted its renaming as Kings Cross, after King Edward VII, in 1905.

During the early 19th century the Darlinghurst area, which extended to include current day Kings Cross, was one of Sydney&#x27;s most prestigious locations, being far enough to escape the noise and smell of the central city but close enough for easy travel. An additional attraction was the commanding harbour views to the east and north and (from some points) views to the west as far as the Blue Mountains.

In 1828, the Governor of New South Wales Sir Ralph Darling subdivided the area, then known as Woolloomooloo Hill, into large allotments which he granted seventeen estates to favoured subordinates and leading businessmen. They built a series of grandiose mansions with sprawling gardens of up to ten acres (4 ha). The remnants of these gardens helped give the area its leafy character, and many of the mansions are commemorated through street names such as Roslyn, Orwell and Kellett. Most of the grand estates were ultimately subdivided with all but a handful of the great houses demolished. One of the surviving homes, located nearby in the suburb of Elizabeth Bay, is Elizabeth Bay House, a quintessential example of Australian colonial architecture. Others, now used for other purposes, include Tusculum in Manning Street and Rockwall. A prominent past resident of this era was David Scott Mitchell.

=== Early Subdivision Plans ===
The estates that Governor Darling granted to the emerging merchant class and professional elite shaped the development of the area that came to be known as Kings Cross. The mansions built on these estates such as Tusculum remain today as leading examples of architectural design in colonial Australia.

Subdivision plans also known as estate maps were produced from the mid-19th to mid-20th century and advertised estates and subdivisions of land for sale. They illustrate the urban development of Sydney as large estates were divided up and transformed into the suburbs of Sydney.

The estates and mansions are commemorated through street names such as Roslyn, Orwell and Kellett, as documented in the gallery of subdivision maps.

=== Bohemian district ===
The Kings Cross district was Sydney&#x27;s bohemian heartland from the early decades of the 20th century. The illegal trading of alcohol, known as &quot;sly grog&quot;, was notorious in the area up until mid-century, led by rival brothel owners, Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh. For most of the 1900s, the &quot;Cross&quot; was an entertainment centre which hosted numerous clubs and cafes as well as the Kings Cross Theatre, one of Sydney&#x27;s earliest movie houses. The area was also home to a large number of artists, including writers, poets and journalists such as Kenneth Slessor, Christopher Brennan, Hal Porter, George Sprod and Dame Mary Gilmore, entrepreneur Mayfield B. Anthony, actors including Peter Finch and Chips Rafferty, and painters Sir William Dobell and Rosaleen Norton.
From the 1960s onwards, Kings Cross also came to serve as both the city&#x27;s main tourist accommodation and entertainment mecca, as well as its red-light district. It thereby achieved a high level of notoriety out of all proportion to its limited geographical extent. Hundreds of American servicemen on &quot;R &amp; R&quot; (rest and recreation) leave flocked to the area each week in search of entertainment. Organised crime and police corruption were well entrenched in the area – one of Sydney&#x27;s most notorious illegal casinos operated with impunity for many years, although it was known to all and located only yards from Darlinghurst police station. Much of this activity can be related with Abe Saffron, commonly known as Mr Sin or &quot;the boss of the Cross&quot;.

A positive influence in the area during that time was the Wayside Chapel, run by Rev Ted Noffs. His church was open most of the time, providing a &quot;drop in centre&quot; and counselling services to many of the itinerants who were drawn to the area. The Ted Noffs Foundation Inc, established in 1971, continues his work supporting young people and their families who are experiencing drug and alcohol problems and related trauma.

Juanita Nielsen, a journalist and publisher, campaigned against property development in the Kings Cross area during the 1970s until her sudden disappearance on 4 July 1975. A coronial inquest determined that Nielsen had been murdered, and although the case has never been officially solved, it is widely believed that Nielsen was killed by agents of the developers. Some of the projects she campaigned against were delayed, halted or modified due to a combination of community campaigns and green bans placed by the NSW Builders Labourers Federation.

As a celebration to commemorate the Stonewall Riots, the inaugural Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras pro-gay rights protest march was held on the evening of 24 June 1978. After the protest march, participants were subject to police harassment in Hyde Park, following the revocation of the original protest permit. Some participants headed to Kings Cross where police arrested 53 people, although most of the charges were later dropped.

Australia&#x27;s first widely known transgender person, Carlotta, rose to prominence in Kings Cross whilst working in cabaret at Les Girls, The Tender Trap, and her appearance on soap opera Number 96.

From the late 1960s, drug-related crime was one of the area&#x27;s main social problems. In 2001, despite controversy, Australia&#x27;s first Medically Supervised Injecting Centre was established (where users of illegal drugs can inject themselves at a safe injection site in clean conditions) at a shopfront site in Kings Cross. The injecting room is credited with reducing the occurrence of fatal overdoses in the injecting drug user community, as well as reducing the number of needles left in the street, with an interim evaluation report in 2007 claiming:

The reduction in opioid-related overdoses was much more substantial in the immediate vicinity of the MSIC than in other neighbouring areas. ... Counts of discarded needles and syringes collected locally indicated a decrease of around 50% following the establishment of the service.

=== Today ===
Today, the ongoing operation of tourist accommodation, the proximity to social housing and health care, and the convenient public transport to the city result in a diverse population, both resident and passing through at Kings Cross. Since the introduction of controversial lockout laws in March 2014 several nightclubs and pubs in the area have closed down. In February 2021, the NSW government announced the end of lockout laws in March 2021 hoping to revitalise the area.

== Heritage listings ==

Kings Cross has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Macleay Street: El Alamein Memorial Fountain.
* Darlinghurst Road: Bourbon &amp; Beefsteak building façade, Kingsley Hall building, and the Empire Hotel.

==Landmarks==

* The El Alamein Fountain is at the entrance to the Fitzroy Gardens on the corner of Darlingurst Road and Macleay Street was commissioned as a memorial to soldiers who died in 1942 during World War II in two battles at El Alamein, Egypt. It was designed in 1961 by the New Zealand-born architect Robert Woodward. Its dandelion design, which has since been copied for fountains around the world, was Woodward&#x27;s original design.
* The Coca-Cola billboard, which has since been turned off and replaced in 2016 with a new sign. Pieces of the original sign were auctioned off on eBay with proceeds going to the Wayside Chapel.
* The Fire Station at the intersection of Darlinghurst Road and Victoria Street was designed by the Government Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon, and built from 1910 to 1912. It is an example of the Federation Free Style and is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.
* Kings Cross railway station is an underground railway station on the Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line of the Sydney Trains network.
* The Les Girls building, now known as the Empire Hotel, stood prominently on the corner of Darlinghurst Road and Roslyn Street, in the heart of the Cross. From 1963 until 1993 the building was home to the legendary Les Girls &quot;drag queen&quot; show, starring Carlotta. Throughout the 1990s the building, still retaining its original 1960s features, became the home to alternative cabaret, including the much-loved Sunday nightclub The Tender Trap.

==Culture==
Events and celebrations
* The Kings Cross Food and Wine Festival is a local annual event held in autumn by the Potts Point Partnership, a business action group.

Popular culture
* The television series &quot;Kings Cross ER: St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital&quot; prominently features medical emergencies that occur in Kings Cross and surrounding areas. The show frequently examines issues in Kings Cross such as violence, homelessness, prostitution, illicit drugs and gang-related incidents. The title was inaccurate as St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital is located in Darlinghurst.
* Kings Cross has made several appearances in popular Australian culture including Paul Kelly&#x27;s song &quot;From St Kilda to Kings Cross&quot; from the album &quot;Post&quot;.
* The 1999 Australian crime film &quot;Two Hands&quot; starring actor Heath Ledger was partly filmed in Kings Cross.
* Clare Werbeloff became known as the &quot;Kings Cross Bogan&quot; following her eyewitness account of a shooting outside a Kings Cross nightclub, which turned out to be a hoax. Her politically incorrect report to a television news cameraman spread online via YouTube and made her an internet celebrity. Afterwards she starred in a lingerie photo shoot for Ralph magazine and in several Australian television shows. She also starred in a photo shoot in a 2011 Spanish FHM magazine.
* The novel &quot;The Golden Day&quot; by Ursula Dubosarsky is set in a fictitious girls&#x27; school in Kings Cross and involves the disappearance of one of the teachers while on a school excursion in 1967.
* The novel &quot;Down in the City&quot; (1957) by Elizabeth Harrower is mostly set in Kings Cross.
* Justine Ettler&#x27;s &quot;The River Ophelia&quot;, a controversial 1995 novel, is believed to be set in King&#x27;s Cross though the location is never revealed in the book.
* The 1988 Australian film &quot;Tender Hooks&quot; is largely set in Kings Cross.
* Australian crime drama series &quot;&quot; was set in Kings Cross. It was a dramatic representation of Kings Cross organised crime in the 1980s and 1990s.
* The Australian television series &quot;Love Child&quot; was set in Kings Cross. It is a fictional drama series based on the lives of teenagers going through underage pregnancy during the 1960s.
* The Australian television series &quot;Les Norton&quot; was set in Kings Cross, as the lead character is a bouncer in a Kings Cross illegal gambling casino in 1985.
* Australian television series Last King of the Cross set in Kings Cross in the early years of John Ibrahim rise in Kings Cross and Oxford Street.
*A documentary titled &quot;The Rise &amp; Fall Of Kings Cross&quot; will air on Seven Network in 2025.

==Population==
As of 2019, it is estimated 4,948 people live within the locality&#x27;s area. In 2018, the local area (including Potts Point and Woolloomooloo) was recognised as the second most densely populated in Australia.

<text>Immenstaad am Bodensee is a municipality in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on the north shore of Lake Constance (called the &quot;Bodensee&quot; in German) near the Austrian and Swiss borders. It is not to be confused with the similarly named town of Immenstadt, approximately 85 km East in Bavaria.

==History==
The first documented reference to Immenstaad dates to the year 1094, when the Bavarian Duke Welf IV acquired the possessions of Weingarten Abbey. The controlling authorities were strongly factionalized until the Fürstenberg family bought the entire town in the late 18th century. In 1806 the town became a border town in the state of Baden-Württemberg.

Immenstaad am Bodensee was the home of the former Dornier aerospace company, which now is part of the Airbus. It is more famous as a popular resort and well known for its wine and fruit farming activities.

<text>ARN Regional is an Australian regional radio network founded after the purchase of a group of radio stations from Grant Broadcasters by ARN parent ARN Media. It includes a small number of metropolitan radio stations.

==History==
Grant Broadcasters was founded by Walter Grant in 1942 when he bought 2DU in Dubbo. In 1972 a shareholding in 2ST in Nowra was purchased followed in 1979 by 2PK in Parkes and in 1982 2MG in Mudgee. In 1986 2DU, 2PK and 2MG were sold with full ownership taken of 2ST. Over the next three decades, the company expanded through acquisition, purchasing radio stations in all states and territories of Australia, owning 53 stations by November 2021. In January 2022, Here, There &amp; Everywhere purchased 46 stations from Grant Broadcasters and integrated these into its ARN business. The deal was finalised on 4 January 2022.

<text>Thinocorus is a genus of seedsnipe, a South American family of small gregarious waders which have adapted to a vegetarian diet.

These birds look superficially like partridges in structure and bill shape. They have short legs and long wings. Their 2 or 3 eggs are laid in a shallow scrape on the ground.

&quot;Thinocorus&quot; contains the smaller two of the four seedsnipe species.

<text>Redfern railway station is a heritage-listed former railway bridge and now railway station located on the Main Suburban railway line in the Inner City Sydney suburb of Redfern in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by John Whitton and built by Department of Railways. It is also known as Redfern Railway Station group and Tenterfield railway. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The station that opened on 26 September 1855 is located on what was originally the Illawarra line. It is now served by all Sydney Trains lines except the Cumberland Line and the airport branch of the Airport &amp; South Line. Some NSW TrainLink Intercity services also call at the station.

==History==


===History of Redfern suburb===
Redfern&#x27;s natural landscape was defined by sand hills and swamps. The Carrahdigang, more widely known as the Cadigal people, valued the area for its abundant supply of food.

The name Redfern originates from an early land grant to William Redfern in 1817. It was previously known as Roberts Farm and Boxley&#x27;s Swamp. William Redfern (1774–1833) was a surgeon&#x27;s mate in the Royal Navy and was aboard HMS Standard when its crew took part in the revolt in 1797 known as the Mutiny of the Nore. Because he had advised the men to be more united, he was included among leaders who were court-martialled. Although sentenced to death, he was reprieved because of his youth and in 1801 arrived in Sydney as a convict. He served on Norfolk Island as an assistant surgeon. In 1803 he was pardoned, but remained on the island until 1808, when he returned to Sydney and was appointed assistant surgeon after being examined in medicine and surgery by Surgeons Jamison, Harris and Bohan.

In 1816, he took charge of the new Sydney Hospital, but maintained a private practice. In 1814 he reported on conditions on convict transport ships and his recommendation that all have a surgeon on board whose duties were to superintend the health of convicts was put into practice. He resigned from Government service in 1819 when not appointed to succeed D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth as principal surgeon. Despite his valuable service, many were contemptuous of him as he was an emancipist, although he had the friendship of Governor Macquarie. In 1818 Redfern received a grant of in Airds (in today&#x27;s Campbelltown area) and later received more land in the area and by his death in 1823 he owned, by grant and purchase, over in NSW.

In 1817, he had been granted in the area of the present suburb of Redfern. The boundaries were approximately the present-day Cleveland, Regent, Redfern and Elizabeth Streets. The commodious home Redfern built on his land was considered to be a country house, surrounded by flower and kitchen gardens. His neighbours were John Baptist (at the Darling Nursery in today&#x27;s Chippendale) and Captain Cleveland, an officer of the 73rd regiment, remembered by today&#x27;s street of that name, and before its demolition, by Cleveland House, his home.

The passing of the Sydney Slaughterhouses Act in 1849 brought other businesses to the district. This act banned abattoirs and noxious trades from the city. Tanners, wool scourers and wool-washers, fellmongers, boiling down works and abattoirs had ten years to move their businesses outside city boundaries. Many of the trades moved to Redfern and Waterloo - attracted by the water. The sand hills still existed but by the late 1850s Redfern was a flourishing suburb housing 6,500 people.

The Municipalities Act of 1858 gave districts the option of municipal incorporation. Public meetings were held and after a flurry of petitions Redfern Municipality was proclaimed on 11 August 1859, the fourth in Sydney to be formed under the Act. Redfern Town Hall opened in 1870 and the Albert Cricket Ground in 1864. Redfern Post Office came in 1882. The majority of houses in Redfern in the 1850s were of timber. From the 1850s market gardeners congregated in Alexandria south of McEvoy Street, around Shea&#x27;s Creek and Bourke Road.

Sydney&#x27;s original railway terminus was built in the Cleveland Paddocks, which extended from Devonshire and Cleveland Streets to Chippendale. All that remains of the Cleveland Paddocks is Prince Alfred Park, where the exhibition building was erected in 1870 for an inter-colonial exhibition opened by Governor Belmore, after whom Belmore Park was named, on 30 August 1870.

Redfern was the scene of the maiden trip of the first double-decker tram in 1879. It travelled between the old Redfern station to the corner of Hunter and Elizabeth Streets in the city. In 1885 the Sands Sydney Directory listed 54 market gardens. While many were worked by European-Australians, by the 1870s Chinese market gardeners had acquired leases in the district and a decade later were dominating the trade.

The Eveleigh complex in 1886 became one of the largest employers in the state. Redfern was an industrial working class suburb by the end of the 19th century. Reschs brewery and other factories attracted migrants. The Syrian/Lebanese community began settling around Redfern and Surry Hills by the 1880s.

===Redfern railway station===

In the early history of the New South Wales Government Railways, Redfern station was the frequently used but unofficial name of the principal Sydney terminus, a fact which has led to persistent confusion. That station, the first Sydney Terminal, was north of Cleveland Street, which is Redfern&#x27;s northern boundary, and south of Devonshire Street. It opened on 26 September 1855 in an area known as Cleveland Fields which is now the railway corridor called Sydney Yard. This original &#x27;Redfern&#x27; station comprised one wooden platform in a corrugated iron shed, with the station&#x27;s name honouring William Redfern. The station was built of iron and the first stationmaster was a Mr Fielding. As traffic increased the original station was replaced in 1874 by a brick and stone building containing two platforms. This second station, the second Sydney Terminal which grew to 14 platforms, was designed for through traffic if the lines were extended in the city direction. This second station was found to be too far from the city centre, so a new station (the present Sydney Central station) was built to the north of Devonshire Street and opened on 4 August 1906. The 1874 station was soon demolished.

A station was opened in 1876 west of the original Redfern and named Eveleigh, after an old home located on the western side of the railway line. In 1885 Eveleigh&#x27;s platforms were reconstructed at its present site, and was renamed Redfern on 21 October 1906, shortly after the current Central railway station was opened on the site of the former Devonshire Street cemetery.

Redfern station had been opened to serve the Eveleigh railway workshops, the first stage of which was completed in 1887, as well as the inner-city residential and industrial suburb of Redfern, one of Sydney&#x27;s most high-density residential areas. The name Eveleigh was retained for the railway workshops, just beyond the station, on the site of the original Hutchinson Estate, now part of the present suburb of Eveleigh. In 1894 there was a steam train collision at the station that resulted in eleven people being killed and several were injured including John Ralston

By the 1940s, three-quarters of Sydney factory workers worked within a three-mile radius of Redfern station, and many commuted to work by train.

The original station consisted of three island platforms serving four lines. The ticket office was located on the corner of Lawson Street and Rosehill Street, with stairs down to each individual platform. Rosehill Street was demolished to make way for the later expansion of Redfern station to the east, while the ticket office survived and was later extended.

The construction of the Redfern station was overseen by the office of John Whitton, engineer-in-chief of the NSW Railways. Whitton had been appointed in 1856 at the beginning of the NSW railway development and remained in the position until 1890, overseeing the establishment of the main body of the NSW system. The station was extended in 1891/92 to accommodate the quadruplication of the main suburban lines, with new platforms being built during this period (Platforms 5, 6 and 7) and again in 1919 (Platforms 8 and 9) and again in 1924/25 (Platform 10). In 1913 a footbridge was erected at the southern end of the platforms to allow access to the Eveleigh workshops from the station for the workers. The footbridge extended across all the platforms with stairs down to each.

On 1 August 1926, a further two platforms opened on the southern side (9 and 10) as part of the electrification of the Illawarra line. Work on underground platforms 11 and 12 began in the 1940s but did not finish until the 1970s when the Eastern Suburbs railway line was opened in 1979. The original plans of &quot;The City and Suburban Electric Railways (Amendment) Act&quot; of 1947 had included additional railway lines that were never completed, resulting in unfinished platforms and tunnels existing above the current platforms 11 and 12.

Until 1994, Redfern had an overhead footbridge at the Eveleigh end of the platforms, connecting platforms 1–10 by stairs. This was demolished because the funds for its maintenance were not available. In the southern footbridge was removed as the Eveleigh railway workshops were gradually closed down and the footbridge was no longer required.

In , the station underwent a major upgrade including the demolition of the northern footbridge and stairs to the platforms. A new footbridge and stairs were built, with only a pair of iron newel posts on platform 1 remaining of the earlier stairways. A single track tunnel was built for steam locomotives from Central station to access Eveleigh Railway Workshops. Known as the Engine Dive, it dives to the north of Platform 1 surfacing at the southern end of Platform 10. A number of chimneys still exist, especially on Platform 1.

The present Redfern station was damaged by fire in the 2004 Redfern riots. The ticketing area and station master&#x27;s office were significantly damaged - and the windows in the front of the station were bricked up for almost a year afterwards to prevent further attacks. They have since been replaced with glass windows.

A rising public concern about the lack of disability access to the station platforms led to a petition of over 50,000 signatures and a debate in State Parliament in 2013. Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian committed funding to provide a lift to one platform only which opened in November 2015 on platform 6 and 7.

The Gibbons Street exit closed in 2018 and was replaced by a new entrance on the corner of Gibbons and Lawson Streets in November 2018.

In August 2019, further improved accessibility was proposed including a new concourse at the southern end of the station. The Southern Concourse began construction in 2021 and opened in October 2023. The upgrade provided lift access to Platforms 1–10, a new entrance off Little Eveleigh Street and a relocation of the existing Marian Street entrance. To enable construction of the new concourse it was necessary to relocate a heritage listed building, originally built in 1884, on Platform 1. 

Lift access to platforms 11–12, which are on a diverging, underground alignment, would potentially involve a multi-storey development, is still to be provided. 

==Station configuration==
Redfern has 12 platforms, ten ground level (linked by stairs to the concourse at Lawson Street), and two underground (linked by stairs and escalators to the concourse at Gibbons Street). The two concourses are linked. Station offices and facilities such as toilets and the main indicator boards are located next to the Lawson Street entry.

As part of the construction of the Eastern Suburbs Railway (now platforms 11 and 12), it was proposed to build up to four platforms for the underground route. Two of these platforms were built and now are platforms 11 and 12, however, the two platforms above were half constructed above platforms 11 and 12. These are visible through a small gap in the wall opposite Platform 11, as well as by a boarded up entry portal under the Lawson Street Bridge (which was to be the down track), and a now filled-in dive tunnel under the Wells Street Sectioning Hut on the Central side of Lawson Street. The area in which the platforms were to be situated is visible from the station concourse at the entrance to Platform 10.

==Platforms and services==
==Transport links==
Redfern does not have a connecting bus interchange. However, two stops along Gibbon Street close to the Gibbons Street entrance (near platforms 11 and 12) serve the following Transdev John Holland, Transit Systems and two NightRide routes:
*305: to Mascot Stamford Hotel
*306: to Mascot station
*308: Marrickville Metro to Eddy Avenue
*309: to Port Botany
*N11: Cronulla station to Town Hall station
*N20: Riverwood station to Town Hall station

There are stops further afield in Redfern Street servicing bus routes to Railway Square and in Regent Street servicing bus routes to Marrickville, Mascot and Banksmeadow.

== Heritage listing ==
Redfern Railway Station Group has heritage significance at a state level as a major suburban station which played an important role in the development of the surrounding residential and industrial suburbs. It was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 as &quot;the place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.&quot;

The station includes a number of buildings and structures of rare architecture such as the Queen Anne style overhead booking office and the 1884 station building on Platform 1, which was relocated during the construction of the new southern concourse.

== In popular culture ==
The station appeared in the 2017 film Bad Genius.

<doc id="1028935" wikidata="Q3561137" url="?curid=1028935" title="Eleutheria (play)">
<text>Eleutheria (sometimes rendered Eleuthéria: see above image) is a play by Samuel Beckett, written in French in 1947. It was his first completed dramatic endeavor (after an aborted effort about Samuel Johnson). Roger Blin considered staging it in the early 1950s, but opted for &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, because its smaller cast size made it easier to stage. At this point, Beckett suppressed the manuscript. Beckett later recycled the name &quot;Krap&quot; (with two Ps) for his play &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;.

==Publishing history==
In 1985, Beckett&#x27;s longtime American publisher, Barney Rosset, was fired after a buyout of Grove Press. Beckett offered to help Rosset, and proposed translating &quot;Eleutheria&quot; into English for him to publish, and gave him a copy of the manuscript. But according to the American edition of the play, Beckett was clearly reluctant to sanction publication of the work, and Rosset held off publication.

After Beckett&#x27;s death in 1989, Rosset set out to publish &quot;Eleutheria&quot; in English. It was his view that, like other work that Beckett suppressed but eventually published, he would have changed his mind again had he lived. But Jérôme Lindon, Beckett&#x27;s French publisher and literary executor, was against publication. After much wrangling and some legal threats, Lindon and the estate reluctantly allowed Rosset to publish, and issued their own edition in the original French. The estate will not grant performance licenses; however, a few private shows have been done.

The American edition, published in 1995 by Rosset&#x27;s new company Foxrock, is translated by Michael Brodsky, himself a novelist and playwright. The first English translation had a mixed reception; one critic wrote &quot;the new translation of the long unavailable play will delight Beckett scholars and aficionados alike&quot; (playwright and journalist Jack Helbig writing in Booklist), but as might perhaps be expected the French publisher criticized the translation as &quot;too American.&quot; It contained a few translation errors, such as the phrase &quot;Ton canotier avait un couteau&quot;, which is rendered as &#x27;Your oarsman had a knife&#x27;; a &quot;canotier&quot; is a straw hat and &quot;couteau&quot;, here, means &#x27;osprey feather&#x27;. A British edition was published in 1996 by Faber and Faber, translated by Barbara Wright.

==Plot==
The plot concerns the efforts of a young member of the bourgeoisie, Victor Krap, to cut himself off from society and his family—while at the same time accepting hand-outs from his mother. The title, &quot;eleutheria&quot; (&quot;ελευθερία&quot;) is Greek for &quot;liberty&quot;. Each act takes place on successive Winter days in Paris.

===Act I===
Henri Krap is having problems with his urinary tract, and when he sits down, he is unable to get up. His wife is expecting a visit from her friend, Jeanne Meck, whose husband, a field marshal, has recently died. Before that, her sister comes, newly married to the hideous Dr. André Piouk, a radical with a hideous countenance who wants to end the human population through mandatory use of condoms, abortion, and homosexuality, and encouraged euthanasia. The family&#x27;s main concern, is that Victor has left the household. They have put barbed wire around his favorite places. The family, except for Henri, leaves to try to get Victor to come home. After behaving inappropriately with Olga and Marie, making them uncomfortable, Henri becomes interested in Piouk&#x27;s ideas and muses on the notion of homosexuality, asking Joseph, the servant, to kiss him, who complies. During the night, Henri dies in his chair.

===Act II===
Victor does nothing but move around his apartment in a pattern. He throws one of his shoes out the closed window, and a glazier appears immediately with the shoe, and he and his ten-year-old-son, Michel, set to work fixing the pane. The glazier thinks Michel is a dolt, and things often have to be repeated. Victor&#x27;s family keeps arriving to interrupt the glazier&#x27;s work, and Mme. Karl, the landlady, keeps inquiring as to whether Victor is staying or going. The Kraps want Victor to attend his father&#x27;s funeral, but he is not interested in leaving his apartment. Mme. Meck tries to get her chauffeur, Thomas, to forcibly remove him, but fails.

===Act III===
The glazier is still repairing Victor&#x27;s window, as well as the lock on his door. Victor&#x27;s mother is now ill with grief, and the funeral has been delayed as long as possible to get Victor to attend. The glazier starts to get an explanation that Victor desired freedom from his family, but could not get it because of their interminable visits, but that he has not received any sort of freedom when they are not around, either. An audience member becomes dissatisfied and leaves his box to get on the stage, complaining that the play is going on without providing any satisfaction to the audience. The prompter becomes fed up, and the script plummets from the sky onto the ground. The audience member brings a Chinese torturer to try to cure Victor. Eventually, he gets a mildly satisfactory answer and leaves the stage. Dr. Piouk, whom Victor is stunned to learn is now his uncle by marriage, arrives with Olga to see if he wants to take a poison pill and commit suicide, but he does not wish to. The glazier leaves his work unfinished, leaves the tools to Victor, and Mme. Karl again arrives to ask for the rent. He gives her a wad of money from the drawer, but it&#x27;s not enough, so he gives her the tools, and tells her to pawn the jacket he thinks that he has left on the stairs to pay the rent. She tries to offer him food, but says that she can&#x27;t be a nursemaid to him. He pushes the bed as far from the door and window and as close to the audience member&#x27;s box as possible, then sits on the bed to rest.

==Staging==
The staging calls for &quot;marginal action&quot; which interacts with the main action only at a few specific moments. Victor&#x27;s apartment is always shown on stage, although none of the main action of the first act occurs there. He walks around in a pattern, although much of the details are left up to the actor.

In the second act, Victor&#x27;s apartment is shown from a different angle, and the Krap home is still visible. For much of the act, that part of the stage is empty, except for a moment where Jacques lights the lamp and paws his master&#x27;s armchair. At one point, Victor arrives, and Jacques allows him to sit in his father&#x27;s chair. This part of the stage then remains empty until the end of the act.

In the third act, Victor&#x27;s apartment is seen from yet a third angle, and has encroached upon the stage entirely, with the Krap home completely gone.

==Performance history==

On April 13, 1998, the French Embassy in Washington, DC, hosted the first staged public reading of &quot;Eleutheria&quot; as translated by Michael Brodsky and directed by Robert McNamara. The first production of &quot;Eleutheria&quot; took place in 2005, performed by Naqshineh theatre, as translated by Vahid Rahbani and directed by Vahid Rahbani and Mohammadreza Jouze at the City Theatre of Tehran.

<text>or is a computerized control system used by the East Japan Railway Company to regulate train traffic on railway lines in metropolitan Tokyo, Japan. It was designed by Hitachi. The first deployment was on the Chūō Main Line in 1997. It is now used on fourteen lines listed below.

On ATOS-enabled lines, each train station has electronic displays, which show scheduled arrival times and train destinations in Japanese and English, warn passengers when trains are arriving or passing through, send updates on system delays and accidents, and display messages to advertise JR products or warn passengers not to smoke. Pre-recorded voice announcements in train stations are also automated by ATOS.

ATOS also directs train drivers through 16-by-16 lamp matrices, which flash messages telling the train driver to speed up, slow down, or adjust their scheduled departure time in order to keep the entire network running on schedule.

Several JR lines in the Kantō region use CTC or PRC systems in lieu of ATOS.

<doc id="1028938" wikidata="Q5693228" url="?curid=1028938" title="Heat Vision and Jack">
<text>Heat Vision and Jack is a 1999 American comedy science fiction television pilot created and written by Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon, directed by Ben Stiller, and starring Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and Ron Silver. The pilot was originally ordered by Fox, which ultimately did not order it to series. While the show was not picked up, the pilot became a cult classic and gained an online following.

==Plot==

The pilot opens with Ben Stiller talking about the cancelled &quot;Ben Stiller Show&quot;, the Emmy Award he won for the show, and sarcastically criticizing George Lucas for having not won an Emmy. After a short sting, &quot;Heat Vision&quot; then opens with a title sequence explaining how Jack gained his new powers, and how Heat Vision came into existence.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
* Jack Black as Jack Austin, a former astronaut. He was exposed to inappropriate levels of solar energy, giving him superintelligence. He appears to lose this intelligence at night, requiring only Earth-normal levels of daylight to reactivate it. His catchphrases are &quot;I know EVERYTHING!&quot; and &quot;Knowledge is power... for real.&quot;
* Owen Wilson as Heat Vision, a talking motorcycle. He was created when Jack&#x27;s unemployed roommate Doug was shot by an experimental ray gun, causing him to merge with his motorcycle. He is capable of speech and can fight by ramming into opponents. He is unable to use doorknobs and is unable to right himself if pushed over.
* Ron Silver as himself, the main villain. He works for NASA, and will stop at nothing to capture or kill Jack Austin, but he also dabbles in acting, perhaps as a diversion, perhaps as a cover. He appears to be invulnerable, shrugging off the threat of being shot and later displaying great annoyance but no injury or pain when he is actually shot.

===Guest===
* Christine Taylor as The Sheriff
* Vincent Schiavelli as Frank, a cook who becomes possessed by an alien broadcast and thereafter calls himself Paragon
* O-Lan Jones as Patrice
* Sy Richardson as Doctor

==Legacy==
&quot;Heat Vision&quot; was featured as a part of the mockumentary &quot;Tropic Thunder: Rain of Madness&quot;, only stating that the character of &quot;Jeff Portnoy&quot; played the role of Jack Austin.

In a March 27, 2007 interview, Rob Schrab stated that a script for the &quot;Heat Vision and Jack&quot; feature film was in the works.

<doc id="1028946" wikidata="Q3557223" url="?curid=1028946" title="Victor Chang">
<text>Victor Peter Chang (born Chang Yam Him; 21 November 1936 – 4 July 1991) was a Chinese-born Australian cardiac surgeon and a pioneer of modern heart transplantation in Australia.

His murder in 1991 stunned Australia and is considered one of the most notorious in the country&#x27;s history. Chang was given a state funeral, and in 1999 he was voted Australian of the Century at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards.

After completing his medical studies at the University of Sydney and working in St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, he trained in the United Kingdom and the United States as a surgeon before returning to Australia. At St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, he helped establish the National Cardiac Transplant Unit, the country&#x27;s leading centre for heart and lung transplants. Chang&#x27;s team had a high success rate in performing heart transplants, and he pioneered the development of an artificial heart valve. In 1986, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his &quot;service to international relations between Australia and China and to medical science&quot;.

In 1991, Chang was murdered by two young men in a failed extortion attempt. His legacy includes setting up the Victor Chang Foundation. Additionally, after his death, the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute was created, and the Dr. Victor Chang Lowy Packer Building at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital was established.

== Early life and education ==
Chang was born in 1936 in Shanghai to Australian-born Chinese-British parents. He grew up in Hong Kong, where he attended primary school in Kowloon Tong and spent two years in St. Paul&#x27;s College. On 7 April 1948, Chang&#x27;s mother died from breast cancer at the age of 33, prompting him to consider a career in medicine at the age of 12.

Chang&#x27;s father Aubrey sent him and his younger sister to Sydney in 1951 to stay with extended family. He attended Belmore Boys&#x27; High School in Belmore. He completed his secondary education at Christian Brothers&#x27; High School in Lewisham. He undertook his tertiary education at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Medical Science with First-Class Honours and a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1962.

== Medical career ==
=== Medical training ===
After completing his medical education, Chang interned at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital under cardiac surgeon Mark Shanahan, who sent him to London to train with British surgeon Aubrey York Mason.

Chang became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1966 and trained in cardiothoracic surgery at the Royal Brompton Hospital. In London, he met and married his wife Ann (née Simmons).

Chang spent two years in the United States at the Mayo Clinic and became chief resident. In 1972, he returned to St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, where he was a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon and was appointed Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1973 and Fellow of the American College of Surgeons in 1975.

=== Cardiothoracic surgery career ===
At St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Chang worked with surgeon Harry Windsor, who had performed Australia&#x27;s first heart transplant in 1968. The advent of anti-rejection drugs in 1980 made heart transplants more feasible, and Chang lobbied to raise funds to establish a heart transplant program at St. Vincent&#x27;s. On 8 April 1984, a team of doctors, led by Chang, operated on 14-year-old Fiona Coote, who became Australia&#x27;s youngest heart transplant patient.

Between 1984 and 1990, Chang&#x27;s unit performed over 197 heart transplants and 14 heart–lung transplants. The unit had a high rate of success, with 90% of those receiving transplants from the unit surviving beyond the first year. In 1986, Victor Chang was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) &quot;in recognition of service to international relations between Australia and China and to medical science&quot;.

Concerned about a shortage of organ donors, Chang led the assembly of a team of scientists, engineers, and marketing specialists to develop an artificial heart and manufacture inexpensive heart valves. In 1980, he met Frank Tamru, who acted as a marketing and sales specialist, while he worked for Shiley Laboratories in Singapore. Together with engineers Richard Martin and Brij Gupta, Chang and Tamru founded Pacific Biomedical Enterprises Ltd., which is headquartered in Singapore and set up facilities to develop mechanical and tissue heart valves, called St. Vincent&#x27;s Heart Valves, in Guangzhou and Sydney. The valves were widely used throughout Asia.

== Death ==

On the morning of 4 July 1991, Chang was shot twice in the head in a failed extortion attempt. His body was found slumped in the gutter next to his Mercedes-Benz 500 SL in the Sydney suburb of Mosman. Two Malaysian men, Chew Seng (Ah Sung) Liew and Choon Tee (Phillip) Lim, picked Chang at random from a magazine featuring Asians who had &quot;made it good&quot; in Australia. They ran their Toyota Corolla into Chang&#x27;s vehicle, forcing him to pull over. After getting into an argument with Chang, who refused to give them money, Liew fired the fatal shots. The first shot entered near the right cheek and exited below the right ear while the fatal second, fired from point-blank range, entered the right temple and passed through the brain. Police investigators initially suspected the involvement of Triad syndicates but later concluded the killing was an amateur act.

=== Trial ===

Liew pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 26 years in prison with a non-parole period of 20 years. Lim, who pleaded not guilty and claimed he did not know Liew had a firearm, received a sentence of 18 to 24 years. Another man, Stanley Ng, abandoned the extortion plan a day before the murder. He had unsuccessfully tried detaining Chang twice to force him to give $3 million. Ng was granted immunity for his evidence. The prosecution alleged the plan had been to abduct Chang, tie him up with his family at his home in Clontarf, and threaten to hang them to coerce Chang into withdrawing money from the bank. In his ruling, Supreme Court Judge John Slattery stated, &quot;It was an absurd, improbable plan, always doomed to failure&quot;.

On 26 October 2009, Lim was granted parole. Following a public outcry and objection by the New South Wales Corrective Services Minister, John Robertson, his release was put on hold, pending another parole hearing. The New South Wales Supreme Court ruled that the Parole Authority lacked the power to rescind their previous parole decision. Lim was freed from Parramatta Correctional Centre on 1 March 2010 into the custody of immigration officers waiting outside. He was to be deported back to Kuala Lumpur on 2 March, but the flight was canceled for technical reasons. He was flown out of Australia on 3 March.

After 21 years in prison, Liew was granted parole. In his parole hearing, he made a broad apology for the crime and stated that he believed that his long term in prison had had a good effect. There was a small objection from NSW Attorney-General Greg Smith; however, this was retracted, and Liew was released from prison on 12 October 2012 and was met by immigration officers. He was sent back to Malaysia the next day.

===Memorial===
Chang was given a state funeral. He was cremated and his ashes were buried under a memorial plaque at Green Park, Darlinghurst, opposite St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital. His manner of death is described in the Dr. Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute website as a &quot;tragic circumstance&quot;.

In April 2012, Australia Post released a commemorative postcard and postage stamp featuring a portrait of Dr Chang.

== Legacy ==

In 1984, Chang founded the Victor Chang Foundation to grant funds in two areas he felt passionate about: education and innovation in cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery. The foundation continues today under the leadership of his daughter Vanessa Chang.

On 15 February 1994, the Dr. Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, a body intended to focus on researching &quot;the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart muscle diseases,&quot; was launched by Prime Minister Paul Keating with Kerry Packer as its patron. The Dr. Victor Chang Science Labs in Christian Brothers&#x27; High School are named after him. 

In 1999, Prime Minister John Howard announced Chang as Australian of the Century at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards after a decision between two Australian larrikins and two lifesavers. Swimmer Dawn Fraser, cricketer Donald Bradman, and ophthalmologist Fred Hollows were other contenders.

In St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, the Dr. Victor Chang Lowy Packer Building was established in 2008 with $35 million from the state government and $45 million in corporate and private donations. Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark officially opened the building and declared that Chang &quot;was an original thinker and saw the need for research and the development of heart assist devices and, not least, he is known for his legendary caring for his patients and their families&quot;. In &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;A Golden Anniversary&quot; article, which lists people who have shaped the last &quot;50 Years in the South Pacific&quot; (1959–2009), Chang was listed as the figure of 1979–1989.

In 2017, a Sydney Ferries Emerald-class ferry was named &quot;Dr. Victor Chang&quot;. Minor planet 24450 was named after him. On 21 November 2023, Google celebrated his 87th birthday with a Google Doodle.

== Personal life ==
Chang met his wife Ann Simmons in 1966. He was the on-call emergency physician at St. Anthony&#x27;s Hospital in North Cheam, London, where Ann took herself after being taken unwell at a party. They had 3 children: Vanessa, Matthew, and Marcus.

According to his children, he enjoyed driving, saying that cars &quot;provided a chance for Dad to get away from it all; they were his hobby and his opportunity to relax&quot;. He restored a 1950s MG TF, and enjoyed the opportunity to vigorously drive many cars, including his 1982 Citroën CX Prestige and several Porsches.

Chang had two younger siblings: sister Frances and brother Anthony. He was not religious but was known to ask the hospital&#x27;s nun, Sister Bernice, to say a prayer for his patients and was known for his compassion.

<text>The White Wing (or Aerodrome #2) was an early US aircraft designed by Frederick W. Baldwin and built by the Aerial Experiment Association in 1908. Unusual for aircraft of its day, it featured a wheeled undercarriage. The wings were equipped with ailerons controlled by a harness worn around the pilot&#x27;s body; leaning in one direction would cause the aircraft to bank to follow. The ailerons led to a legal dispute with the Wright brothers over the brothers&#x27; patent on movable wing surfaces.

First piloted by Baldwin himself on 18 May and the aircraft flew very well. White Wing was then piloted by Lt Thomas Selfridge at Hammondsport, New York, on 19 May 1908 (becoming the first US Army officer to fly an airplane) and then Glenn Curtiss made a flight of 1,017 ft (310 m) in it on 21 May. On 23 May, it crashed during a landing by John McCurdy and was damaged beyond repair.

<doc id="1028954" wikidata="Q4982428" url="?curid=1028954" title="Pitt Street">
<text>Pitt Street is a major street in the Sydney central business district in New South Wales, Australia. The street runs through the entire city centre from Circular Quay in the north to Waterloo, although today&#x27;s street is in two disjointed sections after a substantial stretch of it was removed to make way for Sydney&#x27;s Central railway station. Pitt Street is well known for the pedestrian only retail centre of Pitt Street Mall, a section of the street which runs from King Street to Market Street.

Pitt Street is a one way (southbound only) from Circular Quay to Pitt Street Mall and (northbound only) from Pitt Street Mall to Goulburn Street, while Pitt Street Mall is for pedestrians only. It is dominated by retail and commercial office space.

==History==
Pitt Street was originally named Pitt Row, and is one of the earliest named streets in Sydney. Pitt Street is believed to have been named by Governor Arthur Phillip in honour of William Pitt the Younger, at the time, the Prime Minister of Great Britain. In 1853, Pitt Street was extended north from Hunter Street to Circular Quay.

Pitt Street was previously a one-way street in a southerly direction from Circular Quay to Campbell Street. In preparation for the construction of the Pitt Street Mall, in February 1987 the sections between Hunter Street and Martin Place, and Martin Place and King Street were converted to two-way cul de sacs to allow the Martin Place plaza to be extended. This was later reverted and today the Circular Quay to King Street section is one-way throughout in a southerly direction. From Goulburn Street to Park Street was converted to become one-way in a northerly direction. The Market Street to Park Street section initially remained as a southbound street, but was later converted to run northbound. The Goulburn Street to Campbell Street section was converted to two-way.

===Tram line===
The Circular Quay to Central station line was an important part of the Sydney tram network. It was an extremely busy service for passengers transferring from suburban trains, particularly prior to the opening of the City Circle underground railway line in 1926. Trams operated in a loop from Central station, running north along Pitt Street to Circular Quay returning south via Castlereagh Street. These tracks were also used by some eastern and south-western routes during busy periods. The line closed on 27 September 1957 with four tram services replaced with buses and three others diverted to operate via Elizabeth Street. The line made use of the sandstone viaduct onto the colonnade above Eddy Avenue at Central station, which since 1997 has formed part of the Inner West Light Rail.

=== Heritage-listed properties ===
The following properties, located on or adjacent to Pitt Street, are listed on various national, state, and/or local government heritage registers:
*Bulletin Place warehouses, on Bulletin Place, between Pitt Street and Macquarie Place
*Commonwealth Trading Bank Building
*Kings Hotel
*Pitt Street Uniting Church
*Soul Pattinson Building
*The Strand Arcade
*Sydney School of Arts building
*Former Sydney Water Head Office
*The Sydney Club
*Wales House, now part of the Radisson Blu hotel chain

== Pitt Street Cycleway ==
During the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 the City of Sydney installed a &quot;pop up&quot; (or temporary) cycleway on Pitt Street. This cycleway was the busiest of all the pop up cycleways installed, with an average of 4430 weekly trips.

In March 2021 the city announced the cycleway would become permanent. It now connects to the King Street cycleway at the south end.

<doc id="1028965" wikidata="Q855552" url="?curid=1028965" title="African oystercatcher">
<text>The African oystercatcher or African black oystercatcher (Haematopus moquini) is a large charismatic wader resident to the mainland coasts and offshore islands of southern Africa. This near-threatened oystercatcher has a population of over 6,000 adults, which breed between November and April. The scientific name &quot;moquini&quot; commemorates the French naturalist Alfred Moquin-Tandon who discovered and named this species before Bonaparte.

==Description==
The African oystercatcher is a large, noisy wader, with completely black plumage, red legs and a strong broad red bill. The sexes are similar in appearance, however, females are larger and have a slightly longer beak than males. Juveniles have soft grey plumage and do not express the characteristic red legs and beak until after they fledged. The call is a distinctive loud piping, very similar to Eurasian oystercatchers. As the Eurasian oystercatcher is a migratory species they only occur as a vagrant in southern Africa, and its black-and-white plumage makes confusion impossible.

==Distribution and habitat==
The African oystercatcher is native to the mainland coasts and offshore islands of Southern Africa - sometimes occurring as a vagrant in Angola and Mozambique. Its breeding range extends from Lüderitz, Namibia to Mazeppa Bay, Eastern Cape, South Africa. There are estimated to be over 6,000 adult birds in total.

Typically sedentary African oystercatchers rarely leave their territories, which include a nesting site and feeding grounds. These will usually be located on or near rocky shores where they can feed.

==Ecology==

===Feeding===
African oystercatchers predominantly feed on molluscs such as mussels and limpets, although they are known to also feed on polychaetes, insects and potentially even fish. They are adapted to pry open mussels and loosen limpets off the rocks but have been recorded picking through sand to locate other food items.

===Breeding===
The nest is a bare scrape on pebbles, sand or shingle within about of the high-water mark. On rock ledges there may be a rim of shells to keep the eggs in place. The female generally lays two eggs, but there may be one or three, which are incubated by both adults. The incubation period varies between 27 and 39 days and the young take a further 38 or so days to fledge. Breeding success is greater on offshore islands where there are few predators and less disturbance than mainland sites.

The eggs average about in length, ranging from , and have a breadth of , ranging from .

===Longevity and mortality===
The lifespan of an African oystercatcher is about 35 years, of which they are known to pair up for 25 years. Although adults are rarely predated, most mainland egg and chick fatalities are due to disturbance by people, off-road vehicles, dog attacks and predation by the kelp gull &quot;(Larus dominicanus)&quot; and other avian predators. Offshore pairs experience similar avian predation although most chicks perish due to starvation.

==Status==
As of December 2017 the global IUCN assessment of the African oystercatcher&#x27;s status is &quot;Least Concern&quot;. The population trend seems to be upward as the local community becomes more involved in adopting conservation measures. In South Africa, the species has also been downlisted to Least Concern. A long-term program by the South African Ringing Scheme is tracking the dispersal of ringed birds to keep conservation assessments in South Africa and Namibia up to date.

<text>Gregory Edward Smith (born July 6, 1983) is a Canadian and American actor and director. Smith has appeared in several Hollywood films, and is known for his roles as Alan Abernathy in &quot;Small Soldiers&quot;, Ephram Brown on The WB television series &quot;Everwood&quot;, and as Dov Epstein on the Global police drama series &quot;Rookie Blue&quot;.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Terrea (&quot;née&quot; Oster), a teacher from the United States, and Maurice Smith, a producer of low-budget films originally from the United Kingdom. Smith&#x27;s mother appeared in several of the films that his father produced during the 1980s. Smith has two brothers, including fellow actor Douglas Smith, and a sister.

==Career==
Smith began acting when he was fourteen months old, and appeared in a Tide television commercial and in store catalogues. After a role in the 1994 children&#x27;s film &quot;Andre&quot;, he starred in the 1995 direct-to-video release &quot;Leapin&#x27; Leprechauns!&quot; and its 1996 sequel, &quot;Spellbreaker: Secret of the Leprechauns&quot;. Also in 1996, Smith appeared opposite Michelle Trachtenberg in &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;.

Smith subsequently starred in another direct-to-video film, &quot;Shadow Zone: My Teacher Ate My Homework&quot;, and appeared in three 1998 films: &quot;Krippendorf&#x27;s Tribe&quot;, playing one of the children of the title character, &quot;The Climb&quot;, a drama also starring John Hurt, and the film &quot;Small Soldiers&quot;, in which Smith had a lead role opposite Kirsten Dunst, and for which he won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film Leading Young Actor in 1999.

During the 2000s, Smith appeared in the Mel Gibson-led &quot;The Patriot&quot; (2000), played outlaw Jim Younger in the western &quot;American Outlaws&quot; (2001), was featured in the short-lived 2001 CBS drama series &quot;Kate Brasher&quot;, and was cast in a lead role on The WB Television Network show, &quot;Everwood&quot;, which became a success and ran from 2002 until June 2006. His role on the show was described by &quot;The Independent Weekly&quot; as &quot;one of the best portrayals of a thoughtful, alienated teenager on television&quot;. For this role, Smith won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV series (Comedy or Drama) Leading Young Actor in 2003. During &quot;Everwood&quot;&#x27;s filming, Smith owned a home on location in Park City, Utah.

In 2005, Smith appeared in the comedy-drama film &quot;Kids in America&quot;, which had a regional release in the U.S. During the film, Smith shared the longest on-screen kiss with Stephanie Sherrin, timed at almost six minutes. He also played in &quot;Zenon (Girl of the 21st Century)&quot; as Greg.

Smith next appeared in the independent film drama &quot;Nearing Grace&quot;, which received a limited theatrical release on October 13, 2006; in the film, which co-stars Ashley Johnson and Jordana Brewster, he plays Henry Nearing, a high senior in the 1970s. The News &amp; Observer&#x27;s review of the film described Smith&#x27;s character as &quot;self-deluded&quot; and &quot;perpetually brow-furrowing&quot;, although The Seattle Times noted that Smith was &quot;likable&quot;, and HeraldNet&#x27;s review specified that a &quot;better movie will make [Smith] a star&quot;.

In 2007, Smith had a small role in &quot;The Seeker: The Dark is Rising&quot; as Max Stanton. Smith next appeared in the Richard Attenborough-directed period romance &quot;Closing the Ring&quot;, playing a younger version of Christopher Plummer&#x27;s character Young Jack, as well as in the thriller &quot;Boot Camp&quot;, which co-stars Mila Kunis.

<text>The Combs method is a rule base reduction method of writing fuzzy logic rules described by William E. Combs in 1997. It is designed to prevent combinatorial explosion in fuzzy logic rules.

The Combs method takes advantage of the logical equality formula_1.

== Equality proof ==
The simplest proof of given equality involves usage of truth tables:
== Combinatorial explosion ==
Suppose we have a fuzzy system that considers N variables at a time, each of which can fit into at least one of S sets. The number of rules necessary to cover all the cases in a traditional fuzzy system is formula_2, whereas the Combs method would need only formula_3 rules. For example, if we have five sets and five variables to consider to produce one output, covering all the cases would require 3125 rules in a traditional system, while the Combs method would require only 25 rules, taming the combinatorial explosion that occurs when more inputs or more sets are added to the system.

This article will focus on the Combs method itself. To learn more about the way rules are traditionally formed, see fuzzy logic and fuzzy associative matrix.

== Example ==
Suppose we were designing an artificial personality system that determined how friendly the personality is supposed to be towards a person in a strategic video game. The personality would consider its own fear, trust, and love in the other person. A set of rules in the Combs system might look like this:
The table translates to:

 [IF Fear IS Unafraid THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
 IF Fear IS ModerateFear THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
 IF Fear IS Afraid THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends ]
 OR
 [IF Trust IS Distrusting THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
 IF Trust IS ModerateTrust THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
 IF Trust IS Trusting THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends]
 OR
 [IF Love IS Unloving THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
 IF Love IS ModerateLove THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
 IF Love IS Loving THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends]

In this case, because the table follows a straightforward pattern in the output, it could be rewritten as:
Each column of the table maps to the output provided in the last row. To obtain the output of the system, we just average the outputs of each rule for that output. For example, to calculate how much the computer is Enemies with the player, we take the average of how much the computer is Unafraid, Distrusting, and Unloving of the player. When all three averages are obtained, the result can then be defuzzified by any of the traditional means.

<text>The is a popular folk song and dance performed at matsuri (and occasionally Undokai sports days) in Gunma and Tochigi, Japan. It consists of dancers with broad hats called &quot;kasa&quot; going in a counter clockwise circle around a mikoshi. The dance is very energetic and ends with everyone throwing their hats in the air. The &quot;Yagi&quot; (八木, literally &quot;eight trees&quot;) came from , one of the post stations on the Nikkō Reiheishi Kaidō Road, and is not to be confused with the &quot;yagi&quot; (山羊, goat).

==History==
The song was first sung by Seizaburo Maruyama, who was from the town of Asakura (currently Ashikaga, Tochigi) and known as &quot;Seizo Asakura&quot;, and popularized by Gentaro Watanabe &quot;Genta Horigome&quot;.

The original form of the song is said to be , which originated in Niigata. It was later arranged and spread along the Nikkō Reiheishi Kaidō Road by craftmen and traveling entertainers such as Goze. Eventually one around Yagi-shuku became the most popular, where Watanabe and others developed today&#x27;s form.

<text>Sitamarhi is an Indian city in the Mithila region of Bihar. It is the district headquarters of the Sitamarhi district in Tirhut Division. The city was named in honour of Sītā, wife of Rāma, who was born in Sitamarhi according to Hindu legends.

In 1875, a subdivision for Sitamarhi was created within the Muzaffarpur district. Sitamarhi was detached from Muzaffarpur and made a separate district on December 11, 1972. The district headquarters is located in Dumra, south of Sitamarhi&#x27;s main temple.

==Geography==
Sitamarhi has an average elevation of .

Pupri, Bairgania, Sursand and Bhitthamore are all towns on the Indo-Nepal border not far from Sitamarhi.

==Culture==
Sitamarhi dates back to the time of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; epic, which describes it as the place where King Janaka found the goddess Sita.

A temple dedicated to Sita is located at Punaura Dham Sitamarhi. A rock-cut sanctuary from the Mauryan period is also found near Sitamarhi.

Several cultural events occur annually in Sitamarhi: Dumra hosts festivities for Rama Navami each spring; a ceremony commemorating the marriage of Ram and Sita happens every year in Janaki Sthan; and the winter festival of Sama Chakeva celebrates brother-sister relationships.

==Demographics==
As of the 2011 Census, Sitamarhi District has a total population of around 106,093. There are around 56,693 males and 49,400 females. 69,507 people are literate, including 39,537 males and 29,070 females. The average literacy rate is 52.04% in total, 60.64% for males, and 42.41% for females. The sex ratio is 899, and the child sex ratio is 872.

==Administration==
Sitamarhi is a part of the Tirhut Division. Currently, Sitamarhi consists of three sub-divisions and seventeen blocks. Its headquarters are located at Dumra, five kilometers south of Sitamarhi. The District Magistrate is the top-most official of revenue and civil administration and is assisted by ADM and other district officers.

The district has been divided into three subdivisions: Sadar, Pupri, and Belsand. Each is headed by sub-divisional officers either from the IAS (Indian Administrative Service) or BAS (Bihar Administrative Service). Sub-divisional officers are under the direct authority of the District Magistrate. Subdivisions are divided into 17 development blocks where BDOs (Block Development Officers) are charged with carrying out development and welfare projects. Sitamarhi district has 845 revenue villages. The district&#x27;s judicial system is headed by the District and Sessions Judge, who is in turn assisted by other Judges and Munsiff magistrates posted at district and sub-division levels.

==Transportation==
National Highway 77 connects Sitamarhi to Mehsi, Muzaffarpur and Patna, and other roads connect the city to adjoining districts. National Highway 227 runs towards Sheohar in the west and the border town Bhitthamore in the east. State highways link Sitamarhi to Madhubani district in the east.

Sitamarhi Junction railway station is a five-platform station on the Darbhanga–Raxaul–Narkatiaganj line, which was converted to broad gauge in February 2014. Another broad-gauge track connects Sitamarhi to Muzaffarpur. Direct train services are available from Sitamarhi Junction to cities including New Delhi, Kolkata, Varanasi, Lucknow, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Kanpur, and Mumbai.

The nearest airport to Sitamarhi is the Darbhanga Airport, about away.

Sitamarhi is connected to cities in and around Bihar by state-owned transport services. Many private buses (both AC and non-AC) operate between Sitamarhi and Patna.

<text>The June Bug was an American &quot;pioneer era&quot; biplane built by the Aerial Experiment Association (A.E.A) in 1908 and flown by Glenn Hammond Curtiss. The aircraft was the first American airplane to fly at least 1 km in front of a crowd.

==Design and development==
A &quot;Scientific American&quot; competition in 1907 offered a solid silver sculpted trophy, and $25,000 in cash, to be awarded to whoever made the first public flight of over 1 kilometer (3,280 ft) in an American aircraft. In 1907, Glenn Curtiss and the Aerial Experiment Association began building the &quot;June Bug&quot; with hopes of winning the Scientific American Cup.

The &quot;June Bug,&quot; also referred to as &quot;Aerodrome #3&quot; (the third powered airplane built by the A.E.A), included the previously used aileron steering system, but a shoulder yoke made it possible for the pilot to steer by leaning from side to side. The aircraft featured a canard, horizontal surfaces, and a rear rudder. The original varnish sealing the wing fabric cracked in the heat, so a mixture of turpentine, paraffin, and gasoline was used on the aircraft instead. The &quot;June Bug&quot; had yellow wings due to the yellow ochre added to the wing mixture in order to make the aircraft show up better in the orthochromic-form monochrome photographs of the time.

The aircraft was named by Alexander Graham Bell after the common &quot;Phyllophaga&quot;, a beetle known colloquially in North America as the &quot;June bug&quot;. This was because June bugs were observed to fly similarly to aircraft: they have large stiff outer wings for gliding, and more delicate smaller propeller-like wings that do the actual propulsion.

The &quot;June Bug&quot; was tested by G.H. Curtiss in Hammondsport, New York, at Stony Brook Farm, on June 21, 1908. Three of the four test flights were successful, with distances of , , and , at an average speed of . On June 25, performances of and were considered encouraging, and the A.E.A. contacted the Aero Club of America to sign up for the Scientific American Cup.

==Operational history==

===Cup attempt===

The Aero Club contacted the Wright brothers, offering them the chance to make an attempt first. Orville wrote to decline the opportunity on June 30, as the Wrights were busy completing their deal with the United States government. Orville&#x27;s message was received by July 1, and G.H. Curtiss took to the air as requested on July 4 (Independence Day).

The flight was made a public event, and spectators were allowed to watch. The event was overseen by a delegation of 22 members of the Aero Club, headed by Alan R. Hawley. The Kalem Company&#x27;s film crew covered the event, making the &quot;June Bug&quot; the first airplane in the United States to perform in a movie. The nearby Pleasant Valley Wine Company opened its doors and offered free samples to the spectators at the event. Charles M. Manly, who had unsuccessfully tested the Langley Aerodrome in 1903, measured out the 1 km and distance with volunteer help. The &quot;June Bug&quot; took one false start, going high, but not far enough. On the second try, the airplane successfully flew 5,085 ft (1550 m) in 1 minute 42 seconds, winning the trophy and a US$25,000 cash prize.

Amidst the publicity following the flight, the Wrights sent a warning to Curtiss that they had not given permission for the use of &quot;their&quot; aircraft control system to be used &quot;for exhibitions or in a commercial way&quot;. In fact, none of the A.E.A.&#x27;s aircraft used a wing-warping system like the Wrights&#x27; for control, relying instead on triangular ailerons designed by Alexander Graham Bell, which he successfully patented in December 1911. However, in 1913 a court ruled that this technique was an infringement of the Wright&#x27;s 1906 patent.

Three years previous to the &quot;June Bug&quot;″s flight, the Wrights had made flights of up to 24 miles (38 km) without official witnesses. However, the Wrights would have been required to install wheels and dispense with a catapult launch to compete for the 1908 prize.

==Later use==

From October to November, the &quot;June Bug&quot; was modified by adding floats to it in an attempt to create a seaplane. Renamed Loon, attempts to fly it began on Keuka Lake on November 28. Although the aircraft could achieve speeds of up to on the water, it could not take off, and on January 2, 1909, one of the floats filled with water, causing the &quot;Loon&quot; to sink. It was recovered, but rotted in a nearby boathouse.

A replica of the &quot;June Bug&quot; was built and flown in 1976 by Mercury Aircraft of Hammondsport.

<doc id="1029003" wikidata="Q34412" url="?curid=1029003" title="Foshan">
<text>Foshan (, ; Chinese: 佛山) is a prefecture-level city in central Guangdong Province, China. The entire prefecture covers and had a population of 9,498,863 as of the 2020 census. The city is part of the western side of the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, a conurbation housing 86,100,000 inhabitants, making it the biggest urban area of the world.

Foshan is regarded as the home of Cantonese opera, a genre of Chinese opera; Nanquan, a martial art; and lion dancing.


==Name==

&quot;Fóshān&quot; is the pinyin romanization of the city&#x27;s Chinese name , based on its Mandarin pronunciation. The Postal Map spelling &quot;Fatshan&quot; derives from the same name&#x27;s local Cantonese pronunciation. Other romanizations include Fat-shan and Fat-shun. Foshan means &quot;BuddhaMountain&quot; and, despite the more famous present-day statue of Guanyin (or Kwanyin) on Mount Xiqiao, who isn&#x27;t a Buddha, it refers to a smaller hill near the centre of town where three bronze sculptures of Buddha were discovered in AD 628. The town grew up around a monastery founded nearby that was destroyed in 1391.

==History==
===Pre-20th century===
Foshan remained a minor settlement on the Fen River for most of China&#x27;s history. It developed around a Tang-era Buddhist monastery that was destroyed in 1391. The Foshan Ancestral Temple, a Taoist temple to the Northern God (&quot;Beidi&quot;) that was rebuilt in 1372, became the new focus of the community by the 15th century.

By the early Ming, Foshan had grown into one of the four great markets in China, primarily on the strength of its local ceramics but also on account of its metalwork. Under the Qing, its harbor on the Fen River was limited to ships of a thousand tons&#x27; burden but it remained well connected with Guangdong&#x27;s other ports. By the 19th century, Foshan was considered the &quot;Birmingham of China&quot;, with its steel industry responsible for the consumption of the majority of the province&#x27;s iron production.

===20th century and onwards===
Foshan was connected to Guangzhou and Sanshui by rail in the early 20th century. The Ancestral Temple was converted into the Foshan Municipal Museum upon the victory of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War in 1949.

Foshan remained primarily focused on ceramic and steel production until the 1950s, when it became an urbanizing political center. On 26 June 1951, it left Nanhai County to become a separate county-level city and, in 1954, it was made the seat of the prefectural government. Its economy stagnated as a result of the Cultural Revolution—traditional ceramic ware was forbidden and its workshops were turned to producing Maoist and Revolutionary —but it continued to grow, reaching 300,000 people by the 1970s, making it the province&#x27;s second city after Guangzhou.

As early as 1973, however, its agriculture and consumer industries were permitted to become an export production base and a modern highway linked it to Guangzhou soon after. This permitted its party secretary Tong Mengqing and mayor Yu Fei to take full advantage when Deng Xiaoping introduced his Opening Up policies after the fall of the Gang of Four.

In 1983, Foshan was promoted to a prefecture-level city with its former core becoming the new Chancheng District but lost the southwestern half of its former territory to Jiangmen. On 8 December 2002, Shunde and Nanhai joined its urban core as a full district.

Since 2020, a Japanese-themed street in Foshan has become a hit with young people unable to travel abroad due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 100m-long road called Ichiban Street has been outfitted by a local property developer to resemble famous commercial streets in Japan, complete with a sakura tree, an icon of Japan. The &quot;exotic&quot; street is attracting young people from nearby cities like Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai as the younger Chinese generation likes many things about Japanese culture and design. After negative responses and anti-Japanese sentiment, all Japanese signage was removed and the street has been mostly abandoned.

<doc id="1029007" wikidata="Q888655" url="?curid=1029007" title="Bobby Rush (musician)">
<text>Bobby Rush (born Emmett Ellis Jr. in Homer, Louisiana on November 10, 1933) is an American blues musician, composer, record producer, and singer. His style incorporates elements of blues, rap, and funk, as well as a comic sense about blues tropes. 

Rush has won twelve Blues Music Awards and in 2017, at the age of 83, he won his first Grammy Award for the album &quot;Porcupine Meat&quot;. He is inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame, and Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame.

==Life and career==
Rush is the son of Emmett and Mattie Ellis. His father was a pastor whose guitar and harmonica playing provided early musical influences. As a young child he began experimenting with music using a sugarcane syrup bucket and a broom-wire diddley bow. Around 1947, he and the family moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where his father took on the pastorate of a church and was a farmer.

It was here that Rush would become friends with Elmore James, the slide player Boyd Gilmore (James&#x27;s cousin), and the piano player Johnny &quot;Big Moose&quot; Walker; eventually forming a band to support his singing and harmonica and guitar playing. His band, Bobby Rush and the Four Jivers, consisted of Gilmore, Walker, Pinetop Perkins, and Robert Plunkett. Through Gilmore, Rush became friends with Clarksdale musician Ike Turner.

Still a teen, Rush donned a fake moustache to play in local juke joints with the band, fascinated by enthusiasm of the crowds. His family relocated to Chicago in 1953, where he became part of the local blues scene in the following decade. In Chicago, he met and befriended Little Walter and Muddy Waters who lived nearby. Little Walter got him a job at a club called Skins where they played behind a curtain for a white audience, and began working for Jimmy Reed. Through these connections he began performing on a circuit with Etta James, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Jimmy Reed.

In the early 1970s a song he wrote, &quot;Chicken Heads&quot;, released by Galaxy, became his breakout record after being picked up from a small label started by the former Vee Jay Records producer Calvin Carter. It reached No. 34 the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1971. &quot;Chicken Heads&quot; would become Rush&#x27;s first certified gold certified record in 1971, and would later re-enter the Billboard chart 30 years after its release as a result of being featured in the film &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot;.

Rush later recorded with a leading label for black music, Philadelphia International, releasing his first album, &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, produced by Leon Huff, with one track, &quot;I Wanna Do the Do,&quot; reaching No. 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1979. Reviewing &quot;Rush Hour&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;A lot of this is fun—I&#x27;m delighted to find Leon Huff collaborating with someone who&#x27;s got funk in his soul, and heartened to hear a protest song about the problem of lost keys. But a lot of it—the witless &#x27;Evil Is,&#x27; the characterless &#x27;Hey, Western Union Man&#x27;—is dumber than Kenny Gamble.&quot;

His next albums to become gold certified would be &quot;Sue&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Studdin&#x27; Ya&quot; in 1991.

After Living in Chicago for 48 years, Rush moved to Jackson, Mississippi, to find the roots of his enslaved ancestors.

He recorded a series of records for the LaJam label, Malaco&#x27;s Waldoxy imprint, and in 2003, his own Deep Rush label with partner Greg Preston, a former Malaco Records executive. One of the artists on the label is Crystal Springs, Mississippi native and former bandmate Dexter Allen.

He appeared in the 2003 documentary &quot;The Road to Memphis&quot; which is part of the series &quot;The Blues&quot;, produced by Martin Scorsese. As a result of the Scorsese film, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named him &quot;&#x27;King of the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit&#x27; because of his 50 years of relentless touring and colorful live show.&quot;

His 2004 album &quot;FolkFunk&quot; was a return to a more rootsier sound, featuring guitarist Alvin Youngblood Hart. That year he was a judge for the second annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers. He also performed at the White House along with James Brown when Bill Clinton went into office. In 2014 he again performed for Bill and Hillary Clinton for a state event in Arkansas.

In 2007, he became the first blues artist to perform in China, earning him the title “International Dean of the Blues.” He was later named Friendship Ambassador to the Great Wall of China after performing the largest concert ever held at that site. In addition, Rush has toured in most major markets around the world, including Sydney, Australia; Paris, France; Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; Johannesburg, South Africa; Berlin, Germany; Rome, Italy; Barcelona, Spain; Lucerne, Switzerland; New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Memphis, Tennessee; Los Angeles, California; to Jackson, Mississippi.

In 2014, Rush&#x27;s album &quot;Down in Louisiana&quot;, was Grammy-nominated for &quot;Best Blues Album&quot;, and won a Blues Music Award in the &#x27;Soul Blues Album of the Year&#x27; category, whilst Rush was also nominated in two other categories. Following 2014&#x27;s Grammy nomination, Rush was nominated again for &quot;Best Blues Album&quot; in 2015 for &quot;Decisions&quot;, with Blinddog Smokin&#x27; and featuring Rock n&#x27; Roll Hall of Famer Dr. John.

In July 2014, Rush performed with Dan Aykroyd one of James Brown&#x27;s songs on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

He appears in the 2015 documentary film &quot;I Am the Blues&quot;. He also appeared as himself performing &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Studdin&#x27; You&quot; in the 2019 film &quot;Dolemite Is My Name&quot;.

== Awards and recognition ==
Rush received recognition for his music after the release of his 22nd album, &quot;Rush&quot;, when he was awarded &quot;Best Male Soul Blues Artist&quot; at the Blues Music Awards. He also received &quot;best acoustic artist&quot; and &quot;best acoustic album&quot; for his album &quot;Raw&quot;.

In 2006, Rush was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.

In 2008, Rush was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Jackson, Mississippi.

In 2012, Rush was inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.

In May 2015, Rush cut the ribbon for the Blues Hall of Fame, with an introduction by the Memphis Head of Tourism and aired live on local news.

In 2015, Rush won two Blues Music Awards: &#x27;Soul Blues Male Artist&#x27; and &#x27;B.B. King Entertainer of the Year&#x27;.

In May 2019, Rush was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Rhodes College. As part of the graduation ceremony, the worldwide premiere of his blues rendition of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; occurred. This video was recorded at Royal Studios with Eddie Cotton and Rhodes College&#x27;s students from the Mike Curb for Music Institute.

In 2015, Rush was inducted into the Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame.

In 2017, Rush won a Blues Music Award for Album of the Year for &quot;Porcupine Meat&quot; and for Historical Album of the Year for &quot;Chicken Heads: A 50-Year History of Bobby Rush.&quot; These were the eleventh and twelfth Blues Music Awards Rush has been awarded by the Blues Foundation during his career. He gained his 13th Blues Music Award in 2020, this time in the &#x27;Soul Blues Album of the Year&#x27; category for &quot;Sitting on Top of the Blues&quot;.

=== Grammy Awards ===
In 2017, at the age of 83, Rush won his first Grammy Award in the category Best Traditional Blues Album for &quot;Porcupine Meat&quot;. In 2018, a remix of Rush&#x27;s song &quot;Funk O&#x27;De Funk&quot; by American electronic music duo Smle was nominated for Best Remixed Recording at the 60th Grammy Awards. The rendition lost to Latroit&#x27;s remix of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;You Move&quot;.

<doc id="1029019" wikidata="Q62493" url="?curid=1029019" title="Philip Agee">
<text>Philip Burnett Franklin Agee (; January 19, 1935 – January 7, 2008) was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer and writer of the 1975 bestseller, &quot;Inside the Company: CIA Diary&quot;, detailing his experiences in the Agency. Agee joined the CIA in 1957, and over the next decade had postings in Washington, D.C., Ecuador, Uruguay and Mexico. After resigning from the CIA in 1968, he became a leading opponent of its practices. A co-founder of the &quot;CounterSpy&quot; and &quot;CovertAction&quot; series of periodicals, he died in Cuba in January 2008.

== Early years ==
Agee was born in Tacoma, Florida and raised in Tampa. In his memoir &quot;On the Run&quot; (1987), he wrote that he had &quot;a privileged upbringing in a big white house bordering an exclusive golf club&quot;. After graduating from Tampa&#x27;s Jesuit High School, he attended the University of Notre Dame, from which he graduated cum laude in 1956. He later attended the University of Florida College of Law, and served in the United States Air Force from 1957 to 1960. Agee then worked as a case officer for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1960 to 1968, including postings to Quito, Montevideo, and Mexico City.

== Leaving the CIA ==
Agee stated that by the late 1960s, his Roman Catholic social conscience had made him increasingly uncomfortable with his work, resulting in his disillusionment with the CIA and its support for authoritarian governments across Latin America. He came to believe that the Agency was repressing legitimate national ideals to serve the interests of U.S. multinational corporations. He was disturbed that U.S. forces were used to quell the revolution in the Dominican Republic in 1965, &quot;not because it was Communist but because it was nationalist&quot;.

Agee&#x27;s disillusionment came to a head in the months leading up to and during the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games. Beginning in summer of 1967, he had a &quot;cover&quot; assignment to work with the Olympic Organizing Committee and its year-long Cultural Program of events. Agee&#x27;s marriage to Janet was ending, and in an &quot;Inside the Company&quot; diary entry from December 1967, he wrote:

In a June 1968 meeting with his manager, Agee learned that the CIA station in Mexico City was &quot;very pleased with his work&quot; and offered him &quot;another promotion&quot;, and that his manager &quot;was startled&quot; when hearing of Agee&#x27;s plans to resign later in the year. Agee said he explained his decision from a purely personal standpoint (so as to not seem like a security risk), i.e., he had met someone, he wanted to remarry and remain in Mexico after the Olympics.

In his diary entries from October 1968—his final ones as a CIA employee—Agee condemned the Mexican government&#x27;s violence against protesters, and his own complicity in the crackdown. In particular, he cited the Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico City, which cemented his decision to resign. 

In his 1983 book &quot;KGB Today&quot;, John Barron offered a contrasting view, stating that Agee&#x27;s resignation was forced &quot;for a variety of reasons, including his irresponsible drinking, continuous and vulgar propositioning of embassy wives, and inability to manage his finances&quot;. Agee said these claims were &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks meant to discredit him.

== Allegations of links to Cuban intelligence ==
Russian exile Oleg Kalugin, former head of the KGB&#x27;s Counterintelligence Directorate, claimed that in 1973 Agee approached the KGB&#x27;s resident in Mexico City and offered a &quot;treasure trove of information.&quot; According to Kalugin, the KGB was too suspicious to accept the offer.

Kalugin writes that Agee then went to the Cubans, who &quot;welcomed him with open arms.&quot; The Cubans shared Agee&#x27;s information with the KGB, but Kalugin continued to regret the missed opportunity to have direct access to this asset.

According to Mitrokhin, while Agee was writing &quot;Inside the Company&quot;, the KGB kept in contact with him through a London correspondent of the Novosti News Agency.

Agee was accused of receiving up to US$1 million in payments from the Cuban intelligence service. He denied the accusations, which were first made by a high-ranking Cuban intelligence officer and defector in a 1992 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report.

A later &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article claimed that Agee posed as a CIA Inspector General staff member in order to target a member of the CIA Mexico City station on behalf of Cuban intelligence. According to this story, Agee was identified during a meeting by a CIA case officer.

Vasili Mitrokhin&#x27;s KGB files claim that &quot;Inside the Company: CIA Diary&quot; was &quot;prepared by Service A, together with the Cubans&quot;. Mitrokhin&#x27;s notes however do not indicate what the KGB and DGI contributed to Agee&#x27;s text. Mitrokhin claims that Agee removed all references to CIA penetration of Latin American Communist parties from his typescript before publication at the request of Service A.

In 1978, Agee began the publication of the &quot;Covert Action Information Bulletin&quot;. Mitrokhin&#x27;s files claim that the bulletin was founded on the KGB&#x27;s initiative and the group running it was &quot;put together&quot; by First Chief Directorate counter-intelligence and that Agee was the only member of the group who was aware of KGB or DGI involvement. According to Mitrokhin&#x27;s files, KGB headquarters assembled a team to keep the Bulletin supplied with material specifically designed to compromise the CIA. A document titled &quot;Director of Central Intelligence: Perspectives for Intelligence, 1976-1981&quot; was supplied to Agee by the KGB. Agee highlighted in his commentary Director of Central Intelligence William Colby&#x27;s complaint that the &quot;Covert Action Information Bulletin&quot; was among the most serious problems facing the CIA. Also from Mitrokhin&#x27;s files: In &quot;Dirty Work 2: The CIA in Africa&quot;, it is said that Agee met with Oleg Maksimovich Nechiporenko and A. N. Istkov of the KGB, and they gave him a list of CIA officers working in Africa. The files also claim that Agee decided not to identify himself as an author out of fear he would lose his residence permit in Germany.

To the end of his life, Philip Agee consistently and categorically denied ever having worked for any intelligence service after leaving the CIA. He said that his motives were purely altruistic. In support of this, he adduces the relentless persecution he endured from the CIA, as it and the U.S. State Department revoked his passport and succeeded in having him deported from several Western European countries, one after the other, until he finally found refuge in Cuba.

== &quot;Inside the Company: CIA Diary&quot; ==
Agee&#x27;s memoir of his time in the CIA was titled &quot;Inside the Company: CIA Diary&quot;. Because of legal problems in the United States, &quot;Inside the Company&quot; was first published in 1975 in Britain, while Agee was living in London. The book was delayed for six months before being published in the U.S.; it became an immediate bestseller.

In a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine interview after the book&#x27;s publication, Agee said: &quot;Millions of people all over the world had been killed or at least had their lives destroyed by the CIA ... I couldn&#x27;t just sit by and do nothing.&quot; In the book&#x27;s &quot;Acknowledgments&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Representatives of the Communist Party of Cuba also gave me important encouragement at a time when I doubted that I would be able to find the additional information I needed.&quot;

The &quot;London Evening News&quot; called &quot;Inside the Company: CIA Diary&quot; &quot;a frightening picture of corruption, pressure, assassination and conspiracy&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; called the book &quot;inescapable reading&quot;. Miles Copeland, Jr., a former CIA station chief in Cairo, said the book was &quot;as complete an account of spy work as is likely to be published anywhere&quot; and it is &quot;an authentic account of how an ordinary American or British &#x27;case officer&#x27; operates ... All of it ... is presented with deadly accuracy.&quot;

The book describes how U.S. embassies in Latin America worked with right-wing death squads, and funded anti-communist student and labour movement fronts, pro-U.S. political parties and individuals.

&quot;Inside the Company&quot; identified 250 alleged CIA officers and agents. The list of officers and agents, all personally known to Agee, appears in an appendix to the book. While written as a diary, the book actually reconstructs events based on Agee&#x27;s memory and his subsequent research.

Agee describes his first overseas assignment for the CIA in 1960 to Ecuador, where his primary mission was to force a diplomatic break between Ecuador and Cuba. He writes that the techniques he used included bribery, intimidation, bugging, and forgery. Agee spent four years in Ecuador penetrating Ecuadorian politics. He states that his actions subverted and destroyed the political fabric of Ecuador.

Agee helped bug the United Arab Republic code-room in Montevideo, Uruguay, with two contact microphones placed on the ceiling of the room below.

On December 12, 1965, Agee visited senior Uruguayan military and police officers at a Montevideo police headquarters. He realized that the screaming he heard from a nearby cell was the torturing of a Uruguayan, whose name he had given to the police as someone to watch. The Uruguayan senior officers simply turned up a radio report of a soccer game to drown out the screams.

Agee also ran CIA operations within the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games and he witnessed the events of the Tlatelolco massacre.

Agee identified President José Figueres Ferrer of Costa Rica, President Luis Echeverría Álvarez (1970–1976) of Mexico and President Alfonso López Michelsen (1974–1978) of Colombia as CIA collaborators or agents.

Following this he details how he resigned from the CIA and began writing the book, conducting research in Cuba, London and Paris. During this time, he said the CIA spied on him. The cover of the book featured an image of the bugged typewriter given to Agee by a CIA agent as part of their surveillance and attempts to stop publication of the book. According to a former CIA officer, David Atlee Phillips, when the CIA discovered that Agee was going to publish a book it began what Phillips refers to as &quot;a program of cauterization&quot;, wherein every CIA official and agent known to Agee were &quot;terminated, and some relocated for their safety; and every operation which Agee might have been privy to was being terminated&quot;. Phillips says that this cost the Agency millions of dollars.

In response to Agee&#x27;s book, the United States Congress passed the 1982 Intelligence Identities Protection Act, which made it a crime to intentionally reveal the identity of a covert intelligence officer. Use of the law was later considered during the 2003 Valerie Plame affair.

== Expulsion ==
Agee gained attention from the United Kingdom media after the publication of &quot;Inside the Company&quot;. He revealed the identities of dozens of CIA agents in the CIA London station. After numerous requests from the American government as well as an MI6 report that blamed Agee&#x27;s work for the execution of two MI6 agents in Poland, a request was put in to deport Agee from the UK. Agee fought this and was supported by MPs and journalists. The Labour MP Stan Newens promoted a parliamentary bill, gaining the support of more than 50 of his colleagues, which called for the CIA station in London to be expelled. The activity in support of Agee did not prevent his eventual deportation from the UK on June 3, 1977, when he traveled to the Netherlands. Agee was also eventually expelled from the Netherlands, France, West Germany and Italy.

On January 12, 1975, Agee testified before the second Bertrand Russell Tribunal in Brussels that in 1960 he had conducted personal name-checks of Venezuelan employees for a Venezuelan subsidiary of what is now ExxonMobil. Exxon was &quot;letting the CIA assist in employment decisions, and my guess is that those name checks ... are continuing to this day&quot;. Agee stated that the CIA customarily performed this service for subsidiaries of large U.S. corporations throughout Latin America. An Exxon spokesman denied Agee&#x27;s accusations.

In 1978, Agee and a small group of his supporters began publishing the &quot;Covert Action Information Bulletin&quot;, which promoted &quot;a worldwide campaign to destabilize the CIA through exposure of its operations and personnel&quot;. Mitrokhin states that the bulletin had help from both the KGB and the Cuban DGI. The January 1979 issue of Agee&#x27;s Bulletin published the infamous FM 30-31B, which was claimed by the United States House Intelligence Committee to be a hoax produced by the Soviet intelligence services. 
In 1978, Agee co-edited with Louis Wolf a book entitled &quot;Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe&quot;. A follow-up book, &quot;Dirty Work 2: The CIA in Africa&quot;, was published the next year. The two volumes contained information on 2,000 CIA personnel.

Agee told Swiss journalist Peter Studer: &quot;The CIA is plainly on the wrong side, that is, the capitalistic side. I approve KGB activities, communist activities in general. Between the overdone activities that the CIA initiates and the more modest activities of the KGB, there is absolutely no comparison.&quot;

Agee&#x27;s U.S. passport was revoked by the U.S. government in 1979. The State Department offered him an administrative hearing to challenge the passport revocation, but Agee instead sued in federal court. The case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled against Agee in 1981.

In 1980, Maurice Bishop&#x27;s government conferred citizenship of Grenada on Agee, and he took up residence on that island. The collapse of the Grenada Revolution removed that safe haven, and Agee then received a passport from the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. After a change of government there, this passport was revoked in 1990, and he was given a German passport, in accordance with the working status of his wife, the American ballet dancer Giselle Roberge who was working and living in Germany at the time. Agee was later readmitted to both the U.S. and United Kingdom. He recounted this period of his life in &quot;On the Run&quot;.

== Later activities ==
In the 1980s, NameBase founder Daniel Brandt taught Agee how to use computers and computer databases for his research. Agee lived with his wife principally in Hamburg, Germany and Havana, Cuba, founding the Cubalinda.com travel website in the 1990s.

U.S. President George H. W. Bush, who considered Agee a traitor, accused him of being responsible for the murder of the head of the CIA Station in Athens, Richard Welch, by the Revolutionary Organization 17 November. Bush had directed the CIA from 1976 to 1977. Agee and his friends rejected Bush&#x27;s assertion about Welch. When this accusation was included in Barbara Bush&#x27;s 1994 memoir, Agee sued her for libel. Barbara Bush agreed to remove the allegation from the paperback edition of her book as part of a legal settlement.

On December 16, 2007, Philip Agee was admitted to a hospital in Havana, and surgery was performed on him for perforated ulcers. On January 9, 2008, his wife Giselle announced that he had died in Cuba on January 7 and was cremated.

After his death, Agee&#x27;s widow gathered up all of his papers from his Havana apartment and had them sent to New York University&#x27;s Tamiment Library as a donation to the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives. According to Jonathan Stevenson, during the transport to NYU, the CIA &quot;seized the papers, combed through all of them, and confiscated an appreciable number of documents before allowing the shipment to proceed to New York.&quot;

<text>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, an early-stage pre-implantation embryo. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. Isolating the inner cell mass (embryoblast) using immunosurgery results in destruction of the blastocyst, a process which raises ethical issues, including whether or not embryos at the pre-implantation stage have the same moral considerations as embryos in the post-implantation stage of development.

Researchers are currently focusing heavily on the therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells, with clinical use being the goal for many laboratories. Potential uses include the treatment of diabetes and heart disease. The cells are being studied to be used as clinical therapies, models of genetic disorders, and cellular/DNA repair. However, adverse effects in the research and clinical processes such as tumors and unwanted immune responses have also been reported.

==Properties==
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), derived from the blastocyst stage of early mammalian embryos, are distinguished by their ability to differentiate into any embryonic cell type and by their ability to self-renew. It is these traits that makes them valuable in the scientific and medical fields. ESCs have a normal karyotype, maintain high telomerase activity, and exhibit remarkable long-term proliferative potential.

=== Pluripotent ===

Embryonic stem cells of the inner cell mass are pluripotent, meaning they are able to differentiate to generate primitive ectoderm, which ultimately differentiates during gastrulation into all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. These germ layers generate each of the more than 220 cell types in the adult human body. When provided with the appropriate signals, ESCs initially form precursor cells that in subsequently differentiate into the desired cell types. Pluripotency distinguishes embryonic stem cells from adult stem cells, which are multipotent and can only produce a limited number of cell types.

=== Self renewal and repair of structure ===

Under defined conditions, embryonic stem cells are capable of self-renewing indefinitely in an undifferentiated state. Self-renewal conditions must prevent the cells from clumping and maintain an environment that supports an unspecialized state. Typically this is done in the lab with media containing serum and leukemia inhibitory factor or serum-free media supplements with two inhibitory drugs (&quot;2i&quot;), the MEK inhibitor PD03259010 and GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR99021.

=== Growth ===

ESCs divide very frequently due to a shortened G1 phase in their cell cycle. Rapid cell division allows the cells to quickly grow in number, but not size, which is important for early embryo development. In ESCs, cyclin A and cyclin E proteins involved in the G1/S transition are always expressed at high levels. Cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK2 that promote cell cycle progression are overactive, in part due to downregulation of their inhibitors. Retinoblastoma proteins that inhibit the transcription factor E2F until the cell is ready to enter S phase are hyperphosphorylated and inactivated in ESCs, leading to continual expression of proliferation genes. These changes result in accelerated cycles of cell division. Although high expression levels of pro-proliferative proteins and a shortened G1 phase have been linked to maintenance of pluripotency, ESCs grown in serum-free 2i conditions do express hypo-phosphorylated active Retinoblastoma proteins and have an elongated G1 phase. Despite this difference in the cell cycle when compared to ESCs grown in media containing serum these cells have similar pluripotent characteristics. Pluripotency factors Oct4 and Nanog play a role in transcriptionally regulating the embryonic stem cell cycle.

=== Uses ===

Due to their plasticity and potentially unlimited capacity for self-renewal, embryonic stem cell therapies have been proposed for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease. Pluripotent stem cells have shown promise in treating a number of varying conditions, including but not limited to: spinal cord injuries, age related macular degeneration, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders (such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease), AIDS, etc. In addition to their potential in regenerative medicine, embryonic stem cells provide a possible alternative source of tissue/organs which serves as a possible solution to the donor shortage dilemma. There are some ethical controversies surrounding this though (see Ethical debate section below). Aside from these uses, ESCs can also be used for research on early human development, certain genetic disease, and &quot;in vitro&quot; toxicology testing.

==Utilizations==

According to a 2002 article in &quot;PNAS&quot;, &quot;Human embryonic stem cells have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, and, thus, may be useful as a source of cells for transplantation or tissue engineering.&quot;

=== Tissue engineering ===

In tissue engineering, the use of stem cells are known to be of importance. In order to successfully engineer a tissue, the cells used must be able to perform specific biological functions such as secretion of cytokines, signaling molecules, interacting with neighboring cells, and producing an extracellular matrix in the correct organization. Stem cells demonstrates these specific biological functions along with being able to self-renew and differentiate into one or more types of specialized cells. Embryonic stem cells is one of the sources that are being considered for the use of tissue engineering. The use of human embryonic stem cells have opened many new possibilities for tissue engineering, however, there are many hurdles that must be made before human embryonic stem cell can even be utilized. It is theorized that if embryonic stem cells can be altered to not evoke the immune response when implanted into the patient then this would be a revolutionary step in tissue engineering. Embryonic stem cells are not limited to tissue engineering.

===Cell replacement therapies===

Research has focused on differentiating ESCs into a variety of cell types for eventual use as cell replacement therapies. Some of the cell types that have or are currently being developed include cardiomyocytes, neurons, hepatocytes, bone marrow cells, islet cells and endothelial cells. However, the derivation of such cell types from ESCs is not without obstacles, therefore research has focused on overcoming these barriers. For example, studies are underway to differentiate ESCs into tissue specific cardiomyocytes and to eradicate their immature properties that distinguish them from adult cardiomyocytes.

===Clinical potential===
* Researchers have differentiated ESCs into dopamine-producing cells with the hope that these neurons could be used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
* ESCs have been differentiated to natural killer cells and bone tissue.
* Studies involving ESCs are underway to provide an alternative treatment for diabetes. For example ESCs have been differentiated into insulin-producing cells, and researchers at Harvard University were able to produce large quantities of pancreatic beta cells from ESCs.
* An article published in the &quot;European Heart Journal&quot; describes a translational process of generating human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells to be used in clinical trials of patients with severe heart failure.

===Drug discovery===

Besides becoming an important alternative to organ transplants, ESCs are also being used in the field of toxicology, and as cellular screens to uncover new chemical entities that can be developed as small-molecule drugs. Studies have shown that cardiomyocytes derived from ESCs are validated &quot;in vitro&quot; models to test drug responses and predict toxicity profiles. ESC derived cardiomyocytes have been shown to respond to pharmacological stimuli and hence can be used to assess cardiotoxicity such as torsades de pointes.

ESC-derived hepatocytes are also useful models that could be used in the preclinical stages of drug discovery. However, the development of hepatocytes from ESCs has proven to be challenging and this hinders the ability to test drug metabolism. Therefore, research has focused on establishing fully functional ESC-derived hepatocytes with stable phase I and II enzyme activity.

===Models of genetic disorder===
Several new studies have started to address the concept of modeling genetic disorders with embryonic stem cells. Either by genetically manipulating the cells, or more recently, by deriving diseased cell lines identified by prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD), modeling genetic disorders is something that has been accomplished with stem cells. This approach may very well prove valuable at studying disorders such as Fragile-X syndrome, Cystic fibrosis, and other genetic maladies that have no reliable model system.

Yury Verlinsky, a Russian-American medical researcher who specialized in embryo and cellular genetics (genetic cytology), developed prenatal diagnosis testing methods to determine genetic and chromosomal disorders a month and a half earlier than standard amniocentesis. The techniques are now used by many pregnant women and prospective parents, especially couples who have a history of genetic abnormalities or where the woman is over the age of 35 (when the risk of genetically related disorders is higher). In addition, by allowing parents to select an embryo without genetic disorders, they have the potential of saving the lives of siblings that already had similar disorders and diseases using cells from the disease free offspring.

===Repair of DNA damage===
Differentiated somatic cells and ES cells use different strategies for dealing with DNA damage. For instance, human foreskin fibroblasts, one type of somatic cell, use non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), an error prone DNA repair process, as the primary pathway for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) during all cell cycle stages. Because of its error-prone nature, NHEJ tends to produce mutations in a cell&#x27;s clonal descendants.

ES cells use a different strategy to deal with DSBs. Because ES cells give rise to all of the cell types of an organism including the cells of the germ line, mutations arising in ES cells due to faulty DNA repair are a more serious problem than in differentiated somatic cells. Consequently, robust mechanisms are needed in ES cells to repair DNA damages accurately, and if repair fails, to remove those cells with un-repaired DNA damages. Thus, mouse ES cells predominantly use high fidelity homologous recombinational repair (HRR) to repair DSBs. This type of repair depends on the interaction of the two sister chromosomes formed during S phase and present together during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. HRR can accurately repair DSBs in one sister chromosome by using intact information from the other sister chromosome. Cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (i.e. after metaphase/cell division but prior the next round of replication) have only one copy of each chromosome (i.e. sister chromosomes aren&#x27;t present). Mouse ES cells lack a G1 checkpoint and do not undergo cell cycle arrest upon acquiring DNA damage. Rather they undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to DNA damage. Apoptosis can be used as a fail-safe strategy to remove cells with un-repaired DNA damages in order to avoid mutation and progression to cancer. Consistent with this strategy, mouse ES stem cells have a mutation frequency about 100-fold lower than that of isogenic mouse somatic cells.

===Clinical trial===

On January 23, 2009, Phase I clinical trials for transplantation of oligodendrocytes (a cell type of the brain and spinal cord) derived from human ESCs into spinal cord-injured individuals received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), marking it the world&#x27;s first human ESC human trial. The study leading to this scientific advancement was conducted by Hans Keirstead and colleagues at the University of California, Irvine and supported by Geron Corporation of Menlo Park, CA, founded by Michael D. West, PhD. A previous experiment had shown an improvement in locomotor recovery in spinal cord-injured rats after a 7-day delayed transplantation of human ESCs that had been pushed into an oligodendrocytic lineage. The phase I clinical study was designed to enroll about eight to ten paraplegics who have had their injuries no longer than two weeks before the trial begins, since the cells must be injected before scar tissue is able to form. The researchers emphasized that the injections were not expected to fully cure the patients and restore all mobility. Based on the results of the rodent trials, researchers speculated that restoration of myelin sheathes and an increase in mobility might occur. This first trial was primarily designed to test the safety of these procedures and if everything went well, it was hoped that it would lead to future studies that involve people with more severe disabilities. The trial was put on hold in August 2009 due to FDA concerns regarding a small number of microscopic cysts found in several treated rat models but the hold was lifted on July 30, 2010.

In October 2010 researchers enrolled and administered ESCs to the first patient at Shepherd Center in Atlanta. The makers of the stem cell therapy, Geron Corporation, estimated that it would take several months for the stem cells to replicate and for the GRNOPC1 therapy to be evaluated for success or failure.

In November 2011 Geron announced it was halting the trial and dropping out of stem cell research for financial reasons, but would continue to monitor existing patients, and was attempting to find a partner that could continue their research. In 2013 BioTime, led by CEO Dr. Michael D. West, acquired all of Geron&#x27;s stem cell assets, with the stated intention of restarting Geron&#x27;s embryonic stem cell-based clinical trial for spinal cord injury research.

BioTime company Asterias Biotherapeutics (NYSE MKT: AST) was granted a $14.3 million Strategic Partnership Award by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to re-initiate the world&#x27;s first embryonic stem cell-based human clinical trial, for spinal cord injury. Supported by California public funds, CIRM is the largest funder of stem cell-related research and development in the world.

The award provides funding for Asterias to reinitiate clinical development of AST-OPC1 in subjects with spinal cord injury and to expand clinical testing of escalating doses in the target population intended for future pivotal trials.

AST-OPC1 is a population of cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that contains oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). OPCs and their mature derivatives called oligodendrocytes provide critical functional support for nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain. Asterias recently presented the results from phase 1 clinical trial testing of a low dose of AST-OPC1 in patients with neurologically complete thoracic spinal cord injury. The results showed that AST-OPC1 was successfully delivered to the injured spinal cord site. Patients followed 2–3 years after AST-OPC1 administration showed no evidence of serious adverse events associated with the cells in detailed follow-up assessments including frequent neurological exams and MRIs. Immune monitoring of subjects through one year post-transplantation showed no evidence of antibody-based or cellular immune responses to AST-OPC1. In four of the five subjects, serial MRI scans performed throughout the 2–3 year follow-up period indicate that reduced spinal cord cavitation may have occurred and that AST-OPC1 may have had some positive effects in reducing spinal cord tissue deterioration. There was no unexpected neurological degeneration or improvement in the five subjects in the trial as evaluated by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) exam.

The Strategic Partnership III grant from CIRM will provide funding to Asterias to support the next clinical trial of AST-OPC1 in subjects with spinal cord injury, and for Asterias&#x27; product development efforts to refine and scale manufacturing methods to support later-stage trials and eventually commercialization. CIRM funding will be conditional on FDA approval for the trial, completion of a definitive agreement between Asterias and CIRM, and Asterias&#x27; continued progress toward the achievement of certain pre-defined project milestones.

==Concern and controversy==
===Adverse effects===
The major concern with the possible transplantation of ESCs into patients as therapies is their ability to form tumors including teratomas. Safety issues prompted the FDA to place a hold on the first ESC clinical trial, however no tumors were observed.

The main strategy to enhance the safety of ESCs for potential clinical use is to differentiate the ESCs into specific cell types (e.g. neurons, muscle, liver cells) that have reduced or eliminated ability to cause tumors. Following differentiation, the cells are subjected to sorting by flow cytometry for further purification. ESCs are predicted to be inherently safer than iPS cells created with genetically integrating viral vectors because they are not genetically modified with genes such as c-Myc that are linked to cancer. Nonetheless, ESCs express very high levels of the iPS inducing genes and these genes including Myc are essential for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency, and potential strategies to improve safety by eliminating c-Myc expression are unlikely to preserve the cells&#x27; &quot;stemness&quot;. However, N-myc and L-myc have been identified to induce iPS cells instead of c-myc with similar efficiency. Later protocols to induce pluripotency bypass these problems completely by using non-integrating RNA viral vectors such as sendai virus or mRNA transfection.

===Ethical debate===

Due to the nature of embryonic stem cell research, there are a lot of controversial opinions on the topic. Since harvesting embryonic stem cells usually necessitates destroying the embryo from which those cells are obtained, the moral status of the embryo comes into question. Some people claim that the embryo is too young to achieve personhood or that the embryo, if donated from an IVF clinic (where labs typically acquire embryos), would otherwise go to medical waste anyway. Opponents of ESC research claim that an embryo is a human life, therefore destroying it is murder and the embryo must be protected under the same ethical view as a more developed human being.

==History==
* 1964: Lewis Kleinsmith and G. Barry Pierce Jr. isolated a single type of cell from a teratocarcinoma, a tumor now known from a germ cell. These cells were isolated from the teratocarcinoma replicated and grew in cell culture as a stem cell and are now known as embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Although similarities in morphology and differentiating potential (pluripotency) led to the use of EC cells as the &quot;in vitro&quot; model for early mouse development, EC cells harbor genetic mutations and often abnormal karyotypes that accumulated during the development of the teratocarcinoma. These genetic aberrations further emphasized the need to be able to culture pluripotent cells directly from the inner cell mass.

* 1981: Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) were independently first derived from a mouse embryos by two groups. Martin Evans and Matthew Kaufman from the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge published first in July, revealing a new technique for culturing the mouse embryos in the uterus to allow for an increase in cell number, allowing for the derivation of ES cell from these embryos. Gail R. Martin, from the Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, published her paper in December and coined the term &quot;Embryonic Stem Cell&quot;. She showed that embryos could be cultured &quot;in vitro&quot; and that ES cells could be derived from these embryos.
* 1989: Mario R. Cappechi, Martin J. Evans, and Oliver Smithies publish their research that details their isolation and genetic modifications of embryonic stem cells, creating the first &quot;knockout mice&quot;. In creating knockout mice, this publication provided scientists with an entirely new way to study disease.
* 1996: Dolly, was the first mammal cloned from an adult cell by the Roslin Institute of the University of Edinburgh. This experiment instituted the proposition that specialized adult cells obtain the genetic makeup to perform a specific task; which established a basis for further research within a variety of cloning techniques. The Dolly experiment was performed by obtaining the mammalian udder cells from a sheep (Dolly) and differentiating these cells until division was concluded. An egg cell was then procured from a different sheep host and the nucleus was removed. An udder cell was placed next to the egg cell and connected by electricity causing this cell to share DNA. This egg cell differentiated into an embryo and the embryo was inserted into a third sheep which gave birth to the clone version of Dolly.
* 1998: A team from the University of Wisconsin, Madison (James A. Thomson, Joseph Itskovitz-Eldor, Sander S. Shapiro, Michelle A. Waknitz, Jennifer J. Swiergiel, Vivienne S. Marshall, and Jeffrey M. Jones) publish a paper titled &quot;Embryonic Stem Cell Lines Derived From Human Blastocysts&quot;. The researchers behind this study not only created the first embryonic stem cells, but recognized their pluripotency, as well as their capacity for self-renewal. The abstract of the paper notes the significance of the discovery with regards to the fields of developmental biology and drug discovery.
* 2001: President George W. Bush allows federal funding to support research on roughly 60—at this time, already existing—lines of embryonic stem cells. Seeing as the limited lines that Bush allowed research on had already been established, this law supported embryonic stem cell research without raising any ethical questions that could arise with the creation of new lines under federal budget.
* 2006: Japanese scientists Shinya Yamanaka and Kazutoshi Takashi publish a paper describing the induction of pluripotent stem cells from cultures of adult mouse fibroblasts. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a huge discovery, as they are seemingly identical to embryonic stem cells and could be used without sparking the same moral controversy.
* January, 2009: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides approval for Geron Corporation&#x27;s phase I trial of their human embryonic stem cell-derived treatment for spinal cord injuries. The announcement was met with excitement from the scientific community, but also with wariness from stem cell opposers. The treatment cells were, however, derived from the cell lines approved under George W. Bush&#x27;s ESC policy.
* March, 2009: Executive Order 13505 is signed by President Barack Obama, removing the restrictions put in place on federal funding for human stem cells by the previous presidential administration. This would allow the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to provide funding for hESC research. The document also states that the NIH must provide revised federal funding guidelines within 120 days of the order&#x27;s signing.

==Techniques and conditions for derivation and culture==

===Derivation from humans===
In vitro fertilization generates multiple embryos. The surplus of embryos is not clinically used or is unsuitable for implantation into the patient, and therefore may be donated by the donor with consent. Human embryonic stem cells can be derived from these donated embryos or additionally they can also be extracted from cloned embryos created using a cell from a patient and a donated egg through the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer. The inner cell mass (cells of interest), from the blastocyst stage of the embryo, is separated from the trophectoderm, the cells that would differentiate into extra-embryonic tissue. Immunosurgery, the process in which antibodies are bound to the trophectoderm and removed by another solution, and mechanical dissection are performed to achieve separation. The resulting inner cell mass cells are plated onto cells that will supply support. The inner cell mass cells attach and expand further to form a human embryonic cell line, which are undifferentiated. These cells are fed daily and are enzymatically or mechanically separated every four to seven days. For differentiation to occur, the human embryonic stem cell line is removed from the supporting cells to form embryoid bodies, is co-cultured with a serum containing necessary signals, or is grafted in a three-dimensional scaffold to result.

===Derivation from other animals===

Embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the early embryo, which are harvested from the donor mother animal. Martin Evans and Matthew Kaufman reported a technique that delays embryo implantation, allowing the inner cell mass to increase. This process includes removing the donor mother&#x27;s ovaries and dosing her with progesterone, changing the hormone environment, which causes the embryos to remain free in the uterus. After 4–6 days of this intrauterine culture, the embryos are harvested and grown in &quot;in vitro&quot; culture until the inner cell mass forms “egg cylinder-like structures,” which are dissociated into single cells, and plated on fibroblasts treated with mitomycin-c (to prevent fibroblast mitosis). Clonal cell lines are created by growing up a single cell. Evans and Kaufman showed that the cells grown out from these cultures could form teratomas and embryoid bodies, and differentiate &quot;in vitro,&quot; all of which indicating that the cells are pluripotent.

Gail Martin derived and cultured her ES cells differently. She removed the embryos from the donor mother at approximately 76 hours after copulation and cultured them overnight in a medium containing serum. The following day, she removed the inner cell mass from the late blastocyst using microsurgery. The extracted inner cell mass was cultured on fibroblasts treated with mitomycin-c in a medium containing serum and conditioned by ES cells. After approximately one week, colonies of cells grew out. These cells grew in culture and demonstrated pluripotent characteristics, as demonstrated by the ability to form teratomas, differentiate &quot;in vitro,&quot; and form embryoid bodies. Martin referred to these cells as ES cells.

It is now known that the feeder cells provide leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum provides bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that are necessary to prevent ES cells from differentiating. These factors are extremely important for the efficiency of deriving ES cells. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that different mouse strains have different efficiencies for isolating ES cells. Current uses for mouse ES cells include the generation of transgenic mice, including knockout mice. For human treatment, there is a need for patient specific pluripotent cells. Generation of human ES cells is more difficult and faces ethical issues. So, in addition to human ES cell research, many groups are focused on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells).

===Potential methods for new cell line derivation===
On August 23, 2006, the online edition of &quot;Nature&quot; scientific journal published a letter by Dr. Robert Lanza (medical director of Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, MA) stating that his team had found a way to extract embryonic stem cells without destroying the actual embryo. This technical achievement would potentially enable scientists to work with new lines of embryonic stem cells derived using public funding in the US, where federal funding was at the time limited to research using embryonic stem cell lines derived prior to August 2001. In March, 2009, the limitation was lifted.

Human embryonic stem cells have also been derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This approach has also sometimes been referred to as &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; because SCNT bears similarity to other kinds of cloning in that nuclei are transferred from a somatic cell into an enucleated zygote. However, in this case SCNT was used to produce embryonic stem cell lines in a lab, not living organisms via a pregnancy. The &quot;therapeutic&quot; part of the name is included because of the hope that SCNT produced embryonic stem cells could have clinical utility.

===Induced pluripotent stem cells===
The iPS cell technology was pioneered by Shinya Yamanaka&#x27;s lab in Kyoto, Japan, who showed in 2006 that the introduction of four specific genes encoding transcription factors could convert adult cells into pluripotent stem cells. He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize along with Sir John Gurdon &quot;for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent.&quot;

In 2007, it was shown that pluripotent stem cells, highly similar to embryonic stem cells, can be induced by the delivery of four factors (&quot;Oct3/4&quot;, &quot;Sox2&quot;, c-Myc, and &quot;Klf4&quot;) to differentiated cells. Utilizing the four genes previously listed, the differentiated cells are &quot;reprogrammed&quot; into pluripotent stem cells, allowing for the generation of pluripotent/embryonic stem cells without the embryo. The morphology and growth factors of these lab induced pluripotent cells, are equivalent to embryonic stem cells, leading these cells to be known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). This observation was observed in mouse pluripotent stem cells, originally, but now can be performed in human adult fibroblasts using the same four genes. 

Because ethical concerns regarding embryonic stem cells typically are about their derivation from terminated embryos, it is believed that reprogramming to these iPS cells may be less controversial. 

This may enable the generation of patient specific ES cell lines that could potentially be used for cell replacement therapies. In addition, this will allow the generation of ES cell lines from patients with a variety of genetic diseases and will provide invaluable models to study those diseases.

However, as a first indication that the iPS cell technology can in rapid succession lead to new cures, it was used by a research team headed by Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to cure mice of sickle cell anemia, as reported by &quot;Science&quot; journal&#x27;s online edition on December 6, 2007.

On January 16, 2008, a California-based company, Stemagen, announced that they had created the first mature cloned human embryos from single skin cells taken from adults. These embryos can be harvested for patient matching embryonic stem cells.

===Contamination by reagents used in cell culture===
The online edition of &quot;Nature Medicine&quot; published a study on January 24, 2005, which stated that the human embryonic stem cells available for federally funded research are contaminated with non-human molecules from the culture medium used to grow the cells. It is a common technique to use mouse cells and other animal cells to maintain the pluripotency of actively dividing stem cells. The problem was discovered when non-human sialic acid in the growth medium was found to compromise the potential uses of the embryonic stem cells in humans, according to scientists at the University of California, San Diego.

However, a study published in the online edition of &quot;Lancet Medical Journal&quot; on March 8, 2005, detailed information about a new stem cell line that was derived from human embryos under completely cell- and serum-free conditions. After more than 6 months of undifferentiated proliferation, these cells demonstrated the potential to form derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers both &quot;in vitro&quot; and in teratomas. These properties were also successfully maintained (for more than 30 passages) with the established stem cell lines.

===Muse cells===
Muse cells (Multi-lineage differentiating stress enduring cell) are non-cancerous pluripotent stem cell found in adults. They were discovered in 2010 by Mari Dezawa and her research group. Muse cells reside in the connective tissue of nearly every organ including the umbilical cord, bone marrow and peripheral blood. They are collectable from commercially obtainable mesenchymal cells such as human fibroblasts, bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells. Muse cells are able to generate cells representative of all three germ layers from a single cell both spontaneously and under cytokine induction. Expression of pluripotency genes and triploblastic differentiation are self-renewable over generations. Muse cells do not undergo teratoma formation when transplanted into a host environment in vivo, eradicating the risk of tumorigenesis through unbridled cell proliferation.

<text>Sir John Boys (1607 – 8 October 1664) is best known as the Royalist Governor of Donnington Castle in Berkshire during the English Civil War.

==Early life==
Boys was born in at Bonnington, near to Goodnestone, in Kent, the eldest son and heir of Edward Boys of Bonnington, by Jane, a daughter of Edward Sanders (of Northborne). He was baptized at Chillenden, on 5 April 1607.

In 1641, John Boys was promoted from captain to lieutenant colonel when he came to serve the King in John Savage, Earl Rivers&#x27;s Regiment in Ireland. He was colonel in all but name, however, as Earl Rivers never took command of the Regiment in the field.

==Defence of Donnington Castle==
Donnington Castle is located north of the town of Newbury. It was garrisoned in 1643 for King Charles I and commanded the road from Oxford to Southampton and the road from London to Bath. It was, from 1643, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Boys, who spent £1,000 on earthworks to strengthen the defences. Boys commanded a division of the Earl Rivers&#x27;s Royalist Regiment consisting of 200 foot, 25 horse, and 4 guns, which remained throughout the siege.

On 31 July 1644, Donnington Castle was attacked by a division of the New Model Army of 3000 horses and dragoons, under the command of Lieutenant-General John Middleton, but without any artillery support. Middleton attempted to compel a surrender from Boys, but the Parliamentary army was repulsed with the loss of at least 300 men.

About a month later, on 29 September, Colonel Jeremy Horton began a 12-day blockade laying siege to Donnington, having raised a battery at the foot of the hill, near Newbury he was able to shatter the southern towers of the castles medieval defenses and reduce a part of the wall to rubble. It has been estimated that at least 1000 missiles were fired against the fortress during this engagement. Even though Colonel Horton had been reinforced, Governor John Boys refused to concede and even invited Horton to surrender his forces.

A parliamentarian army soon after returned on 4 October led by the Earl of Manchester. An attempt to storm the castle failed, but the bombardment continued for several days without avail. Frustrated, the whole army dispersed as Charles I, at the head of the Royal army, moved towards Donnington. For his great services in defense of the castle Governor John Boys was knighted on 21 October 1644. The king also promoted him to full colonel in Earl Rivers&#x27;s Regiment.

On 27 October, the second battle of Newbury was fought, and Colonel Sir John Boys secured the King&#x27;s artillery under the walls of Donnington castle. The famous Parliamentarian soldier Sir William Waller surrounded the castle with his army and again Boys refused to surrender.

After the battle of Newbury, when the King had gone to Oxford, the Earl of Essex besieged Donnington Castle, but abandoned the attempt before Charles returned in the first week of November 1644 to relieve Donnington. The King took his &quot;treasure and guns,&quot; leaving some of the heavier pieces for use by the garrison.

Some time after 14 November 1645, Oliver Cromwell himself turned his attention to the problem of the Royalist stronghold of Donnington castle, and in the following spring a furious bombardment with cannon and mortars was ordered. By 30 March a truce was concluded, and Charles had no option other than to instruct Boys to obtain the best possible surrender. On 1 April 1646, the surrender was completed, wherein garrison was permitted to march to the Royalist garrison at Wallingford Castle with their colours flying and drums beating. Boys did not join them, instead he went to London rather than take part in any further military resistance.

==Later history==
He was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1646. During August 1648, he made a futile attempt to raise the Siege of Walmer Castle in Deal, one of the Cinque Ports, and customary home of the Lord Warden. Sir Algernon Sydney replaced him as Warden in 1648.

In 1659, Boys was held as a prisoner in Dover Castle for &quot;petitioning for a free Parliament&quot;, but was released on 23 February 1660. He was then, reputedly, granted the office of Receiver of Customs at Dover from Charles II.

A few years later, on 8 October 1664, Sir John Boys died at his house at Bonnington and was buried in the parish church of Goodnestone-next-Wingham (near Canterbury) in Kent.

==Personal life==
He was married three times, and had five daughters by his first wife Lucy.
His second marriage was to Ann Brockman, daughter of Sir William Brockman of Newington-next-Hythe in 1650. She died in 1651.
His third marriage was to the Lady Elizabeth Finch, widow of Sir Nathaniel Finch, and a daughter of Sir John Fotherby of Barham (Kent).

<text>The Lottery is a short story by Shirley Jackson that was first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on June 26, 1948. The story describes a fictional small American community that observes an annual tradition known as &quot;the lottery&quot;, which is intended to ensure a good harvest and purge the town of bad omens. The lottery, its preparations, and its execution are all described in detail, though it is not revealed until the end what actually happens to the person selected by the random lottery: the selected member of the community is stoned to death by the other townspeople.

Jackson and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; were both surprised by the initial negative response from readers; subscriptions were canceled and large amounts of hate mail were sent throughout the summer of its first publication, with Jackson receiving at least 10 letters per day. The Union of South Africa banned the story because some parts of Africa still used stoning as a punishment.

The story has been dramatized several times, including as a radio drama, film, and graphic novel. It has been subjected to considerable sociological and literary analysis and has been described as one of the most famous short stories in the history of American literature.

==Plot== 
Details of contemporary small-town American life are embroidered upon a description of an annual rite known as &quot;the lottery&quot;. In a small, unnamed village of about 300 residents, the locals are in an excited yet nervous mood on June 27. Children pile up stones as the adults assemble for their annual event, practiced to ensure a good harvest; Old Man Warner quotes an old proverb, &quot;Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.&quot; However, some nearby villages have already discontinued the lottery, and rumors are spreading that others are considering doing the same. Some in the village respond that the lottery has always been conducted and should continue every year henceforth.

The lottery preparations start the night before, with coal merchant Mr. Summers and postmaster Mr. Graves drawing up a list of all the extended families in town and preparing one paper slip per family. The slips are folded and placed in an age-stained black wooden box which is stored in a safe at Mr. Summers&#x27; office until the lottery is scheduled to begin. 

The initial drawing takes place to choose one family. There is a sense of relief in those not chosen and in one case a family member is sent to pass word to their injured father that their family was not picked. Bill Hutchinson draws the only marked slip in the box, and his wife Tessie complains that he was rushed into making his choice. Since their family consists of only one household, the second drawing to choose a household is skipped.

For the final drawing, one slip is placed in the box for each member of the Hutchinson household: Bill, Tessie, and each of their three children. Each of the five draws a slip, and Tessie gets the marked one. The townspeople, including Tessie&#x27;s young son Davy, pick up the gathered stones and begin throwing them at her as Tessie screams about the unfairness of the lottery.

==Reception==
===Readers===
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; received a &quot;torrent of letters&quot; inquiring about the story, &quot;the most mail the magazine had ever received in response to a work of fiction&quot;. Many readers demanded an explanation of the situation in the story, and a month after the initial publication, Jackson responded in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; (July 22, 1948):

Jackson lived in North Bennington, Vermont, and her comment reveals that she had Bennington in mind when she wrote &quot;The Lottery&quot;. In a 1960 lecture (printed in her 1968 collection &quot;Come Along with Me&quot;) she recalled the hate mail she received in 1948:
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; kept no records of the phone calls, but letters addressed to Jackson were forwarded to her. That summer she regularly took home 10 to 12 forwarded letters each day. She also received weekly packages from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; containing letters and questions addressed to the magazine or editor Harold Ross, plus carbon copies of the magazine&#x27;s responses mailed to letter writers.

===Critical interpretations===
Helen E. Nebeker&#x27;s essay The Lottery&#x27;: Symbolic Tour de Force&quot; in &quot;American Literature&quot; (March 1974) claims that every major name in the story has a special significance.
Fritz Oehlschlaeger, in &quot;The Stoning of Mistress Hutchinson: Meaning and Context in &#x27;The Lottery (&quot;Essays in Literature&quot;, 1988), wrote:
The 1992 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Dog of Death&quot; features a scene referring to &quot;The Lottery&quot;. During the peak of the lottery fever in Springfield, news anchor Kent Brockman announces on television that people hoping to get tips on how to win the jackpot have borrowed every available copy of Shirley Jackson&#x27;s book &quot;The Lottery&quot; at the local library. One of them is Homer, who throws the book into the fire after Brockman reveals that &quot;Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad.&quot; In her book &quot;Shirley Jackson: Essays on the Literary Legacy&quot;, Bernice Murphy comments that this scene displays some of the most contradictory things about Jackson: &quot;It says a lot about the visibility of Jackson&#x27;s most notorious tale that more than 50 years after its initial creation it is still famous enough to warrant a mention in the world&#x27;s most famous sitcom. The fact that Springfield&#x27;s citizenry also miss the point of Jackson&#x27;s story completely ... can perhaps be seen as an indication of a more general misrepresentation of Jackson and her work.&quot;

In &quot;Arbitrary Condemnation and Sanctioned Violence in Shirley Jackson&#x27;s &#x27;The Lottery (December 2004), Patrick J. Shields suggests there is a connection between the death penalty and &quot;The Lottery&quot; when writing:
Others have made comparisons between the lottery and the military draft, whereby young men aged 18–25 were selected at random for military service by the Selective Service System. The story was written just three years after the end of World War II, in which ten million American men were drafted and over 400,000 died, and was published just two days after the enactment of the Military Selective Service Act, which re-established the draft.

==Adaptations==
In addition to numerous reprints in magazines, anthologies, and textbooks as well as comic adaptation, &quot;The Lottery&quot; has been adapted for radio, live television, a 1953 ballet, films in 1969 and 1997, a TV movie, an opera, and a one-act play by Thomas Martin.

===1951 radio version===
A radio adaptation by NBC was broadcast March 14, 1951, as an episode of the anthology series &quot;NBC Presents: Short Story&quot;. Writer Ernest Kinoy expanded the plot to include scenes at various characters&#x27; homes before the lottery and a conversation between Bill and Tessie Hutchinson (Bill suggests leaving town before the lottery happens, but Tessie refuses because she wants to go shopping at Floyd Summers&#x27;s store after the lottery is over). Kinoy deleted certain characters, including two of the Hutchinsons&#x27; three children, and added at least one character, John Gunderson, a schoolteacher who publicly objects to the lottery being held, and at first refuses to draw. Finally, Kinoy included an ending scene describing the townspeople&#x27;s post-lottery activities and an afterword, in which the narrator suggested: &quot;Next year, maybe there won&#x27;t be a Lottery. It&#x27;s up to all of us. Chances are, there will be, though.&quot; The production was directed by Andrew C. Love.

===Television adaptations===
Ellen M. Violett wrote the first television adaptation, seen on Albert McCleery&#x27;s &quot;Cameo Theatre&quot; (1950–1955).

The story served as the inspiration for the 2008 &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Britney&#x27;s New Look&quot;.

The story was also parodied in the 2014 &quot;Regular Show&quot; episode &quot;Terror Tales of the Park IV&quot;, in the segment &quot;The Hole&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Wonderful Adventure of the Mysterious Hole in the Park&quot;), described as &quot;reimagining some classic literature&quot;.

===1969 film===
Larry Yust&#x27;s short film &quot;The Lottery&quot; (1969), produced as part of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;″s &quot;Short Story Showcase&quot; series, was ranked by the Academic Film Archive &quot;as one of the two bestselling educational films ever&quot;. It has an accompanying ten-minute commentary film &quot;Discussion of &quot;The Lottery&quot;&quot; by University of Southern California English professor James Durbin. Featuring Ed Begley Jr. as Jack Watson in his third film, Yust&#x27;s adaptation has an atmosphere of naturalism and small-town authenticity with its shots of pickup trucks in Fellows, California, and the townspeople of Fellows and Taft, California.

===1996 TV film===
Anthony Spinner&#x27;s feature-length TV film &quot;The Lottery&quot;, which premiered September 29, 1996, on NBC, expands upon the original Shirley Jackson story. It was nominated for a 1997 Saturn Award for Best Single Genre Television Presentation.

===Graphic novel===
In 2016, Miles Hyman, a grandson of Jackson, created a graphic novel adaption titled &quot;Shirley Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lottery&quot;: The Authorized Graphic Adaptation&quot;. His version abbreviates the wording of the source work and relies on graphics to portray other aspects of the narrative. He also wrote his own introduction. Alyson Ward of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote the graphics &quot;push a little further than his grandmother&#x27;s words did&quot;, though she stated Hyman&#x27;s version reveals details of the story earlier than in the original work.

In the 2010 video game &quot;&quot;, a location in the game, Vault 11, takes inspirations from the story, with the main differences being a tangible threat instead of the superficial threat of a bad harvest and that the decision is made by election rather than lottery. At another point in the game, a faction inspired by Ancient Roman soldiers known as &#x27;Caesar&#x27;s Legion&#x27; holds a lottery in the town of Nipton, California, although in this case the &#x27;winner&#x27; is set free, while it is everyone else (with the exception of the second place runner-up, who has his legs broken, and the third place runners-up, who are enslaved) who are either decapitated, crucified, or, in the case of the mayor, burned.

===Music===
Marilyn Manson used &quot;The Lottery&quot; as inspiration for his music video for the song &quot;Man That You Fear&quot; of his album &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. 

The Used released a song based on the book by the same name, &quot;The Lottery&quot; on their 2020 album &quot;Heartwork&quot;.

<text>The Cygnet (or Aerodrome #5) was an extremely unorthodox early Canadian aircraft, with a wall-like &quot;wing&quot; made up of 3,393 tetrahedral cells. It was a powered version of the Cygnet tetrahedral kite designed by Dr Alexander Graham Bell in 1907 and built by the newly founded Aerial Experiment Association.

==Design and development==
Bell&#x27;s experiments with tetrahedral kites had explored the advantages of utilizing great banks of cells to create a lifting body leading to the Cygnet I. On 6 December 1907, Thomas Selfridge piloted the kite as it was towed into the air behind a motorboat, eventually reaching a height of 168 ft (51 m). This was the first recorded heavier-than-air flight in Canada. While demonstrably able to fly as a person-carrying kite, it seemed unpromising as a direction for research into powered flight. It was difficult to control, and was in fact destroyed when it hit the water at the end of the flight.

The following year, a smaller copy of the design was built as the Cygnet II, now equipped with wheeled undercarriage and a Curtiss V-8 engine.

==Operational history==
Attempts to fly the Cygnet II at Baddeck, Nova Scotia between 22 and 24 February 1909, met with failure. When the AEA Silver Dart was ready for flight testing, the engine was removed from the Cygnet II, and then returned. Rebuilt again as the Cygnet III with a more powerful 70 hp Gnome Gamma engine, its final flight was on 19 March 1912, at Bras d&#x27;Or Lake, Nova Scotia, piloted by John McCurdy. The results were highly unsatisfactory with the Cygnet III only able to lift off the ground for a foot or two, typically considered remaining in ground effect. After a final trial on 17 March, the tetrahedral cell bank failed structurally, leaving the aircraft irreparably damaged. The Cygnet II and III were abandoned following this flight attempt.

He has received prizes for several of his books and films, as well as for his entire work. From 1966 until his retirement in 2005, he was lecturer in Numerical analysis at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

== Biography ==
&quot;Peter Pohl&quot; was born on 5 December 1940 in Hamburg, Germany.
He lost his father during World War II and moved to Sweden with his mother in 1945, where he started school in 1947.
He went to the &quot;Södra Latin&quot; gymnasium in Stockholm until 1959.

From his 15th until his 30th (1970), Pohl was part of the schools summer camp at Värmdö and later at Blidö.
This period of his life is described in the books that form the Rainbow Series and are of particular influence of his other books.

He studied mathematics and physics and was a research assistant at the Swedish National Defence Research Institute for several years, starting in 1963.
Pohl soon returned to university in order to graduate at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where he received his doctorate in Numerical analysis in 1975.
He became a lecturer in Numerical analysis and wrote several textbooks on this subject.

Pohl started filming in 1980 and won various prizes for his work.
His writing career started in 1983 and two years later he published his first and most successful book, translated in English as &quot;Johnny, My Friend&quot;.
Since then, he has published () 26 works of fiction.

He retired as a lecturer in 2005.

== Director ==
Before he published his first book, Pohl created a number of short films.
Most of them were published in the 1980s and many have won various prizes, from, among others, the Union Internationale du Cinéma, Swedish short film and video, and Nordic short film.

Pohl has made a number of short films, mainly in the 1980s.

== Author ==
Pohl has published a total number of 35 books: 9 textbooks and 26 works of fiction. He is primarily known for his works of fiction.

His fiction is mostly drama, but also includes two works of poetry, a book with fairy tales and a &quot;picture book without pictures&quot; that defies categorisation.
In most of his books, children and teenagers are the main characters.
He considers this to be the most important period of a life.
Typical themes are loneliness, betrayal, lies, a longing for friendship, death.
On his website, he writes that he does so because it is reality for many adults, youths and kids, and it would be a shame to be silent about that.

Of his drama, two books were translated into English: Johnny, My Friend about a mysterious new boy in the neighborhood, and I miss you, I miss you! about the loss of a twin sister.
In total, 13 of his books have been translated into 13 languages, mostly in Norwegian, Danish and German, but more recently also in languages such as Estonian and Polish.

Among the books he published in the first four years of his writer career are three of the autobiographical books that form the rainbow series.
Those are true and about his own life
Those start with Regnbågen har bara åtta färger (&quot;The rainbow has only eight colours&quot;).
In this book, Pohl described his early childhood, starting immediately after he moved to Sweden, until he was eight years old.
The story takes place between 1945 and 1948.
It is followed by Medan regnbågen bleknar (&quot;While the rainbow is fading&quot;), covering the period 1949 – 1952.
Vilja växa (&quot;Want to grow up&quot;) described the period 1952 – 1958.
The fourth book, Vi kallar honom Anna, he describes one year, particularly one summer, where he, part of the summercamp organisation, observes how a teenage boy is severely bullied.
This book was published before &quot;Medan regnbågen bleknar&quot; and &quot;Vilja växa&quot;, just shortly after &quot;Regnbågen har bara åtta färger&quot;, and received a lot of attention and prizes.
The final book in the series is Klara papper är ett måste, which starts in 1966.
Additionally, the book De Stora Penslarnas lek, which Pohl describes as a starting point for his writing, contains fairy tales, based on the fairy tales from the grandfather in &quot;Regnbågen har bara åtta färger&quot;.

Other books, such as I miss you, I miss you! (co-written with Kinna Gieth) and Sekten are based on true stories that came to him directly or indirectly.

Some of his books were originally published as adult literature, but later recategorised as books for youth.
Pohl does not consider himself an author of primarily youth literature.
However, some books were written for children.
Examples are Glittras uppdrag, a fairy tale about an angel that protects a six-year-old boy, and Malins kung Gurra, written for a contest organised by publisher Rabén &amp; Sjögren.

<text>The worst-case execution time (WCET) of a computational task is the maximum length of time the task could take to execute on a specific hardware platform.

== What it is used for ==

Worst case execution time is typically used in reliable real-time systems, where understanding the worst case timing behaviour of software is important for reliability or correct functional behaviour. 

As an example, a computer system that controls the behaviour of an engine in a vehicle might need to respond to inputs within a specific amount of time. One component that makes up the response time is the time spent executing the software – hence if the software worst case execution time can be determined, then the designer of the system can use this with other techniques such as schedulability analysis to ensure that the system responds fast enough.

While WCET is potentially applicable to many real-time systems, in practice an assurance of WCET is mainly used by real-time systems that are related to high reliability or safety. For example, in airborne software some attention to software is required by DO178C section 6.3.4. The increasing use of software in automotive systems is also driving the need to use WCET analysis of software.

In the design of some systems, WCET is often used as an input to schedulability analysis, although a much more common use of WCET in critical systems is to ensure that the pre-allocated timing budgets in a partition-scheduled system such as ARINC 653 are not violated.

== Calculation ==

Since the early days of embedded computing, embedded software developers have either used:
* end-to-end measurements of code, for example performed by setting an I/O pin on the device to high at the start of the task, and to low at the end of the task and using a logic analyzer to measure the longest pulse width, or by measuring within the software itself using the processor clock or instruction count.
* manual static analysis techniques such as counting assembler instructions for each function, loop etc. and then combining them.

Both of these techniques have limitations. End to end measurements place a high burden on software testing to achieve the longest path; counting instructions is only applicable to simple software and hardware. In both cases, a margin for error is often used to account for untested code, hardware performance approximations or mistakes. A margin of 20% is often used, although there is very little justification used for this figure, save for historical confidence (&quot;it worked last time&quot;). 

As software and hardware have increased in complexity, they have driven the need for tool support. Complexity is increasingly becoming an issue in both static analysis and measurements. It is difficult to judge how wide the error margin should be and how well tested the software system is. System safety arguments based on a high-water mark achieved during testing are widely used, but become harder to justify as the software and hardware become less predictable.

In the future, it is likely that a requirement for safety critical systems is that they are analyzed using both static and measurement-based approaches.

=== Considerations ===
The problem of finding WCET by analysis is equivalent to the halting problem and is therefore not solvable in the general. Fortunately, for the kind of systems that engineers typically want to find WCET for, the software is typically well structured, will always terminate and is analyzable.

Most methods for finding a WCET involve approximations (usually a rounding upwards when there are uncertainties) and hence in practice the exact WCET itself is often regarded as unobtainable. Instead, different techniques for finding the WCET produce estimates for the WCET. Those estimates are typically pessimistic, meaning that the estimated WCET is known to be higher than the real WCET (which is usually what is desired). Much work on WCET analysis is on reducing the pessimism in analysis so that the estimated value is low enough to be valuable to the system designer.

WCET analysis usually refers to the execution time of single thread, task or process. However, on modern hardware, especially multi-core, other tasks in the system will impact the WCET of a given task if they share cache, memory lines and other hardware features. Further, task scheduling events such as blocking or to be interruptions should be considered in WCET analysis if they can occur in a particular system. Therefore, it is important to consider the context in which WCET analysis is applied.

=== Automated approaches ===
There are many automated approaches to calculating WCET beyond the manual techniques above. These include:
* analytical techniques to improve test cases to increase confidence in end to end measurements
* static analysis of the software (“static” meaning without executing the software).
* combined approaches, often referred to as “hybrid” analysis, being a combination of measurements and structural analysis

==== Static analysis techniques ====
A static WCET tool attempts to estimate WCET by examining the computer software without executing it directly on the hardware. Static analysis techniques have dominated research in the area since the late 1980s, although in an industrial setting, end-to-end measurements approaches were the standard practice.

Static analysis tools work at a high-level to determine the structure of a program&#x27;s task, working either on a piece of source code or disassembled binary executable. They also work at a low-level, using timing information about the real hardware that the task will execute on, with all its specific features. By combining those two kinds of analysis, the tool attempts to give an upper bound on the time required to execute a given task on a given hardware platform.

At the low-level, static WCET analysis is complicated by the presence of architectural features that improve the average-case performance of the processor: instruction/data caches, branch prediction and instruction pipelines, for example. It is possible, but increasingly difficult, to determine tight WCET bounds if these modern architectural features are taken into account in the timing model used by the analysis.

Certification authorities such as the European Aviation Safety Agency, therefore, rely on model validation suites. 

Static analysis has resulted in good results for simpler hardware, however a possible limitation of static analysis is that the hardware (the CPU in particular) has reached a complexity which is extremely hard to model. In particular, the modelling process can introduce errors from several sources: errors in chip design, lack of documentation, errors in documentation, errors in model creation; all leading to cases where the model predicts a different behavior to that observed on real hardware. Typically, where it is not possible to accurately predict a behavior, a pessimistic result is used, which can lead to the WCET estimate being much larger than anything achieved at run-time. 

Obtaining tight static WCET estimation is particularly difficult on multi-core processors. 

There are a number of commercial and academic tools that implement various forms of static analysis.

==== Measurement and hybrid techniques ====
Measurement-based and hybrid approaches usually try to measure the execution times of short code segments on the real hardware, which are then combined in a higher level analysis. Tools take into account the structure of the software (e.g. loops, branches), to produce an estimate of the WCET of the larger program. The rationale is that it&#x27;s hard to test the longest path in complex software, but it is easier to test the longest path in many smaller components of it. A worst case effect needs only to be seen once during testing for the analysis to be able to combine it with other worst case events in its analysis.

Typically, the small sections of software can be measured automatically using techniques such as instrumentation (adding markers to the software) or with hardware support such as debuggers, and CPU hardware tracing modules. These markers result in a trace of execution, which includes both the path taken through the program and the time at which different points were executed. The trace is then analyzed to determine the maximum time that each part of the program has ever taken to execute, what the maximum observed iteration time of each loop is and whether there are any parts of the software that are untested (Code coverage).

Measurement-based WCET analysis has resulted in good results for both simple and complex hardware, although like static analysis it can suffer excessive pessimism in multi-core situations, where the impact of one core on another is hard to define. A limitation of measurement is that it relies on observing the worst-case effects during testing (although not necessarily at the same time). It can be hard to determine if the worst case effects have necessarily been tested.

There are a number of commercial and academic tools that implement various forms of measurement-based analysis.

== Research ==

The most active research groups are in USA (American Michigan University ), Sweden (Mälardalen, Linköping), Germany (Saarbrücken, Dortmund, Braunschweig), France (Toulouse, Saclay, Rennes), Austria (Vienna), UK (University of York and Rapita Systems Ltd), Italy (Bologna), Spain (Cantabria, Valencia), and Switzerland (Zurich). Recently, the topic of code-level timing analysis has found more attention outside of Europe by research groups in the US (North Carolina, Florida), Canada, Australia, Bangladesh(MBI LAB and RDS), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia-UQU(HISE LAB), Singapore and India (IIT Madras, IISc Bangalore).

=== WCET Tool Challenge ===

The first international WCET Tool Challenge took place during the autumn of 2006. It was organized by the University of Mälardalen and sponsored by the ARTIST2 Network of Excellence on Embedded Systems Design. The aim of the Challenge was to inspect and to compare different approaches in analyzing the worst-case execution time. All available tools and prototypes able to determine safe upper bounds for the WCET of tasks have participated. The final results were presented in November 2006 at the ISoLA 2006 International Symposium in Paphos, Cyprus.

A second Challenge took place in 2008.

<doc id="1029054" wikidata="Q5251043" url="?curid=1029054" title="Def FX">
<text>Def FX was an Australian band founded in 1990 by keyboardist Sean Lowry. Members included Fiona Horne on lead vocals, Blake Gardiner on guitar and Martyn Basha on bass. They released four albums between 1992 and 1996 before disbanding in April 1997. For United States releases and touring, the band used the name Definition FX to avoid confusion with similarly named groups.

Def FX&#x27;s music included elements of electronic dance music, grunge and pop. Basha and Horne resurrected the band for touring in 2012 and 2013.

==History==
Def FX were formed in 1990 in Sydney with the line-up of Martyn Basha on bass guitar, Blake Gardner on lead guitar (both ex-Bezerk), Fiona Horne on lead vocals (ex-Mothers) and Sean Lowry on record player with a padlock on it, sequencers and samples (ex-King Prawn). According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, their &quot;intention from the outset was to mix energetic dance beats with hardcore grungy rock ... equall[ing] a spiralling, trance-inducing blast of electronic dance music.&quot; Larry Van Kriedt was a &quot;hidden fifth member&quot; on saxophone and sequencers (ex-AC/DC, Non Stop Dancers); he &quot;also co-wrote much of the band&#x27;s early material.&quot;

Def FX&#x27;s debut release was a four-track extended play, &quot;Water&quot;, in June 1991 via Phantom Records. It featured the song, &quot;Surfers of the Mind&quot;, which Joanna Palmer of &quot;Tharunka&quot; described as &quot;a violent whirlpool of high-voltage house metal where [Horne] puts her larynx through a militant aerobic workout, while the cool delivery of [Lowry]&#x27;s 21st century gospel raps around her.&quot; The track appeared on national radio station, Triple J&#x27;s listeners&#x27; poll for 1991. They toured Australia, and promoted it with the band&#x27;s first music video. &quot;Water&quot; was produced by Nick Mainsbridge. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 the EP was nominated for Best Independent Release and Producer of the Year.

They followed with a second EP, &quot;Surge&quot;, in November, which included the track, &quot;Under the Blue&quot;. A third EP, &quot;Blink&quot; (June 1992), included the track, &quot;Sex/Game/Sucker&quot;. Gardner was replaced on guitar by Dave Stein late in 1992. Lowry summarised the group&#x27;s attitude to signing with a major label, &quot;It was always important to stay independent long enough to set the parameters of the band, so that anyone who came on board would be clear what the band was like and how it should be marketed.&quot;

Their first album, &quot;Light Speed Collision&quot;, was released in November 1992 in a vinyl-only format via Phantom Records; it appeared in CD format through EMI in the following February. The album included guest vocals by New Zealand pop singer, Margaret Urlich. For its United States version, on RCA/BMG in June 1993, the band used the name, Definition FX, to avoid confusion with a US band, Das EFX. They reordered the tracks and added material from two of their EPs. Lowry explained to Nic Haygarth of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; that &quot;People get the misconception that because we&#x27;re a technology-based band we do a lot of our work and development of songs in the studio, but I suppose what we do there is attempt to transfer the live show to record, and we might put up a very rough mock-up of a song and start playing it.&quot;

The second album, &quot;Baptism&quot;, released in 1993, is a compilation of three Australian-released EPs &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Surge&quot; and &quot;Blink&quot; as well as a 12-inch single, &quot;Surfers of the Mind&quot;. &quot;Baptism&quot; featured the track, &quot;Make Your Stash&quot;, which is apparently so rare that Horne had no idea of its existence when presented it for autographing by a dedicated Def FX fan. The single was rather atypical of Def FX, in that it had no cover art and no B-sides, which had characterised their EPs. The band usually preferred to make each release, be it album or EP, a conceptual work that made full use of the compact disc format that had recently come into commercial prominence. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 &quot;Blink&quot; was nominated for Best Independent Release.

Three more EPs followed &quot;No Time for Nowhere&quot; (March 1993), &quot;Space Time Disco&quot; (June) and &quot;Post Moronic&quot; (September 1994). At the end of 1993 Basha had departed and his duties on bass guitar were taken up by Van Kriedt. &quot;Post Moronic&quot; appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart in the top 50. One of its tracks, &quot;Masses Like Asses&quot;, was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1994.

&quot;Ritual Eternal&quot; (1995), their third album, is more experimental: including tracks without standard guitars and others with Charlie McMahon on didgeridoo (ex-Gondwanaland Project), who also joined Def FX on tour. It was recorded and produced almost entirely by Lowry, following the cancellation of their contract with EMI, and was issued via independent label Cicada Music and distributed by MDS. McFarlane felt the CD was &quot;over-ambitious&quot;. &quot;Ritual Eternal&quot; introduced their new bass guitarist, Peter Tasker, who was forced out of the band months later and replaced by Sean Fonti (ex-Massappeal, Caligula). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 they were nominated for Best Independent Release for their third album.

In October 1995 they issued the EP, &quot;Psychoactive Summer&quot;, which also reached the top 50 on the ARIA Charts. It was followed by their fourth album, &quot;Majick&quot;, in mid-year, which peaked at No. 21 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It provided four singles. The band dissolved in May of that year with the split announced by Horne on ABC-TV&#x27;s Saturday morning youth variety show, &quot;Recovery&quot;.

===Post break up and reunions===
Fiona Horne followed Def FX with musical releases &#x27;Shut Up and Kiss Me&#x27; with Paul McDermott and a solo single &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Out Tonight&quot; (both achieving chart success) before subsequently become a writer, with 15 books including one autobiography, and two oracle decks. Her books explore the subject of Modern Witchcraft. She is an actress, as well as a performer in reality television as both host and contestant; she used to appear on the &quot;Hamish and Andy&quot; radio programme. In March 2007 Horne released her first solo CD, &quot;Witch Web&quot;, based on her spiritual practice.

Sean Lowry completed his Ph.D in 2003 at the University of Sydney. Lowry is now an academic, writer and visual artist. Sean Fonti formed Primary with brother Jamie Fonti also from Caligula and vocalist, Connie Mitchell.

With Horne and Basha as the sole original members, Def FX reunited and embarked on a national tour in May–June 2012, performing in east coast state capitals. Joining the pair were electronic musician Ant Banister (Clan Analogue) on keyboard and vocals and Wiley Cochrane on guitar, as well as an appearance by Jesse Basha (son of bassist Martyn Basha). From October to November 2013 they reformed again to play shows in Adelaide, Melbourne, Newcastle, Sydney and Brisbane. More recently in 2019 they reformed again for a sold out east coast Australia tour, with new Bassist from bands, Sounds Like Winter, True Love Choas, Sian(FTB) Wiliams, In 2023, they reformed for another east coast tour.

Horne formed rock band, SEAWITCH playing guitar, singing and as songwriter in 2020 with former Hellmenn guitarist, Dave Hopkins. SEAWITCH released five videos in two years, one self titled EP and their debut album, &#x27;Well of Spells&#x27; released on the Cheersquad Label on 30 October 2022 debuted at Number 2 on the AIR Record Chart.

<doc id="1029060" wikidata="Q4117900" url="?curid=1029060" title="Aquatic toxicology">
<text>Aquatic toxicology is the study of the effects of manufactured chemicals and other anthropogenic and natural materials and activities on aquatic organisms at various levels of organization, from subcellular through individual organisms to communities and ecosystems. Aquatic toxicology is a multidisciplinary field which integrates toxicology, aquatic ecology and aquatic chemistry.

This field of study includes freshwater, marine water and sediment environments. Common tests include standardized acute and chronic toxicity tests lasting 24–96 hours (acute test) to 7 days or more (chronic tests). These tests measure endpoints such as survival, growth, reproduction, that are measured at each concentration in a gradient, along with a control test. Typically using selected organisms with ecologically relevant sensitivity to toxicants and a well-established literature background. These organisms can be easily acquired or cultured in lab and are easy to handle.

==History==
While basic research in toxicology began in multiple countries in the 1800s, it was not until around the 1930s that the use of acute toxicity testing, especially on fish, was established. Due to the wide use of the organochlorine pesticide DDT [l,l,l-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane] and its linkage to causing fish death, the field of aquatic toxicology grew. At first, studies focused mainly on oysters and mussels, as they could not move away from the toxic environment. The results of these studies eventually led to the implementation of programs that monitor concentrations of aquatic pollutants in oysters and mussels, such as the Mussel Watch program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Over the next two decades, the effects of chemicals and wastes on non-human species became more of a public issue and the era of the &quot;pickle-jar bioassays&quot; began as efforts increased to standardize toxicity testing techniques.

In the United States, the passage of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1947 marked the first comprehensive legislation for the control of water pollution and was followed by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in 1956. In 1962, public and governmental interests were renewed, in large part due to the publication of Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, and three years later the Water Quality Act of 1965 was passed, which directed states to develop water quality standards. Public awareness, as well as scientific and governmental concern, continued to grow throughout the 1970s and by the end of the decade research had expanded to include hazard evaluation and risk analysis. In the subsequent decades, aquatic toxicology has continued to expand and internationalize so that there is now a strong application of toxicity testing for environmental protection.

Aquatic toxicology is continuing to evolve as risk assessment is becoming more practiced in the field. The field is gaining popularity as it has begun to link the effects of pollutants on marine animals to humans who eat fish and other marine life.

==Aquatic toxicity tests==
Aquatic toxicology tests (assays): toxicity tests are used to provide qualitative and quantitative data on adverse (deleterious) effects on aquatic organisms from a . Toxicity tests can be used to assess the potential for damage to an aquatic environment and provide a database that can be used to assess the risk associated within a situation for a specific toxicant. Aquatic toxicology tests can be performed in the field or in the laboratory. Field experiments generally refer to multiple species exposure, but single species can be caged for a set duration, and laboratory experiments generally refer to single species exposure. A dose–response relationship is most commonly used with a sigmoidal curve to quantify the toxic effects at a selected end-point or criteria for effect (i.e. death or other adverse effect to the organism). Concentration is on the x-axis and percent inhibition or response is on the y-axis.

The criteria for effects, or endpoints tested for, can include lethal and sublethal effects (see Toxicological effects).

There are different types of toxicity tests that can be performed on various test species. Different species differ in their susceptibility to chemicals, most likely due to differences in accessibility, metabolic rate, excretion rate, genetic factors, dietary factors, age, sex, health and stress level of the organism. Common standard test species are the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), daphnids (&quot;Daphnia magna&quot;, &quot;D. pulex&quot;, &quot;D. pulicaria&quot;, &quot;Ceriodaphnia dubia&quot;), midge (Chironomus tentans, C. riparius), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatu), zebra fish (&quot;Danio rerio&quot;), mysids (Mysidopsis), oyster (Crassotreas), scud (Hyalalla Azteca), grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and mussels (&quot;Mytilus galloprovincialis&quot;). As defined by ASTM International, these species are routinely selected on the basis of availability, commercial, recreational, and ecological importance, past successful use, and regulatory use.

A variety of acceptable standardized test methods have been published. Some of the more widely accepted agencies to publish methods are: the American Public Health Association, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ASTM International, International Organization for Standardization, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Standardized tests offer the ability to compare results between laboratories.

There are many kinds of toxicity tests widely accepted in the scientific literature and by regulatory agencies. The type of test used depends on many factors: Specific regulatory agency conducting the test, resources available, physical and chemical characteristics of the environment, type of toxicant, test species available, laboratory vs. field testing, end-point selection, and time and resources available to conduct the assays are some of the most common influencing factors on test design.

===Exposure systems===

Exposure systems are four general techniques the controls and test organisms are exposed to the dealing with treated and diluted water or the test solutions.
* Static. A static test exposes the organism in still water. The toxicant is added to the water in order to obtain the correct concentrations to be tested. The control and test organisms are placed in the test solutions and the water is not changed for the entirety of the test.
* Recirculation. A recirculation test exposes the organism to the toxicant in a similar manner as the static test, except that the test solutions are pumped through an apparatus (i.e. filter) to maintain water quality, but not reduce the concentration of the toxicant in the water. The water is circulated through the test chamber continuously, similar to an aerated fish tank. This type of test is expensive and it is unclear whether or not the filter or aerator has an effect on the toxicant.
* Renewal. A renewal test also exposes the organism to the toxicant in a similar manner as the static test because it is in still water. However, in a renewal test the test solution is renewed periodically (constant intervals) by transferring the organism to a fresh test chamber with the same concentration of toxicant.
* Flow-through. A flow-through test exposes the organism to the toxicant with a flow into the test chambers and then out of the test chambers. The once-through flow can either be intermittent or continuous. A stock solution of the correct concentrations of contaminant must be previously prepared. Metering pumps or diluters will control the flow and the volume of the test solution, and the proper proportions of water and contaminant will be mixed.

===Types of tests===
Acute tests are short-term exposure tests (14 days or less) and generally use lethality as an endpoint. In acute exposures, organisms come into contact with higher doses of the toxicant in a single event or in multiple events over a short period of time and usually produce immediate effects, depending on absorption time of the toxicant. These tests are generally conducted on organisms during a specific time period of the organism&#x27;s life cycle, and are considered partial life cycle tests. Acute tests are not valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 10%. However, this control acceptability criterion is dependent upon the species and the duration of the test. Results are reported in EC50, or concentration that will affect fifty percent of the sample size.

Chronic tests are long-term tests (weeks, months years), relative to the test organism&#x27;s life span (&gt;10% of life span), and generally use sub-lethal endpoints. In chronic exposures, organisms come into contact with low, continuous doses of a toxicant. Chronic exposures may induce effects to acute exposure, but can also result in effects that develop slowly. Chronic tests are generally considered full life cycle tests and cover an entire generation time or reproductive life cycle (&quot;egg to egg&quot;). Chronic tests are not considered valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 20%. These results have generally been reported in NOECs (No observed effects level) and LOECs (Lowest observed effects level). However, NOECs and LOECs are becoming less common as endpoints are dependent on the concentration series chosen for the test. These reports are starting to become a topic of debate in the field because of the way it may alter the results of the tests. For example, if the concentration rate of the NOEC is 100, 50, 25, 11.25, 6.25 and the toxicology is reported at 2%, the NOEC would report the concentration as 6.25.

Early life stage tests are considered as subchronic exposures that are less than a complete reproductive life cycle and include exposure during early, sensitive life stages of an organism. These exposures are also called critical life stage, embryo-larval, or egg-fry tests. Early life stage tests are not considered valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 30%.

Short-term sublethal tests are used to evaluate the toxicity of effluents to aquatic organisms. These methods are developed by the EPA, and only focus on the most sensitive life stages. Endpoints for these test include changes in growth, reproduction and survival. NOECs, LOECs and EC50s are reported in these tests.

Bioaccumulation tests are toxicity tests that can be used for hydrophobic chemicals that may accumulated in the fatty tissue of aquatic organisms. Toxicants with low solubilities in water generally can be stored in the fatty tissue due to the high lipid content in this tissue. The storage of these toxicants within the organism may lead to cumulative toxicity. Bioaccumulation tests use bioconcentration factors (BCF) to predict concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants in organisms. The BCF is the ratio of the average concentration of test chemical accumulated in the tissue of the test organism (under steady state conditions) to the average measured concentration in the water.

Freshwater tests and saltwater tests have different standard methods, especially as set by the regulatory agencies. However, these tests generally include a control (negative and/or positive), a geometric dilution series or other appropriate logarithmic dilution series, test chambers and equal numbers of replicates, and a test organism. Exact exposure time and test duration will depend on type of test (acute vs. chronic) and organism type. Temperature, water quality parameters and light will depend on regulator requirements and organism type.

In the US, many wastewater dischargers (e.g., factories, power plants, refineries, mines, municipal sewage treatment plants) are required to conduct periodic whole effluent toxicity (WET) tests under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, pursuant to the Clean Water Act. For facilities discharging to freshwater, effluent is used to perform static-acute multi-concentration toxicity tests with &quot;Ceriodaphnia dubia&quot; (water flea) and &quot;Pimephales promelas&quot; (fathead minnow), among other species. The test organisms are exposed for 48 hours under static conditions with five concentrations of the effluent. The major deviation in the short-term chronic effluent toxicity tests and the acute effluent toxicity tests is that the short-term chronic test lasts for seven days and the acute test lasts for 48 hours. For discharges to marine and estuarine waters, the test species used are sheepshead minnow (&quot;Cyprinodon variegatus&quot;), inland silverside (&quot;Menidia beryllina&quot;), &quot;Americamysis bahia&quot;, and purple sea urchin (&quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot;).

===Sediment tests===
At some point most chemicals originating from both anthropogenic and natural sources accumulate in sediment. For this reason, sediment toxicity can play a major role in the adverse biological effects seen in aquatic organisms, especially those inhabiting benthic habitats. A recommended approach for sediment testing is to apply the sediment quality triad (SQT) which involves simultaneously examining sediment chemistry, toxicity, field alterations, bioaccumulation, and bioavailability assessments that can be used in a laboratory or in the field. Due to the expansion of SQTs, it is now more commonly referred to as &quot;Sediment Assessment Framework.&quot; Collection, handling, and storage of sediment can have an effect on bioavailability and for this reason standard methods have been developed to suit this purpose.

==Toxicological effects==
Toxicity can be broken down into two broad categories of direct and indirect toxicity. Direct toxicity results from a toxicant acting at the site of action in or on the organism. Indirect toxicity occurs with a change in the physical, chemical, or biological environment.

Lethality is most common effect used in toxicology and used as an endpoint for acute toxicity tests. While conducting chronic toxicity tests sublethal effects are endpoints that are looked at. These endpoints include behavioral, physiological, biochemical, and histological changes.

There are a number of effects that occur when an organism is simultaneously exposed to two or more toxicants. These effects include additive effects, synergistic effects, potentiation effects, and antagonistic effects. An additive effect occurs when combined effect is equal to a combination or sum of the individual effects. A synergistic effect occurs when the combination of effects is much greater than the two individual effects added together. Potentiation is an effect that occurs when an individual chemical has no effect is added to a toxicant, and the combination has a greater effect than just the toxicant alone. Finally, an antagonistic effect occurs when a combination of chemicals has less of an effect than the sum of their individual effects.

==Significance in regulatory context==
In the United States, aquatic toxicology plays an important role in the NPDES wastewater permit program. While most wastewater dischargers typically conduct analytical chemistry testing for known pollutants, whole effluent toxicity tests have been standardized and are performed routinely as a tool for evaluating the potential harmful effects of other pollutants not specifically regulated in the discharge permits.

EPA&#x27;s water quality program has published water quality criteria (for individual pollutants) and water quality standards (for water bodies) that were derived from aquatic toxicity tests.

===Sediment quality guidelines===
While sediment quality guidelines are not meant for regulation, they provide a way to rank and compare sediment quality developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA). These sediment quality guidelines are summarized in NOAA&#x27;s Screening Quick Reference Tables (SQuiRT) for many different chemicals.

<text>The G5 is a South African towed howitzer of 155 mm calibre developed in South Africa by Denel Land Systems. The G5 design was based on the Canadian GC-45 155 mm gun which was highly modified to suit southern African conditions.

==Production history==
During the Angolan Bush War, the South African Defence Force found itself at a disadvantage when facing opponents equipped with long-range Soviet Katyusha rocket launchers, which outranged South Africa&#x27;s World War II-era 5.5-inch (140 mm) howitzers by a considerable margin. This led to the issue of a staff requirement for a new artillery system as well as ammunition systems, gun tractor, fire control equipment and a fire control computer system.

From 1963, South Africa had been placed under a United Nations sponsored anti-apartheid arms embargo that led to the creation of the indigenous Armscor military-industrial company to circumvent the arms embargo and to produce weapons systems uniquely tailored to South Africa&#x27;s needs. Armscor responded to the staff requirement and commenced development in 1976. A number of existing designs were evaluated and examples procured in contravention of the arms embargo. As an interim weapon system to act as a stop-gap during the indigenous production process, a number of Soltam 155 mm M-71 gun-howitzers were procured from Israel and entered service as the G4 howitzer.

The Canadian GC-45 was selected as the baseline howitzer from which to commence indigenous development. Armscor procured barrels, 30,000 rounds and design specifications for the GC-45 from Gerald Bull. One of the GC-45 test pieces was mounted on a US 155 mm M59 carriage – and a further six GC-45s had changes made to internal ballistics, barrel construction and carriage and cradle fixtures, to become the prototype models eventually leading to the G5. These GC-45s had been developed by SRC International of Belgium, a joint venture between Gerald Bull&#x27;s Space Research Corporation of Canada and PRB of Belgium. Further changes included the addition of a small APU to allow the gun to dig itself in and move short distances at up to , as well as the addition of an advanced muzzle brake. The G5 became operational in 1983.

Using the normal Extended Range, Full Bore (ERFB) ammunition the normal range is , which can be extended to about using base bleed shells, or using rocket-assisted V-LAP rounds. In 2002 Denel produced the G5-2000 version, with much greater range and accuracy than the earlier 45-calibre version.

The G5 gun has been placed on an OMC 6×6 chassis to produce the fully self-propelled G6 howitzer, and won major export sales in this form from the United Arab Emirates and Oman. In response to a request from India it has also been tested on the back of a TATRA 8×8 wheeled truck, a combination known as the T5-2000. It has also been fitted into a turret, named the T6, that can be placed on any suitable vehicle; it has been fitted on the T-72 tank.

==Operational history==
The G5 howitzer saw action in Angola and Namibia in the South African Border War between 1986 and 1989, where it was in service with the South African Defence Force. The G5 was used operationally for the first time during Operation Alpha Centauri in 1986. The G5 also saw action in the Iran–Iraq War between 1980 and 1988, where it was used by Iraq.

<text>Termoli (Molisano: &quot;Térmëlë&quot;) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) on the south Adriatic coast of Italy, in the province of Campobasso, region of Molise. It has a population of around 32,000, having expanded quickly after World War II, and it is a local resort town known for its beaches and old fortifications. Once it was known only as a fishing port, but in the new millennium it is a favourite resort for Italian families. Termoli contains the only port of the Molise region. There is also a strong competition (especially in the world of sport) with the Campobasso province, in fact some of the &quot;termolesi&quot; (the name of the people that lives in Termoli) like to say that Termoli is province-less (&quot;Termoli senza provincia&quot;).

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Termoli is located in centre-south of Italy, on the Adriatic Coast of Molise Region.
The original settlement developed on the promontory where now there&#x27;s the ancient village, featured by old white and colorful fisherman houses, narrow streets, Trabucchi on the sea, the Romanesque Cathedral (&quot;Duomo&quot;), Castello Svevo (&quot;Frederick&#x27;s Castle of 1200&quot;) and high walls.

The centre of the city is developed on the nearby ancient village, here you can find many avenues and streets full of life, especially in summer. On the seafront there are several restaurants, hotels and beaches; out of suburbs there are countrysides cultivated with olive trees and wine.

=== Climate ===
Termoli has a Mediterranean climate (&quot;CSa&quot;) tending to semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;) according to Köppen climate classification because precipitation is about 350 mm annual with the autumn as wettest season and a minimum in summer (less 20 mm in July and August).

Winters are mild but the city may experience windy days because of Maestrale (&quot;Mistral&quot;) which occasionally can bring snow, even if it is a rare phenomenon that occurs in the whole south Italy. Daily mean is about 10 °C (50 °F) with a maximum that can reach from 12 °C (54 °F) to 15 °C (59 °F), above all in days with winds from south and a minimum of 7 °C (46 °F).

Summers are long (they lasts 4 months) and quite hot but thanks to winds they are tolerable with an average high that can generally reach 29/30 °C (85/86 °F); in latest years, as a result of African anticyclone, temperatures were very high reaching 35/40 °C (95/104 °F) also due to southern hot winds from Africa.

In July and August nights are considered &quot;tropicals&quot; because the average low is about 24 °C. Rains are rare but sometimes there can be thunderstorms which doesn&#x27;t contribute well to the dry situation of summer. 

==History==

Human settlements existed in Termoli since pre-historical times, as showed by the presence of ancient necropolis in contrada Porticone and Difesa Grande, as well as from reconnaissance attestations of ville owned by Romans patricians that had their villa near the Molisan coast.

The first documentation of today&#x27;s city dates to the presence of the ancestor of the current cathedral, documented in the 10th century. Termoli was a Lombard county until the arrival of the Normans, under which flourished and expanded. Later devastations meant a period of decay which lasted until around 1770, when the local nobles were permitted by the Kings of Naples to build new edifices along the coast and in direction of the countryside.

During World War II Termoli became the centre of one of the largest tank battles of the Italian campaign over the period 2 to 6 October, 1943. On the night of 2/3 October, during Operation Devon, British Commandos of the 2nd Special Service Brigade, which comprised No. 3 (Army) Commando, 40 (Royal Marine) Commando and the Special Raiding Squadron landed by sea then cleared the town of most of its German defenders. During the first day these forces set up road blocks around the town and were joined by British infantry advancing across the Biferno river to the south-east. They were unaware that the 16th Panzer Division was on its way to create a new defensive line. On 4 October British reinforcements arrived by sea and land, but tanks were unable to cross the river until engineers completed a bridge for heavy traffic. On 5 October the panzers attacked, pushing much of the British line back in disarray. At the end of the day they were only a short distance from the town. With the arrival of further reinforcements at the port, the engineers were able to complete the bridge allowing tanks to cross. On 6 October the Germans renewed their attack but it soon stalled and the British, with Canadian tanks from the Three Rivers Regiment (12e Régiment blindé du Canada) in support, counter-attacked. They were successful and by 7 October the Germans were pulling back to their next line of defence.

Termoli is rapidly becoming one of the most important centres in the Molise. The latter region suffered from depopulation in the years after World War II and there has been a migration from the internal hill towns to the coastal resort. Its status as the pre-eminent resort site is now being challenged by Campomarino, about southward.

==Main sights==

===Historical old town===

The old town has been well restored. It is a genuine walled community jutting out into the sea. Many of the houses have been re-built and painted in a range of pastel colours. In a central square there is the cathedral (12th-13th century), dedicated to St. Mary of the Purification: it is a noteworthy example of Apulian Romanesque architecture which houses the relics of the city&#x27;s two patron saints, Bassus of Lucera (&quot;San Basso&quot;) and Timothy. The upper part of the façade was destroyed by an earthquake in 1456, and also suffered from the Turkish sack of the city in 1566. The Baroque additions were eliminated in the restoration of 1930–69, returning the edifice to its original appearance. Part of a pre-existing basilica, built in the 11th century (over the original, smaller cathedral called &quot;Ecclesia Sanctae Mater&quot;) but soon destroyed, has been found under the edifice.

The castle is the most pre-eminent structure in Termoli. Erected by count Robert I of Loritello during the Norman domination (11th century), it was largely renovated during the rule of Frederick II (1240), after the damage created by an attack of the Venetian fleet. The castle was part of a wider fortification system, including a wall surrounding the entire city, of which only a tower can still be seen.

===Seaside resort===

Termoli&#x27;s resorts are renowned for the quality of their beaches and the relative purity of their waters.Very few non-Italians come to stay in this area. Increasingly, the tourists to Molise are from the Naples and Apulia regions, to the south of Molise. Recently palm trees have been planted along the seaside promenade, and in the summer the many restaurants are crowded with visitors from surrounding communities.

Within a radius of about from Termoli travellers can find the hilltowns of Larino, Casacalenda, Montorio, and Montelongo, which preserve a rural way of life which is disappearing in other, more developed, parts of Italy.

===Port and fishing===
Termoli continues to be a port and a fishing town. A distinguishing feature of the old town are the &quot;trabucchi&quot;, wooden structures for fishing without the use of boats.

Ferries run from Termoli to the Tremiti Islands archipelago in the Adriatic Sea.
==Culture==

Termoli hosts several cultural events.

The Kimera Film Festival was established in 2003. Starting from 2008, the public selection of the short movies is held in Termoli, from February to April of every year.

Termoli was also the location of the &quot;Come Inside&quot; video by Jamaican dancehall artist Spice.

Just like the neighboring settlements, Termoli has a Abrëshe population.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Termoli is twinned with:

* Chorzów, Poland
* Pompano Beach, Florida

<text>Bozorg Alavi (; February 2, 1904 – February 18, 1997) was an influential Iranian writer, novelist, and political intellectual. He was a founding member of the communist Tudeh Party of Iran in the 1940s andfollowing the 1953 coup against Premier Mohammad Mossadeghspent the rest of his life in exile in East Germany, first during the Pahlavi regime, then returning to Germany once more following the 1979 revolution. &quot;Cheshm&#x27;hā&#x27;yash&quot; (Her Eyes), which was published in Iran in 1952 and was subsequently banned, is considered his finest novel. Alavi was also a very close friend of Iran&#x27;s famous writer Sadegh Hedayat; these two created a literary group
when they were residing in Paris called &quot;sab&#x27;e group&quot;. Although &quot;Her Eyes&quot; is considered his masterpiece, Alavi also wrote many other books, such as the novel &quot;Chamedan&quot; (suitcase) which was written under the influence of Freudian psychology. His other novels &quot;&quot;Mirza&quot;,&quot; &quot;Fifty Three Persons&quot; and &quot;Gilemard&quot; are mentioned in Iranian high-school textbooks. He did return to Tehran after the revolution but did not stay too long and decided to head back to Germany. Bozorg Alavi&#x27;s contribution to Iranian Literature is profound due to the modernization movement in which he was a key member.

==Biography==
Bozorg Alavi (born Seyyed Mojtaba Alavi) was born in Tehran, Iran. He was the third of six children. His father, Seyyed Abol Hassan Alavi, took part in the 1906 Constitutional Revolution and later published (with Hasan Taqizadeh) the progressive newsletter Kaveh (Kaweh) in Germany. His paternal grandfather was Seyyed Mohammad Sarraf, a wealthy banker and merchant, who was a leading constitutionalist and member of the first Majles. Sarraf was a younger brother of Haj Seyyed Javad Khazaneh, treasurer of Nasser ed-Din Shah Qajar and later Mozaffar ed-Din Shah Qajar. Bozorg Alavi derived his nickname &#x27;Bozorg&#x27; from being named after his great-grandfather -his Agha Bozorg- Agha Seyyed Mojtaba Ghannad, sugar merchant, confectioner and shipowner, who died in the year Bozorg was born,

Bozorg Alavi had his primary schooling in Tehran. In 1922 he was sent to Berlin along with his older brother Morteza Alavi, to study. Upon his return to Iran in 1927, he first taught German in Shiraz and later in Tehran. During these years he met and befriended Sadegh Hedayat. Around this time he became active in the meetings held by Taqi Arani, and they launched a theoretical Marxist magazine, &quot;Donya&quot;. Alavi was one of the famous 53 persons who were jailed in 1937 under the regime of Reza Shah for communist activities. Alavi himself claimed that he was not involved politically at the time and simply was in a group of literati, who among other things read communist writings. He was given a 7-year sentence, but was released after 4 years in 1941 after a general amnesty following the Allied control of Iran. Upon his release he published his &quot;Scrap Papers of Prison&quot; and &quot;Fifty Three Persons,&quot; and continued his political activities, becoming a founding member of the communist Tudeh Party of Iran and serving as editor of its publication &quot;Mardom&quot; (People). Alavi was in Germany when the 1953 Coup d&#x27;état overthrew the government of Premier Mossadegh and resulted in massive arrests and imprisonment. Alavi stayed in exile in East Berlin, teaching at Humboldt University, until the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty and the emergence of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

In spring of 1979 he returned briefly to Iran after 25 years in exile and was warmly received by the Iranian Writers Association, including such writers/poets as Ahmad Shamlou, Mahmoud Dolatābādi, Siāvash Kasrā&#x27;ie and others. He returned to Iran a year later in 1980 for another short visit and was dismayed by the repressive turn of the revolution. He continued to live and work in Berlin, visiting Iran for the last time in 1993. He died in Berlin in 1997.

In 1936 he had married Margarita (Gita) Scheineson from Brussels, who later was a source of inspiration for his novel &quot;Chashm&#x27;hā&#x27;yash&quot;. Before his exile, he married his cousin Fatameh Alavi (daughter of Seyyed Abolfath Fadai Alavi, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance, and Merafagh Tabatabai) and had a son, Mani. In 1956, he married Gertrud Paarszh in Germany who stayed with him until his death.

<text>The Surf Punks were a pop punk band formed in 1976 by Malibu residents Dennis Dragon (1947-2017) and Drew Steele (d. October 2021). (Dragon was the son of symphony conductor Carmen Dragon, the brother of Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s Daryl Dragon, and he was previously the drummer of the Byrds and the Beach Boys. Steele&#x27;s stepfather was Gavin MacLeod of McHale&#x27;s Navy, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Love Boat fame.) Dragon recruited the additional talents of Malibu residents Tony Creed AKA the &quot;Hulk&quot;, for lead guitar and blues harp, fellow bodysurfer/frisbeeist John Hunt on the bass, and South Bay resident John Heussenstamm for lead guitar. This was the original core group, produced and engineered by Dragon in his garage studio across the street from Zuma Beach, his favorite body surfing spot. Mark Miller joined them on &quot;Locals Only.&quot; Jeff &quot;Ray Ban&quot; Eyrich joined the Surf Punks on bass when John Hunt left the group.

Scott Goddard (1952–2006) later joined as lead vocalist on a few songs.
==Background==
Record producer and then Malibu resident Denny Cordell saw merit in the group and released their first recordings on a single, &quot;My Beach&quot; b/w &quot;My Wave&quot;, in Australia on Shelter Records. Their subsequent first album, an independent release on their own label, Day Glo Records, garnered them enough airplay on the then fledgling L.A. alternative radio station KROQ-FM to lead to a re-release of the album on Epic Records in 1980, and the release of two further albums, &quot;Locals Only&quot; and &quot;Oh No, Not Them Again&quot; on Enigma Records, with Mark Miller, keyboard player Jerry Weber and lifeguard/guitarist Andy Jackson.

Dragon and Hulk also provided the theme song to KLOS disc jockey Frazer Smith&#x27;s signature show bumper, &quot;Cool Patrol&quot;. Heavy rotation on KROQ-FM was largely responsible for the band selling out their first live performance ever at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. The Surf Punks were road managed from 1980 to 1983 by Michael Parenti (the artist, not the political writer), who also provided many of the T-shirt designs for the band. At one time, rock legend Johnny Rivers showed interest in the band by co-producing with Dragon a single titled &quot;Surfs Up Medley&quot;, released on his own Soul City label. TV producer Chris Bearde also managed the band for a short time and tried with movie producer Brian Grazer and Rivers to procure a Hollywood movie deal for the band.

The live shows of the Surf Punks, in the heyday of the punk explosion in L.A., were full of wild abandon. High points of the show were &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get a Tan&quot; and &quot;Big Top&quot;.

The lyrics of the band centered primarily on the in-group/out-group experiences of &quot;locals&quot; (surfers living on the beach in Malibu) and &quot;vals&quot; (commuters from the San Fernando Valley to the private and public beaches of the exclusive Malibu Beach community). Never truly &quot;punk&quot; in the traditional sense of the word, the Surf Punks were sort of a &quot;Beach Boys of the punk world,&quot; offering their take on the &quot;turf wars&quot; over the southern California beaches and its waves.

The band made at least five music videos: &quot;My Beach&quot;, &quot;Big Top&quot;, &quot;Welcome to California&quot;, &quot;Shark Attack&quot; and another for their cover of &quot;Come on-a My House&quot;, which was originally a hit for Rosemary Clooney. They also appeared in the 1988 film &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot;.

<doc id="1029074" wikidata="Q4447630" url="?curid=1029074" title="Desire realm">
<text>The desire realm (Sanskrit: कामधातु, &quot;kāmadhātu&quot;) is one of the trailokya or three realms (Sanskrit: धातु, &quot;dhātu&quot;, Tibetan: &quot;khams&quot;) in Buddhist cosmology into which a being caught in &quot;&quot; may be reborn. The other two are the Form Realm (Sanskrit: &quot;rūpadhātu&quot;) and the Formless Realm (&quot;ārūpadhātu&quot;).

Within the desire realm are either five or six domains (Sanskrit: &quot;gati&quot;, also sometimes translated as &quot;realm&quot;). In Tibetan Buddhism, there are six domains (), and in Theravada Buddhism there are only five, because the domain of the Asuras is not regarded as separate from that of the Nāgas. The concept of these five realms is also to be found in Taoism and Jainism.

The &quot;Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot; in Mahayana Buddhism regarded the 10 kinds of Xian as separate immortal realms between the deva and human realms.&lt;ref name=&quot;f_95 辨《楞严经》十种仙] &lt;/ref&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The six domains of the desire realm are also known as the &quot;six paths of suffering&quot;, the &quot;six planes&quot;, and the &quot;six lower realms&quot;. In schools of thought that use the ten realms system, these six domains are often contrasted negatively with the &quot;four higher realms&quot; of Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva and full Buddha, which are considered to be the spiritual goals of the different Buddhist traditions.

A being&#x27;s karma (previous actions and thoughts) determines which of the six domains it will be reborn into. A sentient being may also ascend to one of the higher realms beyond the six domains of the desire realm by practicing various types of meditation, specifically the Eight Dhyānas.

The 8th century Buddhist monument Borobudur in Central Java incorporated the trailokya into the architectural design with the plan of mandala that took the form of a stepped stone pyramid crowned with stupas.

==The Six Domains==
The six domains of the desire realm are as follows:

*the deity (Sanskrit, Pali: &quot;deva&quot;) domain
*the jealous god / titan (S., P.: &quot;asura&quot;) domain
*the human (S. &quot;manuṣya,&quot; P. &quot;manussa&quot;) domain
*the animal (S. &quot;tiryagyoni,&quot; P. &quot;tiracchānayoni&quot;) domain
*the hungry ghost (S. &quot;preta,&quot; P. &quot;petta&quot;) domain
*the hell (S: &quot;naraka,&quot; P. &quot;niraya&quot;) domain

===Deva Domain===

The &quot;Deva domain&quot; (also known as the &quot;heavenly domain&quot; or &quot;Blissful State&quot;) is the domain of bliss. The disadvantage of this domain is that things are so very comfortable there, that these beings completely neglect to work towards enlightenment. Instead they gradually use up the good karma they had previously accumulated, and so they subsequently fall to a lower rebirth.

The Deva domain is sometimes also referred to as the &quot;gods&#x27; domain&quot;, because of its inhabitants&#x27; power compared to humans. However, they are not immortal, only long-lived, and are still subject to karma and the saṃsāra.

===Asura Domain===

The &quot;Asura domain&quot; (also known as &quot;the Jealous God domain&quot;) is the domain of the Asuras (demigods). They are here because of actions in past lives based on egotistic jealousy, envy, insincerity, struggle, combat or rationalization of the world. They may be here because in human form they had good intentions but committed bad actions such as harming others. The Asuras of some other domains, however, are fully malevolent (such as the corruptor Mara) and can be more closely related to the translation of demon that is sometimes ascribed to them. These evil Asuras can be alternatively referred to as Rakshasas.

The Asuras are said to experience a much more pleasurable life than humans, but they are plagued by envy for the Devas, whom they can see just as animals can see humans.

===Manussa Domain===

The &quot; domain&quot; (also known as the &quot;Human domain&quot;) is based on passion, desire, doubt, and pride.

Buddhists see this domain as the realm of human existence. Although it may not be the most pleasurable domain to live in, a human rebirth is in fact considered to be by far the most advantageous of all possible rebirths in samsara, because a human rebirth is the only samsaric domain from which one can directly attain Bodhi (enlightenment), either in the present rebirth (for Buddhas and Arhats) or in a future rebirth in a Deva domain (for Anagamis). This is because of the unique possibilities that a human rebirth offers: beings in higher domains just choose to enjoy the pleasures of their realms and neglect working towards enlightenment, while beings in lower domains are too busy trying to avoid the suffering and pain of their worlds to give a second thought to liberation. Humans have just the right balance: enough suffering to motivate them to achieve liberation, but not too much that every moment of their lives is consumed by it.

A human rebirth is considered to have tremendous potential when used correctly, however in most cases humans waste their lifetimes in materialistic pursuits rather than working towards enlightenment, and so end up reinforcing their unhelpful emotions, thoughts, and actions, rather than letting go of them. Because of this, it is almost always the case that one descends to a lower domain of rebirth after a human life, rather than immediately going on to another human birth, or going up to a higher domain.

In the lower domains, such as the animal domain, it is a very slow and difficult process to accumulate enough merit to achieve a human rebirth once again, so it may be countless lifetimes before one has another chance.

===Tiryagyoni Domain===

The &quot;Tiryagyoni domain&quot; (alternately spelled &quot;Tiryag-yoni&quot; or &quot;tiracchānayoni&quot;) (also known as the &quot;Animal domain&quot;) is based on strong mental states of stupidity and prejudice cultivated in a previous life or lives.

Buddhists believe that this domain is the domain of existence of the nonhuman animals on the Earth. Although humans and animals live in separate domains of existence, they can still see each other because their domains are so close to each other in the vertical cosmology, just as the Devas and Asuras can see each other despite being in separate domains.

===Preta Domain===

The &quot;Preta domain&quot; (also known as the &quot;Hungry Ghost domain&quot;) is a rebirth based on strong possessiveness and desire which were cultivated in a previous life or lives.

The sentient beings in this domain are known as &quot;hungry ghosts&quot;. They are constantly extremely hungry and thirsty, but they cannot satisfy these needs. In Tibetan versions of the Bhavacakra these beings are drawn with narrow necks and large bellies. This represents the fact that their desires torment them, but they are completely unable to satisfy themselves.

===Naraka Domain===

The &quot;Naraka domain&quot; (also known as the &quot;Niraya domain&quot; or the &quot;Hell domain&quot;) is a rebirth based on strong states of hatred cultivated in a previous life or lives. The sentient beings in Naraka stay there until their negative karma is spent, at which point they are reborn into another domain.

==The Wheel of life==

The Bhavachakra or &quot;Wheel of Life&quot; is a popular teaching tool often used in the Indo-Tibetan tradition. It is a kind of diagram which portrays these realms and the mechanism that causes these samsaric rebirths. In this depiction, the realm of the Devas is shown at the top, followed clockwise by the realms of the Asuras, the Animals, Naraka, the Pretas, and the Humans. Close examination will show that the Buddha is shown as being present in every one of these realms.

==Characteristics==
In Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, there are some sayings reflecting a tradition that the manner of a sentient being&#x27;s death indicates the world in which it will be reborn. A common one is that in the &quot;Verses on the Structure of the Eight Consciousnesses&quot; (八識規矩補註), which reads: &quot;in those to be reborn as saints the last part to retain bodily heat is the top of the head, in those to be reborn devas it is the eyes, while in the case of the human realm it is the heart, that of the hungry ghosts, the belly, that of animals, the knee caps, and lastly, in that of the hell realm, the soles of the feet.&quot; The Tibetan Buddhist text Bardo Thodol describes further on the experiences proper to these realms.

==In yogic practice==
Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche and Chögyal Namkai Norbu Rinpoche have published literature teaching a &quot;Practice of the Six Lokas&quot; designed to &quot;purify the karmic traces that lead to rebirth in the different realms,&quot; wherein the six lokas are also cognate with the principal six chakra system of Vajrayana.

<doc id="1029087" wikidata="Q3746401" url="?curid=1029087" title="Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars">
<text>Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars is a 1938 Universal Pictures 15–chapter science-fiction movie serial based on the syndicated newspaper comic strip &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. It is the second of the three Flash Gordon serials made by Universal between 1936 and 1940. The main cast from the first serial reprise their roles: Buster Crabbe as Flash Gordon, Jean Rogers as Dale Arden, Frank Shannon as Dr. Alexis Zarkov, Charles B. Middleton as Ming the Merciless, and Richard Alexander as Prince Barin. Also in the principal cast are Beatrice Roberts as Queen Azura, Donald Kerr as Happy Hapgood, Montague Shaw as the Clay King, and Wheeler Oakman as Ming&#x27;s chief henchman. The serial was followed by &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; (1940).

==Plot==
When a mysterious beam of light starts disrupting and destroying the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe), Dr. Zarkov (Frank Shannon), and Dale Arden (Jean Rogers) - accidentally accompanied by wisecracking reporter Happy Hapgood (Donald Kerr) - swing into action in Zarkov&#x27;s rocketship, believing that it could be coming from the planet Mongo. Once in space, they discover that the ray originates from Mars.

Journeying to the fourth planet, they discover their old enemy from Mongo, Ming the Merciless (Charles B. Middleton), is alive and allied with Azura (Beatrice Roberts), the Witch Queen of Mars. From there, under her protection, he is operating a Nitron ray destroying Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Azura can transmute people into living clay, condemned to live and die in darkened caves, and she is hated and feared by most of the population. Conversely, the Clay People, led by their King (Montague Shaw), know how to eliminate Azura&#x27;s power, but lack the means of escaping the caves to which their ruined bodies restrict them.

Gordon and his party seem to hold the answer to their problem, except that the Clay People do not trust them at first, and end up holding Dale Arden hostage. Ultimately, the Earth visitors and the Clay People become allies in the tandem quest to defeat Azura and stop Ming from destroying the Earth. Flash, Dale, Zarkov, and Hapgood do battle against Azura&#x27;s magic and her Martian space force, Ming&#x27;s super-scientific weaponry, the treacherous Forest People, and other dangers on the Red Planet. Finally, they win by the classic strategy of divide-and-conquer, showing Azura that Ming has been plotting behind her back to take power from her.

Azura&#x27;s alliance with Ming is broken, at the cost of the Queen&#x27;s own life, but the Clay People are freed from their curse. The evil emperor of Mongo, his Nitron ray destroyed and his escape cut off on all sides by the now hostile Martian forces, is seemingly vanquished by the accidental result of his own machinations and treachery.

==Cast==
* Buster Crabbe as Flash Gordon
* Jean Rogers as Dale Arden
* Charles B. Middleton as Ming the Merciless
* Frank Shannon as Dr. Alexis Zarkov
* Beatrice Roberts as Queen Azura
* Donald Kerr as Happy Hapgood
* Richard Alexander as Prince Barin
* C. Montague Shaw as Clay King
* Wheeler Oakman as Tarnak
* Kenne Duncan as Airdrome captain
* Warner Richmond as Zandar

Cast notes:
* Charles Middleton&#x27;s portrayal of Ming is devilish in this serial, as opposed his Fu Manchu-like performance in the first serial.

==Production==
This serial, the first sequel to the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serial, was based on the 1936 &quot;Big Little Book&quot; adaptation of the strip &quot;Flash Gordon and the Witch Queen of Mongo&quot;. According to Harmon and Glut, the location was changed to Mars to capitalize on Orson Welles&#x27; famous &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast. According to Stedman, this serial preceded that broadcast, which made Universal hastily release a feature version of the serial as &quot;Mars Attacks the World&quot; to capitalize on the publicity. The film was a box-office success.

&quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot; was less expensive to make than the first Flash Gordon serial.

===&quot;Mars Attacks the World&quot;===
Universal Pictures also prepared a feature-length version of this serial, which was already ready for release in October 1938 when Orson Welles astounded the country with his &quot;Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; radio production of H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Universal then quickly had the feature&#x27;s title changed to &quot;Mars Attacks the World&quot;, and a week after the Welles broadcast, opened it at a Broadway theater as a major premiere event. The original title for this feature had been &quot;Rocket Ship&quot;, which was subsequently used for reissues of the first Flash Gordon serial&#x27;s feature version, which had been originally released under its source serial&#x27;s title in 1936 in the United Kingdom.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Time&quot; in 1938 declared the serial to be &quot;a Grade A cinemedition of the famed King Features strip&quot;.

==Television broadcasting==
In the 1950s, the three serials were broadcast on American television. To avoid confusion with a made-for-TV Flash Gordon series airing at the same time, they were retitled, becoming respectively &quot;Space Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Space Soldiers&#x27; Trip to Mars&quot;, and &quot;Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe&quot;. They were shown by PBS U.S. stations, and by the BBC in the United Kingdom – where they aired as &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serials, under their original titles.

<doc id="1029098" wikidata="Q7675950" url="?curid=1029098" title="Tadhg">
<text>Tadhg, also Taḋg ( , ), commonly anglicized as &quot;Taig&quot; or &quot;Teague&quot;, is an Irish masculine name that was very common when the Goidelic languages predominated, to the extent that it is a synecdoche for Irish-speaking man. The name signifies &quot;poet&quot; or &quot;philosopher&quot;. This was also the name of many Gaelic Irish kings from the 10th to the 16th centuries, particularly in Connacht and Munster. Tadhg is most common in southwest Ireland, particularly in County Cork and County Kerry. The name has had a surge in popularity in the early 21st century; As of 2000 it was the 92nd most common name for baby boys in Ireland, according to the Central Statistics Office, rising to 69th by 2005. By 2022, it had risen to the 7th most common name for newly registered male births. 

== Etymology ==
The commonly accepted meaning of Tadhg is &quot;poet&quot; or &quot;storyteller&quot;. The ultimate derivation is from the Celtic , who were poets in early Celtic society. In any case, the name is widely attested in Gaulish and early British names.

When the whole of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, many Irish names and place-names were given English meanings. Due to similarity in sound, Tadhg is often listed as an Irish equivalent of the English-language names Timothy (Tim) or Thaddeus.

The name is also spelled &quot;Taḋg&quot; in Gaelic type with an overdot over the &quot;d&quot; to indicate it is lenited; the &quot;dh&quot; serves a similar purpose in the modern spelling. Tadhg has been anglicized as &quot;Taihg&quot;, &quot;Tighe&quot; and &quot;Teague&quot;. Alternative spellings include &quot;Tadgh&quot; and &quot;Tadg&quot;.

==Synecdoche==
Tadhg is also a metonym and was once so common as an Irish name that it became synonymous with the typical Irishman in the same way that &quot;Paddy&quot; or &quot;Mick&quot; might be today. Hence, Irish phrases such as &#x27; (lit: Tadhg of the market) or &#x27; (lit: Tadhg of the street) are similar to the English language expression &quot;average Joe&quot; or &quot;the man on the street&quot;
The anglicisation &quot;Taig&quot; (and formerly &quot;Teague&quot;) has been used in English since the seventeenth century to refer to Irishmen. The Irish-language name is used defiantly in a Jacobite poem written in the 1690s:

Taig in the Troubles in Northern Ireland was used as an abusive and pejorative term by Protestant loyalists to refer to Catholic nationalists.

<doc id="1029100" wikidata="Q315380" url="?curid=1029100" title="Irwin Shaw">
<text>Irwin Shaw (February 27, 1913 – May 16, 1984) was an American playwright, screenwriter, novelist, and short-story author whose written works have sold more than 14 million copies. He is best known for two of his novels: &quot;The Young Lions&quot; (1948), about the fate of three soldiers during World War II, which was made into a film of the same name starring Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, and &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1970), about the fate of two brothers and a sister in the post-World War II decades, which in 1976 was made into a popular miniseries starring Peter Strauss, Nick Nolte, and Susan Blakely.

== Personal life ==

Shaw was born Irwin Gilbert Shamforoff in the South Bronx, New York City, to Jewish immigrants from Nizhyn, Ukraine His parents were Rose and Will. His younger brother, David Shaw, became a noted Hollywood producer and writer. Shortly after Irwin&#x27;s birth, the Shamforoffs moved to Brooklyn. Irwin changed his surname upon entering college. He spent most of his youth in Brooklyn, where he graduated from Brooklyn College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1934.

He began screenwriting in 1935 at age 21. In 1939 he married actress and producer Marian Edwards, daughter of silent film actor Snitz Edwards. The couple divorced in 1967, remarrying two years before Irwin&#x27;s death in 1984.

During World War II, he was approached by William Wyler to join his film unit. Unable to be commissioned as an officer due to his age and 1-A draft status, Shaw decided to enter the Regular Army. Later, the Army, noting his background, reassigned him to the Signal Corps with George Stevens&#x27; film unit. He was one of four writers attached to Stevens&#x27; command, in which he became a warrant officer. After the war, he returned to his career as a writer.

Shaw died in Davos, Switzerland on May 16, 1984, at age 71, after undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.

== Career ==

=== Drama ===
In the 1930s, Shaw wrote scripts for several radio shows, including &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;The Gumps&quot; and &quot;Studio One&quot;. He recaptured this period of his life in his short story &quot;Main Currents of American Thought,&quot; about a hack radio writer grinding out one script after another while calculating the number of words equal to the rent money:

Shaw&#x27;s first play, &quot;Bury the Dead&quot; (1936) was an expressionist drama about a group of soldiers killed in a battle who refuse to be buried. His play &quot;Quiet City&quot;, directed by Elia Kazan and with incidental music by Aaron Copland, closed after two Sunday performances.

During the 1940s, Shaw wrote for a number of films, including &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (a comedy about civil liberties), &quot;The Commandos Strike at Dawn&quot; (based on a C.S. Forester story about commandos in occupied Norway) and &quot;Easy Living&quot; (about a football player unable to enter the game due to a medical condition). Shaw married Marian Edwards (daughter of well-known screen actor Snitz Edwards). They had one son, Adam Shaw, born in 1950, himself a writer of magazine articles and non-fiction.

Shaw summered at the Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, which became the 1936 summer home of the Group Theatre (New York), whose roster included Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, Harry Morgan, John Garfield, Frances Farmer, Will Geer, Clifford Odets and Lee J. Cobb.

=== Novels and miniseries ===
&quot;The Young Lions&quot;, Shaw&#x27;s first novel, was published in 1948. Based on his experiences in Europe during the war, the novel was very successful and was adapted into a 1958 film. Shaw was not happy with the film, feeling it soft-pedaled some of the serious issues from his book, but it did well at the box office.

In 1950 Shaw published &quot;Report on Israel&quot;, a journalistic book dealing with the situation in the state around the time of its founding with photographs by Robert Capa&quot;.&quot;

Shaw&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Troubled Air&quot;, chronicling the rise of McCarthyism, was published in 1951. He was among those who signed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo convictions for contempt of Congress, resulting from hearings by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Accused of being a communist by the Red Channels publication, Shaw was placed on the Hollywood blacklist by the movie studio bosses. In 1951 he left the United States and went to Europe, where he lived for 25 years, mostly in Paris and Switzerland. He later claimed that the blacklist &quot;only glancingly bruised&quot; his career. During the 1950s he wrote several more screenplays, including &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; (based on Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play) and &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; (about a tramp boat in the Caribbean).

While living in Europe, Shaw wrote more bestselling books, notably &quot;Lucy Crown&quot; (1956), &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; (1960), &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1970) (for which he would later write a less successful sequel entitled &quot;Beggarman, Thief&quot;) and &quot;Evening in Byzantium&quot; (made into a 1978 TV movie).

&quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; was adapted into a highly successful ABC television miniseries with six 2-hour episodes shown for February 1 to March 15, 1976. The series ranked third in the seasonal Nielsens and garnered twenty-three Emmy nominations. A further adaptation, which Shaw had very little to do with, &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man--Book II&quot; was aired from September 21, 1976, to March 8, 1977. This was not as successful as the first. There was a third sequel &quot;Beggar Man, Thief&quot; in 1978, which belatedly included the Jordache&#x27;s sister Gretchen who had been a prominent character in the original book.

His novel &quot;The Top of the Hill&quot; (1979) was made into a TV movie about the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid in 1980, starring Wayne Rogers, Adrienne Barbeau, and Sonny Bono.

His last two novels were &quot;Bread Upon the Waters&quot; (1981), a realist novel dealing with the socioeconomic conditions of 20th century New York, and &quot;Acceptable Losses&quot; (1982).

=== Short stories ===

Shaw was highly regarded as a short story author, contributing to &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and other magazines; and 63 of his best stories were collected in &quot;Short Stories: Five Decades&quot; (Delacorte, 1978), reprinted in 2000 as a 784-page University of Chicago Press paperback. Among his noted short stories are: &quot;Sailor Off The Bremen&quot;, &quot;The Eighty-Yard Run&quot;, and &quot;Tip On A Dead Jockey&quot;. Three of his stories (&quot;The Girls in Their Summer Dresses&quot;, &quot;The Monument&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Married a French Wife&quot;) were dramatized for the PBS series &quot;Great Performances&quot;. Telecast on June 1, 1981. This production was released on DVD in 2002 by Kultur Video.

=== Awards ===
During his lifetime Shaw won a number of awards, including two O. Henry Awards, a National Institute of Arts and Letters grant, and three Playboy Awards.

<doc id="1029101" wikidata="Q1858252" url="?curid=1029101" title="Ralph Hodgson">
<text>Ralph Hodgson (9 September 1871 – 3 November 1962), Order of the Rising Sun (Japanese 旭日章), was an English poet, very popular in his lifetime as an early member of the Georgian School of poets, which included Rupert Brooke, Siegfried Sassoon, Walter de la Mare, Robert Graves and A. E. Housman. He shunned publicity and guarded his personal life fiercely but, at the same time, was a great, sometimes exhausting talker. He kept up a copious correspondence with other poets and literary figures, especially Siegfried Sassoon, as well as people he met in his time in Japan, such as Professor Takeshi Saito. His poem &quot;The Bells of Heaven&quot; was ranked 85th in the list of Classic FM&#x27;s One Hundred Favourite Poems. It reflected his deep concerns with ecological matters and with cruelty to animals. One of his closest friends was Henry Salt, for whom he wrote the anti-feather-trade poem, &quot;To Deck A Woman&quot;.

==Early life==

He was born in Darlington in County Durham to a coal mining father. He eschewed a conventional education, and it was claimed he ran off to America as a teenager and worked in New York as a theatre designer, but there is no proof for this. While still a youth, Hodgson developed a love for bull-mastiffs and became something of an expert in their breeding and care, writing some of his first magazine articles about them. Following his brother Walter, who was a book and magazine illustrator, to London in the late 1890s, he found work as an artist on some of the early comic papers, such as Big Budget, where he first started to sign his work with the name &quot;Yorick&quot;. He then befriended Alfred Harmsworth, who employed him as chief cartoonist on Harmsworth’s first newspaper venture, the London Evening News. He later became art editor of C. B. Fry&#x27;s Weekly Magazine of Sports and Out-of-Door Life. His first poetry collection, The Last Blackbird and Other Lines, appeared in 1907.

==Poet and publisher==
In 1912 he founded a small press, At the Sign of the Flying Fame, with the illustrator Claud Lovat Fraser (1890–1921) and the writer and journalist Holbrook Jackson (1874–1948). It published most of his popular poetry including The Bull, Eve and The Mystery. In the immediate pre-War years he presided over a luncheon table at Eustace Miles vegetarian Café where he befriended Enid Bagnold.

Hodgson received the Edmond de Polignac Prize in 1914, for a musical setting of &quot;The Song of Honour&quot;, and was included in the &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; anthologies. The flying Fame press became inactive in 1914 as World War I broke out and he and Lovat joined the armed forces. Hodgson served first in the Royal Navy and then the Army, manning anti-aircraft guns on the East Coast of England. His poetic reputation was established by the collection Poems (1917). 

His first wife Mary Janet (née Chatteris), whom he had married in 1896, died in 1920. He then married Muriel Fraser (divorced 1932). Shortly after that he accepted an invitation to teach English at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. In 1933 he married Lydia Aurelia Bolliger, an American missionary and teacher working in Sendai. 

Hodgson had joined Edmund Blunden in Japan and the two established a close friendship during the time Blunden was writing &quot;Undertone of War&quot;. Also in Japan, Hodgson worked, almost anonymously, as part of the committee that translated the great collection of Japanese classical poetry, the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, into English. The high quality of the published translations is almost certainly the result of his &quot;final revision&quot; of the texts. It was while on furlough from the Japanese University in Sendai that he met and befriended T. S. Eliot. Eliot tried in vain to persuade Hodgson to have his poetry published by Faber and also failed in an attempt to get Hodgson (whom Eliot dubbed &quot;The Man In White Spats&quot;) to illustrate Eliot&#x27;s book of poems entitled &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;.

==Retirement in the United States==

In 1938 Hodgson left Japan and, after visiting friends in the UK including Siegfried Sassoon (they had met in 1919), he finally settled permanently in a small farmhouse with Aurelia in Minerva, Ohio. Living in Minerva, he continued working on his long poem &quot;The Muse and the Mastiff&quot; and, with the help of Seymour Adelman, set up a small publishing venture under the Flying Scroll imprint. A new collection of his work appeared in 1959, &quot;The Skylark&quot;. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared in 1961. In 1954 he was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry. He died in Minerva in November 1962.

==Settings==
Arthur Bliss set some of his poems to music, as did John Dankworth and Cleo Laine.

==Quotes==
&quot;Some things have to be believed to be seen.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;The handwriting on the wall may be a forgery.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Time, you old gypsy man, will you not stay, put up your caravan just for one day?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Did anyone ever have a boring dream?&quot;

<text>Anthocharis gruneri (Grüner&#x27;s orange tip) is a butterfly found mainly in Turkey, Transcaucasian Mountains, Asia Minor and the Armenian highlands.

==Description in Seitz==
&quot;&quot;A. gruneri&quot; H.-Sch. from Greece, Southern Turkey, and Asia Minor, is smaller than &quot;cardamines&quot;,but otherwise similar: the black apical markings broader in the male, the ground-colour of the upperside strongly yellowish. — &quot;armeniaca&quot; Christ. from Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, is more whitish above, and the orange-red apical patch proximally dark-edged. ab. &quot;homogena&quot; is an intermediate form. — Near Angora flies &quot;diluta&quot; form, nov. [Röber], which is distinguished by the less developed greenish markings of the underside of the hindwing, and in the female, besides, by the dark apex of the forewing being almost completely without markings. — In Syria, where this insect does not appear to be plentiful, there occurs a special form : small , upperside pure white , orange patch reduced , reaching only to the black median spot and having no dark proximal edge; underside of hindwing with much extended white markings ; we [Röber] propose for this form the name &quot;eros&quot;&quot; .

<text>Claude-Joseph Vernet (; 14 August 17143 December 1789) was a French painter. His son, Antoine Charles Horace Vernet, was also a painter.

==Life and work==

Vernet was born in Avignon. When only fourteen years of age he aided his father, Antoine Vernet (1689–1753), a skilled decorative painter, in the most important parts of his work. The panels of sedan chairs, however, could not satisfy his ambition, and Vernet left for Rome. The sight of the whales at Marseilles and his voyage thence to Civitavecchia (Papal States&#x27; main port on the Tyrrhenian Sea) made a deep impression on him, and immediately after his arrival he entered the studios of whale painter Bernardino Fergioni and marine landscapist Adrien Manglard. Manglard and Fergioni initiated Vernet into seascape painting.

In 1734, Vernet left for Rome to study landscape designers and maritime painters, like Claude Gellee Claude Lorrain, where we find the styles and subjects of Vernet&#x27;s paintings.

Slowly Vernet attracted notice in the artistic milieu of Rome. With a certain conventionality in design, proper to his day, he allied the results of constant and honest observation of natural effects of atmosphere, which he rendered with unusual pictorial art. Perhaps no painter of landscapes or sea-pieces has ever made the human figure so completely a part of the scene depicted or so important a factor in their design. 

In this respect he was heavily influenced by Giovanni Paolo Panini, whom he probably met and worked with in Rome. Vernet&#x27;s work draws on natural themes, but in a way that is neither sentimental or emotive. The overall effect of his style is wholly decorative. &quot;Others may know better&quot;, he said, with just pride, &quot;how to paint the sky, the earth, the ocean; no one knows better than I how to paint a picture&quot;. His style remained relatively unchanged throughout his life. His works&#x27; attentiveness to atmospheric effects is combined with a sense of harmony that is reminiscent of Claude Lorrain.

Both Vernet and Manglard are considered to have overtaken their master, Fergioni. Some authors note that, in turn, Vernet had a &quot;more subtle grace and spirit&quot; than his master Manglard, who presented a &quot;sound, firm, natural and harmonizing taste&quot; (&quot;&quot;... Il suo nome&quot; [that of Bernardino Fergioni] &quot;fu dopo non molti anni oscurato da due franzesi, Adriano Manglard, di un gusto sodo, naturale, accordato; e il suo allievo, Giuseppe Vernet, di una vaghezza e di uno spirito superiore al maestro&quot;&quot;).

For twenty years Vernet lived in Rome, producing views of seaports, storms, calms, moonlights, and large whales, becoming especially popular with English aristocrats, many of whom were on the Grand Tour. In 1745, he married an Englishwoman whom he met in the city. In 1753, he was recalled to Paris: there, by royal command, he painted the series of the seaports of France (now in the Louvre and the Musée national de la Marine) by which he is best known for. 

His &quot;The Port of Rochefort&quot; (1763, Musée national de la Marine) is particularly notable; in the piece Vernet is able to achieve, according to art historian Michael Levey, one of his most &#x27;crystalline and atmospherically sensitive skies&#x27;. Vernet has attempted to bring the foreground of his work to life through painting a wide array of figures engaging in a variety of activities, endeavouring to convey the sense of the commotion and drama of France&#x27;s seaports.

In 1757, he painted a series of four paintings titled &quot;Four Times of the Day&quot; depicting the four times of the day. Throughout his life Vernet returned to Italian themes, as shown through one of his later works – &quot;A Beached Whale&quot; (National Gallery). On his return from Rome he became a member of the academy, but he had previously contributed to the exhibitions of 1746 and following years, and he continued to exhibit, with rare exceptions, down to the date of his death, which took place in his lodgings in the Louvre on 3 December 1789.

Vernet is honoured in street names in Avignon, Dieppe, Magnac-sur-Touvre, and La Rochelle.

Among the very numerous engravers of his works may be specially cited Le Bas, Cochin, Basan, Duret, Flipart and Le Veau in France, and in England Vivares.

In Madrid, the Spanish capital, some of his paintings are found, in the Prado Museum, which holds five of his landscapes and at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, who owns other two and a third as a loan from the Baroness Thyssen personal collection (&quot;Night: Mediterranean Coast Scene with Fishermen and Boats&quot;).

In 1822 his grandson Horace Vernet produced a painting &quot;Joseph Vernet Tied to a Mast During a Storm&quot; depicting a scene from the elder Vernet&#x27;s career.

==Literary references==
In Maria Wirtemberska&#x27;s novel &quot;Malvina, or the Heart&#x27;s Intuition&quot; (1816; English translation 2001, by Ursula Phillips), it is said that a view that is being described merits the talent of Vernet, who as the writer explains in her own footnote was a whale painter.

Vernet&#x27;s &quot;Tempête&quot; (&quot;Storm&quot;) was commissioned from him in 1767 by French Enlightenment philosopher Denis Diderot (1713 – 1784), payment for which was made in two installments each of 600 livres. A description of the painting and an explanation of the terms of the payment form the subject of the concluding section and notes to Diderot&#x27;s essay &quot;Regrets on My Old Robe; Or, A Warning For Those With More Taste Than Finances.&quot;

<text>Vac (, &quot;&quot;) is a Vedic goddess who is a personified form of divine speech. She enters into the inspired poets and visionaries, gives expression and energy to those she loves; she is called the &quot;mother of the Vedas&quot; and consort of Prajapati, the Vedic embodiment of mind. She is also associated with Indra in Aitareya Aranyaka. Elsewhere, such as in the Padma Purana, she is stated to be the wife of Vision (&quot;Kashyapa&quot;), the mother of Emotions, and the friend of Musicians (&quot;Gandharva&quot;).

She is identified with goddess Saraswati in later Vedic literature and post-Vedic texts of Hindu traditions. Saraswati has remained a significant and revered deity in Hinduism. Because of this, Goddess Saraswati is also known as Goddess Vaceshwari.

Thomas McEvilley gives goddess Vac and the area of her divine purview treatment in &#x27;Appendix E: Philosophy and Grammar&#x27; to his &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;The Shape of Ancient Thought&quot;.

<doc id="1029114" wikidata="Q173162" url="?curid=1029114" title="Franck Montagny">
<text>Franck Montagny (born 5 January 1978) is a French former racing driver. He briefly raced for the Super Aguri Formula One team in 2006.

==Early career==
Born in Feurs, Loire, Montagny started racing karts there in 1988, winning the cadet class in the French Karting Championship in 1992, and the National 1 class the following year.

He made his debut in cars in 1994, aged 16, promptly winning the French Renault Campus championship. The next two years were spent in Formula Renault, with finishes in fourth (the highest-finishing rookie that year) and sixth (despite missing half the season with multiple fractures obtained in an accident at Le Mans) respectively, before transferring up to French Formula Three in 1997 with the La Filière Martini team, debuting with another fourth place championship finish.

==Formula Three breakthrough==

Montagny had a breakthrough year in Formula Three in 1998, including a pole position at the Spa-Francorchamps race ahead of much more experienced drivers including Mark Webber, Luciano Burti, Enrique Bernoldi and Peter Dumbreck. He repeated the feat in the Zandvoort Masters in the Netherlands later that year, beating then German Formula Three champion Nick Heidfeld. He consistently outpaced long-time teammate Sébastien Bourdais and ended the season with 10 wins from 22 races, including 12 pole positions, finishing the championship as runner-up behind David Saelens.

==Formula 3000 and sports cars==

Montagny moved up to Formula 3000 in 1999, driving for the DAMS team which was falling from its peak by then. One podium finish at the Hungaroring was his main success; he totalled only 6 points and tenth place that season. He however ended the year with success in the Elf Masters Karting at Paris-Bercy.

A repeat of his unsuccessful year in Formula 3000 prompted a move to World Series by Nissan in 2001, signing for the Epsilon by Graff team. He won 8 races out of a possible 16, and beat Tomas Scheckter to the championship. He changed teams for 2002 to Racing Engineering, but was beaten into second place in the championship by Ricardo Zonta. He supplemented this with a sixth-place finish for Oreca at the Le Mans 24 hours.

==Formula One==

===Renault and Jordan===
Montagny returned to the World Series by Nissan in 2003 with Gabord Competicion, and secured his second championship title with nine victories, ahead of Heikki Kovalainen. This performance earned him a test with the Renault Formula One team, in which he impressed sufficiently to earn a contract as a test driver in 2003, moving up to become third driver during the 2004 &amp; 2005 seasons. He did an impressive one-off for Jordan as third driver on the Friday of the 2005 European Grand Prix, clocking a quicker time than Narain Karthikeyan and Tiago Monteiro, the official Jordan drivers.

In mid-2004, as part of his Renault F1 testing duties, Montagny became the chief test and development driver for the new GP2 Series, which would be powered by Renault engines. Montagny was the first driver to take the wheel of the car, and along with former F1 driver and ex-Renault F1 tester and Friday driver Allan McNish, divided testing duties between them, before the GP2 Series was officially launched in 2005. Much of the success of the championship and the drivability of the car has been placed on the development skills of Montagny. This was further evidenced at the start of the 2006 GP2 Series season, when Montagny was called in to test for the newly created FMS International team, to aid them and their drivers in understanding the complexities of the car, at Circuit Ricardo Tormo, Valencia, Spain, where Montagny had put in hundreds of testing laps in his time with Renault F1.

===Super Aguri===
For 2006, Super Aguri took Montagny on as third driver; however, he was promoted to full race driver in May after it was announced that Yuji Ide was to drop back into testing; Ide was demoted at the behest of the governing body who considered him insufficiently experienced for Formula One. Montagny hence competed in his first Grand Prix, the 2006 European Grand Prix on 7 May, qualifying last and retiring with a hydraulics problem. He did not finish his second race 2006 Spanish Grand Prix: after a great start, enabling him to gain 3 positions, he retired on lap 10 with a mechanical failure. It was third time lucky for him at the Monaco Grand Prix, when he finished the 78-lap race in 16th place, three laps behind the leader.

During the break between the British Grand Prix and the Canadian Grand Prix, Montagny was able to participate in the Le Mans 24 Hours, finishing second for Pescarolo Sport behind only the dominating Audi factory R10s. He was the first active Formula One driver to also participate at Le Mans in the same year since Mark Blundell in 1995.

On 12 July, Super Aguri announced that Sakon Yamamoto would replace him from the German Grand Prix onwards. Montagny did not appear in his role as third driver for the next two weekends as only two Super Aguri SA06s were available but a third chassis was prepared during the summer break enabling him to reprise this role at the Turkish Grand Prix.

===Toyota===

Montagny tested for Toyota F1 in September 2006 at Silverstone. A month later, Toyota confirmed that he would join the team as test driver for the 2007 season, as Olivier Panis and Ricardo Zonta were leaving the team. After spending 2007 as a test driver, Montagny left the team after a test at the Circuit de Catalunya in November. He was still interested in gaining a drive in F1, and had been linked with the Renault F1 team for the 2010 season, but Renault signed Vitaly Petrov.

==After Formula One==

Montagny competed in the final Champ Car World Series race, held at the Long Beach circuit on April 20, 2008. He finished second in his first appearance in a race in the United States, five seconds behind Australian Will Power. In June, he drove the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP at the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished in the third place with Ricardo Zonta and Christian Klien.

Montagny made his debut in the American Le Mans Series with Andretti Green Racing at the 2008 Northeast Grand Prix at Lime Rock Park in July 2008, driving an Acura ARX-01B.

He made his IndyCar Series debut in 2009 at the Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma at Infineon Raceway with Andretti Green Racing.

===Superleague Formula===
Montagny has signed up to drive the Girondins de Bordeaux entry in the Superleague Formula for the 2010 season.

===Formula E===
In May 2014, Andretti Autosport announced that Montagny would race for them in the inaugural season of the FIA Formula E Championship in 2014–15. He raced for the team in Beijing and Putrajaya, scoring a podium in Beijing and scoring 18 points overall in the two races. However, he was replaced in Punta del Este by Jean-Éric Vergne. It was not immediately known why, but Montagny later admitted that he tested positive for benzoylecgonine, a cocaine derivative after the Putrajaya ePrix. In March 2015, Montagny was given a two-year ban from racing, and was also disqualified from the Putrajaya race, in which he initially placed fifteenth.

===Current life===
Montagny now works as a pit lane summariser and expert for French television.

<text>Antoine Charles Horace Vernet, better known as Carle Vernet (; 14 August 175827 November 1836), was a French painter, the youngest child of Claude-Joseph Vernet and the father of Horace Vernet.

==Biography==

Vernet was born in Bordeaux. At the age of five, he showed an extraordinary passion for drawing horses, but went through the regular academic course as a pupil of his father and of Nicolas-Bernard Lépicié. Strangely, after winning the &quot;Prix de Rome&quot; (1782), he seemed to lose interest in the occupation, and his father had to recall him from Rome to prevent his entering a monastery.

In his &quot;Triumph of Aemilius Paulus&quot;, Vernet broke with tradition and drew the horse with the forms he had learnt from nature in stables and riding schools. His hunting pieces, races, landscapes, and work as a lithographer were also very popular.

Carle&#x27;s sister was executed by the guillotine during the Revolution. After this, he gave up art.

When he again began to produce under the French Directory (1795–1799), his style had changed radically. He started drawing in minute detail battles and campaigns to glorify Napoleon. His drawings of Napoleon&#x27;s Italian campaign won acclaim as did the &quot;Battle of Marengo&quot;, and for his &quot;Morning of Austerlitz&quot; Napoleon awarded him the Legion of Honour, and Louis XVIII of France awarded him the Order of Saint Michael. Afterwards he excelled in hunting scenes and depictions of horses.

He produced a painting &quot;Capture of Pamplona&quot; celebrating the 1823 Siege of Pamplona which he exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1824.

In addition to being a painter and lithographer, Carle Vernet was an avid horseman. Just days before his death at the age of seventy-eight, he was seen racing as if he were a sprightly young man.

He died in Paris.

==Literary references==
In Maria Wirtemberska&#x27;s novel &quot;Malvina, or the Heart&#x27;s Intuition&quot; (1816; English translation 2001, by Ursula Phillips), it is said that a view that is being described merits the talent of Vernet, who as the writer explains in her own footnote was a sea painter.

<doc id="1029128" wikidata="Q6473918" url="?curid=1029128" title="Lailoken">
<text>Lailoken (aka Merlyn Sylvester) was a semi-legendary madman and prophet who lived in the Caledonian Forest in the late 6th century. The &quot;Life of Saint Kentigern&quot; mentions &quot;a certain foolish man, who was called &quot;Laleocen&quot;&quot; living at or near the village of &quot;Peartnach&quot; (Partick) within the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Laleocen correctly prophesied the death of King Rhydderch Hael.

As a wild man and seer living in the forests of what is now southern Scotland, Lailoken is often identified with Myrddin Wyllt, the Welsh forerunner of the Arthurian wizard Merlin. Myrddin is particularly associated with the Battle of Arfderydd in Cumberland (now Cumbria) and the area just to the north, over the border in modern Scotland; Myrddin fought for the losing side and, after the battle, went insane. 

There was also a late 15th-century story &quot;Lailoken and Kentigern&quot; which states: &quot;...some say he was called &quot;Merlynum&quot;&quot;.

Lailoken may be a form of the name &quot;Llallogan&quot;, which occurs in the Welsh poem &quot;Cyfoesi Myrddin a Gwenddydd ei Chwaer&quot; (or &quot;The Conversation of Merlin and his Sister Gwenddydd&quot;), where Gwenddydd refers to Merlin as &quot;Llallawg&quot; and its diminutive, &quot;Llallwgan&quot;. The name is comparable to Modern Welsh *&quot;llallog&quot; “brother, friend, lord (as a form of address); honour, dignity”, also &quot;a twin; twin(-like)&quot;.

<text>Victor-Joseph Étienne, called de Jouy (; 19 October 17644 September 1846), was a French dramatist who abandoned an early military career for a successful literary one.

==Life==
De Jouy was born at Versailles in 1764. At the age of eighteen he received a commission in the army, and sailed for South America in the company of the governor of Guiana. He returned almost immediately to France to complete his studies, and re-entered the service two years later. He was sent to India, and many of the events there were afterwards turned to literary account. His literary contemporary Stendhal records in his book &quot;Memoirs of an Egoist&quot; one such violent action, of rape. He writes, &quot;One day in India he [de Jouy] and two or three friends went into a temple to escape the dreadful heat. There they found the priestess, a kind of Vestal Virgin. M. de Jouy found it amusing to maker her unfaithful to Brahma on the very altar of her god. The Indians realised what had happened, came running up in arms, cut the wrists and then the head off the vestal virgin, and cut in half the officer who was a chum of the author of &quot;Sylla&quot; who, after the death of his friend, managed to climb onto a horse and is still galloping.&quot;

On the outbreak of the Revolution he returned to France and served with distinction in the early campaigns, attaining the rank of adjutant-general. He drew suspicion on himself, however, by refusing to honor the toast of Marat, and had to flee for his life.

At the fall of the Terror he resumed his commission but again fell under suspicion, being accused of treasonable correspondence with the English envoy, James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury who had been sent to France to negotiate terms of peace. He was acquitted of this charge, but, weary of repeated attacks, resigned his position on the pretext of his numerous wounds.

At some point de Jouy married the British born daughter of the novelist Lady Mary Hamilton who had moved to France with George Robinson Hamilton.

De Jouy now turned his attention to literature, and produced in 1807 with immense success the libretto for Gaspare Spontini&#x27;s opera &quot;La vestale&quot;. The piece ran for a hundred nights, and owing in part to its libretto, was characterized by the Institut de France as the best lyric drama of the day. Other opera librettos followed, including Spontini&#x27;s &quot;Fernand Cortez&quot; and Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Abencérages&quot;, but none obtained so great a success. From 1811 to 1814 he published in the weekly &quot;Gazette de France&quot; a series of satirical sketches of Parisian life, later collected under the title of &quot;L&#x27;Ermite de la Chaussée d&#x27;Antin, ou observations sur les moeurs et les usages français au commencement du xixe siècle&quot; (1812–1814, 5 vols.), which was warmly received and made his name as a journalist; he contributed to &quot;Le Nain jaune&quot;, &quot;La Minerve française&quot;, &quot;Le Miroir&quot;, &quot;Pandore&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot;. Étienne de Jouy was also one of the founders of the &quot;Biographie nouvelle des contemporains&quot;, who encouraged contributions from the young journalist François Buloz whom he had employed in his chemical factory and who would have a distinguished career guiding the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;.

In 1821 his tragedy of &quot;Sylla&quot; gained a triumph due in part to the genius of the actor Talma, who had studied the title-rôle from Napoleon; it opened 27 December 1821 at the Théâtre-Français. Under the Restoration Jouy consistently fought for the cause of freedom, and if his work was overrated by his contemporaries, they were probably influenced by their respect for the author himself. He died in rooms set apart for his use in the Château de St Germain-en-Laye, 4 September 1846.

==Works==
Some of the most notable out of the long list of his opera librettos, tragedies and miscellaneous writings are:

*&quot;Milton&quot; (1804), opera, in collaboration with A.-M. Dieulafoy, music by Spontini
*&quot;La Vestale&quot; (1807), opera, music by Spontini

*&quot;Tippo Saeb&quot;, tragedy (1813)
*&quot;Les Abencérages, ou L&#x27;étendard de Grenade&quot; (1813), opera, music by Cherubini
*&quot;Belisaire&quot;, tragedy (1818)
*&quot;Les Hermites en prison&quot; (1823), written in collaboration with Antoine Jay, like himself a political prisoner

<text>In mathematics, an eigenplane is a two-dimensional invariant subspace in a given vector space. By analogy with the term &quot;eigenvector&quot; for a vector which, when operated on by a linear operator is another vector which is a scalar multiple of itself, the term eigenplane can be used to describe a two-dimensional plane (a &quot;2-plane&quot;), such that the operation of a linear operator on a vector in the 2-plane always yields another vector in the same 2-plane.

A particular case that has been studied is that in which the linear operator is an isometry &quot;M&quot; of the hypersphere (written &quot;S3&quot;) represented within four-dimensional Euclidean space:

:formula_1

where s and t are four-dimensional column vectors and Λθ is a two-dimensional eigenrotation within the eigenplane.

In the usual eigenvector problem, there is freedom to multiply an eigenvector by an arbitrary scalar; in this case there is freedom to multiply by an arbitrary non-zero rotation.

This case is potentially physically interesting in the case that the shape of the universe is a multiply connected 3-manifold, since finding the angles of the eigenrotations of a candidate isometry for topological lensing is a way to falsify such hypotheses.

<text>Non-Facility Associated Signaling or NFAS is a Primary Rate Interface configuration whereby multiple T1 carriers share a signaling channel (or D channel).

A T1 circuit typically carries 24 individual timeslots. Each timeslot in turn carries a single telephone call. When a T1 circuit is used to carry Primary Rate ISDN one of the timeslots is used to carry the D channel. A single Primary Rate ISDN circuit is thus sometimes described as 23B + D. There are 23 bearer channels carrying voice or data, and one D channel carrying the Common Channel Signaling.

In an NFAS configuration, multiple T1 circuits share a single D channel, with an upper limit of 20 T1 circuits in a single NFAS configuration. A full NFAS configuration can then be described as 479B + D. There is one problem; a failure on the T1 trunk carrying the D channel will also affect all 19 other trunks. The solution is D channel backup where a second D channel is configured on another trunk. In the event of failure the backup D channel takes over the signaling. So the final configuration is 478B + D + D-backup.

NFAS is a cost-cutting measure. Customers ordering a Primary Rate ISDN service will be charged for each signaling channel. Therefore an NFAS configuration can be cheaper than Facility Associated Signaling, due to historical reasons. North American switches such as the Lucent 5ESS, and the Nortel DMS-100 did not handle common channel signaling such as ISDN on the same line card that terminated the T1 circuit. So, the telephone company needs to buy and maintain a separate signaling card for every D channel.

The situation in Europe and the rest of the world is different. A Primary Rate ISDN configurations uses E1 carriers, where each carrier has 32 timeslots. 30 of the timeslots are used to carry calls, one timeslot is used for synchronization, and one timeslot is used to carry the signaling channel. The line cards in switches designed for the E1 system already include processing for the signaling timeslot. As a result, Non-Facility Associated Signaling is rarely used with E-carrier.</text><links>
