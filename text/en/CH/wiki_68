<text>Nicole Evangeline Lilly (born August 3, 1979) is a retired Canadian actress and author. She gained popularity for her first leading role as Kate Austen in the ABC drama series &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2010), which garnered her six nominations for the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series.

Lilly has also appeared in the war film &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; (2008) and sports drama &quot;Real Steel&quot; (2011), and has starred as Tauriel in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series, appearing in &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; (2014). She has also portrayed Hope van Dyne in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Lilly is also the author of a children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Squickerwonkers&quot;.

==Early life ==
Lilly was born in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, on August 3, 1979. She was raised in British Columbia by her mother, a daycare center owner, and her father, a home economics teacher. She has an older sister and a younger sister. Lilly was raised Baptist and Mennonite.

Lilly graduated from W. J. Mouat Secondary School in Abbotsford, British Columbia, with a 4.3 GPA; she was captain of the soccer team and vice president of the student council. In university, she was a waitress, did &quot;oil-changes and grease-jobs on big rig trucks&quot;, and was a flight attendant for Royal Airlines to pay for her tuition. Her interest in humanitarian causes and world development led her to major in international relations at the University of British Columbia.

==Career==
===2002–2003: Early career===
Lilly&#x27;s acting career began when she was discovered by a Ford Modelling Agency agent while passing the time in Kelowna, British Columbia. She took the agent&#x27;s business card but did not immediately pursue acting. She eventually called and the agency landed her several roles in commercials and non-speaking parts in the TV shows &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot;. She was also on a video game news and review show on the gaming television channel G4TV.

===2004–2007: Breakthrough with &quot;Lost&quot;===

In late 2003, Lilly was encouraged by a friend to audition for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Lost&quot;, but did not expect to be cast. The secrecy campaign meant auditioning actors could not see the full script, could read only short scenes, and knew only the basic premise of people surviving a plane crash on a tropical island. It reminded Lilly of &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;, and she thought &quot;Lost&quot; would &quot;at best be a mediocre TV show&quot;. Around 75 women auditioned for the part of Kate Austen. Writer and co-creator Damon Lindelof said that he and executive producer and co-creator J. J. Abrams &quot;...were fast-forwarding through a tape and he saw her and said: &#x27;That&#x27;s the girl!&#x27;&quot; The character almost had to be recast, as Lilly had trouble acquiring a work visa to enter the United States. Her application was finally accepted after nearly 20 tries; she arrived in Hawaii for filming one day late.

&quot;Lost&quot; ran for six seasons, from 2004 to 2010. It was one of ABC&#x27;s top primetime shows, winning one Golden Globe Award and ten Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2005, and was ranked the top-rated TV show of the decade by IMDb. Lilly was between 24 and 30 years of age during the show&#x27;s run, appearing in 108 of 121 episodes, as her character, Kate Austen, was the show&#x27;s female lead. In 2006 she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; praised Lilly&#x27;s performance in the episode named &quot;Eggtown&quot;, saying it was almost worthy of a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series nomination. After shooting the final episode of &quot;Lost&quot;, Lilly said she was considering taking a break from acting to focus on her charity and humanitarian efforts. She told &quot;Vulture&quot;: &quot;I consider acting a day job—it&#x27;s not my dream; it&#x27;s not my be-all, end-all.&quot; She says she uses her high-profile roles to further her humanitarian efforts, not to achieve stardom.

===2008–2014: Established actress===

In 2008, Lilly appeared in the film &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, directed by Kathryn Bigelow. The film received widespread acclaim and went on to be nominated in nine categories at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning six of these including Best Picture. Lilly and the cast won the Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Ensemble Cast and the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Award for Best Ensemble. That same year, Lilly had a leading role in the psychological thriller film &quot;Afterwards&quot;.

In May 2010, Lilly announced on &quot;The View&quot; that being a mother was her top priority, but that she liked acting as a &quot;day job&quot; and would continue it when possible. She took a short hiatus that year and was not in contact with Hollywood.

In 2011, despite turning down a number of film offers, Lilly appeared as Bailey Tallet, a boxing gym owner, in &quot;Real Steel&quot; alongside Hugh Jackman. She accepted the role after director Shawn Levy sent her the script. Levy noted that Lilly was &quot;magnificent to look&quot; and that he &quot;needed someone who you believed had grown up in a man&#x27;s world; Bailey needed to have a strength and a toughness that was not at the expense of her being womanly&quot;. &quot;Real Steel&quot; went on to be nominated for Best Visual Effects at the 84th Academy Awards. During promotion for the film, Lilly turned down a role in the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise from Jackman, noting that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t into superhero movies&quot; at the time.

In 2012, Lilly was cast as the Mirkwood elf Tauriel in Peter Jackson&#x27;s three-part adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The character, which does not appear in the original book by Tolkien, was created by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh as the head of the Elven guard. For the role, Lilly underwent training for swordplay, archery and speaking the Elvish language. Lilly described Tauriel as a nonconformist, noting that she tends to &quot;rebel against the established social order of the Elves&quot;. Lilly appeared as the character in &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot; (2013) and its sequel, &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; (2014).

===2015–2023: &quot;Ant-Man&quot; films and other work ===

In 2015, Lilly played Hope van Dyne, the daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, in the superhero film &quot;Ant-Man&quot; as a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Lilly described her character as &quot;capable, strong, and kick-ass&quot;, but said that being raised by two superheroes resulted in Hope being &quot;a pretty screwed up human being [...] and the clear message sent by my name is that I&#x27;m not a big fan of my father and so I took my mother&#x27;s name.&quot; Lilly also signed a multi-film contract with Marvel.&lt;ref name=&quot;/Film65Things4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The film received generally positive reviews.

In 2017, Lilly starred in the Netflix horror film &quot;Little Evil&quot; alongside Adam Scott. In 2018, she reprised her role as Van Dyne in &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; (2018), donning the superhero mantle of the Wasp which had been teased in the first film during an end credits scene. The film received generally positive reviews with Lilly&#x27;s performance being praised. The Wasp became the first superheroine to be a titular character in an MCU film. Lilly also reprised her role in &quot;&quot; (2019). That same year, Lilly was set to star in a film titled &quot;Happy Place&quot; alongside Ike Barinholtz.

In 2021, she starred with Armie Hammer and Gary Oldman in &quot;Crisis&quot;, directed by Nicholas Jarecki. That same year, she also starred in &quot;South of Heaven&quot; alongside Jason Sudeikis and Mike Colter. The latter won her Best Actress at the AFIN International Film Festival. Lilly also voiced an alternate version of the Wasp in the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021). She voiced Van Dyne in the episode &quot;What If... Zombies?!&quot;, and received positive reviews.

In February 2023, Lilly reprised her role as Hope van Dyne / Wasp in &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;, released as the first film of Phase Five of the MCU. That same month, it was announced that Lilly would voice a character in the English version of the animated historic epic Israeli film, &quot;Legend of Destruction&quot;, which was originally released in 2021 in Hebrew. Lilly voiced the &quot;last Jewish queen, Berenice of Cilicia, who did her best to protect her people [...] even at the cost of her life&quot;, in which Lilly noted was &quot;really brutal and sad, but it&#x27;s true&quot;.

===2024–present: Retirement ===
In June 2024, Lilly announced that she was &quot;stepping away&quot; from acting to focus on her family. She noted that &quot;I might return to Hollywood one day, but for now this is where I belong.&quot;

==In the media==

===Public image===
After gaining recognition for her role as Kate Austen in &quot;Lost&quot;, Lilly began to appear in the media and was regularly included in &quot;Most Beautiful&quot; lists. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted Lilly one of its &quot;Breakout Stars of 2004&quot;. That same year, Lilly was voted one of &quot;People&quot; &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot;. In 2007, her portrayal of Austen was voted the number one &quot;Sexiest Woman on Television&quot; by &quot;TV Guide&quot; and made &quot;FHM&quot; Top Sexiest.

Lilly is noted for playing &quot;strong, tragic, and even a bit snarky&quot; characters. Lilly&#x27;s roles in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Tauriel and Hope van Dyne / Wasp respectively, have received critical acclaim.
 For her performance as Tauriel, Lilly was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie, the Empire Award for Best Supporting Actress, and a Kid&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Female Buttkicker.

===Charity work===
Lilly works with non-profits such as the GO Campaign. In 2009, Lilly auctioned off custom lingerie in support of Task Brasil, &quot;a non-profit organization dedicated to helping the lost street children of Brazil by providing them secure housing&quot;. In 2010, she auctioned off three lunches in Vancouver, Honolulu, and Los Angeles to help widows and orphans in Rwanda, a country she has made numerous trips to as part of her charity work. In 2012, Lilly auctioned off a Hawaiian hike to raise money for the Sierra Club.

==Writing==
On set of &quot;Lost&quot; in 2006, Lilly noted in an interview that she wanted to be a writer. On July 18, 2013, Lilly debuted her book series, titled &quot;The Squickerwonkers&quot; at San Diego Comic-Con centered around a young girl who joins a group of characters described as a &quot;family&quot; who are all &quot;strange outcasts&quot; and have &quot;very particular vices&quot;.

In 2014, Titan Books released the first title of &quot;The Squickerwonkers&quot; titled &quot;The Squickerwonkers: The Prequel&quot; (2014) with the foreword written by Peter Jackson. Three main titles titled &quot;The Squickerwonkers, Act 1: The Demise of Selma the Spoiled&quot; (2018), &quot;The Squickerwonkers, Act 2: The Demise of Lorna the Lazy&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Squickerwonkers, Act 3: The Demise of Andy the Arrogant&quot; (2019) were self-published by Quiet Cocoon Productions with Rodrigo Bastos Didier taking over as illustrator. Lilly has stated that her literary inspirations are Roald Dahl and Edward Gorey.

==Personal life==
Lilly was raised Baptist and Mennonite and described herself as &quot;very devout and evangelical&quot;. She has been involved in humanitarian work for 13 years in Rwanda where she runs an NGO.

Lilly was married to hockey player Murray Hone from 2003 to 2004. She was in a relationship with English actor and &quot;Lost&quot; costar Dominic Monaghan from 2004 to 2007. In 2010, Lilly began a relationship with Norman Kali. She gave birth to a son, in 2011. Their second son was born in October 2015.

On 20 December 2006, an electrical problem set fire to Lilly&#x27;s house in Kailua, Hawaii, destroying the house and all of her possessions while she was on the set of &quot;Lost&quot;. Though she lost all of her belongings, she said that the fire was &quot;almost liberating&quot; and that she was &quot;in no hurry to clutter up [her] life again&quot;.

On 16 March 2020, Lilly received mixed responses when she refused to self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, said it was &quot;business as usual&quot; on Instagram, and claimed that she values &quot;freedom over [her] life&quot;. On 26 March, she apologized for her comments and called them &quot;dismissive, arrogant, and cryptic&quot;. On 27 January 2022, she posted a photo on Instagram showing that she had taken part in a march against COVID-19 vaccine mandates in Washington, D.C., and said that &quot;nobody should ever be forced to inject their body with anything, against their will&quot;. On 18 February, amidst the Canada convoy protest against federal COVID-19 mandates, she urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to meet with the protestors.

<text>The Montreal Royals were a minor league professional baseball team in Montreal, Quebec, during 1897–1917 and 1928–1960. A member of the International League, the Royals were the top farm club (Class AAA) of the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1939; pioneering African-American player Jackie Robinson was a member for the 1946 season. The 1946 Royals were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.

==History==
In 1928, George Stallings, a former Major League Baseball executive and Southern United States planter, formed a partnership with Montreal lawyer and politician Athanase David and businessman Ernest Savard to resurrect the Montreal Royals. Among the team&#x27;s other local affluent notables were close friends Lucien Beauregard, Romeo Gauvreau, Hector H. Racine, and Charles E. Trudeau. Trudeau, businessman and father of the future 15th Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau (and grandfather to the 23rd Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau), would remain on the Montreal Baseball Club Inc. Board of Directors until his death in 1935. Together these men financed and built Delorimier Stadium &quot;(also known as Montreal Stadium, Hector Racine Stadium and Delorimier Downs)&quot; at Delorimier Avenue and Ontario Street in east-end Montreal to serve as the team&#x27;s home field.

This version of the Montreal Royals enjoyed great success, particularly after it became the top farm team of the Dodgers in 1939. The Royals launched the baseball careers of Sparky Anderson, Gene Mauch, Roberto Clemente and the man who broke Major League Baseball&#x27;s color barrier with Montreal in 1946, Jackie Robinson. Other Royals&#x27; players of note include Duke Snider, Don Drysdale, Chuck Connors, Walter Alston, Roy Campanella, Johnny Podres and the winningest pitcher in the history of the team, Tommy Lasorda.
The team holds a unique place in baseball history for being the first major-league affiliate to break the so-called &quot;baseball colour barrier&quot;. On October 23, 1945, two members of the Brooklyn National League Baseball Club Inc. Board of Directors, Montreal Royals owner and team president, Hector Racine, and Brooklyn Dodgers general manager, Branch Rickey, signed Jackie Robinson, an African-American. Robinson played with the Royals during the 1946 season. John Wright and Roy Partlow, black pitchers, also played with the Royals that year.
During that season, Robinson faced the race-related resistance from his manager (a Mississippian, Clay Hopper) and teammates but soon won them over with his masterful play (beginning with his spectacular debut in the opening game against the Jersey City Giants) and courage facing hostile crowds and opponents. As for his home city, he was welcomed immediately by the public, who followed his performance that season with intense adoration. For the rest of his life, Robinson remained grateful to the people of Montreal for making the city a welcoming oasis for him and his wife during that difficult 1946 season. They lived in an apartment in a white neighbourhood of Montreal that summer.
Robinson then left to play for the Dodgers the following year, but not before winning the Little World Series and being chased by exultant Montreal fans right to the train as he left. In Ken Burns&#x27; documentary film &quot;Baseball&quot;, the narrator quotes Sam Maltin, a sports journalist with the Montreal Herald&quot;:&quot; &quot;It was probably the only day in history that a black man ran from a white mob with love instead of lynching on its mind.&quot;

The Royals continued through the 1960 season, two years after the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. On September 13, 1960, Dodgers President Walter O&#x27;Malley announced that due to weak attendance, the Dodgers were ending their 21-year affiliation with the team. While a new affiliation with the Minnesota Twins was arranged, efforts to keep the team in Montreal failed, and the franchise was relocated to Syracuse, New York for 1961, and became the Syracuse Chiefs. Montreal would gain an MLB team, the Expos, in 1969; &quot;Royals&quot; was suggested as a nickname for that team but was taken instead by the new American League club in Kansas City.

The Royals won the Governors&#x27; Cup, the championship of the IL, 7 times, and played in the championship series 11 times.

<text>Quercus tomentella, the island oak, island live oak, or Channel Island oak, is an oak in the section &quot;Protobalanus&quot;. It is native to six islands: five of the Channel Islands of California and Guadalupe Island, part of Baja California.

It is placed in &quot;Quercus&quot; section &quot;Protobalanus&quot;.

==Description==
Island oak is a tree growing up to in height. The mature tree has a grayish to reddish brown trunk with scaly, furrowed bark. The twigs are reddish and covered in woolly hairs. The leathery leaf blades are often concave and are an oblong lance shape or oval with pointed or rounded tips. The edges are smooth or toothed. The upper surfaces are dark green and lightly hairy when new, losing the hairs over time. The undersides are gray-green and coated in woolly hairs, becoming less woolly with age. They are usually long, sometimes up to . The acorn grows singly or in pairs. The cup has thick scales and woolly hairs and is up to wide. The nut is up to 3.5&quot; &quot;cm with a rounded tip.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is native to six islands: five of the Channel Islands of California (Anacapa Island, San Clemente Island, Santa Catalina Island, Santa Cruz Island, and Santa Rosa Island) and Guadalupe Island, part of the State of Baja California.

This species is a relict. Though it is now limited to the islands, it was once widespread in mainland California, as evidenced by the many late Tertiary fossils of the species found there. Recently, it was found that there was a high genetic variability across many of the &quot;Q. tomentella&quot; populations, but this variation was not evenly distributed.

==Ecology==
Island oak hybridizes with canyon live oak (&quot;Quercus chrysolepis&quot;).

==Conservation==
The island oak was listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The species is threatened by overgrazing from nonnative ungulates. The most rapid declines have occurred on Guadalupe Island. The trees there are apparently no longer reproducing. Feral goats have been abundant on the island for at least 150 years. The animals have eliminated much of the native vegetation and caused extensive soil erosion. Fenced enclosures have been helpful in the early recovery of some of the local flora.

<text>Richard Cole (2 January 1946 – 2 December 2021) was an English music manager, who was involved in the rock music business from the mid-1960s to 2003. He is most known for having been the tour manager of English rock band Led Zeppelin from 1968 to 1980.

==Early career==
Cole was born in Kensal Rise, in the north London borough of Brent. His father was an architect who worked for Rolls-Royce vehicle design, and later in aircraft assembly during World War II. At the age of 12, Cole became interested in music after hearing Elvis Presley and The Everly Brothers. He left school aged 15, and from his first job, working at a dairy factory in Acton, earned enough money to purchase a drumkit, on which he practiced along with Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa records. The low wages forced Cole to take up an apprenticeship in sheet-metal working whilst also working as a scaffolder on construction sites. He was also very interested in the fashion industry, at one point harbouring plans to be a fashion designer, and he claimed to have designed the shirts worn by John Lennon and Ringo Starr on the &quot;Revolver&quot; album cover, and to have contributed to the album&#x27;s graphics.

Cole was drawn into the music business after meeting Richard Green, journalist for the &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, at the Marquee Club in 1965. Green suggested that Cole contact John Barker, the manager of pop band Unit 4 + 2, for a job as their road manager. Barker gave Cole the job, and he soon became one of rock&#x27;s most respected tour managers, working for The Who in 1965 and The New Vaudeville Band in 1966. In 1967 Cole moved to the United States and worked for Vanilla Fudge as a sound engineer. When he heard that The Yardbirds were coming to the US in 1968, he contacted their manager Peter Grant, whom he had previously known when Grant was the manager of the New Vaudeville Band, and became their tour manager. When The Yardbirds dissolved shortly thereafter, Grant and Cole became the manager and tour manager respectively of Led Zeppelin.

==Led Zeppelin==
Cole was one of the first tour managers to specialise in the American tours of English bands. Instead of hiring equipment in the United States and using an American crew to service the band, as was the custom until that point, Cole implemented the new practice of bringing over all the equipment and an entirely English crew. Cole claimed &quot;I fucking reorganized that very sharply. I said &#x27;Fuck that. Let&#x27;s take our own equipment over there, wot we&#x27;re used to working on&#x27;.&quot; This practice subsequently became commonplace for other bands touring the US.

On 23 December 1968, Cole booked Led Zeppelin into the Chateau Marmont on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles and later at the nearby Continental Hyatt House, also known as &quot;The Riot House&quot;. Cole was also responsible for introducing groupies, some of whom he had known on previous tours with The Yardbirds and The Who, to members of the band.

Cole was responsible for collecting box office takings and keeping receipts on behalf of the band for Led Zeppelin concert tours. During Led Zeppelin&#x27;s final show at Madison Square Garden in New York in July 1973 during their 1973 North American tour, more than US$203,000 disappeared from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel. The police at first suspected Cole as being responsible for the theft. Cole was entrusted with the key to the safe deposit box at the time of the theft and he was the first person at the scene to discover that the money was unaccounted for. He took a lie detector test and was cleared of any involvement. The money was never recovered, and neither Cole nor anyone associated with Led Zeppelin was ever charged. The Drake Hotel was later sued over the incident.

In 1977, manager Peter Grant gave his approval for Cole to hire John Bindon to act as security co-ordinator for the band&#x27;s concert tour of the United States. Bindon had previously provided security for actors Ryan and Tatum O&#x27;Neal. Towards the end of the tour, a major incident occurred during a concert at the Oakland Coliseum on 23 July 1977. Upon arrival at the stadium, it was alleged that Bindon pushed a member of promoter Bill Graham&#x27;s stage crew out of the way as the band entered via a backstage ramp. Tension had been simmering between Graham&#x27;s staff and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s security team during the day, and as Grant and Bindon were walking down the ramp near the end of the concert, words were exchanged with stage crew chief Jim Downey, which resulted in Bindon knocking Downey out cold.

Within minutes a separate off-stage incident, involving Graham&#x27;s security man Jim Matzorkis (who was accused of slapping Peter Grant&#x27;s 11-year-old son Warren over the removal of a dressing room sign), escalated into an all-out brawl in which Matzorkis was brutally beaten. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s second Oakland show took place only after Bill Graham signed a letter of indemnification, absolving Led Zeppelin from responsibility for the previous night&#x27;s incident. However, Graham refused to honour the letter, and assault charges were laid against Grant, Cole, Bindon, and John Bonham when the band arrived back at their hotel. All four pleaded &quot;nolo contendere&quot; and received suspended sentences. Bindon was dismissed by Grant and returned to England. Grant later stated that allowing Bindon to be hired was the biggest mistake he ever made as manager.

Whilst tour manager for Led Zeppelin, Cole developed substance abuse problems. He was fired from his position as road manager for Led Zeppelin&#x27;s final concert tour of Europe in 1980 because Peter Grant was concerned about his drug and alcohol abuse, and was replaced by Phil Carlo. Sent to Italy to detox, Cole was mistaken for a terrorist involved in the 1980 Bologna railway station bombing and was temporarily imprisoned.

==Post-Led Zeppelin==
After the end of his involvement with Led Zeppelin, Cole served as the tour manager for Eric Clapton, Black Sabbath, Lita Ford, Ozzy Osbourne, Edan Everly, Black Uhuru, and Three Dog Night, managed Fem 2 Fem and, most recently, toured with Gipsy Kings, Crazy Town and Fu Manchu. According to his publisher HarperCollins, he divided his time between Venice, California, and London.

===Contributions to published accounts===
Following Led Zeppelin&#x27;s breakup in 1980, Cole contributed to unofficial Led Zeppelin biographies, most infamously Stephen Davis&#x27; biography &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot;. Cole claimed he was only paid $1250 by Davis for his revelations, which make up a large proportion of the book. Davis for his part has claimed that Cole &quot;was responsible for much of the mayhem around Led Zeppelin.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;New Musical Express&quot; magazine in 1985, Robert Plant dismissed many of the claims made by Cole in Davis&#x27; book, and discussed why Cole was removed as tour manager:

Cole also wrote his own book, an unofficial account of the band called &quot;Stairway to Heaven: Led Zeppelin Uncensored&quot;, with Richard Trubo. Cole&#x27;s book raised the ire of Jimmy Page, who once commented:

Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones expressed similar views about Cole&#x27;s reliability, stating in a magazine interview that Cole&#x27;s accounts are &quot;a mish-mash of several stories put together, usually with the wrong endings and making us look like miserable bastards rather than the funsters we were.&quot; Jones was so incensed at the depiction of John Bonham in Cole&#x27;s book &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; that he decided never to speak to Cole again. In an interview with &quot;PR-Inside&quot; online magazine, Jones also claimed when he had once asked Cole about why he&#x27;d exaggerated the group&#x27;s behaviour for that book, Cole explained that &quot;he&#x27;d been a drug addict who needed the money&quot;.

Despite the bitterness felt by Plant, Page, and Jones about their former road manager, Cole was invited to the VIP section of the Led Zeppelin reunion in 2007.

==Death==
Cole died at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 2 December 2021, at the age of 75 after a battle with cancer.

<doc id="1031292" wikidata="Q1123891" url="?curid=1031292" title="Brotherhood of the Wolf">
<text>Brotherhood of the Wolf () is a 2001 French period action horror film directed by Christophe Gans, co-written by Gans and Stéphane Cabel, and starring Samuel Le Bihan, Mark Dacascos, Émilie Dequenne, Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel. The story takes place in 18th-century France, where the Chevalier de Fronsac and Mani of the Iroquois tribe are sent to investigate the mysterious slaughter of hundreds by an unknown creature in the county of Gévaudan.

The plot is loosely based on a real-life series of killings that took place in France in the 18th century and the famous legend of the beast of Gévaudan; parts of the film were shot at Château de Roquetaillade. The film has several extended swashbuckling fight scenes, with martial arts performances by the cast mixed in, making it unusual for a historical drama. The special effects for the creature are a combination of computer generated imagery, as well as puppetry and animatronics designed by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop.

The film received generally positive critical reviews, highlighting its high production values, cinematography, performances and Gans&#x27;s atmospheric direction. At a $29 million budget, it was a commercial success, grossing over $70 million in worldwide theatrical release. The film also became the sixth-highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the United States, and it also became one of the biggest international successes for French-language films. The film&#x27;s 4K restored &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; version premiered in the Official Selection of 2022 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
During the French Revolution, Marquis d&#x27;Apcher writes his memoirs in his castle. He recounts his experiences in 1764, when a mysterious beast terrorized the county, or historical area, of Gévaudan. Grégoire de Fronsac, a knight and the royal naturalist of King Louis XV of France, and his Iroquois companion Mani, arrive to capture the beast. Fronsac becomes interested in Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-François, was also an avid hunter and a world traveller, whose arm was mangled and rendered useless while overseas. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel.

While investigating another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel. A traumatized child witness swears that the beast is controlled by what seems to be a human master. As the investigation proves unfruitful, the king&#x27;s weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives to put an end to the beast, and Fronsac is sent back to Paris. He realizes that the beast is actually an instrument of a secret society: The Brotherhood of the Wolf, which is working to undermine public confidence in the king and ultimately take over the country. Back in Gévaudan, the attacks by the real beast continue, and Fronsac returns to put an end to the beast&#x27;s killings. At a secret rendezvous with Marianne, they are attacked by the beast, where it mysteriously refrains from attacking her.

Fronsac, Mani, and a young Marquis set out into the forest and set up an array of traps to capture the beast; it is severely injured but escapes. Mani sets off alone in pursuit, where he finds a catacomb used as the beast&#x27;s holding pen, inhabited by the Brotherhood. Outnumbered, Mani is shot and killed. Fronsac discovers Mani&#x27;s body and performs an autopsy, finding a silver bullet— Jean-François&#x27; signature choice of ammunition. In a fit of rage, a vengeful Fronsac goes to the catacombs and slaughters many members, but is overpowered by the local authorities and imprisoned.

Sylvia visits him in jail and reveals that she is a spy for the Holy See. She explains that Henri Sardis, the local priest and leader of the Brotherhood, believes that he is restoring worship of God to France. Pope Clement XIII has decided that Sardis is insane, and has sent her to eliminate him. She then poisons Fronsac, saying that he knows too much. Meanwhile, Jean-François comes to Marianne&#x27;s room and reveals to her that he is the beast&#x27;s master; it recognized his scent on her when it came near her, which is why it did not attack. He then rapes her when she rejects his advances.

Sylvia&#x27;s agents exhume Fronsac and he appears at one of the Brotherhood&#x27;s sermons. He kills several members, including Jean-François, who reveals that he had regained use of his supposedly mangled arm. Sardis escapes into the mountains, but is mauled to death by a pack of wolves. Fronsac and the Marquis go to the beast&#x27;s lair, where it lies severely wounded. It turns out that the beast was a lion that Jean-François brought back from Africa as a cub that was tortured into becoming vicious and trained to wear spiked metal armor. Fronsac takes pity and kills the beast in an act of mercy.

Marquis d&#x27;Apcher finishes writing his account just before he is led to his execution by a revolutionary mob. He states that he doesn&#x27;t know what happened to Fronsac and Marianne after the death of the beast; but he hopes that somewhere, they are happy together. A final scene shows Fronsac and Marianne sailing on a ship named Frère Loup— Brother Wolf.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; garnered mostly positive reviews, with a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 119 reviews with the consensus stating: &quot;&quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; mixes its genres with little logic, but the end result is wildly entertaining.&quot; whereas on Metacritic it accumulated a score of 57 from mixed reviews. The usage of various cinematographic techniques employed by Christophe Gans, the fight sequences, the atmosphere and particularly the performance of Marc Dacascos as the native-American Mani attracted particularly strong praise.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded it with a 3/4-star rating, describing the film as resembling &quot;an explosion at the genre factory&quot;, though he added: &quot;I would be lying if I did not admit that this is all, in its absurd and overheated way, entertaining.&quot; James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; also rated the movie three stars out of four, saying that it &quot;has something in it to appeal to just about everyone&quot; and that it is &quot;daring in its approach and successful in its result – assuming the result is to provide pure entertainment to the viewer.&quot; Michael Atkinson of &quot;Village Voice&quot; wrote &quot;It&#x27;s easily the most disarming and inventive movie made for genre geeks in years.&quot; Harry Knowles of &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot; wrote that this film is &quot;exciting, alluring and thrilling&quot;, whereas &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film a three-star rating out of five stating that &quot;An undeniably handsome creation, but its excessive length and surplus of directorial flourishes merely exacerbate the emptiness of an initially promising plot&quot;. Lisa Nesselson from &quot;Variety&quot; gave a positive review mentioning that &quot;a little Sergio Leone here, a little &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; there and, uh, martial arts-style confrontations are all deftly melded in &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot;, an attempt to elucidate the French urban legend of the Beast of Gevaudan. This is a home-grown French actioner that wears its sincere desire to entertain on its flamboyantly tailored sleeve&quot;.

The blend of various movie genres, such as martial arts, mystery, costume drama and horror attracted certain amounts of criticism. In particular, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;This new take on horror is more of the bloody same&quot;, whereas Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that it is &quot;a mad agglomeration of styles and traditions that ultimately results in nothing so much as a mad agglomeration of styles and traditions&quot;.

Joan Dupont of &quot;The New York Times&quot; labelled &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; as a &quot;cult&quot; film.

===Box office===
The film was one of the biggest box office hits for 2001 in France, grossing an estimated $24 million. The film also enjoyed commercial success in the United States; Universal Pictures paid $2 million to acquire the film&#x27;s North American distribution rights and went on to gross $11.3 million in limited theatrical release, making it the sixth-highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the United States (behind &quot;Amelie&quot;, &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; and &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; ). The film also did brisk video and DVD sales in the United States. Gans said that the film&#x27;s United States release was a great success. On the other hand, the film was also number one at the Italian box office for two weeks. Overall, the film grossed $70 million in worldwide box office against $29 million production budget.

==Alternate versions==
There are three distinct and very different versions of the film:

* The original French/US theatrical cut, running 143 minutes (sometimes listed as 142 minutes).
* The UK cut, running 139 minutes, released on home video in the UK and Australia; in this version, all the scenes involving the Royal Hunter Beauterne are removed and some scenes from &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; are added in.
* The &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, running 150 minutes (sometimes listed as 152 minutes), released on home video in France and Canada in 2002, and later in the US and other territories.

In the United States, Universal Pictures originally released the 143 minute theatrical cut on DVD &amp; VHS, on 1 October 2002. Focus Features released a two-disc, special-edition DVD containing the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; on 26 August 2008. Shout!

<text>The Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS) is a self-assessed personality questionnaire. It was first introduced in the book &quot;Please Understand Me&quot;. The KTS is closely associated with the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); however, there are significant practical and theoretical differences between the two personality questionnaires and their associated different descriptions.

==Historical development==
:&quot;See also Historical Development of Theories of the Four Temperaments&quot;
David Keirsey became familiar with the work of Ernst Kretschmer and William Sheldon after WWII in the late 1940s. Keirsey developed the Temperament Sorter after being introduced to the MBTI in 1956. Tracing the idea of temperament back to the ancient Greeks, Keirsey developed a modern temperament theory in his books &quot;Please Understand Me&quot; (1978), &quot;Portraits of Temperament&quot; (1988), &quot;Presidential Temperament&quot; (1992), &quot;Please Understand Me II&quot; (1998), &quot;Brains and Careers&quot; (2008), and &quot;Personology&quot; (2010). The table below shows how Myers&#x27; and Keirsey&#x27;s types correspond to other temperament theories or constructs, dating from ancient times to the present day.

==Four temperaments==
Keirsey expanded on the ancient study of temperament by Hippocrates and Plato. In his works, Keirsey used the names suggested by Plato: Artisan (iconic), Guardian (pistic), Idealist (noetic), and Rational (dianoetic). Keirsey divided each of the four temperaments into two categories (roles), each with two types (role variants). The resulting 16 types correlate with the 16 personality types described by Briggs and Myers.

===Artisan===
The Artisan temperament is one of four temperaments defined by Keirsey. Correlating with the SP (sensing–perceiving) Myers-Briggs types, the Artisan temperament comprises the following role variants (listed with their correlating Myers-Briggs types): Composer (ISFP), Crafter (ISTP), Performer (ESFP), and Promoter (ESTP). Artisans are concrete and adaptable. Seeking stimulation and virtuosity, they are concerned with making an impact. Their greatest strength is &quot;tactics&quot;. They excel at troubleshooting, agility, and the manipulation of tools, instruments, and equipment. At their worst, entertainers can become pleasure-seeking, and operators can become hedonistic. The two roles are as follows:
:* Operators are the directive (proactive) Artisans. Their most-developed intelligence operation is &quot;expediting&quot;. The attentive Crafters and the expressive Promoters are the two role variants.
:* Entertainers are the informative (reactive) Artisans. Their most developed intelligence operation is &quot;improvising&quot;. The attentive Composers and the expressive Performers are the two role variants.

===Guardian===
The Guardian temperament is one of four temperaments defined by Keirsey. Correlating with the SJ (sensing–judging) Myers–Briggs types, the Guardian temperament comprises the following role variants (listed with their correlating Myers–Briggs types): Inspector (ISTJ), Protector (ISFJ), Provider (ESFJ), and Supervisor (ESTJ). Guardians are concrete and organized (scheduled). Seeking security and belonging, they are concerned with responsibility and duty. Their greatest strength is &quot;logistics&quot;. They excel at organizing, facilitating, checking, and supporting. The two roles are as follows:

:*Administrators are the directive (proactive) Guardians. Their most developed intelligence operation is &quot;regulating&quot;. The attentive Inspectors and the expressive Supervisors are the two role variants.

:* Conservators are the informative (reactive) Guardians. Their most developed intelligence operation is &quot;supporting&quot;. The attentive Protectors and the expressive Providers are the two role variants.

===Idealist===
The Idealist temperament is one of four temperaments defined by Keirsey. Correlating with the NF (intuitive–feeling) Myers-Briggs types, the Idealist temperament comprises the following role variants (listed with their correlating Myers-Briggs types): Champion (ENFP), Counselor (INFJ), Healer (INFP), and Teacher (ENFJ). Idealists are abstract and compassionate. Seeking meaning and significance, they are concerned with personal growth and finding their own unique identity. Their greatest strength is &quot;diplomacy&quot;. They excel at clarifying, individualizing, unifying, and inspiring. The two roles are as follows:

:* Mentors are the directive (proactive) Idealists. Their most developed intelligence operation is &quot;developing&quot;. The attentive Counselors and the expressive Teachers are the two role variants.

:* Advocates are the informative (reactive) Idealists. Their most developed intelligence operation is &quot;mediating&quot;. The attentive Healers and the expressive Champions are the two role variants.

===Rational===
The Rational temperament is one of the four temperaments defined by Keirsey. Correlating with the NT (intuitive–thinking) Myers-Briggs types, the Rational temperament comprises the following role variants (listed with their correlated Myers-Briggs types): Architect (INTP), Fieldmarshal (ENTJ), Inventor (ENTP), and Mastermind (INTJ). Rationals are abstract and objective. Seeking mastery and self-control, they are concerned with their own knowledge and competence. Their greatest strength is &quot;strategy&quot;. They excel in any kind of logical investigation such as engineering, conceptualizing, theorizing, and coordinating. The two roles are as follows:

:* Coordinators are the directive (proactive) Rationals. Their most developed intelligence operation is &quot;arranging&quot;. The attentive Masterminds and the expressive Fieldmarshals are the two role variants.

:* Engineers are the informative (reactive) Rationals. Their most developed intelligence operation is &quot;constructing&quot;. The attentive Architects and the expressive Inventors are the two role variants.

==Four interaction roles==
In his book &quot;Brains and Careers&quot; (2008), Keirsey divided the role variants into groupings that he called &quot;four differing roles that people play in face-to-face interaction with one another.&quot;

There are two Proactive Enterprising Roles:
*Initiators (expressive and directive): Field Marshal (ENTJ), Supervisor (ESTJ), Promoter (ESTP), Teacher (ENFJ)—Preemptive
*Contenders (attentive and directive): Mastermind (INTJ), Inspector (ISTJ), Crafter (ISTP), Counselor (INFJ)—Competitive
There are two Reactive Inquiring Roles:
*Coworkers (expressive and informative): Inventor (ENTP), Provider (ESFJ), Performer (ESFP), Champion (ENFP)—Collaborative
*Responders (attentive and informative): Architect (INTP), Protector (ISFJ), Composer (ISFP), Healer (INFP)—Accommodative

The roles were implied in the informing/directing factor introduced in &quot;Portraits of Temperament&quot;. In his 2010 follow-up book, &quot;Personology&quot;, &quot;Coworkers&quot; is renamed &quot;Collaborators&quot; and &quot;Responders&quot; is renamed &quot;Accommodators&quot;.

==Temperaments and intelligence types==
The following table shows how the four rings relate to one another and to the various temperaments.

==Myers–Briggs types versus Keirsey&#x27;s temperaments==
The type descriptions of Isabel Myers differ from the character descriptions of David Keirsey in several important ways:
* Myers primarily focused on how people think and feel; Keirsey focused more on behavior, which is directly observable.
* Myers&#x27;s descriptions use a linear four-factor model; Keirsey&#x27;s descriptions use a systems field theory model.
* Myers, following Jung&#x27;s lead, emphasized the extraversion/introversion (expressive/attentive) dichotomy; Keirsey&#x27;s model places greater importance on the sensing/intuition (concrete/abstract) dichotomy.
* Myers grouped types by &#x27;function attitudes&#x27;; Keirsey, by temperament.

Myers grouped types according to cognitive function: the &#x27;thinking type&#x27; grouping for those with dominant thinking; the &#x27;intuitive type&#x27; grouping for those with dominant intuition; the &#x27;feeling type&#x27; grouping for those with dominant feeling; and the &#x27;sensing type&#x27; grouping for those with dominant sensing. Keirsey&#x27;s temperaments correlate with Myers&#x27; combinations of preferences: Guardians with sensing plus judging (SJ); Artisans with sensing plus perceiving (SP); Idealists with intuition plus feeling (NF); and Rationals with intuition plus thinking (NT).

Myers paired ESTJs with ENTJs, ISFPs with INFPs, INTPs with ISTPs, and ENFJs with ESFJs because they share the same dominant function attitude. ESTJs and ENTJs are both extraverted thinkers, ISFPs and INFPs are both introverted feelers, INTPs and ISTPs are both introverted thinkers, and ENFJs and ESFJs are both extraverted feelers. Keirsey holds that these same groupings are very different from one another because they are of different temperaments. ESTJs are Guardians whereas ENTJs are Rationals; ISFPs are Artisans whereas INFPs are Idealists; INTPs are Rationals whereas ISTPs are Artisans; and ENFJs are Idealists whereas ESFJs are Guardians.

==Empirical validation==
In a 2001 peer-reviewed study published in the &quot;Journal of Career Assessment&quot;, data from the Keirsey Temperament Sorter II online instrument and Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) for 203 college freshmen were analyzed and compared. Positive correlations appeared between the concurrent MBTI and Keirsey measures of psychological type, giving preliminary support to the validity of the online version of Keirsey.

<text>Thibaudeau Rinfret (June 22, 1879 – July 25, 1962) was a Canadian jurist who served as the ninth Chief Justice of Canada from 1944 to 1954 and briefly as Administrator of Canada from January to February 1952. He also served as a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada from 1924 to 1944.

==Early life==
Rinfret was born in Montreal in 1879, the son of François-Olivier Rinfret and Albina Pominville. He was the brother of Fernand Rinfret, Liberal politician who became Mayor of Montreal, and brother of Charles Rinfret, a prominent Montreal businessman.

==Professional career==
Rinfret studied law at the Université Laval à Montréal, Faculté de droit and McGill University and was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1901. He was appointed to the Quebec Superior Court in 1922 and to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1924.

Rinfret became Chief Justice on January 8, 1944, and served until his retirement on June 22, 1954. During his term as Chief Justice, Canada ended appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council making the Supreme Court of Canada the final court of appeal in Canadian jurisprudence.

Rinfret was Administrator of the Government in 1952 after the departure of Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis, and until Vincent Massey could officially be sworn in as Governor General of Canada. During this time he proclaimed Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada, following the death of King George VI.

<doc id="1031299" wikidata="Q2320111" url="?curid=1031299" title="Vampire Killer">
<text>Vampire Killer, known in Japan as is a 1986 platform game developed and published by Konami for the MSX2. It is a parallel version of the original &quot;Castlevania&quot;, which debuted a month earlier for the Famicom Disk System under the same Japanese title. However, the MSX2 version was localized first in Europe and was published without the &quot;Castlevania&quot; branding that the franchise would start using abroad in 1987 when the NES version was released in North America (where neither &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; nor the MSX2 platform were released). It was released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console on December 17, 2014, in Japan.

Like in &quot;Castlevania&quot;, the player controls vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who ventures into Dracula&#x27;s castle armed with a mystical whip inherited from his father, in order to slay the evil count.

==Gameplay==
While &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; shares the same premise, soundtrack, characters and locations as the original &quot;Castlevania&quot;, the structure of the game and its play mechanics differ significantly from its NES counterpart. Like &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; consists of 18 stages, with a boss encounter at the end of every third stage. But in contrast to the linear level designs in &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; features more labyrinth-like stages, requiring the player to seek out the exit to the next stage and find the skeleton key required to unlock it. Due to the hardware limitations of the MSX2, &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; uses flip screens instead of scrolling. The game can be played with a keyboard or a game controller.

Items and weapons can be obtained by breaking through candle stands and certain walls like in the NES version, and by purchasing them from merchants hidden throughout the castle or by unlocking treasure chests using keys. Simon&#x27;s default whip can be replaced with one of four weapons: a chain whip, throwing daggers, a battle ax, and a battle cross - the latter two function both like a boomerang and must be retrieved on their return path if the player wishes to preserve them.

There are four items that Simon can carry with him similar to the sub-weapons in the NES version: a map which shows his current position and the location of the exit (can only be used three times), holy water, an hourglass (which temporarily paralyzes all enemies) and one of two types of shields. Heart points are used as ammunition for the holy water and hourglass and as currency for merchants.

There are other items that provide passive effects such as increasing or decreasing Simon&#x27;s intelligence (which affects the prices of items sold by merchants), temporary invulnerability, increased speed, higher jumps, and health recovery. After defeating a boss, Simon will start the next stage without any of his previously accumulated equipment, aside from the number of hearts and the map.

The player starts the game with three lives and with no way to gain extra lives. There are no continues, unless the game is played with the Game Master cartridge in the second slot. Playing with the Game Master enables the option to select the stage and the number of lives to start with, as well as the ability to skip screens.

==Reception==
Time Extension placed &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; fourth last on its list of ranked &quot;Castlevania&quot; games. It was described that it &quot;is a rather unusual attempt to expand the original game in new and interesting ways, and proves that right from the beginning, Konami was clearly aware that &quot;Castlevania&quot; was a franchise which could easily evolve beyond its action-platforming origins. The problem is that this attempt to create a sort of action-RPG hybrid is badly undone by its non-linear structure (which involves searching looping levels in order to find keys) and the MSX2&#x27;s infamous inability to handle smooth scrolling – screens &#x27;flip&#x27; from one to the other when you reach the edge of a room. It&#x27;s an interesting historical footnote, but beyond that, &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; isn&#x27;t worth the eye-watering price the original version now changes hands for.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Released the same year as the linear &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; is open-ended metroidvania format of later entries in the &quot;Castlevania&quot; franchise.

<doc id="1031302" wikidata="Q6993696" url="?curid=1031302" title="Neoplan Transliner (North America)">
<text>The Neoplan Transliner was a series of related public transport single-decker bus models introduced by Neoplan USA in 1981 and produced until the company declared bankruptcy in 2006. It was available in various lengths ranging from to articulated (nominal lengths), and was marketed against the Rapid Transit Series, Flxible Metro, Gillig Phantom, New Flyer High Floor, and Orion I.

== Models ==
The Neoplan USA Transliner was available in a wide variety of body styles. Transliner could be ordered in 26&#x27;, 30&#x27;, 35&#x27;, 40&#x27;, and 60&#x27; lengths. Standard (high), completely low, or semi-low (with steps to access the rear section after the rear doors) floors were available.

An unrelated over-the-road coach was marketed by Neoplan GmbH starting in the 1990s for the European market, also named Transliner.

;Notes
Originally, the Transliner could only be ordered in standard (high) floor form. The low-floor variants were introduced in 1999, with Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT) being the lead agency for mass-produced examples. The &quot;true low floor&quot; variants (AN440TLF and AN445TLF) were also known as Intraliners, available in nominal lengths and mostly used by airports.

Unique variants included the AN440LF-ETB trolleybuses produced for Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), featuring a third passenger door on the street (driver&#x27;s) side, the DMA-460LF dual-mode buses for the Silver Line (MBTA) with trolley poles and a diesel engine, the AN440/3 3-axle variant with a dead third axle for Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), and the shortened AN460RC (aka AN459) built for New Jersey Transit (NJT).
=== Design ===
;Notes
==== Construction ====
Self-supporting monocoque steel construction made of seamless square steel tubes, electrically welded. Exterior roof and side wall panels are of double galvanized steel, sealed to the skeleton with a combination of spot welding and gluing. Stainless steel wheelhousings and stepwells.

==== Seating ====
Depending on the model and length, seats were offered for up to 37 (AN440LF), 43 (AN440), or 65 passengers (AN460/AN460LF).

==== Engines ====

NeoPlan offered a variety of engines, both diesel and CNG fueled. Depending upon the model, Detroit Diesel Series 40, 50, or the 6V92TA; Cummins ISM, C-series, or ISL; or CAT C-9 engines could also be had. Most Transliners featured Allison B400 or B500 &quot;World Transmissions&quot;. However, ZF (4HP590) and Voith transmissions were also available on some models.

== History ==
The first transit buses sold by Neoplan USA were based on the buses developed for VöV under the Standard-Linienbus program. Accordingly, the first buses ordered from Neoplan USA were called the Atlantis and internally N-416-&quot;xx&quot; (with &quot;xx&quot; designating nominal length in feet); these were purchased by Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA, 50× 40-foot models) and Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS, 26× 40-foot and 18× 35-foot models) and delivered in 1981 and 1982.

Neoplan USA was also offering the &quot;Advanced Design&quot; N412 bus to compete with the GM Rapid Transit Series and Flxible Metro. By 1982, these buses had been given the name &quot;Transliner&quot; and the model numbers had been established as the AN435 and AN440 (for American Neoplan, Model 4, 35 or 40-foot lengths, respectively). Significant early Transliner sales included 1,000 buses to 16 transit agencies in the state of Pennsylvania, coordinated by PennDOT in 1982, which was the largest single bus contract in the U.S. to date, 50 articulated buses to MARTA, 76 buses to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) in 1983, 60 buses to AC Transit, and 415 buses to LACMTA, then operating as the Southern California Rapid Transit District (SCRTD), in 1984 to support crowds expected for the 1984 Summer Olympics.

Pennsylvania won a commitment from Neoplan USA to build an assembly plant in the state as a condition to fulfill the order; Neoplan USA announced its intent to add a Pennsylvania factory in 1982 and revealed a scale model of the site chosen in Honey Brook in 1984, but assembled all of the Pennliners in Lamar due to the delivery deadlines. The first bus completed for PAT, #3500, has been preserved by the Antique Motor Coach Association of Pennsylvania since March 2000. Although the Honey Brook site assembled buses briefly in 1986, it would later become the headquarters of Neopart, Neoplan USA&#x27;s part distribution operation. A third Neoplan USA factory operated for approximately a year from June 2001 to June 2002 in Brownsville, Texas.

===Issues===
Joseph Alexander, a member of the WMATA board, criticized the 1983 contract award to Neoplan USA; Alexander was also serving as the president of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), which had received negative feedback from MCTS. One MCTS official called Neoplan USA &quot;totally disorganized&quot; and lacking quality control. Cracks were discovered in the frames of WMATA and SCRTD buses in 1984, and those agencies suspended service with their Neoplan USA buses in 1985, just ahead of a nationwide voluntary recall in March. That recall was also driven by a December 1984 incident where a faulty defroster on a WMATA bus led to an electrical fire and subsequent evacuation.

The PennDOT buses, nicknamed &quot;Pennliners&quot;, also were prone to premature corrosion, as experienced by the Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT). Extensive corrosion issues led to a $1.7 million settlement between Neoplan USA and PAT in 1990.

Another PAT order for low-floor AN440LF buses, which were delivered starting in August 1999, were pulled from service by September 2000 for frame cracks. During federally mandated STURAA testing in 1994–95, a prototype AN440LF experienced extensive frame and suspension cracking. Neoplan USA entered an agreement to pay for all frame repairs to the low-floor models. Multiple AN440LF buses delivered to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in 2005 were damaged by the same pothole; traveling over the pothole cracked the torque rods connecting the suspension and steering, and two crashes occurred as a direct consequence of steering issues. Additional cracks in suspension components were discovered in 2006 and 2007.

== Deployment ==
The 40-foot buses were made for over 50 transportation networks all over the United States. The bus networks that have or have had them in service include MBTA in Boston, SEPTA in Philadelphia, WMATA in Washington, D.C., ABQ RIDE in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and LACMTA in Los Angeles.

===Pennsylvania===
In late 1983 through 1985, Neoplan USA delivered the order for over 1,000 &quot;Pennliner&quot; buses for the Pennsylvania. The 1982 contract was a pooled purchase from 16 different transit agencies, with the majority going to SEPTA in Philadelphia (450) and Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT) in Pittsburgh (410).

====Philadelphia====
By 1989, SEPTA, the largest transportation network in Pennsylvania, had purchased a cumulative total of 1,092 Neoplan AN435 and AN440 buses. As they aged, they were replaced by American Ikarus and New Flyer Low Floor buses that entered service between 1996 and 2005. The remaining 35 Neoplan AN440s (EZ models) were sent to the SEPTA Frankford Depot to temporarily replace the 1979 AM General Trolleybuses that were retired in 2004; the AN440s in turn were retired on June 20, 2008, after the final delivery of the replacement New Flyer E40LFR trolleybuses.

SEPTA also ordered 155 Neoplan AN460s from 1998–2000 to replace their aging Volvo B10M articulated buses and about 60 AN460 high floor buses were in service until 2017, when they were replaced by Novabus LFS Artic articulated buses.

====Pittsburgh====
PAT received its first Pennliners in October 1982; the agency later ordered AN460s (articulated) and AN440LFs (low-floor) versions from Neoplan USA.

PAT retired its last two Neoplan buses (AN460s) in December 2019 by providing free rides around downtown Pittsburgh for one weekend.

===Washington, D.C.===
In the 1980s, both PAT and WMATA, also known as Metro, discovered frame cracking issues with their Neoplan USA buses. However, they both later operated additional Neoplan buses, with WMATA ordering the AN460, a 60-foot articulated version.

===San Francisco===
AN440 and AN460 models were ordered by the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) to replace their aging bus fleet and delivered starting in 2001, but they proved troublesome. Among the problems were insufficient, excessively noisy cooling fans (sounds reached up to 90 dB), faulty transmissions, maintenance intensive brake systems (requiring service every ), and cracking frames. The problems were compounded when Neoplan eventually refused to fix the problems, instead choosing to repossess the remaining spare parts and abruptly abandon its San Francisco overhaul yard in September 2005.

The Muni Neoplan USA buses are unique in that they have rear windows, with the air conditioning unit mounted on the roof.

===St. Louis===
Bi-State Development Agency, dba Metro, has a small fleet of Neoplan Buses for its MetroBus service, and since March 30, 2009, has retired them.

<doc id="1031307" wikidata="Q6771591" url="?curid=1031307" title="Marlag und Milag Nord">
<text>Marlag und Milag Nord was a Second World War German prisoner-of-war camp complex for men of the British and Canadian Merchant Navy and Royal Navy. It was located around the village of Westertimke, about north-east of Bremen, though in some sources the camp&#x27;s location is given as Tarmstedt, a larger village about to the west. There were also American merchant seamen detained here as well as some U.S. Navy personnel.

==Status of merchant seamen==
Of more than 5,000 Allied merchant seamen captured by the Germans during the war, most were held at &quot;Marlag-Milag&quot;. As civilian non-combatants, according to Section XI, Article 6, of the 1907 Hague Conventions, merchant seamen &quot;...are not made prisoners of war, on condition that they make a formal promise in writing, not to undertake, while hostilities last, any service connected with the operations of the war.&quot; The Germans, however, always treated Merchant Navy seamen as POWs (as did the British from 1942). In 1943 the Germans suggested an exchange of equal numbers of Merchant Navy prisoners, but this offer was refused by the First Lord of the Admiralty A. V. Alexander on the grounds it would be more to Germany&#x27;s benefit, as it would provide them with a large number of men suitable to be used as U-boat crews, of which they were desperately short.

==Camp history==

===Stalag X-B===
Initially, prisoners from the Merchant and Royal Navy were confined in several camps in Northern Germany. In April 1941 they were gathered together at Stalag X-B at Sandbostel and housed in two compounds designated &quot;Ilag X-B&quot; (Internierungslager&quot;, &quot;Internment camp&quot;) and &quot;Marlag X-B&quot; (Marinelager&quot;, &quot;Navy camp&quot;). At the instigation of the U.S. and Swiss governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross put pressure on the German government not to keep civilian non-combatants in a POW camp. The Germans complied, selecting what was originally a small &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; training camp consisting of six barracks and a small airfield at Westertimke. In July 1941 the prisoners of &quot;Ilag X-B&quot; were set to work dismantling their barrack huts at Sandbostel, then rebuilding them at Westertimke, finally completing the &quot;Milag&quot; camp in February 1942. &quot;Marlag&quot; camp was not completed until July 1942.

===Marlag and Milag Nord===
&quot;Marlag&quot;, the Royal Navy camp, was divided into two compounds; &quot;O&quot; housed officers and their orderlies, while &quot;M&quot; held petty officers and ratings. The majority of prisoners were British, but there were also small numbers of other Allied nationalities. In late 1942 all the ratings were sent to Stalag VIII-B at Lamsdorf and assigned to &quot;Arbeitskommando&quot; (&quot;Work details&quot;), and &quot;M&quot; housed only NCOs.

&quot;Milag&quot; (&quot;Marineinterniertenlager&quot;, &quot;Marine internment camp&quot;), the Merchant Navy camp, was to the east of &quot;Marlag&quot;. This also divided into two separate compounds for officers and men. The area in between contained the guard house, a prison block, fuel bunker, and the camp hospital.

Just outside the gates of &quot;Milag&quot; was the &quot;Kommandantur&quot; (&quot;Headquarters&quot;) and accommodation for the guards. In between the camps there was a large shower block which was used by men of both camps.

Each camp contained a number of single-story wooden huts; 29 in &quot;Marlag&quot; and 36 in &quot;Milag&quot;. Most of them were barracks, while the others contained kitchens, dining rooms, washrooms, guard barracks, storehouses, a post office and other administrative buildings. The barracks were divided into rooms each accommodating 14 to 18 men who slept in two and three-tiered bunks.

The POWs occupied themselves in various ways. There was a camp theatre in &quot;Marlag&quot; and the POWs performed concerts and plays. Each camp had its own sports field and there was also a library with around 3,000 books. Prisoners ran courses in languages and mathematics, as well as commercial, vocational, economic and scientific subjects. Sports equipment and textbooks were obtained from the Red Cross and YMCA. POWs were allowed to send two letters and four postcards each month. There were no restrictions on the number of letters a POW could receive. Naturally all incoming and outgoing mail was censored. A popular diversion was provided by the &quot;Milag Jockey Club&quot; which held race meetings every Saturday evening. The &quot;horses&quot; were wooden models that raced on a track, controlled by dice. The POW bet on the races, and money was raised and donated to the Red Cross.

Under normal conditions the camps had a capacity of 5,300. According to official figures in April 1944 there were 4,268 men held there. Initially the camp was guarded by Naval troops. Later they were replaced by Army reservists.

===Other camps===
The &quot;German Navy&quot; also operated a Dulag (&quot;Durchgangslager&quot;, &quot;Transit camp&quot;) in Wilhelmshaven, where newly arrived prisoners were processed before being sent to other camps. After the Allied bombing raids on Wilhelmshaven in February 1942 this facility was moved to Westertimke. The camp Dulag Nord was located between &quot;Marlag&quot; and &quot;Milag&quot;.

In September 1943, 630 merchant seamen from India, China, Burma and Aden were moved out of the &quot;Milag&quot; into a new camp, Milag (Inder) (known as the &quot;Inderlager&quot; or &quot;Indian Camp&quot;) west of Westertimke. To the north and east of the village three smaller camps were also built. The &quot;Kommandatur&quot; contained the headquarters and administration buildings, while the &quot;Stabslager&quot; and the &quot;Wache&quot; contained accommodation for the administrative personnel and the camp guards.

===Liberation===
At the end of 1944 prisoners evacuated from other camps began to arrive, resulting in overcrowding, and a reduction in food rations. On 4 February 1945 some 3,000 men evacuated from Stalag Luft III arrived at &quot;Marlag-Milag&quot;. In order to accommodate them the entire population of &quot;Marlag&quot; &quot;M&quot; were moved into &quot;O&quot;.

On 2 April 1945 the Commandant announced that he had received orders to leave the camp with most of his guards, leaving only a small detachment behind to hand over the camp to Allied forces, who were already in Bremen. However that afternoon a detachment of over a hundred &quot;SS-Feldgendarmerie&quot; entered the camp, mustered over 3,000 men and marched them out, heading east. The next day, at around at 10.00 a.m., the column was strafed by RAF aircraft, and several POWs were killed. Over the next few days the column was attacked from the air several times. Finally the Senior British Naval Officer offered the Germans the POWs parole, in return for being allowed to rest during the day and march at night. The Germans agreed.

On 9 April 1945 the guards at &quot;Milag-Marlag&quot; moved out and were replaced by older men, presumably local &quot;Volkssturm&quot;. Meanwhile, the column slowly headed east, finally crossing the River Elbe, north of Hamburg, on 18 April.

On 19 April units of the 15th Panzergrenadier Division positioned tanks and artillery next to the camps. The remaining prisoners responded to the threat of a pitched battle on their doorstep by digging slit trenches. The artillery fired from the positions next to the camps, but fortunately had moved away by the time the British Guards Armoured Division liberated the camps on 27 April 1945.

The next day, 28 April, the column finally arrived at Lübeck on the Baltic coast. They were liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 1 May 1945.

===Post-war use===
After the German surrender &quot;Marlag-Milag&quot; was used by the British occupation authorities to house German prisoners-of-war. &quot;Marlag&quot; &quot;O&quot; was designated Civil Internment Camp No. 9 and housed high-ranking party officials and suspected war criminals. In 1946 &quot;Marlag&quot; &quot;M&quot; was used as a location to film Basil Dearden&#x27;s POW drama &quot;The Captive Heart&quot;.&quot;

Between 1952 and 1961 &quot;Milag&quot; was used as accommodation centre for female refugees from East Germany. The northern part of &quot;Milag&quot; was eventually built over with new housing, while the southern half is now heavily wooded.

The &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; took over the site of &quot;Marlag&quot;, and from March 1963 as the &quot;Timke-Kaserne&quot; (&quot;Timke Barracks&quot;) it was the headquarters of the &quot;Flugabwehrraketenbataillon 31&quot; (&quot;31st Anti-aircraft Missile Battalion&quot;) of the 4th Luftwaffe Division, operating the MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile. They finally left the site in 1993, since when it has been redeveloped as a business park.

==Escapes==
Several escape tunnels were dug from &quot;Milag&quot;. The first was about long, built from March to August 1943. Twelve prisoners escaped, though all were recaptured within two weeks. A second tunnel, about long, was built from April to August 1944. Five men escaped, but again were soon recaptured. Another tunnel built by Norwegian prisoners was discovered before its completion. In addition, another tunnel was dug to store contraband.

Two officers; Lieutenant Denis Kelleher RNVR, and Lieutenant Stewart Campbell, FAA, escaped from &quot;Marlag&quot; in early 1944, wearing blue overalls to cover their uniforms, and managed to reach Britain within 22 days, having been smuggled to neutral Sweden on a ship from Bremen.

Another successful escaper from &quot;Marlag&quot; was Lieutenant David James, RNVR. In December 1943 James slipped out of the shower block, but was arrested at the port of Lübeck. In late 1944 he escaped again and this time made it to Sweden.

==Notable prisoners==
* Lieutenant David Hunter RM, captured at Calais in May 1940, he twice escaped from &quot;Marlag X-B&quot; at Sandbostel, and ended the war at Colditz.
* Lieutenant Ivan Ewart RNVR, captured in January 1942 after his MTB was sunk off Boulogne. After two escape attempts from &quot;Milag-Marlag&quot;, he was transferred to Colditz.
* Captain Micky Burn, No. 2 Commando, captured in March 1942 after the St Nazaire Raid.

* Leslie McDermott-Brown (1925-1993), a merchant marine cadet, was the UK&#x27;s youngest POW in 1940, captured age 15 after his ship the SS Kemmendine, which had sailed from the Clyde, was sunk by the German surface raider The Atlantis in the Bay of Biscay. Leslie spent the next five years in captivity in Germany, aged 15-20, finally being liberated from Milag Nord in 1945. Despite this set-back in life, Leslie went on to be a managing director of hotel company in Plymouth Devon during the 1950s to 1980s and is survived by his three sons.

<text>Margaret Grace Denig (born September 21, 1983) is an American actress. She is known for playing Shannon Rutherford on the ABC television series &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2006; 2010), Kim Mills in the &quot;Taken&quot; trilogy (2008–2014), Irina in &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot; (2011–2012), and Althea Szewczyk-Przygocki in &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot; (2018–2021).

Grace earned a Young Artist Award nomination in 2002 with her portrayal of 15-year-old murder victim Martha Moxley in the television movie &quot;Murder in Greenwich&quot;. In 2004, she was cast as Shannon Rutherford in the television series &quot;Lost&quot;, on which she was a main cast member for the first two seasons, winning a Screen Actors Guild Award shared with the ensemble cast. Leaving the series, Grace was keen to work more prominently in film. She appeared in &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot; (2007), and opposite Liam Neeson as Kim Mills in &quot;Taken&quot; in 2008. She reprised the role of Kim in &quot;Taken 2&quot; (2012) and &quot;Taken 3&quot; (2014).

She played the lead role, Alice, in &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot;, a modern take on Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Grace reprised the role of Shannon in two more episodes of &quot;Lost&quot;, including the series finale. In 2013, she appeared in the sixth season of &quot;Californication&quot; as Faith, a groupie and a muse to the stars, who captures the eye of Hank Moody, played by David Duchovny. In 2018 she joined the cast of the series &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot; as journalist Althea Szewczyk-Przygocki.

==Early life==
Margaret Grace Denig was born in Worthington, Ohio, to Valinn (&quot;née&quot; Everett) and Fred Denig, who ran a family jewelry business. She attended Worthington Christian Schools from kindergarten through ninth grade and briefly attended Thomas Worthington High School, where she began acting in school plays and community theater, including a 2000 Gallery Players production of &quot;The Crucible&quot;, at a local Jewish Community Center. As a child, Grace was a voracious reader and a self-described &quot;Shakespeare nerd&quot; telling the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that at age 13, she &quot;was really into Jane Austen, kind of like how some kids are into &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;.

==Career==
Grace acquired an agent within a week of relocating to Los Angeles and enrolled in acting classes. She landed her first role in &quot;Rachel&#x27;s Room&quot;, a 2001 web-based video series about the affairs inside a teenage girl&#x27;s bedroom that was created by &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; executive producer Paul Stupin. Her next role was on the 2002 television series &quot;Septuplets&quot;, which was cancelled before the first episode had aired. Her breakout role was on 2002&#x27;s television movie &quot;Murder in Greenwich&quot;, based on the true story of 15-year-old Martha Moxley&#x27;s murder. She was nominated for a Young Artist Award for her portrayal of Moxley in the Best Performance in a TV Movie, Miniseries or Special – Leading Young Actress category, but lost to Clara Bryant for &quot;Tru Confessions&quot;. She went on to feature in minor roles on the television series &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Lyon&#x27;s Den&quot;, &quot;Miracles&quot;, &quot;Like Family&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and the films &quot;Twelve Mile Road&quot; and &quot;Creature Unknown&quot;.
In mid-2004, Grace&#x27;s agent sent her the script for the pilot episode of &quot;Lost&quot;; she was given the role of Shannon Rutherford after a successful audition. She was nominated in 2005 for a Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Breakout Performance – Female for her role on &quot;Lost&quot;, but lost to &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;″ Eva Longoria. She lived in Hawaii during the filming of the show&#x27;s first season, and signed on to star opposite Tom Welling in &quot;The Fog&quot;, a 2005 remake of the 1980 horror film of the same name, as a character originally played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Though the filming of &quot;Lost&quot; was supposed to have ended before &quot;The Fog&quot; began, the productions coincided due to &quot;Lost&quot;″s extended season finale and Grace flew between the two sets, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu and on Bowen Island in British Columbia.

After ranking at #27 on &quot;Maxim&quot;″s Hot 100 list of 2005, she returned for &quot;Lost&quot;″s second season. Her character was killed in the season&#x27;s eighth episode, &quot;Collision&quot;, when the series&#x27; writers began to feel that the character&#x27;s &quot;story avenues [were] limited&quot;. Executive producer Carlton Cuse said that Grace&#x27;s departure from the show was &quot;sort of a win-win&quot; as she was eager to enter a full-time career in film. After leaving the series, she nevertheless joined the other principal &quot;Lost&quot; cast members of season 2 onstage at the 12th Screen Actors Guild Awards where &quot;Lost&quot; won the award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

&quot;Variety&quot; reported in May 2005 that Grace was in negotiations to play X-Men character Kitty Pryde in the 2006 film &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, but in July, auditions were reportedly being held for her replacement. The role ultimately went to Elliot Page, and Grace later revealed that she had never been contacted about the role and was surprised to read that she was up for the part in question. Grace&#x27;s next role was in the 2007 independent film &quot;Suburban Girl&quot;, alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alec Baldwin. In 2007, she starred in &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot;, based on Karen Joy Fowler&#x27;s novel of the same name. She is a fan of Jane Austen and had read Fowler&#x27;s novel when it was released in 2004. When she was given the film&#x27;s script, she met with the director Robin Swicord, with whom she says she &quot;geeked out&quot;, and was given the role of Allegra, an openly lesbian 20-year-old.

After the filming of &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot; was completed, Grace briefly returned to Hawaii to shoot a guest spot on the &quot;Lost&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Exposé&quot;. She starred in the 2008 thriller film &quot;Taken&quot; with Liam Neeson, who was at the top of a list of male actors Grace wished to work with that she had written just two months before she was cast. She played the lead in Simon Fellows&#x27; 2009 &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot;, a modern adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. In 2010, Grace starred in the drama &quot;Flying Lessons&quot;, and appeared opposite Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in James Mangold&#x27;s film &quot;Knight and Day&quot;, as well as in &quot;Faster&quot;, with Dwayne Johnson. Grace&#x27;s busy schedule prevented her from returning as Shannon in &quot;LA X&quot;, the season premiere for &quot;Lost&quot;&#x27;s sixth and final season, but she did return for the series finale &quot;The End&quot;. In September 2010, it was revealed that Grace was chosen to play Irina in &quot;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;.

In December 2012, it was announced Grace would be making her Broadway debut in &quot;Picnic&quot;. The play opened for previews on December 14, running at the American Airlines Theatre. Sebastian Stan co-stars with Grace in the Pulitzer Prize winning play.

She also made her first appearance as a guest star in the Showtime Series &quot;Californication&quot; in January 2013, in which she plays a groupie and to the rock and roll world as well as the personal interest of Hank Moody, starring David Duchovny, with her role of Althea Szewczyk-Przygocki on Fear the Walking Dead&quot; coming five years later.

=== Other projects ===
Grace has been on the covers of many international fashion magazines, including &quot;Saturday Night, Femme Fatales, Vanidades, 7x7&quot; and &quot;Organic Spa Magazine&quot;; Canada&#x27;s &quot;Glow&quot; and &quot;Viva;&quot; UK&#x27;s &quot;CosmoGirl;&quot; Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Caras&quot;; France&#x27;s &quot;Télé 7 Jours&quot;; Singapore&#x27;s &quot;Solitaire&quot; and Russia&#x27;s &quot;Cosmopolitan Beauty.&quot;

==Personal life==
While still working on &quot;Lost,&quot; Grace and Ian Somerhalder adopted a feral cat named Roo which they found &quot;literally dying&quot; in the jungle on the set. She said that the cat is now her &quot;travel buddy.&quot; In February 2017, Grace became engaged to Brent Bushnell, the CEO of an entertainment company. They were married on May 28, 2017. The couple&#x27;s first child, a son, was born in 2020.

Grace often credits her mother as her source of inspiration. When asked about her closest friend, she said that she and her mother were more like sisters and that she is &quot;lucky to have an exceptionally cool mom.&quot; She is a self-proclaimed Anglophile, having written to a pen pal in the Lake District from the age of eight, and admiring a number of English poets, including William Shakespeare; she first visited England when she was thirteen. She calls herself very clumsy, claiming to &quot;trip over my legs all the time,&quot; and was jokingly nicknamed &quot;Maggie Graceless&quot; by one of her former cast-mates.

<text>Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry is a documentary film on U.S. Senator John Kerry&#x27;s military service during the Vietnam War and his subsequent participation in the peace movement. There is significant emphasis on Kerry&#x27;s famous speech before a Senate committee, historical footage from the Winter Soldier Investigations, and coverage of the Dewey Canyon III anti-war demonstrations in Washington, D.C. The majority of the film is composed of archival footage, with much of it in the original black-and-white format.

From the producer&#x27;s website:This is a feature length documentary about character and moral leadership during a time of national crisis. Loosely based on the bestselling book &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; by Douglas Brinkley, &quot;Going Upriver&quot; examines the story of John Kerry and the key events that made him a national figure and the man he is today.

Going Upriver director George Butler (best known for his highly acclaimed films &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and &quot;The Endurance: Shackleton&#x27;s Legendary Antarctic Expedition&quot;) first realized Kerry’s importance to his generation and began documenting his journey in photographs in 1969, covering Kerry&#x27;s leadership of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), his early political campaigns, as well as intimate moments of his personal life. The film weaves together Butler’s extraordinary photographs with archival film, interviews with Kerry’s closest associates, and more contemporary images of the Senator at home and abroad.&quot;Going Upriver&quot; is the culmination of a forty-year friendship between Kerry and George Butler. They first met in 1964 while Butler was a reporter and photographer, and published a book together (&quot;The New Soldier&quot;, about Vietnam veterans and the anti-war Movement) in 1971. Butler has documented Kerry&#x27;s political career with thousands of photographs, and Kerry is godfather to one of Butler&#x27;s sons. Butler builds a portrait of Kerry through conversations with the men who served with him, people who went to college with him, and relatives. He narrows the story to Vietnam, and uses vintage footage to show the duty to which Kerry asked to be transferred. The recollections from his shipmates, and shots of battle and battle damage on his and other swift boats, underscores the nature of the duty and Kerry&#x27;s performance of it.

The video of his TV appearances and congressional testimony when he got back provides the context to Kerry&#x27;s change of heart on the war and his determination to see to it that his comrades stopped dying over there. Considerable attention is paid to the lesser known activities and details behind some of that era&#x27;s most tumultuous events, such as the occupying of the Washington Mall despite court injunctions and the two marches to the Arlington National Cemetery. Descriptive narrative often gives way to the more powerful messages conveyed by the expressions and actions of participants caught on film at these events. Some of the footage shot in Vietnam could be considered mildly graphic.

&quot;Going Upriver&quot; was first pre-released at the Toronto International Film Festival under the &quot;Real to Reel&quot; documentary category on September 9 through September 18, 2004.

<text>The Detroit Diesel Series 50 is an inline four-cylinder diesel engine, that was introduced in 1993 by Detroit Diesel. The Series 50 was developed from the existing block of its sister engine, the [[Detroit Diesel 60|Series 60]], which itself was initially designed by Detroit Diesel. The cylinder heads were cast by John Deere at one time.

==History==
The Series 50 engine is used as a major bus engine in North America, especially from buses built in the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s. The power plant was offered for several applications: trucks, buses, motor homes, construction and industrial equipment, and military vehicles. It is unusual to find an inline four-cylinder engine propelling heavy duty buses, which traditionally use inline six, V-6 or V-8 diesel engines.

In 2000, in order to better respond to more stringent EPA emissions standards, Detroit Diesel announced revisions of the Series 50 for diesel applications. The changes included the addition of an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, and a variable geometry turbocharger system to improve torque. 

In September 2004, Detroit Diesel ceased production of the Series 50 heavy duty diesel engine for on highway applications due to emissions standards. It is still available for off-road applications. A replacement was scheduled to take place in 2007, then was pushed back until 2009. According to Detroit Diesel, Series 50 engines will no longer be produced for non-Daimler AG trucks or buses beginning in 2010.

===Alternative fuels===
In addition to being powered by diesel fuel, the engine can also use alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquified natural gas (LNG) under the Series 50G label. Several thousand Series 50 propelled buses are now on the streets of major cities such as New York City and Los Angeles.

<text>The Quebec Citadelles (French: Citadelles de Québec) were a Minor ice hockey team in the American Hockey League. They played in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada at the Colisée Pepsi. The name refers to the Citadelle of Quebec, a landmark fortification in that city since the late 17th century.

The Citadelles were a minor-league feeder team that developed players for the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens organization. This AHL team was established in 1999 to much fanfare, and played with good fan support (and some success) for three seasons, before being relocated and merged into the Hamilton Bulldogs.

==History==

One of the team&#x27;s most striking features was its choice of a mascot and emblem. The team&#x27;s sweaters were emblazoned with an iconically depicted goat&#x27;s head, representing the goat mascot of the Royal 22e Régiment (The Van Doos) stationed in the Citadel of Quebec. By tradition, this goat is always named &#x27;Batisse&#x27;. The regiment&#x27;s goat is a descendant of one presented to the unit by Queen Elizabeth II in 1955 (which, in turn, was the descendant of a goat given to Queen Victoria from the Shah of Iran in 1844).

:The franchise was previously known as: Fredericton Canadiens (1990–1999).
:The market was previously served by: Quebec Rafales of the IHL (1996–1998).
:The market is currently served by: Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (1997–present).
:The franchise was merged with the: Hamilton Bulldogs (co-owned with the Edmonton Oilers organization in 2002, and wholly operated by the Montreal Canadiens from 2003–2015).

<doc id="1031332" wikidata="Q987438" url="?curid=1031332" title="Eagles (album)">
<text>Eagles is the debut studio album by American rock band the Eagles. The album was recorded at London&#x27;s Olympic Studios with producer Glyn Johns and released on June 1, 1972, by Asylum Records. It was an immediate success for the then-new band, reaching No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and achieving a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three singles were released from the album, each reaching the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;Take It Easy&quot; (number 12), &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; (number 9), and &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot; (number 22). The band, starting with this album, played a major role in popularizing the country rock sound.

The album was ranked number 368 in the 2012 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and at number 207 in the 2020 reboot of the list. The single &quot;Take It Easy&quot; is part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

==Background==
In 1971, the band had just been formed and signed by David Geffen, who then sent them to Aspen, Colorado, to develop as a band. For their first album, Glenn Frey wanted Glyn Johns to be the producer as they liked a number of rock albums engineered by Johns, including albums by the Rolling Stones, the Who, and Led Zeppelin. Johns was invited by Geffen to see the band perform at a club called Tulagi in Boulder, Colorado, in December 1971. Johns, however, was not impressed by the band&#x27;s live performance, thinking that it sounded confused and lacking in cohesionFrey wanted it to be a rock &amp; roll band while Bernie Leadon wanted a country feelso Johns declined to produce the album.

Johns was persuaded by Geffen to have a second listen in a rehearsal setting in Los Angeles, but Johns did not change his opinion of the band until all four started singing harmonies with acoustic guitar on a ballad written by bassist Randy Meisner, &quot;Take the Devil&quot;. Johns was impressed by their harmony singing, and later said: &quot;There it was, the sound. Extraordinary blend of voices, wonderful harmony sound, just stunning.&quot; In the albums he produced for the Eagles, Johns emphasized the vocal blend of the band, and he has been credited with shaping the band into &quot;the country-rock band with those high-flyin&#x27; harmonies.&quot;

==Recording==
The band went to London, where they spent two weeks recording the album at the Olympic Studios. The album cost $125,000 to produce. Johns tried to introduce a more acoustic sound in the recording, and concentrated on the vocal blend and arrangements. There were however frequent disagreements over the sound of the band between the producer and Frey and Don Henley during the making of the album. Frey and Henley wanted a rougher rock and roll sound, while Johns was interested in using Bernie Leadon&#x27;s banjo and Randy Meisner&#x27;s bass to create a more country sound. Frey later admitted, &quot;[Johns] was the key to our success in a lot of ways&quot;, but added: &quot;We just didn’t want to make another limp-wristed L.A. country-rock record.&quot; Johns also instituted a no-drug and no-alcohol rule that Frey, but not Henley, was unhappy about.

Three of the songs recorded in London feature Frey on lead vocals, another three with Meisner and two with Leadon. The chirping sound at the start of the song by Leadon and Meisner, &quot;Earlybird&quot;, was taken from a sound effect library. On &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, Johns convinced Leadon to play double-time banjo on the song, a touch that Johns felt made the song different.

Originally, Henley co-wrote and sang one song on the album, &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;. Later, a further track, &quot;Nightingale&quot;, was recorded in Los Angeles after Geffen and manager Elliot Roberts listened to the tape of the album and decided that it needed another song with Henley on lead vocals. Johns had previously recorded a few takes of the song in London, but abandoned it as he felt it did not work. Geffen tried to get the song recorded with another production team, and Johns, angered by the attempt to record &quot;Nightingale&quot; behind his back, then re-recorded the song with the band at Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 in Hollywood. Even though Johns judged this recording unsatisfactory, it was included in the album.

The album was slated for Quadraphonic release and even given a Quadraphonic catalog number but it was never released in that format.

==Artwork==
The album artwork was created by album cover artist Gary Burden with photography by Henry Diltz. The album was initially designed as a gatefold album that would further open up into a poster; however Geffen thought it would be confusing, and glued it together so that it would not open, and the gatefold image of the band members at Joshua Tree then became orientated the wrong side up. In the documentary &quot;History of the Eagles&quot;, Glenn Frey revealed that the band were all on peyote when the gatefold picture of the band members was shot in Joshua Tree National Park.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing in 1972, Bud Scoppa of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; believed the Eagles had &quot;distinguished&quot; country-rock backgrounds, and said the album is &quot;right behind Jackson Browne&#x27;s record as the best first album this year. And I could be persuaded to remove the word &#x27;first&#x27; from that statement&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau felt that the band wrote good songs, but he was unsure about the authenticity of their country roots so what they produced was &quot;suave and synthetic-brilliant, but false&quot;.

Allmusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann, in his retrospective review, sums up the album as balanced in terms of songwriting, but noting that the three hit singles were sung by Frey and Henley, who would later go on to dominate the band. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as number 368 on their 2012 edition of the 500 greatest albums of all time list with the comment that the album &quot;created a new template for laid-back L.A. country-rock style&quot;. It rose to number 207 in the 2020 edition of the list. It was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Sterling Whitaker rated the non-single album track &quot;Most of Us Are Sad&quot; as being among the Eagles&#x27; 10 most underrated songs.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 102 in its first week of release, rising at number 22 in its sixth week on the chart. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 20, 2001 for shipment of 1 million copies in the United States.

<text>Po Lam (; Cantonese Yale: Bóulàhm) is the northern terminus MTR station of the . It is located on Mau Yip Road, Po Lam, in the New Territories of Hong Kong, sandwiched by Phases 1 to 3 of Metro City. Built by Maeda Corporation, it opened on 18 August 2002. The name of the station is taken from the nearby Po Lam Road North.

==Station layout==



Unlike most MTR stations and unique in the , the concourse, gates and platform of Po Lam station are on the same level. Tracks ascend from underground to ground level at the southern end of the station, along King Lam Estate. A park is located on top of the tracks to cover them.

===Platforms===
There is only one side platform (Platform 1) from which trains depart, in the same direction as they arrive. Trains, as a result, halt on their way from Hang Hau station for another train to depart at the station. Trains also stay here for a shorter period before departing than at other MTR terminals. The single-track design (and the consequent longer train turnback time) limits the maximum train service frequency of the Tseung Kwan O line.

Across from the platform and north of the point where the tracks merge to one, there is a siding that splits from the running line for parking trains. Trains cannot access the platform from the siding, nor can they access the siding from the platform.


==Entrances/exits==

The main exit is on Mau Yip Road, where five pedestrian footbridges link the station to a public transport interchange, shopping malls and residential buildings. There is direct access to Metro City and The Pinnacle from the concourse. Another footbridge crosses Po Fung Road and leads to Po Lam Estate, Yan Ming Court and Verbena Heights.

==Future development==

The government proposed in the Railway Development Strategy 2014 that East Kowloon line will connect Po Lam and Diamond Hill stations, passing through Po Tat, Sau Mau Ping, Shun Tin and Choi Wan stations. It will serve as an alternative route to reach in case of disruption on the , and is expected to open in 2025.

<text>Ballochroy is a megalithic site in Kintyre on the Argyll peninsula in Scotland. It consists of three vertical stones, side by side, aligned with various land features away.

Alexander Thom, known for his work on Stonehenge, maintained that the great length between the stones and the features of distant landscape lent precision to pinpointing the midsummer and winter solstices for ancient observers.

These three stones are considered the most spectacular set of megalithic monuments that cluster around south Argyll. The three mica schist stones were measured at in height. It is possible that this last, smallest, stone may have been broken off at the top. The line of stones is orientated north-east to south-west.

The flat face of the central stone (at right angles to the alignment) indicates the mountain of Cora Bheinn, on the island of Jura, which is away. The shortest stone also faces across the alignment, and points to Beinn a&#x27; Chaolais, the southernmost of the three Paps of Jura. The sun setting here would have given warning of the approach of the solstice.

As with many megalithic sites, the current theories concerning the exact use of the stones at Ballochroy are somewhat controversial.

<text>On the Border is the third studio album by American rock band the Eagles, released on March 22, 1974. Apart from two songs produced by Glyn Johns, it was produced by Bill Szymczyk because the group wanted a more rock‑oriented sound instead of the country-rock feel of the first two albums. It is the first Eagles album to feature guitarist Don Felder. &quot;On the Border&quot; reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and has sold two million copies.

Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;James Dean&quot; and &quot;Best of My Love&quot;. The singles peaked at numbers 32, 77 and 1 respectively. &quot;Best of My Love&quot; became the band&#x27;s first of five chart toppers. The album also includes &quot;My Man&quot;, Bernie Leadon&#x27;s tribute to his deceased friend Gram Parsons. Leadon and Parsons had played together in the pioneer country-rock band Flying Burrito Brothers, before Leadon joined the Eagles.

This is the earliest album by the Eagles to have been released in Quadraphonic surround sound. It was released on Quadraphonic 8-track tape and CD-4 LP. A hidden message, carved into the run-out groove of some vinyl LP copies, reads: &quot;He who hesitates is lunch&quot;.

==Background==
The album was initially produced by Glyn Johns and recorded at Olympic Studios in London, but during the making of the album, disagreement arose between the Eagles and Johns. As the band tried to lean towards a more hard rock sound, they felt that Johns was overemphasizing their country-influenced rock sound. Johns, however, felt that the Eagles were not capable of what the band wanted, and told the band: &quot;You are not a rock-and-roll band, The Who is a rock-and-roll band, and you&#x27;re not that.&quot; The band—Glenn Frey in particular, but not Don Henley—were also unhappy with the no-drug policy of Johns during the recording; furthermore they did not feel at home recording in London. The band was concerned about the lack of success of the previous album &quot;Desperado&quot;, and were more assertive in wanting more input into the album, which Johns was unwilling to allow. The Eagles spent six weeks recording in London, with both the band and the producer becoming frustrated with each other, leading to frequent arguments between Johns and Frey. The band then took a break, decided to find a new producer and discarded all the recordings except for two usable tracks, &quot;Best of My Love&quot; and &quot;You Never Cry Like a Lover&quot;.

The band relocated back to California and hired Bill Szymczyk, who had produced &quot;The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get&quot; by Joe Walsh—who was also managed by their manager Irving Azoff and who would go on to join the Eagles in late 1975—that interested the band. The band recorded the rest of the album at Criteria Studios in Miami and the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. They were allowed more input in how the album was made and enjoyed more freedom with Szymczyk in the making of the album. Szymczyk suggested they bring in a harder-edged guitarist to add slide guitar to the song &quot;Good Day in Hell&quot;. Bernie Leadon suggested his old friend Don Felder, whom they had met and jammed with on a few occasions. The band was so impressed that they invited Felder to become the fifth Eagle. The only other track on this album on which he appeared was &quot;Already Gone&quot;. They credited him as a late arrival on the album&#x27;s liner notes.

On the difference in sound between Johns&#x27; and Szymczyk&#x27;s productions, Henley said: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot less echo with Bill, for one thing. There&#x27;s more of a raw and funky presence. Glyn had a stamp he put on his records which is a deep echo that is really smooth like ice cream&quot;. He thought that the production on the two songs that Johns produced was good and necessary. Frey, however, found that L.A. country-rock records were &quot;all too smooth and glassy&quot;, and wanted a &quot;tougher sound&quot;. Their friend and collaborator JD Souther ascribed the change of producer to &quot;Eagles&#x27; desire to get more of a live, thin sound on the albums&quot;.

The first two singles released were more rock-oriented; Frey was reluctant to release the Johns-produced &quot;Best of My Love&quot; as a single, and held off its release for some months. However, when it was finally released, the label had truncated the song–without the band&#x27;s knowledge or approval–so that it would be more radio-friendly. &quot;Best of My Love&quot; would become their biggest hit thus far, and their first No. 1 on the charts.

==Songs==
&quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;James Dean&quot;, and &quot;Best of My Love&quot; were released as singles from the album, and information on these songs can be found in their respective articles. The following are other noteworthy tracks from the album:

===&quot;My Man&quot;===
Bernie Leadon&#x27;s &quot;My Man&quot; is a tribute to Gram Parsons, who had died of a drug overdose in September 1973. Leadon and Parsons had been members of the pioneering country-rock band The Flying Burrito Brothers. In the lyrics, Leadon makes reference to Parsons&#x27; song &quot;Hickory Wind&quot; (&quot;like a flower he bloomed till that old hickory wind called him home&quot;) which appeared on the Byrds&#x27; groundbreaking country-rock album &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; in 1968, the only Byrds album Parsons appeared on. 
===&quot;On the Border&quot;===
A hard rock song, the track was inspired by the Watergate scandal and fears of the government overstepping its bounds and infringing on people&#x27;s privacy. Barely audible at the end of the song, Glenn Frey can be heard whispering &quot;Say Goodnight, Dick&quot;, a line made famous by Dan Rowan of Rowan and Martin but in this case referring to Richard Nixon&#x27;s resignation. Nixon would indeed resign five months after the release of the album. Henley, however, judged the song they wrote to be a &quot;clumsy, incoherent attempt&quot; as they were still learning how to write. According to Henley, the song was supposed to be &quot;an R&amp;B-type song&quot; but missed the mark.

In the liner notes, &quot;T.N.T.S.&quot; was credited for the vocals on the track; this refers to Tanqueray &#x27;n&#x27; tonic, a drink favored by the producer Szymczyk. According to Henley, the drink &quot;&quot;helped out&quot; on the hand-clap overdub and the Temptations-like background vocals on the title track&quot; by adding an element of spontaneity to the song.

===&quot;Ol&#x27; 55&quot;===
David Geffen played to Glenn Frey a demo of three songs by Tom Waits; Frey loved this song and took it to Henley suggesting that they split the vocals on the song. Frey said: &quot;It&#x27;s such a car thing. Your first car is like your first apartment. You had a mobile studio apartment! &quot;Ol&#x27; 55&quot; was so Southern California, and yet there was some Detroit in it as well. It was that car thing, and I loved the idea of driving home at sunrise, thinking about what had happened the night before.&quot;

===&quot;Good Day in Hell&quot;===
According to Henley, the song was written by Frey as a tribute to Danny Whitten and Gram Parsons. He also described the song as another of their &quot;running commentaries on the perils of the music business and the lifestyle that often comes with it&quot;.

==Critical reception==
In an early review, Janet Maslin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the album &quot;competent and commercial&quot;, but was disappointed that it did not live up to the potential for bigger things shown in &quot;Desperado&quot;. She also thought that with three guitarists in the band, there were &quot;just too many intrusive guitar parts here, too many solos that smack of gratuitous heaviness. Many of the arrangements seem to lose touch with the material somewhere in mid-song.&quot; Overall, she judged the album &quot;a tight and likable collection, with nine potential singles working in its favor and only one dud (&quot;Midnight Flyer&quot;) to weigh it down,&quot; and that it&#x27;s &quot;good enough to make up in high spirits what it lacks in purposefulness.&quot;
William Ruhlmann of AllMusic noted in his retrospective review the R&amp;B direction in its title track that would be pursued more fully in later albums, and considered the album &quot;which looked back to their earlier work and anticipated their later work&quot; to be &quot;a transitional effort that combined even more styles than most of their records did.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album became the band&#x27;s most successful album of the three released thus far. It debuted at number 50 on the US Billboard 200 chart in its first week of its release, peaking at number 17 in its sixth week on the chart. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) two and a half months after its release June 5, 1974, and it was then certified double platinum for shipments of 2 million copies on March 20, 2001.

<text>Harold Perrineau (born August 7, 1963) is an American actor. His breakout role was in the independent film &quot;Smoke&quot; (1995), for which he was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. He went on to appear as Mercutio in &quot;Romeo+Juliet&quot; (1996) and Link in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; (both 2003). On television, he starred as Augustus Hill in the HBO prison drama &quot;Oz&quot; (1997–2003), Michael Dawson in the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2010), and Sheriff Boyd Stevens in the MGM+ horror series &quot;From&quot; (2022–present).

Perrineau has also appeared in the films &quot;The Edge&quot; (1997), &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1999), &quot;Woman on Top&quot; (2000), and &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007). His other television credits include &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; (2012), &quot;Constantine&quot; (2014–2015), &quot;Claws&quot; (2017–2022), and &quot;The Rookie&quot; (2019–2021).

== Early life ==
Perrineau was born in Brooklyn, New York City. His parents changed his name to Williams when he was a child, but he later changed it back, after discovering there was already a Harold Williams in the Screen Actors Guild. He attended Shenandoah University and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.

== Career ==
In 1989, Perrineau was cast as the original Tyrone Jackson in the world premiere of the stage adaptation of the 1980 hit movie &quot;Fame&quot; (now known as &quot;Fame: The Musical&quot;) at the Walnut Street Theatre, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He took the role of Link in &quot;The Matrix&quot; series after the original operator Tank was written out of the script when Marcus Chong was fired over monetary disputes. &quot;Lost&quot; co-star Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje starred with Perrineau on the HBO series &quot;Oz&quot;.

Perrineau played Michael Dawson on ABC&#x27;s hit show &quot;Lost&quot;. He was temporarily written off when his character left the island with his son at the end of season two and did not appear in season three. In July 2007, it was announced he would return to the main cast for the show&#x27;s fourth season. However, the return was short-lived, as the fourth season was his last as a regular cast member. He made one guest appearance in the sixth and final season.

Since his debut single &quot;Stay Strong&quot; in 2007 Perrineau has been working on his musical career. He actively collaborated with music producer Tomo in der Muhlen, known as DJ Tomo Tom Tom, on his debut album, &quot;Seeker&quot;. The first single, &quot;Moving On&quot;, was released October 15, 2011. Perrineau has also done live shows where he performs with a full band: two guitars, bass, drums and keyboards. He performed at Los Angeles club The Mint in April 2010. Perrineau has appeared in MKTO&#x27;s &quot;Thank You&quot; music video and J. Cole&#x27;s &quot;She Knows&quot; music video.

Perrineau starred in &quot;30 Days of Night: Dark Days&quot; with Rhys Coiro, Mia Kirshner, Kiele Sanchez, Diora Baird and Monique Ganderton. Perrineau appeared in the 2008 music video &quot;Yes We Can&quot;.

Perrineau voiced the title character from Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Blade&quot; anime series on G4 in January 2012. He was cast to play the character of Damon Pope, the main antagonist of season 5 of the hit show &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;.

Perrineau starred as Stevie, the bass player, in the TBS comedy &quot;Wedding Band&quot;, which ran from 2012 to 2013.

Perrineau starred as Manny, an angelic messenger, in &quot;Constantine&quot;, the short-lived 2015 television series based on the DC Comics/Vertigo character John Constantine.

He made his Broadway debut in the Roundabout Theatre Company production of Anton Chekov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard,&quot; adapted by Stephen Karam. The play ran from September 2016 to December 4, 2016. Perrineau played Lopakhin, with Diane Lane as Ranevskaya. Also in 2016, Perrineau co-starred in the Amazon Studios legal series &quot;Goliath&quot;.

From 2017 to 2022, Perrineau played Dean, a man on the autism spectrum and the brother of Desna, in TNT&#x27;s &quot;Claws&quot;. He won the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the NAACP Awards. Perrineau starred as a cop, Nick Armstrong, on &quot;The Rookie&quot; for most of season 2 and as a guest on season 3.

In November 2022, Harold Perrineau signed with Independent Artist Group for representation.

== Personal life ==
Perrineau has been married to Brittany Robinson, a former actress and model, since 2002. They have three daughters, including actress Aurora.

<text>Michael Hillegas (April 22, 1729 – September 29, 1804) was the first treasurer of the United States.

==Biography==

Hillegas was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Margaret Schiebenstock (1710 – July 21, 1770) and George Michael Hillegass (February 14, 1696 – October 30, 1749), an immigrant from Germany and a well-to-do merchant involved in iron and sugar. Soon Michael thus had the freedom and resources to participate in local politics. He married Henrietta Boude on May 10, 1753, at Christ Church in Philadelphia, and they went on to have many children. Hillegas was a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from 1765 to 1775 and served as treasurer of the Committee of Safety under Benjamin Franklin in 1774.

On July 29, 1775, Hillegas and fellow patriot George Clymer were appointed by the Continental Congress to share the office of Treasurer of the United Colonies. Because Hillegas edited the Declaration of Independence, when the Declaration of Independence was signed, Clymer&#x27;s signature appeared on the document.

After Clymer&#x27;s resignation on August 6, 1776, Hillegas assumed sole ownership of the office, which he held throughout the remainder of the American Revolution, using much of his own fortune to support the cause. His son, Samuel Hillegas, was also given the authority to sign new currency, known as &quot;Continentals.&quot; Hillegas also served briefly as quartermaster to the army and served on occasional commissions. On September 9, 1776, the Continental Congress officially changed the name of the country to the United States of America, but Hillegas&#x27;s title did not officially change until March 1778. On September 11, 1789, Congress created the Treasury Department, and Alexander Hamilton took the oath of office as the first Secretary of the Treasury. On that same date, Hillegas tendered his resignation, and Samuel Meredith was appointed Treasurer.

Hillegas was also an early member of the American Philosophical Society, along with Franklin. He died in Philadelphia and is buried near Franklin in Christ Church Burial Ground. Late in the 19th century, his descendants petitioned to have his portrait appear on the ten-dollar gold certificate in the series issued in the years 1907 and 1922.

<doc id="1031382" wikidata="Q264914" url="?curid=1031382" title="Jorge Garcia">
<text>Jorge Garcia (born April 28, 1973) is an American actor and comedian. He first came to public attention with his performance as Hector Lopez on the television show &quot;Becker&quot;, but subsequently became best known for his portrayal of Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes in the television series &quot;Lost&quot; from 2004 to 2010. He starred in the Fox television series &quot;Alcatraz&quot; and played a minor character on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. He starred as Jerry Ortega on &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; and can be seen in the Netflix film &quot;The Ridiculous 6&quot;. He currently stars in the comedy series &quot;Bookie&quot;. Garcia also appeared on the cover of Weezer&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Hurley&quot; in a close-up shot from a photo he took with vocalist Rivers Cuomo.

==Early life and education==
Garcia was born in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Dora Mesa, is a Cuban-born professor, and his father, Humberto Garcia, is a Chilean-born doctor. He grew up in San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, California and went to San Clemente High School. He wrestled in high school, where he was given the nickname &quot;Baby-Faced Killer&quot;. As a senior, he was selected by the faculty as &quot;Triton of the Year&quot;, the highest award given to a graduating senior.

Garcia graduated from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1995 as a communication studies major. He also studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse acting school.

==Career==
Garcia spent six years working at Borders while auditioning. He was in a few commercials during that time. He later said that his first taste of street recognition came from starring in a Jack in the Box commercial which was aired frequently on local television.

Garcia was the first actor to be cast on &quot;Lost&quot; after the producers saw him on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; the night before casting began, and created the character of Hugo Reyes specifically for him.
Garcia appeared in the second episode of the eighth season of &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown,&quot; where he lost to Michael Ian Black. He was a contestant on an episode of &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; on Game Show Network. He missed a question about the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 and fell through the trap door.

Garcia is an associate producer and star in the independent film &quot;When We Were Pirates&quot;, in which he plays Jerry, who along with a group of close friends, learns that his childhood love of playing pirates helps him overcome some of the difficulties he faces later in life. He is seen singing in the studio for the upcoming project on an officially released YouTube clip.

During &quot;Lost&quot;″s run, Garcia wrote a blog about the show called &quot;Dispatches from the Island&quot;. He also hosted a weekly podcast, &quot;Geronimo Jack&#x27;s Beard&quot;, in which he discussed the script of Season 6.

Garcia is also featured on the front cover of Weezer&#x27;s album &quot;Hurley,&quot; released on September 10, 2010. The album is named after his character from &quot;Lost&quot;. He performed as a guest vocalist at several Weezer concerts in 2010.

On November 21, 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; announced that Garcia was cast in the upcoming U.S. television series &quot;Alcatraz&quot;. On November 22, 2010, Garcia made a guest appearance on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;s episode &quot;Blitzgiving&quot;. In the episode, references are made to Garcia&#x27;s time on &quot;Lost&quot;.

In 2011, Garcia appeared as a recurring character in &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot;, portraying a caretaker at the Sunshine Center. Starting in January 2012, Garcia portrayed Dr. Diego Soto, an Alcatraz expert, in the Fox series &quot;Alcatraz&quot;. The show was a mid-season replacement for Fox&#x27;s &quot;Terra Nova&quot;. The series was officially canceled by Fox on May 9, 2012, due to dropping viewership throughout its run. Garcia appeared on &quot;The Nerdist&quot; podcast posted June 18, 2012.

In 2015, he joined the cast of &quot;The Healer&quot; starring with British actors Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Camilla Luddington, and Jonathan Pryce.

Garcia launched a biweekly podcast with co-host Ralph Apel dedicated to kaiju films titled &quot;Kaiju Podcast&quot; on November 14, 2016.

In 2022, Garcia competed in season seven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Cyclops&quot; of Team Bad. He was eliminated alongside Jordan Mailata as &quot;Thingamabob&quot; of Team Cuddly.

<doc id="1031386" wikidata="Q1590332" url="?curid=1031386" title="One of These Nights">
<text>One of These Nights is the fourth studio album by American rock band the Eagles, released on June 10, 1975, by Asylum Records. The album was the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, transforming them into international superstars. In July that year, the record became the Eagles&#x27; first number one album on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, yielding three Top 10 singles: &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot; and &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot;. Its title song is the group&#x27;s second number one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album sold four million copies and received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. A single from the album, &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;, was also nominated for Record of the Year, and won the Eagles&#x27; first Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards in 1976. The band embarked on the worldwide &quot;One of These Nights&quot; tour to promote the album.

&quot;One of These Nights&quot; is the last Eagles album to feature the original lineup of Randy Meisner, Glenn Frey, Don Henley, and Bernie Leadon (along with then-new member Don Felder). Leadon left the band after the album&#x27;s tour due to his dissatisfaction with the band&#x27;s shift from country towards a more mainstream rock sound and was replaced by Joe Walsh. The seventh track, &quot;Visions&quot;, is the only Eagles song on which lead guitarist Don Felder sang the lead vocals, despite his desire to write and sing more songs.

==Background==
The Eagles began working on their fourth album in late 1974. Glenn Frey and Don Henley wrote four of the nine songs by themselves, and they also collaborated with other members of the band on three other songs. Many of the songs were written while Frey and Henley were sharing a house in Beverly Hills, including &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;, &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot; and &quot;After the Thrill Is Gone&quot;. In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Henley joked that it was their &quot;satanic country-rock period&quot; because &quot;it was a dark time, both politically and musically&quot; in America, referring to the turmoil in Washington and disco music starting to take off. He added: &quot;We thought, &#x27;Well, how can we write something with that flavor, with that kind of beat, and still have the dangerous guitars?&#x27; We wanted to capture the spirit of the times.&quot;

Frey said that &quot;&quot;One of These Nights&quot; was the most fluid and &#x27;painless&#x27; album [they] ever made&quot;, and thought that the quality of the songs he wrote with Henley had improved dramatically. However, Leadon was becoming increasingly unhappy during the making of the album. He wrote three of the nine songs, none of which was released as a single. He was unhappy with the more rock direction of the band that Frey preferred, at one time walking out of a meeting to discuss which take to use after the recording of a rock track. Leadon would leave the band in late 1975, after the album was released.

Frey also began to sing less as a lead singer starting with this album, singing solo lead on only one song (&quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;) and sharing lead vocals with Henley on another (&quot;After the Thrill Is Gone&quot;). Henley later said: &quot;[Glenn] was generous in that respect ... If I began to do more than he did, it was because if someone had a strong suit he would play that card. &#x27;You sing this, you sing it better,&#x27; that kind of thing.&quot; Randy Meisner sings lead on two songs, one of which, &quot;Take it to the Limit&quot;, a composition he co-wrote with Frey and Henley, was released as the third single from the album. Of the nine Eagles songs to feature Randy Meisner singing solo, this is the only song of his to be released as a single.

==Track information==
&quot;One of These Nights&quot;, &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot; were released as singles.

===&quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot;===
&quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot; was used as the theme music for Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; radio series produced by the BBC in 1978 and 1979. Adams said he had wanted something that sounded &quot;sci-fi&quot; while at the same time suggestive of a traveller, so this banjo-based instrumental struck him as ideal. &quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot; was used subsequently for the television series in 1981 (albeit re-recorded), the sequel radio series produced by Above the Title Productions for the BBC in 2003 and 2004, and (re-recorded once again) for the film produced by Disney/Touchstone in 2005. The original version from &quot;One of These Nights&quot; was used for all original transmissions of all five radio series, and a further version was used for the sixth. The TV adaptation of the series, and also an additional version released on LP record, used an arrangement by Tim Souster. The CD releases of radio series transmitted in 2004 and 2005 used another version arranged by Philip Pope, and recorded by a tribute band The Illegal Eagles, and the 2005 film used a version by Joby Talbot.

===&quot;I Wish You Peace&quot;===
“I Wish You Peace” was written by Bernie Leadon and his then-girlfriend Patti Davis, daughter of Republican then-Governor of California Ronald Reagan. Nancy Reagan had already disowned Patti during this period, ostensibly because of her choice to live together with Leadon as an &quot;unmarried couple&quot;. Years later Don Henley would disparage this song as an Eagles release, describing it as “smarmy cocktail music and certainly not something the Eagles are proud of”. Henley was also annoyed that Davis was given cowriting credit, and told a reporter: &quot;Nobody else wanted [the song]. We didn&#x27;t feel it was up to the band&#x27;s standards, but we put it on anyway as a gesture to keep the band together.&quot;

===&quot;After the Thrill is Gone&quot;===
According to Henley, he and Frey were aware of B.B. King&#x27;s song &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot;, and wrote the song to explore the aftermath: &quot;We know that the thrill is gone – so, now what?&quot; On the studio recording (and live performances during Frey&#x27;s lifetime), Frey sings lead on the verses and choruses, while Henley sings lead on the bridge.

==Artwork==
The cover for the album is an image of an artwork by Boyd Elder, also known as &quot;El Chingadero&quot;. Elder knew the Eagles in 1972 when pieces of his work were exhibited in an art gallery in Venice, California; among those who attended the opening were members of the Eagles who performed &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; at the show, an early appearance by the band as the Eagles. In 1973, Elder started to create artwork of painted skulls with wings and feathers. Elder was a friend of the album cover designer Gary Burden, who was responsible for the Eagles&#x27; three previous albums and was interested in using one of Elder&#x27;s pieces for this cover. Elder presented two of his works to the Eagles in Dallas in late 1974, one of which was then chosen for the cover of &quot;One of These Nights&quot;. Later another work of Elder, an image of an eagle&#x27;s skull, would be used for the cover of &quot;Their Greatest Hits&quot; album. The painted animal skull motif was also used in the cover for their compilation album &quot;The Very Best of&quot;, and the skull of &quot;One of These Nights&quot; was used for the cover of the documentary &quot;History of the Eagles&quot;.

The album cover for &quot;One of These Nights&quot; is the last Eagles album design on which Burden was involved. He made the skull stand up off the page by debossing large areas together with detailed and elaborate embossing in the wings and feathers. According to Burden, the cover image represents where the band was coming from and where they were going – &quot;The cow skull is pure cowboy, folk, the decorations are American Indian inspired and the future is represented by the more polished reflective glass beaded surfaces covering the skull. All set against the dark eagle feather wings that speak of mysterious powers.&quot; The album artwork received a Grammy nomination for Best Album Package.

==Album pressing==
Original vinyl record pressings of &quot;One of These Nights&quot; (Elektra/Asylum catalog no. 7E-1039) had the following text engraved in the run-out grooves of each album side:

# Side one: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry --&quot;
# Side two: &quot;-- Nothing will be O.K.!&quot;

The Eagles and their producer Bill Szymczyk would continue the trend of including such &quot;hidden messages&quot; in the run-out grooves on several subsequent albums.

This is the second album by the Eagles to have a Quadraphonic surround sound pressing. It was released on Quadraphonic 8-track tape and CD-4 LP.

==Critical reception==
Stephen Holden of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in an early review of the album, expressed a liking for the album but did not consider it a great album. He thought the band&#x27;s ensemble playing &quot;unprecedentedly excellent&quot; but they &quot;lack an outstanding singer&quot;, and that while &quot;many of their tunes are pretty, none are eloquent.&quot; He added: &quot;And for all their worldly perceptiveness, the Eagles&#x27; lyrics never transcend Hollywood slickness. Their hard rock has always seemed a bit forced, constructed more from commercial considerations than from any urgent impulse to boogie. And when the Eagles attempt to communicate wild sexuality, they sound only boyishly enthused. These limitations, however, seem built into the latter-day concept of Southern California rock, of which the Eagles remain the unrivaled exponents.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; judged the album to be the band&#x27;s &quot;most musically adventurous outing yet, flirting with disco on the title song, a waltz on &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot;, and bluegrass psychedelia on Leadon&#x27;s &quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot;.

In a retrospective review, William Ruhlmann of AllMusic was more favorable. He thought that it had more original material and that the material was more polished, writing: &quot;&quot;One of These Nights&quot; was the culmination of the blend of rock, country, and folk styles the Eagles had been making since their start; there wasn&#x27;t much that was new, just the same sorts of things done better than they had been before. In particular, a lyrical stance—knowing and disillusioned, but desperately hopeful—had evolved, and the musical arrangements were tighter and more purposeful. The result was the Eagles&#x27; best-realized and most popular album so far.&quot;

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Sterling Whitaker rated both &quot;One of These Nights&quot; and &quot;After the Thrill Has Gone&quot; as being among the Eagles&#x27; 10 most underrated songs.

<doc id="1031394" wikidata="Q457242" url="?curid=1031394" title="Spanish protectorate in Morocco">
<text>The Spanish protectorate in Morocco was established on 27 November 1912 by a treaty between France and Spain that converted the Spanish sphere of influence in Morocco into a formal protectorate.

The Spanish protectorate consisted of a northern strip on the Mediterranean and the Strait of Gibraltar, and a southern part of the protectorate around Cape Juby, bordering the Spanish Sahara. The northern zone became part of independent Morocco on 7 April 1956, shortly after France relinquished its protectorate. Spain finally ceded its southern zone through the Treaty of Angra de Cintra on 1 April 1958, after the short Ifni War. The city of Tangier was excluded from the Spanish protectorate and received a special internationally controlled status as Tangier International Zone.

Since France already held a protectorate over most of the country and had controlled Morocco&#x27;s foreign affairs since 30 March 1912, it also held the power to delegate a zone to Spanish protection. The surface area of the zone was about .

==History==

===Background===
At a time when other European nations were acquiring or expanding their colonial empires, Spain&#x27;s had generally gained independence. Its disastrous 1898 war with the United States stripped Spain of its few overseas provinces and exposed an inferior military. Yet, due to Morocco&#x27;s proximity and the presence of Ceuta and Melilla, Spain eyed expansion in northern Morocco, despite an overall lack of enthusiasm for new colonial enterprises. During the last decades of the 19th century, Spain nervously watched the increasing influence of its European rivals in the Maghreb. Thus, ensuring Spanish security offered the most compelling reason to intervene. For example, Liberal leader Montero Ríos argued that if northwestern Morocco were to come under French control, Spain would be vulnerable to France from both north and south. Furthermore, the discovery of iron ore near Melilla convinced many that Morocco contained vast mineral wealth.

The key motivation for intervention, although less openly stated, was the belief that Morocco was Spain&#x27;s last chance to maintain its position in the Concert of Europe, as it was the one area in which it could claim sufficient interest to generate some diplomatic strength with respect to the European powers. There was also the then-widespread belief in Europe that colonies increased a nation&#x27;s prestige. Those beliefs encouraged Spanish politicians to adopt a forward policy in Morocco.

===Formation===

In a convention dated 27 June 1900 (at the same time as Treaty of Paris (1900)), France and Spain agreed to recognize separate zones of influence in Morocco, but did not specify their boundaries. In 1902, France offered Spain all of Morocco north of the Sebou River and south of the Sous River, but Spain declined in the belief that such a division would offend Britain. The British and French, without any Spanish insistence, acknowledged Spain&#x27;s right to a zone of influence in Morocco in Article 8 of the of 8 April 1904:

What exactly &quot;special consideration&quot; meant was dealt with in the secret third and fourth articles, specifying that Spain would be required to recognize Articles 4 and 7 of the treaty but could decline the &quot;special consideration&quot; if it wished:

The British goal in these negotiations with France was to ensure that a weaker power (Spain) held the strategic coast opposite Gibraltar in return for Britain ceding all their influence in Morocco. France began negotiating with Spain at once, but the offer of 1902 was no longer on the table. Since France had given up its ambitions in Ottoman Libya in a convention with Italy in 1903, it felt entitled to a greater share of Morocco. On 3 October 1904, France and Spain concluded a treaty that defined their precise zones. Spain received a zone of influence consisting of a northern strip of territory and a southern strip. The northern strip did not reach to the border of French Algeria, nor did it include Tangier, soon to be internationalized. The southern strip represented the southernmost part of Morocco as recognized by the European powers: the territory to its south, Saguia el-Hamra, was recognized by France as an exclusively Spanish zone. The treaty also recognized the Spanish exclave of Ifni and delimited its borders.

In March 1905, the German &quot;Kaiser&quot;, Wilhelm II, visited Tangier, a city of international character in northern Morocco. There he loudly touted Germany&#x27;s economic interests in Morocco and assured the Sultan of financial assistance in the event of a threat to Moroccan independence. At Wilhelm&#x27;s urging, Sultan Abd el Aziz called for an international conference. The final act of the Algeciras Conference (7 April 1906) created the State Bank of Morocco, guaranteed the attending powers equal commercial rights in Morocco and created a native Moroccan police force led by French and Spanish officers.

The final Spanish zone of influence consisted of a northern strip and a southern strip centered on Cape Juby. The consideration of the southern strip as part of the protectorate back in 1912 eventually gave Morocco a solid legal claim to the territory in the 1950s. While the sparsely populated Cape Juby was administered as a single entity with Spanish Sahara, the northern territories were administered, separately, as a Spanish protectorate with its capital at Tetuán.

The Protectorate system was established in 1912. The Islamic legal system of &quot;qadis&quot; was formally maintained.

===Rif War===

Following the First World War, the Republic of the Rif, led by the guerrilla leader Abd el-Krim, was a breakaway state that existed from 1921 to 1926 in the Rif region, when it was subdued and dissolved by a joint expedition of the Spanish Army of Africa and French forces during the Rif War.

The Spanish lost more than 13,000 soldiers at Annual in July–August 1921. Controversy in Spain over the early conduct in the war was a driving factor behind the military coup by General Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923 which foreshadowed the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39.

After the successful 1925 Alhucemas landing, the French–Spanish alliance ended up achieving victory and putting an end to the war.

===Second Spanish Republic===
Before 1934, the southern part of the protectorate (Tekna) had been governed from Cape Juby (within the same southern strip) since 1912; Cape Juby was also the seat of Spanish West Africa. Then, in 1934, the southern part began to being managed directly from Tetuán (in the northern part of the protectorate) and the seat of Spanish West Africa was moved from Cape Juby to the territory of Ifni (not a part of the protectorate), which had been occupied by the Spaniards that year.

===Spanish Civil War===

The Spanish Civil War started in 1936 with the partially successful coup against the Republican Government, which began in Spanish Morocco by an uprising of the Spanish Army of Africa stationed there, although within a day uprisings in Spain itself broke out. This force, which included a considerable number of Moroccan troops (regulares), was under the command of Francisco Franco (who spent much time in Morocco) and became the core of the Spanish Nationalist Army. The Communist Party of Spain and Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), advocated anti-colonial policies, and pressured the Republican government to support the independence of Spanish Morocco, intending to create a rebellion at Franco&#x27;s back and cause disaffection among his Moroccan troops. The government – then led by the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) — rejected that course of action as it would have likely resulted in conflict with France, the colonial ruler of the other portion of Morocco.

Because the locally recruited Muslim regulares had been among Franco&#x27;s most effective troops, the protectorate enjoyed more political freedom and autonomy than Francoist Spain-proper after Franco&#x27;s victory. The area held competing political parties and a Moroccan nationalist press, which often criticized the Spanish government.

===World War II===

Spanish troops provisionally occupied Tangier during World War II, on the pretext that an Italian invasion was imminent.

===Retrocession to Morocco===

In 1956, when France ended its protectorate over Morocco, Spain discontinued the protectorate and retroceded the territory to the newly independent kingdom, while retaining the &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot; which were part of Spain prior to the colonial period, Cape Juby, Ifni, and other colonies (such as Spanish Sahara) outside of Morocco. Unwilling to accept this, the Moroccan Army of Liberation waged war against the Spanish forces. In the 1958 Ifni War, which spread from Sidi Ifni to Río de Oro, Morocco gained Tarfaya (the southern part of the protectorate) and reduced the Spanish control of the Ifni territory to the perimeter of the city itself. Morocco and Spain negotiated for over a year over Ifni, with Morocco also wanting control of Ceuta and Melilla, while Spain was only willing to give up control of Ifni. On 5 January 1969 Morocco and Spain signed the treaty ceding Ifni to Morocco.

As of 2025, Morocco still claims Ceuta and Melilla as integral parts of the country, and considers them to be under foreign occupation, comparing their status to that of Gibraltar. Spain considers both cities integral parts of the Spanish geography, since they were part of Spain for centuries.

==Economy==

===Mines===
The iron mines in the Rif were one of the sources of income. Their exploitation led to an economic boom in Melilla.

===Transport===
After the Treaty of Algeciras signed in April 1906, where the northern part of Morocco was placed under Spanish administration, the Spanish started to develop this mineral-rich area, and numerous narrow gauge railways were built.

==Administration==

The administrative regime of the Protectorate is derived from the concept of protectorate itself, with a formal duality of authorities. On the one hand, there is a Moroccan administration, headed by a &quot;Khalifa&quot; (), who exercised, by delegation of the Sultan, all his powers, mainly the legislative, which he exercised through the &quot;dahir&quot; (decree). He was also the highest religious authority. This government led by the Khalifa received the name of &quot;Makhzen&quot; and was divided into departments, like ministries, coordinated by the Grand Vizier. The ministers were the &quot;qadi al-qudat&quot; (chief or judge of judges), the Vizier of the &quot;Habus&quot; (inalienable patrimony whose income is destined to a pious or religious work or institution), the &quot;amin al-amlak&quot; and the &quot;amin al-umana&quot; (minister of Finance). It had an advisory council made up of two representatives from each of the five regions. The &quot;Khalifa&quot; was chosen by the Sultan from a pair proposed by the Spanish government. The first &quot;Khalifa&quot; was Mohammed Mehedi Ould Ben Ismael. Ishmael was the brother of Sultan Hassan I and later Sultan Hassan I was the great-uncle of the second &quot;Khalifa&quot;. The first &quot;Khalifa&quot; took office in Tetouan on 27 April 1913. Only two Khalifas held office until the independence of Morocco, Muley el Mehdi (between 1913 and 1923) and his son Muley el Hassán bin el Mehdi (who took office at the age of thirteen, ruling between 1925 and 1941 and 1945 and 1956).

The Spanish administration was led by a High Commissioner, formally accredited to the Khalifa but in fact the highest authority in the Protectorate. The High Commissary directed the political action of Spain in the Protectorate, and orders and instructions emanated from it. The high commissioner was assisted by various departments (Indigenous Affairs Development and Finance). There was a territorial controller in each of the regions, directly represented to the Delegation of Indigenous Affairs. Subordinate to him, there was a next level, with regional auditors and, finally, local auditors. The maintenance of order was in charge of the Regulares (forces of the Spanish army with &quot;indigenous&quot; Rif people) and the Indigenous Police. On the military side, the high commissioner was assisted by three commanders based in Ceuta, Melilla and Larache.

The administrative organization was arranged, at a general level, in this way: The High Commissioner was responsible for the direction of the Spanish action in the entire area and all the authorities (including the military) were subordinate to him. Among its activities were to intervene in the acts of the Khalifa, the regime of the cities in which the consuls acted as controllers, to dictate the general policy and to approve or direct, where appropriate, military operations. The Indigenous services department was entrusted with the General Secretariat and advising on all matters relating to relations with the Kabyles, the inspection of the Islamic Justice Administration, relations with the Consular Jurisdiction for the protection of the natives and with the Sheriff for everything related to real estate and the vindication of property, the inspection of schools and health care centers and the Spanish missions in educational work.

In Morocco, there was no prior organization to ensure public health, except in Tangier, and the Spanish tried to remedy this deficiency, creating in 1916 the Health Inspectorate, within the Office of Indigenous Affairs. The Spanish had to overcome the distrust that Moroccans felt towards their healers and home remedies, carrying out large vaccination campaigns that contributed to the prestige of the protecting country. Along with health action, culture was the other pending subject for Moroccans, since teaching was closely linked to religion and consisted of memorizing the Quran. Spain entrusted the task of educating the population to the Delegation of Indigenous Affairs, which depended on a Board of Education that was created on 3 April 1913. This Board was born with the purpose of training the personnel who would be dedicated to this task and as an instrument to learn about geography, literature, history and the Moroccan law. To this end, a Center for Moroccan Studies was organized in the Free Institute of Diplomatic and Consular Careers and Arabic chairs were created in some business schools and an Arabic board was created in the Board for the Extension of Studies.

Subsequently, Indigenous Affairs offices were created in Melilla and Ceuta that exercised surveillance functions, somewhat similar, in the occupied regions. In 1937, in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, the territorial organization of Spanish Morocco was in charge of the High Commissioner of the Territory and a Lieutenant Colonel responsible for civil and military affairs.

The High Commissioner and the Khalifa had their respective residences in two adjacent palaces in Tétouan, which following Morocco&#x27;s independence in 1956 have been merged into a single compound and repurposed as the Royal Palace of Tétouan.

<text>The Distributor Wing DW-1 was a prototype agricultural aircraft of unorthodox design, designed by Ken Razak in the United States and marketed by Aerial Distributors in the 1960s.

==Design==
Developed with assistance from NASA, the University of Wichita and the University of Robbins, California, the aircraft was unusual in that it had a second engine mounted directly below its main powerplant, using this second motor to power a distribution system that used compressed air to carry dry chemicals from a hopper and blow them out of the trailing edges of its wings, over the flaps. Varying the power of this blower engine also provided lift control.

==Flight testing and cancellation==
First flown on January 30, 1965, the DW-1 was flight tested over several years, with the cowling being revised during testing. Development was terminated by economic conditions in the fertilizer market.

<text>Nikolai Alekseyevich Ostrovsky (; ; 29 September 1904 – 22 December 1936) was a Soviet socialist realist writer. He is best known for his novel &quot;How the Steel Was Tempered&quot;.

==Life==
Ostrovsky was born in the village of &quot;Viliya&quot; (today a village in Rivne Raion (until 2020 it was situated in Ostroh Raion), Rivne Oblast) in the Volhynian Governorate (Volhynia), then part of the Russian Empire, into a Ukrainian working-class family. He attended a parochial school until he was nine and was an honor student. In 1914, his family moved to the railroad town of Shepetivka (today in Khmelnytskyi Oblast) where Ostrovsky started working in the kitchens at the railroad station, a timber yard, then becoming a stoker&#x27;s mate and then an electrician at the local power station. In 1917, at the age of thirteen he became a Bolshevik party activist. At the same period he developed ankylosing spondylitis, which would later blind and paralyze him.

According to the official biography, when the Germans occupied the town in the spring of 1918, Ostrovsky ran errands for the local Bolshevik underground. In July 1918 he joined the Komsomol and the Red Army in August. He served in the Kotovsky cavalry brigade. In 1920 he was reportedly wounded near Lviv and contracted typhus. He returned to the army only to be wounded again and was demobilized on medical grounds.

In 1921, he began working in railway workshops of Kiev as an electrician and as the secretary of the local Komsomol.

Having rheumatism and typhus, in August 1922 he was sent to Berdyansk, a resort on the Sea of Azov, for treatment. In October 1922 he was officially declared an invalid; however he continued working. In 1923 he was appointed Commissar of the Red Army&#x27;s Second Training Battalion and Komsomol secretary for Berezdiv in western Ukraine. In January 1924 he went to Iziaslav as the head of Komsomol district committee and in August 1924 he joined the Communist Party. In 1925, with his health rapidly declining, he went to Kharkiv for medical treatment and in May 1926 he went to a sanatorium in the Crimea. By December 1926 polyarthritis deprived him of almost all mobility and he became virtually bedridden. In December 1927 Ostrovsky began a correspondence course at the Sverdlov Communist University in Moscow that he completed in June 1929. In August, he lost his vision.

Undaunted by his immobility and blindness, in 1930, he began work on his first novel, &quot;How the Steel Was Tempered&quot;, which became renowned and influential in the Communist world. He also wrote articles for newspapers and journals and spoke often on the radio. In April 1932 he became a member of the Moscow branch of the Association of Proletarian Writers and in June 1934 he joined the Union of Soviet Writers. On 1 October 1935, he was awarded the Order of Lenin.

After living for years with paralysis, illness and blindness due to congenital ankylosing spondylitis as well as complications from typhus, Ostrovsky died on 22 December 1936, aged 32. Because of his early death, he was unable to complete his second novel, &quot;Born of the Storm&quot;, on the Russian Civil War.

==Legacy==

His novel &quot;How the Steel Was Tempered&quot; is considered one of the most influential works of Communist literature. In Moscow during the Communist period the Ostrovsky Museum and the Ostrovsky Humanitarian centre were built. They preserve his study and bedroom, while other exhibits include showcases of the achievements of disabled people like Nikolai Fenomenov and Ludmilla Rogova.

There also was established by the Central Committee of Komsomol of Ukraine the Ostrovsky Republican Prize.

The 2015 Ukrainian decommunization laws ban the use of Ostrovsky&#x27;s name for the naming of public places. Hence Kyiv&#x27;s Ostrovsky Park was renamed Mykola Zerov Park in 2020.

A monument to Ostrovsky in Shepetivka was dismantled in December 2022 after the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture and Information Policy had removed it from its list of &quot;monumental art of local significance&quot;.

<text>Gary Russell (born 18 September 1963) is a British freelance writer, producer and former child actor. As a writer, he is best known for his work in connection with the television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its spin-offs in other media. As an actor, he is best known for playing Dick Kirrin in the British 1978 television series &quot;The Famous Five&quot;.

==Biography==
Russell was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire. His on-screen acting career included leading roles in the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of E. Nesbit&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; as Cyril, ITV&#x27;s adaptations of Enid Blyton&#x27;s Famous Five novels (as Dick) and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Look &amp; Read&quot; schools series, playing Lord Edward Dark in &quot;Dark Towers&quot;. He also spent seasons performing with Prospect Theatre Company and the Royal National Theatre.

He has written guide books, under the pseudonym Warren Martyn, to &quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for Virgin Publishing. He was editor of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; between 1992 and 1995. He was the producer for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; licensed audio drama tie-ins at Big Finish Productions from its inception in 1998 until July 2006, when he stepped down to work for BBC Wales as a Script Editor on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; and &quot;Torchwood&quot;. He has written a number of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off novels and in 2000 co-wrote with executive producer Philip Segal the book &quot;Doctor Who: Regeneration&quot; (HarperCollins, ), the making-of book of the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie, as well as the TV movie&#x27;s novelisation in 1996.

He wrote a series of &quot;The Art of The Lord of the Rings&quot;, one per film, plus a fourth featuring material that could not be fitted into the individual volumes, and contributed to &quot;Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic&quot; with Andy Serkis. He also wrote the behind-the-scenes book on the making of the Matthew Warchus directed 2007 stage musical version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. His behind-the-scenes book &quot;Doctor Who: The Inside Story&quot; was published in October 2006, coinciding with his joining the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production team. His most recent reference work was also for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;; published in 2007 by BBC Books, &quot;The Doctor Who Encyclopedia&quot; is a guide to the current &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series (2005–present), which has been regularly updated (most recently in 2012) and published both in hardback and via an app. He also wrote a similar encyclopedia for &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;The Torchwood Archive&quot;, a semi-fictional guide to the show. He also co-produced and directed the animated mini series &quot;The Infinite Quest&quot; and &quot;Dreamland&quot;, which tied in with the current television series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as well as a series of award-winning animated online games also based on the show.

In 2011, having left BBC Wales, he briefly returned to Big Finish to produce the &quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot; and &quot;Gallifrey&quot; audios, before moving to Australia and becoming the Executive Producer at animation company Planet 55 Studios. There he has overseen the development and production of a new children&#x27;s sci-fi cartoon &quot;Prisoner Zero&quot; for ABC Television. He returned to the UK in 2016.

<doc id="1031407" wikidata="Q8047127" url="?curid=1031407" title="Yakkha people">
<text>Yakkha or Dewan (Nepali याक्खा, Yākkhā) is an indigenous ethnic group from the Indian subcontinent, mainly in modern-day Nepal and present-day India (related to other Kirat groups, like the Limbu, Sunuwar, Rai, and more distantly all other Sino-Tibetan peoples). It is one of the descendants of Nepal&#x27;s prehistoric Kirat dynasty. The Yakkha people are subsistence farmers who inhabit the lower Arun valley in eastern Nepal. They number only a few thousand and their language is nearly extinct.

==Etymology==
Scholars have different opinions regarding the origin of the word &quot;Yakkha&quot;. One school of thought claims that the ethnonym &quot;Yakkha&quot; as per the Aryan Sanskrit grammar had been spelled in the Aryan-Hindu mythologies as &quot;Yaksa-sh&quot; (like Bhisu-shu for an ascetic &quot;Bhikchu&quot; of the Buddhist holy scripts). Although the legendary Yaksa-sh, by the corrupt name of Yakkha, is mentioned in religious Hindu texts, the Vedas and ancient Sanskrit literature, Yakkha has historically been consistent in the use of its own endonyms. &quot;Yakkhawa&quot; or &quot;Yakkhaba&quot; is used to denote the male person and &quot;Yakkhama&quot; to denote the female person.

==Exonyms==
The Yakkhas are also known by the exonyms Dewan, Jimi and Rai titles they accepted after the conquest of the Kirat land by the Gorkhas under Prithvi Narayan Shah. The Yakkhas were not only given ownership of the land but were also given the responsibility of collecting taxes from the lands utilised by Yakkhas as well as non-Yakkhas living in the area. In Darjeeling district, Kalimpong district and Sikkim of India, Dewan is commonly used as a synonym of Yakkha, and as Dewans they are placed in the Other Backward Class category.

==Yakkha Land (Yākkhālen)==
Today, the &quot;Yakkha Motherland&quot; is considered a patch among the historic Kirat region (i.e., east of the Kathmandu valley). During the National Unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah, the traditional bases of the Kirat Lands were merged. The Far Kirat (Pallo Kirat) of the Limbuwan area to the east of the Arun River was divided into seventeen Thums. Among these Seventeen Thums, the Panch (5) Khapan, Panch (5) Majhiya and Das (10) Majhiya; Tin Thum Yakkhalen are regarded as the traditional area of the Yakkhas. This Yakkha area is the Southern part of Sankhuwasabha district bordering the Terhathum District and Taplejung District in the East; Dhankuta District in the South; and Bhojpur District in the West; of the Eastern Nepal. &quot;Sibhuwa, Syabun, Wana, Dadagau, Swachi, Yangsijong, Wabun, Maidane, Chitlang&quot; are the names of Panch-Khapan; &quot;Madi Mulkharka, Tamafok, Tellok, Mamgling, Ankhibhuin, Hombong, Marrek, Chanuwa, Dandagaun,&quot; etc. are the names of the Dash-Majhiyas and &quot;Hattisudhe, Kingring, Chapabhuin, Aambote, Chainpur&quot; etc. are the name of Panch-Majhiyas.

==Religion, language and culture==
The Yakkha’s have a distinct language, culture and tradition. The Yakkha language is a Tibeto-Burman language. The onset of modernism and influence from external factors have caused a rapid disappearance of the Yakkha language. The Yakkhas practice the Kirati religion of nature worship. There are 32 family names (Thar) in the Yakkhas. Each Thar also has a sub-group called the Sameychong. Marriages do not occur between families sharing the same Sameychong.

==Population==
As per the National Population and Housing Census 2021 of Nepal, the population of Yakkhas in Nepal was 17,460 (0.06% of the total population of Nepal). As per the 2011 Nepal census of Nepal, the population of Yakkhas in Nepal was 24,336 (0.1% of the total population of Nepal). As per the population census of Nepal 2001, there were 17,003 Yakkhas in Nepal. A few thousand Yakkhas live in Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts, Sikkim, North-Eastern states and other parts of India.

As per the 2021 Nepal census, the population of Yakkha people by province is as follows:
* Koshi Province: 16,451
* Madhesh Province: 90
* Bagmati Province: 682
* Gandaki Province: 39
* Lumbini Province: 182
* Karnali Province: 0
* Sudurpashchim Province: 10

As per the 2021 Nepal census, the population of Yakkha people by district is as follows:

* Sankhuwasabha: 5752
* Dhankuta: 4344
* Terhathum: 180
* Panchthar: 471

<doc id="1031411" wikidata="Q2915520" url="?curid=1031411" title="Powered parachute">
<text>A powered parachute, often abbreviated PPC, and also called a motorized parachute or paraplane, is a type of aircraft that consists of a parafoil with a motor and wheels.

The FAA defines a powered parachute as &quot;a powered aircraft a flexible or semi-rigid wing connected to a fuselage so that the wing is not in position for flight until the aircraft is in motion. The fuselage of a powered parachute contains the aircraft engine, a seat for each occupant and is attached to the aircraft&#x27;s landing gear.&quot;

While in flight, and due to the design of the parafoil, PPCs effectively travel at a fixed airspeed, typically about . PPCs operate safely at heights ranging from a few feet off the ground (e.g., skimming, fly-bys) to altitudes as high as 10,000+ ft (3+ km), but typical operating heights are between above ground level (AGL). Equipped with a 5-15 gallon fuel tank (depending on the engine and weight limitations), PPCs can typically be flown for about three hours before requiring refueling. They have very short take-off and landing rolls, sometimes less than .

PPCs are among the least expensive aerial vehicles, and are considered a cost-effective way to become an aviator. A new single-seat PPC may cost as little as $10,000, while a two-seat PPC starts around $20,000. Top end two-seat PPCs may cost $35,000 or more, depending on options. The empty weight of a PPC can range from and payload can be upwards of .

In the United States, many of the smallest single-seat PPCs are flown under 14 C.F.R. § 103 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and are classified as ultralight aircraft, which allows them to be flown without a license or flight instruction. Flight instruction is, however, highly recommended, and an average student can learn to fly a PPC safely with 5 to 10 hours of flight instruction. Two-seat PPCs are classified as light sport aircraft in the United States, which means the pilot must have at least a sport pilot certificate issued by the FAA to fly them. A minimum of 12 hours of flight instruction, including 2 hours of solo as a student pilot, are required to obtain this certificate. Powered parachuting is not to be confused with powered paragliding.

== Confusion with powered paragliding ==
There is often confusion about the differences between powered parachutes (PPC) and powered paragliders (PPG), both terminologically and even sometimes visually, particularly in flight.

In simple terms, PPCs are often controlled using steering bars pushed on by the &quot;feet&quot; to operate the steering controls, although there are exceptions such as the Australian Aerochute and the German Xcitor. The airframe is an integral component of the aircraft (as established by FAA regulations).

PPGs, on the other hand, almost exclusively steer using the &quot;hands&quot; to pull on the steering lines. When paragliding, an airframe is considered purely a higher end option; in fact, since a PPG wing is always to be attached to the harness, if the airframe used in a PPG failed in any way, the wing would continue to support the weight of the occupants and motor through the harness. In addition, because PPGs use smaller low-power engines to stay within 14 C.F.R. § 103 regulations, they frequently use a higher performance parafoil that visually appears thinner and more elliptical to compensate.

Any other distinctions are less clear. In the United States, all paragliding equipment must fall within 14 C.F.R. § 103, and pilot licensing (in the strict legal sense) is not applicable, which is not much different from ultralight PPCs. Other lines are blurred further. For example, some people previously argued that two-seat flying is only allowed using a PPC, but &quot;tandem&quot; (two-seat) paragliding is readily doable in many countries throughout the world, and limited types of tandem paragliding are legally authorized in the U.S. as a result of an FAA exemption for flight training only (since 2018, with subsequent extensions).

Another contributing reason for confusion nowadays comes from the fact that some aircraft and kit builders market ultralight-class rolling airframes that can be configured with either PPG-style hand steering or PPC-style foot steering (along with wider canopy attachment points), with the later sold as a 14 C.F.R. § 103 &#x27;powered parachute&#x27;. The net result is nearly identical aircraft, albeit with different steering systems and potentially different canopy types.

== Safety ==

PPCs are considered by some to be safer than normal fixed-wing aircraft because of their inherent stability, limited response to control inputs, and stall resistance. There are two primary means to control a PPC: increasing or decreasing engine power (which controls the vertical rate of climb) and deflecting the right or left trailing edge of the parafoil—by moving the steering bars with the feet—which turns the aircraft right or left.

Flaring is generally used to make fine adjustments in altitude when flying close to the ground and, in particular, when landing. In a powered parachute, flaring refers to pushing on both of the steering bars simultaneously, which causes the left and right trailing edges of the canopy to be pulled downwards at the same time. The result of this is that the airframe moves forward of the wing (on the transverse axis), airspeed is reduced, the angle of attack increases, and the aircraft temporarily gains additional lift. Done properly, the primary benefit of this maneuver is that it softens a landing (and especially an engine-out landing) within the last few feet off the ground.


The power-off glide ratio of a PPC ranges from 3:1 to 6:1. Glide ratio varies depending on the chute size and shape. Engine-off landings are generally safe, provided that the aircraft is within glide range of a suitable landing zone and the pilot is properly trained in the use of proper flaring technique.

Although possible, it is difficult to cause the aircraft to get into a dangerous attitude, stall, or chute collapse by means of pilot control inputs. Chute collapse is considered by many pilots to be virtually impossible with square wings. The wing is more likely to collapse with the more maneuverable, but inherently less stable, elliptical wing, but such collapses are normally followed by an immediate reflation and often go unnoticed by the pilot. In the rare circumstances where an elliptical wing collapses, the collapse is caused either by some extreme adverse meteorological condition or by pilot error. The FAA reports that over 80 percent of all aviation accidents are due to pilot error. Inflatable ram-air elliptical wings can have upward of 30 individual cells whereas square wings typically have fewer than 13 cells.

The main hazards one faces while flying a PPC are associated with wind and obstacles. Flight should not be attempted in winds exceeding 10–15 mph or in gusty conditions. Wind hazards include terrain-induced air disturbances called rotors (it is advisable to stay upwind of trees, mountains, and other obstacles that disturb the flow of the wind). Wake turbulence created by the passage of other aircraft (referred to as &quot;wingtip vortices&quot;), especially aircraft that are heavy, aerodynamically &quot;dirty&quot;, and slow, pose another significant hazard. Also, since the slow-moving PPC, like a helicopter, is particularly well equipped to fly safely near the ground, special care must be taken to avoid power lines, trees, and other low-level terrain obstacles.

==Operations==
PPC pilots typically enjoy flying low and slow, and the PPC is an excellent platform for sightseeing and photography. PPCs are also used in agriculture, and occasionally by law enforcement agencies and flight search organizations.

PPCs do not need an airport to take off and land. Many pilots choose and prefer to fly from back yard strips, small airports, and mowed hay fields.

In the United States, Part 103 ultralight PPCs (like other classes of ultralight aircraft) are not allowed to fly at night, and not over densely populated areas. However, the FAA implemented the sport pilot rule in 2004, which expanded the areas over and airspace in which light sport aircraft (LSA) PPCs can legally fly. In fact, a properly equipped PPC may even be flown at night or over metropolitan areas by a private pilot with a PPC rating.

==Uses==
===Law enforcement===
Powered parachutes have operated in an observation platform role by police departments, and have assisted with suspect captures, river rescues, critical infrastructure over-flights, crime scene photos, narcotics enforcement and crime suppression, at a small fraction of the cost of a police helicopter. In one case, this low-cost aviation asset was procured from the U.S. Department of Justice, Aviation Technology Program.

===Emergency medical services===

The I-Fly Maverick was a street-legal experimental certified aircraft designed to provide emergency medical services to the Huaorani indigenous people in the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador.

===Hunting and scouting===
It is generally illegal in the U.S. to actually hunt/shoot from any aircraft, except in very limited certain circumstances. However, a PPC is considered an ideal aircraft for initially scouting animal and herd locations in the days or weeks prior to a hunting season, due to its naturally slower flight characteristics. During hunting season, most U.S. states have strict rules about mandatory waiting periods between the time a hunter uses an aircraft and can actually hunt, and virtually all have restrictions and serious penalties for the use of any aircraft to hunt in real-time (e.g., air-to-ground collaboration/communications). With outright bans by many states disallowing UAV use in any situation related to hunting and wildlife harassment, PPCs are considered by some to be a more animal-friendly and cost-effective alternative.

==History==
In 1930, a cover article in Modern Mechanix, October issue, described the project of Buddy Bushmeyer for a powered parachute. the concept of a &quot;powered parachute&quot; was born, and is a contributing reason why the sport is called powered parachuting, despite the fact that it actually uses a parafoil.

After World War II, sport jumping became a recreational activity, and started with the round parachutes available at that time, ranging in size from 20 to 30 feet in diameter.

On October 1, 1964, Domina Jalbert applied for a patent for his new &quot;Multi-Cell Wing&quot; he named a &quot;parafoil&quot; (also known as a &quot;ram-air&quot; wing), which was a new parachute design. His ideas were registered as U.S. patent 3,285,546 on November 15, 1966.

The possibilities of Jalbert&#x27;s design quickly became apparent: because the parafoil formed a wing shape upon inflation, increased glide ratios were possible and the distance traveled could likely be extended, assuming the person or payload suspended under the chute had some thrust added. With even more power, the angle of attack could be shifted, and the wing could fly level or even climb.

In 1968, Lowell Farrand attempted just this, and flew a motorized version called the “Irish Flyer I”, developed by Dr. John Nicolaides at Notre Dame University. It was a modified standard Benson gyrocopter, with the rotor removed and replaced by a 6-foot cross-member to which the parafoil was attached. The propeller was shrouded in order to avoid entanglement with the parafoil lines. Irish Flyer I was tested in the summer of 1968 by towing it aloft and releasing it for extended powered glides. Over the proceeding years, additional tow-based prototypes were developed and flown.

Unfortunately, heavy engines, as well as limitations in the availability of strong and light parafoil and frame materials, contributed to making the concept difficult to execute.

The later development of the first mass-produced powered parachute took approximately two and one-half years.

Aeronautical engineer Steve Snyder was implementing and perfecting the use of the square ram-air parafoils, and decided to pursue the idea and objective of creating a safe and simple aircraft that even amateurs could launch and fly easily.

The first powered parachute that could take off under its own power flew in 1981 when Steve Snyder, Dan Thompson, and Adrian Vandenburg combined their talents and inspiration. It was Snyder&#x27;s idea to take skydiving&#x27;s newest parafoil designs and add newer (and lighter) engines, while Vandenburg&#x27;s skills as a machinist were critical to building the cockpit frame that was completed in March 1981. Daniel Thompson, an ultralight-aircraft designer and small-engine mechanic, was brought onto the project three months later to identify a power plant for the aircraft. He fitted the aircraft with two small Chrysler engines, resulting in the first prototype P-1 aircraft.

On the first day of test flight, attempts were made to simply get the PPC off the ground. Snyder, at 150 lbs., finally tried easing the power away from full throttle at take-off, and managed to fly the craft to a height of 40 to 50 feet. Snyder had a difficult time controlling the aircraft because of the torque produced by both engines&#x27; propellers spinning in the same direction. The total flight time was 30–35 seconds at a speed of 20 to 25 mph. The P-1 flew more than 10 times, once by a woman weighing 110 lbs., which allowed for better performance of the test flights. Many revisions were made during those test flights, including the addition of a vertical stabilizer, flaps, ailerons, and optimization of the parafoil trim.

Ram air parafoils of the day had a flat profile and offered limited control. As a result, a more anhedral (downward curve) design was applied and ribs were added to the parafoil, ultimately giving the aircraft more stability and pressurization and solving the control issue.

As the parafoil design and control solutions were being worked out, Thompson developed an improved airframe design, including Snyder&#x27;s idea of folding landing gear for portability. The problem of torque was resolved by having the propellers counter-rotating, thus canceling out each other&#x27;s torque effect. The P-2 aircraft was completed in January 1983.

Design and construction of the P-3 started on February 26, 1983. Three months later the prototype made its debut at the Sun &amp; Fun Airshow in Florida. Response was overwhelming, and the ParaPlane Corporation was formed to produce the first commercially viable P-3 powered parachute. Since that time, many innovations and improvements have developed.

<text>The indigenous peoples of Western New Guinea in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, commonly called Papuans, are Melanesians. There is genetic evidence for two major historical lineages in New Guinea and neighboring islands: a first wave from the Malay Archipelago perhaps 50,000 years ago when New Guinea and Australia were a single landmass called Sahuland, much later, a wave of Austronesian people from the north who introduced Austronesian languages and pigs about 3,500 years ago. They also left a small but significant genetic trace in many coastal Papuan peoples.

Linguistically, Papuans speak languages from the many families of non-Austronesian languages that are found only on New Guinea and neighboring islands, as well as Austronesian languages along parts of the coast, and recently developed creoles such as Tok Pisin, Hiri Motu, Unserdeutsch, and Papuan Malay.

The term &quot;Papuan&quot; is used in a wider sense in linguistics and anthropology. In linguistics, &quot;Papuan languages&quot; is a cover term for the diverse, mutually unrelated, non-Austronesian language families spoken in Melanesia, the Torres Strait Islands, and parts of Wallacea. In anthropology, &quot;Papuan&quot; is often used to denote the highly diverse aboriginal populations of Melanesia and Wallacea prior to the arrival of Austronesian-speakers, and the dominant genetic traces of these populations in the current ethnic groups of these areas.
==Languages==
&quot;Ethnologue&quot;″s 14th edition lists 826 languages of Papua New Guinea and 257 languages of Western New Guinea, a total of 1083 languages, with 12 languages overlapping. They can be divided into two groups, the Austronesian languages, and all the others, called Papuan languages for convenience. The term &quot;Papuan languages&quot; refers to an areal grouping, rather than a linguistic one. So-called Papuan languages comprise hundreds of different languages, most of which are not related.

==Origin and genetics==

The origin of Papuans is generally associated with the first settlement of Australasia by a lineage dubbed &#x27;Australasians&#x27; or &#x27;Australo-Papuans&#x27; during the Initial Upper Paleolithic, which is &quot;ascribed to a population movement with uniform genetic features and material culture&quot; (Ancient East Eurasians), and sharing deep ancestry with modern East Asian peoples and other Asia-Pacific groups. It is estimated that people reached Sahul (the geological continent consisting of Australia and New Guinea) between 50,000 and 37,000 years ago. Rising sea levels separated New Guinea from Australia about 10,000 years ago. However, Aboriginal Australians and Papuans had diverged genetically much earlier, around 40,000 years BP. Papuans are more closely related to Melanesians than to Aboriginal Australians.

=== Haplogroups ===
The majority of Papuan Y-DNA Haplogroups belong to subclades of HaplogroupMS, and HaplogroupC1b2a. The frequency of each haplogroup varies along geographic clines.

=== Autosomal DNA ===
The genetic makeup of Papuans is primarily derived from Ancient East Eurasians, which relates them to other mainland Asian groups such as the &quot;AASI&quot;, Andamanese, as well as East/Southeast Asians, although Papuans may have also received some gene flow from an earlier group (xOoA), around 2%, next to additional archaic Denisovan admixture in the Sahul region. Papuans may habor varying degrees of deep admixture from &quot;a lineage basal to West and East-Eurasians which occurred sometimes between 45 and 38kya&quot;, although they are generally regarded &quot;as a simple sister group of Tianyuan&quot; (&quot;Basal East Asians&quot;).
There is evidence that the ancestors of Papuans and related groups &quot;underwent a strong bottleneck before the settlement of the region, and separated around 20,000–40,000 years ago&quot;.

Papuans display pronounced genetic diversity, explained through isolation and drift between different subgroups after the settlement of New Guinea. The most notable differentiation was found to be between Highlanders and Lowlanders. Papuan Highlanders fall into three clusters, but form a single clade compared against Lowlanders. The Highlanders underwent a population bottleneck around 10,000 years ago, associated with the adoption of Neolithic lifestyles. Papuan Lowlanders display increased diversity and can be broadly differentiated into a Southern Lowlander cluster and a Northern Lowlander cluster. The genetic differentiation among Papuans is suggested to date back at least 20kya, while the sub-structure among Highlanders dates back around 10kya, with higher diversity among western Highlanders than Eastern ones. The genetic diversity is paralleled by linguistic and cultural diversity.

=== Archaic introgression ===
Based on his genetic studies of the Denisova hominin, an ancient human species discovered in 2010, Svante Pääbo claims that ancient human ancestors of the Papuans interbred in Asia with these humans. He has found that people of New Guinea share 4%–7% of their genome with the Denisovans, indicating this exchange. Denisovan introgressions may have influenced the immune system of present-day Papuans and potentially favoured &quot;variants to immune-related phenotypes&quot; and &quot;adaptation to the local environment&quot;.

=== ASPM gene ===
In a 2005 study of ASPM gene variants, Mekel-Bobrov et al. found that the Papuan people have among the highest rate of the newly evolved ASPM HaplogroupD, at 59.4% occurrence of the approximately 6,000-year-old allele. While it is not yet known exactly what selective advantage is provided by this gene variant, the haplogroupD allele is thought to be positively selected in populations and to confer some substantial advantage that has caused its frequency to rapidly increase.

<text>Charles Zeller Klauder (February 9, 1872 – October 30, 1938) was an American architect best known for his work on university buildings and campus designs, especially his Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh, the first educational skyscraper.

==Biography==

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Klauder was the son of Louis and Anna Koehler Klauder, who had immigrated to Philadelphia from Germany. He studied architecture at the School of Industrial Art at the Pennsylvania Museum. At age 15, he entered the office of Theophilus Parsons Chandler Jr. Beginning in 1893 he worked for prominent Philadelphia architectural firms, including Wilson Brothers &amp; Company, Cope &amp; Stewardson, and Horace Trumbauer. In 1900, Klauder became chief draughtsman for Frank Miles Day &amp; Brother, which led to a 1911 partnership, and the firm&#x27;s eventual renaming as Day &amp; Klauder. Klauder continued the firm after Day&#x27;s 1918 death.

Klauder teamed with the English-born Day to design some of the nation&#x27;s most influential and distinguished campus buildings during the heyday of university expansion in the early 20th century. Along with Cope &amp; Stewardson, Day &amp; Klauder may be credited with the invention of the Collegiate Gothic idiom in American architecture. Their early work at Princeton and Cornell universities set the standard for dormitory and classroom designs in the Ivy League. Klauder extended the Gothic idiom during the 1920s to incorporate elements of Art Deco abstraction and modern building technology. He created campus plans for the University of Colorado (1917) in Boulder, St Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, NH, Pennsylvania State University at University Park, and Concordia Seminary in St Louis, MO. His work at Princeton included dining halls (1913), Dickinson Hall (1929), dormitories (1921), the Holder group (1928), and the university&#x27;s second library (1927).

Several of his landmark Neo-Gothic buildings at the University of Pittsburgh are the Cathedral of Learning, Heinz Memorial Chapel and the Stephen Foster Memorial. The Cathedral of Learning, upon its completion, was the tallest educational building in the world, and today it ranks behind only a tower at Moscow University. It is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Marks Scout Resource Center at 22nd and Winter Streets in Philadelphia was built in 1929. Klauder designed the building in the Beaux Arts style.

Klauder considered his greatest achievement to be the Commons Room of the Cathedral of Learning. The Commons Room is a fifteenth-century English perpendicular Gothic-style hall that covers half an acre (2,000 m2) and extends upwards four stories, reaching tall.

For his lifelong architectural work, Klauder has received the gold medal, Architectural League, N.Y. 1921; Grand Prix Pan American Congress of Architects, 1927; Architectural Medal, Olympic Games, 1928. Klauder was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. In 1938 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.

Klauder died aged 66 on October 30, 1938. His remains are interred at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

<text>Forensic medicine is a broad term used to describe a group of medical specialties which deal with the examination and diagnosis of individuals who have been injured by or who have died because of external or unnatural causes such as poisoning, assault, suicide and other forms of violence, and apply findings to law (i.e. court cases). Forensic medicine is a multi-disciplinary branch which includes the practice of forensic pathology, forensic psychiatry, forensic odontology, forensic radiology and forensic toxicology. There are two main categories of forensic medicine; Clinical forensic medicine; Pathological forensics medicine, with the differing factor being the condition of the patients. In clinical forensic medicine it is the investigation of trauma to living patients, whereas pathological forensic medicine involves the examination of traumas to the deceased to find the cause of death.

== History ==
The term clinical forensic medicine, coined by Thomas Stuart, dates back to the 19th century, referring to the connection between the usage of medical evidence for judiciary purposes. Although this form of forensics medicine has been used before this term was conceived. However, clinical forensics could not be considered a thing until both legal and medical systems were well developed. But, there has been evidence of some form of forensics as far back as 220B.C.E., in the Qin Dynasty, where evidence of linking medical and legal systems were written out. Forensic medicine emerged as a discipline in France in the late 18th century.

Pathological forensic medicine was not considered as its own subfield until 1819, when Joan Lobstein was appointed the position of Professorship of Pathology at the University of Strassburg. However, forensic pathology has been used throughout history to determine cause all factors of a death (e.g. mechanism, etc.) by examining the body of the deceased. Autopsies of animals were conducted as early as 400 B.C.E. Until the 13th century the body of the deceased were considered holy and could not be operated on. However, around 1231 C.E. the first law that allowed for the dissection and observation of a human body. This led to further easing on the concept of human autopsies, as more and more occurred. This development led to many advancements in pathology as the human body was properly mapped for its structure and function, and studied for the causes of diseases. This led to the overall increase in health as ancient technique were rid of, and new scientific medical practices were implemented.

<doc id="1031469" wikidata="Q2838542" url="?curid=1031469" title="Zubir Said">
<text>Zubir Said ( ; 22 July 1907 – 16 November 1987) was a Singaporean composer most notable for composing the national anthem of his country, &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot; – &quot;Onward Singapore&quot;. 

A self-taught musician, Zubir also worked as a score arranger and songwriter for Cathay Organisation&#x27;s Keris Film Productions for 12 years, composing numerous songs for the company&#x27;s Malay Singaporean films. He is believed to have written up to 1,500 songs, with less than 10% of them ever recorded.

==Early years==
The eldest child in a family of three boys and five girls, Zubir was born on 22 July 1907 in Bukit Tinggi, Minangkabau, Sumatra, Indonesia. His mother died when he was seven years old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music started when he was introduced to the Solfa music system by a teacher. A primary-school classmate subsequently taught him how to make and play a flute, and in middle school, he learned to play the guitar and drums from fellow students and the &quot;keroncong&quot; group he was involved in.

==Move to Singapore==
In 1928 at the age of 21, Zubir went to Singapore to make a living as a musician, taking up the suggestion of a sailor friend who had described the island as a place of &quot;glittering lights, seller [coffee with milk] and butter&quot;. This was done in the face of objections from his village chieftain father, Mohamad Said bin Sanang, who believed music to be against religion. Zubir&#x27;s first job was as a musician with City Opera, a &quot;bangsawan&quot; or Malay opera troupe based in Tanjong Pagar. He became the troupe&#x27;s bandleader. Thereafter, in 1936, he joined the recording company His Master&#x27;s Voice. Zubir went to Java to marry Tarminah Kario Wikromo, a &quot;keroncong&quot; singer, in 1938; they returned to Zubir&#x27;s home town of Bukittinggi in 1941 just before the outbreak of World War II. 

Coming back to Singapore in 1947, Zubir worked as a part-time photographer with the &quot;Utusan Melayu&quot; newspaper while composing and performing music and songs. In 1949 he took up the post of orchestra conductor at Shaw Brothers&#x27; Malay Film Production, and in 1952 he joined Cathay-Keris Film Productions as a score arranger and songwriter for the company&#x27;s Malay films, including &quot;Sumpah Pontianak&quot; (&quot;Blood of Pontianak&quot;, 1958) and &quot;Chuchu Datuk Merah&quot; (&quot;Grandchildren of Datuk Merah&quot;, 1963). In 1957, he received his first public recognition when his songs were performed at the Victoria Theatre.

==&quot;Majulah Singapura&quot;==

Singapore, then a British colony, had been conferred city status by a royal charter from King George VI in 1951. In 1958, the City Council of Singapore approached Zubir to compose a song for the city to be titled &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot;, which was a motto to be displayed in the Victoria Theatre after its renovation. Zubir&#x27;s song, &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot; (&quot;Onward Singapore&quot;), was first performed by the Singapore Chamber Ensemble during the grand finale of a concert staged in the Victoria Theatre on 6 September 1958 to celebrate its official reopening. When Singapore attained self-government in 1959, the Government felt that a national anthem was needed to unite the different races in Singapore. 

It decided that the City Council&#x27;s song, which was already popular, would serve this purpose. After some revisions were made to the song, it was adopted by the Legislative Assembly on 11 November 1959, and on 30 November the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed. This statute regulated the use and display of the State Arms and State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem. &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot; was presented to the nation on 3 December at the launch of &quot;Loyalty Week&quot;, replacing the colonial anthem &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. After Singapore&#x27;s full independence from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot; was formally adopted as the Republic&#x27;s national anthem. In a 1984 oral history interview, to sum up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb &quot;&quot; (&quot;You should hold up the sky of the land where you live&quot;).

==Later years==
In 1962, Zubir&#x27;s songs for the movie &quot;Dang Anom&quot; won an award at the ninth Asian Film Festival in Seoul, South Korea. 

He also gave music lessons, and often had other music artists visiting him to talk about music and asking for advice. His third and youngest daughter Puan Sri Dr. Rohana Zubir, a retired lecturer with the University of Malaya, recalled how the family home in Singapore was always filled with music. He was the heart of the conversation, very enthused and willing to share pearls of wisdom so that others could benefit from his work. This generosity extended to other areas of his life. He helped his own family in Sumatra and families in Singapore he had &quot;adopted&quot;, sending them medicine and other items with what little he could afford, even though his own family was not well off at the time.

He was content with money earned from those lessons and his film compositions; affirming that he was never driven by money although essential for his own and family&#x27;s survival, rather he valued honesty and sincerity in his work and placed importance on purity and originality, whether in his music, lyrics or style of singing. He continued working for Cathay-Keris Film Productions until he retired in 1964, composing numerous songs for Malay films. Some sources reported that he also stopped composing songs for Cathay out of objection to its management&#x27;s decision to cut production costs by borrowing existing music to be used for dubbing onto the background music of some films at the time.

Zubir died at the age of 80 on 16 November 1987 at Joo Chiat Place in Singapore, survived by four daughters and a son. At the time of his death, Zubir left S$20,000 to his name. In 1990, his life and passion as a musician were documented in a book titled &quot;Zubir Said: His Songs&quot;, and in 2004 a S$69,000 bronze bust of a bespectacled Zubir was installed in Gallery 6 of the Malay Heritage Centre which pays tribute to icons in Singaporean Malay arts and culture.

==Awards and honours==
Zubir receives dozens of awards and honours from in and outside of Singapore for his massive contributions to the Malay world in songs and music and to Singapore. Some of his awards and honours were not in the list below.
In recognition of his contributions to the State, Zubir was conferred the &quot;Sijil Kemuliaan&quot; (Certificate of Honour) on 16 March 1963 and the &quot;Bintang Bakti Masyarakat&quot; (Public Service Star) in the same year. In 1971, he received the &quot;Jasawan Seni&quot; (cultural medallion) award from eight Malay cultural organisations, and the Asean Cultural and Communications Award in 1987. He also received a Certificate of Commendation from the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE) for composing the AUPE song. In 1995, Zubir was posthumously given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Composers and Authors Society of Singapore (COMPASS).

On 8 May 2009, the Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Lui Tuck Yew, announced that the address of the permanent campus for the School of the Arts (SOTA) near The Cathay will be 1 Zubir Said Drive, in honour of the late composer.

==Music==
Zubir is estimated to have written about 1,500 songs, including those written for Cathay-Keris Film Productions&#x27; Malay films in the 1950s and 1960s; less than 10% of these songs were recorded. His compositions throughout his filmography were heavily influenced by Minangkabau music, his past involvement with the bangsawan scene as well as influences of Indian classical music and Malay &quot;irama asli&quot;. However, with the decline of Malay cinema in Singapore, he is primarily remembered by Singaporeans for several patriotic compositions: its national anthem, &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot; (&quot;Onward Singapore&quot;), and &quot;Semoga Bahagia&quot; (&quot;May You Achieve Happiness&quot;), a song aimed at primary-school students often sung in schools for Children&#x27;s Dayon 1 October plus during the Singapore Youth Festival.

He had also submitted three song compositions to the Malayan – later Malaysian – Government for consideration for their national anthem in 1956. However, the committee eventually decided upon selecting a traditional folk song (based upon the French songwriter Pierre-Jean de Béranger&#x27;s &quot;La Rosalie&quot;) to what would eventually became Malaysia&#x27;s own &quot;Negaraku&quot;.

On 22 August 2007, Zubir&#x27;s family signed an agreement with Universal Music in Malaysia for the latter to manage his works while the copyright in the songs remains with his family. The idea to do so came after his daughter Dr. Rohana met Sandy Monteiro, senior ASEAN vice-president of the Universal Music Publishing Group in 2005 through Monteiro&#x27;s wife, who was a good friend of hers. Dr. Rohana was reported as saying: &quot;It is time to hand over the songs in order to revive them two decades after my father&#x27;s passing. I hope to ensure that his songs continue to live in the hearts of young artists in Malaysia.&quot;

<doc id="1031478" wikidata="Q423034" url="?curid=1031478" title="Glauconite">
<text>Glauconite is an iron potassium phyllosilicate (mica group) mineral of characteristic green color which is very friable and has very low weathering resistance.

It crystallizes with a monoclinic geometry. Its name is derived from the Greek () meaning &#x27;bluish green&#x27;, referring to the common blue-green color of the mineral; its sheen (mica glimmer) and blue-green color. Its color ranges from olive green, black green to bluish green, and yellowish on exposed surfaces due to oxidation. In the Mohs scale it has a hardness of 2, roughly the same as gypsum. The relative specific gravity range is 2.4–2.95. It is normally found as dark green rounded concretions with the dimensions of a sand grain. It can be confused with chlorite (also of green color) or with a clay mineral. Glauconite has the chemical formula .

Glauconite particles are one of the main components of greensand, glauconitic siltstone and glauconitic sandstone. Glauconite has been called a marl in an old and broad sense of that word. Thus references to &quot;greensand marl&quot; sometimes refer specifically to glauconite. The Glauconitic Marl formation is named after it, and there is a glauconitic sandstone formation in the Mannville Group of Western Canada.

== Occurrence ==
At the broadest level, glauconite is an authigenic mineral and forms exclusively in marine settings. It is commonly associated with low-oxygen conditions.

Normally, glauconite is considered a diagnostic mineral indicative of continental shelf marine depositional environments with slow rates of accumulation and gradational boundaries. For instance, it appears in Jurassic/lower Cretaceous deposits of greensand, so-called after the coloration caused by glauconite, its presence gradually lessening further landward. It can also be found in sand or clay formations, or in impure limestones and in chalk. It develops as a consequence of diagenetic alteration of sedimentary deposits at the surface, bio-chemical reduction and subsequent mineralogical changes affecting iron-bearing micas such as biotite, and is also influenced by the decaying process of organic matter degraded by bacteria in marine animal shells. In these cases, the organic matter creates the reducing environment needed to form glauconite within otherwise oxygenated sediment. Glauconite deposits are commonly found in nearshore sands, open oceans and shallow seas, such as the Mediterranean Sea. Glauconite remains absent in fresh-water lakes, but is noted in shelf sediments of the western Black Sea. The wide distribution of these sandy deposits was first made known by naturalists on board the fifth HMS &quot;Challenger&quot;, in the expedition of 1872–1876.

==Uses==
Glauconite has long been used in Europe as a green pigment for artistic oil paint under the name green earth. One example is its use in Russian &quot;icon paintings&quot;, another widespread use was for underpainting of human flesh in medieval painting. It is also found as mineral pigment in wall paintings from the ancient Roman Gaul.

=== Fertilizers ===
Glauconite, a major component of greensand, is a common source of potassium (K+) in plant fertilizers and is also used to adjust soil pH. It is used for soil conditioning in both organic and non-organic farming, whether as an unprocessed material (mixed in adequate proportions) or as a feedstock in the synthesis of commercial fertilizer powders. In Brazil, greensand refers to a fertilizer produced from a glauconitic siltstone unit belonging to the Serra da Saudade Formation, Bambuí Group, of Neoproterozoic/Ediacaran age. The outcrops occur in the Serra da Saudade ridge, in the Alto Paranaíba region, Minas Gerais state. It is a silty-clayed sedimentary rock, laminated, bluish-green, composed of glauconite (40-80%), potassium feldspar (10-15%), quartz (10-60%), muscovite (5%) and minor quantities of biotite (2%), goethite (&lt;1%), titanium and manganese oxides (&lt;1%), barium phosphate and rare-earth element phosphates (&lt;1%).

Enriched levels of potash have K2O grades between 8 and 12%, thickness up to and are associated to the glauconitic levels, dark-green in color. Glauconite is authigenic and highly mature. The high concentration of this mineral is related to a depositional environment with a low sedimentation rate. The glauconitic siltstone has resulted from a high-level flooding event in the Bambuí Basin. The sedimentary is from supracrustal felsic elements in a continental margin environment with acid magmatic arc (foreland basin).

==Hazards==
In the wind farm industry off the coasts of Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey, glauconite-rich sands of Cretaceous to Paleogene age found in the seabed have become a hazard to the installation of monopiles used for turbine foundation. When these sands are manipulated, during the driving of monopiles, they start to crush, changing their geotechnical behaviour from sand-like to clay-like, with the risk of pile refusal, making it impossible to reach the target depth of the piles. The pile driving difficulties stem from the high frictional resistance of the native glauconite sand at the pile tip, combined with the high cohesive resistance of the altered, now clay-like material along the pile shaft.

<doc id="1031481" wikidata="Q285331" url="?curid=1031481" title="Ronald Cerritos">
<text>Ronald Osvaldo Cerritos Flores (born January 3, 1975) is a Salvadoran former professional footballer who played as a striker.

Cerritos was once the all-time leader in assists of the Major League Soccer team, the San Jose Earthquakes, with 47. He has since been surpassed by Shea Salinas and the current leader, Cristian Espinoza.

==Club career==
Cerritos has spent the bulk of his career playing in MLS, being signed by the league on March 21, 1997, and allocated to the San Jose Clash. While with San Jose he achieved great success, being named in the MLS Best XI in his first year with the club. In the offseason after 2001, however, Cerritos was traded to the Dallas Burn for Ariel Graziani. He never was able to settle in Dallas, having trouble earning a starting spot, and struggling with injuries.

After a year and a half at Dallas, during which he scored seven goals, Cerritos was traded to D.C. United for Ali Curtis and a first-round pick in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. Cerritos again was largely unproductive in D.C. and was cut midway through the 2004 season because his performances were not justifying his large salary, and returned to play for Alianza in his native El Salvador. After the season with Alianza he returned to MLS and his original team, with San Jose acquiring him from DC for a draft pick. During his returning season, Cerritos scored an additional 6 goals. He is 2nd on San Jose&#x27;s all-time scoring list, with 61 goals and also has the honor of having the most assists, with 47. Shortly after his return to the Earthquakes, however, Cerritos was moved to Houston for the 2006 season along with his teammates. Despite his success with San Jose his resulting stint with the Houston Dynamo was short-lived, as he was released in August 2006.

He was later signed by San Salvador F.C. on a two-year deal and became an outstanding performer week in and week out, soon being recalled to the El Salvador national team to participate in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup in the United States.

In November 2007, Cerritos signed a two-year contract with expansion Real Maryland FC USL Second Division. He played fifteen games, scoring two goals, but was released by the team after their 6–0 loss to the Richmond Kickers, a game in which he did not play. On July 31, 2008, Cerritos signed with the Carolina RailHawks of the USL First Division. He finished the season with the RailHawks, but was not signed by the team for the 2009 season.

At half time of the match between the San Jose Earthquakes and Chicago Fire on September 29, 2010, Cerritos became the second player inducted into the San Jose Earthquakes Hall of Fame.

==International career==
Cerritos has been a mainstay in the El Salvador national team, having made over 60 appearances. He made his debut for the national team against the USA on 5 December 1993 and scored his first goal for El Salvador in a 3–2 victory over Trinidad and Tobago on January 10, 1996, in a 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup match.

On March 5, 2000, in a FIFA World Cup qualification match against Belize, Cerritos scored El Salvador&#x27;s 400th goal in all senior international matches.

==Personal life==
Cerritos is Married to Brenda Cerritos, Cerritos son, Alexis Cerritos, is also a professional footballer who plays for the El Salvador national football team.

In his spare time, Cerritos enjoys playing cards and playing basketball with his friends. He enjoys spending time with his two sons. He currently lives Maryland.

He now has his own Soccer Club named Cerritos Soccer Academy, youth kids from 5–19 years old.

<text>Burnt Pine (Norf&#x27;k: &quot;Ban Pain&quot;) is the largest town on Norfolk Island, an Australian external territory located in the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand. It is the main commercial hub of the island, and travel from one side of the island to another generally involves passing through Burnt Pine as the island&#x27;s sole thoroughfare runs through the town&#x27;s centre.

==Geography==
The town is located on a roughly east–west-aligned ridge of volcanic soils, about above sea level. The headwaters of Cascade Creek and Broken Bridge Creek (northern side) and Watermill Creek (southern side) flow from just below the ridge.

==History==
In 1795, First Fleeter Andrew Goodwin was granted a prime sixty-acre lot (lot 64) on Middlegate and Queen Elizabeth Roads Norfolk Island, where he lived with his wife Lydia (Letitia) Munro and his children until 1802. A map of 1844 labels the area &#x27;Sheep Station&#x27;, and a 1904 map shows the area as large rural holdings. The impetus for founding the town came in 1942 during the Pacific War, when construction of a military aerodrome began (now the Norfolk Island Airport). This involved the destruction of the convict-planted Pine Avenue for the east–west runway. Between 1943 and 1944, the Army produced the &quot;Burnt Pine News&quot;, the first eponymous use of the place name. By the end of the war, a number of shops and a new hospital had been built around the intersection of Taylors Road and Grassy Road (the original location of the name Burnt Pine), and in 1946, Rawson Hall was built in Taylors Road. Regular commercial air services from 1946 onwards brought a gradual increase in tourism, and Burnt Pine was well placed on the airport edge for siting new guest houses and shops, such as Holloway&#x27;s &#x27;Sample Rooms&#x27;, a tea shop that operated on a rise in Taylors Road known as Holloways Hill. A new hospital was built in 1952 on the Grassy Road corner. The expansion of the town matched the growth of the tourism industry. Development spread eastwards along Taylors Road: Prentice&#x27;s duty-free shop opened on Taylors Road in 1953, as did the &#x27;Leeside&#x27; store near the New Cascade Road corner. The tourist boom started in the mid-1960s, and as the town spread, the name Burnt Pine followed and now refers to the whole urbanised area.

== Urban layout ==
The town has a ribbon development form strung along Taylors Road, with its boundaries marked by cattle grids on Taylors Road, New Cascade Road, Grassy Road, Douglas Drive and Ferny Lane. Central Taylors Road around the intersection with New Cascade Road forms the town&#x27;s High Street or CBD and contains its major infrastructure. Shops, cafes, offices, service clubs, several tourist resort complexes and a few residential properties line both sides of the street. The Bicentennial Complex on Taylors Road contains the main public buildings (Visitor Centre, Post Office, Customs &amp; Immigration Offices and Liquor Bond Store), Rawson Hall and the Lions Park sports grounds and oval. Other public buildings are the Norfolk Island Hospital on Grassy Road and the Norfolk Telecom Offices on New Cascade Road. There are no real side streets or blocks below the ridge. Taylors Road merges into Douglas Drive and the Norfolk Island Airport marking the western edge of the town. The town&#x27;s buildings mainly date from the 1970s and 1980s and are mainly single storied, sitting low in the landscape.

==Population==
Census population figures are not available for the various districts of Norfolk Island. The population of Burnt Pine was estimated to be in 2007.

== Municipal governance ==
There is no level of municipal governance in Norfolk Island, and the town has no formal boundaries. The Chamber of Commerce provides an avenue for involvement by business people in lobbying the Territory government for improved facilities and maintenance of public spaces. The town has no distinctive emblems or heraldry.

== Nearby towns and hamlets ==
Kingston, the capital of Norfolk Island and main landing place, is about to the south. Middlegate, the site of Norfolk Island Central School, is a hamlet on the eastern fringe of Burnt Pine. Middlegate&#x27;s main street is Queen Elizabeth Avenue, running from Taylors Road to the Middlegate Crossroads. The school is located at the crossroads, as is the Bounty Folk Museum, formerly Uncle Joe Jenkins General Store. Several tourist resorts have a Queen Elizabeth Avenue address whereas the main public space is the Queen Victoria Gardens. Cascade, the secondary landing place, with no buildings other than a pier and weighbridge and the ruins of an old whaling station, is about to the north of the town.

<doc id="1031496" wikidata="Q30678285" url="?curid=1031496" title="Pocket (military)">
<text>A pocket is a group of combat forces that have been isolated by opposing forces from their logistical base and other friendly forces. In mobile warfare, such as blitzkrieg, salients were more likely to be cut off into pockets, which became the focus of battles of annihilation.

The term &quot;pocket&quot; carries connotations that the encirclement was not intentionally allowed by the encircled forces, as it may have been when defending a fortified position, which is usually called a siege. That is a similar distinction to that made between a skirmish and pitched battle.

==Implementation==
===Soviet military doctrine===
Soviet military doctrine distinguishes several sizes of encirclement:

* Cauldron or kettle (; ): a very large, strategic-level concentration of trapped enemy forces
* Sack (; ): an operational-level trapped enemy force
* Nest (; ): a tactical-level trapped enemy force

The significance of these terms are reflected by the conception of what can be expected in combat in encirclement operations. A cauldron is expected to be &quot;boiling&quot; with combat activity, the large enemy forces still quite able to offer &quot;hot&quot; resistance in the initial stages of encirclement, and so are to be contained, but not engaged directly. A sack in Soviet experience was often created as a result of operational breakthroughs, and was sometimes as unexpected for the Soviet command as for the enemy. This encirclement, sometimes of an entity of unknown size, tended to move for some time after the initial encirclement due to inherently dynamic nature of operational warfare. By contrast a nest was a reference to a tactical, well-defined and contained encirclement of enemy troops that was seen as a fragile construct of enemy troops unsupported by its parent formation (the use of the word nest is similar to the more familiar English expression &quot;machine gun nest&quot;).

===Kessel===
In German the word &quot;Kessel&quot; (cognate with kettle) is commonly used to refer to an encircled military force, and a &quot;Kesselschlacht&quot; (&quot;cauldron battle&quot;) refers to a pincer movement. The common tactic which would leave a &quot;Kessel&quot; is referred to as &quot;Keil und Kessel&quot; (&quot;Keil&quot; meaning &quot;wedge&quot;). &quot;Kessel&quot; is a loanword in English texts about World War II. Another use of &quot;Kessel&quot; is &quot;Kessel fever&quot;, the panic and hopelessness felt by any troops who were surrounded with little or no chance of escape.

&#x27;Kettling&#x27; is also used to refer to a police tactic in which police surround groups of protesters to contain their activities.

===Cerco===
In Spanish the word &quot;Cerco&quot; (literally a fence or siege) is commonly used to refer to an encircling military force. &quot;Cercos&quot; were particularly common in the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay (1932–1935) and encirclement battles were decisive for the outcome of the war. In the Campo Vía pocket 7,500 Bolivians were taken prisoner out of an initial combat force of 10,000. Other &quot;cercos&quot; of the war include the battle of Campo Grande and the battle of Cañada Strongest.

===Motti===
Motti is Finnish military slang for a totally encircled enemy unit. The tactic of encircling is called motitus, literally meaning the formation of an isolated block or &quot;motti&quot;, but in effect meaning an &quot;entrapment&quot; or &quot;envelopment&quot;.

The word means &quot;mug&quot; in many Finnish dialects; an alternate translation refers to a cubic meter of firewood, a relatively small area in which an encircled enemy could be &quot;cut down&quot; like trees. &quot;motti&quot; is thus related to &quot;kessel&quot;. A &quot;motti&quot; in military tactics therefore means the formation of &quot;bite sized&quot; enemy units which are easier to contain and deal with.

This tactic of envelopment was used extensively by the Finnish forces in the Winter War and the Continuation War to good effect. It was especially effective against some of the mechanized units of the Soviet Army, which were effectively restricted to the long and narrow forest roads with virtually no way other than forwards or backwards. Once committed to a road, the Soviet troops effectively were trapped. Unlike the mechanized units of the Soviets, the Finnish troops could move quickly through the forests on skis and break columns of armoured Soviet units into smaller chunks (e.g., by felling trees along the road). Once the large column was split up into smaller armoured units, the Finnish forces attacking from within the forest could strike the weakened column. The smaller pockets of enemy troops could then be dealt with individually by concentrating forces on all sides against the entrapped unit.

A &quot;motitus&quot; is therefore a double envelopment manoeuvre, using the ability of light troops to travel over rough ground to encircle enemy troops on a road. Heavily outnumbered but mobile forces could easily immobilize an enemy many times more numerous.

By cutting the enemy columns or units into smaller groups and then encircling them with light and mobile forces, such as ski-troops during winter, a smaller force can overwhelm a much larger force. If the encircled enemy unit was too strong, or if attacking it would have entailed an unacceptably high cost, e.g., because of a lack of heavy equipment, the &quot;motti&quot; was usually left to &quot;stew&quot; until it ran out of food, fuel, supplies, and ammunition and was weakened enough to be eliminated. Some of the larger mottis held out until the end of the war because they were resupplied by air. Being trapped, however, these units were not available for battle operations.

The largest motti battles in the Winter War occurred at the Battle of Suomussalmi. Three Finnish regiments enveloped and destroyed two Soviet divisions as well as a tank brigade trapped on a road.

==Notable pockets==

===In World War II===
*In the winter of 1939–1940, Finnish troops encircled in a series of coordinated assaults approx. 50,000 Red army soldiers in the Battle of Suomussalmi with Soviet casualties exceeding over 30,000, while Finnish casualties stayed relatively low, approx. 1,000 soldiers (estimates vary). Escaping Red army soldiers abandoned hundreds of weapons and vehicles which were later used by the Finnish forces.
*From June to December 1941, during Operation Barbarossa,
**Almost the entire Soviet Western Front of over 420,000 was encircled and destroyed by the German Army Group Centre in the Battle of Bialystok-Minsk.
**Later, 310,000 Soviet troops were captured in a pocket at Smolensk when isolated by the Panzer forces of Generals Heinz Guderian and Hermann Hoth on August 5, 1941.
**During the Siege of Odessa, German and Romanian forces encircled and captured tens of thousands of Soviet troops.
**At the end, most of the Soviet Southwestern Front (about 700,000 soldiers) was encircled in the First Battle of Kiev.
*During the Battle of Moscow, over one million Soviet troops were encircled and destroyed in the opening phase, with 600,000–700,000 of them becoming prisoners, and the rest being killed.
*In the winter of 1942, 100,000 German Wehrmacht troops were encircled in the Demyansk Pocket in northwestern Russia, but were relieved the following spring.
*In the winter of 1942, 5,500 German troops were encircled by the Soviets in the Kholm Pocket.
*In the spring of 1942, 277,000 Soviet troops engaged in an offensive thrust were encircled during the German counterattack in the Second Battle of Kharkov.
*In November 1942, during the Battle of Stalingrad, nearly all of the German Sixth Army of over 250,000 men was encircled and destroyed in Operation Uranus. The Italian Army in Russia and the Hungarian Second Army were similarly eliminated during Operation Little Saturn.

<doc id="1031502" wikidata="Q3030006" url="?curid=1031502" title="Louis Buvelot">
<text>Louis Buvelot (3 March 1814 – 30 May 1888), born Abram-Louis Buvelot, was a Swiss landscape painter who lived 17 years in Brazil, and following 5 years back in Switzerland, stayed 23 years in Australia, where he influenced the Heidelberg School of painters.

==Early life==
Buvelot was born in Morges, Vaud, Switzerland, second son of François Simeon Buvelot, postal official, and his wife Jeanne-Louise &quot;née&quot; Heizer, a school teacher. Louis Buvelot (who disliked his first name and never used it) worked under Marc-Louis Arland at Lausanne, and from around 1834 continued his studies at Paris with Camille Flers, a well-known landscape painter of the day. After a few months there he migrated to Bahia, Brazil where he worked on his uncle&#x27;s coffee plantation. In October 1840 Buvelot moved to Rio de Janeiro and attracted the notice of the emperor Dom Pedro II, who bought some of his pictures and decorated him with the Order of the Rose. In November 1843 Buvelot married Marie-Félicité, &quot;née&quot; Lalouette (born 1816). Buvelot returned to Switzerland in 1852 and in 1856 was awarded a silver medal for a picture exhibited at Bern. Buvelot having lived in a warm country and finding the cold of Switzerland trying to his health left his family in La Chaux-de-Fonds and sailed from Liverpool bound for Melbourne, Australia in 1864 accompanied by Caroline-Julie Beguin, a teacher.

==Career in Australia==
Arriving in Melbourne in February 1865, Buvelot was in business as a photographer in Bourke Street for a year but soon resumed his painting. He lived for some years in Latrobe Street East, and then moved to George Street, Fitzroy. His new wife, Caroline-Julie Beguin, helped by teaching French, and presently he began to find buyers for his pictures, of whom James Smith was one of the earliest. In 1869 the trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria bought two of his pictures, and in 1870 paid £131 for the &quot;Waterpool at Coleraine&quot;. In 1873, 1880 and 1884 he was awarded gold medals at exhibitions held in Melbourne, and he also received a silver medal at the Philadelphia exhibition of 1876. His reputation became established, his only interest was his work, and he went on steadily painting until his death on 30 May 1888.

Buvelot died at his home on George St, Fitzroy. He was buried at the Boroondara Cemetery, where a large monument was erected in his memory.

==Legacy==

Buvelot&#x27;s widow, also an artist, died in 1902, there were no children. In July 1888 a memorial exhibition of his work was held at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and one of the galleries in that building was subsequently named after him.

Buvelot is best known for his great contribution to Australian art. His works, mostly oil landscapes, are quite well regarded, but perhaps his impact was even greater as a tutor of several members of the Heidelberg School, including Arthur Streeton, who named Buvelot&#x27;s 1866 painting &quot;Summer Evening Near Templestowe&quot; the &quot;first fine landscape painted in Victoria&quot;.

His enthusiasm for &quot;plein air&quot; painting (that is, painting directly in the open air) was a key characteristic of those artists&#x27; work.

<text>Henry Hellyer (1790 – September 1832) was an English surveyor and architect who was one of the first explorers to visit the rugged interior of the north west of Tasmania, Australia and made the most comprehensive maps of the area up to that time.

==Life==
Henry Hellyer was descended from Hellyers living in the area of Portsmouth in England. Nothing is known about his early life or where he was trained as an architect and surveyor, but it seems that the family were able to afford to educate their children well. His older brother William Varlo Hellyer was a lawyer in London and Secretary of the Royal Institution in 1841. A copy of a letter written by Henry in 1830 to William Varlo&#x27;s Hellyer&#x27;s wife, Mary Vuliamy was deposited by a Canadian descendant of William and Mary in the Hellyer Regional Library in Burnie, Tasmania. Henry himself had no direct descendants.

When the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company was formed in 1825 he was one of the first officers to sign on, as a surveyor (later Chief Surveyor) and Chief Architect. His achievements in Tasmania are well documented, and the Court of Directors of the VDL Co in London noted his resignation (March 1832) as follows: &quot;Mr Hellyer, whose valuable services have been so great and whose name is so well known both to the Colonial Government and at home, by his unwearied exertions for the company, by his personal privation and risk in exploring the country, and by the admirable maps and plans which have been exhibited, has been recently appointed to an important situation under the Surveyor-General of the Colony&quot;.

There are no portraits of Henry Hellyer. However, for the sesquicentenary of the town of Burnie in 1977, a portrait was created by local artist Casey McGrath from descriptions, and used as the basis for 200 silver medallions and 4,000 anodised aluminium ones that were given to school children in the area. A special issue of the local newspaper provided a detailed account of his life.

==Work in Tasmania==
Henry Hellyer explored most of North Western Tasmania for his employer, the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company (VDL Co), and wrote extensive journals and reports which are held in various archives. His best known journey was with Richard Frederick Isaac Cutts, from Circular Head to St Valentines Peak and back, in February 1827.

Overall, it seems clear that Henry Hellyer accepted the VDL Co view that their royal charter from King George IV made the Aboriginal people of North West Tasmania trespassers on company land. In August 1830, while building a footbridge over the River Wey, his camp at Weybridge was visited by George Augustus Robinson and the &quot;friendly mission&quot; whose intent was to investigate claims of killings, including the Cape Grim massacre by VDL Co employees, and to remove all Aboriginal people from their land and relocate them to an offshore island. The party that visited Hellyer&#x27;s camp included Truganini and her husband Woorady. Hellyer told Robinson of a stock-keeper who claimed to have killed 19 Aboriginal people with a swivel-gun and later wrote to his sister-in-law about Robinson&#x27;s visit, saying, &quot;I hope he will do some good, for at present a man&#x27;s life is not safe if he stirs out without arms, but I have hitherto been lucky enough to escape.&quot; This probably refers to an incident on 25 January 1829 which he described in a report as &quot;...a narrow escape, the natives having set fire to a thicket which we were struggling to get through. We rushed through the flames... We saw the natives with fire and tried to shoot them, but although not ten yards off they all escaped...&quot;

In 1831 he became the first European to reach the summit of Cradle Mountain. In the same year, he began the design of the residence, Highfield House, for the Chief Agent of the VDL Co, but he did not live to see it built. He committed suicide on the night of 1/2 September 1832, leaving a note which is held in the Tasmanian Archives.

Hellyer travelled extensively along the north of the island. Parts of his journey have been recorded by Brian J Rollins, who followed precisely parts of this journey. His article, &quot;Henry Hellyer, esquire, 1790/1832: Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company surveyor: in his footsteps.&quot; was published in 1988 by &quot;Australian Surveyor.&quot;

==Suicide==
Hellyer suicided on 9 September 1832, his incoherent suicide note ending with the following line:

&quot;Alas my mother, in agony I fly to my saviour.&quot;

His suicide was the inspiration for a 1998 play. Most theories about the suicide are speculation, except for a thorough investigation involving the well-validated technique of LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count). An analysis of his diaries from the day he left England, suggests he was suffering from ever-increasing depression. An alternative view has been advanced that he may have suffered from bipolar disorder. Baddeley, Daniel and Pennebaker&#x27;s analysis suggests that his final extreme distress could have been occasioned by gossip circulated about illegal sexual relationships with convict associates. There was no concrete evidence available at the time for this. It is more likely that this gossip was malicious and intended to blacken his name. There could well have been some envy at Stanley (the base for the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company) that Hellyer could look forward to a government appointment. As a devout Christian, he would have been devastated by this. A further suggestion is that he may have suffered from gelotophobia, an inability to deal with what he perceived as bullying, even if this was in fact merely thoughtless teasing.
A further LIWC analysis of the internal inquiry conducted into his suicide, on behalf of the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company, suggests there was a whitewash by those who might have been seen as involved in negative behaviour towards Hellyer.

Gwyneth Daniel&#x27;s detailed exposition of these and other points can be seen in &quot;Utmost Extrication. Why Henry Hellyer Shot Himself&quot;.

Despite the evidence concerning depression, in a letter to his sister-in-law in 1830 he wrote that he had been in excellent health ever since arriving in the Colony, &quot;...except for two or three short attacks occasioned by over-exertion and fatigue after some of my long excursions in the bush&quot;. There is no hint of what these &quot;attacks&quot; may have been, but there is no doubt that his explorations were marked by extraordinary energy and copious note-taking on everything that took his interest, from cicadas, through &quot;young centipedes white as snow&quot; to land-crab chimneys. He is often described as a visionary. The Chief agent of the VDL Co wrote of him, &quot;He is exceedingly chimerical in all his ideas... He would have mansions where I would have cottages&quot;, and elsewhere, &quot;...he may he said to look upon everything with a painter&#x27;s eye and upon his own discoveries in particular with an affection which is blind to all faults&quot;.

If Henry Hellyer was prone to &quot;attacks&quot; of depression after periods of over-exertion and fatigue, the winter of 1832 provided an occasion. He wrote: &quot;...The snow is so deep that we are completely hemmed in by it. It forms such hard lumps on my overalls... that I was completely fettered by it and in the greatest pain imaginable. One hour of this weather would kill any man if he were stuck fast and remained inactive. The poor dogs were literally plated with coats of mail formed by the ice on their hair, but they traveled better than we could, as the crust would support them...&quot;.

==Legacy==
Although Henry Hellyer had no descendants, his younger brother Thomas Hellyer (1801–41) migrated to New Zealand with his son William (1821–1885) by way of Hobart Town, Tasmania, where Thomas married his second wife on 11 June 1832. Henry Hellyer had by then advised the Court of Directors of the VDL Co that he would be leaving their service at the end of his contract, to accept an appointment with the Surveyor-General in Hobart Town, a highly coveted position that might have generated some envy among his colleagues. It is not known if the brothers had plans to work together, if they met, or if Henry Hellyer attended the wedding. He could have done so, since the VDL Co operated a cutter that made the trip regularly for mail and supplies, but his name is not listed amongst the witnesses.

Henry&#x27;s nephew William Hellyer migrated from New Zealand to New South Wales about 1838, and became a solicitor and was a member of the NSW Parliament for one day in 1861. Many Australian Hellyers are descended from William, whose son Thomas Henry Hellyer (1840–1889) was a member of the NSW Parliament from 1883 to 84.

<text>Donald Alexander Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, (6 August 182021 January 1914), known as Sir Donald A. Smith between May 1886 and August 1897, was a Scottish-born Canadian businessman who became one of the British Empire&#x27;s foremost builders and philanthropists. He became commissioner, governor and principal shareholder of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He was president of the Bank of Montreal and with his first cousin, George Stephen (later Lord Mount Stephen), co-founded the Canadian Pacific Railway. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and afterwards represented Montreal in the House of Commons of Canada. He was Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1896 to 1914. He was chairman of Burmah Oil and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He was chancellor of McGill University (1889–1914) and the University of Aberdeen.

King Edward VII called him &quot;Uncle Donald&quot;. His estate was valued at $5.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). During his lifetime, and including the bequests left after his death, he gave away just over $7.5 million-plus a further £1 million (not including private gifts and allowances) to a huge variety of charitable causes across Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. He personally raised Strathcona&#x27;s Horse, who saw their first action in the Second Boer War. He funded the building of Leanchoil Hospital. He and his first cousin, Lord Mount Stephen, purchased the land and then each gave $1 million to the City of Montreal to construct and maintain the Royal Victoria Hospital. He endowed the Lord Strathcona Medal and donated generously to McGill University, Aberdeen University, the Victoria University of Manchester, Yale University, the Prince of Wales Hospital Fund and the Imperial Institute. At McGill, he started the &quot;Donalda Program&quot; for the purpose of providing higher education for Canadian women, building the Royal Victoria College on Sherbrooke Street for that purpose in 1886. He also built the Strathcona Medical Building at McGill and endowed its chairs in pathology and hygiene.

==Early life==
Born 6 August 1820, on Forres High Street, in Moray, Scotland, he was the second son of Alexander Smith (1786–1841) and his wife Barbara Stuart, daughter of Donald Stuart (b.c.1740) of Leanchoil, Upper Strathspey, descended from Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany. His father, whose family had lived at Archiestown Cottage as crofters at Knockando, became a saddler at Forres after trying his hand at farming and soldiering. Donald was also a first cousin of the successful and notably philanthropic Grant brothers of Manchester, who were reputedly immortalised as the &quot;Cheeryble Brothers&quot; in Charles Dickens&#x27; book, Nicholas Nickleby. Donald&#x27;s mother was the sister of the Canadian explorer John Stuart, partner of the North West Company who rose to become Chief Factor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

Smith was educated at Anderson&#x27;s Free School and on leaving at age sixteen he was apprenticed to become a lawyer in the offices of Robert Watson, Town Clerk of Forres. By the age of eighteen, Smith chose another career path: offered entry into mercantile life at Manchester, and a career in the Indian Civil Service, his choice was to pattern himself on his uncle John Stuart (who had by then returned to live near Forres) who offered him a junior clerkship in the service of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Smith chose to follow his uncle&#x27;s career and sailed to Montreal that year.

==Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company==

Smith emigrated to Lower Canada in 1838 to work for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), becoming a clerk for the organization in 1842. He was given administrative control over the seigneury of Mingan (in modern Labrador) in late 1843, where his innovative methods met with the disapproval of HBC governor Sir George Simpson. The Mingan post burned down in 1846, and Smith left for Montreal the following year. He returned in 1848, and remained in Labrador until the 1860s, administering the fur trade and salmon fishing within the region.

In 1862, Smith was promoted as the company&#x27;s Chief Factor in charge of the Labrador district. He travelled to London in 1865, and made a favourable impression on the HBC&#x27;s directors. In 1868, he was promoted to Commissioner of the Montreal department, managing the HBC&#x27;s eastern operations. That same year, Smith joined with George Stephen, Richard Bladworth Angus, and Andrew Paton to establish the textile manufactory, Paton Manufacturing Company, in Sherbrooke.

In 1869, the government of John A. Macdonald held the HBC accountable for the disturbances reported in the Red River Colony, which was part of the proposed purchase of the original part of Rupert&#x27;s Land from the HBC. The person in charge of HBC&#x27;s nominal head office in Montreal was Smith, and he was asked by the Governor-General to investigate and write a Royal Commission report. Smith travelled to (present-day) Manitoba, and negotiated at Fort Garry with Louis Riel, who had been voted the leader of the resistance. Smith&#x27;s offers, including land recognition for the Métis, led to Riel calling a Council of 40 representatives, drawn half-and-half from the Metis and the HBC settlers, for formal negotiations. Smith returned to Ottawa in early 1870, and communicated the Royal Commission on the &quot;North-West Territories&quot;, which effectively made his name in Canada and London. Smith succeeded in gaining clemency for some prisoners within the region; he was not, however, able to prevent the execution of Thomas Scott by Riel&#x27;s provisional government. He was appointed that year to the office of President of the HBC&#x27;s Council of the Northern Department (effectively becoming administrator of the Northwest Territories, including Manitoba).

Smith accompanied Col. Garnet Wolseley&#x27;s military mission to Red River later in the year; following the end of the resistance, Wolseley appointed Smith as the Acting Governor of Assiniboia pending Lieutenant Governor Adams George Archibald&#x27;s arrival in the province. Smith stayed in the region after 1870 and was responsible for negotiating the transfer of HBC land to the federal government (as well as coordinating the transfer of several specific land claims in the region). Archibald appointed Smith to his Executive Council on 20 October 1870, although this decision was subsequently overturned by the Canadian government, which ruled that Archibald had overstepped his legal authority.

==Political career==

In Manitoba&#x27;s first general election, held on 27 December 1870, Smith was elected to the provincial legislature for the riding of Winnipeg and St. John, defeating long-time HBC nemesis John Christian Schultz by 71 votes to 63. Smith was a supporter of Archibald&#x27;s consensus government, and opposed Schultz&#x27;s ultra-loyalist Canadian Party; there was a riot among the Ontario soldiers stationed in Winnipeg following the announcement of Smith&#x27;s victory.

Politicians were allowed to serve in both the provincial and federal parliaments in this period of Manitoba history, and Smith was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the newly formed riding of Selkirk in early 1871. He sat as an Independent Conservative, and initially supported the government of Sir John A. Macdonald. Easily re-elected in 1872, Smith was a strong defender of HBC interests in the House of Commons, and also spoke for issues concerning Manitoba and the Northwest. He helped create the Bank of Manitoba and the Manitoba Insurance Company during this period, assisted by banker Sir Hugh Allan.

In 1872 Smith was appointed to the first group of members of the Temporary North-West Council the first governing assembly of the North-West Territories. Smith was one of the few people who served on two provincial/territorial legislatures and the federal parliament at the same time.

Smith broke with Macdonald in 1873, after the Prime Minister had delayed reimbursement for Smith&#x27;s earlier expenses in Red River. Smith voted to censure the government in a motion over the Pacific Scandal and was thereby partly responsible for the government&#x27;s defeat. Smith remained an Independent Conservative, but his relations with the official Conservative representatives were often strained in later years.

Manitoba abolished the &quot;dual mandate&quot; in 1873, and Smith resigned from the provincial legislature in early 1874 (the first person to do so). In the Canadian general election of 1874, Smith defeated Liberal candidate Andrew G. B. Bannatyne by 329 votes to 225. The &quot;Manitoba Free Press&quot;, at the time, suggested that Smith had encouraged Bannatyne&#x27;s candidacy to prevent more serious opposition from emerging.

In 1873, the HBC separated its fur trade and land sales operations, putting Smith in charge of the latter. Smith had developed an interest in railway expansion through his work with the HBC, and in 1875 was among the incorporators of the Manitoba Western Railway. He was also a partner in the Red River Transportation Company, which gained control over the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in March 1878. His business ventures increasingly dominated his labours, and he formally resigned as land commissioner in early 1879, though he remained a leading figure in the HBC&#x27;s operations for another 30 years.

Smith faced a serious electoral challenge from former Manitoba Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris in the general election of 1878. Aided on this occasion by the &quot;Manitoba Free Press&quot;, Smith defeated Morris by 555 votes to 546; local Conservative organizers protested the result, and it was overturned two years later. On 10 September 1880, Smith was defeated by former Winnipeg Mayor Thomas Scott, 735 votes to 577.

==Corporate leader==

In May 1879, Smith became a director in the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway Company, having control over 20% of its shares. He was subsequently a leading figure in the creation of the Canadian Pacific Railway, although he was not appointed as a director of the organization until 1883 because of his lingering animosity with Sir John A. Macdonald (who had again become prime minister in 1878). During his tenure on the board, Smith had the honour of driving the last spike at Craigellachie, British Columbia to complete the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway rail line. Smith remained on the board of directors for several years, although he was by-passed for the company&#x27;s presidency in 1888, in favour of William Cornelius Van Horne.

Smith became extremely wealthy through his investments, and he was involved in a myriad of Canadian and American corporations in the latter part of the 19th century. He was appointed to the board of the Bank of Montreal in 1872, became its vice-president in 1882, and was promoted to the Presidency in 1887. His leadership in real estate transactions caused Smith to become a financier, and he was thus involved in (or founded) over 80 trust structures, including the Royal Trust and Montreal Trust. He retained a significant interest in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company throughout his life and became in 1889 Governor of the company that had made his name.

Smith was also involved in the newspaper industry in his later years. His attempt to take over the &quot;Toronto Globe&quot; in 1882 was unsuccessful, though he took effective control of the &quot;Manitoba Free Press&quot; from William Fisher Luxton in 1893. In 1889, he was the principal shareholder of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and was elected as its 26th governor, holding this position until his death in 1914.

==Later political career==
Smith was re-elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 1887, in the Quebec riding of Montreal West, and once again sat as an &quot;Independent Conservative&quot;. In the same year he received an honorary Doctor of Laws from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was re-elected in the election of 1891, defeating his only opponent, James Cochrane, 4586 votes to 880. Smith remained interested in Manitoba politics, and attempted (without success) to broker a compromise between Thomas Greenway and the federal government during the Manitoba school crisis of the 1890s.

==High Commissioner==
Prime Minister Sir Mackenzie Bowell wanted Smith to succeed him in 1896, but Smith refused. The position of Prime Minister instead went to Sir Charles Tupper, who appointed Smith as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom on 24 April 1896.

Sir Wilfrid Laurier retained Smith as High Commissioner following the Liberal election victory of 1896, although his powers were somewhat undercut. He was created Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, of Glencoe in the County of Argyll and of Mount Royal in the Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, on 23 August 1897, as part of the 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours. He had already been made KCMG on 29 May 1886, promoted to GCMG on 20 May 1896, and was further made GCVO in 1908. He cooperated with Manitoba Liberal Clifford Sifton in opening the Canadian prairies to eastern-European immigration. He raised Strathcona&#x27;s Horse, a private unit of Canadian soldiers, during the Second Boer War, and became one of the leading supporters of British imperialism within London. After the end of the war, he was appointed among the members of a Royal Commission set up to investigate the conduct of the Second Boer War (the Elgin Commission 1902–1903). He was involved in the creation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, of which he became the chairman in 1909. Lord Strathcona subsequently used his influence to make the company a major supplier of the Royal Navy.

He was granted a second creation of the Barony, with a Special Remainder in favour of his daughter Margaret Charlotte Howard, as Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, of Mount Royal in the Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada, and of Glencoe in the County of Argyll, on 26 June 1900.

He was Lord Rector of the University of Aberdeen (1899–1902), and he received the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen in a ceremony on 9 April 1902.

On 12 February 1902, he was appointed an Honorary Colonel of the 8th (Volunteer) Battalion, the King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment), and the same month he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the Victoria University of Manchester, in connection with the 50th jubilee of the establishment of the university. He received the honorary degree Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) from the University of Oxford in October 1902, in connection with the tercentenary of the Bodleian Library.

He was sworn in as a Member of the Imperial Privy Council in 1904. He received the Freedom of the City of Bath on 13 July 1911.

==Philanthropy==

Strathcona was a leading philanthropist in his later years, donating large sums of money to various organizations in Britain, Canada and elsewhere. His largest donations were made with George Stephen, donating the money to build the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal that opened its doors in 1893. Strathcona also made a major donation to McGill University in Montreal, where he helped establish a school for women in 1884 (Royal Victoria College). He was named Chancellor of McGill in 1888, and he held the post until his death. He also bequeathed funds to the Sheffield Scientific School for a science and engineering building and to support two professorships in engineering. He was awarded an honorary degree from Yale University in 1892. He contributed donations to the new University of Birmingham following representations by Joseph Chamberlain.

In 1910, Strathcona deposited in trust with the Dominion Government the sum of $500,000, bearing an annual interest of 4%, to develop citizenship and patriotism, for example in the Royal Canadian Army Cadets movement, through physical training, rifle shooting, and military drill. A &quot;Syllabus of Physical Exercises for Schools&quot; was published by the Trust in 1911. He is remembered today by the Cadets with the Lord Strathcona Medal.

==Death==

Lord Strathcona died in 1914 in London and was buried at Highgate Cemetery. His imposing red granite vault is the first vault after entering the Eastern Cemetery. His seventy-five-year tenure with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company remains a record.

He lived in Montreal&#x27;s Golden Square Mile. In 1895, he purchased an estate in Scotland, building and living at Glencoe House. In 1905, he purchased the Island of Colonsay including Colonsay House (where his descendants still live) and the Island of Oronsay, both on the Hebridean coast of Scotland. He kept a house in London and after his appointment as Canadian High Commissioner leased Knebworth House from 1899 until his death. He was given a full state funeral at Westminster Abbey, where a memorial stands to his memory, and would have been entombed there but he preferred to rest next to his wife, who pre-deceased him by several months, in Highgate Cemetery.

His obituary in &quot;The Times of London&quot; read in part,
==Family==

In 1853, he married Isabella Sophia Hardisty (1825–1913), daughter of Richard Hardisty (1790–1865), Chief Trader of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and Margaret Sutherland (1802–1876), daughter of the Rev. John Sutherland, a native of Caithness who lived at Lachine, Quebec. Lady Strathcona&#x27;s father was a native of London, England, and her mother was of Indian and Scottish parentage. Her brother was the Hon. Richard Charles Hardisty. She was presented to King Edward and Queen Alexandra, 13 March 1903, and with her daughter donated $100,000 to McGill University in Montreal to erect a new wing to its Medical Building. The couple lived at 53 Cadogan Square, London; Knebworth House; Debden Hall; Glencoe House, Scotland; Colonsay House, Scotland and 1157 Dorchester Street, in Montreal&#x27;s Golden Square Mile.

Lord and Lady Strathcona were the parents of one child, the Hon. Margaret Charlotte Smith. In accordance with the special remainder to the 1900 barony, she succeeded her father as Lady Strathcona in 1914. In 1888, she married Robert Jared Bliss Howard OBE FRCS (1859–1921), son of Robert Palmer Howard (1823–1889), Dean of Medicine at McGill University.

Robert Howard and Lady Strathcona had the following children:

* The Hon. Frances Margaret Palmer Howard (born 13 February 1889, died 5 October 1958)
* The Rt Hon. Donald Sterling Palmer Howard, 3rd Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal (born 14 June 1891, died 22 February 1959)
* The Hon. Robert Henry Palmer Howard (born 1893, killed in action 8 May 1915)
* The Hon. Edith Mary Palmer Howard (born 7 April 1895, died 1979), married John Brooke Molesworth Parnell, 6th Baron Congleton on 6 April 1918
* The Hon. Sir Arthur Jared Palmer Howard, KBE CVO (born 30 May 1896, died 26 April 1971)

His Montreal home was located in the Golden Square Mile. In 1905, he bought the island of Colonsay in the Inner Hebrides, which remains in the hands of his successors today.

==Legacy==
Lord Strathcona is commemorated in Montreal by several McGill University buildings; he gave freely of his time to this institution, and a great quantity of his wealth. In Westmount, a street was named in his honour. In the greater Montreal West Island community, the Strathcona Desjardins Credit Union bears his name, with offices downtown Montreal and in Kirkland. The credit union members were historically from the English-speaking hospitals of Montreal, but since recent mergers also include the Montreal area, English-speaking teachers.

The Strathcona family mansion in Montreal on Dorchester Street (now René Lévesque Boulevard) near Fort Street was torn down in 1941 to make way for an apartment building.

Strathcona Avenue, located in Westmount (a suburb on the island of Montreal) is named in his honour.

Strathcona is commemorated in Manitoba by the Rural Municipality of Strathcona and by three streets in Winnipeg: Donald Street and Smith Street in the downtown core, and Strathcona Street in the city&#x27;s West End. In Alberta he is commemorated by the Calgary neighbourhood of Strathcona Park by the Edmonton neighbourhood of Strathcona, and by the municipality of Strathcona County. In British Columbia, the Vancouver neighbourhood of Strathcona takes its name from Lord Strathcona School built in 1891, and Mount Sir Donald in Glacier National Park is named after him. There are oil portraits of Lord Strathcona by many artists, but the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury seems to have made a number of head and shoulder portraits of him from 1898 (examples may be found at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad offices and in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company [this has a repainted background]), and the artist also presented his 1899 bust-length charcoal and crayon drawing of Strathcona to McGill University in Montreal in 1916.

The Town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories is named after Donald Smith. There is a stained glass window memorializing him in Westminster Abbey. His coat of arms appears over the main entrance of Marischal College in Aberdeen. Strathcona Park, which was erected by the city of Ottawa in 1907, is dedicated to him. The Town of Transcona, Manitoba, incorporated in 1912 as a community to support the new railway shops of the Grand Trunk Pacific and National Transcontinental railways, takes half its name from Lord Strathcona, and the other half from the word &quot;transcontinental&quot;.

Strathcona was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1973.

===Ships named for Lord Strathcona===

At least three ships were named for Lord Strathcona during his lifetime. These were:

* &quot;Strathcona&quot;, a 598-ton, 142-foot wooden sidewheel paddle steamer, was built in 1898 by J. Macfarlane at New Westminster, British Columbia for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The vessel was operated on the Pacific Northwest coast and in 1898-99 carried elements of the Yukon Field Force. In 1902 &quot;Strathcona&quot; was sold to S.J.V. Spratt, later passing into the hands of the Sidney &amp; Nanaimo Transportation Company. On 17 November 1909, the vessel was wrecked on a snag near Pages Landing on the Fraser River. In 1910 &quot;Strathcona&quot; was refloated and towed to New Westminster, where the engines and boilers were removed and the hull abandoned.
* &quot;Strathcona&quot;, a 1,881-ton, 253-foot steel canal-sized Great Lakes freighter, was built in 1900 by the Caledon Shipbuilding Company in Dundee, Scotland. This steamer was converted from a bulk carrier to a package freighter in 1911 by the Collingwood Shipbuilding Company at Collingwood, Ontario. &quot;Strathcona&quot; sailed for Inland Lines, Ltd., of Hamilton, Ontario until 1913, whereupon it passed into the hands of Canada Steamship Lines when that fleet was established. In 1915 &quot;Strathcona&quot; was requisitioned for ocean service during the First World War. While bound from the Tyne to Marseilles, France, &quot;Strathcona&quot; was sunk by a scuttling charge from SM &quot;U-78&quot; on 13 April 1917 when some 145 miles west-northwest of North Ronaldsay, Orkney Islands.
* &quot;Lord Strathcona&quot;, a 495-ton, 160-foot steel salvage tug, was built in 1902 by J.P. Renoldson &amp; Sons, Ltd., at South Shields, England. Owned by George T. Davie &amp; Sons of Lauzon, Quebec, this tug arrived on its delivery voyage on 4 May 1902. &quot;Lord Strathcona&quot; was sold in 1912 to the Quebec Salvage &amp; Wrecking Company, Ltd., a Canadian Pacific subsidiary, and remained in service through the end of the Second World War. Ownership passed to Foundation Maritime in 1944, and &quot;Lord Strathcona&quot; was scrapped in 1947.

A fourth ship, &quot;Lord Strathcona&quot;, was a 7,335-ton, 455-foot ocean steamer built in 1915 by W. Doxford &amp; Sons Ltd. at Sunderland, England. Owned by the Dominion Line, &quot;Lord Strathcona&quot; was bound from Wabana, Newfoundland to Sydney, Nova Scotia with iron ore when the vessel was torpedoed and sunk by U-513 on 5 September 1942. &quot;Lord Strathcona&quot;&#x27;s crew of 44, including Captain Charles Stewart, were rescued.

<doc id="1031515" wikidata="Q170606" url="?curid=1031515" title="Eva Mendes">
<text>Eva de la Caridad Méndez (, ; born March 5, 1974), known professionally as Eva Mendes, is a retired American actress. Her acting career began in the late 1990s with a series of roles in films such as &quot;Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror&quot; (1998) and &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; (2000).

Mendes&#x27;s performance in &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001) marked a turning point in her career and led to parts in the commercially successful films &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; (2003) and &quot;Hitch&quot; (2005). She starred in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Spirit&quot; (2008), both film adaptations of comics, and ventured into more dramatic territory with &quot;We Own the Night&quot; (2007), &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot; (2009), &quot;Last Night&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot; (2012). Her other films include &quot;Out of Time&quot; (2003), &quot;The Women&quot; (2008), &quot;The Other Guys&quot; (2010), and &quot;Girl in Progress&quot; (2012).

Mendes has appeared in several music videos for artists such as Will Smith and has also been an ambassador for brands including Calvin Klein, Cartier, Reebok, Pantene shampoo, Morgan and Peek &amp; Cloppenburg. She has designed for New York &amp; Company and is the creative director of CIRCA Beauty, a makeup line sold at Walgreens.

==Early life==
Mendes was born on March 5, 1974, in Miami, to Cuban parents Eva Pérez Suárez and Juan Carlos Méndez and was raised by her mother in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silver Lake after her parents&#x27; divorce. Her mother worked at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre and later for an aerospace company, and her father ran a meat distribution business. Mendes had an older brother Juan Carlos Méndez Jr. (1963–2016), who died from throat cancer, and a younger brother, Carlo (born 1978). She attended Hoover High School in Glendale and later studied marketing at California State University, Northridge, but left college to pursue acting under Ivana Chubbuck.

==Acting career==
===Beginnings and breakthrough (1998–2001)===
Mendes started her acting career after a talent manager saw her photograph in a friend&#x27;s portfolio. Her first film role was as part of a group of young people who become lost in middle America in the direct-to-video horror film &quot;Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror&quot;. Mendes was disappointed in her performance and soon hired an acting coach. She subsequently took on the roles of a bridesmaid in the comedy &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998) with Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, a housekeeper in the fantasy family film &quot;My Brother the Pig&quot; (1999) with Scarlett Johansson, and an ill-fated film student in the slasher film &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; (2000).

Mendes appeared in the Steven Seagal action thriller &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; (2001), which made over US$73 million worldwide. According to Mendes, her voice was dubbed in the editing after a producer told her she &quot;didn&#x27;t sound intelligent enough&quot;. Her breakthrough came later in 2001 with her performance as the mistress of a corrupt cop in Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Training Day&quot; alongside Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. She described her role as pivotal in her career, motivating her to keep going as an actress after she had become bored doing &quot;terrible, cheesy horrible films.&quot; &quot;Training Day&quot; was a box office hit, grossing US$104.5 million.

===Worldwide exposure (2002–2009)===

Her role in &quot;Training Day&quot; led to larger film parts and Mendes soon established herself as a Hollywood actress. While her sole film release in 2002 was the crime comedy &quot;All About the Benjamins&quot;, in which she played the girlfriend of a con artist, Mendes had roles in four studio feature films released throughout 2003. &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; teamed her with Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson while portraying a United States Customs Service agent working undercover for a notorious Argentine drug lord. The film gave Mendes much wider exposure, grossing over US$236 million globally. The Western action film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; saw her star as the daughter of a Mexican drug lord, alongside Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. While reviews for the film were mixed, it made US$98.1 million.

Mendes reunited with Denzel Washington for the thriller &quot;Out of Time&quot;, in which she played the soon-to-be ex-wife of a well-respected chief of police. The film was a moderate commercial success, and Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, described Mendes&#x27; role as a &quot;curiously forgiving character, who feels little rancor for the straying [husband] and apparently still likes him; maybe there would have been more suspense if she were furious with him&quot;. Her last 2003 film was the comedy &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, with Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear, in which she played an aspiring actress.

She starred as the love interest of a professional dating consultant (Will Smith), in her next film, &quot;Hitch&quot; (2005), &quot;USA Today&quot; described it as &quot;her best screen role to date&quot;, and &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; remarked: &quot;Smith and Mendes are terrific together. He brings her game up so high you&#x27;d think she has had as many good parts as Smith.&quot; &quot;Hitch&quot; made US$368.1 million in its global theatrical run. In 2005, Mendes also starred in the little-seen films &quot;The Wendell Baker Story&quot; and &quot;Guilty Hearts&quot;.

In the romantic comedy &quot;Trust the Man&quot; (2006), Mendes starred with David Duchovny, Billy Crudup, Julianne Moore, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, playing what &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described as a &quot;vapid sexpot&quot;. The much criticized &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (2007), based on the Marvel Comics character, featured Mendes as the love interest of the titular character (Nicolas Cage). The film fared well commercially, opening atop at the North American box office, with earnings of more than US$45 million; it eventually made over US$228 million worldwide. She starred opposite Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg in the thriller &quot;We Own the Night&quot; (also 2007), as the girlfriend of an NYPD captain&#x27;s brother. Critic Peter Travers found the film to be &quot;defiantly, refreshingly unhip&quot; and noted that &quot;sizzle comes naturally&quot; from Mendes. In 2007, she also starred in the films &quot;Live!&quot; and &quot;Cleaner&quot;, both of which went unnoticed by audiences, and made an uncredited cameo appearance in the comedy &quot;Knocked Up&quot;.

In 2008, Mendes took on the role of a perfume salesgirl in Saks Fifth Avenue in the all-female comedy &quot;The Women&quot;, opposite Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Debra Messing, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Though a commercial success, &quot;The Women&quot; was panned by critics, with Mendes earning a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performance. She also played the &quot;femme fatale&quot; Sand Saref in 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit&quot;, based on the newspaper comic strip of the same name by Will Eisner. It received lackluster reviews from critics, who deemed it melodramatic, unoriginal, and sexist. Her only 2009 film release was the crime drama &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot;, which reunited her with Nicolas Cage, playing a prostitute, and again, his love interest. While the film found a limited audience in theaters, it garnered acclaim, appearing on many top ten lists of the year.

===Further roles and retirement (2010–2014)===

Mendes reunited with previous collaborators Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg for the action comedy &quot;The Other Guys&quot; (2010), in which she portrayed the wife of a mild-mannered forensic NYPD accountant (Ferrell). It was a commercial success, grossing US$170.4 million globally. In 2010, she also played the co-worker and the love interest of a committed man in Massy Tadjedin&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Last Night&quot;, alongside Keira Knightley and Sam Worthington. While she was initially reluctant to star, worrying that the character would &quot;lack originality&quot; and was &quot;too seductive&quot;, she agreed to play the role after meeting with Tadjedin; she said: &quot;It was great to connect with a female director and talk about this woman and not objectify her as the other woman but give her a real true life and make her honest ... Thank God I did.&quot;

In 2011, Mendes appeared in an uncredited cameo in &quot;Fast Five&quot;, reprising her role from &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;. In 2012, she starred in the dramedy &quot;Girl in Progress&quot;, as a single mom raising her fourteen-year-old daughter, and in the art fantasy drama &quot;Holy Motors&quot;, as Kay M, a role originally written for Kate Moss. While &quot;Girl in Progress&quot; earned Mendes an ALMA Award nomination for Favorite Movie Actress, she described &quot;Holy Motors&quot; as &quot;the coolest, most creative thing I&#x27;ve ever done&quot;.

In &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot; (also 2012), a drama directed by Derek Cianfrance and alongside Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, Mendes portrayed the former lover of a motorcycle stuntman. The film was a moderate commercial success, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, in its review, described her performance as &quot;quietly heartbreaking&quot;. She also visited Sierra Leone and was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;, which aired in October 2012.

In 2013, Mendes appeared in the HBO comedy film &quot;Clear History&quot; as a formerly heavy-set woman, and in 2014, she starred as a cabaret show performer in Ryan Gosling&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Lost River&quot;, which competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival. Thereafter, she retired from the film industry. Speaking of her retirement in 2022, Mendes said:

==Other endeavors==
===Modeling===
Mendes appeared in the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; music video for &quot;Se a vida é (That&#x27;s the Way Life Is)&quot; in 1996, Aerosmith&#x27;s music video for &quot;Hole in My Soul&quot; in 1997, and Will Smith&#x27;s music video for &quot;Miami&quot; in 1998. She also appeared in the music video for The Strokes&#x27; &quot;The End Has No End&quot; in 2004.

In 2005, Mendes was employed by Revlon as an international spokesperson, and participated in their campaign to raise funds for breast cancer research. In December 2007, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) used a nude photo of Mendes for their anti-fur campaign. Mendes was a spokesmodel for the 2008 Campari calendar. She also appeared nude in a 2008 print advertisement for Calvin Klein&#x27;s Secret Obsession perfume, an ad that United States network executives found too risqué for broadcasting.

Mendes has been a spokesperson for Calvin Klein, Magnum, and the chocolate milk brand Cocio. She also promoted Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel fragrance, Reebok shoes, and Pantene shampoo. In 2011, Mendes appeared in a Peek &amp; Cloppenburg clothing catalog.

===Fashion designing===
Mendes has a line of bed linens and dinnerware that is sold at Macy&#x27;s. In February 2013, she partnered with New York &amp; Co. to launch her own fashion line, Eva by Eva Mendes. She is also the creative director of the makeup brand CIRCA Beauty, which launched exclusively at Walgreens in 2015.

===Singing===
In 2010, Mendes sang &quot;Pimps Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, a song featured in &quot;The Other Guys,&quot; and also performed a duet with CeeLo Green with the same song. In 2011, she recorded a version of &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot;. She also featured in the single &quot;Miami&quot; sung by Will Smith which was released in 1998.

==Public image==

Many media outlets have cited her as one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful Latin women, and she has been often considered a sex symbol. She once embraced that status, saying it was &quot;partially self-created ... I think at times I play up my sexiness. And there&#x27;s times where I don&#x27;t&quot;, though she does not let it interfere with her film work: &quot;I like it when it doesn&#x27;t limit my career. It&#x27;s a part of my life, but on a secondary plane&quot;. Nevertheless, her professional trajectory throughout the 2000s tended to gravitate towards parts that relied heavily on her looks. She has not appeared in a film since 2014.

Mendes ranked 54th, 12th, 7th, 7th, and 11th in &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 issue in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2010 respectively, and appeared several times on the cover. She also ranked 80th, 23rd and 44th in &quot;FHM&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; supplement in 2004, 2005, 2006. She was voted number four in the 2008 edition, and number one in the 2009 edition, of AskMen.com&#x27;s Top 99 Most Desirable Women. &quot;People&quot; also named her one of 2011&#x27;s Most Beautiful at Every Age.

==Personal life==
Mendes began dating music producer George Augusto in 2002. They broke up in 2011.

In 2008, she entered the Cirque Lodge Rehabilitation Centre in Utah to address a dependency problem related to drugs and alcohol.

In September 2011, she began dating Ryan Gosling, shortly after they filmed &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot; together. They have two daughters, born in 2014 and 2016. When asked in a 2022 interview if she and Gosling had married, Mendes said that &quot;I like to keep it all mysterious&quot;.

Mendes is a pescetarian for ethical and health reasons. She also practices Transcendental Meditation.

<text>Greg Vanney (born June 11, 1974) is an American former professional soccer player and head coach of the LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer.

A defender and one of MLS&#x27;s original players, Vanney spent 10 seasons in the league and another three-and-a-half in the French First Division playing for Sporting Club de Bastia between 2002 and 2005. He also earned 36 caps, scoring one goal, with the U.S. national team between 1996 and 2006.

In 2017, as coach of Toronto FC, Vanney won the domestic treble by winning the MLS Cup, Supporters&#x27; Shield and the Canadian Championship.

==Playing career==

===High school and college===
Vanney played soccer for Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe, Arizona, and led the team to three consecutive state championship titles in 1990, 1991, and 1992. Vanney holds the school record for most assists by one player in a season with 13 for the 1990–1991 season, and also holds the school record for most goals by one player in a single season with 33 goals for the 1991–1992 season. He was also named the 5A player of the year for the 1991–1992 season, Gatorade Player of the Year, NSCAA and Parade All-America in 1992. Greg Vanney played college soccer for Florida International University in 1992, and for UCLA from 1993 to 1995. In 1995, Vanney was named All-America honorable mention and finished his senior season with 8 goals and 10 assists.

===Professional===
Vanney was drafted 17th overall in the 1996 MLS College Draft by the Los Angeles Galaxy. The team sent him on loan to the Sacramento Scorpions of USISL for three games at the beginning of the season where he netted three goals in three games including two game winners. Vanney played for the Galaxy for six years, from 1996 to 2001, and was consistently one of the best defenders in MLS, leading the Galaxy to three MLS Cup Finals and two CONCACAF Champion&#x27;s Cup Finals. He was named to the MLS Best XI in both 2000 and 2001, and an MLS All-Star in 2001. After the 2001 MLS season, Vanney transferred to the French First Division club SC Bastia. In the first six months with Bastia, Vanney helped lead the French club to its first appearance in the Coupe de France Final in over 20 years. He left the club in 2005, coming back to MLS and signing with FC Dallas. After two seasons with the Hoops, and two All-Star selections, Vanney was traded to Colorado on January 12, 2007. On June 29, 2007, he was traded from the Rapids to D.C. United. On February 15, 2008, the rights for Vanney were transferred to his first club, the Los Angeles Galaxy. Vanney announced his retirement from the professional game on October 26, 2008; his last game against his former club FC Dallas.

===International===
Vanney also spent 11 years as a member of the United States national team, debuting December 21, 1996 against Guatemala, and played 36 games and scored one goal (September 2005). Vanney participated in three FIFA World Cup qualifying cycles for the United States (1998, 2002 and 2006). He was originally named as an alternate for the 2002 FIFA World Cup but initially replaced the injured Chris Armas on the roster after the midfielder picked up an ACL injury in a warm-up friendly against Uruguay on May 12, 2002. Vanney was himself injured in the next warm-up friendly on May 16, 2002, against Jamaica and was replaced on the roster by Steve Cherundolo. Vanney also was a member of the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Championship team and was featured in the early part of 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying for the United States.

==Coaching career==

===Early career===
Vanney has more than 15 years experience in youth soccer: coaching, directing and consulting. He holds a USSF &quot;A&quot; Coaching License and has been actively involved with the U.S. Soccer Development Academy as a scout and other programming.

Vanney co-founded Arizona Futbol Club, a youth soccer club, in 1997 using a business plan Vanney started as a class assignment while attending UCLA. The club was later merged into Sereno Soccer Club.

Vanney was a member of the U.S. Soccer Education Staff that traveled to Spain in March 2010.

Vanney was an Academy Director for Real Salt Lake from 2008 to 2011. Vanney and his staff, with the support of Grande Sports World and Real Salt Lake, established the first MLS Residential Academy in the United States in fewer than 8 months. The U-18 and U-16 boys teams began play in Fall 2010.

Greg Vanney moved back to Arizona in 2008. For some time, he held two titles: (1.) Director of Soccer Operations at Grande Sports World in Casa Grande, Arizona and (2.) Director of the Real Salt Lake-Arizona Youth Academy. As Director of Soccer Operations, Vanney oversaw program and event development at the Grande Sports World facility featuring 8 professional quality fields; state-of-the-art performance center with 4 stadium quality locker rooms; weight room, physical therapy and 16 classrooms. In the first year, Vanney has help attract four professional teams (Real Salt Lake, Seattle Sounders FC, Colorado Rapids, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC) to the facility to host their preseason camps.

In January 2011, Vanney joined Chivas USA as an assistant coach.

===Toronto FC===
Vanney got his first head coaching job in Major League Soccer when he became the ninth head coach for Toronto FC after Ryan Nelsen was dismissed on August 31, 2014, with 10 games remaining in the 2014 regular season. He inherited a 9–9–6 record. In his debut match, Toronto lost 1–0 to the Philadelphia Union. His first win came in a match that finished 3–0 against Chivas USA. He finished off the 2014 season in seventh place in the Eastern Conference with a record of two wins, six losses and two ties.

Toronto were eliminated from the Canadian Championship during the 2015 season, although they qualified for the playoffs for the first time that season, after finishing sixth in the Eastern Conference. The club&#x27;s rivals Montreal Impact eliminated Toronto in the knockout round.

During the 2016 season, Toronto won the Canadian Championship and qualified for the playoffs after finishing in third place in the Eastern Conference. They got to the MLS Cup final where they lost in shoot-out 5–4 to Seattle Sounders FC following a goalless draw after extra-time.

The arrival of Spanish playmaker Victor Vázquez in midfield at the beginning of the 2017 season saw less responsibility placed on the club&#x27;s star forward Sebastian Giovinco and captain Michael Bradley to create Toronto&#x27;s goalscoring opportunities, and this in turn freed up the Italian, enabling him to focus more on his attacking game; furthermore, Greg Vanney&#x27;s switch in tactics from a 4–4–2 diamond to a 3–5–2 formation benefitted Giovinco&#x27;s and Jozy Altidore&#x27;s attacking partnership: by playing closer together, and with Vázquez now supporting them as the team&#x27;s main creator, the attacking duo began to demonstrate a deeper understanding and an increased awareness of each other&#x27;s movements, which improved their link-up play, and saw an increase in Altidore&#x27;s goalscoring output throughout the season. On June 27, Toronto defeated Montreal 2–1 at home in the second leg of the 2017 Canadian Championship final to capture the title for the second consecutive season, edging Montreal 3–2 on aggregate. On September 30, 2017, Toronto FC captured the Supporters&#x27; Shield with a 4–2 home win over New York Red Bulls, to clinch top of the league with the most points that season. On November 27, 2017, Vanney won the MLS Coach of the Year award. On December 9, 2017, Vanney led Toronto FC to MLS Cup victory in a 2–0 victory against Seattle. Greg Vanney was also named CONCACAF Coach of the Year.

Following an early round play-off elimination, Vanney resigned as coach of Toronto FC on December 1, 2020.

===LA Galaxy===
In January 2021, Vanney was named as head coach of the LA Galaxy, his former club, where he played for seven seasons.

After narrowly missing the playoffs in 2021, Vanney&#x27;s Galaxy finished fourth in the Western Conference (ninth overall) in the 2022 season, the highest positions for the club since 2016. LA beat Nashville 1–0 in the first round, but fell to rivals Los Angeles FC 3–2 in the conference semifinals.

In 2024, Vanney led the Galaxy to its highest points total since 1998 (64, on par with the 2014 MLS Cup-winning side). The Galaxy would win MLS Cup against the New York Red Bulls, 2-1, thus giving Vanney his second MLS Cup as a coach and the Galaxy&#x27;s first in exactly 10 years.

==Personal life==

Vanney is the uncle of LA Galaxy defender Eriq Zavaleta.

==Broadcasting==
In 2009, Greg Vanney provided color commentary with play-by-play announcer Kevin Calabro for Seattle Sounders FC games on FSN Northwest and KONG-TV and radio.

<doc id="1031521" wikidata="Q1185514" url="?curid=1031521" title="Irori">
<text>An irori (, ) is a traditional Japanese sunken hearth fired with charcoal. Used for heating the home and for cooking food, it is essentially a square, stone-lined pit in the floor, equipped with an adjustable pothook – called a &quot;jizaikagi&quot; () and generally consisting of an iron rod within a bamboo tube – used for raising or lowering a suspended pot or kettle by means of an attached lever which is often decoratively designed in the shape of a fish. Historically &quot;irori&quot; served as the main source of residential heating and lighting, providing a place to cook, dry clothing, and serve as a communal gathering location.

== Function ==
The irori () has the following functions.

; Residential heating
: The irori was generally located in the center of the room and used for heating the whole room.
; Cooking
: The irori was used for cooking. A () was used for hanging a pot over the fire. Fish and other food items were often skewered and stuck into ashes around the fire. They could also be buried in the ashes to be grilled. Sometimes a sake-filled &quot;tokkuri&quot; was heated by burying it in the ashes. In the &quot;Hokuriku&quot; region, cooking was done with irori until the &quot;kamado&quot; (cooking stoves) became widespread in the 1950s. In warm western Japan, people have disliked using irori during the summer and have used &quot;kamado&quot; and irori separately depending on the seasons from a long time ago.
; Lighting
: The irori was used for lighting at night. In the pre-modern period, when fire was the primary illumination source, irori could safely light up rooms. In ancient times, only oil and candles were used for lighting.
; Drying
: The irori was used for drying clothes, food, raw wood, etc. by using &quot;hidana&quot; (wood lattice) hung from the ceiling over the irori or clothing racks placed by the irori.
; Source for making fire
: The fire in the irori was kept burning, and used for the source for making a fire of &quot;kamado&quot; or lighting equipments especially during the time without matches.
; A place for family communication
: The irori functioned as a place where a family gathers. During meals and the night, people naturally gathered around irori and had conversations. Generally, each members of the family had a fixed place to sit, and irori functioned as a place to reaffirm the hierarchical order within the family. The names of each seats around the irori vary, but some examples include &quot;yokoza&quot;, &quot;kakaza&quot;, &quot;kyakaza&quot;, &quot;kijiri&quot;, or &quot;geza&quot;. The seat farthest from the doma (the entryway) named yokoza was the seat of family head, the children sat in the seat closest to the doma named kajiri. The guests and the head&#x27;s wife sat on both sides of these seats.
; Improvement of the durability of the house
: The irori fills the room with warm air, which lowers the moisture content in the wood and makes it less susceptible to decay. In addition, the tar (wood tar) contained in the smoke from burning wood permeates the beams and thatched roof making them insect resistant and waterproof. However, the smoke in the house can also cause eye disease and other health problems.

== Hazards ==
Similar to kerosene heaters common in rural Japan, burning charcoal produces fine particulates and carbon monoxide, the latter which can pose immediate health hazards in a poorly ventilated space. Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter has been implicated in elevated rates of glaucoma and cataracts. High rates have been observed among smokers and rural Indian farmers who practice stubble burning.

<doc id="1031525" wikidata="Q837626" url="?curid=1031525" title="Sunny Bay station">
<text>Sunny Bay () is an MTR station in Yam O. It is between Tung Chung and Tsing Yi stations. The station is an interchange station between the and the to Hong Kong Disneyland. The station was originally to be named &quot;Yam O&quot; (); however, the name was ultimately replaced, likely because of its linguistically negative connotations.Services to the station commenced on 1 June 2005. The transfer facilities to the opened on 1 August that year. The livery of the station is slate grey.

The station was the first MTR station to have automatic platform gates (APG) installed on the edge of its platforms. These gates range from to the height of the platform screen doors found in other MTR stations. In line with ground level and above-ground MTR stations, the Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort stations are not air conditioned, and rely on their open architecture to keep the temperature low.

The station is primarily used to travel to Hong Kong Disneyland, with an interchange from the Tung Chung line onto the Disneyland Resort line, but also provides bus transport links to the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge and Discovery Bay. The passes through the centre of the station without stopping. This station is equipped with emergency platforms for the Airport Express.

==History==
The Tung Chung line began operations on 22 June 1998, shortly followed by the Airport Express two weeks later on 6 July. However, Sunny Bay station was not built at the time.

On 1 June 2005, in order to prepare for the opening of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, Sunny Bay station was opened initially for the staff of the resort. Two months later, on 1 August 2005, Disneyland Resort line also opened to the public.

==Station layout==

Platforms 1 (Tung Chung line towards Tung Chung) and 3 (Disneyland Resort line) are located opposite to each other to allow easy interchange of trains for passengers travelling from the urban areas. Architecture firm Aedas was the architect for the Disneyland Resort line and the architect for the Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort stations.

Passengers travelling from Hong Kong can disembark and board Disneyland Resort trains departing from the opposite platform. Passengers returning from Disneyland Resort must cross a footbridge to reach platform 2 to board Tung Chung line trains heading towards Hong Kong. The exit gates are located on the same level and on the same side of the rail tracks as Platform 2.

==Entrance/exit==
*A: Transport interchange

Situated in reclaimed land near Yam O, the area is uninhabited and the sole exit leads to an emergency car park and transport interchange. As of 2005, the interchange is solely used by residents of Discovery Bay as the only bus routes run from the interchange to Discovery Bay, and as of late 2018, local passengers use this station in order to change for border route B5 (operated by Citybus) in order to change for buses to Macau and Zhuhai.

<doc id="1031530" wikidata="Q4800159" url="?curid=1031530" title="Arthur Rock">
<text>Arthur Rock (born August 19, 1926) is an American businessman and investor. Based in Silicon Valley, California, he was an early investor in major firms including Intel, Apple, Scientific Data Systems and Teledyne.

==Early life==
Rock was born and raised in Rochester, New York, in a Jewish family. He was an only child and his father owned a small candy store where Rock worked in his youth. He joined the U.S. Army during World War II but the war ended before he was deployed. He then went to college on the G.I. Bill. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from Syracuse University in 1948 and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1951.

==Career==
Rock started his career in 1951 as a securities analyst in New York City, and then joined the corporate finance department of Hayden, Stone &amp; Company in New York, where he focused on raising money for small high-technology companies. In 1957, when the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; left Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, Rock was the one who helped them find a place to go: he convinced Sherman Fairchild to start Fairchild Semiconductor.

In 1961, he moved to California. Along with Thomas J. Davis Jr., he formed the San Francisco venture capital firm Davis &amp; Rock.

In 1968, Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and another Fairchild employee named Andy Grove, were ready to start a new company, Intel. Noyce contacted his good friend Rock, with whom he used to hike and camp. Rock described how Intel started:

Bob [Noyce] just called me on the phone. We&#x27;d been friends for a long time.… Documents? There was practically nothing. Noyce&#x27;s reputation was good enough. We put out a page-and-a-half little circular, but I&#x27;d raised the money even before people saw it.

Intel was incorporated in Mountain View, California, on July 18, 1968, by chemist Gordon E. Moore (known for &quot;Moore&#x27;s law&quot;), Robert Noyce, a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit. Of the original 500,000 shares, Noyce held 245,000, Moore 245,000, and Rock 10,000; all at $1 per share. Rock raised $2.5 million of convertible debentures from a limited group of private investors in one day. Rock became Intel&#x27;s first chairman.

In 1978, Mike Markkula of Apple Computer hooked up Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Rock. Rock bought 640,000 shares of Apple Computer and became a long-time director of the company.

Rock&#x27;s investments and personal guidance helped launch and govern a roster of corporate firms including Intel, Apple, Scientific Data Systems, Teledyne, Xerox, Argonaut Insurance, AirTouch, the Nasdaq Stock Market, and Echelon Corporation.

== Venture capital ==

During the 1950s, putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to complete the transaction. It was a business that was growing very rapidly, and as the business grew, the transactions grew exponentially. Rock, one of the pioneers of Silicon Valley during his venturing the Fairchild Semiconductor is often credited with the introduction of the term &quot;venture capitalist&quot; that has since become widely accepted.

== Rock&#x27;s law ==

Rock&#x27;s law or Moore&#x27;s second law, named for Arthur Rock and Gordon Moore, respectively, says that the cost of a semiconductor chip fabrication plant doubles every four years. As of 2023, the price had already reached about US$20 billion.

Rock&#x27;s law can be seen as the economic flip side to Moore&#x27;s (first) law – that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years. The latter is a direct consequence of the ongoing growth of the capital-intensive semiconductor industry— innovative and popular products mean more profits, meaning more capital available to invest in ever higher levels of large-scale integration, which in turn leads to the creation of even more innovative products.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2003, Rock donated $25 million to the Harvard Business School to establish the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship. He and his wife Toni founded the Arthur &amp; Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University. Mr. Rock was co-founder and past president of The Basic Fund which gives scholarships to inner city children to attend K-8 private schools. He is also on the board of Teach for America and Children&#x27;s Scholarship Fund and an active funder of KIPP

Rock has donated to many political causes, especially in the area of education. He has donated to more than 30 school board elections across the country. In 2021, he donated over $500,000 to the 2022 San Francisco Board of Education recall elections.

<text>Linuxconf was a system configuration tool for the Linux operating system. It features different user interfaces: a text interface or a graphical user interface in the form of a Web page or native application. Most Linux distributions consider it deprecated compared to other tools such as Webmin, the system-config-* tools on Red Hat Enterprise Linux/Fedora, drakconf on Mandriva, YaST on openSUSE and so on. Linuxconf was deprecated from Red Hat Linux in version 7.1 in April 2001.

It was created by Jacques Gélinas of Solucorp, a company based in Québec.

<text>Edwin Vladimir Miranda (born January 28, 1981) is a retired Salvadoran footballer.

==Career==
===College===
Miranda grew up in Los Angeles, California, and played four years of college soccer at Cal State-Northridge, where he was twice named Big West Conference Defender of the Year.

===Professional===
Miranda was drafted in the sixth round (54th overall) by Dallas Burn in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. Miranda was unable work his way into the Dallas first team squad, and transferred to the Portland Timbers of the USL First Division for the 2004 season. After two seasons with the Timbers, Miranda transferred to the Puerto Rico Islanders.

In early 2009 it was announced that the Islanders and Miranda had decided to mutually part ways, as they could not come to an agreement as to the players salary. On April 12, 2009, Miranda signed a one-year contract with USL First Division team Miami FC, and played 25 games before being released at the end of the season.

He signed for the Hollywood United Hitmen of the USL Premier Development League in 2010, and played in 16 games for the team, helping them to the 2010 PDL playoffs. Following the conclusion of the 2010 PDL season Miranda returned to the Puerto Rico Islanders, playing four regular season games for &quot;Tropa Naranja&quot; towards the end of their successful championship-winning USSF D-2 Pro League campaign.

Miranda signed with USL Pro club Los Angeles Blues on April 7, 2011. He scored one goal in 18 games for the Blues, but was released by the team following the conclusion of the 2011 USL Pro season, and subsequently signed to play for the Los Angeles Misioneros in the USL Premier Development League in 2012. He made his debut for his new club on April 22, a 4-1 opening-day loss to Fresno Fuego.

===International===
Miranda received his first called up to the El Salvador national football team in December 2008. He received his first cap on January 24, 2009, in a UNCAF Nations Cup match against Belize when he came on as a late sub for Salvador Coreas.

==Honors==

<text>The Bushido Blade is a 1981 film directed by Tom Kotani. Sonny Chiba, Toshiro Mifune, Mako, Laura Gemser, James Earl Jones and Richard Boone in his last film appearance appear in this film. It was filmed in 1978, but not released until 1981.

== Plot ==
&quot;The Bushido Blade&quot; is a fictional sideline to the true events surrounding the treaty Commodore Matthew Perry signed with the shogun of feudal Japan. The samurai sword entrusted to Commodore Perry for President Franklin Pierce of the United States by the Emperor of Japan is stolen by factions wishing to maintain Japanese isolationism. The sword is stolen by Baron Zen, who is a servant of Lord Yamato, who opposes the Convention of Kanagawa about to be signed.

Commodore Akira Hayashi is told to recover the sword and, as a matter of honor, not sign the treaty until it is recovered. Prince Ido has received Hayashi&#x27;s order to regain the sword and goes to the castle of Yamato alone. Similarly, Perry has ordered Captain Lawrence Hawk to retrieve the sword. Hawk brings Midshipman Robin Gurr and Crew Bos&#x27;n Cave Johnson. The three get separated and the movie centers on their stories.

<text>The .308 Winchester is a smokeless powder rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge widely used for hunting, target shooting, police, military, and personal protection applications globally. It is similar, but not identical, to the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge.

==History==
During the 1940s, the .300 Savage became the basis for experiments on behalf of the U.S. military that resulted in the development of the T65 series of experimental cartridges. The original experimental case design by the Frankford Arsenal was designated &quot;T65&quot; and was similar to the .300 Savage case, but with less taper. The experimental cases were made from standard .30-06 Springfield cases which gave a little less capacity than standard .300 Savage cases because the Frankford Arsenal cases had slightly thicker walls. The later T65 iterations were lengthened compared to the original T65 case and provided a ballistic performance roughly equal to the U.S. military .30-06 Springfield service cartridge. Over forty years of technical progress in the field of propellants allowed for similar service cartridge performance from a significantly shorter, smaller case with less case capacity.

Winchester saw a market for a civilian model of the late T65 series designs and introduced it in 1952, two years prior to the NATO adoption of the T65E5 experimental cartridge iteration under the &quot;7.62×51mm NATO&quot; designation, in 1954. Winchester branded the cartridge and introduced it to the commercial hunting market as the &quot;.308 Winchester&quot;. Winchester&#x27;s Model 70, Model 88 and Model 100 rifles were subsequently chambered for the new cartridge. Since then, the .308 Winchester has become the most popular short-action, big-game hunting cartridge worldwide. It is also commonly used for hunting, target shooting, metallic silhouette, bench rest target shooting, Palma shooting, metal matches, military sniping, and police sharpshooting. The relatively short case makes the .308 Winchester especially well-adapted for short-action rifles. When loaded with a bullet that expands, tumbles, or fragments in tissue, this cartridge is capable of high terminal performance.

==Cartridge dimensions==
The .308 Winchester has a 3.64 mL (56 gr H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt-action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions.

&quot;.308 Winchester maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions&quot;. All dimensions in millimeters (mm) and inches.

Americans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 = 20 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 305 mm (1 in 12 in), 4 grooves, Ø lands = 7.62 mm, Ø grooves = 7.82 mm, land width = 4.47 mm and the primer type is large rifle.
A 254 mm (1 in 10 in) twist rate is also commonly applied.

According to the official C.I.P. () rulings, the .308 Winchester can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P.-regulated countries, every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that .308 Winchester chambered arms in C.I.P.-regulated countries are currently (2008) proof tested at PE piezo pressure.

North American SAAMI maximum pressure for the .308 Winchester is .

==.308 Winchester vs. 7.62×51mm NATO==
Although originating from an identical preceding series of experimental cartridges, the commercial 1952 .308 Winchester and the military 1954 7.62×51mm NATO chamberings have evolved separately and are not identical. The .308 Winchester and military 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges are similar enough that they can be loaded into rifles chambered for the other round, but the .308 Winchester cartridges are typically loaded to higher pressures than 7.62×51mm NATO service cartridges. Even though the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute (SAAMI) does not consider it unsafe to fire the commercial .308 Winchester rounds in weapons chambered for the military 7.62×51mm NATO round, there is significant discussion about compatible chambers and pressures between the two cartridges based on powder loads, chamber dimensions and wall thicknesses in the web area of the military compared to commercial cartridge cases. As the chambers differ, accordingly the head space gauges used for the two chamberings differ.

==Usage and performance==
The .308 Winchester is considered a standard hunting cartridge in the United States. It has gained popularity in many countries as an exceptional cartridge for game in the medium- to large-sized class. Although in North America it is commonly thought that it is only recommended for whitetail deer, pronghorn and the occasional caribou or black bear, the .308 Winchester is among the calibers recommended for hunting brown and grizzly bears by the Alaska Department of Game and Fish. Moreover, the Canadian Arctic Rangers chose the Colt Canada C19 in .308 Winchester/7.62×51mm NATO for &quot;polar bear defense&quot; in 2014; demonstrating that the .308 Winchester is suitable and even preferred for taking any medium, large or dangerous game located in the Americas.

Clay Harvey, an American gun writer, said the .308 Winchester is usable on moose and elk. Layne Simpson, an American who has hunted in Sweden, said he is surprised at how many hunters there used the cartridge. Craig Boddington was told by a Norma Precision executive that the .308 Winchester was one of Norma&#x27;s best-selling calibers.

In Africa, the .308 Winchester is one of the most popular calibers among Bushveld hunters and is used on anything from duiker right up to the massive eland (a small and large African antelope respectively). Proponents of the hydrostatic shock theory contend that the .308 Winchester has sufficient energy to impart hydrostatic shock to living targets when rapidly expanding bullets deliver a high rate of energy transfer.

While .308 Winchester has traditionally been the most popular cartridge in the past, the development of lighter recoil chamberings with sufficient downrange energy, like the 7mm-08 Remington, .260 Remington, and 6.5 Creedmoor, is becoming more common for metallic silhouette shooting.

Palma shooting is a variant of full-bore target shooting done with a bolt-action rifle chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester firing match grade 155-grain bullets and using micrometer aperture iron sights out to 1,000 yards.

F-class is a variant of full-bore target rifle which permits optical telescopic sights and shooting rests at the front and rear, such as a bipod or bags. Competitions are fired at distances between 300 and 1,200 meters (or yards), and the targets are half the size of those used in traditional Palma shooting. Based on equipment, competitors can choose to compete in one of the two classes, open and standard:
F-TR (&quot;target&quot;, standard class): A restricted class which permits a scope, bipod, backpack and rear bag (no front rest), the caliber has to be either .223 Remington or .308 Winchester. In addition, the weight limit including optics is 8.25 kg (18.15 lbs.).

The .308 Winchester has slightly more drop at long range than the .30-06 Springfield, owing to its slightly lower (around ) muzzle velocity with most bullet weights. Cartridges with significantly higher muzzle velocities, such as the .300 Winchester Magnum can have significantly less drop at long range, but much higher recoil.

==As a parent case==
Several cartridges have been developed using the .308 Winchester as a parent case, some becoming very popular for hunting, particularly in North America. These are the .243 Winchester, the .260 Remington (6.5-08 A-Square), the 7 mm-08 Remington, the .338 Federal, and the .358 Winchester (8.8×51mm). In 1980, two rimmed cartridges based on the .308 Winchester were introduced for use in the Winchester Model 94 XTR angle eject rifle: the .307 Winchester and the .356 Winchester. In 2014, the rimless 45 Raptor was introduced to provide a big bore cartridge for the AR-10 by combining the .308 Winchester with the .460 S&amp;W Magnum.

<doc id="1031547" wikidata="Q2595747" url="?curid=1031547" title="Bushido Blade (video game)">
<text>is a fighting video game developed by Lightweight and published by Square for the PlayStation. The game features one-on-one armed combat. Its name refers to the Japanese warrior code of honor &quot;bushidō&quot;.

Upon its release, the realistic fighting engine in &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; was seen as innovative, particularly the game&#x27;s unique Body Damage System. A direct sequel, &quot;Bushido Blade 2&quot;, was released on the PlayStation a year later. Another game with a related title and gameplay, &quot;Kengo: Master of Bushido&quot;, was also developed by Lightweight for the PlayStation 2.

==Gameplay==

The bulk of the gameplay in &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; revolves around one-on-one third-person battles between two opponents. Unlike most fighting games, however, no time limit or health gauge is present during combat. Most hits will cause instant death, while traditional fighting games require many hits to deplete an opponent&#x27;s health gauge. It is possible to wound an opponent without killing them. With the game&#x27;s &quot;Body Damage System,&quot; opponents are able to physically disable each other in increments with hits from an equipped weapon, slowing their attacking and running speed, or crippling their legs, forcing them to crawl.

The game features eight weapons to choose from in many of its modes: katana, nodachi, long sword, saber, broadsword, naginata, rapier, and sledgehammer. Except the European weapons, which are noticeably shorter than historical counterparts, each weapon has a realistic weight and length, giving each one fixed power, speed, and an ability to block. A variety of attack combinations can be executed by the player using button sequences with the game&#x27;s &quot;Motion Shift System,&quot; where one swing of a weapon is followed through with another. Many of these attacks are only available in one of three stances, switched using the shoulder buttons or axis controls depending on controller layout: high, neutral, and low. The player also has a choice of six playable characters. Similar to the weapons, each one has a different level of strength and speed, and a number of unique special attacks. Some characters have a subweapon that can be thrown as well. All the characters have differing levels of proficiency with the selectable weapons and have a single preferred weapon.

Characters in &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; also have the ability to run, jump, and climb within the 3D environments. Because battles are not limited to small arenas, the player is encouraged to freely explore during battle. The castle compound which most of the game takes place in acts as a large hub area of interconnected smaller areas including a cherry blossom grove, a moat, and a bridge labyrinth. Some areas, such as the bamboo thicket, allow some interaction.

The story mode of &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; adds another gameplay mechanic: the Bushido code. Certain moves and tactics are considered dishonorable, such as striking a foe in the back, throwing dust in their eyes, or attacking while they bow at the start of fights. Acting dishonorably will abruptly end the player&#x27;s playthrough after a certain point in the story, displaying a message berating them on their behavior.

In addition to the game&#x27;s single player story mode, &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; contains a two-player versus mode and a link mode that supports the PlayStation Link Cable. Other single player options include a practice mode and a first person mode. Slash mode pits the player&#x27;s katana-wielding character against a long string of 100 enemies, one after the other.

==Plot==
Despite characters, themes and weapons similar to samurai cinema set in Feudal Japan, &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; takes place during the modern era (this is shown, for example, when the player reaches a helicopter landing pad phase set in a large city).

A fictional 500-year-old dojo known as Meikyokan lies within this region, and teaches the disciplines of the master Narukagami Shinto. A society of assassins known as Kage (&quot;Shadow&quot;) also resides within the dojo. Once led by the honorable swordsman Utsusemi, he lost his position to Hanzaki, another skilled member of the dojo, in a fierce battle. Hanzaki gained respect as the Kage leader, until he discovered a cursed sword known as Yugiri. He began to change, disregarding the group&#x27;s honor and the traditions held by its students.

One day, a Kage member escapes the confines of the dojo with its secrets. Several other members of the society, under penalty of death, are sent to dispatch the defector, only catching up to him (or her) within the ruins of the surrounding Yin and Yang Labyrinth Castle. In single player mode the players take on the role of the escaped assassin (independent of whatever character they choose), fighting their way out by killing their comrades one by one. Elements of the game story differ with each character selected.

==Development==
&quot;Bushido Blade&quot; was the first title developed by Lightweight, a partially-owned subsidiary of the game&#x27;s publisher Square at the time of its release. The project was directed by Shuhiko Nakata, who wished to add tension to the traditional fighting game formula by having the possibility of a one-hit kill. However, Nakata stated that hit detection was implemented for the torso, head, and limbs to make the game more of a &quot;swordsmanship simulator&quot; rather than a fighting game. The director explained that the &quot;bushidō&quot; code of honor present in the game was not strictly the warrior&#x27;s &quot;way of dying&quot; like that found in the Edo period&#x27;s famous &quot;Hagakure&quot; guide but emphasized the concept of one&#x27;s own survival as found in teachings of earlier Japanese time periods.

The musical score for &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; was created by Namco and Arika composer Shinji Hosoe with contributions by Ayako Saso and Takayuki Aihara. Much of the audio utilizes the flute and violin, as well as a traditional Japanese instrument, the shamisen. The music was released with the soundtrack for Square&#x27;s &quot;Driving Emotion Type-S&quot;, also composed by the trio, on a two-disc set in 2001. The &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; disc contains 23 tracks. Unlike many other Square soundtracks of the era which were released by DigiCube, the music, copyrighted by Hosoe, was published by his own Super Sweep Records company. &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; also uses voice acting from voice actors such as Chikao Ōtsuka, Makio Inoue, and Hidekatsu Shibata.

===Release===
Originally slated for a February 1997 release in Japan, &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; was pushed back to March to make room for the debut of Square&#x27;s Aques line of sports games in February. &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; was presold in convenience stores in Japan prior to its release, similar to Square&#x27;s decision to presell its hit &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in Lawson stores.

The North American release of &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; had one minor graphical change: blood was added, replacing the yellow flash that appears during a fatal blow. Despite the North American-exclusive inclusion of graphic violence, the ESRB rated the game Teen, while the ELSPA gave the European release a more restrictive 18+ rating.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; was the 25th best selling game of 1997 in Japan, selling nearly 387,937 copies. The game was later reprinted, along with a handful of other Square Enix titles, under the developer&#x27;s &quot;Legendary Hits&quot; label. The game was also added to the PSone Classics roster on the Japanese PlayStation Store in 2008. In the United States, the game sold 324,083 units , adding up to units sold in Japan and the United States .

&quot;Bushido Blade&quot; was critically well received, primarily for the innovation of its combat system. The one-hit kills drew the most commentary, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; calling them &quot;Bushido Blade&#x27;s most exciting and preposterous feature, destined to earn it just as many fans as detractors&quot;. In an example of this, three of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s four reviewers gave the game a 7 out of 10 or lower, contending that the appeal of its innovation quickly wears off and that the one-hit kills can make victory or defeat arbitrary when unskilled players are involved, while the fourth reviewer, Crispin Boyer, gave it a 9 out of 10, applauding how the one-hit kills create a dynamic where &quot;survival depends on your level of concentration rather than how well you&#x27;ve memorized long strings of button taps. You must watch your opponents, read their posture and predict how they&#x27;ll strike.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; found the realism of the fighting system in general to be a love-or-hate point, arguing, &quot;[that] you must learn restraint and discipline in order to win ... is a concept that will not go over well with the &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; generation who just want a butt-kickin&#x27; good time.&quot; However, most reviewers soundly approved of the fighting system. &quot;IGN&quot; said it was &quot;extremely innovative, yet still not so ambitious as to have lost the point.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; similarly opined, &quot;&quot;Bushido Blade&quot; is a bold undertaking, but a remarkably successful one.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;Given that Square has chosen to take a much more realistic approach to blade combat than most fighters, it could be argued that &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; is the kind of game you either love or hate. However, while it may not offer the same arcade-style button mashing or twenty hit combos of other 3D brawlers, it does offer the closest you can get to the real thing without actually getting cut.&quot;

Other subjects of praise for the game were the detailed graphics, continuous arenas, ability to disable opponents&#x27; limbs, and the way the amount of honor the player shows in combat affects the ending. However, some reviewers complained that trees and other objects sometimes obscure the player&#x27;s view of the action.

In 1999, &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Console Fighting Game of the Year&quot; during the AIAS&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards. In November 2000, &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; was voted by the readers of &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; magazine as number 85 in its top 100 PlayStation games of all time. In 2006, the game was ranked number 190 on 1UP.com&#x27;s list of The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time. In 2010, GamesRadar included &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; on the list of the seven &quot;&#x27;90s games that need HD remakes&quot;.

<doc id="1031553" wikidata="Q6679001" url="?curid=1031553" title="Lord Buckley">
<text>Lord Richard Buckley (born Richard Myrle Buckley; April 5, 1906 – November 12, 1960) was an American stand-up comedian and recording artist, who in the 1940s and 1950s created a character that was, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;an unlikely persona ... part English royalty, part Dizzy Gillespie.&quot;

Michael Packenham, writing in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, described him as &quot;a magnificent stand-up comedian... Buckley&#x27;s work, his very presence, projected the sense that life&#x27;s most immortal truths lie in the inextricable weaving together of love and irony—affection for all humanity married to laughter.&quot;

Buckley&#x27;s unique stage persona anticipated aspects of the Beat Generation sensibility, and influenced contemporary figures as varied as Dizzy Gillespie, Lenny Bruce, Wavy Gravy, Del Close, and, even after Buckley&#x27;s death, Ken Kesey, George Harrison, Tom Waits, Frank Zappa, Robin Williams, and Jimmy Buffett. Bob Dylan, in his book &quot;Chronicles&quot;, said &quot;Buckley was the hipster bebop preacher who defied all labels.&quot;

==Early life==
Buckley&#x27;s father, William Buckley, was from Manchester, England. He stowed away on a ship that eventually arrived in San Francisco. In California, William met Annie Bone. They married, and their son, Richard, was born in Tuolumne, a small town near Sonora, in a mountainous region where lumbering was a major industry. As children, Buckley and his sister, Nell, would often perform on the streets of Tuolumne, singing for coins from passersby. When he was a bit older, Buckley got a job in the local lumber camps as a &quot;tree topper,&quot; which was considered an especially dangerous position. It involved climbing up to the very top of a tall tree, cutting off the tip and then securing ropes that would guide the rest of the tree as it was felled.

After quitting his job in Tuolumne, he travelled to Mexico to work in the oilfields. He moved to Galveston, Texas where he got a job at the Million Dollar Aztec Theatre.

==Career==
By the mid-1930s, he was performing as emcee in Chicago at Leo Seltzer&#x27;s dance marathons at the Chicago Coliseum, In the late 1930s he worked for Al Capone, who described Buckley as &quot;the only person who can make me laugh&quot;. Capone set up Buckley with his own club, &quot;Chez Buckley&quot;, on Western Avenue where he performed through the early 1940s. During World War II, Buckley performed extensively for armed services on USO tours, where he formed a lasting friendship with Ed Sullivan.

In the 1950s, Buckley hit his stride with a combination of exaggeratedly aristocratic bearing and carefully enunciated rhythmic hipster slang. He was known for wearing a waxed mustache along with white tie and tails. He sometimes wore a pith helmet. Occasionally performing to music, he punctuated his monologues with scat singing and sound effects. His most significant tracks are retellings of historical or legendary events, like &quot;My Own Railroad&quot; and &quot;The Nazz&quot;. The latter, first recorded in 1952, describes Jesus&#x27; working profession as &quot;carpenter kitty.&quot; Other historical figures include Gandhi (&quot;The Hip Gahn&quot;) and the Marquis de Sade (&quot;The Bad-Rapping of the Marquis de Sade, the King of Bad Cats&quot;). He retold several classic documents such as the Gettysburg Address and a version of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven.&quot; In &quot;Mark Antony&#x27;s Funeral Oration&quot;, he recast Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears&quot; as &quot;Hipsters, flipsters, and finger-poppin&#x27; daddies: knock me your lobes.&quot;
Reportedly, some of his comic material was written for him by Hollywood &quot;beatnik&quot; actor Mel Welles.

Lord Buckley appeared on Groucho Marx&#x27;s popular TV program &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; in 1956. In 1959, he voiced the beatnik character Go Man Van Gogh in &quot;Wildman of Wildsville&quot;, an episode of the Bob Clampett animated series &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;. (The character reappeared in several episodes made after Buckley&#x27;s death, when he was voiced by Scatman Crothers.)

Buckley adopted his &quot;hipsemantic&quot; delivery from his peers Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Redd Foxx, Pearl Mae Bailey, Count Basie, and Frank Sinatra, as well as Hipsters and the British aristocracy.

Buckley enjoyed smoking marijuana. He wrote reports of his first experiences with LSD, under the supervision of Dr. Oscar Janiger, and of his trip in a United States Air Force jet.

==Personal life==
Lord Buckley claimed to have been married six times. He had a son, Fred Buckley. His final marriage was to dancer Elizabeth Hanson (whom he referred to in public as &quot;Lady Buckley&quot;), with whom he had a daughter Laurie (b. 1951) and a son Richard (b. 1952).

==Death==
In the autumn of 1960, Buckley&#x27;s manager Harold L. Humes organized a series of club dates in New York City, and arranged for him to make another appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (that was broadcast from the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York). However, on October 19, 1960, while Buckley was making a public appearance at the Jazz Gallery in St. Mark&#x27;s Place in Manhattan, the New York Police Department (NYPD) stopped him over allegations he had &quot;falsified information&quot; on his application to get a New York City cabaret card; specifically he had omitted to record a 1941 arrest for marijuana possession. Cabaret cards had been a legal requirement since Prohibition for anyone, including performers, who wished to work in New York&#x27;s nightclubs or the entertainment industry. Because working without a license could mean arrest, revoking cards could permanently end careers – a threat that had been used in the past for political purposes or to solicit payoffs from performers.

At a hearing two days later to have his card reinstated, Buckley was supported by more than three dozen major figures in the entertainment and arts world. However, it developed into a confrontation between NYPD Commissioner Stephen P. Kennedy and Buckley&#x27;s friends and supporters, including Quincy Jones, George Plympton, and Norman Mailer.

Three weeks later, on November 12, 1960, Buckley died from a stroke at New York City&#x27;s Columbus Hospital. His funeral was at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel at 81st Street and Madison Avenue in New York City on November 16, 1960. Buckley was cremated at the Ferndale Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. The scandal of Buckley&#x27;s death, partially attributed to the seizure of his cabaret card, helped lead to the transfer of authority over cabaret cards from the police to the Licensing Department.

==Legacy==
Ed Sullivan reflected, &quot;he was impractical as many of his profession are, but the vivid Buckley will long be remembered by all of us.&quot;

&quot;The jingle-jangle morning&quot; in &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; is a phrase Bob Dylan said he took from Lord Buckley. from the line, &quot;Jingle jangle bells all over&quot;, in &quot;Scrooge.&quot;

Early in his career Dylan performed &quot;Black Cross&quot;, one of Lord Buckley&#x27;s signature pieces, originally written in 1948 by Joseph S. Newman. Dylan&#x27;s version is one of the tracks on the 1969 bootleg recording &quot;Great White Wonder&quot;.

Composer David Amram composed a concerto for alto saxophone and orchestra titled &quot;Ode to Lord Buckley&quot;, and dedicated it to Buckley&#x27;s memory.

Arlo Guthrie has cited Lord Buckley and Bill Cosby as the primary inspirations behind his song &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;.

George Harrison&#x27;s solo song &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot; was inspired by Buckley&#x27;s former home in Los Angeles. The song mentions Buckley in the line &quot;know well the Lord is well and inside of you,&quot; as well as Buckley&#x27;s manager George Grief.

Jimmy Buffett performed a version of Buckley&#x27;s &quot;God&#x27;s Own Drunk&quot; on his 1974 album &quot;Living and Dying in 3/4 Time&quot; and it became a signature piece for him until the release of &quot;Margaritaville&quot; in 1977. On his 1978 live album &quot;You Had to Be There&quot;, Buffett stated that the song is performed &quot;with much respect to Lord Richard Buckley.&quot; Buffett performed his version less frequently after being sued for copyright infringement by Buckley&#x27;s son in 1983. This lawsuit prompted the writing of &quot;The Lawyer and the Asshole.&quot;

George Carlin, during his acceptance speech at the Second Annual Comedy Hall Of Fame Awards, mentioned a long list of his comedy influences, and ended with &quot;the great, great, great Lord Buckley.&quot; This can be heard in the televised show.

A feature-length documentary, &quot;Too Hip for the Room: The Righteous Reign of Lord Buckley&quot; was released in 2016.

===Memorial===
On December 5, 1960, largely on the initiative of WEVD&#x27;s Mort Fega, a jazz memorial tribute to the late Buckley—as well as a benefit fundraiser for his widow and children—was held at the same venue in which he had last performed, the Jazz Gallery in New York. Participants included, among others, Ornette Coleman, Dizzy Gillespie, Dizzy Reece, Thelonious Monk, Ed Blackwell, Nick Stabulas, and Babs Gonzales, as well as comedians Orson Bean and Larry Storch. For the occasion, at least two original compositions were unveiled, with Gonzales debuting &quot;Old McDonald Did the Twist&quot; and Monk performing &quot;The Lord Buckley Blast.&quot;

===Samples in music===
Buckley&#x27;s work has been sampled by Jaylib and Madvillain.

* A quote from &#x27;The Gasser&#x27;, saying &quot;They didn&#x27;t know where they was going but they knew where they was, wasn&#x27;t it&quot;, was sampled in &quot;Everyday Robots&quot; by British singer and Blur frontman Damon Albarn, the lead single from his debut solo album of the same name. 
* Coldcut&#x27;s &quot;70 Minutes of Madness&quot; mix contains a sample of Buckley&#x27;s monologue on religion.
* Buckley&#x27;s &quot;hipsters, flipsters, and finger poppin&#x27; daddies&quot; line was sampled by The Waterboys in their song &quot;Where the Action Is.&quot;

==Discography==
Only four albums and three singles were released in his lifetime, but many collections have been released since, including:

<text>The Mathews Bridge is a cantilever bridge in Jacksonville, Florida, which spans the St. Johns River. Constructed in 1953, the bridge brings traffic along the Arlington Expressway between downtown Jacksonville and the Arlington neighborhood. It was named after John E. Mathews, a Florida state legislator and Chief Justice of the 1955 Florida Supreme Court who helped gather funding for the bridge&#x27;s construction. Originally silver in color, the bridge was painted garnet in 1984 in celebration of Jacksonville&#x27;s short-lived United States Football League franchise, the Jacksonville Bulls.

==History==

Discussion on building a bridge to Arlington and the beaches began in the early 20th century when cars became more popular. In 1938 Duval County Commission discontinued ferry service to help encourage support for a new bridge. At this time, only the Acosta Bridge and Main Street Bridge crossed the St. Johns River for vehicle use. Another reason for a new bridge was congestion on the two bridges. John E. Mathews, a state legislator and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, helped secure funding for a new bridge. The cost of constructing a bridge was $11 million to be backed by bonds and toll revenues. Tolls remained for the Mathews Bridge until 1989. The John E. Mathews Bridge opened on April 15, 1953.

The bridge had a notoriously problematic grating in the center span. After the previous grating wore out, a new one was installed, causing drivers to complain that the replacement was slippery and difficult to cross. That grating was replaced with a new, &quot;state of the art&quot; grating, which also provoked controversy causing citizens to pressure the Jacksonville City Council to act again concerning the grating. This initially only resulted in reducing the speed limit and roughing up the grating. In 2007, the bridge underwent a $12.9 million deck replacement project to replace the open grating over the center span with a concrete riding surface, and has since been reopened for public use.

In the early afternoon on September 26, 2013, the Military Sealift Command ship collided with the center span of the Mathews Bridge. The damage caused to the bridge was sufficient that it was closed indefinitely until it could be inspected and repaired. Following repairs, the Mathews Bridge reopened in the early morning of October 29, 2013.

Part of the reason of the accident was because the charted height of the bridge was incorrect. The bridge owners (Florida Department of Transportation) notified the Coast Guard that the bridge was surveyed and the new height was . This new measurement is lower than the previously published height.

No notification of the vessel&#x27;s height has been published by the Navy, but local news articles report that FDOT has evidence that the vessel&#x27;s height was also taller than its plans indicated.

<text>Martin Middlebrook (24 January 1932 – 19 January 2024) was an English military historian and author.

==Education and military service==
Middlebrook was educated at various schools, including Ratcliffe College, Leicester. He entered National Service in 1950, was commissioned in the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), and served as a Motor Transport Officer in the Suez Canal Zone and Aqaba, Jordan. Middlebrook subsequently spent three years in Territorial Army service.

==Career==
Middlebrook wrote his first book &quot;The First Day on the Somme&quot; (1971) following a visit to the First World War battlefields of France and Belgium in 1967. The book is a detailed study of the single worst day for the British Army. Middlebrook gave the same single-day treatment to 21 March 1918, the opening of the German spring offensive, in &quot;The Kaiser&#x27;s Battle&quot;. Middlebrook&#x27;s Second World War books concentrate on the air war. A number of them again deal with a single day of action (&quot;The Nuremberg Raid&quot;, &quot;The Schweinfurt–Regensburg Mission&quot; and &quot;The Peenemünde Raid&quot;) while others cover longer air battles (&quot;The Battle of Hamburg&quot; and &quot;The Berlin Raids&quot;). Middlebrook also wrote two books on the Falklands War, one from the British and Falkland Islanders&#x27; perspective and one from the Argentinian perspective.

==Death==
Middlebrook died in Cheltenham on 19 January 2024, at the age of 91.

==Honours==
Middlebrook was a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS). He was appointed Knight of the Order of the Belgian Crown in 2004.

<text>Sherry D. Jackson (born February 15, 1942) is an American retired actress and former child star.

==Early life==
Jackson was born on February 15, 1942, in  Wendell, Idaho. Her mother, Maurita, provided drama, singing, and dancing lessons for Sherry and her two brothers, Curtis L. Jackson, Jr., and Gary L. Jackson, beginning in their formative years. Her father, Curtis L. Jackson, Sr., died when she was 6, and Maurita moved the family from Wendell to Los Angeles, California.

By one account Maurita, who had been told while still in Idaho that her children should be in films, was referred to a theatrical agent by a tour bus driver whom they met in Los Angeles. According to another, she was referred by the friend of an agent who saw Sherry eating ice cream on the Sunset Strip. Apocryphal perhaps, but within the year Sherry had her first screen test, for &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; with Olivia de Havilland, and by the age of seven appeared in her first feature film, the 1949 musical &quot;You&#x27;re My Everything&quot;, which starred Anne Baxter and Dan Dailey.

In 1950, young Sherry became friends with actor Steve Cochran while working with him on &quot;The Lion and the Horse&quot;. Steve introduced his friend, writer Montgomery Pittman, to Sherry&#x27;s widowed mother. A romance developed, and Pittman married Maurita Jackson in a small ceremony on June 4, 1952, in Torrance, California, with Sherry as flower girl and younger brother Gary as ring-bearer; Cochran himself was Pittman&#x27;s best man. In 1955 Cochran hired Pittman to write his next film, &quot;Come Next Spring&quot;, the first that Cochran produced himself. Sherry played the part of Cochran&#x27;s mute daughter Annie Ballot, a role Pittman wrote specifically for his step-daughter.

During the course of appearing in several of the &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; movies during the 1950s as Susie Kettle, one of the titular couple&#x27;s numerous children, Jackson also appeared in &quot;The Breaking Point&quot;, which starred John Garfield in his penultimate film role. In 1952 she portrayed the emotionally volatile visionary and ascetic Jacinta Marto in &quot;The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima&quot; and the following year played John Wayne&#x27;s daughter in the football-themed &quot;Trouble Along the Way&quot;.

==&quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;==
Jackson played the older daughter Terry Williams on &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; (known as &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; during the first three seasons) from 1953 to 1958. During the course of her five years on the series, she established a strong bond with her on-screen mother, Jean Hagen, but Hagen left the series after the third season in 1956.

Worn out from the relentless pace of the production, Jackson left the program at the beginning of season six, once her five-year contract expired. To allow the writers to finish the character off, actress Penny Parker appeared in the role for fourteen episodes of season seven, in which the character gets married and moves away. Jackson&#x27;s impact on the &quot;Danny Thomas&quot; viewing audience was such that, on February 8, 1960, she received a star for &quot;Television&quot; at 6324 Hollywood Blvd. on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Jackson did return as Terry for the premiere episode of the new series &quot;Make Room for Granddaddy&quot; in 1970.

==Later roles==
Over the next few years, Jackson broadened her range of acting roles by guest starring in television series, appearing as a hit woman on &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, a freed Apache captive who yearns to return to the reservation on &quot;The Tall Man&quot;, an alcoholic on &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, a woman accused of murder on &quot;Perry Mason,&quot; and an unstable mother-to-be on &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. Sherry also appeared as a first season guest on &quot;The Rifleman&quot; episode “The Sister” playing the part of a horse riding sibling of two doting brothers. She played a gunslinger&#x27;s promiscuous young bride in the Western series &quot;Maverick&quot; episode entitled &quot;Red Dog&quot; with Roger Moore, Lee Van Cleef and John Carradine. After a 1965 appearance on &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, she then made guest appearances on &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (&quot;The Space Croppers&quot;, reuniting with her &quot;Danny Thomas&quot; co-star, Angela Cartwright), &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; (&quot;The Night of the Vicious Valentine&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Gruesome Games&quot;, as two different characters), &quot;Batman&quot;, and the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; (&quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;).

When Blake Edwards remade the television series &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; as a feature film entitled &quot;Gunn&quot; (1967), Jackson was filmed in a nude scene that appeared only in the international version, not the U.S. release. Stills of the nude scene appeared in the August 1967 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, in a pictorial entitled &quot;Make Room For Sherry&quot;. The movie has not been released on VHS or DVD.

In 1968 Jackson co-starred in &quot;The Mini-Skirt Mob&quot; as a member of an all-female motorcycle gang, and appeared in the 1973 film &quot;Cotter&quot; opposite Don Murray and Carol Lynley. In subsequent years she appeared in TV movies such as &quot;Wild Women&quot; (1970), &quot;Hitchhike!&quot; (1974), &quot;The Girl on the Late, Late Show&quot; (1974), &quot;Returning Home&quot; (1975), &quot;Enigma&quot; (1977), &quot;The Curse of the Moon Child&quot; (1977) and &quot;Casino&quot; (1980).

In the 1970s through early 1980s she made guest appearances on TV shows &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;The Blue Knight&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and &quot;CHiPs&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jackson dated Lance Reventlow while he was estranged from his wife Jill St. John. 

In 1967, she began a five-year relationship with business executive and horse breeder Fletcher R. Jones. On November 7, 1972, Jones was killed in a plane crash eight miles east of Santa Ynez Airport in Santa Barbara County, California. Five months after Jones&#x27;s death, Jackson filed a palimony suit against his estate, asking for more than $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ), with her attorneys stating that Jones had promised to provide her with at least $25,000 a year for the rest of her life.

Jackson has a star for broadcast television on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6324 Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="1031569" wikidata="Q1067173" url="?curid=1031569" title="Torrens title">
<text>Torrens title is a land registration and land transfer system in which a state creates and maintains a register of land holdings, which serves as the conclusive evidence (termed &quot;indefeasibility&quot;) of title of the person recorded on the register as the proprietor (owner), and of all other interests recorded on the register.

Ownership of land is transferred by registration of a transfer of title, instead of by the use of deeds. The Registrar provides a Certificate of Title to the new proprietor, which is merely a copy of the related folio of the register. The main benefit of the system is to enhance certainty of title to land and to simplify dealings involving land.

Its name derives from Sir Robert Richard Torrens (1812–1884), who designed, lobbied for and introduced the private member&#x27;s bill which was enacted as the &quot;Real Property Act 1858&quot; in the province of South Australia, the first version of Torrens title enacted in the world. Torrens based his proposal on many of the ideas of Ulrich Hübbe, a German lawyer living in South Australia. The system has been adopted by many countries and has been adapted to cover other interests, including credit interests (such as mortgages), leaseholds and strata titles.

==Overview==
The Torrens title system operates on the principle of &quot;title by registration&quot; (granting the high indefeasibility of a registered ownership) rather than &quot;registration of title&quot;. The system does away with the need for proving a chain of title (&quot;i.e.&quot;, tracing title back in time through a series of documents). The State guarantees title, and the system is usually supported by a compensation scheme for those who lose their title due to private fraud or error in the State&#x27;s operation.

In most jurisdictions, there will be parcels of land which are still unregistered.

The Torrens system works on three principles:
# Mirror principle – the register reflects (mirrors) accurately and completely the current facts about title to each registered lot. This means that each dealing affecting a lot (such as a transfer of title, a mortgage or discharge of same, a lease, an easement or a covenant) must be entered on the register and so be viewable by anyone.
# Curtain principle – one does not need to go behind the Certificate of Title as it contains all the information about the title. This means that ownership need not be proved by long complicated documents that are kept by the owner, as in the Private Conveyancing system. All of the necessary information regarding ownership is on the Certificate of Title.
# Indemnity principle – provides for compensation of loss caused by private fraud or by errors made by the Registrar of Titles.

==Background==
===Common law===
At common law, the vendor of land needs to show his or her ownership of the land by tracing the chain of ownership back to the earliest grant of land by the Crown to its first owner. The documents relating to transactions with the land are collectively known as the &quot;title deeds&quot; or the &quot;chain of title&quot;. This event may have occurred hundreds of years prior and could have had dozens of intervened changes in the land&#x27;s ownership. A person&#x27;s ownership over land could also be challenged, potentially causing great legal expense to land owners and hindering development.

Even an exhaustive title search of the chain of title would not give the purchaser complete security, largely because of the principle, &quot;nemo dat quod non habet&quot; (&quot;no one gives what he does not have&quot;) and the ever-present possibility of undetected outstanding interests. For example, in the UK Court of Chancery case &quot;Pilcher v Rawlins&quot; (1872), the vendor conveyed the fee-simple estate to P1, but retained the title deeds and fraudulently purported to convey the fee-simple estate to P2. The latter could receive only the title retained by the vendor—in short, nothing. However, the case was ultimately decided in favor of P2, over P1. The courts of equity could not bring themselves to decide against a totally innocent (without notice) purchaser.

The common-law position has been changed in minor respects by legislation designed to minimize the searches that should be undertaken by a prospective purchaser. In some jurisdictions, a limitation has been placed on the period of commencement of title a purchaser may require.

===Deeds registration===
The effect of registration under the deeds registration system (also known as &quot;record title&quot;) was to give the instrument registered &quot;priority&quot; over all instruments that are either unregistered or not registered until later. The recording of the deed served to give notice to the world of the conveyance of title to the grantee named in the deed. The basic difference between the deeds registration and Torrens systems is that the former involves registration of instruments while the latter involves registration of title.

Moreover, though a register of who owned what land was maintained, it was unreliable and could be challenged in the courts at any time. The limits of the deeds-registration system meant that transfers of land were slow, expensive, and often unable to create certain title.

==Creation==
Sir Robert Richard Torrens, Registrar-General and Treasurer of the colony of South Australia and later a member of the House of Assembly, lobbied for many years for a new title system to improve the currently cumbersome, slow and expensive system of land transfer. He was largely responsible for shepherding the new Bill through Parliament, enacted in 1858 as the &quot;Real Property Act 1858&quot;. The system laid out in this bill became known as the Torrens title system, and was based on a central registry of all the land in the jurisdiction of South Australia.

Torrens drew ideas from the system of registration of merchant ships in the United Kingdom, experience gained from his years of working as a customs official. He also used many of the ideas incorporated in the Act from Ulrich Hübbe, a German lawyer living in South Australia at that time, who had expert knowledge of the Hanseatic registration system in Hamburg.

==Land register==

The central aspect of the Torrens system is the land register, in which all dealings with land are recorded. The register may be a bound paper record, but today most registers are typically kept in a database. Ownership of the land is established by virtue of the owner&#x27;s name being recorded in the government&#x27;s register. The Torrens title also records easements and the creation and discharge of mortgages.

On the first registration of land under the system, the land is given a unique number (called a volume-folio number) which identifies the land by reference to a registered plan. The folio records the dimensions of the land and its boundaries, the name of the registered owner, and any legal interests that affect title to the land. To change the boundaries of a parcel of land, a revised plan must be prepared and registered. Once registered, the land cannot be withdrawn from the system.

A transfer of ownership of a parcel of land is effected by a change of the record on the register. The registrar has a duty to ensure that only legally valid changes are made to the register. To this end, the registrar will indicate what documentation he or she will require to be satisfied that there has in fact been a change of ownership. A change of ownership may come about because of a sale of the land, or the death of the registered owner, or as a result of a court order, to name only the most common ways that ownership may change. Similarly, any interest which affects or limits the ownership rights of the registered owner, such as a mortgage, can also be noted on the register. There are legal rules which regulate the rights and powers of each of these interests in relation to each other and in relation to third parties.

The State guarantees the accuracy of the register and undertakes to compensate those whose rights are adversely affected by an administrative error. Claims for compensation are very rare.

==Effect of registration==

The main difference between a common law title and a Torrens title is that a member of the general community, acting in good faith, can rely on the information on the land register as to the rights and interests of parties recorded there, and act on the basis of that information. A prospective purchaser, for example, is not required to look beyond that record. He or she does not need even to examine the Certificate of Title, the register information being paramount. This contrasts with a common law title, which is based on the principle that a vendor cannot transfer to a purchaser a greater interest than he or she owns. As with a chain, the seller&#x27;s title is as good as the weakest link of the chain of title. Accordingly, if a vendor&#x27;s common law title were defective in any way, so would be the purchaser&#x27;s title. Hence, it is incumbent on the purchaser to ensure that the vendor&#x27;s title is beyond question. This may involve both inquiries and an examination of the chain of title, which can be a protracted and costly exercise each time there is a dealing in the property.

The registered proprietor of Torrens land is said to have an indefeasible title, which means that his or her title can be challenged only in very limited circumstances (see following).

==Indefeasibility of title==

The register of titles is said to confer “indefeasibility of title” to the person or persons registered on the register as proprietor or joint proprietors of land. Although the concept of indefeasibility is similar to that of conclusive evidence, in practice there are some limitations to indefeasibility, and different jurisdictions have different laws and provisions.

For example, in the Australian state of Victoria, the Torrens system is manifested in the &quot;Transfer of Land Act 1958&quot; (Vic). Upon registration of an interest and subsequent recording on title of the interest, the registered owner&#x27;s claim to that interest is superior to all other claims other than those listed in s.42 of that Act, which provides that the title of the registered interest holder is subject to, &quot;inter alia&quot;:

* those listed on the title,
* those claiming the land on a prior folio (s.42(1)(a)), 
* where the land is included by wrong description on the part of the Registrar and the proprietor is not or has not derived title from a purchaser ‘for value’ (s.42(1)(b),
* “paramount interests” (s.42(2)(a)-(f)) – these interests, although even possibly unregistered, are &#x27;superior&#x27; to interests that are registered.

Additionally, there are other exceptions or circumstances that can defeat indefeasibility, such as:

* fraud committed by the registered interest holder [principle of immediate indefeasibility]. See, for example, the New Zealand case of &quot;Efstratiou, Glantschnig, and Petrovic v Glantschnig&quot;,
* judicial action, where it can be shown that there was some contractual promise or undertaking by the registered party &quot;&quot; the unregistered party,
* inconsistent legislation (in which case the most recent legislation prevails),
* volunteer, where the registering party acquires the interest for no consideration (e.g. bequeathed in a will). By contrast, in New South Wales volunteers are entitled to indefeasibility.

==Adoption==
The adoption of the Torrens title registry throughout the British Commonwealth, and its legal context, was covered in depth by James Edward Hogg in 1920.

===Australia===
The first sale of land registered under the system was to pastoralist William Ransom Mortlock (later elected to the South Australian House of Assembly) on 25 August 1858.

Starting in South Australia with the &quot;Real Property Act 1858&quot; (which was later repealed and replaced by the &quot;Real Property Act 1886&quot;), all Australian colonies introduced the Torrens system between 1858 and 1875. Since then, each colony, and since 1901, state or territory, has maintained its own land titles register of land.

The Torrens system did not replace the common law system but applied only to land grants effected after the introduction of the Torrens system in the jurisdiction and to land that was voluntarily registered under the relevant Act. In Australia most land is now held under the Torrens system, although remnants of the old system of land title still remain, called “General law land”. All land in the Australian Capital Territory is leasehold (effectively Torrens freehold), while much of the Northern Territory is held under Crown lease. Native Title is recognised as a separate form of ownership. Some land remains as Crown Land.

===Canada===
The second Torrens jurisdiction in the world was established in 1861 in the then-British colony of Vancouver Island, now part of the Canadian province of British Columbia. Canada, through the federal Parliament in 1886, implemented the Torrens system in the Northwest Territories. It has continued to be used by the three Prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) into which the southern part of the Northwest Territories was divided. British Columbia uses a modified Torrens system. Since 1885, Ontario has used an English system, which is not a Torrens system, but it has similar purposes. In Ontario, electronic registration led to this version covering almost all land, but the past deeds registration still governs some issues. For properties still under deeds registration, a 40-year rule governed title, but the government converted them under a streamlined process. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia converted from a Deeds registration system to a Torrens title system in the 2000s, with the expense of the changeover charged to the purchaser. The only provinces in Canada which do not have Torrens titles include Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec. Quebec uses the cadastre system under the civil law jurisdiction rather than the common law jurisdiction.

===Fiji===
Fiji&#x27;s Torrens statute is the Land Transfer Act 1971.

===Dominican Republic===
The Dominican Republic has been using the Torrens Title System since 1920. All of commercial property and most real estate within the main cities are registered and thus guaranteed under the system. An acceleration of registration for land in the rural areas is underway in the 21st century, to promote a more efficient and effective real estate market in the Dominican Republic.

===Ireland===
Ireland first began to operate a Torrens Title system in 1892. So-called registered land (i.e. land held under a Torrens title) is recorded in the Republic of Ireland using a system of numbered county-level folios. The land registry is operated by the Property Registration Authority, a government agency, and records both freehold and leasehold titles, along with easements/profits-a-prendre, mortgages, and any other charges over land. It is compulsory to create a folio in the land registry if land is sold/transferred/subdivided, multi-storey buildings are erected, or a new lease (over five years) is created. The vast majority of land in Ireland (by acreage) is held under Torrens title as compulsory registration in the land registry upon sale has been a requirement in rural areas for many years. Compulsory registration was extended to the (more urban) counties of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford in 2010, thus extending mandatory Torrens title to every part of the Republic of Ireland.

===Israel===

A Torrens title system was implemented by the British in Mandatory Palestine, and has continued in use since Israel&#x27;s foundation in 1948. As of 2016, about 4% of the country&#x27;s land area is still registered under a pre-Torrens, deeds registration system.

===Malaysia===
Malaysia has adopted three versions of the Torrens system:
*For Peninsular Malaysia, this is enacted in the National Land Code, Act 56 of 1965.
*For the state of Sarawak, this is enacted in the Sarawak Land Code, Chapter 81 of 1958.
*For the state of Sabah, this is enacted in the Land Ordinance (Sabah Chapter 68). Unlike the National Land Code and the Sarawak Land Code, the Land Ordinance (Sabah Chapter 68) does not provide any indefeasibility of title.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand adopted a similar system from 1870 under the &quot;Land Transfer Act, 1870&quot; The &quot;Land Transfer (Compulsory Registration of Titles) Act 1924&quot; brought most of the remaining land in the country under the Torrens system and by 1951 the register was considered complete, although small remnants of land may still exist under the deeds system. The Land Transfer Act 1952 further implemented the Torrens system. In the 20th century, academics and judges disagreed about whether to interpret indefeasibility as &quot;deferred&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot;. In 1967, the Privy Council in &quot;Frazer v Walker&quot; decided that a registered owner will obtain an indefeasible title to an interest or estate as soon as they become the registered owner of the interest or estate (the principle of immediate indefeasibility).

The 1952 Act was superseded by the &quot;Land Transfer Act 2017&quot;. The 2017 Act introduces a judicial discretion to cancel an owner&#x27;s registration of title in cases of &quot;manifest injustice&quot;, which arguably frustrates the certainty of title considered fundamental to the principle of immediate indefeasibility.

In New Zealand most land is held under the &quot;Torrens Title&quot; system, although remnants of the old system of land title still remain. &quot;Māori customary title&quot; (native title) is recognised as a separate form of ownership. Some land remains as Crown Land (i.e. in New Zealand, public land).

===Philippines===
The Torrens system was established in the Philippines on 6 November 1902, by the enactment of &quot;Act No. 496&quot;, &quot;The Land Registration Act&quot;, which was virtually identical to the Real Property Act of Massachusetts of 1898.

===Russia===
Russia adopted the Torrens system soon after the founding of the Soviet Union. Currently, the accounting and registration system for rights to immovable property in Russia is governed by two federal laws, which have adopted some of the elements and principles of the Torrens system. Accounting for land, buildings and natural sites is recorded in a database of real estate cadastre under federal law of 2007 No. 221-FZ &quot;On State Real Estate Cadastre&quot;. Transactions by the account holder of these facilities is recorded in another database: “the Unified State Register of rights to immovable property and transactions with them” on the basis of federal law of 1997 No. 122-FZ &quot;On State Registration of Rights to Real Estate and Transactions Therewith&quot;. Both laws established openness cadastre and registry information, and assigned to a single organization responsible for their management - Rosreestr . Entry in the Unified State Register of real property rights is a necessary and sufficient condition for the emergence of property rights to real estate. For information about the property, contained in the cadastre and registry, sufficiently detailed and structured cover most essential information about an object runs open cadastral map. With a fairly simple web forms can be found and read a part of the information on any object property. These laws are not, however, establish an immediate full liability of the state for the correctness of the information contained in databases.
In 2015, the State Duma has been registered a bill that covers public access to information about the owners of the property. The bill was supported by the Government. According to some experts, the restriction of information openness reduces the chances of identifying the public cases of illegal enrichment and increases business risks.

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia introduced a Torrens system in 2002 with The Realty in Kind Registration Law, issued by Royal Decree No. 6 on 9/21423H

===Singapore===
Singapore adopted a version of the Torrens system beginning in 1960 with the Land Titles Act, Chapter 157. Conversion of all titles was completed in 2001.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka has introduced a version of the Torrens system known as Bim Saviya under the &quot;Registration of Title Act No. 21 of 1998&quot;. The Survey Department of Sri Lanka had started the process of surveying government and private own land for the entry into the Bim Saviya registration. As of date the process has not finished in land surveying and converting land owners original deeds into &quot;Certificate of Titles&quot;. The program has become highly controversial, with claims that it mirrors the reclamation of crown land by the British colonial government of Ceylon under the &quot;Prevention of Encroachments upon Crown Lands Ordinance No 12 of 1840&quot; with the government taking over ownership of land its occupants cannot prove ownership of and the high possibility of fraud, lack of recognition of Certificate of Title issued under the Bim Saviya program and the lack of provisions for co-ownership.

===Thailand===
Thailand adopted the Torrens system in 1901 after King Chulalongkorn established The Royal Thai Survey Department, a Special Services Group of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, engaged in Cadastral survey, which is the survey of specific land parcels to define ownership for land registration, and for equitable taxation.

===United States===
Proposals to implement Torrens title systems in the United States have been strenuously opposed by the title insurance industry. The high initial cost of Torrens registration is another barrier to the system&#x27;s implementation.

The Torrens system is used in the U.S. territory of Guam. States with a limited implementation include Minnesota, Massachusetts, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, New York, North Carolina, and Ohio. Previously, Virginia and Washington implemented it, however the system has since been repealed in these states.

The state of Illinois was the first state to adopt a Torrens Title Act, which used a limited Torrens system in Cook County after the Great Chicago Fire, but the system was allowed to expire on 1 January 1992, after it was found to be unpopular with lenders and other institutions. 

California adopted the Torrens System in 1914 pursuant to an initiative statute. Although participation in the system was voluntary, once an owner had registered his land, he could not withdraw from the system. The Torrens System, as adopted in California, did not protect buyers from defects caused by federal tax liens, federal bankruptcy proceedings, or from incompetency, divorce, or probate proceedings affecting the seller. Since the system had been adopted by initiative, the legislature had no authority to correct those deficiencies. By an initiative adopted in 1954, the legislature was given authority to amend or repeal the system, and, in 1955, it was repealed.

Virginia enacted a Torrens system option. However, it never became popular and the Torrens Act was abolished in 2019. Record title is now the only form of land title registration in Virginia. Washington had voluntary Torrens registration until June 2022, at which time new registrations were discontinued. Existing registrations were terminated on 1 July 2023.

<text>Chasing Liberty is a 2004 romantic comedy film directed by Andy Cadiff, starring Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode and written by Derek Guiley and David Schneiderman.

The film is about the 18-year-old daughter of the President of the United States whose rebellion against the constant presence of Secret Service agents in her life leads to a European adventure and an unexpected romance.

It was filmed on location in Prague, Venice, Berlin, London, Chelmsford and Washington, D.C.

==Plot==
Anna Foster is the daughter of POTUS James Foster. After Secret Service agents ruin a first date, she demands less supervision. For his upcoming trip to Prague, the president agrees to assign only two agents to watch over Anna, whose Secret Service codename is Liberty.

In Prague, Anna and her friend Gabrielle Le Clerc attend a concert, where she spots numerous agents in the crowd. Believing her father has broken his promise, she eludes her protectors with Gabrielle&#x27;s help. Outside the theater, she asks Ben Calder for a ride on his motorbike. Unknown to Anna, he is a Secret Service agent, and he informs agents Alan Weiss and Cynthia Morales where she can be found. When the president learns of her behavior, he instructs Ben to guard her without revealing his identity, to give her the illusion of freedom while guaranteeing safety.

Believing she is finally free, Anna jumps into the Vltava River naked, mistaking it for the Danube, and she and Ben climb a rooftop to watch an Offenbach opera being shown in a plaza. The next morning, Anna calls her parents. Initially relieved his daughter is safe, the President&#x27;s tone changes when he is shown photos of her skinny-dipping.

Outraged at her father&#x27;s tone, Anna decides she will go to the Love Parade in Berlin. She and Ben board a train, where they meet Scotty McGruff, a flighty romantic backpacker who gives them a stack of &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; stickers, telling them to post them in random places. One day when they are unhappy, they may come across one and it will make them smile. Ben discovers that they have boarded a Venice-bound train going in the opposite direction from Berlin.

In Venice, after checking in with agents Weiss and Morales—who are now growing closer romantically—Ben joins Anna and McGruff and together they explore the city. McGruff disappears with Anna&#x27;s wallet, she is recognized by tourists and she and Ben flee.

With no money, they tell kind-hearted gondolier Eugenio that they recently eloped against her parents&#x27; wishes. During the free gondola ride, Ben kisses Anna to hide her from their pursuers. When he learns the &quot;newlyweds&quot; have no place to stay, Eugenio invites them to his house, where they are welcomed by his mother Maria. That night, thinking their kiss was heartfelt, Anna offers herself to Ben, but he rejects her advances.

The next day, Eugenio drives them to the Austrian border, as Weiss and Morales show up at Maria&#x27;s and are told that Anna and Ben are newlyweds, which is then reported to Anna&#x27;s parents, causing confusion. Upset at Ben&#x27;s rejection, Anna hitchhikes a ride in a truck, leaving him to chase her through the Austrian countryside. She comes to a bridge, where she meets the Jumping Germans, a bungee jumping group. Ben arrives just as Anna is being strapped into the harness, and insists on jumping with her.

Later that evening at the Jumping Germans&#x27; camp, one of them invites Anna to share his tent for the night. She refuses and flirts with Ben, who rejects her advances again. Upset, she declares that she will go to the German&#x27;s tent after all; Ben finally admits his feelings for Anna and they spend the night together.

At the Love Parade, as Ben explains his actions on the phone to his fellow agents, Anna overhears his identity. Enraged at the apparent betrayal, she runs off, only to be harassed by a group of men who recognize her. Ben rescues her, and Anna and her family return to the United States.

While preparing for college, Anna tells her mother her heart is &quot;a little bit broken.&quot; At college, with Weiss and Morales (who plan to marry) still protecting her, she sees a &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; sticker, reminding her of her European adventure.

During Christmas break Anna&#x27;s father tells her Ben resigned from the Secret Service and is working as a photographer in London. So, on an exchange program with Oxford University Anna visits him at the opera, where they kiss, reconcile, and escape on his motorbike.

==Production==
In November 2000, it was announced Alcon Entertainment had purchased &quot;Untitled First Daughter Project&quot; by screenwriters Derek Guiley and David Schneiderman with Andy Cadiff signed to direct.

===Story===
The storyline was directly inspired by Chelsea Clinton, who was photographed trying to blend in with other students at a Stanford basketball game.

The problem that Anna Foster (Moore) faces in the film—excessively protective Secret Service agents guarding children of United States Government officials—was previously explored in the 1980 comedy &quot;First Family,&quot; with Bob Newhart as the president.

The story in many ways echoes the 1953 romantic comedy &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; with Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn and Eddie Albert. Hepburn played a princess who slips away from her handlers to be squired around Rome, also on a motor scooter, by Peck, not realizing that he knows her identity and plans a magazine story. In both films, the leads are accompanied by a goofy friend, in this case played by Albert.

===Filming locations===
The exterior scenes of the White House were in fact filmed at Hylands House in Chelmsford, Essex, England, because of its resemblance to the White House. Blueprints of the White House were also used to create a digital replica, which helped make the exterior scenes look authentic.

* Prague, Czech Republic

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; opened on January 9, 2004, worldwide in 2,400 theatres, earning $6,081,483 on its opening weekend. It went on to gross $12,195,626 domestically with an additional $117,697 in international revenue, totaling $12,313,323 in worldwide gross earnings, failing to bring back its $23 million budget.

===Critical response===
The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; scored an 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 117 reviews, with a consensus that it was &quot;Formulaic comfort food for the teen crowd.&quot; Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; will probably win over as many fuddy-duddy fathers as fillies with its mixture of sweetness tempered with genial cynicism.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film a two out of four star rating and found it &quot;surprisingly good in areas where it doesn&#x27;t need to be good at all, and pretty awful in areas where it has to succeed.&quot; Ebert did appreciate Moore&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;Moore is just plain likeable, a slurpee blended from scoops of Mary Tyler Moore, Sally Field and Doris Day.&quot;

In his ReelViews review, James Berardinelli called &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; &quot;a fairly standard-issue teen romantic comedy.&quot;

In his review in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle wrote, &quot;&quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; is a kind of remake of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934), updated and retooled for a young audience that won&#x27;t recognize the connection.&quot; LaSalle applauds the film&#x27;s ability to evoke a young girl&#x27;s experience of being on her own for the first time, writing, &quot;Anna and Ben romp through Prague and, later, Venice, having adventures and misadventures and meeting various colorful characters, and it&#x27;s all quite engaging. We understand what this freedom means to Anna, partly thanks to Moore&#x27;s expressive intelligence, but also through director Andy Cadiff&#x27;s technique. We see a rock concert, a late-night outdoor screening of an operatic film and the splendors of historic cities through the eyes of a young girl experiencing them for the first time.&quot;

<text>Memoir &#x27;44 is a light wargame or war-themed strategy board game for two players. It was created by Richard Borg and published in 2004 by Days of Wonder. Illustration done by Julian Deveil and Cyrrile Dejuan. The game can be played with up to six players if played in teams and up to eight players in the &quot;Overlord&quot; scenarios. However, &quot;Overlord&quot; requires two copies of the game. It received the 2004 International Gamers Award for &quot;General Strategy, 2-Player&quot; category and The Wargamer 2004 &quot;Award for Excellence&quot;. The game is published in English and French (as Mémoire 44) by Days of Wonder.

&quot;Memoir &#x27;44&quot; simulates over a dozen of the battles connected with the D-Day invasions in World War II. It uses an enhanced version of the same &quot;Command &amp; Colors&quot; game system as found in &quot;Battle Cry&quot;.

==Gameplay summary==

Players start the game by choosing a scenario, representing a battle from World War II. Scenarios are available from the manual, the internet, or can be invented by players. The terrain and starting positions are laid out according to the scenario.

The battlefield, on a hexagon-gridded board, is divided into three sections by two red dotted lines, giving each player a left flank, a center and a right flank section.

Troops are commanded by playing a command card, which orders troops to move, battle and/or execute a special command. There are two types of command cards: Section cards and Tactic cards. Section cards are used to order a move and/or battle in a specific section. These cards indicate in which sections of the battlefield units may be given orders, and how many units may be commanded. Tactic cards allow players to make special moves, battle in a specific way or take special actions, as explained on the card.

The object of the game is to be the first to win a set number of Victory Medals, usually 4 to 6, depending on the selected battle scenario&#x27;s victory conditions. A Victory Medal is gained for each enemy unit entirely eliminated from the battlefield. In some scenarios, additional Medals may be gained from the board map itself, for capturing and holding certain terrain hexagons (hexes) or battlefield objectives.

==Scenarios==
There are a dozen scenarios in the base game as well as several more in the various expansions. Most of these scenarios are created from famous battles in World War II. Official scenarios (the ones published in scenario booklets and on the Days of Wonder internet site) have full support from the DoW team and are thoroughly playtested to ensure balance between the two players (e.g. not a total overrun of German troops at the start of the Soviet campaign) and others represent tougher battles like the assault on Omaha Beach, where the Allied player has difficulty in crossing the beach inland.

Another section online is devoted to scenarios the Memoir &#x27;44 owners themselves created. These are unofficial and so not playtested by the DoW team, but mostly by the creators themselves. (In rare cases these scenarios are later adopted officially.) These scenarios allow the Memoir &#x27;44 player to have experiences designed by other players.

==Command cards==
Command Cards are used to order soldiers around the board. Command Cards are divided in two types: Section and Tactic cards. There are a total of 60 Command Cards which is divided into 40 section cards and 20 tactic cards. A Command Card is played first to start each turn, followed by ordering units. After all orders are completed, a player replenishes their hand by drawing a new Command Card from the deck.

===Section cards===
Section cards are cards that specify the number of units ordered in a specific section. These numbers run from 1-3 and All (meaning that all the units in a particular section can be ordered). Examples include &quot;Probe Left Flank&quot; (allowing a player to order 2 units on the left flank) and &quot;Assault Right Flank&quot; (allowing a player to order &quot;all&quot; units on the right flank).

A special section card is Recon-1 (with particular section: left, center or right). A player may only order 1 unit in the section stated on the card but at the end of the turn the usual drawing of one Command card is replaced by a choice of one from two Command cards.

Every turn, a maximum of one card can be played, except for the Ambush Tactic Card, which is played against an action by the other player.

===Tactic cards===
Tactic Cards are different from section cards in that they do not specify exactly a number of orders in a certain section. These tactic cards consist of special actions or enhancements to battling (such as adding an extra die).

Examples include &quot;Armor Assault&quot; (order four tank units, units in Close Assault, next to the enemy unit, may battle with an extra die) and &quot;Medics and Mechanics&quot; (order one unit, roll dice to &#x27;heal/repair&#x27; the unit by adding figures according to number of dice, and let it move and battle).

==Expansions==
Days of Wonder has released several expansions to the game. All these expansions require at least one copy of the original game to be played. The expansions are listed in chronological date of release.

===Terrain Pack===
This expansion pack consists mostly of new terrain, landmarks, and badges. Its main purpose is to allow for a much greater variety in scenario creation. Using its components, players can design a wide variety of new scenarios and also play many other user-developed scenarios from the Memoir 44 website. Examples of tiles include landmarks like a radar station (with optional special rules), roads (which enhance movement), railroads and a train, new bridges and badges (Airborne, engineers).

===Eastern Front===
This expansion pack comes with an additional side, the Soviet Union. The Red Army consists of Infantry figures, T-34 tanks and the ZIS-3 Artillery gun. It contains terrain, mainly winter terrain, badges, a Commissar Chip, and extra rules to play one of the 8 new scenarios included with the game.

===Winter / Desert Board Map===
This is a new board for use with the expansions. One side features a desert map for use with the Terrain Pack and Mediterranean Theatre expansion and the other side features a winter map for use with the Eastern Front expansion or snowy scenarios on the Western Front. Simplified Campaign Rules and Blitz Rules are also added.

===Pacific Theatre===
This expansion features the Japanese army including infantry figures, Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks, and the Type 88 75 mm AA Gun used as artillery piece. The expansion also features new terrain tiles, all in Pacific style, including jungles and rice paddies. Also included are War Ships (destroyer, Aircraft carrier) and the night visibility chart, which influences fighting and range.

===Air Pack===
This expansion pack, released on December 18, 2007, introduces airplanes into the scenarios. It includes a set of 8 painted miniature planes, air rules for scenarios, updated command cards, and updated scenarios.

The 8 painted Aircraft are, for each power respectively:

United States:
* Lockheed P-38 Lightning
* Curtiss P-40 Warhawk
* Vought F4U Corsair

United Kingdom
* Supermarine Spitfire

Soviet Union:
* Yakovlev Yak-1 (also used for the 7 and 9 series)

Germany:
* Messerschmitt Bf 109
* Fieseler Fi 156 Storch

Japan:
* Mitsubishi A6M Zero

As of December 17, 2013 the Air Pack has been discontinued and is now only available as a PDF download on Days of Wonder&#x27;s website.

===Mediterranean Theatre===
This expansion introduces the British army, consisting of infantry, 25 pounder gun-howitzers, and Crusader tanks. It also includes new terrain, obstacles, badges, rules, 8 new scenarios, and a new class of special weapon equipment. 

===Campaign Bag===
An olive drab game bag with several pockets. On the outside are Memoir 44 logos and other artwork. It is large enough to store two copies of the original game and all the current expansions. Comes with an additional two-sided paper breakthrough map. On one side of the new breakthrough map is regular terrain. On the other side is a brand new breakthrough scenario titled Breakthrough to Gembloux.

===New Flight Plan===
An air expansion that streamlines and simplifies the rules of the original Air Pack with brand new rules for air to ground and air to air warfare. Alongside new rules, the expansion also included 16 unpainted airplane miniatures, 30 air combat cards, 8 reference cards for the airplanes, 15 nation markers for the airplanes, 18 machine gun markers, 12 bomb markers, 1 rules booklet and 1 booklet with 21 new scenarios. The expansion was released at the end of May 2019. 

===Battlemap Series===
Days of Wonder also started to create battlemaps themselves. These battlemaps are large battles played in Overlord style (or even bigger, as is the case with Tigers in the Snow). Another feature of the battlemaps is that it includes extra materials, like miniatures or new cards. Battlemaps have included &quot;Hedgerow Hell&quot;, &quot;Tigers in the Snow&quot;, &quot;Sword of Stalingrad&quot;, &quot;Disaster at Dieppe&quot;, &quot;Battles of Khalkin Gol&quot;, and &quot;Through Jungle and Desert&quot;. 

==Campaign Books==
Two campaign books have been published by Days of Wonder.

===Campaign Book Volume 1===
Campaign Book Volume 1 was published in 2009 and contains fifty scenarios and campaign rules in which players can play many of these scenarios together in larger campaigns, some scenarios found in the Campaign Book Volume 1 require the Terrain Pack &amp; Eastern Front. As of December 17, 2013 this volume has been Out Of Print and is now only available as a PDF download.

===Campaign Book Volume 2===
Campaign Book Volume 2 was published in 2011, expanding on the campaign rules found in Campaign Book Volume 1, Campaign Book Volume 2 contains 46 scenarios which are covered in 11 different campaigns. Some scenarios found in the Campaign Book Volume 2 require the Terrain Pack &amp; Pacific &amp; Air Pack.

<text>Herdla is an island in the municipality of Askøy in Vestland county, Norway. The island lies just north of the larger island of Askøy and just west of the island of Holsnøy. The island is surrounded by the Herdlefjorden and Hjeltefjorden.

The island of Herdla was part of the municipality of Herdla until 1 January 1964 when it was merged into Askøy. The island has a nature reserve with 220 registered species of birds. During the Second World War, it was the site of Herdla Airport and some coastal fortifications. Herdla Church is located on the island.

== Air base and coastal fortifications ==

During the Second World War, all of Herdla was in effect a military base for the German Luftwaffe. The flat area &quot;Herdlevalen&quot; was considered a good place for an airport. The air base at Herdla was important to defend the west coast of Norway against Allied attacks. Many fortifications were built to hinder possibly invading forces. All civilians had to leave the island. In 1945, they came back to an island full of military installations.

Herdla was seriously considered as the site for Bergen&#x27;s main airport. After the war the air traffic control for the Bergen area was placed at Herdla. However, in 1955, the airport was finally built at Flesland instead, since that would not require boat to reach it.

After the war some of the military installations were assimilated into the Royal Norwegian Coastal Artillery, which also built a series of new installations on the island. In recent years the fortress had been used for training new recruits for the coastal artillery, but the fortress was permanently closed in 2000 as part of major restructuring of the Norwegian Armed Forces, when the Royal Norwegian Coastal Artillery was decommissioned.

<doc id="1031586" wikidata="Q185603" url="?curid=1031586" title="Waka/Jawaka">
<text>Waka/Jawaka (also known as Waka/Jawaka — Hot Rats) is the fourth solo album, fifteenth album counting the work of his band the Mothers of Invention, by Frank Zappa, released in July 1972. The album is the jazz-influenced precursor to &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; (November 1972), and as the front cover indicates, a sequel of sorts to 1969&#x27;s &quot;Hot Rats&quot;. According to Zappa, the title &quot;is something that showed up on a ouija board at one time.&quot;

==Songs==
&quot;Big Swifty&quot; is a jazz-fusion tune, similar to many of Zappa&#x27;s pieces from the jazz period of his compositional timeline. It features many horns to achieve a thick brassy sound as well as room for improvisation and use of multiple time signatures. The tune initially alternates between and time signatures, soon settling on a swing feel for several extended solos. Known recorded live versions expanded rhythmic diversification to and rubato parts (e.g. live in Texas, 1973).

The track &quot;It Just Might Be a One-Shot Deal&quot; is a strange tale of hallucinations sung by Sal Marquez and Janet Ferguson (the &quot;tough-minded&quot; groupie in &quot;200 Motels&quot;). Sneaky Pete Kleinow&#x27;s pedal steel guitar sets up a dream-like, smooth quality, but with the words &quot;but you should be diggin&#x27; it while it&#x27;s happening cause it just might be a one-shot deal&quot;, though played in real time rather than achieved with a splice, it again sounds as if the music has started to run backwards.

== Critical reception ==
Initial reviews for the album were mixed. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Rob Houghton compared it to &quot;second-rate Miles Davis,&quot; but concluded that &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot; was &quot;one of Zappa’s most enjoyable, less hypertense efforts.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was less charitable: &quot;With Sal Marquez playing &#x27;many trumpets&#x27; all over &#x27;Big Swifty,&#x27; there are times you could drop the needle and think you were listening to recent Miles Davis. That&#x27;s certainly what Zappa&#x27;s been doing. But where Davis is occasionally too loose, Zappa&#x27;s always too tight—he seems to perceive only what is weird and alienating in his influences, never what is humane. Also, Sal Marquez doesn&#x27;t play trumpet(s) as good as Miles.&quot; However, the album&#x27;s reputation has improved over time. In UDiscoverMusic in 2022, Jamie Atkins wrote, &quot;&quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot; stands up on its own as one of Zappa’s most vibrant and enjoyable explorations of jazz-rock.&quot;

==Reissues==
The album was reissued in a digitally remastered version on CD by Rykodisc in 1988 (with much digital reverb added and missing the original back cover artwork) and in 1995 (restoring the rear cover, but with identical sound). In 2012, Universal Music released a CD containing a remastered version of the original vinyl mix.

On December 16, 2022, Universal Music released Dolby Atmos &amp; Dolby TrueHD mix of this album along with &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; as part of a 4CD+1Blu-Ray set named &quot;Waka/Wazoo&quot;, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the albums. The album was also released in black and colored vinyl to celebrate the 50th Anniversary.

<doc id="1031588" wikidata="Q1428124" url="?curid=1031588" title="Flesh and Blood (1985 film)">
<text>Flesh and Blood is a 1985 romantic historical adventure film directed by Paul Verhoeven, and starring Rutger Hauer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tom Burlinson, Susan Tyrrell, Ronald Lacey, Bruno Kirby and Jack Thompson. The script was written by Verhoeven and Gerard Soeteman. The story is set in 1501 in early modern Italy, and follows two warring groups of mercenaries and their longstanding quarrel.

The script is partly based on unused material for the Dutch television series &quot;Floris&quot;, which was the debut for Verhoeven, Soeteman and Hauer. The film, originally titled &quot;God&#x27;s Own Butchers&quot;, was also known as The Rose and the Sword on early VHS releases. It was Verhoeven&#x27;s first English-language film.

Upon its release in August 1985, &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; was a box office bomb, earning only 100,000 on a 6.5 million production budget. The film has since garnered a small cult following.

== Plot ==
In 1501, a city in Italy was taken by a coup d&#x27;état while its rightful ruler, Arnolfini, was away. Arnolfini promises some mercenaries 24 hours of looting if they succeed in retaking the city, and they do so, raping and killing those who stand in their way. In their revelry, Arnolfini decides that he wants the mercenaries gone.

Hawkwood, the commander of the troops, cares for a young nun he mistakenly attacked during the siege. Arnolfini promises to get medical attention for her, while Hawkwood leads Arnolfini&#x27;s cavalry, betraying his former lieutenant, Martin. The cavalry ejects the mercenaries from the city without their loot. Martin&#x27;s son is later stillborn. Burying the infant unearths a wooden statue of Saint Martin of Tours—a saint with a sword. The mercenaries&#x27; chaplain views this as a sign from God to follow Martin as their new leader.
Arnolfini&#x27;s son Steven is betrothed to Agnes. They meet for the first time and eat from a mandrake to magically fall in love, and later the entourage is attacked and robbed by Martin&#x27;s band. Arnolfini is seriously injured; Kathleen, Agnes&#x27; lady-in-waiting, is killed; and Agnes is hauled away, concealed among her valuable dowry. Martin discovers Agnes that evening as they strip the caravan of valuables. The men desire to rape her but Martin decides to take her himself. He rapes Agnes in front of the caravan while she at first taunts him, and then begs Martin&#x27;s protection when he is finished. Martin prevents the rest of the men from raping her.

The mercenaries come upon a castle where, unknown to them, the inhabitants are infected with the plague. They capture the castle with the help of Agnes. She induces Martin to fall in love with her and works on the other mercenaries to accept her. She appears to have given up on her former life. Determined to rescue her, Steven turns to Hawkwood. Hawkwood only wants to live a quiet life, married to the former nun. Steven, becoming as ruthless as his father, seizes her to force Hawkwood to help his pursuit of Martin.

Steven&#x27;s party locates Martin and the mercenaries. They do not have sufficient force to take the castle and lay siege to it. In the castle, Martin asks Agnes where her true loyalty lies; she is noncommittal, hinting that the winner takes all. Outside, the plague spreads among Steven&#x27;s forces and infects Hawkwood. Steven builds a siege tower to storm the castle, and Martin destroys it with something Steven had tried earlier: gunpowder. Steven&#x27;s soldiers are killed as Steven scales the tower&#x27;s ladders, and falls into the castle grounds.

The mercenaries capture Steven and shackle him in the courtyard; Agnes joins in his abuse. Using a new medical technique Steven learned (cutting the buboes on the infected body), Hawkwood cures his plague. He cannot continue the siege alone but, before leaving for additional troops, he and the physician, Father George, catapult pieces of an infected dog into the castle. One chunk lands near the chained Steven; he initially warns Martin of the danger of the dog, but flings it into the castle&#x27;s water well after seeing Agnes acquiesce to Martin&#x27;s sexual demands. Steven says that she can decide whether to tell the mercenaries.

The mercenaries wish to leave the castle, fearing the plague, but Martin persuades them to stay. At the next meal, Agnes watches as they drink infected water. As Martin begins to drink, she slaps the cup from his hand, just as the mercenaries begin to show signs of the plague. The party blame Martin, and hurl him into the well. Agnes then joins in the abuse of Martin.

After the throng departs, Steven needs Martin&#x27;s key to escape from the shackles, and Martin needs Steven to get out of the well. The two cooperate, but upon seeing that Hawkwood and Arnolfini recovered from their wounds and returned with an army, Martin flees to the belfry. Using a lightning storm to strike the chain, Steven frees himself and, as the battle rages, races to find Agnes. During the fighting, the belfry catches fire. All the mercenaries, save Martin, Polly, Anna, and Little John, end up dead.

Martin confronts Agnes, who claims that she loves him. He prepares to murder her rather than allow her to return to Steven. As Martin is strangling Agnes, Steven attacks. Martin overpowers Steven and almost drowns him, but Agnes strikes Martin on the head, and she and Steven flee the blazing castle and reunite with Hawkwood. As Agnes and Steven embrace, Agnes sees Martin over Steven&#x27;s shoulder, escaping from the castle, a sack of loot on his shoulder. She says nothing.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
After tiring of attempting to have his controversial Dutch films subsidized by the government, Verhoeven looked elsewhere for funding for &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, eventually securing most of the budget from Hollywood studio Orion Pictures. However, Orion soon requested changes, feeling that the film needed a love interest; thus, instead of focusing on the relationship between Hawkwood and Martin, Agnes was introduced and attention turned to her romantic entanglement with both Martin and Steven. Verhoeven later said: &quot;The triangular relationship [of] Martin–Agnes–Steven is now the main story line, but in retrospect I think we should have stuck with Hawkwood and Martin. The failure of &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; was a lesson for me: never again compromise on the main story line of a script.&quot;
In addition to a cast featuring American, Australian, British, Spanish and Dutch actors, attempting to handle an international co-production funded by multiple sources who all wanted to take the film in different directions overwhelmed Verhoeven, who had also not storyboarded the film in a bid to achieve a &quot;looser visual approach&quot;. There were a number of delays and disagreements because of the subsequent improvisational style of filming; many members of the cast and crew also arrived and left when they pleased to party on a local beach. One of the most notable disagreements was between Verhoeven and Hauer, who wanted to cultivate a reputation for playing heroic characters rather than villains, as he did in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). This was at odds with Verhoeven&#x27;s intent to portray the moral ambiguity of its characters and the Middle Ages as a &quot;stinking time in which to live&quot; to distance it from typical medieval fantasy depictions of the period. This caused a bitter rift to develop between the two, who did not work together again.

Some of the film was censored, including the rape sequence. This upset Jennifer Jason Leigh, who was opposed to censorship. &quot;It&#x27;s a hard scene to watch,&quot; she said. &quot;Brutal and ugly as rape is, I know it&#x27;s going to upset a lot of people. But the film is extraordinary. Paul Verhoeven is so gifted.&quot;

&quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; was shot in Spain, in Belmonte (Cuenca), Cáceres and Ávila.

&quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;″s musical score was composed by Basil Poledouris, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra. La-La Land Records released an extended CD of the score in 2013 with almost twice as much music as the original 1985 LP/CD release by Varèse Sarabande.

==Release==
Though the film received worldwide release in the summer of 1985, in the United States, Orion Pictures gave the film a limited theatrical release on August 16, 1985, in Los Angeles and New York City. Thus, the film did not gross a large amount in the country, and by most accounts, performed poorly. By 1986, the film was showing in the U.S. on HBO, a business partner of Orion Pictures.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Verhoeven has hypothesized on the reasons for the film&#x27;s failure at the American box office in the years since its release, including statements that it was &quot;too cynical and downbeat&quot; to be a hit. Professor of film and literature at California Polytechnic State University Douglas Keesey suggested that the film had &quot;no hero to root for and no happy fantasy element to lighten its unpleasantly realistic depiction of the Middle Ages&quot;.

The film&#x27;s financial failure caused Verhoeven to move to the United States in September 1985 in order to better understand American culture and what films would be suited to its audience. In addition to this, his previous films, notably &quot;Spetters&quot; (1980), had been protested by members of the Dutch public and it had become difficult to gain financing to shoot productions in his home country.

===Critical response===

Although unsuccessful at the box office upon release, the film has become a critical and cult favorite. It maintains an 86% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.1/10.

Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote in his review: &quot;From the start of his career, Dutch director Paul Verhoeven has mostly focused on making violent, sexy genre pieces—often punishing, often absurd, and always placed in the context of a moralistic pessimism. Verhoeven’s 1985 English-language film debut &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; wallows in mud and misery, with Rutger Hauer playing an early-16th-century mercenary who leads a troupe of undesirables in a revolt against a deadbeat lord, and Jennifer Jason Leigh playing a virginal lady who’s kidnapped by the rebels and becomes Hauer’s (mostly) willing mate.&quot;

== Cultural impact ==
The movie inspired &quot;Berserk&quot; creator Kentaro Miura, who said in a 2003 interview when he won the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize&#x27;s Award for Excellence (2002) that he based the design of &quot;Berserk&quot; protagonist Guts on the character Martin as portrayed by actor Rutger Hauer.

<text>The Lovers of Zion, also Hovevei Zion () or Hibbat Zion (, ), were a variety of proto-Zionist organizations founded in 1881 in response to the anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire and were officially constituted as a group at a conference led by Leon Pinsker in 1884.

The organizations are now considered the forerunners and foundation-builders of modern Zionism. Many of the first groups were established in Eastern European countries in the early 1880s with the aim to promote Jewish immigration to Palestine, and advance Jewish settlement there, particularly agricultural. Most of them stayed away from politics.

==History==


19th century Palestine was inhabited by Muslims, Armenians, Christians, and Jews. As early as 1840 Moses Montefiore advocated for the Jews in the Ottoman Empire, which controlled the areas of Palestine, meeting with British consul Lord Palmerston to get Mehemet Ali and the Sultan to protect the Jews of Palestine from conflicts with the Ottomans.

In 1850, according to the Ottoman census provincial yearbook, Palestine had 63,659 recorded households. Roughly 85% were Muslim, 11% were Christian and 4% Jewish. The Jewish population was recorded at about 14,730, and increased to 24,000 by 1882.

In 1854, Judah Touro bequeathed money to fund Jewish residential settlement in Palestine. Sir Moses Montefiore was appointed executor of his will, and used the funds for a variety of projects, including building the first Jewish residential settlement and almshouse outside of the old walled city of Jerusalem in 1860, which is known today as Mishkenot Sha&#x27;ananim quarter. Laurence Oliphant failed in a like attempt to bring to Palestine the Jewish proletariat of Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and the Turkish Empire (1879 and 1882).

In the Russian Empire, waves of pogroms of 1881–1884 (some allegedly state-sponsored), as well as the anti-Semitic May Laws of 1882 introduced by Tsar Alexander III of Russia, deeply affected Jewish communities. More than 2 million Jews fled Russia between 1880 and 1920. The vast majority of them emigrated to the United States, but some decided to form an &quot;aliyah&quot; to Ottoman-ruled Palestine.

In 1882, a group of ten &quot;Hovevei Zion&quot; enthusiasts from Kharkiv, headed by Zalman David Levontin and including noted philanthropists Isaac Leib Goldberg and Reuven Yudalevich, founded Rishon LeZion, the first Zionist settlement founded in the Land of Israel by the New Yishuv. This was done despite obstacles posed by the Turkish government, which hindered the purchase of land. Later, Bilu pioneers strengthened the settlement and enlarged it. For many years, textbooks gave Bilu the credit for the establishment of Rishon LeZion, but in the last decades—after a campaign by the veterans of Rishon and their descendants—&quot;Hovevei Zion&quot; were given the credit as the founders of the city.

The Hovevei Zion tract &quot;Aruchas bas-ami&quot; was authored by Isaac Rülf in 1883, and in 1884, 34 delegates met in Kattowitz, Germany (today Katowice, Poland). Rabbi Samuel Mohilever was elected the president and Leon Pinsker the chairman of the organization they named &quot;Hovevei Zion&quot;. Pinsker was aided by Shaul Pinchas Rabbinowicz. The group tried to secure financial help from Baron Edmond James de Rothschild and other philanthropists to aid Jewish settlements in Palestine and to organize educational courses. In June 1887, another conference was held in Druskininkai.

The Warsaw chapter was founded by L. L. Zamenhof, who was working on the first grammar textbook of Yiddish ever written, published under the pseudonym &quot;Dr. X&quot; only in 1909, in &quot;Lebn un visnshaft&quot;, in the article &quot;Vegn a yidisher gramatik un reform in der yidisher shprakh&quot;.

In order to attain legal recognition by the authorities, the Russian branch of &quot;Hovevei Zion&quot; had to meet a demand to be registered as a charity. Early in 1890 its establishment was approved by the Russian government as &quot;The Society for the Support of Jewish Farmers and Artisans in Syria and Eretz Israel,&quot; which came to be known as The Odessa Committee. It was dedicated to the practical aspects in establishing agricultural settlements and its projects in 1890–1891 included help in the founding of Rehovot and Hadera and rehabilitation of Mishmar HaYarden.

One of the major donors was the famous tea merchant, Kalonimus Wolf Wissotzky, who founded the largest tea company in Russia, Wissotzky Tea. Wissotzky financed agricultural colonies in Palestine and visited the country in 1884–1885. He later published a book about his visit.

In 1897, before the First Zionist Congress, the Odessa Committee counted over 4,000 members. Once the Congress established the Zionist Organization, most of the &quot;Hovevei Zion&quot; societies joined it.

<doc id="1031601" wikidata="Q17066253" url="?curid=1031601" title="Playoff Bowl">
<text>The Playoff Bowl (officially known as the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl) was a post-season game for third place in the National Football League (NFL), played ten times following the through seasons, all at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. It was originally known as the Runner-Up Bowl.

The official title of Bert Bell Benefit Bowl came from the former NFL commissioner, Bert Bell. Bell, who co-founded the Eagles and co-owned the Steelers, was commissioner of the NFL from until his death during an NFL game in October . The game raised money for the players&#x27; pension fund, and reportedly raised a million dollars over the decade of the 1960s.

==Location==
All ten games in the Playoff Bowl series were contested at the Orange Bowl in Miami. The games were played in January, the week following the NFL championship game (and the collegiate Orange Bowl game on New Year&#x27;s Day), except for the final year, when it was played the day before the NFL title game. The NFL&#x27;s Pro Bowl (all-star game) was played the week after the Playoff Bowl.

==History==
After the season, NFL owners faced competition from the newly-formed American Football League and wanted a vehicle through which to showcase more of its supposedly superior NFL professional football product on television, then carried through the CBS Television Network. At the time, unlike the AFL, which had a contract with the ABC Television Network for their nationally televised games, often double-headers, few NFL games were televised nationally during the season and there was only one scheduled post-season game, the NFL Championship Game. The Playoff Bowl was devised to match the second-place teams from the NFL&#x27;s two conferences (Eastern and Western). This doubled from two to four the number of top NFL teams appearing in post-season play on national television. 

The 1966 season required another game following the American Football League Championship Game and the NFL Championship Game, the first of four AFL–NFL World Championship Games between the champions of the two major Professional Football leagues for the undisputed championship. The establishment of the AFL–NFL World Championship Game (the Super Bowl name was not made official until Super Bowl III) was the first phase of the AFL–NFL merger of June 1966. This new mega-game between the rival leagues was played in mid-January at a warm weather location, two weeks after the championship games for each league. The NFL&#x27;s Playoff Bowl was played during the idle week, and because of AFL&#x27;s equally major league status, interest in the game was waning. In addition, the arrival of the Miami Dolphins in 1966 as an expansion franchise in the AFL reduced local interest in the game.

In the season, the NFL expanded to 16 teams and four scheduled post-season contests. The NFL sub-divided its two conferences (now eight teams each) into two divisions of four teams each: The Capitol and Century divisions in the Eastern conference, and the Central and Coastal divisions in the Western conference. The four division winners advanced to the post-season, competing for their conference titles in the first round of the NFL playoffs. The winners (conference champions) advanced to the NFL championship game, the losers (conference runners-up) appeared in the Playoff Bowl to vie for third place. For the three seasons (–69) preceding the merger with the AFL, the loser of the NFL&#x27;s third place game ended up with a peculiar record of 0-2 for that post-season. In its final season in 1969, the AFL also expanded to a four-team post-season, adding two more playoff games.

The highest attendance was over 65,500 in January 1966 for the Baltimore Colts&#x27; rout of the Dallas Cowboys; the season was the last one prior to the Dolphins starting play, the AFL–NFL merger agreement, and the creation of the Super Bowl. In January 1968 and 1969, the Super Bowl was played in the Orange Bowl the following week, which further contributed to the declining attendance for the NFL&#x27;s consolation game.

===The end of the Playoff Bowl===
When the merger was completed for the season, there was discussion about continuing the Playoff Bowl, with the losers of the AFC and NFC Championship Games playing each other during the idle week before the Super Bowl. There were now seven post-season games in the NFL (three for each conference, plus the Super Bowl), and the Pro Bowl all-star game. A &quot;losers&#x27; game&quot; was not necessarily attractive for the league, and the Playoff Bowl came to an end.

===Official status===
The ten Playoff Bowls were official third place playoff games at the time they were played; today, the NFL consider the games as exhibitions.

===Criticism===
Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi detested the Playoff Bowl, coaching in the games following the 1963 and 1964 seasons, after winning NFL titles in 1961 and 1962. To his players, he called it &quot;the &#x27;Shit Bowl&#x27;, ...a losers&#x27; bowl for losers.&quot; This lack of motivation may explain his Packers&#x27; rare postseason defeat in the 1964 game (January 1965) to the St. Louis Cardinals. After that loss, he fumed about &quot;a hinky-dink football game, held in a hinky-dink town, played by hinky-dink players. That&#x27;s all second place is – hinky dink.&quot;

Using the Playoff Bowl (and loss) as motivation in 1965, the Packers won the first of three consecutive NFL championships from 1965 to 1967. The Packers remain the sole NFL team to win three consecutive titles in the post-season era, which began in . During this successful run, the Packers also won the first two Super Bowls in convincing fashion. Lombardi&#x27;s final game (and victory) as head coach of the Packers was Super Bowl II, played in the Orange Bowl in January 1968.

All-Pro defensive tackle Roger Brown appeared in five Playoff Bowls, the most by any player, and was on the winning side each time (Detroit Lions in 1960, 1961, 1962; Los Angeles Rams in 1967, 1969). He said playing in those seemingly meaningless contests was like having &quot;the worst inferiority complex.&quot; He added, &quot;I was in five of them, and to have played in it five in the ten years it was in existence is pitiful.&quot;

The Lions also hold the dubious distinction of having the most victories in the Playoff Bowl, three, along with tying for the best winning percentage, 1.000.

==Players&#x27; shares==
In its second year, the players on the winning team received $600 each (), the losers $400 (); and the fifth year game paid $800 () and $600 (). In its final years, the winners received $1,200 each (), and the losers $500 ().

==Legacy==
The Playoff Bowl was typically held in the Orange Bowl stadium in Miami. It led to Super Bowl II being held in Miami, the first of 11 Super Bowls held in Miami area, and is credited by NFL Films for the creation of the expansion Miami Dolphins. 

The 1966 season Playoff Bowl game was used by NFL Films to put a microphone on Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; head coach Joe Kuharich, which is credited by the league as part of the signature of NFL Films&#x27; videos featuring microphones on coaches and players.

That same Eagles-Colts Playoff Bowl marked the debut of the &quot;slingshot&quot; or &quot;tuning fork&quot; goalpost, with one curved support, in American football. This style of goalpost was first used by the Canadian Football League for the 54th Grey Cup the previous November. The NFL adopted the single-support post for the 1967 season, and it continues to be used by the NFL and CFL, as well as most colleges and many high schools in both countries. 

One vestige of the Playoff Bowl remained through the 2008 season in that the head coaches of the losing teams from the conference championship games were the head coaches of their conferences&#x27; Pro Bowl teams. From 1980 to 2009, this all-star game was played at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu the Sunday following the Super Bowl. However, in 2010, the Pro Bowl moved to Miami Gardens, Florida, and was played the week before Super Bowl XLIV (as the Playoff Bowl was in the Super Bowl era).

For the 2009 season, a new rule for determining the Pro Bowl coaches resulted in the disappearance of one Playoff Bowl legacy. The coaching staffs for the 2010 Pro Bowl did not come from the losers of the conference championship games, but instead from the teams with the best regular-season records among those that lost in the divisional round of the playoffs in each conference.

==Playoff Bowl results==
All ten games were played at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. Most were played the week following the NFL Championship game, with two exceptions: the first was played two weeks after and the last the day before. The first two games and the last one were played on Saturday, with the rest being played on Sunday. The Western Conference team won eight of the ten games.

<text>Stéphanie Louise Adrienne de Beauharnais (28 August 1789 – 29 January 1860) was a French princess and the Grand Duchess consort of Baden by marriage to Karl, Grand Duke of Baden.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Versailles at the beginning of the French Revolution, Stéphanie was the daughter of Claude de Beauharnais, 2nd Count des Roches-Baritaud (1756–1819). In 1783 the 2nd Count married Claudine Françoise de Lezay (1767–1791). The marriage resulted in the birth of first her older brother Alberic de Beauharnais (1786–1791) and then Stephanie herself. Her father remarried in 1799 to Suzanne Fortin-Duplessis (1775–1850). 

On 13 December 1779 Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais, first cousin of her father, married Joséphine Tascher de la Pagerie. On 23 July 1794, Alexandre was guillotined. Joséphine had affairs with several influential figures of the French Directory, including Paul François Jean Nicolas Barras. The latter would introduce her to his recent favorite Napoléon Bonaparte. Napoléon soon started courting her. On 9 March 1796 they were married.

General Napoléon Bonaparte was now stepfather to Eugène de Beauharnais and Hortense de Beauharnais, second cousins of Stephanie. As his prominence and wealth continued to rise, Napoléon found himself being &quot;de facto&quot; patron to both the Bonaparte and the de Beauharnais families. Stephanie would soon see her patron rise to become First Consul of France. 
===Princess===
Her &quot;uncle&quot; crowned himself Emperor of the French on 2 December 1804. As a prominent member of the new Imperial Family, Stephanie held residence in the Tuileries Palace. Her new status allowed her to live a rather luxurious life. 

This was a consequence of Napoleon&#x27;s effort to secure an alliance with the Prince-elector of Baden. The alliance was to be secured through a marriage between the descendants of the two sovereigns, connecting the two dynasties. The Prince-Elector was to be represented by his grandson. Napoleon on the other hand lacked legitimate descendants of his own. He adopted Stephanie and named her &quot;Princesse Française&quot; (French Princess) with the style of Imperial Highness. 

===Grand Duchess of Baden===
The marriage of Stephanie and Karl (Charles), took place in Paris on 8 April 1806. On 25 July 1806 her new grandfather-in-law was named Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden.

By most accounts the arranged marriage was not particularly successful. Her husband was determined to continue living as a bachelor. He set residence in Karlsruhe. She was allowed to settle separately in Mannheim. Even the official complaints by the Emperor did not resolve this situation. The Grand Duke offered Schwetzingen to be their common summer residence. But only Stephanie accepted the offer. The situation changed somewhat when it became evident that the aging Grand Duke would not live much longer. The couple reconciled in an effort to produce heirs for the throne when her spouse succeeded to the throne in 1811.

The Grand Duke died on 8 December 1818. Stephanie remained a widow for the rest of her long life. She was reportedly a devoted mother to her three daughters. Her residence in Mannheim became a popular Salon for artists and intellectuals. Stephanie died in Nice, France at the age of 71, in 1860, 41 years after her husband.

==Children==
On 10 June 1811, Stephanie&#x27;s husband, Karl, succeeded his grandfather as Grand Duke of Baden. He and Grand Duchess Stephanie would have five children:
*Princess Luise Amelie Stephanie of Baden (5 June 1811 – 19 July 1854). She was married on 30 November 1830 to Gustav, Prince of Vasa.
* Unnamed son (29 September 1812 – 16 October 1812).
* Princess Josephine Friederike Luise of Baden (21 October 1813 – 19 June 1900). She was married on 21 October 1834 to Karl Anton, Fürst of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.
* Prince Alexander of Baden (1–8 May 1816).
* Princess Marie Amelie Elisabeth Karoline of Baden (11 October 1817 – 8 October 1888). She was married on 23 February 1843 to William Alexander Anthony Archibald Douglas-Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton.

<text>Temporary regulations regarding the Jews (also known as May Laws) were residency and business restrictions on Jews in the Russian Empire, proposed by minister Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev and enacted by Tsar Alexander III on 15 May (3 May O.S.), 1882. Originally, intended only as temporary measures, they remained in effect for more than thirty years.

==Overview==
=== Regulations ===
They read as follows:
# &quot;As a temporary measure, and until a general revision is made of their legal status, it is decreed that the Jews be forbidden to settle anew outside of towns and boroughs, exceptions being admitted only in the case of existing Jewish agricultural colonies.&quot;
# &quot;Temporarily forbidden are the issuing of mortgages and other deeds to Jews, as well as the registration of Jews as lessees of real property situated outside of towns and boroughs; and also the issuing to Jews of powers of attorney to manage and dispose of such real property.&quot;
# &quot;Jews are forbidden to transact business on Sundays and on principal Christian holy days; the existing regulations concerning closing of places of business belonging to Christians on such days should apply to Jews also.&quot;
# &quot;The measures laid down in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 shall apply only to governments within the Pale of Jewish Settlement.&quot;

=== Subsequent legislation ===
In subsequent years, other discriminatory laws were enacted. Quotas were enacted, limiting the number of Jews admitted to high schools and universities and their overall population percentage.

This legislation was repeatedly revised. In 1887, these administrative quotas were tightened down to 10% within the Pale (still double that of Jewish percentage), 5% outside the Pale, except Moscow and St. Petersburg, which were held at 3%. Many towns in the Pale with a significant Jewish population resulted in half-empty schools and many potential students forbidden to enroll. Many Jewish students were unable to complete their education on the soil of their birth.

The proportion of Jewish doctors working in the army was not allowed to exceed 5%. In contrast, any Jewish lawyer who wished to become a barrister needed the express consent of the Minister of Justice.

At the end of the reign, the right of Jews to sell alcohol was revoked.

In the spring of 1891, most Jews were deported from Moscow (except a few deemed &quot;useful&quot;) and a newly built synagogue was closed by the city&#x27;s authorities, headed by governor-general Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, the Tsar&#x27;s brother. About 20,000 were expelled, causing international condemnations.

In his 9 December 1891 speech to the United States Congress, President Benjamin Harrison said: 

&quot;This government had found occasion to express in a friendly spirit but with much earnestness, to the government of the Tsar, its serious concern because of harsh measures being enforced against the Hebrews.&quot;
In 1892, new measures banned Jewish participation in local elections despite their large numbers in many towns of the Pale. &quot;The &quot;Town Regulations&quot; (&quot;Городовое положение&quot;) of 1892 prohibited Jews from the right to elect or be elected to town Dumas... That way, reverse proportional representation was achieved: the majority of town&#x27;s taxpayers had to be subjugated to minority governing the town against Jewish interests.&quot;

The next year, the &quot;Law Concerning the Names&quot; (&quot;Об именах&quot;) imposed criminal punishment on those Jews who tried to &quot;adopt Christian names&quot; and dictated that Jews must use their birth names (&quot;какими они означены в метрических книгах&quot;) in business, writings, advertisements, nametags, etc.

Those laws remained in effect until 1917 and, together with the steady anti-Jewish riots known as pogroms, provided the impetus for mass emigration from Russia. In the period from 1881 to 1920, over two million Jews left the Russian Empire. Most Russian Jewish emigrants settled in the United States or Argentina, though some immigrated to Palestine, then a province of the Ottoman Empire.

<doc id="1031605" wikidata="Q629444" url="?curid=1031605" title="Dyskinesia">
<text>Dyskinesia refers to a category of movement disorders that are characterized by involuntary muscle movements, including movements similar to tics or chorea and diminished voluntary movements. Dyskinesia can be anything from a slight tremor of the hands to an uncontrollable movement of the upper body or lower extremities. Discoordination can also occur internally especially with the respiratory muscles and it often goes unrecognized. Dyskinesia is a symptom of several medical disorders that are distinguished by their underlying causes.

==Types==
===Medication-induced dyskinesias===
Acute dystonia is a sustained muscle contraction that sometimes appears soon after administration of antipsychotic medications. Any muscle in the body may be affected, including the jaw, tongue, throat, arms, or legs. When the throat muscles are involved, this type of dystonia is called an acute laryngospasm and is a medical emergency because it can impair breathing. Older antipsychotics such as haloperidol or fluphenazine are more likely to cause acute dystonia than newer agents. Giving high doses of antipsychotics by injection also increases the risk of developing acute dystonia.

Methamphetamine, other amphetamines and dopaminergic stimulants including cocaine and pemoline can produce choreoathetoid dyskinesias; the prevalence, time-frame and prognosis are not well established. Amphetamines also cause a dramatic increase in choreoathetoid symptoms in patients with underlying chorea such as Sydenham&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s, and lupus. Long-term use of amphetamines may increase the risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD): in one retrospective study with over 40,000 participants it was concluded that amphetamine abusers generally had a 200% higher chance of developing PD versus those with no history of abuse; the risk was much higher in women, almost 400%. There remains some controversy as of 2017.

Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is evident in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease who have been on levodopa () for prolonged periods of time. LID commonly first appears in the foot, on the most affected side of the body. There are three main types that can be classified on the basis of their course and clinical presentation following an oral dose of :
* Off-period dystonia – correlated to the akinesia that occurs before the full effect of sets in, when the plasma levels of are low. In general, it occurs as painful spasms in the foot. Patients respond to therapy.
* Diphasic dyskinesia – occurs when plasma levels are rising or falling. This form occurs primarily in the lower limbs (though they can happen elsewhere) and is usually dystonic (characterized by apparent rigidity within muscles or groups thereof) or (characterized by involuntary movement of muscles) and will not respond to dosage reductions.
* Peak-dose dyskinesia – the most common form of levodopa-induced dyskinesia; it correlates with the plateau plasma level. This type usually involves the upper limbs more (but could also affect the head, trunk and respiratory muscles), is choreic (of chorea), and less disabling. Patients will respond to reduction but may be accompanied by deterioration of parkinsonism. Peak-dose -induced dyskinesia has been suggested to be associated with cortical dysregulation of dopamine signaling.

===Chronic or tardive===
Late-onset dyskinesia, also known as tardive dyskinesia, occurs after long-term treatment with an antipsychotic drug such as haloperidol (Haldol) or amoxapine (Asendin). The symptoms include tremors and writhing movements of the body and limbs, and abnormal movements in the face, mouth, and tongue including involuntary lip smacking, repetitive pouting of the lips, and tongue protrusions.

Rabbit syndrome is another type of chronic dyskinesia, while orofacial dyskinesia may be related to persistent replication of herpes simplex virus type 1.

===Non-motor===
Two other types, primary ciliary dyskinesia and biliary dyskinesia, are caused by specific kinds of ineffective movement of the body, and are not movement disorders.

==Treatment==
Antidyskinetic drugs can be used to treat dyskinesia. Certain anticonvulsants can be used as antidyskinetic agents, among drugs acting at other targets. Amantadine is approved for treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Dopamine-depleting agents like tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine are used to treat tardive dyskinesia.

<doc id="1031606" wikidata="Q746420" url="?curid=1031606" title="Samuel Sebastian Wesley">
<text>Samuel Sebastian Wesley (14 August 1810 – 19 April 1876) was an English organist and composer. Wesley married Mary Anne Merewether and had 6 children. He is often referred to as S.S. Wesley to avoid confusion with his father Samuel Wesley.

==Biography==
Born in London, he was the eldest child in the composer Samuel Wesley&#x27;s second family, which he formed with Sarah Suter having separated from his wife Charlotte. Samuel Sebastian was the grandson of Charles Wesley. His middle name derived from his father&#x27;s lifelong admiration for the music of Bach.
After singing in the choir of the Chapel Royal as a boy, Samuel Sebastian embarked on a career as a musician, and was appointed organist at Hereford Cathedral in 1832. While there he married the sister of the Dean, John Merewether. S.S. Wesley was, like his father Samuel Wesley, a Freemason. He was initiated in Palladian Lodge No.120 in Hereford on 17 September 1833. He moved to Exeter Cathedral three years later, and joined St George&#x27;s Lodge No.129 Exeter on 10 December 1835. He subsequently held appointments at Leeds Parish Church (now Leeds Minster) (from 1842), Winchester Cathedral (from 1849), Winchester College and Gloucester Cathedral (1865–1876). In 1839 he received both his Bachelor of Music degree and a Doctor of Music degree from Oxford. He became a Professor of Organ at the Royal Academy of Music in 1850. He died at his home in Gloucester on 19 April 1876 aged 65. He is buried next to his daughter in St Bartholomew&#x27;s Cemetery in Exeter by the old City Wall. There are memorial tablets to him in Exeter Cathedral and Winchester Cathedral, and his memorial at Gloucester Cathedral is in stained glass.

Famous in his lifetime as one of his country&#x27;s leading organists and choirmasters, he composed almost exclusively for the Church of England, which continues to cherish his memory. His better-known anthems include &quot;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace&quot; and &quot;Wash me throughly&quot;. He also wrote several rather late examples of verse anthems, which contrast unison and contrapuntal sections with smaller, more intimate passages for solo voice or voices. &quot;Blessed be the God and Father&quot;, &quot;The Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Ascribe unto the Lord&quot; are of considerable length, as is his Service in E.

The popular short anthem &quot;Lead me, Lord&quot; is an extract from &quot;Praise the Lord, O my soul&quot;. Several of his pieces for solo organ have enduring value and continue to be played in recitals now and then.

Of his hymn tunes the best-known are &quot;Aurelia&quot; and &quot;Hereford.&quot; &quot;Aurelia&quot; has been widely adopted in the United States, and is regularly heard there. Usually now sung to the words &quot;The Church&#x27;s One Foundation&quot;, Wesley composed the tune for the hymn &quot;Jerusalem the Golden&quot;, hence the name &quot;Aurelia&quot;.

One notable feature of his career is his aversion to equal temperament, an aversion which he kept for decades after this tuning method had been accepted on the Continent and even in most of England. Such distaste did not stop him from substantial use of chromaticism in several of his published compositions.

While at Winchester Cathedral Wesley was largely responsible for the cathedral&#x27;s acquisition in 1854 of the Father Willis organ which had been exhibited at The Great Exhibition, 1851. The success of the exhibition organ led directly to the award of the contract to Willis for a 100-stop organ for St George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool, built in 1855. Wesley was the consultant for this major and important project, but the organ was, arguably, impaired for some years by Wesley&#x27;s insistence that it be tuned to unequal temperament.

Wesley, with Father Willis, can be credited with the invention of the concave and radiating organ pedalboard, but demurred when Willis proposed that it should be known as the &quot;Wesley-Willis&quot; pedalboard. However, their joint conception has been largely adopted as an international standard for organs throughout the English-speaking world and those exported elsewhere.

<doc id="1031607" wikidata="Q7582259" url="?curid=1031607" title="Squidgygate">
<text>Squidgygate or Dianagate refers to the controversy over pre-1990 telephone conversations between Diana, Princess of Wales, and her lover, James Gilbey (heir to Gilbey&#x27;s Gin), which were published by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. 

In 1992, &quot;The Sun&quot; publicly revealed the recording&#x27;s existence in an article titled &quot;Squidgygate&quot; (the &quot;&quot; suffix being a reference for a scandal). During the calls, Gilbey affectionately called Diana by the names &quot;Squidgy&quot; and &quot;Squidge&quot;. In the conversation, the Princess of Wales likens her situation to that of a character in the popular British soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and expresses concern that she might be pregnant and there is discussion of abortion. The publication of the tapes was a highpoint of the media attention which surrounded Diana&#x27;s serial adultery leading to the marriage, separation, and eventual divorce of The Prince and Princess of Wales.

==Recording and publication==
The tape was published after it was allegedly accidentally recorded by a retired bank manager who was a radio enthusiast.

===First eavesdropper: Cyril Reenan===
In January 1990, two reporters from &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper met Cyril Reenan in the parking bay of Didcot railway station, six miles from his home in Abingdon. Reenan, a 70-year-old retired manager for the Trustee Savings Bank, regularly listened in on non-commercial radio frequencies for amusement with his wife. Reenan played them excerpts from a tape without having previously told them what he had recorded.

Two days later the journalists were shown round Mr Reenan&#x27;s home-made eavesdropping studio, in which &quot;Above the scanners was a 1960s-style tape recorder with a microphone dangling down above the scanning equipment so that the couple could tape &#x27;interesting&#x27; conversations&quot;.

Reenan was quoted as saying he was &quot;so nervous I just want you [the reporters] to take the tape away.&quot; He added, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it once I&#x27;d got it. I was stuck with it, and I was frightened of it,&quot; he was quoted as saying, claiming that if the paper had told him that &quot;the tape was &#x27;dangerous&#x27;, I would have burned it or scrubbed it out.&quot;

Reenan claimed that he had been so worried by the evident security breach that he had first thought of attempting to gain an audience with Diana: &quot;I could have used a code-word, perhaps the nickname Squidgy... I was trying to save her face in a way.&quot; However, having thought on it &quot;for a day, at least&quot;, Reenan decided that he &quot;would not get to see Diana.&quot; So he &quot;rang the Sun instead.&quot;

===Publication===
Published in &quot;The Sun&quot; on 23 August 1992, &quot;Squidgygate&quot; (initially called &quot;Dianagate&quot;) was the front-page revelation of the existence of a tape-recording of Diana, Princess of Wales talking to a close friend, who later turned out to be Gilbey, heir to the eponymous gin fortune. Gilbey, who initially denied &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s charges, was a 33-year-old Lotus car-dealer who had been a friend of Diana&#x27;s since childhood. Their conversation, which took place on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1989, was wide-ranging. A special phone line allowed about 60,000 callers to hear the contents of the 30-minute tape for themselves, at 36 pence per minute.

The tape begins in mid-conversation, with the man asking: &quot;And so, darling, what other lows today?&quot; To which the woman replies: &quot;I was very bad at lunch, and I nearly started blubbing. I just felt so sad and empty and thought &#x27;bloody hell, after all I&#x27;ve done for this fucking family...&#x27; It&#x27;s just so desperate. Always being innuendo, the fact that I&#x27;m going to do something dramatic because I can&#x27;t stand the confines of this marriage [...] He makes my life real torture, I&#x27;ve decided.&quot;

The conversation covered topics as diverse as the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and the strange looks that Diana received from the Queen Mother: &quot;It&#x27;s not hatred, it&#x27;s sort of pity and interest mixed in one [...] every time I look up, she&#x27;s looking at me, and then looks away and smiles.&quot; Additionally, in view of a fascination with spiritualism that was later to become well-known, Diana was also heard explaining how she had startled the Bishop of Norwich by claiming to be &quot;aware that people I have loved and [who] have died [...] are now in the spirit world, looking after me.&quot;

Diana expressed worries about whether a recent meeting with Gilbey would be discovered. She also discussed a fear of becoming pregnant, and Gilbey referred to her as &quot;Darling&quot; 53 times, and as &quot;Squidgy&quot; (or &quot;Squidge&quot;) 14 times.

===Second eavesdropper: Jane Norgrove===
On 5 September 1992, &quot;The Sun&quot; announced that the same call had also been recorded by an Oxfordshire eavesdropper, 25-year-old Jane Norgrove, who claimed she had recorded the call on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1989, but &quot;didn&#x27;t even listen to it. I just put the tape in a drawer. I didn&#x27;t play it until weeks later, and then I suddenly realised who was speaking on the tape.&quot;

In January 1991, after sitting on the tape for a year, Norgrove approached &quot;The Sun&quot;. The paper made a copy of her recording, and offered her £200 for her time: Norgrove refused the money, claiming that she &quot;got scared and didn&#x27;t want to know about it any more.&quot; Norgrove claimed: &quot;I wanted to speak out now to clear up all this nonsense about a conspiracy [...] I&#x27;m not part of a Palace plot to smear the Princess of Wales.&quot; &quot;The Sun&quot; had initially published the opinions of &quot;a senior courtier [who] claims the tape is part of a plot to blacken Diana&#x27;s name&quot; and the verdicts of other anonymous Palace staffers, who said that the tape was &quot;a sophisticated attempt to get even by friends loyal to Prince Charles after Diana&#x27;s co-operation with the book &quot;Diana: Her True Story&quot;, by Andrew Morton.&quot;

Such speculation had not been confined to tabloid newspapers: William Parsons, of anti-surveillance consultants Systems Elite, remarked that the technical and atmospheric requirements for such a recording to be possible (both halves of a cellular telephone call, with equal clarity, when the callers were over 100 miles apart, in different network cells), were so improbable as to arouse suspicion: &quot;My money would not be on somebody accidentally picking it up [...] There is more to this than meets the eye.&quot;

Jane Norgrove was adamant: &quot;It was just me, recording a telephone conversation in my bedroom. Nothing more and nothing less than that.&quot;

==Context and reaction==
According to Tina Brown, Diana and Gilbey had first met each other before her marriage to Charles and reconnected in the late 1980s. At the time of publication, the Prince and Princess of Wales, engaged in acrimonious pre-divorce proceedings, were involved in a protracted battle for public sympathy which became known as the &quot;War of the Waleses&quot;. The Duke and Duchess of York had separated months before, and now all eyes were on Charles and Diana, the next king and queen, whose marriage had been the subject of rumour for years.

Speculation in the media—and in court circles—reached fever pitch. In his memoirs, Diana&#x27;s private secretary Patrick Jephson recounts a fraught game of media one-upmanship by the feuding couple: secret briefings to friendly journalists, open collaboration with TV documentaries, and separate appearances at different public events on the same day were just some of the many strategies with which Charles and Diana attempted to force each other out of the limelight. Jephson recalls that the atmosphere at Kensington Palace at the time was &quot;like a slowly-spreading pool of blood leaking from under a locked door.&quot;

Throughout 1991 and into 1992, Diana had been secretly collaborating with a previously little-known court correspondent, Andrew Morton, on the book &quot;&quot;, which revealed in graphic detail the previously hidden disaster that the Waleses&#x27; marriage had become. Diana&#x27;s bulimia, suicide attempts and self-harm were spelt out unambiguously, as were Charles&#x27;s relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, and the intrigues of Palace officials in attempting to contain the disintegrating royal marriage.

==Analysis of the tape==
In 1993, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published the findings of an analysis of the &quot;Squidgygate&quot; tape, commissioned from Corby-based surveillance specialists Audiotel International.

Audiotel concluded that the presence of data bursts on the tape was suspicious. Data bursts (&quot;pips&quot; at intervals of approximately 10 seconds, containing information for billing purposes) would normally be filtered out at the exchange before Cellnet transmission. That these &quot;pips&quot; were present at all was therefore anomalous, but they were also too fast, too loud, and exhibited a &quot;low-frequency [audio] &#x27;shadow&#x27;,&quot; implying &quot;some kind of doctoring of the tape,&quot; said Audiotel&#x27;s managing director, Andrew Martin, in his firm&#x27;s report. &quot;The balance of probability suggests something irregular about the recording which may indicate a rebroadcasting of the conversation some time after the conversation took place.&quot;

Within a week of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;″s announcement, a further independent analysis was carried out for the same newspaper by John Nelson of Crew Green Consulting, with assistance from Martin Colloms, audio analyst for Sony International. Their analysis demonstrated convincingly that the conversation could not have been recorded by a scanning receiver in the manner claimed by Reenan. Amongst several relevant factors, there was a 50 hertz hum in the background of the &quot;Squidgygate&quot; conversation together with components in the recorded speech with frequencies in excess of 4 kHz. Neither could have passed through the filters of Reenan&#x27;s Icom receiver or indeed have been transmitted by the cellular telephone system. The 50 Hz hum was consistent with the effect of attempting to record a telephone conversation via a direct tap on a landline.

Since Gilbey was known to have been speaking from a mobile phone, inside a parked car, this left Diana&#x27;s telephone line at Sandringham as the source of the recording. Nelson&#x27;s analysis, written after a visit to Reenan and an examination of his unsophisticated receiving system (which consisted essentially of an Icom wideband scanning receiver and a conventional television antenna), showed that the recording was most likely to have been made as a result of a local tapping of the telephone line somewhere between Diana&#x27;s telephone itself, and the local exchange. Furthermore, narrow-band spectrum analysis showed this 50 Hz &quot;hum&quot; to consist of two separate but superimposed components, possibly indicating a remixing of the tape after the initial recording. The spectral frequency content of the tape was demonstrably inconsistent with its supposed origin as an off-air recording of an analogue cellular telephone channel but quite feasible if the recording had been made via a local-end direct tap.

As well as the strong technical case he made against the recording, Nelson established two other salient points. The first was that Gilbey&#x27;s mobile telephone was registered to the Cellnet network. Secondly, the Cellnet base-station transmitter site in Abingdon Town, the data channel of which was the only one receivable on Reenan&#x27;s receiving system at the time of his visit, was not in service at the date of the alleged telephone conversation; it was first commissioned on 3 March 1990. It was therefore not possible that the purported recording could have been made off-air by Reenan or Norgrove in December 1989 or January 1990.

With regard to the data-bursts that had aroused the suspicion of Audiotel International, Colloms and Nelson stated: &quot;We are forced to conclude that these data-bursts are not genuine, but were added later to the tape. They originated with a locally-made recording, and show that an attempt has been made to disguise a local tap by making it appear that it was recorded over cellular radio.&quot;

Telecommunications company Cellnet admitted that it had automatically conducted its own internal investigation after publication of the &quot;Squidgygate&quot; transcript, because Gilbey had been speaking on a Cellnet phone. &quot;It is a very sensitive issue if a cellular network has been bugged,&quot; said Cellnet spokesman William Ostrom: &quot;We wished to satisfy ourselves exactly what happened.&quot; Cellnet&#x27;s inquiry, claimed Ostrom, had &quot;replicated&quot; the findings of Colloms and Nelson: Cellnet announced that it was &quot;completely satisfied that we can dismiss this as an example of our network being eavesdropped.&quot;

==Government reaction==
Suspicion about responsibility for the &quot;Squidgygate&quot; leak focused on the United Kingdom&#x27;s security service, MI5. Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke said: &quot;The security services are strictly controlled in their telephone tapping, and I know of no evidence whatever to indicate that they were involved.&quot; Such suggestions, he added, were &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;extremely silly.&quot;

On the same day as these remarks, members of the Commons all-party Home Affairs Select Committee had their first meeting with Stella Rimington, director general of MI5. Committee member John Greenway MP (Conservative) remarked that the recent &quot;Camillagate&quot; leak &quot;strengthens the case for a parliamentary committee to have responsibility to oversee or scrutinise the work of the security services [...] I suspect that colleagues will want to ask how true the allegations [of MI5 complicity in the &#x27;Camillagate&#x27; leak] are, and I suspect that she [Rimington] will refuse to tell us.&quot; No record exists of matters discussed at the meeting.

The first major &quot;Establishment&quot; figure to question the official line on &quot;Squidgygate&quot; was Lord Rees-Mogg, the arch-conservative chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Authority. He had proved an early proponent of the &quot;rogue spies&quot; school of thought in January 1993, when he used his &quot;Times&quot; column to accuse elements within the British security services of being responsible for both the recording and its leak. &quot;All those tapes were made within a month,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The most likely explanation is that MI5 did it to protect the Royal Family at a time of danger from the IRA. I don&#x27;t think there was any sense of wrong-doing, but once they were made there was the danger of a leak.&quot;

A few days before Clarke&#x27;s remarks, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; had run with &quot;Camillagate&quot;, an eight-minute tape of Prince Charles engaging in explicit conversation with his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles. Richard Stott, editor of the &quot;Mirror&quot;, claimed that the tape had been recorded by &quot;a very ordinary member of the public&quot;, although the paper was not allowed to keep or to make a copy of the tape. But &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that an anonymous freelance journalist from Manchester was known to be attempting to sell a complete copy of the original tape, asking price £50,000. The re-ignition of the controversy over &quot;Squidgygate&quot; had been instantaneous: the date of the &quot;Camillagate&quot; recording was known to be 18 December 1989, just weeks before the &quot;Squidgygate&quot; tape had been recorded.

===Political fallout===
Before any investigation into &quot;Squidgygate&quot; or &quot;Camillagate&quot; had begun, Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke told the House of Commons: &quot;There is nothing to investigate. [...] I am absolutely certain that the allegation that this is anything to do with the security services or GCHQ [...] is being put out by newspapers, who I think feel rather guilty that they are using plainly tapped telephone calls.&quot;

The Labour Party, then in Opposition, accused Kenneth Clarke of irresponsibility, issuing a statement: &quot;He has to show that he is taking these allegations seriously, otherwise he will be perceived as being unable to control an organisation for which he is responsible.&quot;

===Official position===
John Major&#x27;s government eventually published two reports, both of which cleared MI5 and MI6 of involvement in the &quot;Royalgates&quot; tapes. One of these was the annual report of the Interceptions Commissioner, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, who oversaw the intelligence-gathering practices of the security services. Excerpt follows: &quot;[Lord Bingham] was impressed by the scrupulous adherence to the statutory provisions [against misconduct] of those involved in the [intelligence-gathering] procedures.&quot; In a clear reference to the &quot;Squidgygate&quot; affair, he commented on &quot;the stories which occasionally circulated in the press with regard to the interceptions by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ,&quot; stating that such stories were, in his experience, &quot;without exception false, and gave an entirely misleading impression to the public both of the extent of official interception and of the targets against which interception is directed.&quot;

Conservative MP Richard Shepherd called the official reports: &quot;two old buffers saying that in their opinion the security services act with integrity.&quot; The National Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke gave MPs &quot;a categorical assurance that the heads of the agencies concerned have said there is no truth in the rumours.&quot;

The Queen was so disturbed by the &quot;Squidgygate&quot; episode that she requested that MI5 conduct an investigation to discover the culprit or culprits. Since the motive could not have been financial, said the investigators—the only winners were the radio hams and the press—it must have been political.

In 2002, Diana&#x27;s former Personal Protection Officer, Inspector Ken Wharfe, stated that the investigation had &quot;identified all those involved, but for legal reasons I cannot expand further, and nor is it necessary to do so.&quot; Wharfe added that: &quot;It does [...] lend credence to the Princess&#x27;s belief, so often dismissed by her detractors, that the Establishment was out to destroy her.&quot;

<text>Fillmore East – June 1971 is a live album by The Mothers, released in 1971. It is the twelfth album in Frank Zappa&#x27;s discography, and was produced by Zappa and mixed by Toby Foster.

==History==

&quot;Fillmore East – June 1971&quot; is a live concept-like album. It portrays a peek-behind-the-curtain of the life of a rock band on the road as narrated by Frank Zappa, and contains many thematic elements that, because of time and budget constraints, couldn&#x27;t be included in the similar movie &quot;200 Motels&quot;. The most famous part of the album is &quot;The Mud Shark&quot;, a telling of a story told to Mother Don Preston by some members of Vanilla Fudge about a hotel, Seattle&#x27;s Edgewater Inn, where guests could fish from their rooms. In the tale, a mud shark is caught by one of the members of Vanilla Fudge or its crew and, when combined with a groupie and a movie camera, depravity ensues. Although not stated in &quot;The Mud Shark,&quot; this 1969 incident, now referred to as &quot;the Shark episode,&quot; also involved Led Zeppelin&#x27;s drummer John Bonham and road manager Richard Cole, with Vanilla Fudge&#x27;s singer/keyboardist Mark Stein operating the movie camera.

The band then portray stereotypically egotistical members of a rock band &quot;negotiating&quot; for sex with a groupie and her girlfriends. The girls are insulted that the band thinks they are groupies and that they would sleep with the band just because they are musicians. They have standards; they will only have sex with a guy in a group with a &quot;big, hit single in the charts – with a bullet!&quot; and a &quot;dick that’s a monster.&quot; In &quot;Bwana Dik&quot;, singer Howard Kaylan assures the girls that he is endowed beyond their &quot;wildest Clearasil-spattered fantasies.&quot; And, not to be put off by the standards of these groupies, the band sings the Turtles&#x27; hit &quot;Happy Together&quot; - Kaylan, Mark Volman, and Jim Pons having been members of the Turtles - to the girls to give them their &quot;bullet&quot;. The album ends with an encore excerpt including both Zappa&#x27;s familiar &quot;Peaches en Regalia&quot; and a pastiche of early-rock and roll, &quot;Tears Began to Fall&quot; (also issued as a single).

When this album was first reissued on compact disc by Rykodisc, &quot;Willie the Pimp, Pt. 2&quot; was omitted from the track line-up. It was released on CD on the 2012 reissue of the album. Also, in the CD edition, the last minute of &quot;Latex Solar Beef&quot; was placed at the beginning of &quot;Willie the Pimp Part One&quot;, making it longer. It is unclear if this was intentional or not.

==John &amp; Yoko and the Mothers==

As an encore on one of the two nights of this Fillmore East appearance John Lennon and Yoko Ono emerged from the wings to play a half hour set with the band. This part of the show was released under Lennon&#x27;s name on a disc called &quot;Live Jam&quot;, which was included as a bonus disc with Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;. It can also be heard on Zappa&#x27;s 1992 release &quot;Playground Psychotics&quot;. It also appears in its complete unedited version, along with the &quot;original&quot; version of &quot;Billy the Mountain&quot;, on the expanded triple-LP reissue of &quot;Fillmore East&quot; and the anniversary set The Mothers 1971, released simultaneously on March 18, 2022.

Lennon used a copy of the cover of the Zappa album (adding his own red-inked credits to the album&#x27;s black-ink handwritten ones) to provide liner notes for &quot;Live Jam&quot;.

==Track listing==

On early CD editions, &quot;Willie the Pimp Part Two&quot; was removed. The track was restored on the 2012 CD reissue.

<text>Bouchercon, the Anthony Boucher Memorial World Mystery Convention, is an annual convention of creators and devotees of mystery and detective fiction. It is named in honour of writer, reviewer, and editor Anthony Boucher, and pronounced the way he pronounced his name, rhyming with &quot;voucher&quot;.

It is held annually in Autumn, each year being hosted in a different city by a different group of volunteers. The convention typically starts on Thursday and finishes on Sunday.

Each year, Bouchercon nominates and votes the Anthony Awards for excellence in crime fiction, including: Best Novel, Best First Novel, Best Short Story, Best Critical Non-Fiction, and Best Paperback Original.

People who attend are fans, authors, agents, booksellers, publishers and other people who read and enjoy mystery and crime fiction. The first one was held in Santa Monica, California in 1970. The guest of honor was Robert Bloch of &quot;Psycho&quot; fame.

Registered attendees of each Bouchercon are designated as &#x27;members&#x27;, and vote at the annual business meeting (held during the convention) on necessary business items. Bouchercon&#x27;s governing body is its standing committee, which changes year to year, being made up of people who have hosted and will host the convention, and three at large members who are elected by the membership.

==Awards==

The Anthony Awards are literary awards for mystery writers presented at the Bouchercon World Mystery Convention since 1986. The awards are named for Anthony Boucher (1911–1968), one of the founders of the Mystery Writers of America.

<text>Hiroyuki Sanada (; ; born 12 October 1960) is a Japanese actor. He has received numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Japan Academy Film Prize, two Hochi Film Awards, a Mainichi Film Award, three Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Actor, four Kinema Junpo Awards, and honors from the Yokohama Film Festival. In 2018, he received the Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon from the Japanese government for his &quot;artistic developments, improvements, and accomplishments&quot;.

He began his career in the mid-1960s at the age of five, and was the protégé of actor Sonny Chiba. A black belt in Kyokushin Karate, he initially gained prominence for his roles in Japanese and Hong Kong action films, later establishing himself as a dramatic actor. He is best known to international audiences for his roles as Ryuji Takayama in &quot;Ring&quot; (1998) where he played alongside Nanako Matsushima, who was also his co-star in a 1997 television drama &quot;A Story of Love&quot;. His role as the Fool in a production of the Shakespeare play &quot;King Lear&quot; (1999–2000) gave him theatrical attention, and led to his appointment as an Honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2002. Beginning in the 2000s, Sanada grew his Hollywood presence with such roles as Seibei Iguchi in &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot; (2002), Ujio in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003), and Kenji in &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; (2007).

Sanada&#x27;s appearances in Hollywood films include &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2007), &quot;Speed Racer&quot; (2008), &quot;The Wolverine&quot;, &quot;47 Ronin&quot; (both 2013), &quot;Minions&quot; (2015), &quot;Life&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;Army of the Dead&quot; (2021), as Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2021), in &quot;Bullet Train&quot; (2022), and &quot;John Wick: Chapter 4&quot; (2023). He also had recurring roles on &quot;Lost&quot; (2010) and the HBO series &quot;Westworld&quot; (2018–2020). Sanada gained acclaim for his role in the FX historical drama series &quot;Shōgun&quot; (2024) as Yoshii Toranaga, the titular character, a fictionalized version of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Sanada won various best actor accolades for this role.

==Life and career==

=== 1966–1978: Child actor ===
Born in Tokyo, he was scouted by an entertainer while playing with the son of the actor Kokichi Takada who lived in the same condominium. After working as a model for a magazine for young children, he joined the Himawari Theatre Group at the age of five. Originally planning to be an action movie star, he studied Shorinji Kempo and later took up Kyokushin kaikan karate. He began playing baseball at age 8 as a catcher. Sanada was mentored by actor Shinichi &quot;Sonny&quot; Chiba, and was a member of his Japan Action Club (JAC), becoming his protégé.

At the age of five, Sanada had his first role in the 1966 film &quot;Game of Chance&quot; (浪曲子守唄) as the son of Chiba&#x27;s character. He had several roles in Japanese television and films, but quit temporarily so he could focus on living a normal childhood. He said this gave him &quot;a good chance to watch movies as the audience&quot;, helping his perspective. By his teenage years he knew how to act, fight, sing, dance, perform stunts, ride horseback, and had developed versatility. Sanada had noticed that many popular actors would develop such skills, and felt it was &quot;the best service for the audience&quot; to do so himself before he practised acting again. He began acting again with a part in a film by Japanese director Kinji Fukasaku.

=== 1982–1999: Japanese character roles ===
Sanada received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Film Science from Nihon University in 1982. In 1984, Sanada starred with Sonny Chiba and Hiroko Yakushimaru in &quot;Legend of the Eight Samurai&quot;, which became the number one film in Japan, earning ¥2.3 billion, and was later released in foreign language versions. This film established Sanada as an 80&#x27;s teen &quot;idol&quot; in Japan. In 1992, Sanada played Yoshinari, a stockbroker turned &quot;yakuza&quot; in the comedy film &quot;Keisho Sakazuki&quot; (&quot;Succession&quot;), with Ogata Ken. In 1997 Sanada starred in a television drama &quot;A Story of Love&quot;, also known by its Japanese title &quot;Konna Koi no Hanashi&quot;, where he played the role of Shuichiro Harashima, a wealthy but lonely upper-class businessman who falls in love with a decorating designer from a lower-class family played by Nanako Matsushima. The following year in 1998, Sanada once again co-starred with Nanako Matsushima in the mystery thriller &quot;Ringu&quot; (&quot;Ring&quot;) as Takayama Ryuji, the ex-husband of Matsushima&#x27;s character Reiko, a journalist investigating the death of her niece. Also in 1998, Sanada starred as Asami in Jun Ichikawa&#x27;s &quot;Tadon to Chikuwa&quot;. Sanada&#x27;s role followed the story of a writer suffering from writer&#x27;s block. In 1999, Sanada starred in &quot;Mayonaka Made&quot; (&quot;Round About Midnight&quot;) as Moriyama Koji, a confident jazz trumpet performer who performs at a club called Cotton Tail. In the film, Moriyama sees Michelle Reis&#x27;s character being attacked by two murderers, who they proceed to chase throughout the film.

=== 1999–2002: Royal Shakespeare Company ===
In 1999 and 2000, he performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in their production of &quot;King Lear&quot;. Producer Nigel Hawthorne personally invited Sanada to play the role, yet Sanada had doubts since he had not taken an English-language role before. Sanada was convinced after the producers assured him that he was &quot;an actor first before [being] Japanese or Asian&quot;. For this role, he was appointed an Honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2002, citing his &quot;contribution to spreading British culture in Japan.&quot; That year, Sanada played the lead role of the low-ranking Seibei Iguchi in &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot;. It follows the turbulent life and times of the character, and documents the financial woes that a 19th-century Japanese warrior could have faced.

=== 2003–2009: &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; and international breakthrough ===
In 2003, Sanada&#x27;s role as Ujio, a master swordsman, opposite Tom Cruise in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, brought him praise. Sanada played Matsuda, a man who befriends Ralph Fiennes&#x27; character Todd Jackson, in &quot;The White Countess&quot; (2005) directed by James Ivory. He starred in the Chinese film &quot;The Promise&quot; directed by Chen Kaige as General Guangming. Sanada appeared in &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; (2007) with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2007) as Kaneda, and &quot;The City of Your Final Destination&quot; (2009), in which he plays Pete, the younger lover of Anthony Hopkins&#x27;s character Adam Gund.

=== 2010–2020: &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Westworld&quot;, and &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; ===

Sanada joined the cast of the ABC TV series &quot;Lost&quot; in 2010 during its sixth and final season. He portrayed Dogen, a high-ranking member of &quot;The Others&quot;. In 2013, he appeared in &quot;47 Ronin&quot; (the first English-language adaptation of the Chushingura legend, Japan&#x27;s most famous tale of samurai loyalty and revenge) alongside Keanu Reeves, as Shingen Yashida in &quot;The Wolverine&quot; opposite Hugh Jackman, and as Takashi Nagase in &quot;The Railway Man&quot;, a story of vengeance and reconciliation co-starring Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth. He voiced &quot;Sumo Villain&quot; in &quot;Minions&quot;, a master of strength and power who pursues the Minions.

Sanada was a guest star as Takehaya, a former Japanese Navy officer and legendary pirate captain in post-plague Asia, in the apocalyptic drama series &quot;The Last Ship&quot;. He also starred in the 2017 movie &quot;Life&quot; with Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, and Ryan Reynolds. In 2018, he began a recurring role as swordmaster Musashi on the HBO series &quot;Westworld&quot; and played the minor role of Akihiko in the 2019 film &quot;&quot;. That year, he received the Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon from the Japanese government for his &quot;artistic developments, improvements, and accomplishments&quot; In August 2019, Sanada was cast in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot as Scorpion. In 2020, Sanada starred alongside Johnny Depp in the film &quot;Minamata&quot;. In 2021, he played the shrewd casino owner Bly Tanaka in Zack Snyder&#x27;s action film &quot;Army of the Dead&quot;.

=== 2021–present: &quot;Bullet Train&quot;, &quot;John Wick: Chapter 4&quot;, &quot;Shōgun&quot; ===

In 2022, Sanada took the major supporting role of the Elder in &quot;Bullet Train&quot; opposite Brad Pitt. In 2023, he portrayed Koji Shimazu, manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel, in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 4,&quot; and was featured in a multi-commercial campaign introducing Mazda CX-90.

In 2021, Sanada was announced as producer and part of the cast of the FX limited series &quot;Shōgun&quot;, adapted from the James Clavell novel, playing the part of Lord Toranaga. The series has received widespread global critical acclaim, with Sanada&#x27;s role in the series considered a highlight among many reviewers. In 2024, Sanada became the first Japanese actor or actress to win any Primetime Emmy, and specifically the first Japanese winner of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, for his role in &quot;Shōgun&quot;. Sanada also was a recipient of the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series for his role as a producer for the series. Sanada received the inaugural award for best TV series performance at the EnergaCamerimage International Film Festival for the role. He was nominated for the Gotham TV Award for Outstanding Performance in a Limited Series, and the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama. Sanada won the prize for Best Actor – Television Series Drama at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, and received the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series for the role.
