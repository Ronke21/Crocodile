<text>The Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG) is a division of the Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. CIRG enables the FBI to rapidly respond to, and effectively manage, special crisis incidents in the United States.

==History==
In response to public outcry over the standoffs at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and of the Branch Davidians in the Waco Siege, the FBI formed the CIRG in 1994 to deal with crisis situations more efficiently. The CIRG is designated to formulate strategies, manage hostage or siege situations, and if possible resolve them &quot;without loss of life&quot;, as pledged in a 1995 Senate hearing by FBI Director Louis Freeh, who assumed the post four-and-a-half months after the Waco Siege.

CIRG was intended to integrate tactical and investigative resources and expertise for critical incidents which necessitate an immediate response from law enforcement authorities. CIRG will deploy investigative specialists to respond to terrorist activities, hostage takings, child abductions and other high-risk repetitive violent crimes. Other major incidents include prison riots, bombings, air and train crashes, and natural disasters.

==Organization==
Each of the major areas of CIRG furnishes distinctive operational assistance and training to FBI field offices as well as state, local and international law enforcement agencies.

<text>Victoria cruziana (Santa Cruz water lily, water platter, yrupe, synonym Victoria argentina Burmeist.) is a tropical species of flowering plant, of the Nymphaeaceae family of water lilies native to South America, primarily Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay.

==Description==
The plant is a popular water garden plant in botanical gardens where its very large leaves can reach their fullest, up to 2 m wide with a thick rim up to 20 cm high, although rims up to nine inches (23 centimeters) have been recorded. It can be grown in cooler waters than its sisters within the genus, the more familiar giant waterlily, &quot;Victoria amazonica&quot; and the recently discovered &quot;Victoria boliviana&quot; . A 25 cm diameter flower blooms for two days, arising from the underwater bud, as a white flower that turns to a deep pink on the second and final day of its bloom. &quot;V. cruziana&quot; is a thermogenetic or heat-producing plant. The plant prefers to live in colder non moving water and requires warm temperatures in order for the flower to blossom, hence the plant must distribute a lot of energy to keep itself warmer than its natural environment (above 90 degrees Fahrenheit). The floral stigma are attached to a cup that is protected by spines, and the floral cup begins heating up in the bud, then, as the flower opens, it releases a strong sweet scent to attract pollinating beetles of the genus &quot;Cyclocephala&quot; of the family &quot;Scarabaeidae&quot;, then continues to provide heat to the flower while the beetles are pollinating.

==Cytology==
The diploid chromosome count of &quot;Victoria cruziana&quot; is 2n = 24. The chloroplast genome is 158993 bp long.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Victoria cruziana&quot; was discovered in Bolivia on one of many expeditions through the country by Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny whose presence was sponsored by Andrés de Santa Cruz. The first collected specimens were returned to France where they were named in honor of Santa Cruz by Alcide&#x27;s brother, Charles Henry Dessalines d&#x27;Orbigny.

It was first described in 1840 by Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny in Annales des Sciences Naturelles; Botanique, Ser. 2, 13, p. 57. Synonyms for &quot;Victoria cruziana&quot; A.D.Orb. are: &quot;Victoria argentina&quot; Burmeist. noun nud., &quot;Victoria cruziana&quot; var. &quot;malmei&quot; F.Henkel et al., &quot;Victoria cruziana&quot; f. &quot;matogrossensis&quot; Malme, &quot;Victoria cruziana&quot; f. &quot;trickeri&quot; F.Henkel ex Malme, &quot;Victoria cruziana&quot; var. &quot;trickeri&quot; F.Henkel et al., &quot;Victoria regia&quot; var (A.D.Orb.)

<doc id="1031639" wikidata="Q162070" url="?curid=1031639" title="Victoria amazonica">
<text>Victoria amazonica is a species of flowering plant, the second largest in the water lily family Nymphaeaceae. It is called Vitória-Régia or Iaupê-Jaçanã (&quot;the lilytrotter&#x27;s waterlily&quot;) in Brazil and Atun Sisac (&quot;great flower&quot;) in Inca (Quechua). Its native region is tropical South America, specifically Guyana and the Amazon Basin.

==Taxonomy==
The species is a member of the genus &quot;Victoria&quot;, placed in the family Nymphaeaceae or sometimes in the Euryalaceae. The first published description of the genus was by John Lindley in October 1837, based on specimens of this plant returned from British Guiana by Robert Schomburgk. Lindley named the genus after the newly ascended Queen Victoria, and the species &quot;Victoria regia&quot;. The spelling in Schomburgk&#x27;s description in &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, published the month before, was given as &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;. Despite this spelling being adopted by the Botanical Society of London for their new emblem, Lindley&#x27;s was the version used throughout the 19th century.

An earlier account of the species, &quot;Euryale amazonica&quot; by Eduard Friedrich Poeppig, in 1832 described an affinity with &quot;Euryale ferox&quot;. A collection and description was also made by the French botanist Aimé Bonpland in 1825. In 1850 James De Carle Sowerby recognized Poeppig&#x27;s earlier description and transferred its epithet &quot;amazonica&quot;. The new name was rejected by Lindley. The current name, &quot;Victoria amazonica&quot;, did not come into widespread use until the 20th century.

=== Cytology ===
The diploid chromosome count of &quot;Victoria amazonica&quot; is 20.

==Description==
&quot;Victoria amazonica&quot; has very large leaves (lamina) (and commonly called &quot;pads&quot; or &quot;lily pads&quot;), up to in diameter, that float on the water&#x27;s surface on a submerged stalk (petiole), in length, rivaling the length of the green anaconda, a snake local to its habitat. These leaves are enormously buoyant if the weight is distributed evenly over the entire surface of the leaf (as by a piece of plywood, which should be of neutral buoyancy). In 1896 a &quot;V. amazonica&quot; leaf at Tower Grove Park, Saint Louis, Missouri bore the &quot;unprecedented&quot; weight of 250 pounds (113.6 kg). However, in 1867 William Sowerby of Regents Park Botanic Garden in London placed 426 pounds (193.9 kg) on a leaf only 5&#x27; 6&quot; (168 cm) in diameter. One leaf of a specimen grown in Ghent, Belgium bore a load of 498 pounds (226 kg) It is the second-largest waterlily in the world.

&quot;V. amazonica&quot; is native to the shallow waters of the Amazon River basin, such as oxbow lakes (called iguarapes) and bayous (called paranas). In their native habitat, the flowers first begin to open as the sun starts to set and can take up to 48 hours to fully open up. These flowers can grow up to 40 cm (16 in) in diameter and 3.5 pounds ( 1.6 kilograms) in weight., exceeded in mass only by members of the genus &quot;Rafflesia&quot;. All of the flowers of one particular plant will, on a given evening, all be in the female phase or all in the male phase, so that pollination must be by a different individual, precluding self-pollination.

The stem and underside of the leaves are coated with many small spines to defend itself from fish and other herbivores that dwell underwater, although they can also play an offensive role in crushing rival plants in the vicinity as the lily unfolds as it aggressively seeks and hogs sunlight, depriving other plants directly beneath its leaves of such vital resource and significantly darkening the waters below. Younger giant water lilies are even known to swing their spiny stalks and buds around as they grow to forcibly make space for themselves.

== Ecology ==

Each plant continues to produce flowers for a full growing season, and they have co-evolved a mutualistic relationship with a species of scarab beetle of the genus &quot;Cyclocephala&quot; as a pollinator. All the buds in a single patch will begin to open at the same time and as they do, they give off a fruity smell. At this point the flower petals are white, and the beetles are attracted both to the colour and the smell of the flower. At nightfall the flower stops producing the odor, and it closes, trapping the beetles inside its carpellary appendages. Here, the stamens are protected by the paracarpels and for the next day the flower continues to remain closed. The cavity in which the beetle is trapped is composed of a spongy, starchy tissue that provides nourishment for the beetle. During this time, anthocyanins start to be released by the plant, which in turn changes the petals from white to a reddish pink colour, a sign that the flower will have been pollinated. As the beetle feeds inside the flower, the stamens fall inward and the anthers, which have already fallen, drop pollen on the stamens. During the evening of the second day, the flowers will have opened enough to release the beetle, and as it pushes its way through the stamens it becomes covered in pollen. These insects will then go on to find a newly opened water lily and pollinate with the pollen they are carrying from the previous flower. This process was described in detail by Sir Ghillean Prance and Jorge Arius.

==History==
&quot;Victoria regia&quot;, as it was named, was described by Tadeáš Haenke in 1801. It was once the subject of rivalry between Victorian gardeners in England. Always on the lookout for a spectacular new species with which to impress their peers, Victorian &quot;gardeners&quot; such as the Duke of Devonshire and the Duke of Northumberland started a well-mannered competition to become the first to cultivate and bring to flower this enormous lily. In the end, the two aforementioned dukes became the first to achieve this, Joseph Paxton (for the Duke of Devonshire) being the first in November 1849 by replicating the lily&#x27;s warm swampy habitat (not easy in winter in England with only coal-fired boilers for heating), and a &quot;Mr Ivison&quot; the second and more constantly successful (for Northumberland) at Syon House.

The species captured the imagination of the public and was the subject of several dedicated monographs. The botanical illustrations of cultivated specimens in Fitch and W.J. Hooker&#x27;s 1851 work &quot;Victoria Regia&quot; received critical acclaim in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, &quot;they are accurate, and they are beautiful&quot;. &quot;The Duke of Devonshire presented Queen Victoria with one of the first of these flowers and named it in her honour. The lily, with ribbed undersurface and leaves veining &quot;like transverse girders and supports&quot;, &quot;as Paxton&#x27;s inspiration for The Crystal Palace, a building four times the size of St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome.&quot;

It is depicted in the Guyanese coat of arms.

<doc id="1031641" wikidata="Q5196163" url="?curid=1031641" title="Pathogenicity island">
<text>Pathogenicity islands (PAIs), as termed in 1990, are a distinct class of genomic islands acquired by microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer. Pathogenicity islands are found in both animal and plant pathogens. Additionally, PAIs are found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. They are transferred through horizontal gene transfer events such as transfer by a plasmid, phage, or conjugative transposon. Although the general makeup of pathogenicity islands (PAIs) might vary throughout bacterial pathogen strains, all PAIs are known to have characteristics with all genomic islands, which includes virulence genes, functional mobility elements, and areas of homology to tRNA genes and direct repeats. Therefore, PAIs enables microorganisms to induce disease and also contribute to microorganisms&#x27; ability to evolve. The spread of antibiotic resistance and, more generally, the conversion of non-pathogenic strains in natural environments to strains that infect animal and plant hosts with disease are two examples of the evolutionary and ecological changes brought about by the transmission and acquisition of PAIs among bacterial species. However, It is impossible to overlook their impact on bacterial evolution, though, since if a PAI is acquired and is stably absorbed, it can irreversibly change the bacterial genome. 

One species of bacteria may have more than one PAI. For example, &quot;Salmonella&quot; has at least five. An analogous genomic structure in rhizobia is termed a &quot;symbiosis island&quot;.

==Properties==
Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are gene clusters incorporated in the genome, chromosomally or extrachromosomally, of pathogenic organisms, but are usually absent from those nonpathogenic organisms of the same or closely related species. They may be located on a bacterial chromosome or may be transferred within a plasmid or can be found in bacteriophage genomes. Every genomic island has the following characteristics; a GC- content that differs from the surrounding DNA sequence, a connection with tRNA genes, the presence of repeats on both ends (flanking), and the capacity to recombine, which is usually shown by the presence of an integrase. The GC-content and codon usage of pathogenicity islands often differs from that of the rest of the genome, potentially aiding in their detection within a given DNA sequence, unless the donor and recipient of the PAI have similar GC-content.

The most basic kind of mobile genetic element is an insertion sequence (IS), which usually just has one or two open reading frames that encode genes to make transposition easier. Sections inside the PAI may be rearranged or deleted with the use of IS components. These changes encourages adaption and aid in the generation of alternative strains. PAIs also contain transposons, which are more sophisticated forms of IS elements. The majority are surrounded by brief terminal inverted repeats that serve as homologous recombination sites, enhancing a PAI&#x27;s stability. Bacteriophage integrases also found on pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are enzymes produced by bacteriophages to enable site-specific recombination between two recognition sequences, serving as another form of mobility element to enable PAIs insertion into host DNA. PAIs are often associated with tRNA genes, which target sites for this integration event. Given that integration may result in tRNA truncation, it is probable that only non-essential tRNA loci found in multiple locations, or those possessing wobble capacity (the ability of a 5&#x27; base of a tRNA anticodon to mispair with the thrid base of an mRNA codon) can become common integration sites. They can be transferred as a single unit to new bacterial cells, thus conferring virulence to formerly benign strains.

Pathogenicity islands carry genes encoding one or more virulence factors, including, but not limited to, adhesins, secretion systems (type III and IV secretion system), toxins, invasins, modulins, effectors, superantigens, iron uptake systems, o-antigen synthesis, serum resistance, immunoglobulin A proteases, apoptosis, capsule synthesis, and plant tumorigenesis via &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;. Type III and type IV secretion systems, which are both expressed in Gram-negative bacteria, are the secretion systems most frequently linked to PAIs. The bacterial membranes contain the type III secretion system (T3SS), which functions essentially as a molecular syringe. The needle-like apparatus secretes effectors, which go from the bacterial cell to the host cell via the tip of the apparatus, creating a hole in the membrane of the host cell.

There are various combinations of regulation involving pathogenicity islands. The first combination is that the pathogenicity island contains the genes to regulate the virulence genes encoded on the PAI. The second combination is that the pathogenicity island contains the genes to regulate genes located outside of the pathogenicity island. Additionally, regulatory genes outside of the PAI may regulate virulence genes in the pathogenicity island. Regulation genes typically encoded on PAIs include AraC-like proteins and two-component response regulators.

PAIs can be considered unstable DNA regions as they are susceptible to deletions or mobilization. This may be due to the structure of PAIs, with direct repeats, insertion sequences and association with tRNA that enables deletion and mobilization at higher frequencies. Additionally, deletions of pathogenicity islands inserted in the genome can result in disrupting tRNA and subsequently affect the metabolism of the cell.

==Examples==
*The P fimbriae island contains virulence factors such as haemolysin, pili, cytotoxic necrosing factor, and uropathogenic specific protein (USP).
*&quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; high pathogenicity island I has genes regulating iron uptake and storage.
*&quot;Salmonella&quot; &quot;SP-1&quot; and &quot;SP-2&quot; sites regulates bacterium&#x27;s invasion and survival within host cells.
*&quot;Rhodococcus equi&quot; virulence plasmid pathogenicity island encodes virulence factors for proliferation in macrophages.
*The SaPI family of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; pathogenicity islands, mobile genetic elements, encode superantigens, including the gene for toxic shock syndrome toxin, and are mobilized at high frequencies by specific bacteriophages.
*Phage encoded Cholera toxin of &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, Diphtheria toxin of &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;, Neurotoxins of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; and Cytotoxin of &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;.
*&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; has two strains, one being more virulent than the other due to the presence of the &quot;Cag&quot; pathogenicity island.
*&quot;Escherichia coli&quot; pathogenicity island carries genes of toxins (eg., Shiga toxin) in enterohemorrhagic &quot;E. coli&quot; (EHEC) strains.

<text>Accord is an independent trade union, affiliated to the TUC and the Scottish TUC and specialized for around 25,000 staff in financial services, including members in the Lloyds Banking Group, MBNA, TSB, The Equitable Life Assurance Society and Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank.

==History==
Accord can trace its origins back to 1978, when it was founded as the Halifax Building Society Staff Association (HBSSA). The HBSSA was founded by John Simmons, the then manager of the Halifax branch in Plymouth. He had concluded that staff within the Halifax Building Society were in need of trade union representation, and had begun organising in earnest in 1977. Simmons was keen to avoid the use of the word &quot;union&quot; because of the negative connotations associated with militant trade unions in the UK in the 1970s. Accord&#x27;s headquarters, Simmons House, is named after John Simmons.

In 1978 Ernie Roberts was appointed as the first General Secretary. Branch reps were elected and Regional Committees established. From these groups a National Committee was elected, which met for the first time in August 1978. The HBSSA was formed. By the end of 1978 the HBSSA was recognised by the then Halifax Building Society &quot;as the sole bargaining agent for its members below Executive and Regional Manager level&quot;.

In January 1979 the HBSSA was granted its Certificate of Independence. This meant that it was recognised by the Government as a bona fide trades union and was afforded the rights to which it was entitled. In 1980 the HBSSA held its first conference in Manchester. In 1983 Ernie Roberts retired, allowing David Nash to become the second General Secretary. Bill Wright was appointed Assistant General Secretary.

At the 1994 Conference delegates voted to rename the HBSSA the Independent Union of Halifax Staff (IUHS). In 1995 the Halifax Building Society merged with the Leeds Permanent Building Society. The following year the Leeds Staff Association joined the IUHS. Also in 1996, The Halifax acquired the Clerical Medical Investment Group and in 1999 announced its merger with the Bank of Scotland. The union was therefore renamed again by delegates at the 2002 conference to reflect the diversity of its membership. From this point onwards it was known as Accord.

<doc id="1031650" wikidata="Q1388244" url="?curid=1031650" title="Alberto Breccia">
<text>Alberto Breccia (April 15, 1919 – November 10, 1993) was a Uruguayan-born Argentine artist and cartoonist. His son Enrique Breccia and daughter Patricia Breccia are also comic book artists.

Comic book author Frank Miller considers Breccia as one of his personal mentors, even declaring that (regarding modernity in comics): &quot;it all started with Breccia&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Montevideo, Uruguay, Breccia moved with his parents to Buenos Aires, Argentina, when he was three years old. After leaving school, Breccia worked in a tripe packing plant and in 1938 he got a job for the magazine &quot;El Resero&quot;, where he wrote articles and drew the covers.

He began to work professionally in 1939, when he joined the publishing house Manuel Láinez. He worked on magazines such as &quot;Tit-Bits&quot;, &quot;Rataplán&quot; and &quot;El Gorrión&quot; where he created comic strips such as &quot;Mariquita Terremoto&quot;, &quot;Kid Río Grande&quot;, &quot;El Vengador&quot; (based on a popular novel), and other adaptations.

During the 1950s he became an &quot;honorary&quot; member of the &quot;Group of Venice&quot; that consisted of expatriate Italian artists such as Hugo Pratt, Ivo Pavone, Horacio Lalia, Faustinelli and Ongaro. Other honorary members were Francisco Solano López, Carlo Cruz and Arturo Perez del Castillo. With Hugo Pratt, he started the Pan-American School of Art in Buenos Aires. In 1957 he joined publisher Editorial Frontera, under the direction of Héctor Germán Oesterheld, where he created several &quot;Ernie Pike&quot; stories. In 1958 Breccia&#x27;s series &quot;Sherlock Time&quot; ran in the comic magazine &quot;Hora Cero Extra&quot;, with scripts by Oesterheld.

In 1960 he began to work for European publishers via a Buenos Aires-based art agency: for British publishing house Fleetway he drew a few westerns and war stories. This period did not last long. His son Enrique Breccia would also draw a few war stories for Fleetway in the late 1960s, such as &quot;Spy 13&quot;.

Breccia and Oesterheld collaborated to produce one of the most important comic strips in history, &quot;Mort Cinder&quot;, in 1962. The face of the immortal Cinder is modeled after Breccia&#x27;s assistant, Horacio Lalia, and the appearance of his companion, the antique dealer Ezra Winston, is actually Breccia&#x27;s own. Cinder and Winston&#x27;s strip began on July 26, 1962, in issue Nº 714 of &quot;Misterix&quot; magazine, and ran until 1964 .

In 1968 Breccia was joined by his son, Enrique, in a project to draw the comic biography of &quot;Che&quot;, the life of Che Guevara, again with a script provided by Oesterheld. This comic book is considered the chief cause behind Oesterheld&#x27;s disappearance.

In 1969 Oesterheld rewrote the script of &quot;El Eternauta&quot;, for the Argentinian magazine &quot;Gente&quot;. Breccia drew the story with a decidedly experimental style, resorting to diverse techniques. The resulting work was anything but conventional and moving away from the commercial. Breccia refused to modify its style, which added to the tone of the script, and was much different from Francisco Solano López original.

During the seventies, Breccia makes major graphic innovations in black and white and color with series like &quot;Un tal Daneri&quot; and &quot;Chi ha paura delle fiabe?&quot;, written by Carlos Trillo. On the last one, a satire based on Brothers Grimm&#x27;s tales, he plays with texture, mixing collage, acrylic and watercolor. This technique will be used later in the eighties by American and British authors such as Bill Sienkiewicz and Dave McKean.

Other stories include: &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, &quot;Buscavidas&quot; (text by Carlos Trillo), a &quot;Historia grafica del Chile&quot; and &quot;Perramus&quot;, inspired by the work of the poet Juan Sasturain a pamphlet against the dictatorship in Argentina.

Breccia died in Buenos Aires in 1993.

<text>The 7.62×54mmR is a rimmed rifle cartridge developed by the Russian Empire and introduced as a service cartridge in 1891. Originally designed for the bolt-action Mosin–Nagant rifle, it was used during the late tsarist era and throughout the Soviet period to the present day. The cartridge remains one of the few standard-issue rimmed cartridges still in military use, and has one of the longest service lives of any military-issued cartridge.

The fully-powered 7.62×54mmR cartridge is still in use by the Russian military in the Dragunov (SVD), SV-98 and other sniper rifles, as well as some modern general-purpose machine guns like the PKM and Pecheneg machine gun. Originally, the round was designated &quot;Трехлинейный патрон образца 1891 года&quot; – (three-line cartridge model of 1891). It then became widely known under the designation &quot;7,62мм винтовочный патрон&quot; (7.62 mm rifle cartridge). The round has erroneously come to be known as the &quot;7.62mm Russian&quot; (and is still often referred to as such colloquially), but, according to standards, the &quot;R&quot; in designation (7.62×54mmR) stands for &quot;rimmed&quot;, in line with standard C.I.P. designations. The name is sometimes confused with the &quot;7.62 Soviet&quot; round, which refers to the rimless 7.62×39mm intermediate cartridge used in the SKS and AK-based (AK-47, RPK) rifles and light machine gun.

==Background==
The 7.62×54mmR is the second-oldest cartridge still in regular combat service with several major armed forces in the world. It is second to the .303 British which entered military service in 1889 and remains in service, primarily in some noncombatant Commonwealth nations around the world. In 2021, the cartridge reached 130 years in service. the 7.62×54mmR is mainly used in designated marksman and sniper rifles like the Dragunov sniper rifle, SV-98 and machine guns like the PKM. It is also one of the few (along with the .22 Hornet, .30-30 Winchester, and .303 British) bottlenecked, rimmed centerfire rifle cartridges still in common use today. Most of the bottleneck rimmed cartridges of the late 1880s and 1890s fell into disuse by the end of the First World War.

The .30-06 Springfield cartridge (7.62×63mm), with its higher service pressure and case capacity, will outperform the 7.62×54mmR when same-length test barrels are used, though this is very uncommon as .30-06 Springfield firearms are generally sold with much shorter barrels than 7.62×54mmR firearms. Commonly available 7.62×54mmR commercial ammunition chronographs around from the typical Mosin-Nagant (29-inch) barrel, while the heavier loads chonograph in the low range. This is identical to .30-06 Springfield performance from a 24-inch barrel and slightly better than .30-06 Springfield performance from a 22-inch barrel.

The 7.62×54mmR originally had a 13.7 g (210 grain) &quot;jager&quot; round-nosed full metal jacket (FMJ) bullet. The projectile was replaced in 1908 by the Лёгкая Пуля (&quot;Lyogkaya pulya&quot;, &quot;light bullet&quot;) spitzer bullet, whose basic design has remained to the present. The &quot;Lyogkaya pulya&quot;, or &quot;L&quot;-bullet, had a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.338 and (G7 BC) of approximately 0.185.

===Sniper rounds===
To increase accuracy for the Dragunov SVD, the Soviets developed the 7N1 variant of the cartridge in 1966. The 7N1 was developed by V. M. Sabelnikov, P. P. Sazonov and V. M. Dvorianinov. It used match-grade extruded powder instead of the coarser ball propellant and had a boat-tailed FMJ jacketed projectile with an air pocket, a steel core and a lead knocker in the base for maximum terminal effect. It had a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.411 and (G7 BC) of approximately 0.206. Produced by &quot;Factory 188&quot; (Novosibirsk Low Voltage Equipment Plant), cartridges are only head-stamped with the number &quot;188&quot; and the year of manufacture. It came packaged 20 loose rounds to a paper packet, 22 packets to a metal &quot;spam&quot; tin, and two tins per wooden case, for a total of 880 rounds. The individual paper packets, hermetically sealed metal &#x27;spam&#x27; cans, and wooden shipping crates were all distinctly marked &quot;Снайперская&quot; (&quot;Snaiperskaya&quot;, the adjective form of &quot;sniper&quot;). Even the wax wrapping paper for the paper packets was covered in red text to make sure it was not misused.

As hard body armor saw increasing use in militaries, the 7N1 was replaced in 1999 by the 7N14 special load developed for the SVD. The 7N14 round is loaded with a projectile containing a sharp hardened steel penetrator to improve penetration which is fired with an average muzzle velocity of , for a muzzle energy of .

==Cartridge dimensions==
The 7.62×54mmR has a 4.16 mL (64 gr H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt-action rifles and machine guns alike, under challenging conditions.

7.62×54mmR maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).

Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 18.5 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in), 4 grooves, Ø lands = 7.62 mm (0.300 in), Ø grooves = 7.92 mm (0.312 in), land width = 3.81 mm and the primer type is Berdan or very rarely Boxer (in large rifle size).

According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) rulings the 7.62×54mmR can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P.-regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that 7.62×54mmR-chambered arms in C.I.P.-regulated countries are currently (2014) proof tested at PE piezo pressure.

==Performance==

The attainable muzzle velocities and muzzle energies of the 7.62×54mmR are comparable with standard 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges. However, a rimmed case such as the one used in the 7.62×54mmR cartridge can complicate smooth feeding within box magazines, but they are by no means unreliable.

When used with modern hunting bullets, the 7.62×54mmR is capable of taking game in the medium- to large-sized class (CXP2 and CXP3). The 7.62×54mmR can offer very good penetrating ability due to a fast twist rate that enables it to fire long, heavy bullets with a high sectional density. In Russia, the 7.62×54mmR is commonly used for hunting purposes, mostly in sporterized Mosin–Nagant rifles and civil Dragunov variants (Tigers).

===Basic specifications of 21st century Russian service loads===
The 7.62×54mmR rounds in use with the Russian Armed Forces are designed for machine guns and sniper rifles. As of 2003, there were several variants of 7.62×54mmR rounds produced for various purposes. All use clad metal as case material.
;57-N-323S
:A conventional steel-core bullet designed to engage personnel and weapon systems. The bullet has a steel core and has a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.374 and (G7 BC) of approximately 0.187. The tip has no distinguishing colour. It can penetrate a thick St3 steel plate at and 6Zh85T body armor at .
;7N13
:An enhanced-penetration bullet designed to kill personnel wearing body armor, featuring a heat-strengthened core. The tip is uncoloured. A sealing lacquer belt on the mouth of the case is red-coloured. It can penetrate a thick St3 steel plate at and 6Zh85T body armor at .
;7T2
:A variant of the T-46, a tracer bullet designed for fire adjustment and target designation. The bullet has a green tip, and the tracer burns for 3 seconds.
;7BZ3
:A variant of the B-32, an armor-piercing/incendiary bullet designed to defeat lightly armored targets. The bullet has a black-red tip.

* R50 at means the closest 50% of the shot group will all be within a circle of the mentioned diameter at .
* R100 at means every shot of the shot group will be within a circle of the mentioned diameter at .

==Availability==
7.62×54mmR is widely available both as military surplus and new production, but less so for match-grade rounds. Most surplus ammunition is steel-cased and uses Berdan primers, which effectively hinders its use for handloading. However, with the increased popularity of surplus Eastern-bloc Mosin–Nagant, SVT-40, and PSL rifles in the United States, Boxer-primed ammunition and unfired cases are increasingly available; these cases take large rifle primers.

<text>The Highway of Death ( &quot;ṭarīq al-mawt&quot;) is a six-lane highway between Kuwait and Iraq, officially known as Highway 80. It runs from Kuwait City to the border town of Safwan in Iraq and then on to the Iraqi city of Basra. The road was used by Iraqi armored divisions for the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It was repaired after the Gulf War and used by U.S. and British forces in the initial stages of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

During the American-led coalition offensive in the Persian Gulf War, American, Canadian, British, and French aircraft and ground forces attacked retreating Iraqi military personnel attempting to leave Kuwait on the night of February 26–27, 1991, resulting in the destruction of hundreds of vehicles and the deaths of many of their occupants. Between 1,400 and 2,000 vehicles were hit or abandoned on the main Highway 80 north of Al Jahra.

The scenes of devastation on the road are some of the most recognizable images of the war, and it has been suggested that they were a factor in President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s decision to declare a cessation of hostilities the next day. Many Iraqi forces successfully escaped across the Euphrates river, and the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency estimated that upwards of 70,000 to 80,000 troops from defeated divisions in Kuwait might have fled into Basra, evading capture.

==Highway 80==
The attack began on the 26th when A-6 Intruder attack jets of the United States Marine Corps&#x27; 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing blocked the head and tail of the column on Highway 80, bombarding a massive vehicle column of mostly Iraqi Regular Army forces with Mk-20 Rockeye II cluster bombs, effectively boxing in the Iraqi forces in an enormous traffic jam as the turkey shoot began in earnest, setting up targets for subsequent airstrikes. Over the next ten hours, scores of U.S. Marine, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aircraft from USS &quot;Ranger&quot; (CV/CVA-61) attacked the convoy using a variety of weapons. Vehicles surviving the air attacks were later engaged by arriving coalition ground units, while most of the vehicles that managed to evade the traffic jam and continued to drive on the road north were targeted individually. The road bottle-neck near the Mutla Ridge police station was reduced to a long uninterrupted line of more than 300 stuck and abandoned vehicles sometimes called the Mile of Death. The wreckage found on the highway consisted of at least 28 tanks and other armored vehicles with many more commandeered civilian cars and buses filled with stolen Kuwaiti property. 

The death toll from the attack remains unknown. British journalist Robert Fisk said he &quot;lost count of the Iraqi corpses crammed into the smoldering wreckage or slumped face down in the sand&quot; at the main site and saw hundreds of corpses strewn up the road all the way to the Iraqi border. American journalist Bob Drogin reported seeing &quot;scores&quot; of dead soldiers &quot;in and around the vehicles, mangled and bloated in the drifting desert sands.&quot; A 2003 study by the Project on Defense Alternatives (PDA) estimated fewer than 10,000 people rode in the cut-off main caravan, and when the bombing started most simply left their vehicles to escape through the desert or into the nearby swamps where some died from their wounds and some were later taken prisoner. According to PDA, the often repeated low estimate of the numbers killed in the attack is 200–300 reported by journalist Michael Kelly (who personally counted 37 bodies), but a minimum death toll of at least 500–600 seems more plausible.

In 1993, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; interviewed an Iraqi survivor of the attacks:

==Highway 8==
Iraqi forces including the elite Iraqi Republican Guard&#x27;s 1st Armored Division &quot;Hammurabi&quot; were trying to either redeploy or escape on and near Highway 8, the continuation of Highway 80 in Iraq. They were engaged over a much larger area in smaller groups by U.S. artillery units and a battalion of AH-64 Apache attack helicopters operating under the command of General Barry McCaffrey. Hundreds of predominantly military Iraqi vehicles grouped in defensive formations of approximately a dozen vehicles were then systematically destroyed along a 50-mile stretch of the highway and nearby desert.

PDA estimated the number killed there to be in the range of 300–400 or more, bringing the likely total number of fatalities along both highways to at least 800 or 1,000. A large column composed of remnants of the Hammurabi Division attempting to withdraw to safety in Baghdad were also engaged and obliterated deep inside Iraqi territory by Gen. McCaffrey&#x27;s forces a few days later on March 2, in a post-war &quot;turkey shoot&quot;-style incident known as Battle of Rumaila. &#x27;

==Controversies==

The attacks were controversial, with some commentators arguing that they represented disproportionate use of force, saying that the Iraqi forces were retreating from Kuwait in compliance with the original UN Resolution 660 of August 2, 1990, and that the column included Kuwaiti hostages and civilian refugees. The refugees were reported to have included women and children family members of pro-Iraqi, PLO-aligned Palestinian militants and Kuwaiti collaborators who had fled shortly before the returning Kuwaiti authorities pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. Activist and former United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark argued that these attacks violated the Third Geneva Convention, Common Article 3, which outlaws the killing of soldiers who &quot;are out of combat.&quot; Clark included it in his 1991 report &quot;WAR CRIMES: A Report on United States War Crimes Against Iraq to the Commission of Inquiry for the International War Crimes Tribunal&quot;. However Geneva Protocol I Article 41.2 states that to be considered &quot;hors de combat&quot; or &quot;out of combat&quot; a soldier must be &quot;in the power of an adverse Party&quot; and have expressed an intent to surrender. It additionally states that an attempt to escape would remove this protected status.

Additionally, journalist Seymour Hersh, citing American witnesses, alleged that a platoon of U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicles from the 1st Brigade, 24th Infantry Division opened fire on a large group of more than 350 disarmed Iraqi soldiers who had surrendered at a makeshift military checkpoint after fleeing the devastation on Highway 8 on February 27, apparently hitting some or all of them. The U.S. Military Intelligence personnel who were manning the checkpoint claimed they too were fired on from the same vehicles and barely fled by car during the incident. Journalist Georgie Anne Geyer criticized Hersh&#x27;s article, saying that he offered &quot;no real proof at all that such charges—which were aired, investigated and then dismissed by the military after the war—are true.&quot;

Before the U.S. Military Police were deployed to guard the wreckage, looting of functional Iraqi weapons took place.

General Norman Schwarzkopf stated in 1995:

According to the Foreign Policy Research Institute, however, &quot;appearances were deceiving&quot;:

Photojournalist Peter Turnley published photographs of mass burials at the scene. Turnley wrote:

&quot;Time&quot; magazine commented:
==In popular culture==
* In 1991, &quot;The Guardian&quot; commissioned British anti-war poet Tony Harrison to commemorate the war, and in particular the Highway of Death. His poem, &quot;A Cold Coming&quot;, began with an ekphrastic representation of a graphic photograph taken on Highway 8 by photojournalist Kenneth Jarecke.
* The 1992 song &quot;Hero&quot; by the industrial metal band Ministry directly mentions the Highway of Death at the end of its first verse.
* Iain Banks&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Complicity&quot; has chapter 12 (of 13) called &quot;Basra Road&quot; and uses the imagery, although not the phrase.
* Galician band Siniestro Total recorded &#x27;Autopista de Basora&#x27; for their 1993 album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;.
* The 2005 film &quot;Jarhead&quot; contains a scene in which a group of U.S. Marines pass through the Highway of Death.
* In the 2019 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare&quot;, a similarly bombarded road in the fictional middle-eastern country of Urzikstan is named the Highway of Death. In this instance the attack is carried out by Russian forces, which led to accusations against the game of historical revisionism.

<doc id="1031677" wikidata="Q6670591" url="?curid=1031677" title="London Midland Region of British Railways">
<text>The London Midland Region (LMR) was one of the six regions created on the formation of the nationalised British Railways (BR), and initially consisted of ex-London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) lines in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The region was managed first from buildings adjacent to Euston station, and later from Stanier House in Birmingham. It existed from the creation of BR in 1948, ceased to be an operating unit in its own right in the 1980s, and was wound up at the end of 1992.

== Territory ==
At its inception, the LMR&#x27;s territory consisted of ex-LMS lines in England and Wales. The Mersey Railway, which had avoided being &quot;Grouped&quot; with the LMS in 1923, also joined the LMR. The LMR&#x27;s territory principally consisted of the West Coast Main Line (WCML), the Midland Main Line (MML) south of Carlisle, and the ex-Midland Cross Country route from Bristol to Leeds.

During the LMR&#x27;s existence there were a number of transfers of territory to and from other regions. The major changes were:

* In 1949 the London, Tilbury and Southend line, which was completely cut off from the rest of the LMR network, transferred to the Eastern
* Also in 1949, the isolated from the rest of the LMR ex-LMS Northern Counties Committee railway lines in Northern Ireland were bought by the Ulster Transport Authority.
* In 1958 a major re-drawing of the regional boundaries took place. LMR lines in South Wales and south-west of Birmingham were transferred to the Western; lines in Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire went to the Eastern; in North and West Yorkshire to the North Eastern. In return, the London Midland gained the former Great Central Railway laying outside Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.
* In 1974, the Chiltern Main Line from London Marylebone to and was transferred to the LMR from the Western Region.

== Locomotives and rolling stock ==

The LMR inherited ex-LMS types of steam locomotive. For a few months in early 1948, an M prefix was added to existing LMS locomotive numbers. From mid-1948, 40000 was added, giving numbers of ex-LMS types in the 4XXXX and 5XXXX series. Some elderly locomotive classes were renumbered in the 58XXX series to make way for new production of LMS designs.

The LMR initially continued building ex-LMS stock, particularly Black Fives, Ivatt 2MT, two Duchesses, and rebuilds of Royal Scots and Patriots. Stanier &quot;Period III&quot; carriages continued to be built and were developed into a new style known as &quot;Porthole&quot; stock. Freight stock on order at Nationalisation was completed: some LMS designs were accepted as BR standard designs and continued to be built for the whole network through the 1950s and early 1960s.

The LMR had some experimental diesel locomotives, such as the Class D16/1 and &quot;Fell locomotive&quot; 10100.
In August 1968 it was the last region of BR to eliminate steam traction under the 1955 Modernisation Plan.

== West Coast Main Line electrification ==

In the 1960s, the West Coast Main Line was electrified between London Euston and Crewe, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham. This was extended via to Glasgow in the 1970s.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Shao studied at Zhejiang High School in Hangzhou (杭州) and graduated in 1902. After his graduation, he went back to Jinhua and taught at the Jinhua No. 1 High School of Zhejiang. At that time, he started writing articles for several newspapers in Shanghai. In 1912, Shao established &quot;Hanmin Daily&quot; ( 漢民日報) with Han Sin Jai in Hangzhou. Following the Xinhai Revolution (1911), in 1913 he was arrested and sent to jail, being charged with &quot;accusing the government with bad intention&quot; because of his opposition to president Yuan Shikai (袁世凱). In the spring of 1914, he was rescued from the prison and fled to Japan. It was in Japan where he wrote large numbers of journal articles and critiques for two Chinese papers: &quot;Shenbao&quot; (申報) and &quot;Current Issues in Xinbao&quot; ().

=== Career ===
In 1916, Shao returned to China and was soon appointed as the first Beijing correspondent of &quot;Shenbao&quot;, the oldest Shanghai newspaper with the largest circulation at that time. During his time in Beijing, Shao was impressed by the emergence of the New Culture Movement (新文化運動).

As the movement launched, Shao widely spread the idea of patriotism and democracy while promoting journalism in a revolutionary way. He established the News Editing Society (新聞編譯社), which was the first Editing Society established in China, and published the Beijing Special Notice(北京特別通訊), which contained more than 200 articles. His works facilitated the improvement of Chinese newspapers.

In 1918, Shao established a very influential paper in northern China called &quot;Jing Bao&quot;. However, it was put under suspension in 1919 because the official government was offended by its critiques. It was relaunched in 1920 with the support of Shao&#x27;s wife. Yet, due to &quot;Jing Bao&quot;&#x27;s stance against the warlord government, Shao was charged with &quot;promoting communism, colluding with Russia&quot;, according to the decision of warlord Zhang Zuolin (張作霖).

=== Death ===
Shao was detested by contemporary warlord government since he constantly offended the officials. On 26 April 1926, Shao was arrested by military officials and executed in Beijing at his age of 40. In memory of him, the Memorial Hall was built in Hengdian Town of Dongyang City, 5 kilometers from Zixi Village, the birthplace of Shao.

== Contribution to journalism ==
Shao Piaoping was a pioneer of journalism during the early 20th century in China. His major contributions included: reforming the style and practice of newspaper, combating censorship, and laying out the guidelines for journalists.

=== Newspaper reform ===
Shao observed that there were numerous problems with the newspapers in his time. The first and most prominent problem was a biased viewpoint caused by limited sources and pressure from authorities. During the years 1910–1925 in particular, many Chinese newspapers fell under the influence of different parties. For instance, &quot;Beijing Shi Bao&quot; (北京時報) was controlled by Duan Qirui (段祺瑞), a powerful warlord; &quot;Huang Bao&quot;, on the other hand, was under the control of Zhang Zongchang (張宗昌), another warlord; and &quot;Chen Bao&quot; was under the direct control of Yan Jiu Xi, yet another warlord. Additionally, &quot;Shun Tian Shi Bao&quot; was run by the Japanese. In view of this, Shao advocated that journalists should report truthfully and practice the discipline of verification. He put this principle into practice when working for &quot;Shenbao&quot;.

Another problem of news organizations in China, especially in the 1910s, was the heavy dependence on foreign news agencies. Shao found this practice a barrier to the development of Chinese journalism because when journalists only copied the news scripts offered by foreign organizations, they failed to produce news on their own through self-exploration of the truth. Thus, in 1917, Shao requested local reporters working for &quot;Shenbao&quot; to increase the length of their texts from 200 words per article to 500. He also enlarged the coverage of news to include local news, foreign news, and domestic and foreign government policies and critiques.

=== Combating censorship ===
In the 1910s, when China was under the repressive rule of warlords, freedom of speech was suppressed and newspapers were under strict censorship. Despite this, Shao insisted on reporting political and military news on &quot;Shenbao&quot;, at a time when most journalists were confined to reporting on non-political and non-military issues. Although the government was occasionally offended by Shao&#x27;s daring practice, he managed to reveal the down-to-earth truth to the public with the help of his keen social skills and wide interpersonal network with officials.

Shao&#x27;s actions demonstrated that democratic and free journalism can be a powerful weapon against a repressive government. This increased the public&#x27;s appreciation that freedom of speech and publication would not be granted by the government unless they fought for it. Journalists were also inspired, and guidance was provided on combating censorship.

=== Journalism guidelines ===
Summarized from the books, articles, and speeches by Shao, he believed that in order to be a good journalist, one should:

# be aware of the current affairs.
# be able to analyze and understand the background of news.
# emphasize the ability to judge the value of news, and the complex and changing situation.
# have the courage to stand against any pressure from authorities (e.g. the warlords).
# be aware of the fact that one is influential to society and has the power to change it through reporting the news.
# stay in close touch with different social classes in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the society and the different needs of the readers.
# have common sense.
# keep the news comprehensive, that is to be able to choose the news of the highest value, from the most appropriate time and of the most interest to the readers.
# be observant, analytical, and imaginative.
# be communicative and organized in news writing to ensure that the news is understandable, systematic, comprehensive, and persuasive.

=== &quot;Jing Bao&quot; ===
The newspaper &quot;Jing Bao&quot; () was set up in October 1918 with two main objectives: (1) to provide an independent platform for the public to express their opinions, and (2) to act against the malpractices of contemporary journalism, such as reporting faulty and biased news. When &quot;Jing Bao&quot; was first launched, Shao wrote the famous slogan &quot;Tie Jian La Shou&quot; () meaning that it is the newspaper&#x27;s responsibility to criticize whatever injustice exists in society. He hoped to remind himself and his co-workers to retain the essence of journalism, namely a critical manner and objectivity.

In its early stages, &quot;Jing Bao&quot; mainly reported news concerning social issues, the economy, finance, diplomacy, education, art, and literature. In addition, it acted as a means to deliver notice from the government. In its later stage, it also focused on political and military news, Sino-foreign relationships, and culture. With its revolutionary way of reporting and its diverse coverage, &quot;Jing Bao&quot; became a popular newspaper at that time in Beijing.

In order to enrich the contents of the paper, supplementary papers including &quot;Xiao Jing Bao&quot; () and &quot;Jing Bao Supplementary Paper&quot; (京報副刊) were added. Famous writers such as Lu Xun (魯迅) and Sun Fu Yuan (孫伏園) also wrote for the supplementary papers.

&quot;Jing Bao Supplementary Paper&quot; included different topics including social science, economy, literature, science, and religion. It emphasized the freedom of speech and encouraged people, particularly young writers, to express their opinions. This laid the foundation for the establishment of The Journalism Study Society of Beijing University (北京大學新聞研討會).

== Contribution to journalism education ==

=== Establishment of The Journalism Study Society of Beijing University (北京大學新聞研究會) ===
As a supporter of the study of journalism in China, Shao joined the Journalism Study Society at the University of Beijing in 1918. The society recruited 113 students, among them the later famous political leader Mao Zedong (毛澤東).

Shao introduced the western model of journalism and shared his experience as a journalist with the students. He kept reminding his students that morality—particularly in terms of helping the poor and undermining the power of the despots—was the most crucial element for journalists. He also made it clear to his students that journalists should verify the authenticity of news and be truthful to the readers. He told his students about the need to observe, apply logical thinking and imagination, and to judge the value of news. At the same time, he taught his students the basic concepts of journalism, including techniques of interviewing, truthfulness of news, the timing of news-reporting, and even the importance to a journalist of his appearance, language, and attitude.

Shao also arranged visits to news agencies for his students in order to have a taste of the real world. The students were encouraged to submit writings to newspapers. As a result, the Journalism Study Society, with the organized training of young journalists, generated a group of intellectuals who later became the pillar of modern journalism in China.

=== Books and writings on journalism ===
During the first two years when Shao worked as the Beijing correspondent of &quot;Shenbao&quot;, he wrote 251 articles with more than 220,000 words. In 1923, he published the books &quot;Practical Applied Journalism&quot; (實際應用新聞學) and &quot;The Journalism Pandect&quot; (新聞學總論), which focused on the discipline of journalism and promoted social justice and political renewal. In 1917, he published a famous article entitled &quot;The hostile relation between the World and my country&quot; (我國與世界戰局) in &quot;Shenbao&quot;. The article revealed the relationships among nations during the First World War and gave the Chinese a clearer picture of what was happening in the world. His other famous writings include, the &quot;General studies of Sociological Ideologies in other countries&quot; (綜合研究各國社會思潮), &quot;Studies of New Russia&quot; (新俄國之研究), and the &quot;Collection of Shao Piaoping&#x27;s Articles&quot; (邵飄萍新聞通訊選).

== Influence on literature ==
After &quot;Jing Bao&quot; was relaunched in 1920, Shao focused on writing supplementary papers which contained a variety of literary content. &quot;Xiao Jing Bao&quot; (小京報) was the first of them. Later, Shao cooperated with the famous universities in Beijing to publish more supplementary papers. In total there were more than 10 supplementary papers, including &quot;Film Weekly&quot; (戲劇周刊), &quot;Women Weekly&quot; (婦女周刊), &quot;Human Arts Weekly&quot; (民眾文藝周刊), &quot;Economics Bimonthly&quot; (經濟半月刊), and &quot;Social Science Bimonthly&quot; (社會科學半月刊). He even invited Lu Xun (魯迅) to write the famous paper &quot;Mang Yuan&quot; (莽原). The contents of these papers were of great diversity, including film review, art, culture, and literature. Freedom of speech in these supplementary papers was maintained and Shao claimed that the principles of these papers could differ from those of &quot;Jing Bao&quot; based on their different nature.

Inspired by Shao&#x27;s efforts in expanding the coverage of newspapers to include literary contents, his students Zhang Youluan (張友鵉), Zhao Shaojun (周紹鈞), and Huang Jinqing (黃近青) established the Xingxing Literature Society (星星文學社) and published &quot;Literature Weekly&quot; (文學周刊).

== Political views ==

=== Objection to the government ===
While Shao was recognized as an outstanding journalist, politics was an inseparable ingredient in his journalistic career. Shao foresaw Yuan Shikai&#x27;s aggression to set up his own regime and thus launched the anti-Yuan force in China. His open objection to the new power naturally put him in trouble. Shao was arrested twice and his newspaper &quot;Hanmin Daily&quot; was forced to close down. He fled to Japan to continue working in the field of journalism. He was the earliest to unveil Yuan&#x27;s conspiracy in accepting the infamous Twenty-One Demands proposed by Imperial Japan. In December 1916, he flew back to China to join the protest against Yuan&#x27;s coronation.

During the May Fourth Movement (五四運動) in 1919, Shao took part in rallying for the support of Chinese students to save the country from Japanese aggression. He spoke at the University of Beijing on the reasons for China&#x27;s frustration at the Paris Peace Conference and criticized the weaknesses of the Chinese Government in &quot;Jing Bao&quot;. This again agitated the authorities and eventually the newspaper was put under suspension. After fleeing to Japan for refuge, he returned to China when Duan Qi Rui&#x27;s (段祺瑞) government lost power in 1920.

In 1925, he became a secret member of the Chinese Communist Party where he made large numbers of reports on the communist movement. A year later, the Chinese military, under the command of Zhang Zuolin (張作霖), executed Shao without trial, claiming that he &quot;propagandized communism&quot;.

=== Involvement in the Communist Party ===
When the operation of &quot;Jing Bao&quot; was restarted in 1920, Shao published an article entitled &quot;Study of the New Russia&quot; (新俄國之研究). His aims were to introduce the theory of Karl Marx to the Chinese people, and more importantly, to promote the way he believed that could save China, which was revolution. The article presented the theory of socialism, glorified the October Revolution in the Soviet Union in 1917, and promoted the success of Union of Soviet Socialists Republics (USSR). The article sowed the seeds of communism in the hearts of many Chinese. Later, in 1921, Shao joined the &quot;Marxist theory Study Society&quot; (馬克斯學說研究會). He strongly promoted communism while discouraging capitalism. In 1925, he joined the Chinese Communist Party (中國共產黨).

<doc id="1031689" wikidata="Q4968393" url="?curid=1031689" title="Brink's-Mat robbery">
<text>The Brink&#x27;s-Mat robbery was one of the largest robberies in British history, with £26 million (equivalent to £ in ) worth of gold bullion, diamonds, and cash stolen. It occurred at the Heathrow International Trading Estate, London, on 26 November 1983, from a warehouse operated by Brink&#x27;s-Mat, a former joint venture between US security company Brink&#x27;s and London-based company MAT Transport. The bullion was the property of Johnson Matthey Bankers Ltd. Micky McAvoy and Brian Robinson were convicted of armed robbery. Most of the gold has never been recovered. Lloyd&#x27;s of London paid out for the losses, and several shooting deaths have been linked to the case.

==Robbery==

The Brink&#x27;s-Mat robbery happened at 06:40 on 26 November 1983 when six robbers broke into the Brink&#x27;s-Mat warehouse, Unit 7 of the Heathrow International Trading Estate near Heathrow Airport in West London, England. It was described as &quot;the crime of the century&quot;.

The gang gained entry to the warehouse from security guard Anthony Black, who was complicit in the robbery. Once inside, they poured petrol over the staff and threatened them with a lit match if they did not reveal the combination numbers of the vault. The robbers thought that they were going to steal around £1 million worth of Spanish pesetas, but they also found three tonnes (3000 kg) of pure gold bullion outside the main vault in 152 bars in 76 cardboard boxes. The gold had been stored at the warehouse overnight before being due to be transferred to Hong Kong the next day. In addition, they stole platinum, 1,000 carats of diamonds and $250,000 of traveller&#x27;s cheques. The total value of their haul was £26 million (equivalent to £ in ).

==Arrests==
Two days after the robbery, a couple saw a white-hot crucible operating in a garden hut at a neighbour&#x27;s property near Bath, Somerset. Suspecting it to be linked to the bullion robbery, they immediately informed the police. The police arrived and were shown the hut, but they said it was just beyond their jurisdiction and stated that they would pass the information on to the police responsible for that area. The couple were never asked to give a statement to police nor give evidence in court. No explanation has been given for the police&#x27;s failure to follow up immediately on the tip-off.

Police soon identified that Black&#x27;s sister was living with Brian Robinson, who appeared in Flying Squad intelligence files. Black confessed in December 1983 to aiding and abetting the raiders, providing them with impressions of the key to the main door, and giving them details of security measures and became an informer. He identified his brother-in-law, Brian Robinson, as one of the robbers. Ten days after the robbery, Robinson and Micky McAvoy were arrested. Anthony Black was also arrested for the robbery but was later acquitted.

In January 1985, the premises in Bath were raided and the furnace was found but the occupier, John Palmer, a jeweller and bullion dealer, was on holiday in Tenerife. His former partners Garth Chappell and Terrence Patch were arrested. The sudden movement of £13 million through Bristol area branches of Barclays Bank allegedly came to the notice of the Bank of England, which informed the police although the Bank of England denied this.

McAvoy had entrusted part of his share to associates Brian Perry and George Francis. Perry recruited Kenneth Noye, who was an expert in his field, to dispose of the gold. Noye melted down the bullion and recast it for sale, mixing in copper coins to disguise the source.

Noye was placed under police surveillance. In January 1985, he encountered undercover Detective Constable John Fordham, dressed in camouflage and a balaclava, in the grounds of his home and stabbed him 10 times, resulting in the detective&#x27;s death. Noye claimed that he had been attacked and killed Fordham in self-defence and at the resulting trial, the jury found him not guilty of murder. Brian Reader was also at the property at the time and put on trial for murder but was acquitted.

In 1986, seven men, including Noye, Reader, Chappell and Patch, were put on trial for handling the stolen gold, with Noye accused of masterminding and controlling the operation to launder the robbery proceeds.

Palmer was deported to Britain from Brazil in 1986 and was put on trial in 1987. In court, Palmer said he was unaware the gold was linked to the robbery and he was cleared of all charges.

Another suspect, John Fleming, was held in Miami in 1986 after being deported from Costa Rica where he had arrived following an earlier ejection from Spain. He was subsequently deported from the US to the UK in 1987 and charged with handling £840,000. Despite the three year attempt to question him, his case was thrown out of court after just 25 seconds due to insufficient evidence.

In 1988, nine people, including Perry, solicitor Michael Relton and McAvoy&#x27;s wife Kathleen, were arrested and put on trial for conspiracy to handle stolen goods. Relton was accused of bringing £7.5 million smuggled to Switzerland and Liechtenstein back to the UK to invest in London&#x27;s property boom in the Docklands. A tenth person, property developer Gordon Parry, was also considered a co-conspirator but initially escaped arrest. The jury failed to reach a verdict for Perry who faced a retrial.

Parry was arrested in Fuengirola, Spain, in 1989 and returned to the UK a year later and charged with handling over £16 million. He went on trial with, among others, Perry, McAvoy&#x27;s first wife Jacqueline, Patrick Clark, and Jean Savage in 1991. Perry was accused of laundering £7.5 million, Clark and his son £4.5 million and Savage £2.5 million. McAvoy&#x27;s former wife was alleged to have benefitted from a house her ex-husband bought her. The jury failed to reach a verdict for McAvoy but her house was seized.

Black was sentenced to six years for robbery.

; Gordon Parry, Brian Perry, Patrick Clark, and Jean Savage
In August 1992, Gordon Parry, Brian Perry,&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/2001/11/25/ukcrime&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Clark, and Jean Savage were convicted at the Old Bailey. Parry was jailed for ten years, Perry for nine years, Clark for six and Savage for five years.

A few months after leaving prison in 2001, Perry was shot dead.

==Recovery==
===Gold===
Attempts by McAvoy to strike a deal to give back his share of the money in exchange for a reduced sentence failed, as by then the money had vanished. Despite a record reward of £2 million offered for locating the gold, much of the three tonnes of stolen gold has never been recovered. £1 million of gold was found stored at the Bank of England. In 1996, about half of the gold, the portion which had been smelted and recast, was thought to have found its way back into the legitimate gold market, including the reserves of the true owners, Johnson Matthey. According to the BBC, some have claimed that anyone wearing gold jewellery bought in the UK after 1983 is probably wearing Brink&#x27;s-Mat. The rest of the gold was believed to have been buried.

Lloyd&#x27;s of London made a record insurance pay out of £26 million.

===Cash and other assets===
By 1995, 57 people had assets frozen, including homes and a Kansas oil well and the insurers had recovered £16 million, including £3 million from Noye. In January 1995, the High Court ordered McAvoy to make a payment of £27,488,299, making him responsible for the entire sum stolen. Despite being acquitted of robbery, in 1995 White was also ordered by the High Court to repay the stolen £26 million plus £2.2 million in compensation and his wife ordered to repay £1.1 million. The judge said that he was satisfied that White was involved in planning the robbery. By 2004, £25 million had been recovered in total.

===Counterfeit stolen gold bars===
On 21 December 1983, less than four weeks after the robbery, police in Austria arrested five men, four Italians and an Austrian, at a Vienna hotel. Police also recovered ten bullion bars bearing the refiner&#x27;s mark and serial numbers of bars stolen in the Brink&#x27;s-Mat robbery.

According to the police spokesman, the bars were gold-coated tungsten counterfeits, and therefore could not be Johnson Matthey&#x27;s stolen gold bars. He said that the arrested men planned to fraudulently claim they were from the Heathrow robbery. No explanation was given as to how the counterfeiters obtained the unpublished bar serial numbers, nor the likely benefit of counterfeiting stolen property in this way.

===Panama Papers===
Gordon Parry laundered large amounts of cash from the robbery after the disposal of the gold according to the Panama Papers, which show an offshore financial intermediary firm in Jersey named Centre Services requested Mossack Fonseca set up a Panamanian company 12 months after the Heathrow raid on behalf of an unnamed client. Under Parry&#x27;s direction millions of pounds were put through the resulting Feberion and other front companies via banks in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Jersey and the Isle of Man. A man identified as depositing £800,000 in cash to the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank is thought to have been notorious armed robber David Moore.

Two nominee directors from Sark were appointed to Feberion and the company then issued two bearer shares. Parry used the offshore firms and recycled the funds, said to have amounted to £10.7 million, through transactions involving land in London Docklands, some buildings that used to form part of Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College, a farmhouse in Kent for McAvoy&#x27;s girlfriend Kathleen Meacock and a £400,000 home for himself and his family, Crockham House, near Chartwell, Kent. The Metropolitan Police raided the offices of Centre Services in late 1986 in cooperation with the Jersey authorities, seized papers and the two Feberion bearer shares.

In 1987, Jürgen Mossack, the law firm&#x27;s principal, regained control of the company by dilution. Parry appointed a fresh set of Feberion directors, who were instructed to issue 98 new shares to Western Cross Inc, a front company controlled by Parry or his associates. In 1995, Brink&#x27;s-Mat solicitors finally took control of Feberion and its assets. Crockham House was sold, and reacquired by Parry&#x27;s wife, Irene Beaumont.

==Collapse of Johnson Matthey Bankers Ltd==
On 30 September 1984, less than a year after the Brink&#x27;s-Mat robbery, the banking and gold-trading arm of Johnson Matthey (Johnson Matthey Bankers Ltd) collapsed and was taken over by the Bank of England to protect the integrity of the London gold markets. Losses amounted to over US$300 million. The bank had made very large loans to fraudsters and insolvent businesses over several years, and had serious and unexplained gaps in its records. The fraud squad was called in to investigate the bank and certain customers.

==&quot;Curse&quot;==
The so-called &quot;Curse of Brink&#x27;s-Mat&quot; or &quot;Curse of the Brink&#x27;s-Mat millions&quot; refers to the shooting deaths of several men who were allegedly involved.
These deaths were thought by members of the London criminal underworld to be related to laundering of the gold.
* In 1990, the former treasurer of the Great Train Robbery, Charlie Wilson, had moved to Marbella, Spain, where he was suspected of being involved in drug smuggling. Engaged to launder some of the proceeds from the Brink&#x27;s-Mat robbery, he lost the investors&#x27; £3 million. On 23 April 1990 Wilson was shot dead.
* Nick Whiting, an old schoolfriend of Noye who was questioned on laundering, was found dead after being shot twice and stabbed in 1990.
* Donald Urquhart was one of the launderers of the proceeds of the robbery; he was shot dead in January 1993 on Marylebone High Street in Central London. The supergrass Kenneth Regan assisted police with information about Urquhart&#x27;s murder. Graeme West was subsequently jailed for Urquhart&#x27;s killing, as was his accomplice Geoffrey Heath, who planned the murder.
* In 1996, Keith Hedley, a suspected money launderer whose home was searched during the investigation, was shot dead on his yacht in the Mediterranean Sea.
* On 5 December 1998, Hatton Garden jeweller Solly Nahome was shot dead outside his home. Nahome was a &quot;financer&quot; and associate of the Adams family, who were also suspected of having been involved in the laundering of the Brink&#x27;s-Mat gold. Prior to his murder, Nahome&#x27;s associate and jeweller Gilbert Wynter had disappeared from the home that he shared with his girlfriend on 9 March 1998. It was thought that Nahome and Wynter were murdered over the disappearance of £800,000 from a cannabis deal, while it was suspected that a rival gang murdered Nahome and Wynter to cause disruption.
* In November 2001, Brian Perry was shot three times in the head in Deptford.
* On 14 May 2003, George Francis was shot dead by John O&#x27;Flynn outside Francis&#x27; courier business in Bermondsey. Francis was a former associate of the Krays and was believed to have been involved in the laundering of the gold. Francis had survived an attempt on his life when he was shot in the shoulder over the bar in the Henry VIII Inn in Hever which he ran in May 1985, after allegedly failing to pay £100,000 to have a jury acquit Lennie &quot;Teddy Bear&quot; Watkins, who was on trial for the murder of Peter Bennett, a customs investigator who was shot by Watkins in a struggle.
* On 24 June 2015, John &quot;Goldfinger&quot; Palmer was shot dead.

==In popular culture==

* On 14 November 1992, a made-for-television film called &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot; based on the robbery was aired on ITV with McAvoy portrayed by Sean Bean.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia/fools-gold&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1994, Roger Cook exposed John Palmer for his part in the robbery during an edition of The Cook Report entitled &quot;The Laundry Man&quot;.
* On 24 November and 1 December 2003, Channel 4 broadcast &quot;Brinks Mat: The Greatest Heist&quot;, two-part documentary of the raid in its &quot;Secret History&quot; strand.&lt;ref name=&quot;thefreelibrary/a0110468984&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, Will Pearson published the book &quot;Death Warrant: Kenneth Noye, the Brink&#x27;s-Mat Robbery And The Gold&quot; that provides a captivating account of the heist, chase and convictions as well as personal tragedies and ironies of the events.
* In 2010, a documentary was broadcast on the Crime+Investigation UK network.
* &lt;ref name=&quot;thefreelibrary/a0289390205&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 4 February 2017 Channel 5 aired a documentary updating events, including the death of John Palmer. In the new documentary first-hand accounts from the security guards were given who were on shift the morning of the robbery as well as from officers on the case.
* On 1 April 2017 BBC Radio 4 aired a drama, &quot;The Hatton Garden Heist&quot;, which included the events of the Brink&#x27;s-Mat robbery.
* In 2022, Channel 4 aired &quot;The Curse&quot;, written by the producers and writers of the TV series, &quot;People Just Do Nothing&quot;, fictionalising aspects of the Brink&#x27;s-Mat robbery.
* In 2023, Channel 5 aired a documentary, including first-hand accounts from the security guards who were on shift the morning of the robbery as well as from officers on the case.
* On 1 February 2023, BBC Radio 5 Live began airing a 6-part documentary and podcast, as part of its &quot;Gangster&quot; series, about John Palmer and the events that surrounded the robbery.
* On 12 February 2023, BBC One began airing a six-episode drama called &quot;The Gold&quot; inspired by the robbery, starring Charlotte Spencer, Dominic Cooper, Hugh Bonneville and Jack Lowden. In November 2023, the BBC announced that the drama would return for a second series. In 2023, Ebury published &quot;The Gold: The Real Story Behind Brink’s-Mat: Britain’s Biggest Heist&quot;, to accompany the series. The book was written by the creator of &quot;The Gold&quot;, Neil Forsyth, along with the show’s researcher Thomas Turner.
* The BBC also released a documentary about the robbery following the drama series entitled &quot;The Gold: The Inside Story&quot; in March 2023.

<doc id="1031691" wikidata="Q352064" url="?curid=1031691" title="Yi Jianlian">
<text>Yi Jianlian ( ; born October 27, 1984) is a Chinese former professional basketball player who last played for the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). He also played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks, the New Jersey Nets, the Washington Wizards, and the Dallas Mavericks.

Yi joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 2002–03 CBA season, and subsequently won the CBA Rookie of the Year award. In his first five years with Guangdong, the team won three CBA titles. In the 2007 NBA draft, he was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick. Yi declined to sign with Milwaukee for several months but agreed to a contract in August 2007. He later played for three other NBA teams, then returned to the Guangdong Southern Tigers in 2012.

Yi also played for the Chinese national team in the 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympics and the 2006 and 2010 FIBA World Championships.

== Early life ==
As a child, Yi&#x27;s parents did not allow him to join a sports school, which is designed for children predicted to be future professional athletes. However, a sports school&#x27;s basketball coach who saw him playing street basketball persuaded his family to allow him to train professionally. Hoping to sign Yi to an endorsement deal, Adidas invited him to attend the company&#x27;s ABCD Camp in New Jersey in 2002, where he competed against all-American high school players.

=== Age controversy ===
In 2004, Yi was listed as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese officials said that it was probably a typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of &quot;The Houston Chronicle&quot; reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age.

In 2007 and 2008, Yi&#x27;s date of birth was further scrutinized as being October 27, 1984, including a Chinese reporter discovering a high school enrollment form from 1997 that listed Yi as being born on October 27, 1984.

== Professional career ==
=== Guangdong Southern Tigers (2002–2007) ===
After returning to China in 2002, Yi signed a professional contract with Chinese Basketball Association side Guangdong Southern Tigers and averaged 3.5 points and 1.9 rebounds per game in his first season. He also averaged 7.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in four games during the playoffs, and won the Rookie of the Year award. Yi was featured in &quot;Time&quot;″s August 2003 article titled &quot;The Next Yao Ming&quot;. In each of his next three seasons, Yi led Guangdong to the CBA championship and he was awarded the CBA Finals Most Valuable Player honor in 2006. In Yi&#x27;s final season in the Chinese Basketball Association before he entered the 2007 NBA draft, he averaged a career-high 24.9 points and 11.5 rebounds per game, but his team lost to the Bayi Rockets in the playoff finals.

=== Milwaukee Bucks (2007–2008) ===
Yi was not expected to enter the NBA draft until 2009 because the Chinese Basketball Association ruled that players are not allowed to leave for foreign leagues until they turned 22. In early 2006, however, Yi announced that he would enter the 2006 NBA draft although he eventually decided to withdraw, saying he was &quot;not good enough to compete in the NBA and needed more experience.&quot; Later that year, the Guangdong Southern Tigers announced that Yi would enter the 2007 NBA draft.

Yi chose Dan Fegan as his agent to represent him in the NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted by many to be picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On June 28, 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them to be one of the teams invited to Yi&#x27;s pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian-American community. However, Milwaukee&#x27;s general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese-born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016.

After the draft, Milwaukee attempted to convince Yi to sign with the team and on July 2, 2007, the owner of the Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee; however, Yi&#x27;s representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On August 29, 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract.
Yi was named to Milwaukee&#x27;s starting lineup by head coach Larry Krystkowiak in place of Charlie Villanueva to begin the 2007–08 season. He recorded nine points and three rebounds in a debut loss to the Orlando Magic. He played his first home game in Milwaukee three days later and scored 16 points while grabbing eight rebounds in a 78–72 win over the Chicago Bulls. The game was also Yi&#x27;s first game to be televised nationally in China, where it was watched by an estimated 100 million viewers. Yao Ming praised Yi&#x27;s play in his first few games, saying, &quot;If you compare us in our third NBA games, you will see that Yi&#x27;s statistics are far better than mine.&quot;

On November 9, 2007, Yi played against Yao Ming for the first time when the Houston Rockets hosted Milwaukee in a 104–88 loss. Yi recorded 19 points and nine rebounds, including two three-pointers, while Yao recorded 28 points and nine rebounds. The game between the two was watched by over 200 million people in China, making it one of the most-watched games in NBA history. After the game, Yao called Yi&#x27;s talent &quot;unbelievable&quot; and Tracy McGrady said that Yi had a &quot;tremendous upside in this league&quot;. Del Harris, the former head coach of the Chinese national basketball team, also described Yi as the &quot;most athletic seven-footer in the NBA.&quot;

Yi was named the NBA Rookie of the Month for December 2007 after averaging 12.1 points and 6.6 rebounds per game that month, while scoring a career-high 29 points on 14-of-17 shooting in a win over the Charlotte Bobcats on December 22. On January 30, 2008, he was selected for the rookie team in the Rookie Challenge at the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. On February 2, 2008, Yi faced Yao for the second time when Milwaukee played at home against Houston, which Krystkowiak dubbed the &quot;Chinese Super Bowl.&quot; However, both players struggled during Houston&#x27;s 91–83 victory over Milwaukee. Yao scored 12 points while Yi injured his shoulder during the game, finishing with just six points.

On April 2, 2008, it was announced that Yi would miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. Having already missed eight games with other injuries, Yi managed 66 out of a possible 82 games in his rookie season, averaging 8.6 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. One of Milwaukee&#x27;s assistant coaches, Brian James, later said that &quot;the injuries he had bothered him more than people realized, and he couldn&#x27;t play through them.&quot;

=== New Jersey Nets (2008–2010) ===

On June 26, 2008, Yi was traded by the Milwaukee Bucks along with Bobby Simmons to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Richard Jefferson. New Jersey&#x27;s team president Rod Thorn said that &quot;we feel strongly he&#x27;s going to be a real good player,&quot; and the team&#x27;s chief executive Brett Yormark said &quot;it opens up a truly new fan base for us.&quot; Yi stated that he didn&#x27;t expect to be traded, but that it was &quot;an honor to join the Nets.&quot;

Through his first 37 games with New Jersey, Yi averaged 10.5 points and 6.2 rebounds per game while shooting 39% from behind the three-point line, which was well above his average from the previous season. But on January 9, 2009, Yi broke the pinkie on his right hand and was expected to miss four to six weeks. Thorn called it &quot;lousy timing&quot; because &quot;he&#x27;d been playing well,&quot; but Yi said &quot;(I&#x27;ll) just take my time. I&#x27;ll come back.&quot; In voting for the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, Yi finished third in total votes for forwards in the Eastern Conference, ahead of players such as Paul Pierce and Chris Bosh.

Yi made his return from injury after the 2009 NBA All-Star Game in a loss to the Houston Rockets on February 17, 2009. However, after averaging only six points on 36% shooting after his return, Yi was removed from the team&#x27;s starting lineup. His final averages for the season were 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, as well as a 38% shooting accuracy from the field and 34% on three-point field goals. After New Jersey finished the season outside of the playoffs, Yi&#x27;s agent Dan Fegan suggested New Jersey played better when Yi played more minutes and took more shots, and asks &quot;who&#x27;s accountable?&quot; New Jersey&#x27;s head coach Lawrence Frank said that &quot;you have to be patient. He&#x27;s only 21&quot;, and Yi assessed his season by saying he was &quot;still too much up and down.&quot;

In the 2009–10 season, Yi returned to the starting lineup for New Jersey. Starting in every game he played but one, Yi suffered several injuries during the season which made him miss 30 games. He sprained his medial collateral ligament on November 4, 2009, had a laceration on his upper lip on December 8, 2009, and sprained his left ankle on 8 March 2010. His final averages for the season were 12 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, as well as 40% shooting accuracy from the field and 37% on three-point field goals.

=== Washington Wizards (2010–2011) ===

On June 29, 2010, Yi was traded to the Washington Wizards along with $3 million in cash considerations for Quinton Ross. Yi ended the 2010–11 season averaging 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. Washington had until June 30, 2011, to extend Yi&#x27;s contract but decided not to do so.

=== Return to the Tigers (2011) ===
During the 2011 NBA lockout, Yi signed a one-year contract to return to the Guangdong Southern Tigers. Unlike most NBA players who went to the Chinese Basketball Association during that time, he received an option to return to the NBA once the lockout had been resolved.

=== Dallas Mavericks (2012) ===
On January 6, 2012, Yi signed with the Dallas Mavericks to a one-year contract after starting the season with the Guangdong Southern Tigers. He was immediately assigned to Dallas&#x27; D-League affiliate team, the Texas Legends. Yi benefited from the new collective bargaining agreement rules which allowed players with more than two years of NBA experience to be assigned to the D-League with the players&#x27; consent. On January 9, 2012, after playing two games for the Texas Legends, averaging 23 points and 12 rebounds per game, he was recalled by Dallas. The team faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the playoffs and in game 3 of the playoff series, Yi played in his first NBA playoffs game, where he scored two points for the team in five minutes.

=== Third stint in Guangdong (2012–2023) ===
Yi re-joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 2012–13 CBA season and went on to win a fourth championship that season.

On August 22, 2016, Yi signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, returning to the NBA for the first time since 2012. Lakers head coach Luke Walton considered Yi to be the team&#x27;s best-shooting big man during the preseason, but did not provide Yi with much of a role. Yi averaged 3.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in 10.7 minutes per game over six contests with the Lakers during the preseason. Feeling he would have better opportunities elsewhere, Yi requested a release from the Lakers prior to the start of the regular season. The Lakers waived him on October 24, 2016.

In October 2016, Yi returned to Guangdong after spending training camp with the Los Angeles Lakers.

On August 15, 2020, Yi helped the Guangdong Southern Tigers in winning their 10th CBA championship after a 123–115 win in game 3 of the CBA Finals over the Liaoning Flying Leopards, but Yi had suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon during the game and was expected to miss a major part of 2020–21 CBA season due to rehabilitation.

The 2022–23 CBA season was Yi&#x27;s final basketball season where he made the decision to retire on August 30, 2023. He wrote on Sina Weibo: &quot;Time flies; in the blink of an eye, basketball has been by my side for 21 years. After much contemplation, I have made the decision to officially bring my basketball career to a close. I will cherish the memories of the past while continuing to move forward, embracing new chapters in my life. Goodbye, my beloved basketball.&quot;

== National team career ==

Yi&#x27;s first major international experience came at the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which he averaged 18.9 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. He made his debut with the Chinese national basketball team during the 2004 Summer Olympics and averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds per game at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. His performance impressed coaches on the Chinese national team as well as the coaches from other countries.

In 2008, Yi was once again selected to play for the Chinese national team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In China&#x27;s first two group stage matches, Yi scored 9 and 4 points, respectively, and China lost both their games against the United States and Spain. But in a win against Angola, Yi recorded a double-double, and in a win against Germany, Yi recorded 9 points and 11 rebounds, and hit the crucial shot with 28 seconds left to help China advance to the quarter-finals. However, Lithuania ended China&#x27;s run by beating them 94–68, as Yi scored 11 points for his side.

Yi, along with former NBA player Sun Yue, was a member of the Chinese national team that played at the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship and the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. Yi was named the most valuable player of the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship, averaging 16.6 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. Yi also played for the Chinese national team during the 2012 Summer Olympics, ranking first in rebounds per game with 10.2 per game and ranking second in blocks with 2.2 per game. He also played at the 2016 Summer Olympics. During 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Yi was still the leader on the Chinese national team, averaging 17.8 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.2 assists. In the match with Nigeria, he displayed the best performance for the national team in recent years. Yi got 27 points and a player efficiency of 26.

== Personal life ==
Yi is fluent in both Mandarin and his native tongue of Cantonese. He was ranked fourth on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ China Celebrity 100 in income and popularity in 2008. In 2008, Yi donated 100,000 yuan to support the 2008 Sichuan earthquake victims and also participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics&#x27; torch relay by carrying the torch during the Hainan leg of the relay.

In October 2024, Yi Jianlian embroiled in a sex scandal involving the solicitation of a transgender woman, purportedly paying her US$1,500. A staff member from the Dongguan Municipal CPPCC confirmed they were aware of the scandal but could not verify its authenticity. Several brands that had previously collaborated with Yi swiftly removed promotional materials related to him, and Yi has not made any public response to the accusations.

<doc id="1031692" wikidata="Q607097" url="?curid=1031692" title="West Gate Freeway">
<text>The West Gate Freeway is a major freeway in Melbourne, the busiest urban freeway and the busiest road in Australia, carrying upwards of 200,000 vehicles per day. It links Geelong (via the Princes Freeway) and Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs to central Melbourne and beyond. It is also a link between Melbourne and the west and linking industrial and residential areas west of the Yarra River with the city and port areas. The West Gate Bridge is a part of the freeway.

It is a fully managed freeway with a complete &#x27;Freeway Management System&#x27; that is dynamically linked and adaptive to the entire M1 corridor. This includes the 2008 re-design of a substantial section. Overall, the freeway has between 4-6 lanes in each direction, with a maximum of 12 lanes at one point in its width.

==Route==
The West Gate Freeway officially begins at the West Gate Interchange in Laverton North, with ramps to and from the Western Ring Road, Princes Freeway and Princes Highway (Geelong Road) and heads east as an eight-lane dual-carriageway, crossing the Yarra River over the West Gate bridge, through Port Melbourne, and then becomes elevated for its remaining length, with access ramps to Melbourne&#x27;s central business district. Eastward beyond the Kings Way and Power Street exits is the CityLink&#x27;s Southern Link, connecting onwards through Melbourne&#x27;s south-eastern suburbs through the Burnley and Domain Tunnels.

Standard travel time on the West Gate Freeway in both directions, is 12 minutes: 5 minutes between the Western Ring Road and Williamstown Road, and 7 minutes between Williamstown Road and Kings Way.

The usual peak period travel time, is between 16–27 minutes; however, in times of extreme congestion or traffic accidents, the travel time can well exceed 40 minutes.

==History==
The Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) was authorised by the government in December 1961 for a study to gather engineering and economic data for the provisioning of a toll crossing of the Lower Yarra River, from Salmon Street in Port Melbourne to the Princes Highway in the vicinity of Kororoit Creek, a distance of 5.25 miles. Investigations included details of bores down to 8,000 feet and soil tests (completed on 29 June 1962), selective drilling and sampling in critical areas, and traffic studies, and at the time both a tunnel under and a bridge over the river were mooted. In February 1966, the Board was appointed as the design and construction authority for the Lower Yarra Crossing Project; the State government authorised the construction of a tolled bridge over the Yarra with eight lanes.

Construction began on the first section of the Lower Yarra Freeway in the late 1960s and was open to traffic by 1971, stretching from the Princes Highway just south of the intersection with Little Boundary Road in Laverton North (later enlarged and named the West Gate Interchange) eastwards to Melbourne/Williamstown Roads just west of the mouth of the Yarra. At the time, the only way to cross the Yarra west of the CBD was via a ferry crossing (the Yarra River punt service), which naturally saw far heavier demands once the Lower Yarra Freeway was officially opened.

The West Gate Bridge across the Yarra had started construction not too long before the opening of the freeway and, although delayed, when finally completed in 1978 allowed the freeway to extend over the river and directly into the CBD&#x27;s south-western corner (via Rogers and Lorimer Streets). The freeway&#x27;s name was changed to the West Gate Freeway to commemorate its opening, but the freeway also attracted tolls from anyone using the bridge (between Melbourne/Williamstown Road and Rogers Street) between 16 November 1978 and 17 November 1985. The toll plaza was located on the city side of the bridge where the service stations are now located. National Route 1 – previously designated along Geelong Road (Princes Highway West) and through the CBD via Smithfield and Flemington Roads and King Street – was altered to use the freeway instead and rejoin Kings Way via Rogers, Lorimer and Clarendon Streets. As a result of the diverted traffic over the West Gate Bridge, the Yarra River punt service closed in 1979.

Due to the extra traffic the West Gate Freeway was attracting—and due to the safety concerns of having excess traffic filter through connector streets in South Melbourne—the freeway was first extended to Johnson Street (today Montague Street) in 1985, and then finally to Kings Way above the Grant Street intersection using elevated carriageways; the eastbound carriageway opened in 1987, and the westbound carriageway opened nearly a year later in 1988. Expansion of the original two lane freeway on the western side of the bridge to three lanes each way was carried out in 1991, and expansion to four lanes followed in 2000. With the subsequent completion of the Western Ring Road joining the West Gate Interchange to the freeway&#x27;s west and CityLink to the freeway&#x27;s east, it also funnels traffic from northern and western suburbs around Melbourne, acting as a bypass freeway.

The Lower Yarra Freeway was signed Freeway Route 82 upon opening in 1971, joined by National Route 1 when the West Gate Bridge opened in 1978, and both were extended onto new sections of the West Gate Freeway as they opened during the 1980s; Freeway Route 82 was eventually removed in 1988. Tourist Route 2 also runs along the freeway from the Melbourne/Williamstown Road interchange in Spotswood and the Montague Street interchange in Port Melbourne. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, the freeway&#x27;s National Route 1 designation began conversion to M1 in late 1996, and was completed in 1997.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2007, VicRoads re-declared this road as West Gate Freeway (Freeway #1820), from the Princes Freeway at Laverton North and ending at the ramps to Kings Way and Power Street in Southbank.

The original Lower Yarra Freeway was officially designated in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as the F9 Freeway corridor. 

===Timeline of construction===
*1971 – Lower Yarra Freeway, initial opened from Princes Highway to Williamstown Road on 7 April 1971, originally 3 lanes in each direction, at a cost of $14 million.
*1978 – West Gate Bridge, opened 15 November 1978, by the Premier, the Hon. R J Hamer ED, MP; with freeway extension from the bridge to Rogers Street
*1985 – Tolls removed from West Gate Bridge, 17 November 1985
*1985 – Extended 1.5km from Rogers Street to Johnson Street, opened December 1985
*1987 – Extended 2.1km from Johnson Street to Kings Way, single carriageway eastbound, opened December 1987
*1988 – Extended 2.1km from Johnson Street to Kings Way, single carriageway westbound, opened October 1988; total cost for both carriageways to Kings Way/Power Street $185 million
*1991 – Widening to three lanes in both directions between Princes Highway and Millers Road. (this possibly conflicts with information given in CRB&#x27;s 58th Annual Report, which states the freeway opened with three lanes in each direction in 1971, whilst omitting that the third lane only existed between Millers Road and Williamstown Road).
*2000 – Widening to four lanes in both directions between the West Gate Bridge and Laverton.

===2008–11 upgrade===
Traffic volumes on the West Gate Freeway have grown steadily since opening, carrying up to 180,000 vehicles every day. Congestion frequently occurs at the Montague Street and Bolte Bridge interchanges due to conflicting traffic movements on and off the freeway. On 1 May 2008 the Minister for Roads and Ports Tim Pallas announced design details for the West Gate Freeway improvements, to assist in maintaining rapidly growing volume capacity and to reduce congestion.

They are:
* a full freeway management system, made up of Ramp Metering (Signalling), Lane Use Management Signs (overhead lane availability / variable speed zones), electronic on-road message signs, arterial road message signs, CCTV cameras and a suite of freeway traffic algorithms and software with data stations, thousands of sensors and a core server at the VicRoads TMC. Previously wind warning lights were used to reduce the speed limit during high winds but it could only limit speed to either 40 km/h or 60 km/h.
* the addition of a new elevated road structure joining the outbound Kings Way on-ramp to the Freeway
* new traffic ramps over Montague Street
* an additional dedicated exit ramp from the Bolte Bridge to the Freeway
* widening of the freeway between Todd Road and Montague Street
* redesign of the Montague Street interchange.

These works help reduce merging and weaving movements at key points on the freeway, leading to a smoother traffic flow and improved driver safety. As part of the works the Montague Street on-ramp city bound had been closed for approximately 18 months to enable the new one to be built.

Early works on the West Gate Freeway, including geo-technical investigations and service proving, commenced in late 2007. In early 2008 construction works started on the freeway widening, specifically in the South Melbourne area. New traffic lanes and ramps have been completed and opened in different stages with the total project eventually completed and opened to traffic in June 2011. The project was awarded the 2011 Australian Construction Achievement Award.

==Exits and interchanges==






===Freeway map===
==Future tolls==
When West Gate Tunnel opens to traffic in 2025, heavy commercial vehicles will be tolled on the section of the West Gate Freeway between Millers Road and Hyde Street. These tolls also automatically cover the use of West Gate Tunnel and its connector roads to the city, or the new Hyde Street on and off-road ramps, without incurring additional tolls. The freeway tolls will still be charged to heavy vehicles not using tunnel or Hyde Street ramps, such as entering or exiting at Williamstown Road or using the West Gate Bridge.

Other vehicles will not be tolled on the West Gate Freeway unless accessing the West Gate Tunnel or Hyde Street ramps.

<doc id="1031694" wikidata="Q7368453" url="?curid=1031694" title="Rosemberg Pabón">
<text>Rosemberg Pabón Pabón (born January 1, 1947) is a Colombian political scientist who served as the Director of the National Administrative Department of Solidary Economy (&quot;DanSocial&quot;). A former leader of the M-19 guerrilla movement, he commanded the 1980 Dominican Embassy siege in Bogotá. After the Government reached a peace deal with the M-19, Pabón returned to the country, re-entered society and entered politics, first as a Delegate to the National Constituent Assembly in 1991, then as Mayor of Yumbo from 1998 to 2000, and as Senator for Congress in 2003 and 2004.

==Involvement with the M-19==

===Siege of the Dominican Embassy===
===Exile in Cuba and demobilization===
Pabón lived in exile in Cuba, after the siege, remaining a member of the M-19. He returned to Colombia in 1984, and participated in the siege of the city of Yumbo. He returned to civilian life after M-19 signed a peace treaty with the Colombian government in March 1990.

==Political career==

===Mayor of Yumbo===
In 1997, Pabón successfully ran for Mayor of the Municipality of Yumbo as a M-19 candidate for the 1998-2000 period. His first concern as Mayor was to dissipate the public sector strike that had taken place under the administration of the previous mayor Carlos Alberto Moreno Herrera.

In 2000, Rosemberg resigned as Mayor of Yumbo to stand for as a candidate in the nearby elections for Mayor of Santiago de Cali. He temporarily stepped down leaving Abraham Rubio Quiroga as interim Mayor of Yumbo before the next elections, and was finally replaced by Alba Leticia Chávez Jiménez. His run for Mayor of Cali, however, proved unsuccessful, losing to John Maro Rodríguez Flórez.

His administration was criticized for misuse of the public coffers, leaving a COP$5,200 million of deficit and impeding the pay of thousands of public sector employees.

===Senator===
In 2002, Pabón ran for the Senate of Colombia as third in line from the Alternative Way Senate list of Antonio Navarro Wolff, another former M-19 member, however Navarro&#x27;s list only managed to get enough votes for two seats. In 2004, Pabón replaced Navarro in the Senate from July 20 to November 1, an opportunity that repeated itself again from July 22 to October 22, 2003 when he replaced Gerardo Antonio Jumi Tapias.

During his time as Senator, Pabón voted in favor of proposed legislation that would have legalized recognition of same-sex unions in Colombia, however the proposed law that had the backing of prominent liberal senators like Piedad Córdoba could not amount the necessary votes to pass.

In 2005, Pabón left the Independent Democratic Pole, a left leaning coalition party which he himself had help found, among other reasons, Pabón was a strong supporter of the conservative leaning President Álvaro Uribe Vélez and believed that the Pole was taking &quot;&quot;leftist radicalism of the maoist and procuban era&quot;.&quot; In 2006, Pabón once again ran for Senate this time trying to align himself more to the centre-right by joining the ranks of the political party Citizens&#x27; Convergence, this time around however proved more unsuccessful than before as Pabón was not able to get enough conservative votes and alienated his strong liberal base.

===Director of DanSocial===
On August 1, 2006, President Uribe named Pabón to head the National Administrative Department of Solidarity Economy, also known as &quot;DanSocial&quot;., the state agency in charge of formulating and developing policy on matters of solidarity economy. The agency was dissolved November 2, 2011.

==History==
The 222nd Broadcast Operations Detachment, a United States Army Reserve unit, from Los Angeles, California took control of AFN Radio &amp; Television in August 2003.
The 222nd Broadcast Operations Detachment was relieved by the 209th Broadcast Operations Detachment (USAR) from Rome, Georgia, in August 2004.
In August 2005 the 206th Broadcast Operations Detachment (USAR), from Dallas, Texas relieved the 209th Broadcast Operations Detachment.
In August 2006 the 356th Operations Detachment (USAR), from Ft. Meade, Maryland, relieved the 206th Broadcast Operations Detachment. 
In August 2007, the US Air Force assumed control of AFN Iraq until February 2009.
In March 2009, the 222nd Broadcast Operations Detachment (USAR), from Los Angeles, Calif. assumed control of the station. In March 2010, the 209th Broadcast Operations Detachment (USAR) from Rome, Georgia again assumed command of AFN-I.
2004- T-shirts sold through area AAFES outlets, depicted CH46 helicopters flying over a herd of camels, on a dark blue heavy weight 100% cotton T. &quot;More &#x27;Raq, less Taq&quot; was the wording. A very popular item at the time.

==Television==
&quot;Freedom Journal Iraq&quot; was produced by the electronic news gathering (ENG) team of the American Forces Network-Iraq, five times a week until 2009. The 10-minute newscast was produced Monday through Friday and uploaded via satellite to the Pentagon Channel in Washington D.C. Originally, the program was produced weekly.

The newscast was awarded 1st and 2nd place Keith L. Ware Broadcast Journalism Awards in 2005 for best Army Television Newscast while being produced by the 206th Broadcast Operations Detachment.

Broadcast journalists have traveled the entire theater of operations in support of &quot;Freedom Journal Iraq&quot;, from Kuwait to Turkey. Although not designated combat camera correspondents, a few broadcast journalists have been awarded the Combat Action Badge for their duty serving at American Forces Network-Iraq.

Freestyle Iraq is produced by AFN-Iraq. Created by members of the 222nd BOD, Freestyle Iraq is a production that highlights service members in their &quot;off&quot; time. The show won 2nd place in the 2010 Keith L. Ware awards.

The 206th BOD resumed control of AFN Iraq in December 2010. The 206th was the last unit to man the TV-radio station. September 30, 2011, was the last day on the air for Freedom Radio. The last song played was &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White, &amp; Blue (The Angry American)&quot; by country singer Toby Keith, and the last piece of audio ever heard on the station was Porky Pig&#x27;s famous &quot;That&#x27;s all Folks!&quot; exclamation.

<doc id="1031705" wikidata="Q7309132" url="?curid=1031705" title="Regional Railways">
<text>Regional Railways was one of the three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982 that existed until 1997, two years after Privatisation of British Rail. The sector was originally called &quot;Provincial&quot;.

Regional Railways was the most subsidised (per passenger km) of the three sectors. Upon formation, its costs were four times its revenue.

The sector was broken up into eight franchises during the privatisation of British Rail and ceased to exist on 31 March 1997.

==Formation==
Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; London &amp; South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area, and Provincial (renamed Regional Railways in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services. In the metropolitan counties, local services were managed by the Passenger Transport Executives.

==Services==

Regional Railways inherited a diverse range of routes, comprising both express and local services. Expresses mainly ran to non-principal destinations or on less popular routes, such as Birmingham or Liverpool to Norwich, or Liverpool to Scarborough, and were chiefly operated by older locomotives and second-hand InterCity coaches. Later these services were operated by Sprinter units – mainly British Rail Class 158 on express services. There were also the internal Scottish Region local services and expresses, the latter including the Edinburgh-Glasgow push-pull service.

Local services ran on both main lines and branch lines and were often operated by first generation diesel multiple units dating back to the 1950s. Longer distance trains were often formed of older coaches and locomotives of British Rail Class 31, British Rail Class 40, and British Rail Class 45, which were of similar vintage.

==Development of new rolling stock==
In the early 1980s, large numbers of diesel multiple unit (DMU) and locomotive-hauled coaches were found to contain asbestos. Removing this would be a considerable cost and generating no extra revenue, which, coupled with the increasingly unreliable old locomotives and DMUs, prompted BR to look for a new generation of diesel multiple units.

The prototype British Rail Class 210, in service on a trial basis since 1981, were considered too expensive to be put into production, so BR looked elsewhere for new designs.

===Pacer (train)===
The first, &quot;Pacers&quot;, used bus technology from the Leyland National, in classes numbered in the 14X range. Not long after introduction to service, large numbers of them suffered from a number of technical problems, particularly with their gearboxes. In Cornwall it was found that their long wheelbase caused intolerable squealing noises and high tyre wear on tight curves, and they quickly had to be replaced by the old DMUs. The solution lay elsewhere, although, after much modification, the Pacers eventually proved themselves in traffic.

===Sprinters===
 BR needed something midway between the Pacers and the British Rail Class 210s. In 1984/1985, two experimental DMU designs were put into service: the British Rail Engineering Limited built British Rail Class 150 and Metro-Cammell built British Rail Class 151. Both of these used hydraulic transmission and were less bus-like than the Pacers. After trials, British Rail Class 150 was selected for production, entering service from 1987. Reliability was much improved by the new units, with depot visits being reduced from two or three times a week to fortnightly.

The late 1980s and early 1990s also saw the development of secondary express services that complemented the mainline InterCity (British Rail) routes. British Rail Class 155 and British Rail Class 156 Sprinters were developed to replace locomotive-hauled trains on these services, their interiors being designed with longer distance journeys in mind. Key Scottish and Trans-Pennine routes were upgraded with new British Rail Class 158 Express Sprinters, while a network of &#x27;Alphaline&#x27; services was introduced elsewhere in the country.
By the end of the 1980s, passenger numbers had increased and costs had been reduced to two-and-a-half times revenue.

===Electrification===

The British Rail Class 323 electric multiple units were built by Hunslet Transportation Projects and Holec Ridderkerk between 1992 and 1995, although mock-ups and prototypes were built and tested in 1990 and 1991. Forty-three 3-car units were built for inner-suburban services in and around Birmingham and Manchester, including the Cross-City Line in the Birmingham area and services to the new Manchester Airport railway station.

== Rolling Stock ==
==Livery==

Initially, many vehicles carried standard British Rail blue livery.

From 1986, Provincial adopted a version of the prototype Class 150 livery: &quot;aircraft blue&quot; over white, with a light blue stripe at waist level. All new units, plus a few existing ones, such as selected Class 304 EMUs, received it. Some units and coaches received the livery with either &quot;ScotRail&quot; or &quot;Regional Railways&quot; branding.

The British Rail Class 158s, introduced in 1989, appeared in &quot;Express&quot; livery: dark grey window surrounds over light grey, with light and dark blue stripes at waist level. This colour scheme was also applied to some British Rail Class 156 units around privatisation.

The British Rail Class 323 EMUs introduced in 1994 appeared in the &quot;West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive&quot; (Centro) livery for the West Midlands-based sets, and the &quot;Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive&quot; (GMPTE) livery for Manchester-based sets.

After privatisation, many vehicles continued to carry the basic RR colour scheme but with the addition of different branding, e.g. &quot;Central Trains&quot;.

The final British railway vehicle to carry Regional Railways livery was a British Rail Class 153, which was repainted in July 2008 into &quot;East Midlands Trains&quot; livery.

==Split for privatisation==
As part of the process of privatisation between 1994 and 1997, Regional Railways was split into several different shadow train operating units, which later became independent train operating companies:

<doc id="1031708" wikidata="Q3338686" url="?curid=1031708" title="Macassar oil">
<text>Macassar oil is an oil that was originally compounded from Macassar ebony oil that was used primarily by Western European men throughout the 1800s and early 1900s as a hair conditioner to groom and style the hair.

It was popularised by Alexander Rowland (1747–1823), a celebrated London barber. It was then not uncommon for barbers to make their own hair preparations and around 1793 Rowland began offering Rowland&#x27;s Macassar Oil. Within two decades it had become hugely popular and was aggressively advertised with extravagant claims of its effectiveness, becoming one of the first nationally advertised products.

The words &quot;Macassar Oil&quot; were registered as a trademark by A. Rowland &amp; Sons in 1888. Rowland&#x27;s son (also named Alexander) later stated that a relative living in the island of Celebes in the Dutch East Indies had helped in procurement of the basic ingredient.

Although it was originally made with &quot;Schleichera oleosa&quot; oil (known as &quot;kayu hitam&quot; where it is still used in Indonesia), due to the difficulty of obtaining it, as a result of the decline in the availability of the tree (as the result of being overharvested for lumber), it was increasingly made with vegetable oils, such as coconut, palm or Kusum oil, combined with fragrant oils such as ylang-ylang.

Macassar oil was so named because it was reputed to have been manufactured from ingredients purchased in the port of Makassar in the Dutch East Indies. The poet Byron facetiously called it &quot;thine incomparable oil, Macassar&quot; in the first canto of &quot;Don Juan&quot;, and Lewis Carroll also mentions &quot;Rowland&#x27;s Macassar Oil&quot; in the poem &quot;Haddocks&#x27; Eyes&quot; from &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;.
Due to the tendency for the oil to transfer from the user&#x27;s hair to the back of his chair, the antimacassar was developed. This is a small washable cloth (crocheted, embroidered or mass-produced), placed over the back of a chair to protect the upholstery.

<text>An antimacassar is a small cloth placed over the backs or arms of chairs, or the head or cushions of a sofa, to prevent soiling of the permanent fabric underneath. The name also refers to the cloth flap &#x27;collar&#x27; on a sailor&#x27;s shirt or top, used to keep macassar oil off the uniform.

==History==

Macassar oil was an unguent for the hair commonly used by men in the early 19th century and reputed to have been manufactured from ingredients purchased in the port of Makassar in the Dutch East Indies. The poet Byron called it &quot;thine incomparable oil, Macassar&quot;. The fashion for oiled hair became so widespread in the Victorian and the Edwardian period that housewives began to cover the arms and backs of their chairs with washable cloths to prevent the fabric coverings from being soiled. Around 1850, these started to be known as antimacassars. They were also installed in theatres from 1865.

They came to have elaborate patterns, often in matching sets for the various items of parlor furniture; they were either made at home using a variety of techniques such as crochet or tatting or purchased. The original antimacassars were usually made of stiff white crochet-work. 

In the third quarter of the 19th century, they became simpler and softer, usually fabric embroidered with a simple pattern in wool or silk.

By the beginning of the 20th century, antimacassars had become so associated in people&#x27;s minds with the Victorian period that the word briefly became a figurative term for it. For example, antimacassars are suggestive of old-fashioned, Victorian-era women in Rebecca West&#x27;s novel &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot;.

Antimacassars are also used on the seat headrests of commercial passenger transport vehicles, such as trains, buses and, especially, aircraft, to prevent the transmission of hair dressings and medical conditions between passengers, simplify maintenance, and extend the life of fabrics.

<text>A computer experiment or simulation experiment is an experiment used to study a computer simulation, also referred to as an in silico system. This area includes computational physics, computational chemistry, computational biology and other similar disciplines.

==Background==
Computer simulations are constructed to emulate a physical system. Because these are meant to replicate some aspect of a system in detail, they often do not yield an analytic solution. Therefore, methods such as discrete event simulation or finite element solvers are used. A computer model is used to make inferences about the system it replicates. For example, climate models are often used because experimentation on an earth sized object is impossible.

==Objectives==
Computer experiments have been employed with many purposes in mind. Some of those include: 
* Uncertainty quantification: Characterize the uncertainty present in a computer simulation arising from unknowns during the computer simulation&#x27;s construction.
* Inverse problems: Discover the underlying properties of the system from the physical data.
* Bias correction: Use physical data to correct for bias in the simulation.
* Data assimilation: Combine multiple simulations and physical data sources into a complete predictive model.
* Systems design: Find inputs that result in optimal system performance measures.

==Computer simulation modeling==
Modeling of computer experiments typically uses a Bayesian framework. Bayesian statistics is an interpretation of the field of statistics where all evidence about the true state of the world is explicitly expressed in the form of probabilities. In the realm of computer experiments, the Bayesian interpretation would imply we must form a prior distribution that represents our prior belief on the structure of the computer model. The use of this philosophy for computer experiments started in the 1980s and is nicely summarized by Sacks et al. (1989) . While the Bayesian approach is widely used, frequentist approaches have been recently discussed .

The basic idea of this framework is to model the computer simulation as an unknown function of a set of inputs. The computer simulation is implemented as a piece of computer code that can be evaluated to produce a collection of outputs. Examples of inputs to these simulations are coefficients in the underlying model, initial conditions and forcing functions. It is natural to see the simulation as a deterministic function that maps these &quot;inputs&quot; into a collection of &quot;outputs&quot;. On the basis of seeing our simulator this way, it is common to refer to the collection of inputs as formula_1, the computer simulation itself as formula_2, and the resulting output as formula_3. Both formula_1 and formula_3 are vector quantities, and they can be very large collections of values, often indexed by space, or by time, or by both space and time.

Although formula_6 is known in principle, in practice this is not the case. Many simulators comprise tens of thousands of lines of high-level computer code, which is not accessible to intuition. For some simulations, such as climate models, evaluation of the output for a single set of inputs can require millions of computer hours .

===Gaussian process prior===
The typical model for a computer code output is a Gaussian process. For notational simplicity, assume formula_7 is a scalar. Owing to the Bayesian framework, we fix our belief that the function formula_2 follows a Gaussian process,
formula_9
where formula_10 is the mean function and formula_11 is the covariance function. Popular mean functions are low order polynomials and a popular covariance function is Matern covariance, which includes both the exponential (formula_12) and Gaussian covariances (as formula_13).

==Design of computer experiments==
The design of computer experiments has considerable differences from design of experiments for parametric models. Since a Gaussian process prior has an infinite dimensional representation, the concepts of A and D criteria (see Optimal design), which focus on reducing the error in the parameters, cannot be used. Replications would also be wasteful in cases when the computer simulation has no error. Criteria that are used to determine a good experimental design include integrated mean squared prediction error and distance based criteria .

Popular strategies for design include latin hypercube sampling and low discrepancy sequences.

===Problems with massive sample sizes===
Unlike physical experiments, it is common for computer experiments to have thousands of different input combinations. Because the standard inference requires matrix inversion of a square matrix of the size of the number of samples (formula_14), the cost grows on the formula_15. Matrix inversion of large, dense matrices can also cause numerical inaccuracies. Currently, this problem is solved by greedy decision tree techniques, allowing effective computations for unlimited dimensionality and sample size patent WO2013055257A1, or avoided by using approximation methods, e.g. .

<text>No. 1312 Flight Royal Air Force, commonly abbreviated to 1312 Flt RAF, is an independent aircraft flight of the Royal Air Force (RAF). Currently based at Royal Air Force Station Mount Pleasant (more commonly known as RAF Mount Pleasant, and also known as Mount Pleasant Airport, MPA, and Mount Pleasant Complex) in East Falkland, 1312 Flt are supporting at present the defence of the Falkland Islands and other nearby British Overseas Territories.

The Royal Air Force contribution to British Forces South Atlantic Islands (BFSAI) is based at Mount Pleasant; the primary frontline component is No. 1435 Flight, with its four Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 advanced multi-role combat aircraft. 1312 Flight provides aerial refuelling, air transport, search and rescue, and maritime patrol. The latter is an important mission to the Falkland Islands government, as its Airbus A400M Atlas C1 (and its precessor Lockheed C-130K Hercules) verifies that all fishing vessels are licensed; at £1,000 per licence per season - an important source of income. The flight motto is &#x27;Uphold the Right&#x27;; the motto of the Falkland Islands is &#x27;Desire the Right&#x27;.

==No. 1312 Flight history==
No 1312 (Transport) Flight was first formed on , at RAF Llandow, south Wales. It originally operated six Avro Ansons to collect and deliver aircrew involved in the ferrying replacement aircraft to operational squadrons. After June 1944, it was involved in transporting wounded serviceman back to England from France, until it was disbanded on .

1312 was re-formed on , at RAF Abingdon, as No 1312 (Transport Support) Flight; operating the Handley Page Hastings, and later the Vickers Valetta, disbanding on .

No 1312 (In Flight Refuelling) Flight re-formed again on at RAF Stanley, before moving to the newly opened RAF Mount Pleasant in 1986, where it remains current. The original task was to operate the Lockheed C-130K Hercules C1K on air-to-air refuelling missions, but this was later replaced by a Vickers VC10 K4 (borrowed from 101 Squadron) and C-130K Hercules C1s from the Lyneham Wing. On 31 August 2013, the VC10 was replaced by a Lockheed TriStar K1 from 216 Squadron.

Presently, 1312 Flt utilise aircraft and crew from RAF Brize Norton. Specifically, No. 70 Squadron provide an Airbus A400M Atlas C1, whilst No. 10 and 101 Squadron provide an Airbus Voyager KC3.

==Unit badge==
Whilst it is common for RAF stations and RAF flying squadrons to be authorised to display an official heraldic badge following Royal approval, historically, it was extremely rare for RAF Flights to be granted authority for such. However, in recent times, the Royal Air Force has been more accommodating in granting Flights with their own unit badge such as the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.

The quest for an official heraldic badge for 1312 Flight began sometime 2000. No 1435 Flight&#x27;s badge contained a Cassin&#x27;s Falcon (a Peregrine falcon, common in the Falklands), so in keeping with the larger transport aircraft operated by 1312, a larger bird, the Upland Goose was chosen. &#x27;Uphold the Right&#x27; was selected as the official motto, in keeping with other MPA units, and the Falkland Island&#x27;s own motto, &#x27;Desire the Right&#x27;. The badge was eventually awarded August 2002, and received its Royal approval in 2003.

<doc id="1031728" wikidata="Q1059718" url="?curid=1031728" title="Masashi Sada">
<text>is a Japanese singer, lyricist, and composer.

Sada formed the folk duo Grape with Masami Yoshida in 1972, and they made their debut as recording artists a year afterward. The pair rose to fame owing to the hit song &quot;Shourou Nagashi&quot; () composed by Sada, which peaked at the number-two position on the Japanese Oricon chart in 1974. They broke up in 1976, after producing some hit singles including &quot;En-kiri Dera&quot; () and &quot;Muen Zaka&quot; ().

Sada released his first solo album entitled &quot;Kikyorai&quot; shortly after Grape&#x27;s dissolution. Following the commercial success of the number-one hit single &quot;Amayadori&quot; (, Shelter from the rain) in 1977, he enjoyed a recording career as one of the most popular Japanese male artists during the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s.

Throughout his career as a musician, Sada released over 35 solo albums and 70 singles, and multiple live albums or compilations. Since the release of &quot;Shourou Nagashi&quot;, published in 2001, Sada has also worked as a novelist.

<doc id="1031735" wikidata="Q2527730" url="?curid=1031735" title="I Am Cuba">
<text>I Am Cuba (; , &quot;Ya – Kuba&quot;) is a 1964 film directed by Mikhail Kalatozov at Mosfilm. An international co-production between the Soviet Union and Cuba, it is an anthology film mixing political drama and propaganda. 

The film was almost completely forgotten until it was re-discovered by filmmakers in the United States thirty years later. The acrobatic tracking shots and idiosyncratic &quot;mise-en-scène&quot; prompted Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese to begin a campaign to restore the film in the early 1990s.

&quot;I Am Cuba&quot; is shot in black and white, sometimes using infrared film obtained from the Soviet military to exaggerate contrast (making trees and sugar cane almost white, and skies very dark but still obviously sunny). Most shots are in extreme wide-angle and the camera passes very close to its subjects, whilst still largely avoiding having those subjects ever look directly at the camera.

== Plot ==
The movie consists of four distinct short stories about the suffering of the Cuban people and their reactions, varying from passive amazement in the first, to a guerrilla march in the last. Between the stories, a female narrator (credited &quot;The Voice of Cuba&quot;) says such things as, &quot;I am Cuba, the Cuba of the casinos, but also of the people.&quot;

The first story (centered on the character Maria) shows the destitute Cuban masses contrasted with the splendor in the American-run gambling casinos. Maria lives in a shanty-town on the edge of Havana and hopes to marry her fruit-seller boyfriend, René. He is unaware that she leads an unhappy double-life as &quot;Betty&quot;, a bar prostitute at one of the Havana casinos catering to rich Americans. One night, her client asks her if he can see where she lives rather than take her to his own room. She takes him to her small hovel where she reluctantly undresses in front of him. The next morning he tosses her a few dollars and takes her most prized possession, her crucifix necklace. As he is about to leave René walks in and sees his ashamed fiancée. The American callously says, &quot;Goodbye Betty!&quot; as he makes his exit. He is disoriented by the squalor he encounters as he tries to find his way out of the area.

The next story is about a farmer, Pedro, who just raised his best crop of sugar yet. However, his landlord rides up to the farm as he is harvesting his crops and tells him that he has sold the land that Pedro lives on to United Fruit, and Pedro and his family must leave immediately. Pedro asks what about the crops? The landowner says, &quot;you raised them on my land. I&#x27;ll let you keep the sweat you put into growing them, but that is all,&quot; and he rides off. Pedro lies to his children and tells them everything is fine. He gives them all the money he has and tells them to have a fun day in town. After they leave, he sets all of his crops and house on fire. He then dies from the smoke inhalation.

The third story describes the suppression of rebellious students led by a character named Enrique at Havana University (featuring one of the longest camera shots). Enrique is frustrated with the small efforts of the group and wants to do something drastic. He goes off on his own planning on assassinating the chief of police. However, when he gets him in his sights, he sees that the police chief is surrounded by his young children, and Enrique cannot bring himself to pull the trigger. While he is away, his fellow revolutionaries are printing flyers. They are infiltrated by police officers who arrest them. One of the revolutionaries begins throwing flyers out to the crowd below only to be shot by one of the police officers. Later on, Enrique is leading a protest at the university. More police are there to break up the crowd with fire hoses. Enrique is shot after the demonstration becomes a riot. At the end, his body is carried through the streets; he has become a martyr to his cause.

The final part shows Mariano, a typical farmer, who rejects the requests of a revolutionary soldier to join the ongoing war. The soldier appeals to Mariano&#x27;s desire for a better life for his children, but Mariano only wants to live in peace and insists the soldier leave. Immediately thereafter though, the government&#x27;s planes begin bombing the area indiscriminately. Mariano&#x27;s home is destroyed and his son is killed. He then joins the rebels in the Sierra Maestra Mountains, ultimately leading to a triumphal march into Havana to proclaim the revolution.

== Production ==

Shortly after the 1959 Cuban Revolution overthrew the United States-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, the socialist Castro government, isolated by the United States after the latter broke diplomatic and trade relations in 1961, turned to the USSR in many areas, including for film partnerships. The Soviet government, interested in promoting international socialism, and perhaps in need to further familiarize itself with its new ally, agreed to collaborate with the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC), and finance a film about the Cuban revolution. Shooting began on February 26, 1963.

The director was given considerable freedom to complete the work, and was given much help from both the Soviet and Cuban governments. Among his inspirations for the project was Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s unfinished &quot;¡Que viva México!&quot;, another Soviet project about a post-revolutionary Latin American nation. Among Kalatozov&#x27;s Cuban collaborators on the project were screenwriter Enrique Pineda Barnet and composer Carlos Fariñas.

The film made use of many innovative techniques, such as coating a watertight camera&#x27;s lens with a special submarine periscope cleaner, so the camera could be submerged and lifted out of the water without any drops on the lens or film. At one point, more than 1,000 Cuban soldiers were moved to a remote location to shoot one scene.

In another scene, the camera follows a flag over a body, held high on a stretcher, along a crowded street. Then it stops and slowly moves upwards for at least four storeys until it is filming the flagged body from above a building. Without stopping, it then starts tracking sideways and enters through a window into a cigar factory, then goes straight towards a rear window where the cigar workers are watching the procession. The camera finally passes through the window and appears to float along over the middle of the street between the buildings. These shots were accomplished by the camera operator having the camera attached to his vest—like an early, crude version of a Steadicam—while also wearing a vest with hooks on the back. An assembly line of technicians would hook and unhook the operator&#x27;s vest to various pulleys and cables that spanned floors and building roof tops.

== Reception ==

Despite its dazzling technical and formal achievements receiving excellent support, and the participation of the renowned team of Soviet cinematographers Mikhail Kalatozov and Sergei Urusevsky (winners of the 1958 Cannes Film Festival Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;The Cranes are Flying&quot;, another virtuosistic art film, and also in the midst of the Cold War), the movie was given a rather cold reaction by audiences. In Havana it was criticized for showing a stereotypical view of Cubans, and in Moscow it was considered naïve, not sufficiently revolutionary, even too sympathetic to the lives of the bourgeois, pre-Castro classes.

The film was shot during a period of relatively uneasy relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. The recently concluded Cuban Missile Crisis had ended with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev removing its missiles from the island without consulting Cuban leader Fidel Castro, which opened a period of disagreements between the nations over revolutionary strategy.

Cameraman Alexander Calzatti stated that the crew &quot;was so enthusiastic [that] we were infected by it, and we worked very hard&quot;; as a result &quot;very soon after we came back to Russia, more than half of our crew died. I survived because I was very young.&quot;

The movie never reached Western countries during its original release, being a communist production in the midst of the Cold War era during the United States embargo against Cuba. 

Up until the 1990s, the film was relatively unknown to the general public both locally and internationally. This changed when Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola subsequently began to promote the film after it came to their attention. Their love for the film differed from the public opinion at the time as critics called it emotionally dragged out and lacking in sophistication film wise. Others thought that the actual filming of the movie was chaotic and brought the audience close to fainting.

== Restoration ==

Until the USSR collapsed in the early 1990s, &quot;I Am Cuba&quot; was virtually unknown. In 1992, a print of the film was screened at the Telluride Film Festival. The San Francisco International Film Festival screened the film in 1993. Shortly after the festival, three film professionals who had screened &quot;I Am Cuba&quot; at the San Francisco screening contacted friends at Milestone Films, a small New York film distributor specializing in the release of once-lost and neglected older films. Milestone screened a slightly blurry, unsubtitled VHS tape of the film and then went about acquiring the distribution rights from Mosfilm in Russia. Milestone&#x27;s release opened at New York&#x27;s Film Forum in March 1995. For the tenth anniversary of the film release, Milestone debuted a new 35 mm restoration of &quot;I Am Cuba&quot; without the Russian overdubbing in September 2005. Milestone released an Ultimate Edition DVD boxset at the time as well, with a video appreciation from Scorsese.

On 19 March 2018, Milestone posted a trailer for their new 4K restoration of the film. It became available later that year on Milestone films&#x27; Vimeo powered streaming service, with original Spanish audio but at 1080p HD.

On 9 March 2020, Mosfilm publicly released the entire film in 4K with hardcoded Russian overdubbing on their YouTube channel.

Sometime after April 2021, the film was removed from Milestone films&#x27; streaming catalog on Vimeo because they sold the film&#x27;s US distribution license, assumably back to Mosfilm. Milestone never released the film in 4K but gave refunds to upset customers.

On 29 October 2021, Mosfilm released the film on their English-language YouTube channel. From an archival perspective, it is inferior to Mosfilm&#x27;s previous 4K release due to its hardcoded English subtitles, watermarking, Russian overdubbing, and 16:9 pillarboxing.

The Criterion Collection released a 4K restoration of &quot;I Am Cuba&quot; on Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, with the film&#x27;s original Spanish audio, in April 2024.

== Documentary ==
In 2005, a documentary about the making of &quot;I Am Cuba&quot; was released called &quot;Soy Cuba: O Mamute Siberiano&quot; or &quot;I Am Cuba: the Siberian Mammoth&quot;, directed by the Brazilian Vicente Ferraz. The documentary looks at the history of the making of the film, explains some of the technical feats of the film, and features interviews with many of the people who worked on it.

<doc id="1031737" wikidata="Q7736708" url="?curid=1031737" title="The Glass House (2001 TV series)">
<text>The Glass House was a half-hour Australian comedy talk show which screened on the ABC from 2001 to 2006.

It was hosted by stand-up comedian Wil Anderson, and co-hosted by fellow television and radio comedians Corinne Grant and Dave Hughes. Two additional guests joined the regular cast each week, including musicians, politicians, actors, radio personalities and other celebrities of varying calibre, such as Young Australian of the Year winners and Olympic athletes. Regular guests included comedians Adam Spencer and Akmal Saleh, netballer Liz Ellis, &quot;Play School&quot; host Rhys Muldoon, musician Pinky Beecroft, and music critic Molly Meldrum. The show thrived on taking regular shots at, among others, Shannon Noll, Amanda Vanstone, Naomi Robson, Shane Warne and Peter Costello. The format of the programme is similar to that of the BBC series, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

The show was pre-recorded in front of a live audience in the ABC&#x27;s Sydney studio on Tuesday evenings. During the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the show was taped inside the Melbourne Town Hall. The program initially screened on Friday nights, but suffered from an inconsistent timeslot, resulting in humorous TV spots, for example &quot;9:30 Friday...probably&quot;. In 2005, &quot;The Glass House&quot; shifted to a more reliable timeslot on Wednesday at 9:35pm.

The show was recognised by the AFI Awards in 2005, winning Best Light Entertainment in the Television category, and beating long-time rival and ABC stablemate &quot;Enough Rope&quot;. Also in 2005, &quot;The Glass House&quot; was voted Most Under Acknowledged TV Show in one of the categories for the satirical TV Fugly Awards.

==Segments==
The show opened with &quot;Ahead in The Glass House...&quot;, where an (unseen) upcoming segment is announced followed by a few seconds of out-of-context news footage, usually taken from an interview of an Australian political figure.

The main part of the show began with Anderson seated on steps at the front of the stage, who begins with &quot;Welcome to the Glass House, the program that asks the question...&quot;, the question concerning an event from the past week. Anderson will then joke about one to four unusual stories and introduce Corinne Grant, who enters from the camera left. Grant starts off with a pun on Anderson&#x27;s name and performs a similar, but shorter monologue. Anderson then introduced Dave Hughes who enters from the camera right, and usually begins with &quot;This week I&#x27;m...&quot; and followed by an emotion, usually &#x27;angry&#x27;, ad-libbing his concerns. The two guests are announced and greeted by Anderson while the panel assembles at the boomerang-shaped table.

Regular segments included:
* &quot;Movers and Shakers&quot;, concerning stories about unusual trendsetters or pioneers. Anderson will read from teleprompter a short monologue concerning each story, then throw it open to one of the guests, Hughes or Grant for discussion. There are usually three of these, taking up about half the show.
* &quot;Later in The Glass House&quot;, a short sequence filmed in the same style as the opening, with the voice-over beginning with &quot;Later in The Glass House&quot;.
* &quot;Second Rate Media Watch&quot;. A play on the ABC&#x27;s serious &quot;Media Watch&quot; program. This segment is similar in structure to &quot;Movers and Shakers&quot;. However, the story discussed is one that has appeared on a television, radio or internet medium, instead of &quot;Movers and Shakers&quot;&#x27; newspaper articles.
* &quot;Question on the Glass House&quot;. Shows footage of Hughes in the theatre lobby before the show, getting vox pops from the studio audience before the show, normally using a simple one line question. Some participants answer seriously, others not so seriously, and others try to hide.
* &quot;Interview with Hughesy&quot;. A continuation of &quot;Questions on the Glass House&quot;, in this segment Anderson introduces a single story related to the questions previously asked, after which Hughes is asked to help by roleplaying a significant newsmaker from the story. Donning an often ridiculous hat or costume prop, Hughes then has to answer questions from the other panelists.

Other segments:

* &quot;Rogues&#x27; Gallery&quot;. Here, the panelists examine and make fun of interesting or funny photos from the week&#x27;s media.
* &quot;Contact with the Great Unwashed&quot;. Anderson takes a microphone into the audience to ask them to suggest a recent event for the panel to discuss.

Closing segments:
The show ends with two segments performed by Anderson:

* &quot;The Trophy&quot;. Anderson announces the end of the show with the line &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s time to award the coveted Glass House trophy, which this week is called...&quot; followed with a short animation of a humorous plaque (often alliterative or a tongue twister). The winner is the person or thing responsible for the news item. The trophy is golden figure holding an umbrella, to protect him from shattering glass. The trophy was originally known as &quot;The Golden Shier&quot;, a pun on Jonathan Shier, then responsible for running the ABC, giving an alternate purpose for the trophy&#x27;s umbrella. The umbrella has been broken off at least twice during a show recording, although only the first occasion made it to air.
* &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Headlines&quot;. A newspaper headline for the week is shown (and read), followed by a humorous sub-heading.

==Cancellation==
On 31 October 2006, the ABC announced the program was cancelled and the final episode of the series would go to air on 29 November 2006 as a one-hour special. Anderson mentioned on the show that they may look at Network Ten as a possible home for the show in the future.

The ABC decision generated public interest, with suggestions the decision may have been politically motivated. Dave Hughes stated that &quot;We have had our best ratings ever,&quot;.

The cancellation occurred in the same year as the ABC&#x27;s decision not to publish the biography of Alan Jones and followed revelations the ABC had begun a new investigation into bias in its programs. The decision occurred one day after NSW senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells told ABC executives under their questioning that co-host Corinne Grant had been guilty of a serious conflict of interest because she was the public face of the ACTU&#x27;s workplace relations campaign.

Numerous online groups and petitions were created in an attempt to keep the show on air. Although the move came in the middle of federal government attempts to force changes in the management and policies of the ABC to remove perceived bias, then Prime Minister John Howard said he did not ask the ABC Board to axe the show.

The final episode was ranked the week&#x27;s 10th most watched show nationally with 1.15 million viewers, which also provided the highest ever ratings for &quot;The Glass House&quot;.

<text>Jutta Rabe (born 1955) is a German journalist and a former treasurer of the Berlin chapter of the German Federation of Journalists.

== Life ==
Jutta Rabe studied economy and journalism.

She worked as a freelancer for the German TV-magazine Spiegel-TV for a number of years, as well as for Focus TV, ZDF, ARTE and NDR.

Her book, &quot;Die Estonia: Tragödie eines Schiffsuntergangs&quot; (, ), about the alleged cover-up of the true cause of the September 1994 M/S Estonia passenger ferry disaster, was made into the 2003 film &quot;Baltic Storm&quot;. The video footage of her group&#x27;s diving expedition to the Estonia shipwreck allegedly reveals holes in the ship&#x27;s hull, suggesting that explosives played a role in the tragedy. Spiegel-TV has dissociated itself from her coverage of the Estonia disaster.

In the summer of 2000, Sweden issued an arrest warrant against Rabe for violating the sanctity of the shipwreck, in violation of the Estonia Agreement of 1995, barring her from entering Sweden on pain of prosecution.

<text>Sanjan is an ancient city on the southern edge of the Kara-kum Desert, in the vicinity of the historically eminent oasis-city of Merv. Topographically, Sanjan is located in the Greater Khorasan region of Central Asia. Politically, Sanjan is in the present-day Mary Province of Turkmenistan.

Together with Merv, Sanjan was an important stopping place and center of trade on the southern route of the Silk Road. Sanjan gained further importance following the Seleucid establishment of Merv as the principal city of the Margiana province, a status it also held during the subsequent Parthian (250 BCE–226 CE) and Sassanid (226-651 CE) eras.
As a site in the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex, Sanjan is subject to the hypothesis that the Indo-Iranians, a major branch that split off from the Proto-Indo-Europeans, originated there. (see also: BMAC:Indo-Iranian hypothesis)

According to the &quot;Qissa-i Sanjan&quot;, an epic poem from around 1600, the Zoroastrians who fled to the Indian subcontinent in the 8th or 9th century, to escape religious persecution from Islamic invaders, established the settlement of Sanjan (Gujarat). These Zoroastrians, who were at first called &quot;Sanjana&quot;s or &quot;Khorasani&quot;s (today, the descendants of these and later Zoroastrian emigrants are collectively known as the Parsis), are thought to have named the Indian west-coast settlement after the city of their origin.

&quot;Sanjan&quot; must not be confused with the phonetically similar Iranian province Zanjan, or its capital, the city of Zanjan.</text><links>

<text>Giovanni &quot;Tata&quot; Giacobetti (24 June 1922 – 2 December 1988) was an Italian singer and jazz musician. He is mostly known for being a member of the vocal quartet Quartetto Cetra.

==Biography==
Giacobetti was a self-taught musician. He learned to play bass and piano. He started singing at students&#x27; parties when he studied scenography at Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. In 1940–41 he co-founded a vocal quartet called Quartetto Egie, which changed line-up and name twice, becoming Quartetto Ritmo first and then Quartetto Cetra.

As part of Quartetto Cetra, Giacobetti&#x27;s show business career lasted for over forty years. He was singer and actor for radio, stage, TV, cinema and advertising.

Besides singing, he was the group&#x27;s main lyricist, often writing together with Virgilio Savona, who composed the music. Their collaboration resulted in hundreds of songs which went to form Quartetto Cetra&#x27;s vast repertoire.

Tata Giacobetti also wrote lyrics for other Italian musicians, including Gorni Kramer, Giovanni D&#x27;Anzi, and Armando Trovajoli.

In 1964 Giacobetti married Valeria Fabrizi, an Italian actress, singer and television personality. They had a daughter Giorgia Giacobetti.

Giacobetti passed away in December 1988, a few months after Quartetto Cetra&#x27;s final performance in Bologna.

<text>Antonio Virgilio Savona (21 December 1919 – 27 August 2009) was an Italian composer, arranger, and singer in the Italian vocal group, the Quartetto Cetra.

==Biography==
Savona was born in Palermo, Italy. His artistic career started very early. In 1926, aged 6, he began studying music. Two years later, he joined a choir and at the age of 10, he debuted in a radio broadcast playing a piece on a piano during a children&#x27;s program.

After high-school, Savona enrolled at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome to study piano.

In 1941, he replaced Iacopo Jacomelli in a vocal quartet called Quartetto Egie. The group changed name to Quartetto Ritmo at first, then to Quartetto Cetra one year later.

On 19 August 1944 Virgilio Savona married the singer Lucia Mannucci, who later joined Quartetto Cetra to replace Enrico De Angelis, who left the group in 1947.

Besides singing, Savona composed and arranged for the group. He wrote the music while Tata Giacobetti, another member of the quartet, wrote the lyrics. They collaborated for four decades and produced hundreds of songs which made up Quartetto Cetra&#x27;s vast repertoire.

Savona composed music and wrote scripts for radio and TV programs, stage shows and films. During the 1970s, he was active as pianist, orchestra conductor, arranger and producer. He extensively researched on folk songs. 
In 1971, he wrote &quot;Angela&quot;, a song for Angela Davis, Black American communist leader, innocent in prison at this time. In 70s, he published also other controversial songs, as &quot;Il testamento del parroco Meslier&quot; (&quot;The Testament of Parson Meslier&quot;), a violent attack on power and religion, based on the &quot;Testament&quot; of the priest and illuminist atheist philosopher Jean Meslier.

In 1991, he wrote a popup book about Quartetto Cetra, published by Sperling &amp; Kupfer in the &quot;Supersound&quot; collection.

In 2009, he died in Milan from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Lucia Mannucci (18 May 1920 – 7 March 2012) was an Italian singer, best known as one of the singers of Quartetto Cetra, an Italian vocal quartet.

Born in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, Mannucci relocated to Milan at a young age. She attended the Art of Movement school directed by Carla Strauss. She successfully auditioned for EIAR, the Italian national radio broadcasting company, and worked as a singer for various radio orchestras. She toured Italy for some years, working with such entertainers as Gorni Kramer, Natalino Otto, and the Quartetto Cetra.

On 19 August 1944, she married Virgilio Savona, one of the singers of the Quartetto Cetra. Three years later, she also joined the quartet, replacing Enrico De Angelis.

Mannucci was the only female member of Quartetto Cetra, but she also had a successful career as a solo singer. Besides working with Quartetto Cetra, Mannucci pursued a solo career as a singer, musical actress, and TV show hostess. She and her husband also did research on folk music.

Mannucci died in March 2012 in Milan, aged 91.

<text>Felice Chiusano (28 March 1922 – 3 February 1990) was one of the singers of Quartetto Cetra, a popular Italian vocal quartet.

==Biography==
Chiusano was born in Fondi, in the province of Latina, a region in Lazio.

Uncle-in-law of the anchorman Ettore Andenna.

He was a self-taught guitarist. Later on, he learned to play the drums. He left his native village before his twentieth birthday and moved to Rome. After work, he performed in local clubs as a singer and guitarist.

He successfully auditioned for EIAR, the Italian national radio broadcasting company, and worked as a singer for radio orchestras.

In 1941, he replaced Enrico Gentile in the line-up of Quartetto Ritmo, a vocal quartet soon to be renamed Quartetto Cetra.

Felice Chiusano was known as the &quot;bald head&quot; of Quartetto Cetra. He was famous for his sense of humour and jokes.

During the 1970s and 1980s, as Quartetto Cetra gradually scaled back their public appearances, he also worked in the organization of shows and cultural events.

Chiusano died in Milan in 1990.

<text>Enrico De Angelis (23 November 1920 – 21 August 2018) was an Italian singer and entrepreneur. His singing career took place during the 1940s.

==Biography==
De Angelis was part of a family of voice actors and dubbers. He was the oldest son of voice actor Gualtiero De Angelis. In 1940, he founded a vocal quartet named Quartetto Egie together with Tata Giacobetti, Iacopo Jacomelli and Enrico Gentile. They made their debut on 27 May 1940, at the Valle Theatre in Rome. They performed the song &quot;Bambina dall&#x27;abito blu&quot; (&quot;little girl in a blue dress&quot;). In a year&#x27;s time, the quartet changed line-up and name twice, becoming Quartetto Ritmo first and then Quartetto Cetra.

In October 1947, Enrico De Angelis left Quartetto Cetra to join the Army. He was replaced by Lucia Mannucci, a singer and the wife of Virgilio Savona. He later went on to work as a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.

==Death==
De Angelis died of an illness in Milan on 21 August 2018, at the age of 97.

<doc id="1031764" wikidata="Q2430567" url="?curid=1031764" title="Subterranean Homesick Blues">
<text>&quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; is a song by Bob Dylan, recorded on January 14, 1965, and released as a single by Columbia Records, catalogue number 43242, on March 8. It is the first track on the album &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, released some two weeks later. It was Dylan&#x27;s first Top 40 hit in the United States, peaking at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also entered the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. The song has subsequently been reissued on numerous compilations, the first being the 1967 singles compilation &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. One of Dylan&#x27;s first electric recordings, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; is also notable for its innovative music video, which first appeared in D. A. Pennebaker&#x27;s documentary &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;. An acoustic version of the song, recorded the day before the single, was released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;.

&quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; is ranked 187th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. In its contemporary review, &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as a &quot;rockin’-country folk blueser with a solid beat and catchy lyrics&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; guitar and harmonica playing.

==References and allusions==
In 2004, Dylan said of the song: &quot;It&#x27;s from Chuck Berry, a bit of &#x27;Too Much Monkey Business&#x27; and some of the scat songs of the &#x27;40s.&quot;

Dylan has also stated that when he attended the University of Minnesota in 1959, he fell under the influence of the Beat scene: &quot;It was Jack Kerouac, Ginsberg, Corso and Ferlinghetti.&quot; Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;The Subterraneans&quot;, a novel published in 1958 about the Beats, has been suggested as a possible inspiration for the song&#x27;s title.

The song&#x27;s first line is a reference to codeine distillation and the politics of the time: &quot;Johnny&#x27;s in the basement mixing up the medicine / I&#x27;m on the pavement thinkin&#x27; about the government&quot;. The song also depicts some of the growing conflicts between &quot;straights&quot; or &quot;squares&quot; and the emerging counterculture of the 1960s. The widespread use of recreational drugs and turmoil surrounding the Vietnam War were both starting to take hold of the nation, and Dylan&#x27;s hyperkinetic lyrics were dense with up-to-the-minute allusions to important emerging elements in the 1960s youth culture. According to rock journalist Andy Gill, &quot;an entire generation recognized the zeitgeist in the verbal whirlwind of &#x27;Subterranean Homesick Blues&#x27;.&quot;

The song also refers to the struggles surrounding the American civil rights movement (&quot;Better stay away from those / That carry &#x27;round a fire hose&quot;—during the civil rights movement, peaceful protestors were beaten and sprayed with high-pressure fire hoses). The song was Dylan&#x27;s first Top 40 hit in the United States.

==Influence==
&quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; has had a wide influence, resulting in iconic references by artists and non-artists alike. (Most infamously, its lyric &quot;you don&#x27;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows&quot; was the inspiration for the name of the American far-left organization known as the Weather Underground, which formed after breaking away from the Students for a Democratic Society.) In a 2007 study of legal opinions and briefs that found Dylan was quoted by judges and lawyers more than any other songwriter, &quot;you don&#x27;t need a weatherman...&quot; was distinguished as the line most often cited.

John Lennon was reported to find the song so captivating that he did not know how he would be able to write a song that could compete with it. The group Firehose took its name from a lyric from the song: &quot;Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose...&quot; A line in the song provided the Australian garage rock band Jet with the title of their debut album &quot;Get Born&quot;. &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; is referenced in the title of Radiohead&#x27;s song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; from the 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;.

==Versions==

Covers of the song span a range of styles, including those by the reggae musician Gregory Isaacs on &quot;Is It Rolling Bob?&quot;, his 2004 album of Dylan songs, with Toots Hibbert; the bluegrass musician Tim O&#x27;Brien on his 1996 album of Dylan covers, &quot;Red on Blonde&quot;; the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers on the 1987 album &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;; the Cajun-style fiddle player Doug Kershaw on &quot;Louisiana Man&quot; in 1978; and the singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson on his 1974 album &quot;Pussy Cats&quot;, produced by John Lennon, who admired the song. The song was also covered by Alanis Morissette when she stood in for Dylan at his 2005 induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame. In addition, Robert Wyatt&#x27;s &quot;Blues in Bob Minor&quot;, on his 1997 album &quot;Shleep&quot;, uses the song&#x27;s rhythm as a structural template.

In December 2009, the rapper Juelz Santana released the single &quot;Mixin&#x27; Up the Medicine&quot;, which features lyrics in the chorus, performed by alternative rapper Yelawolf, and maintains some of the song&#x27;s original acoustics. Ed Volker of the New Orleans Radiators also has performed the song in his solo shows and with the Radiators, often paired with &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;.

In 1985, British actor Tom Watt, at the time enjoying a high profile playing the role of Lofty Holloway in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, released a version of the song that made number 67 in the UK singles chart.

==Allusions in other artists&#x27; songs==
Elvis Costello cited &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; as inspiration for his 1978 song &quot;Pump It Up&quot; saying, &quot;It&#x27;s how rock and roll works. You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy. That&#x27;s what I did.&quot;

Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Villiers Terrace&quot; includes the lyric &quot;There&#x27;s people rolling &#x27;round on the carpet / Mixin&#x27; up the medicine.&quot;

Chumbawamba&#x27;s 2004 single &quot;The Wizard of Menlo Park&quot; features the lyric &quot;Old Thomas Edison, mixing up the medicine.&quot;

R.E.M.&#x27;s 1987 hit, &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot;, has been stated by guitarist Peter Buck to be an homage to the song.

Zounds&#x27; remixed single &quot;This Land&quot; contains the lyric &quot;fifteen years of schooling and they put you on the night shift.&quot;

The Hayes Carll track &quot;KMAG YOYO&quot; is a direct homage to the rhythms and subject matter of &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;.

The Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s 1989 single &quot;Blues from a Gun&quot; includes the lyric &quot;Look out kid, you&#x27;re gonna get hit&quot;, a line borrowed from the Dylan track.

Radiohead&#x27;s song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;, from their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;, pays homage by referencing Bob Dylan&#x27;s track in the title.

Robert Wyatt&#x27;s song &quot;Blues in Bob Minor&quot; from his 1997 album &quot;Shleep&quot; includes the line, &quot;Genuflecting, bowing deeply/It don&#x27;t take a weathergirl to see/Where the wind is blowing/What the wind is bending.&quot;

The Gaslight Anthem&#x27;s song &quot;Angry Johnny and the Radio&quot;, from their 2007 album &quot;Sink or Swim&quot;, includes the lyrics &quot;And I&#x27;m still here singin&#x27;, thinking about the government&quot; and &quot;Are you hidin&#x27; in a basement, mixin&#x27; up the medicine?&quot;

Beastie Boys&#x27; song &quot;Funky Donkey&quot; from their 2011 album &quot;Hot Sauce Committee Part Two&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;I don&#x27;t wear Crocs and I don&#x27;t wear sandals / The pump don&#x27;t work &#x27;cause the vandals took the handle.&quot;

Deaf Havana&#x27;s album &quot;Old Souls&quot; contains the song &quot;Subterranean Bullshit Blues&quot;, which references the title in homage to the songwriter James Veck-Gilodi&#x27;s respect for Dylan.

Adam Green&#x27;s song &quot;Novotel&quot; includes the lyric &quot;Novotel / The phone&#x27;s tapped anyway.&quot;

The alternative rock band fIREHOSE took their name from the following line in this song:
&quot;Walk on your tiptoes, don&#x27;t tie no bows.
Better stay away from those 
that carry around a firehose&quot;.

==Promotional film clip==

In addition to its influence on music, the song was used in one of the first &quot;modern&quot; promotional film clips, the forerunner of what was later known as the music video. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it seventh in the magazine&#x27;s October 1993 list of &quot;100 Top Music Videos&quot;. The original clip was the opening segment of D. A. Pennebaker&#x27;s film &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;, a documentary on Dylan&#x27;s 1965 tour of England. In the film, Dylan, who came up with the idea, holds up cue cards with selected words and phrases from the lyrics. The cue cards were written by Donovan, Allen Ginsberg, Bob Neuwirth and Dylan himself.

While staring at the camera, Dylan flips the cards as the song plays. There are intentional misspellings and puns throughout the clip: for instance, when the song&#x27;s lyrics say &quot;eleven dollar bills&quot;, the poster says &quot;20 dollar bills&quot;. The clip was shot in an alley close to the Savoy Hotel in London. Ginsberg is constantly visible in the background, talking to Neuwirth. For use as a trailer, the following text was superimposed at the end of the clip, Dylan and Ginsberg are exiting the frame: &quot;SURFACING HERE SOON | BOB DYLAN IN | DONT LOOK BACK By D. A. PENNEBAKER&quot;. The Savoy Hotel has retained much of its exterior as it was in 1965, and the alley used in the film has been identified as the Savoy Steps.

In addition to the Savoy Hotel clip, two alternative promotional films were shot: one in a park (Embankment Gardens, adjacent to the Savoy Hotel) where Dylan, Neuwirth and Ginsberg are joined by Dylan&#x27;s producer, Tom Wilson, and another shot on the roof of an unknown building. A montage of the clips can be seen in the documentary &quot;No Direction Home&quot;.

The film clip was used in September 2010 in a promotional video to launch Google Instant. As they are typed, the lyrics of the song generate search engine results pages.

The 1992 Tim Robbins film &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; features Robbins in the title role as a right-wing folk singer who uses Dylan&#x27;s cue-card concept for the song &quot;Wall Street Rap&quot;. 

&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s music video for the 2003 song &quot;Bob&quot; parodies Dylan&#x27;s music and writing style with a series of 38 palindromic sentences. The word &quot;Bob&quot; is itself a palindrome and Yankovic mimics Dylan&#x27;s video by dressing as Dylan and dropping cue cards that have the song&#x27;s lyrics on them.

Several other musicians have imitated or paid homage to the video by using a similar cue-card format, most notably Australian band INXS in the video for their 1987 song &quot;Mediate&quot; and the German band Wir sind Helden in their 2005 song &quot; (Just one word).

<doc id="1031766" wikidata="Q5438719" url="?curid=1031766" title="Fawaz al-Rabeiee">
<text>Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeiee (1979 – October 1, 2006) was a Yemeni Islamist militant who was a cell ringleader for al-Qaeda in Yemen (AQY). Rabeiee and his cell were responsible for several attacks and plots on behalf of AQY, most prominently the MV &quot;Limburg&quot; bombing.

Rabeiee was born in 1979 in Saudi Arabia to Yemeni parents. Him and his family was deported to Yemen by the Saudi government in 1990. In 2000, he travelled to Afghanistan and trained in al-Qaeda camp before returning to Yemen in late 2001. In February 2002, he was identified as the leader of an al-Qaeda cell preparing attacks against the United States. Throughout 2002, Rabeiee was responsible for planning and perpetrating several AQY attacks, including the bombing of a Civil Aviation Authority building in April, the MV &quot;Limburg&quot; bombing in October, and the attempted shootdown of a Hunt Oil helicopter in November.

Rabeiee was captured on 28 March 2003. Alongside his 14-man cell, he was convicted of several terrorist attacks by a Yemeni court and sentenced to 10 years in prison in August 2004. He was later sentenced to death by an appeal court in February 2005. On 3 February 2006, Rabeiee along with 22 other al-Qaeda-linked suspects escaped from a prison in Sanaa. After his escape, he was involved in planning two AQY suicide bombings in September 2006. Rabeiee was killed by Yemeni security forces on 1 October 2006.

== Early life ==
Rabeiee was born 1979 to Yemeni parents in Saudi Arabia. He was the third of four brothers and four sisters and attended attended al-Falah school in Jeddah. In 1990, he was among the near millions of Yemeni families expelled from Saudi Arabia due to Yemen&#x27;s support for Saddam Hussein during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. During the late 1990s, Rabeiee took a job in the personnel department in the presidential office in Yemen.

== Militant activities (2000–2003) ==

=== Afghanistan ===
In early 2000, Rabeiee along with two other individuals, including a former member of the Political Security Organization (PSO), travelled to Afghanistan in order to &quot;die as a martyr&quot;, claiming that the money he earned from his job within the Yemen was haram. Rabeiee spent the rest of the year and most of 2001 in Afghanistan, spending time with September 11 hijackers Muhammad Atta and Ziad Jarrah and allegedly training in an al-Qaeda camp with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

=== Al-Qaeda in Yemen ===
Rabeiee returned to Yemen in late 2001, becoming the ringleader of a 12-man AQY cell. On 11 February 2002, the FBI issued an alert warning of potential terrorist attacks against the United States or its oversea interests, claiming that Rabeiee was planning an attack alongside 16 other associates, some linked to Osama bin Laden. The FBI later dropped their search for six of the suspects after learning that they were already in Yemeni custody.

Rabeiee was involved in a bombing near Civil Aviation Authority offices in Sanaa on April 17 2002. He headed the AQY cell responsible for the MV &quot;Limburg&quot; bombing on 6 October 2002, which killed a Bulgarian sailor and injured 12 others. The attack was reportedly conducted on the orders of Abu Ali al-Harithi, the leader of AQY. Later in November, he and his brother Abu Bakr al-Rabeiee organized a cell for the attempted shootdown of a Hunt Oil helicopter, which injured two employees. 

==Capture and trial==
Rabeiee along with 10 other suspected militants were arrested by Yemeni authorities on 28 March 2003. The group was captured in Marib governorate after a helicopter chase.

The trial for the cell headed by Rabeiee, which was numbered at 15 people (one of whom was tried in absentia) began on 29 May 2004. The group was accused of involvement in several terrorist attacks and plots, including the MV &quot;Limburg&quot; bombing, the Hunt Oil helicopter attack, the Civil Aviation Authority bombing and a plot to assassinate the US ambassador to Yemen, Edmund Hull. The verdict for the trial was reached on 28 August, with Rabeiee along with his brother Abu Bakr being sentenced to 10 years in prison for their role in the Hunt Oil helicopter attack, and each being fined 18.3 million Yemeni riyals (US$99,457) for the Civil Aviation Authority bombing.

The appeal case for Rabeiee and the 14 other suspects was held in December of that year. During his final statement, Rabeiee confessed that he and other suspects were &quot;very close&quot; to Osama bin Laden and had pledged to him that they would kill Americans. He said that &quot;I would never nullify a pledge I gave to the imam of mujahideen Sheikh Osama Bin Laden,” and “Sheikh Osama asked me if we wanted to cut down a tree, should we hit it in different points? I replied: No, we should concentrate our hits on one point till the tree falls down,” referencing the United States. On 5 February 2005, Rabeiee was sentenced to death after being found guilty in planning the MV Limburg bombing as well as the killing of a Yemeni security officer.

==Escape and aftermath==

On 3 February 2006, Rabeiee along with 22 other al-Qaeda linked prisoners escaped from a PSO prison in Sanaa by digging a tunnel from their cell to a nearby mosque.

Rabeiee was involved in planning AQY&#x27;s first attacks since 2002, a pair of simultaneous suicide bombings in September 2006 targeting two oil facilities in Yemen.

== Death ==
On 1 October 2006, Rabeiee was alongside fellow al-Qaeda member Muhammad al-Daylami during a pre-dawn raid by Yemeni security forces in Sanaa. Based on a tip to Yemeni authorities, a house in a Sanaa suburb that Rabeiee was hiding in was raided, leading to a shootout which killed him and Daylami.

<text>Sidney Royse Lysaght (1856 - 1941) (pronounced LYE-suht) was a British writer of Irish ancestry.

==Early life==
Lysaght was born near Mallow, County Cork, son of architect Thomas Royse Lysaght (1827-1890) and Emily (née Moss; died 1905). Thomas&#x27;s father, William, was a small landowner at Hazelwood, Mallow, distantly connected with the Barons Lisle. He was educated at a preparatory school and an English public school before Trinity College Dublin.

==Career==
===Business===
His uncle, John Lysaght, was head of the family iron making concern, John Lysaght and Co. Sidney, who became a &quot;successful and wealthy businessman&quot;, spent most of his life with the firm, along with his brother William. He was particularly involved in the development of corrugated iron. Having travelled &quot;extensively throughout Australia, New Zealand, and Polynesia&quot;, he visited Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa in 1894.

===Writing===
Lysaght&#x27;s first work was &quot;A modern ideal, a dramatic poem&quot; (1886), &quot;followed by a number of novels, dramas, and volumes of poetry&quot; including &quot;Poems of the unknown way&quot; (1901), &quot;The marplot&quot; (1903), &quot;My tower in Desmond&quot; (1925), and &quot;A reading of life&quot; (1936). He wrote as &quot;S. R. Lysaght&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lysaght married Katherine (died 1953), daughter of Joseph Clarke, of Waddington, Lincolnshire; their only child was Edward Anthony Edgeworth Lysaght (later known as Edward MacLysaght), writer and authority on Irish family history. Lysaght died at the family estate, Hazelwood, near Mallow, which he had inherited. He also owned an extensive estate at Tuamgraney in County Clare, where he established a nursery industry. He had previously lived at Banwell Castle in Somerset.

<text>The Applix 1616 was a kit computer with a Motorola 68000 CPU, produced by a small company called Applix in Sydney, Australia, from 1986 to the early 1990s. It ran a custom multitasking multiuser operating system that was resident in ROM. A version of Minix was also ported to the 1616, as was the MGR Window System. Andrew Morton, designer of the 1616 and one of the founders of Applix, later became the maintainer of the 2.6 version of the Linux kernel.

== History ==
Paul Berger and Andrew Morton formed the Australian company Applix Pty. Ltd. in approximately 1984 to sell a Z80 card they had developed for the Apple IIc that allowed it to run CP/M. This product was not a commercial success, but Paul later proposed they develop a Motorola 68000-based personal computer for sale in kit form.

The project was presented to Jon Fairall, then editor of the Australia and New Zealand electronics magazine Electronics Today International, and in December 1986, the first of four construction articles was published as &quot;Project 1616&quot;, with the series concluding in June 1987. In October and November 1987, a disk controller card was also published as &quot;Project 1617&quot;.

Over the next decade, about 400 1616s were sold.

Applix Pty. Ltd., was in no way related to the North American company of the same name that produced Applixware.

== Hardware ==

=== Main board ===
The main board contains:
* a Motorola 68000 running at 7.5 MHz, or a 68010 running at 15 MHz.
* 512 kibibytes of Dynamic RAM
* between 64 kibibytes and 256 kibibytes of ROM
* on board bit mapped colour graphics (no &quot;text&quot; mode), with timing provided by a Motorola 6845 CRT controller. The video could produce 320x200 in 16 colours, or 640x200 in a palette of 4 colours out of 16, with a later modification providing a 960x512 monochrome mode. The frame buffer resided in system memory and video refresh provided DRAM refresh cycles. The video output was able to drive CGA, EGA, MGA and multisync monitors.
* dual RS-232 serial ports using a Zilog Z8530.
* a parallel port for Centronics-type printers or general purpose I/O. This was provided by a Rockwell 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter, which was also the source of timer interrupts.
* 4 channel analog/audio output via an 8 bit DAC and multiplexor.
* software audio/analogue input via the DAC and a comparator.
* a PC/XT keyboard interface.

The main board also had four 80-pin expansion slots. The 1616 shared this backplane with a platform developed by Andrew Morton for Keno Computer Systems, allowing the 1616 to use expansion boards developed for the Keno Computer Systems platform (primarily the 34010 graphics coprocessor), although the form-factor was different, which left the KCS cards sticking out of the top of the 1616 case.

=== Disk controller card ===
The disk controller card contains:
* A Zilog Z80 processor running at 8 MHz
* 32 kibibytes of ROM
* 64 kibibytes of static RAM
* a WD1772 floppy disk controller
* dual RS-232 serial ports using a Zilog Z8530
* An NCR5380 SCSI controller

The coprocessor is able to run ZRDOS (a CP/M clone), or can act as a smart disk controller.

=== Memory expansion card ===
The memory card:
* accepts between 1 and 4 megabytes of Dynamic RAM in 1 megabyte increments,
* has an optional memory management unit implemented in fast static RAM and PALs,
* Another NCR5380 SCSI hard disk interface. This SCSI controller was mapped into the 68000&#x27;s address space, and was considerably faster than the one on the Z80 coprocessor card.

=== 34010 graphics coprocessor card ===
The TMS34010 card was developed by Andrew Morton for Keno Computer Systems. The 34010 was a bit-addressable graphics processor with instructions for two-dimensional graphics primitives and arbitrary width arithmetic operations on pixel data.

=== User developed cards ===
* Graham Redwood developed an Ethernet card (wire-wrap or Speedwire prototype?).
* Philip Hutchison developed a Motorola 68030 coprocessor card (small run of working double sided PCBs).
* Kevin Bertram developed a Transputer card, an EPROM programmer, and an I/O card. (The EPROM programmer was manufactured under licence by Timothy Ward of Silicon Supply and Manufacturing.) (The I/O card design was used in development by Silicon Supply and Manufacturing of a CNC PC Drill which had a provisional patent, but never released as a kit.)

Other one-off interface cards were developed for specific projects, including a numerically controlled sheet metal spinning machine controller, several EEPROM programmers, etc.

== Operating systems ==

=== 1616/OS ===
1616/OS was initially little more than a powerful monitor, with commands for dumping and modifying memory, loading and saving to tape, and a built in macro assembler and full screen editor. Over time, the operating system gained a hierarchical file system, preemptive multitasking, support for multiple users with access controls (although no memory protection), lightweight threads, message passing primitives and pipes. Ultimately, the operating system had around 250 system calls, and 78 commands built into the shell. The operating system had enough similarity to Unix that porting Unix source to the 1616/OS was relatively painless.

=== Minix ===
Colin McCormack ported Minix to the 1616. He worked around the lack of a memory management unit when fork()ing by copying BSS, heap and stack of the child and parent processes before scheduling each one. The MMU on the RAM expansion card was developed to support Colin&#x27;s Minix port, although it&#x27;s unclear if it was ever used for this purpose.

=== ZRDOS ===
Conal Walsh ported the CP/M clone ZRDOS to the Z80-based disk controller card. When operating in this mode, the 68000 acted as a console for ZRDOS, although it was still possible to suspend the connection to ZRDOS, and run 1616 programs, provided they didn&#x27;t need disk I/O.

=== MGR ===
Not strictly an operating system, the MGR windowing system run under 1616/OS, but usurped the console video and keyboard, and added virtual tty devices for each window. The MGR port required a video hack to add a higher resolution but monochrome video mode; this was done by replacing a PAL in the video circuit.

== Applications ==
Most Unix and Minix programs were able to be ported to 1616/OS. Ports included:

:advent, ar, arc, at, cal, cat, chess (gnu), cmp, comm, compress, conquest, cron, dd, diff, ed, eroff, grep, head, indent, make, MicroEMACS, more, nroff, roff, sc, sed, sort, split, STEVIE, strings, sum, tail, tar, tee, ularn, uniq, vi, wanderer, wc, xmodem, ymodem, zmodem, zoo

Several messaging or bulletin board systems were written, including Usenet and Fidonet gateways, and many utilities to allow safe shell-level dial-up access.

Several computer languages were supported, including:

* BASIC
**Tiny BASIC
* C (HiTech C, and later gcc)
* Forth
* Lisp
* MUMPS
* 68000 assembly language

The collection of 1616/OS shareware eventually grew to thirty-one 800kB floppies. Included were innumerable small utilities and ported applications from other environments.

== The 1616 users group ==
Applix Pty Ltd started holding informal user group meetings in their Sydney store in 1987. The meetings were held on the second Saturday of the month, and often finished well after midnight after consumption of much pizza. Users brought their latest 1616-related creations to demonstrate and share, and discussion ranged from hardware design, operating system theory, language design, to politics and philosophy.

When the Mortons sold the shop in the 1990s, the meetings moved to their house at Yerrinbool, in the Southern Highlands, NSW. When the Mortons again moved to Wollongong, the meetings moved with them. Not able to escape the User Group by moving around NSW, the Mortons moved to Palo Alto, California in 2001.

The user group still meets on the second Saturday of every month, although it has been many years since an Applix 1616 has been booted at one, and, everyone being older, the meetings tend to end somewhat before midnight, and pizza is consumed in moderation.

<text>The Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP) is an art gallery, with both open-air and indoor exhibition spaces, in West Bretton, Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, England. It shows work by British and international artists, including Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. The sculpture park occupies the parkland of Bretton Hall.

==History==
The Yorkshire Sculpture Park, opened in 1977, was the UK&#x27;s first sculpture park based on the temporary open air exhibitions organised in London parks from the 1940s to 1970s by the Arts Council and London County Council (and later Greater London Council). The &#x27;gallery without walls&#x27; has a changing exhibition programme, rather than permanent display as seen in other UK sculpture parks such as Grizedale Forest.

==Exhibition spaces==
YSP has a number of settings where its collection is displayed. 

===Parkland===

The park is situated in the grounds of Bretton Hall, an 18th-century estate which was a family home until the mid-20th century when it became Bretton Hall College. Follies, landscape features and architectural structures from the 18th century can be seen around the park including the deer park and deer shelter (recently converted by American sculptor James Turrell into an installation), an ice house, and a camellia house. Artists working at YSP, such as Andy Goldsworthy in 2007, take their inspiration from its architectural, historical or natural environment.
Since the 1990s, YSP has made use of indoor exhibition spaces, initially a Bothy Gallery (in the curved Bothy Wall) and a temporary tent-like structure called the Pavilion Gallery. After an extensive refurbishment and expansion, YSP has added an underground gallery space in the Bothy garden, and exhibition spaces at Longside (the hillside facing the original park). Its programme consists of contemporary and modern sculpture (from Rodin and Bourdelle through to living artists). British sculpture is well represented in the past exhibition programme and semi-permanent installations. Many British sculptors prominent in the 1950s and 1960s have been the subject of solo exhibitions at YSP, including Lynn Chadwick, Austin Wright, Phillip King, Eduardo Paolozzi, Hans Josephsohn, and Kenneth Armitage. Exhibitions tend to be monographic – rather than group or thematic.

The redundant Grade II* listed St Bartholomew&#x27;s Chapel, West Bretton built by William Wentworth in 1744 has been restored as gallery space.

===Longside Gallery===
Longside Gallery is a space for sculpture overlooking YSP. The gallery is shared with the Arts Council Collection for an alternating programme of exhibitions. Between exhibitions, Longside Gallery is used for educational and outreach activities and events.

===The Weston===
In July 2019, the new visitor centre, housing a gallery, restaurant and shop, made the shortlist for the Stirling Prize for excellence in architecture.

<text>The Saab Bofors Dynamics NLAW (pronounced: , ), also known as the MBT LAW or RB 57, is a fire-and-forget, lightweight shoulder-fired, and disposable (single-use) line of sight (LOS) missile system, designed for infantry use. The missile uses a soft-launch system and is guided by predicted line of sight (PLOS). It can carry out an overfly top attack (OTA) on an armoured vehicle, or a direct attack (DA) on structures and non-armoured vehicles.

The system was developed in Sweden by prime contractor Saab Bofors Dynamics, on behalf of the British and Swedish defence authorities who procured the system in a joint venture. It was mainly produced in the United Kingdom by Team MBT LAW UK, which included 14 subcontractors, most notably Thales Air Defence. Users of the weapon include Finland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;NLAW&quot; initially referred to the original British development programme which Saab won the contract for with the &quot;MBT LAW&quot;. NLAW stands for &quot;Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon&quot; or &quot;Next-Generation Light Anti-armour Weapon&quot;. The N is short for &quot;Next generation&quot; or &quot;Next-generation&quot;, while LAW is an abbreviation of &quot;Light Anti-tank Weapon&quot; or &quot;Light Anti-Armour Weapon&quot;. MBT LAW stands for &quot;Main Battle Tank Light Anti-armour Weapon&quot;. NLAW has since development become the international designation of the weapon, while MBT LAW exists as a designation for the weapon in the British Army.

The name &quot;RB 57&quot; derives from the weapon&#x27;s designation in Swedish service – &quot;robot 57&quot; (&quot;guided missile 57&quot;) – which has the abbreviation &quot;rb 57&quot;. At times the specified form &quot;pansarvärnsrobot 57&quot; (&quot;anti-armour guided missile 57&quot;), &quot;pvrb 57&quot; for short, can also be found. The 5 indicates its missile class and the 7 indicates its consecutive number in that class (&quot;robot 57&quot; = 7th missile of the 5th class).

== Overview ==
In 1997, the British Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) began issuing invitations to tender for a new man-portable anti-tank weapon, to replace the obsolescent British LAW 80s. Swedish Bofors of the Celsius Group (later bought by Saab AB), American Lockheed Martin, and German Dynamit Nobel replied with offers; due to the limited spots of the NLAW-trials come January 2001, only the two former were rewarded with Project Definition Phase contracts in 1999. Bofors began development of the so-called MBT LAW the same year.
In May 2002, Saab Bofors Dynamics&#x27; MBT LAW was selected as winner over Matra BAe Dynamics&#x27; Kestrel (the British derivative of Lockheed Martin&#x27;s FGM-172 SRAW) in the NLAW-trials. In June, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the British DPA and the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), who also showed interest in the system. Accordingly, the NLAW-programme became a British–Swedish joint venture (primarily led by the DPA) assigned to Saab Bofors Dynamics (full development and production).

It was developed in Sweden and produced in the United Kingdom, with final assembly done by subcontractor Thales Air Defence. The contract signed in June 2002, between Saab and the two defence authorities, was worth approximately 4.8 billion SEK, including development and serial production; Sweden&#x27;s share in the serial production was estimated at one billion SEK.

With the finalising of agreements between Sweden and the United Kingdom in 2003, the development of the system continued until 2008, when it entered production in the UK. Deliveries of the weapon began in December 2008; it entered the service of the Swedish, Finnish and British armed forces the following year. It has been estimated that the UK requirement for the British Armed Forces was for 14,000 units, or more; it replaced the obsolescent LAW 80 system and the ILAW (AT4 CS) which was used as a substitute until its deployment. In 2005, the Swedish government placed a first order for 2,000 units from Saab. Finland has placed three orders between 2007 and 2017, for a total of 3,000 units. This was followed by Luxembourg, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Switzerland. As of 16 March 2022, the United Kingdom confirmed that it had delivered more than 4,000 of their NLAWs to the Ukrainian military, to be used against Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Development ===
Research for a new Swedish light anti-tank guided missile began in the 1990s by the Swedish Armed Forces, for its mechanized infantry which were lacking both tanks and anti-tank warfare weapons. Initially, the project focused on creating as simple and cost-effective a system as possible; after some analysis, the need for a man-portable anti-tank weapon with great effectiveness at short to mid-range emerged.

In October 1999, the British DPA awarded Bofors (later Saab Bofors Dynamics) with a product definition order to procure a weapon prototype within 22 months, corresponding to the requirements of the British NLAW-programme: To be able to hit a moving target at and a stationary target at , with a maximum weight of ; some of the requirements later made by the Swedish FMV were a lowered backblast area, a minimum effective range of 20 metres, and an environmental adaptation for international operations. Saab Bofors Dynamics, the DPA, and the FMV each paid a third of the assessment-phase cost for the MBT LAW, of £18 million. The FMV invested additional money during the NLAW-trials, while the DPA ceased further funding until a contract was signed.

The project gained momentum in 2002–2003 after being selected by the British and Swedish defence authorities, meeting the demanding requirements from both nations. Both launcher and missile development was done by Saab Bofors Dynamics in Eskilstuna and Karlskoga, Sweden, using technology derived from earlier Bofors systems; such as the RBS 56B BILL 2 (warhead and guidance) and AT4 CS (confined space capability), as well as some further developments. The United Kingdom and Sweden shared the development costs. Full production and delivery was expected to begin by the end of 2006, with the development phase &quot;nearing its end&quot; in 2005 according to Nick Moore (DPA). However, as a result of qualification failures in the tests of November 2006, it was delayed until 2008. Due to the similar requirements made by the Swedish and British defence authorities, the weapon comes with only minor differences in appearance. It uses a single shaped-charge warhead, as opposed to other comparable missiles that have a tandem warhead.

Saab, who also develops the system software, announced in 2015 that they had been able to optimise the guidance system by fine-tuning its &quot;predicted line of sight&quot;. An effective range of and up against stationary targets was demonstrated in April 2014. An effective range of against moving targets has also been reported.

=== Production ===

As jobs are often the focus of large material orders, a requirement by the British DPA for signing a contract with the winner was that the production of the system would occur in the United Kingdom. For this reason, Saab Bofors Dynamics contracted UK-based Thales Air Defence ahead of the NLAW-programme—while Lockheed Martin contracted Matra BAe Dynamics. To produce the system, Saab and Thales went on to create Team MBT LAW UK which included 14 subcontractors. As per the agreements signed between the United Kingdom and Sweden in 2002–2003, manufacturing occurred mostly in the UK, with final assembly and test done at the Thales Air Defence facilities in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The weapon went into full production in 2008. The final cost for the MBT LAW contract since the beginning of the NLAW-programme, including the assessment phase, development, and manufacture-license, ended up at approximately £400–437 million.

Team MBT LAW UK, which provided components for the system, included: Thales Air Defence (final assembly); BAE Systems Avionics (inertial measurement unit); NP Aerospace (plastic and composite mouldings); FR-HiTemp (control fins and actuators); Raytheon Systems (electronics assemblies); Skeldings (special purpose springs); Thales Missile Electronics (proximity fuze); MetalWeb; BAE Systems RO Defence; EPS Logistics Technology; Express Engineering; Portsmouth Aviation; ICI Nobel Enterprises; Leafield Engineering. The missile&#x27;s warhead is made in Switzerland by Saab Bofors Dynamics Switzerland Ltd.

More than 24,200 units have been produced. Depending on which source, it costs: £20,000 (2008); US$30,000 (2022); US$33,000 (2022); US$40,000 (2022). Each unit has a shelf life of around 20 years.

=== Operation ===

The NLAW is a man-portable, soft-launch, and confined-spaces (saltwater countermass) system, allowing the missile to be fired from almost anywhere; the operator can safely fire through any window of a room no bigger than 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 m (high). The missile is first shot out of the launcher with a low-powered ignition system, after which its main rocket ignites and propels it to the target. Guidance uses a predicted line of sight (PLOS) system. For a moving target, the operator maintains tracking for at least 2–3 seconds. The software embedded in the missile&#x27;s INS records the operator&#x27;s aiming movement and extrapolates the flight path needed to intercept the target. After launch, the missile flies autonomously along the pre-programmed flight path, controlled by an inertial guidance system. The system weighs , with a rocket weight of ; the mass of the warhead is . It is unnecessary for the operator to consider the target distance (so long as it is within range), or to stay exposed whilst the missile is in the air (fire-and-forget).

Against tanks and other armoured vehicles, the overfly top attack (OTA) mode is used; the missile flies about one metre above the line of sight, detonating the warhead above the target&#x27;s weaker top armour via proximity fuze and magnetic sensors. The exact way in which the &quot;combined magnetic and optical sensors&quot; ensure the proper detonation of the warhead is classified. The direct attack (DA) mode is used against non-armoured targets, detonating the warhead on impact via contact fuze as the missile flies on the line of sight. The launcher can be fired only once and is disposed of after use. The operator can adjust the arming distance of the missile, to avoid a premature detonation triggered by the sensors when it flies over non-targets. They can also fire down or up at a 45-degree angle. The method of exploding above the tank by one metre was met with scepticism at the time. Saab had to work hard to show that they could make the system work. Saab NLAW designer Christer Nygren said: “The protection on main battle tanks was increasing all the time...We saw that we needed a new type of attack. But, with the over-the-top attack, you create another technical challenge, which is how to hit vertically down through the roof of the tank when the velocity of the missile is in the forward direction. It’s a tricky thing. Before any contracts were signed we had to present a lot of technical evidence that we could really defeat a tank from the top and get the warhead [to detonate] at the right time.” Saab claims that in 20 years the US designers have not matched the NLAW system&#x27;s technology. Adding &quot;You give them an hour of training and they can fight the T-90 [the most advanced Russian tank] without a problem.” The missile will auto-destruct at the maximum flight time of 5.6 seconds, which is about . It is designed to operate in all climate conditions and environments, from −38 to +63 degrees Celsius.

== Combat history ==

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===

Preceding the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom supplied 2,000 NLAW systems to Ukraine, with another 1,615 delivered by 9 March 2022 to bolster Ukraine&#x27;s military. More NLAWs were requested by the Ukrainian military following reports that they proved highly effective against Russian vehicles, leading to at least 100 more being allocated by Luxembourg. Alongside US FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile systems, delivered as a precaution against increased hostilities, the Ukrainian forces reported that NLAWs produced far greater damage against Russian armoured vehicles than their standard Soviet-era equipment. On 24 March 2022, the UK pledged to deliver a further 6,000 NLAWs and a senior Ukrainian military officer also claimed they were the &quot;weapon of choice&quot; for his troops, responsible for 30–40% of Russian tanks destroyed.
An unknown number of launchers were captured by the armed forces of Russia and the pro-Russian self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic during the conflict. A number of these captured weapons were reportedly transferred to Iran as part of a deal to acquire drones.

NLAWs were the most numerous advanced guided anti-tank missile in Ukraine as of April 2022.

<doc id="1031793" wikidata="Q48892" url="?curid=1031793" title="Didier Drogba">
<text>Didier Yves Drogba Tébily (; born 11 March 1978) is an Ivorian former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is the all-time top scorer and former captain of the Ivory Coast national team. He is known for his career at Chelsea, where he is the club’s top goalscorer as a foreign player and is currently the club&#x27;s fourth highest goalscorer of all time. In 2012, Drogba was named Chelsea&#x27;s greatest ever player in a poll of 20,000 fans conducted by Chelsea Magazine. In 2020, he was named in the Chelsea team of the 2010–2020 decade. Widely regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time, he was known for his pace, aerial abilities, and powerful and accurate strikes. Drogba was named African Footballer of the Year twice (2006 and 2009).

After playing in youth teams, Drogba made his debut into football at the age of 21 for Ligue 2 club Le Mans. After finishing the 2002–03 season with 17 goals in 34 appearances for Ligue 1 side Guingamp, he moved to Olympique de Marseille, where he finished as the third highest goalscorer in the 2003–04 season with 19 goals and helped the club reach the 2004 UEFA Cup Final.

In July 2004, Drogba moved to Premier League club Chelsea for £24 million, making him the most expensive Ivorian player of all time. In his debut season, he helped Chelsea win their first league title in 50 years along with another Premier League title a year later. He was named in the 2007 FIFA World XI. In March 2012, he became the first African player to score 100 Premier League goals. Two months later, he scored in Chelsea&#x27;s 2012 FA Cup Final win over Liverpool to become the first player to score in four FA Cup finals. He also played in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, where he scored an 88th-minute equaliser and the winning penalty in the penalty shootout against Bayern Munich. After spending six months with Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, he moved to Turkish club Galatasaray, where he scored the winning goal in the final of the 2013 Turkish Super Cup. Drogba returned to Chelsea in July 2014. With a record of scoring 10 goals in 10 finals, Drogba is referred to as the &quot;ultimate big game player&quot;. He joined Canadian club Montreal Impact in 2015 as a designated player and played 41 matches over two seasons, scoring 23 goals. Drogba became a player and owner of Phoenix Rising in the United Soccer League in 2017 and retired a year later at the age of 40. On 21 April 2022, he was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame.

Drogba made his debut for Ivory Coast in 2002 and became the captain in 2006. He is the nation&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer with 65 goals in 105 appearances. He led the Ivory Coast to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their first appearance in the tournament, and scored their first goal. He captained Ivory Coast at the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. He led Ivory Coast to two Africa Cup of Nations finals in 2006 and 2012, though they lost on penalties on both occasions. On 8 August 2014, he announced his retirement from international football.

Drogba played a vital role in solving issues in his home country and in Africa. In 2007, he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme. In December 2018, he became Vice President of the international organization Peace and Sport.

== Early life ==
Drogba is a member of the Bété people. He was born in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and at the age of five was sent to France by his parents to live with his uncle, Michel Goba, a professional footballer. However, Drogba soon became homesick and returned to Abidjan after three years. His mother nicknamed him &quot;Tito&quot;, after president Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, whom she admired greatly. He played football every day in a car park in the city, but his return to the Ivory Coast was short-lived. Both of his parents lost their jobs and he again returned to live with his uncle. In 1991, his parents also travelled to France; first to Vannes and then, in 1993, settling in Antony in the Paris suburbs, at which point the 15-year-old Drogba returned to live with them and his siblings. It was here that he began playing team football more frequently, joining a local youth side. Drogba then joined the semi-professional club Levallois, gaining a reputation as a prolific scorer in the youth team and impressing the coach with his professional attitude. His performances earned him a place in the senior squad but despite scoring in his debut, the 18-year-old Ivorian failed to make an impression on Jacques Loncar, the first team coach.

== Club career ==
=== Le Mans ===
When Drogba finished school he moved to the city Le Mans to study accountancy at university and changed clubs, becoming an apprentice at Ligue 2 club Le Mans. However, his first two years there were marred by injuries and he was physically struggling to cope with the training and match schedule. Former Le Mans coach Marc Westerloppe later remarked that &quot;it took Didier four years to be capable of training every day and playing every week&quot;. Furthermore, Drogba had never attended a football academy and only began daily football training as an adult.

By age 21, Drogba realised that he had to establish himself as a player soon or else he would have little chance of becoming a professional footballer. He made his first team debut for Le Mans soon thereafter and signed his first professional contract in 1999. The same year, he and his Malian wife Alla had their first child, Isaac. He grew into his new responsibilities, later stating: &quot;Isaac&#x27;s birth was a turning point in my life, it straightened me out&quot;. His first season, in which he scored seven goals in thirty games, boded well for the future, but during the following season he did not live up to expectations. Drogba lost his place to Daniel Cousin due to injury, then upon his return, he failed to score throughout the remainder of the season. However, he returned to form the following season, scoring five goals in 21 appearances.

=== Guingamp ===
Halfway through the 2001–02 season Ligue 1 club Guingamp consolidated months of interest with a transfer offer and Drogba left Le Mans for a fee of £80,000.
The second half of the 2001–02 season saw Drogba make 11 appearances and score three goals for Guingamp. While his contributions helped the club avoid relegation, the coaching staff remained unconvinced of their new young striker. However, the next season he rewarded his coaches&#x27; patience, scoring 17 goals in 34 appearances and helping Guingamp finish seventh, a record league finish. He credited his teammates for his impressive season, highlighting the contributions of winger Florent Malouda, a long time friend of Drogba, as a key factor in his goalscoring prolificity that season. His strong goal scoring record attracted interest from larger clubs and at the end of the season, he moved to Ligue 1 side Olympique de Marseille for a fee of £3.3 million.

=== Marseille ===
Olympique de Marseille completed the signing of Didier Drogba on 30 June 2003. The Ivorian striker played his first match in his new colours on 2 August 2003, during the first matchday of the 2003–2004 season against his former club, Guingamp. Drogba had a season in which he emerged as one of the highest European scorers. He has notably scored 19 league goals, winning the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Player of the Year award. He also scored 11 goals in European competitions, five goals in UEFA Champions League and six in the UEFA Cup. 

At the end of the season, Drogba was a transfer priority of newly endorsed Chelsea coach José Mourinho, and was bought as the club&#x27;s then record signing of £24 million. His shirt from his only season at Marseille is also framed in the basilica of the city, Notre-Dame de la Garde, which he presented to the church before the 2004 UEFA Cup Final.

=== Chelsea ===
==== 2004–06 ====
Signing for Chelsea in July 2004 for £24 million, he became the club&#x27;s record signing and the most expensive striker in English domestic football. Drogba scored in his third game for the club with a header against Crystal Palace. His season was interrupted when he pulled a stomach muscle against Liverpool which kept him out of action for over two months. Chelsea won the Premier League, only their second English top-flight championship and their first in 50 years, and the League Cup. Later, Drogba scored in extra time in a 3–2 final win against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. Drogba scored a somewhat disappointing 16 goals in a total of 40 games for Chelsea in his first season: ten in the Premier League, five in the Champions League and one in the League Cup final.

Drogba started the 2005–06 season by scoring two goals in a Community Shield win over Arsenal. His reputation was marred amidst accusations of cheating during Chelsea&#x27;s 2–0 win over Manchester City. Replays showed that he had used his hand to control the ball before scoring the second of his two goals. This occurred just a week after a similar incident against Fulham where the goal was disallowed.
Chelsea went on to retain the league title with two games to play, becoming only the second club to win back-to-back English titles in the Premier League era. Again Drogba finished with 16 goals for the season, 12 in the Premier League, two in the Community Shield, one in the Champions League and one in the FA Cup.

==== 2006–07 ====

After the departure of Damien Duff to Newcastle United, Drogba switched from the number 15 shirt he had worn for Chelsea since 2004 to the number 11 shirt vacated by Duff. Drogba scored 33 goals in all competitions during the season (more than his tally in the previous two seasons combined), including 20 in the Premier League to win the Golden Boot. In doing so, he became the first Chelsea player since Kerry Dixon in 1984–85 to reach 30 goals in a season, scoring 20 in the Premier League, six in the Champions League, three in the FA Cup and four in the League Cup.

Among the highlights were scoring game-winners from outside the penalty area against Liverpool, Everton (from 35 yards out) and Barcelona, a 93rd-minute equaliser against Barcelona at the Camp Nou and both Chelsea&#x27;s goals in their 2–1 League Cup final win over Arsenal. His goal against Liverpool saw him control the ball on his chest with his back to goal, before hitting a 20-yard half-volley on the turn. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher who was closely marking Drogba said, &quot;There&#x27;s not a lot you can do in certain situations because they were that good.&quot; He also completed two hat-tricks; one against Watford and the other against Levski Sofia in the Champions League, Chelsea&#x27;s first hat-trick in European competition since Gianluca Vialli in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1997. In his last competitive game that season, he scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium. This also meant he became the only player to score in both English domestic finals in the same season and win both.

In January 2007, Drogba was named the Ivorian Player of the Year, ahead of Kader Keïta, Aruna Dindane, and Kolo Touré. In March, he was named African Footballer of the Year for the first time, ahead of Samuel Eto&#x27;o and Chelsea teammate Michael Essien. His performances during the season saw him named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and runner-up to Cristiano Ronaldo in the PFA Player of the Year awards.

Drogba faced problems off the pitch during the end of the season as his transfer from Marseille to Chelsea in July 2004 came under scrutiny. The Stevens inquiry in June 2007 expressed concerns because of the lack of co-operation from agents Pinhas Zahavi and Barry Silkman.

==== 2007–08 ====

The 2007–08 season began badly for Drogba as he expressed his doubts about the departure of manager José Mourinho. He was reportedly in tears when Mourinho told him he was leaving the club, and said &quot;Mourinho&#x27;s departure destroys a certain familiarity we had at the club. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation&quot;. Following these claims, Drogba told &quot;France Football&quot; magazine &quot;I want to leave Chelsea. Something is broken with Chelsea, The damage is big in the dressing room&quot;. Despite having signed a four-year contract with the club in 2006, Drogba reportedly pointed out several favoured clubs in the interview, identifying Barcelona, Real Madrid, A.C. Milan or Inter Milan as possible future destinations, he later admitted he regretted this and was 100% committed to Chelsea. Drogba made it up to the fans by scoring in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–0 victory over Middlesbrough on 20 October 2007, against Schalke 04 in the Champions League four days later, and two goals against Manchester City. In December 2007, Drogba was voted fourth (after Kaká, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year.

Drogba continued scoring goals but suffered an injury at the training ground and decided to have an operation on his knee. He was unable to play for four weeks and missed key games against Valencia, Arsenal and Liverpool. Drogba returned from injury to play in an FA Cup third round match against Queens Park Rangers and wore the captain&#x27;s armband for the last 30 minutes he was on the pitch, but that was his last performance for Chelsea before international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. Upon his return, Drogba scored a goal in the 2008 League Cup Final, making him the all-time leading scorer in League Cup Finals with four goals, but could not help prevent Chelsea fall to a 2–1 defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur. He scored both goals in a key 2–1 victory against Arsenal on 23 March 2008, bringing Chelsea equal on points with leaders Manchester United.
On 26 April 2008, Drogba faced controversy after a clash with Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidić. The Serbian centre-back had to have stitches under his lip after losing a tooth in the clash. There was discussion whether Drogba had the intention or not to injure his rival. The debate also called into question an earlier incident on 26 November 2006 where Drogba elbowed Vidić. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed concerns over elbowing in the Premier League. Despite media speculation, Drogba&#x27;s yellow card for the clash was deemed adequate punishment by the Football Association.

Controversy still dogged the player as before the UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg clash with Liverpool, Drogba was accused of diving by Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez. Benítez claimed to have compiled a four-year dossier of Drogba&#x27;s &quot;diving&quot; antics but Drogba hit back at Benítez in an interview. On 30 April 2008, Drogba scored two goals in the second leg of the semi-final against Liverpool, which Chelsea won 3–2 at Stamford Bridge. This was the first time Chelsea had beaten Liverpool in the semi-finals of the Champions League, having lost their previous two meetings to Liverpool. This also led to Chelsea reaching their first Champions League Final. Drogba became Chelsea&#x27;s top scorer in European competition, the two goals he scored put his total at 17, surpassing Peter Osgood&#x27;s record of 16. Drogba was sent off in the 117th minute of the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United for slapping defender Vidić, becoming only the second player to be sent off in a European Cup final – after Jens Lehmann in 2006 – and the first for violent conduct. Chelsea went on to lose 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in extra time. Chelsea assistant boss Henk ten Cate revealed Drogba was due to take the decisive fifth spot-kick in the shootout. Team captain John Terry took his place but missed after slipping whilst taking the penalty.

==== 2008–09 ====

Drogba suffered a string of injuries early on in the 2008–09 season and struggled to regain fitness, missing games from August to November due to knee problems. He scored his first goal of the season in mid-November but there was little reason to celebrate: he incurred disciplinary action and a three-match ban for throwing a coin back into the stands and Chelsea suffered a League Cup defeat against Burnley. Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2–1 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League, while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2–0 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008. Having missed many games through injury and suspension, Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two. However, he resolved to regain his position in the squad.

Upon the temporary appointment of Guus Hiddink in early February following the sacking of Scolari, Drogba enjoyed a rejuvenation of sorts, returning to his goal-scoring form with four goals in five games after the new manager took over. His revival in form saw him net twice against Bolton Wanderers, and four times in four Champions League matches, one in each leg of the last sixteen and quarter-final of the competition against Juventus and Liverpool respectively, with these goals ensuring Chelsea&#x27;s passage into the semi-finals. Just four days after his Champions League games, Drogba scored a late goal in the FA Cup semi-final match against Arsenal after Frank Lampard&#x27;s pass found Drogba and he carefully rounded Arsenal goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański before passing the ball into Arsenal&#x27;s empty net. Drogba also caused controversy after Chelsea&#x27;s Champions League semi-final defeat at the hands of Barcelona. Feeling that many decisions had gone against Chelsea, substituted Drogba confronted referee Tom Henning Øvrebø after the final whistle. He received a yellow card in the process and was recorded shouting &quot;It&#x27;s a fucking disgrace&quot; into a live television camera. On 17 June 2009, UEFA subsequently handed him a six-game European ban with the final two games suspended. The ban then was reduced by one match after an appeal by Chelsea. In the 2009 FA Cup Final, Drogba scored Chelsea&#x27;s first and equalising goal as they went on to win 2–1. This was his sixth goal in a major cup final in England. Although Drogba had previously expressed his desire to switch clubs, he decided to remain with the Blues under new coach Carlo Ancelotti and signed a new contract.

==== 2009–10 ====

Drogba began the 2009–10 season in fine form for Chelsea, netting a penalty during a shoot-out win in the Community Shield over Manchester United, before scoring twice in a 2–1 victory over Hull City. Drogba earned himself an assist when he was fouled in the penalty box to give Chelsea a penalty, which Frank Lampard converted, in a 3–1 victory over Sunderland. In Chelsea&#x27;s third game of the season against West-London rivals Fulham, Drogba scored his third goal of the season. Drogba scored his fourth goal of the season, against Stoke City; Chelsea ended winning the game 2–1 with a late strike from Malouda. He added a fifth at home against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 20 September.

He scored his 100th goal for Chelsea in a 3–1 defeat against Wigan Athletic. Drogba was again important in the 2–0 win over title rivals Liverpool on 4 October. He assisted both goals, setting up Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda. He then scored a glancing header against Blackburn on 24 October 2009, bringing his tally to eight goals in eleven appearances, scoring his third goal in as many games. Drogba continued his fine form scoring a header against Bolton Wanderers in a 4–0 win in the League Cup, Drogba went on to score a goal in the same week with another 4–0 win against Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League.

After missing the first three Champions League matches for Chelsea with a ban for being unsportsmanlike, Drogba started the fourth game against Spanish side Atlético Madrid. He scored two goals in the last ten minutes and the match ended 2–2. On 29 November, Drogba scored a goal against London rivals Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, the second of which a free kick from outside the box. It brought his tally for the season to 14 goals in 16 games. On 12 December, Drogba continued his performance with two goals in 3–3 draw against Everton. Between 3 and 30 January Drogba was on Africa Cup of Nations duty and came back on 2 February against Hull City where he scored a 40th-minute equaliser to tie the game 1–1. On 24 March, Drogba scored his 30th goal of the season in an away game against Portsmouth.
On 9 May, Drogba helped Chelsea to win the Premier League by scoring a hat-trick in an 8–0 win over Wigan Athletic. In doing so, he not only collected his third League winner&#x27;s medal but also won the Golden Boot for the season, his second time doing so, by topping the chart with 29 league goals, beating Wayne Rooney to the title who remained on 26 goals. Both players had the same number of goals (26) before the start of their respective matches. However, during the game, Drogba appeared to be clearly angry with teammate and regular penalty taker Frank Lampard, after Lampard refused to let Drogba take a penalty which would lead Chelsea to go 2–0 up and give him a chance of winning the golden boot. Lampard scored the penalty, but Drogba did not celebrate with his teammates. Later on in the game though Ashley Cole was tripped in the box when Chelsea were already 5–0 up, and this time Lampard allowed Drogba to take the penalty, which he scored to go two goals clear of Rooney.

The following week, Drogba scored the only goal of the 2010 FA Cup Final against Portsmouth from a free-kick, keeping up his record of having scored in all six English cup finals (FA Cup and League Cup) in which he has played.

==== 2010–11 ====

Drogba came on as a substitute for Anelka against Manchester United in the Community Shield, but could not help prevent Chelsea from succumbing to a 3–1 loss. However, he started the Premier League season in fine form, continuing from where he left off on the last day of the previous campaign as he scored a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 6–0 victory. In Chelsea&#x27;s next game against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, Drogba made three assists in another 6–0 win.

Drogba played the next game at home against Stoke City where he lasted the whole 90 minutes and scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season when he kicked home a penalty after Nicolas Anelka was brought down by Thomas Sørensen inside the box. On 7 November 2010, Drogba missed the first half of Chelsea&#x27;s 2–0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. It was later revealed that he had been suffering from malaria for at least a month. He had first complained of feeling unwell before the October 2010 international break but the illness was only diagnosed on 8 November 2010. Having diagnosed the problem, Chelsea insisted that he would make a full recovery within days.

==== 2011–12 ====

While playing against Norwich City on 27 August 2011, Drogba suffered a concussion in a collision with Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy. After missing two games, Drogba made his return to the Chelsea squad on 24 September against Swansea City. Drogba went on scoring his first goal of the season in a 4–1 win. On 29 November, Drogba rejected a new deal with Chelsea and was set to sign for the highest bidder. On 31 December 2011, Drogba scored his 150th goal for Chelsea against Aston Villa, putting him level with Peter Osgood and Roy Bentley in terms of the club&#x27;s top scorers of all time. Even though, Chelsea was leading with the penalty scored by Drobga, the game ended in a 3–1 loss for Chelsea. Drogba scored his 99th Premier League goal for Chelsea on 25 February 2012, in a 3–0 win over Bolton Wanderers. Drogba scored his 100th Premier League goal for Chelsea on 10 March 2012, in a 1–0 win over Stoke City. He is the first African player to reach that landmark.
Drogba scored his seventh goal at Wembley Stadium against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 15 April, blasting the ball past former teammate Carlo Cudicini as Chelsea became 5–1 winners and secured a place in the FA Cup Final against Liverpool. Three days later, he scored a vital goal as Chelsea beat Barcelona 1–0 at Stamford Bridge in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League Semi-final clash. Drogba became the first player to score in four different FA Cup Finals, as he netted the winner in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–1 triumph over Liverpool on 5 May. Drogba also holds the record for most goals scored at the new Wembley Stadium with eight.

In the Champions League final against Bayern Munich on 19 May 2012, with Chelsea finding themselves 1–0 down, Drogba scored the equaliser from Juan Mata&#x27;s corner in the 88th minute, taking the game into extra time, where he then gave away a penalty for Bayern after fouling Franck Ribéry in the box; former teammate Arjen Robben&#x27;s shot was saved by Petr Čech. The game went to a penalty shootout, where he scored the winning penalty to give Chelsea their first Champions League trophy. Sir Alex Ferguson remarked: &quot;As far as I was concerned, he [Drogba] won the Champions League for Chelsea.&quot; Drogba&#x27;s headed effort marked his ninth goal in nine cup final appearances for Chelsea, Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola spoke after the match about Drogba&#x27;s ability in big games: &quot;In all their very important matches he has put a stamp on it.&quot; In November 2012, Drogba was named Chelsea&#x27;s greatest ever player in a poll of 20,000 fans conducted by &quot;Chelsea FC Magazine&quot;.

=== Shanghai Shenhua ===

On 22 May 2012, Chelsea released a note on their official website announcing that Drogba would leave the club when his contract expired at the end of June 2012. On 19 June 2012, Drogba declared he would be joining Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua, linking up with his former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka. It was reported that he signed a two-and-a-half-year deal where he would earn £200,000 a week. On 22 July, Drogba made his debut for Shanghai Shenhua in a 1–1 away draw against Guangzhou R&amp;F, coming on as a substitute for Brazilian defender Moisés in the second half. He assisted Cao Yunding&#x27;s equaliser in the 67th minute. On 4 August, he scored his first two goals in a 5–1 win against Hangzhou Greentown. He scored two more goals on 25 August, both set up by Anelka, as Shenhua drew 3–3 with Shandong Luneng.

=== Galatasaray ===
On 28 January 2013, Drogba agreed to a one-and-a-half-year deal with Süper Lig team Galatasaray. He would earn a sign-on fee of €4 million plus basic wage of €4 million per season, €2 million for the remaining 2012–13 Süper Lig and €15,000 per match. However, on 30 January 2013, Shenhua released a press release that Drogba would unilaterally breach his contract if he were to join Galatasaray.
Drogba argued that he had not been paid his wages by the club and asked FIFA, the sport&#x27;s governing body, to invalidate his contract. In February 2013, FIFA granted a temporary license for him to play for Galatasaray pending the outcome of the contract dispute.

On 15 February, Drogba scored his debut goal for Galatasaray just five minutes after coming off the bench against Akhisar Belediyespor in a match that ended 2–1. On 9 April, Drogba scored his first goal for Galatasaray in the Champions League quarter-final game, against Real Madrid. On 20 April, Drogba scored twice in a match against Elazigspor that ended 3–1.

He won his first title with Galatasaray on 5 May, with a 4–2 win over Sivasspor. In Galatasary&#x27;s derby match against Istanbul rivals Fenerbahçe on 12 May, Drogba and his Ivorian teammate Emmanuel Eboue were subjects of racist chants from opposing fans in the team&#x27;s 2–1 loss, but no fine or bans were handed down to the supporters or the club. On 11 August, he scored the only goal in the 2013 Turkish Super Cup against the same opponents, and he scored two second-half goals in a 2–1 away win against fellow city rivals Beşiktaş on 22 September, although the match was abandoned due to hooliganism from fans of the opponents.

=== Return to Chelsea ===

On 25 July 2014, Chelsea announced on their official website that Drogba completed his return to the club on a free transfer, and signed a one-year contract. Speaking on his move back to the club, Drogba said: Mourinho also commented on the transfer, saying: &quot;He&#x27;s coming because he&#x27;s one of the best strikers in Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he&#x27;s not protected by history or what he&#x27;s done for this club previously. He is coming with the mentality to make more history.&quot; On 28 July 2014, Chelsea announced that Drogba would wear the number 15 shirt which he wore when he first signed for the club in 2004. Mohamed Salah, who wore the number during the 2013–14 season, took over the number 17 shirt vacated by Eden Hazard. On 15 August, however, it was announced that Drogba had been given back the number 11 shirt he previously wore at the club, with its previous occupant Oscar taking over the number 8 jersey vacated by Frank Lampard.

Drogba made his Premier League return for Chelsea in a 3–1 win away to Burnley, replacing winger Eden Hazard in the 84th minute at Turf Moor on 18 August 2014. On 17 September he made the first start of his second spell, in a 1–1 home draw against Schalke 04 in Chelsea&#x27;s first game of the Champions League group stage. He scored his first goal in his second spell at Stamford Bridge on 21 October, converting a penalty kick in a 6–0 win over Maribor in the Champions League. Five days later, with Chelsea&#x27;s attack limited by injuries to Diego Costa and Loïc Rémy, Drogba started against Manchester United at Old Trafford, making his 350th appearance for the club. Early in the second-half, he headed in the first Premier League goal of his second spell although Robin van Persie equalised in added time. He scored his 50th goal in European football against Schalke 04.

On 24 May 2015, Drogba announced that Chelsea&#x27;s final game of the season against Sunderland would be his last as a Chelsea player. He started the game as captain and was substituted with injury after half an hour, being carried off by his teammates in an eventual 3–1 win. Drogba&#x27;s final total of 104 goals was the most by an African in Premier League history until it was surpassed by Liverpool and Egypt forward Mohamed Salah in 2021.

=== Montreal Impact ===
On 27 July 2015, Drogba signed a Designated Player contract with Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact, believed to be 18 months in length. On 23 August, he made his debut in a 0–1 home loss against the Philadelphia Union, coming on as a substitute for Dilly Duka in the second half. On 5 September, Drogba scored a hat-trick on his first MLS start, the first player to do so in the league&#x27;s history. Additionally, it was considered a &quot;perfect hat-trick&quot;, with one goal scored with either foot and one with the head. He was September&#x27;s MLS Player of the Month after scoring 7 goals in his first 5 games in the league.
On 25 October, he scored both of the Impact&#x27;s goals from back heels as the team came from behind to defeat Toronto FC 2–1 at home in the Canadian Classique; the win gave Montreal the home advantage for their knock-out fixture against Toronto in the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs. Drogba finished the 2015 MLS regular season with 11 goals in 11 games. On 29 October, Drogba scored Montreal&#x27;s third goal in a 3–0 home win over Toronto in the knock-out round of the Playoffs, to advance to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals for the first time in the club&#x27;s history; they were eliminated by Columbus Crew SC. He was named one of the three finalists for the 2015 MLS Newcomer of the Year Award.

During the MLS offseason, recently appointed Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink revealed interest in bringing on Drogba in a short-term coaching capacity after Drogba made a visit to Stamford Bridge to watch a Chelsea match with Hiddink and owner Roman Abramovich. Montreal then reiterated their intent for Drogba to finish his contract with the club, but were left uncertain until Drogba publicly confirmed his intent to play with Montreal for the 2016 MLS season on 3 March 2016. After beginning his preseason training in Qatar away from the club, Drogba joined the Impact for the second half of their preseason training in St. Petersburg, Florida. On 3 March, club technical director Adam Braz announced that Drogba would not play matches on artificial turf to begin the season due to possible implications on his knee.

In July 2016, Drogba was included in the roster for the 2016 MLS All-Star Game, scoring in a 2–1 defeat to Arsenal on 28 July. On 14 October, following his exclusion from the starting lineup of a match against Toronto FC by manager Mauro Biello, Drogba refused to play for the team that night, removing his name from the squad. With both his fitness, due to a lingering back injury, and his role in the team in question, Drogba did not travel with the team to, although he was in attendance at, their first postseason match at D.C. United, a 4–2 victory on 27 October. Drogba did not experience the same level of success in his second regular season compared to the first, but still scored 10 goals while appearing in only 22 games, as Montreal reached the Conference Final of the 2016 Playoffs.

=== Phoenix Rising ===
On 12 April 2017, after nearly four months as a free agent and declining a move to Brazilian side Corinthians, Drogba signed for USL side Phoenix Rising FC. He also became a minority owner of the club, making him the first player-owner in football history.

He made his debut for the club on 10 June 2017, and scored a goal and an assist, leading the team to a 2–1 victory over Vancouver Whitecaps FC 2. In July 2017 Drogba attracted attention after scoring an impressive last-minute free kick in a game against Orange County to tie the game. On 7 August, he scored with a powerful 40-yard free kick against LA Galaxy reserve side which was followed by his classic knee-slide goal celebration in front of the bench. In November 2018, at the age of 40, Drogba scored against Orange County as Phoenix won the USL Western Conference. On 8 November, Phoenix lost the USL Championship game 1–0 at Louisville City FC. Drogba retired later that month at the age of 40, but remained with his final club to work on their bid to join MLS.

== International career ==

As the talisman of the team Drogba contributed to the Ivory Coast qualifying for its first ever FIFA World Cup, held in Germany in 2006. Following the victory over Sudan that clinched World Cup qualification he also played a pivotal role in helping to end the Ivorian civil war by making an impassioned speech to the camera which resulted in a cease fire.

In February 2006, Drogba captained the Ivory Coast to their second Africa Cup of Nations final, scoring the only goal in their semi-final match with Nigeria and putting away the deciding spot-kick in their record-tying 12–11 penalty shootout quarter-final win over Cameroon. However, they lost in the final to Egypt 4–2 on penalty kicks after a 0–0 draw, with Drogba&#x27;s shot being stopped by Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El Hadary.

At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Ivory Coast were drawn in a &quot;group of death&quot; with Serbia and Montenegro, the Netherlands and Argentina. On 10 June 2006, Drogba scored the first World Cup goal of his career and of his country&#x27;s history in the opening game against Argentina, but his team lost 2–1. The Ivory Coast were eliminated from the World Cup after their next game, a 2–1 defeat to the Netherlands, but came from 0–2 down to win against Serbia and Montenegro 3–2 in their final group game, with Drogba watching from the sidelines following suspension after picking up a yellow card in the previous two games.

In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, the Ivory Coast were drawn in a group with Nigeria, Mali and underdogs Benin. Drogba scored two goals in the group stage, opening the scoring in the 4–1 win over Benin, as well as in the 3–0 win over Mali. In the quarter-finals, Drogba was on the score sheet once again in the 5–0 win over Guinea with the last four goals coming in the final twenty minutes. The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 final against Egypt, but it was to be the end of the road for Drogba and the Ivory Coast, losing 4–1 to the eventual champions. On 9 February, Drogba lost 4–2 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.

Drogba scored six goals in five qualification games to help the Ivory Coast qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
In the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations Drogba scored one goal in the 3–1 victory against Ghana in the group stage. The Ivory Coast reached the quarter-finals but lost 2–3 to Algeria. In March 2010, he was named as the 2009 African Footballer of the Year, his second time winning the award in his career.

On 4 June 2010, Drogba was injured in a friendly match with Japan. He received the injury in a high challenge from defender Túlio Tanaka. He fractured the ulna in his right arm and had an operation the next day in the hope of making the finals. On 15 June 2010, Drogba was cleared by FIFA to play in the Ivory Coast&#x27;s first group game against Portugal wearing a protective cast on his broken arm. The match ended in a goalless draw at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium with Drogba coming on in the 65th minute. On 20 June 2010, Drogba became the first player from an African nation to score against Brazil in a World Cup match, scoring with a header in the 78th minute as the Ivory Coast were defeated 1–3. On 25 June 2010, the Ivory Coast went out of the competition despite winning 3–0 against North Korea in their final match.

In the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, the Ivory Coast were drawn in a group with Sudan, Angola and Burkina Faso. Drogba scored the first goal for his team in the tournament against Sudan and his only goal in the group stage. In the quarter-finals, Drogba scored twice in the 3–0 win over Equatorial Guinea but he missed a penalty kick where he could have scored hat-trick in the match and tournament. He did not score in the semi-final in which the Ivory Coast beat Mali 1–0. In the final against Zambia, Drogba missed a penalty kick in the last 15 minutes of the game, which ended with their loss for the second time by penalty shootout.

In June 2014, Drogba was named in the Ivory Coast&#x27;s squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He won his 100th international cap in a pre-tournament friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina, scoring a penalty kick in his side&#x27;s 2–1 loss on 2 June. In the Ivory Coast&#x27;s opening match, he appeared as a second-half substitute with the team trailing 1–0 to Japan. Within five minutes of Drogba&#x27;s arrival, &quot;Les Éléphants&quot; scored twice to win the match 2–1. On 8 August 2014, Drogba announced his retirement from international football with a record of 65 goals in 105 appearances.

== Style of play ==

Drogba made his debut into football at the age of 21, much later than most footballers. He was known for his physical strength, aerial abilities, pace, and most notably, his powerful and accurate strikes. He played as a right-back in his youth due to his ability to hold the ball with his back to goal. He often played as a centre-forward throughout his professional career and is referred to as a &quot;target man&quot; by Martin Li of &quot;Bleacher Report&quot;. Richard Beech of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; says that his &quot;powerful and intrusive approach made him the lone striker José Mourinho grew to admire, and made it nearly impossible for opposing teams to isolate him and freeze him out of the game.&quot; Carl Anka of the BBC writes, &quot;Drogba&#x27;s robust playing style was so effective that he spearheaded the movement of the Premier League from the 4–4–2 era to a time where the 4–3–2–1 formation was king.&quot;

Drogba is known for performing in big games, with a record of 10 goals in 10 finals and winning 10 trophies. Carl Anka writes, &quot;Local derbies, top four six-pointers, title challenges or cup finals — if the game was big, Drogba got bigger&quot;. Drogba was also capable of assisting his teammates. Between the 2009–10 and 2011–12 seasons, he provided 24 assists in the Premier League, with a successful pass rate of 61.4%. He provided a total of 71 assists during his Chelsea tenure.

Drogba was known for taking free kicks. Dr. Ken Bray of the University of Bath has referred to him as a free kick specialist and said that, &quot;he really just passes the ball very hard&quot;. He adds, &quot;He hits it [the ball] very straight and appears to hit the ball with a very powerful side-foot action, almost like the technique used in a side-foot pass. Drogba&#x27;s style is about beating the goalkeeper with speed and depth.&quot; &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; states that he used the &quot;knuckleball&quot; technique developed by Juninho Pernambucano. Drogba&#x27;s trademark goal celebration saw him slide on his knees accompanied with an arm pump and a salute to fans – his celebration appears in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game.

Drogba is widely regarded as one of the three greatest African strikers alongside George Weah and Samuel Eto&#x27;o. Drogba&#x27;s robust playing style has made him the toughest striker to face for many defenders, including Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol, Chris Smalling, Nemanja Vidić, and Laurent Koscielny.

=== Personal and family life ===
Drogba was married to Lalla Diakité, a Malian woman whom he met in Paris, and the couple had three children together. His eldest son, Isaac, was born in France in 1999, grew up in England, and played in the Chelsea academy system. He signed for French club Guingamp in February 2018. Drogba has two younger brothers who are also footballers: Joël and Freddy Drogba. Freddy, born in 1992, played in French Ligue 1 side Dijon FCO. He is a devout Roman Catholic. His uncle Michel Goba was a professional footballer and Ivorian international. His cousin Kévin Goba (Michel&#x27;s son) was also a professional footballer who played in the lower leagues of France. In a statement posted on Instagram in January 2021, Drogba confirmed his divorce with his wife Lalla, stating that they had a mutual agreement. “I&#x27;m not in the habit of discussing my private life. But because of speculation in the media today, I can confirm that sadly, after 20 years together, Lalla and I took the difficult decision to separate last year... We remain very close and our main priorities have been to protect our children and our family&#x27;s private life. May God bless you.”

=== Philanthropy ===
Drogba is credited with helping bring peace to his country. After the Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 World Cup by defeating Sudan on 8 October 2005, Drogba made a desperate plea to the combatants, asking them to lay down their arms, a plea which was answered with a ceasefire after five years of civil war. Carl Anka writes, &quot;torn by religious and political tensions, Drogba seized a unifying moment for his country and invited TV cameras into the Elephants changing room where he made a speech to the camera. The man spoke and a nation listened — the elections went off without bloodshed.&quot; Drogba helped move an African Cup of Nations qualifier match to the stadium of Bouake, a move that helped confirm the peace process. On 24 January 2007, Drogba was appointed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a Goodwill Ambassador. The UNDP were impressed with his charity work and believed that he would help raise awareness on African issues. His involvement in the peace process led to &quot;Time&quot; magazine naming Drogba one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people for 2010.
Drogba&#x27;s charity work continued when, in late 2009, he announced he would be donating the £3 million signing on fee for his endorsement of Pepsi for the construction of a hospital in his hometown of Abidjan. This work was done through Drogba&#x27;s recently created &quot;Didier Drogba Foundation&quot; and Chelsea announced they too would donate the fee for the deal toward the Foundation&#x27;s project. Drogba decided on building the hospital after a recent trip to the Ivorian capital&#x27;s other hospitals, saying &quot;I decided the Foundation&#x27;s first project should be to build and fund a hospital giving people basic healthcare and a chance just to stay alive.&quot; The same year, Drogba teamed up with sportswear company Nike (whom he is sponsored by) and U2 frontman Bono on the eve of World AIDS Day to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Drogba said, &quot;It&#x27;s a big honour and pleasure for me to be linked with Bono and try to help him save some lives. AIDS and HIV is something that really destroyed Africa, and people don&#x27;t really realise how easy it is to save lives — only two pills a day, which is 40 cents.&quot;

In November 2014, Drogba appeared in FIFA&#x27;s &quot;11 against Ebola&quot; campaign with a selection of top football players from around the world, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Gareth Bale and Xavi. Under the slogan &quot;Together, we can beat Ebola&quot;, FIFA&#x27;s campaign was done in conjunction with the Confederation of African Football and health experts, with the players holding up eleven messages to raise awareness of the disease and ways to combat it. On 22 February 2018, Drogba, former AC Milan striker and current Liberia President George Weah, and teenage French prodigy Kylian Mbappé had a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the Élysée Palace in Paris that focused on a sports development project in Africa.
As a UNDP Goodwill Ambassador, Drogba has taken part in the annual Match Against Poverty alongside Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane. He has appeared in the 2012 and 2015 games. Levallois Sporting Club, the amateur club where Drogba began his career, used their percentage of his transfer fees  including £600,000 out of the £24 million paid when he joined Chelsea – first to ensure the club&#x27;s survival, and then to improve their stadium to incorporate modern sports facilities for the benefit of the local community. They renamed the new stadium Stade Didier Drogba after him.

In 2018, Drogba was appointed Vice President of Peace and Sport, an independent organisation based in Monaco and under the patronage of Prince Albert II of Monaco that works in areas around the world where people are estranged from one another. In June 2021, he received an honorary degree from RUSTA, due to his contributions to football and to the restoration of peace to his country.

=== Media ===
On 2 December 2019, Drogba co-hosted the 2019 Ballon d’Or ceremony in Paris alongside journalist Sandy Heribert. On 29 November 2021, the duo co-hosted the next ceremony in 2021 which saw Lionel Messi receive the men&#x27;s award for a record seventh time whilst Alexia Putellas won the Ballon d&#x27;Or Féminin. Drogba and Heribert would also host the 2023 and 2024 editions of the award.

<doc id="1031795" wikidata="Q7734233" url="?curid=1031795" title="The Fish-Slapping Dance">
<text>The Fish-Slapping Dance is a comedy sketch written and performed by the &quot;Monty Python&quot; team. The sketch was originally recorded in 1971 for a pan-European May Day special titled &quot;Euroshow 71&quot;. In 1972 it was broadcast as part of episode two of series three of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, which was titled &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs Brian Norris&#x27; Ford Popular&quot;.

==Overview==
The sketch stars John Cleese and Michael Palin in safari outfits and pith helmets at the side of a lock (Teddington Lock in west London to be more specific). Both are facing each other and light orchestral music plays while Palin dances towards Cleese, lightly slapping him in the face with two small pilchards, and returning to his starting spot. After Palin does this four times, he returns to his starting spot and stands still. In traditional British folk dancing, of which this is reminiscent, one would now expect the other dancer to repeat these steps. Instead, the music stops, Cleese reveals his fish – a much larger trout – and clobbers Palin on the head with it, knocking him into the water several feet below. Palin has discussed in various interviews how on rehearsal, the lock&#x27;s chamber was filled (raising the water level); however, when the filming took place, the chamber was empty, and he had to dive a frightening height on his jump.

In the 1972 Python episode the scene then changes to a Terry Gilliam animation in which a cartoon-version of Palin&#x27;s character sinks into the Canal until eaten by a giant German fish with a swastika on its body, then that fish is eaten by a bigger British one with a Royal Air Force roundel, and then that fish is eaten by an even bigger Chinese fish with a red star on its head.

The music is &quot;Merrymakers Dance&quot; from &quot;Nell Gwyn suite&quot; by British composer Sir Edward German (1862–1936).

The sketch is about 20 seconds long, but its situational non-verbal portrayal endears it to the audience. It remains one of Michael Palin&#x27;s favourite routines on the show, and he made it the centrepiece of his own choice of sketches for his &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Personal Best&quot; miniseries episode. Palin has stated that the sketch summarizes concisely what Python is all about.

==In popular culture==
*In the Monty Python-derived Broadway show &quot;Spamalot&quot;, written by Eric Idle, there is a song called &quot;The Fisch Schlapping Song&quot;, sung by pseudo-Finnish people, before the historian abruptly ends the song. During the song, men and women dressed in stereotypical Scandinavian garb slap each other with fish, very similar to the original sketch.
*The Swedish comedy team Angne &amp; Svullo did their own version of the fish slapping dance in one episode of their popular TV show in the late 1980s. The sketch starts the same as the original: first Angne slaps Svullo a few times in the face with small fish, then Svullo takes out a big fish and with a single blow knocks Angne into the water, laughing hysterically. However, in their version an old lady with an umbrella then comes by and starts hitting Svullo with her umbrella until he too falls into the water.
*In an interview, George Harrison&#x27;s son, Dhani Harrison, said that the Fish-Slapping Dance was one of his father&#x27;s favourite Monty Python sketches.
*The Australian satirical TV show &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot; did a &quot;British comedy sketch&quot; that mainly parodied Monty Python. At one point, someone is slapped with a fish.
*In &quot;&quot;, one of the &quot;sins&quot; of the Ninevites is that they slap people with fish, even slapping each other with fish (at which mention two Ninevites proceed to slap each other with increasingly huge fish, cumulating with the second Ninevite crushing the first Ninevite with an impossibly large fish). The commentary track to the DVD confirms the inspiration for this to be the Monty Python sketch.
*The Scout from &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; has a weapon called the Holy Mackerel based on the sketch. It is a reskin of his stock bat, but the kill feed counts how many times the player slaps someone with the fish, and when killed, it shouts, &quot;FISH KILL!&quot; The description reads, &quot;Getting hit by a fish has got to be humiliating. 
*On 14 March 2012, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s comedy show &quot;Adam Hills in Gordon Street Tonight&quot; did a sketch where a 15-year-old audience member performed the Fish-Slapping Dance with John Cleese.
*On 27 December 2020, the online version of The Guardian brought a caricature of Boris Johnson&#x27;s EU Trade Deal in the form of a fish slapping dance with credit to Monty Python.
* During Club Penguin&#x27;s development, an animation about a ninja penguin was made, which was inspired by the Fish-Slapping Dance.

<text>Bernardino (or Belardino) Mezzastris (or Mezastris) (ca. before 1539) was an Italian painter of the Umbrian School, from Foligno in Umbria, Italy. He was a minor artist: some of his frescoes on religious subjects survive, but garnered little critical acclaim. He should not be confused with the much more important Pier Antonio Mezzastris, another fresco artist at the time and possible relative.

==Relatives==
Bernardino Mezzastris is thought to be the son of Pier Antonio Mezzastris (ca. 1430-1506) who was an influential painter. Furthermore, likely relatives include Onofria Mezzastris, his aunt, Bartolomeo di Tommaso, his presumed uncle-in-law, and Paolo Nocchi, his possible great-uncle.

==Works==
Like the works of his presumed father, Pier Antonio Mezzastris, most of Bernardino’s fresco paintings involved various Christian figures and saints. Many of Bernardino&#x27;s frescoes and paintings are damaged, and only two are known to be signed by him. Detached frescoes are now located in the Pinacoteca Civica museum of Foligno.

=== Signed Works===

*&quot;Madonna and Child with angels in a rose garden, in the church of S. Illuminata of Montefalco&quot;, signed and dated 1507
*&quot;Fresco in the Chiesa Tonda of Spello&quot;, signed and dated 1533
*Painted niche in S. Illuminata, signed and dated 1529. &quot;This painted niche was commissioned by The Commune, after the cessation of a disease outbreak. This fresco depicts God above two angels, lifting a cloth of honour. Inside of the niche, there was intended to be a statue of the archangel Raphael; it currently houses a 15th-century wooden statue of St Nicolas of Tolentino.&quot;
=== Attributed Works===
* &quot;St Amicus&quot;, dated 1508
* &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, dated 1525. &quot;This fresco depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ accompanied by the Virgin Mary and St John the Baptist.&quot;
* &quot;St Roch&quot;, estimated 16th century

<doc id="1031810" wikidata="Q786900" url="?curid=1031810" title="MSISDN">
<text>MSISDN ( ) is a number uniquely identifying a subscription in a Global System for Mobile communications or a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System mobile network. It is the mapping of the telephone number to the subscriber identity module in a mobile or cellular phone. This abbreviation has several interpretations, the most common one being &quot;Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number&quot;.

The MSISDN and international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) are two important numbers used for identifying a mobile subscriber. The IMSI is stored in the SIM (the card inserted into the mobile phone), and uniquely identifies the mobile station, its home wireless network, and the home country of the home wireless network. The MSISDN is used for routing calls to the subscriber. The IMSI is often used as a key in the home location register (&quot;subscriber database&quot;) and the MSISDN is the number normally dialed to connect a call to the mobile phone. A SIM has a unique IMSI that does not change, while the MSISDN can change in time, i.e. different MSISDNs can be associated with the SIM.

The MSISDN follows the numbering plan defined in the International Telecommunication Standard Sector recommendation E.164.

==Abbreviation==
Depending on source or standardization body, the abbreviation MSISDN can be written out in several different ways. These are today the most widespread and common in use.

==MSISDN format==
The ITU-T recommendation E.164 limits the maximum length of an MSISDN to 15 digits. 1-3 digits are reserved for country code. Prefixes are not included (e.g., 00 prefixes an international MSISDN when dialing from Sweden). Minimum length of the MSISDN is not specified by ITU-T but is instead specified in the national numbering plans by the telecommunications regulator in each country.

In GSM and its variant DCS 1800, MSISDN is built up as

:MSISDN = CC + NDC + SN
:CC = Country Code
:NDC = National Destination Code, identifies one or part of a PLMN
:SN = Subscriber Number

In the GSM variant &quot;PCS 1900&quot;, MSISDN is built up as

:MSISDN = CC + NPA + SN
:CC = Country Code
:NPA = Number Planning Area

<text>The Clarinet Sonatas, Op. 120, Nos. 1 and 2, are a pair of works written for clarinet and piano by the Romantic composer Johannes Brahms. They were written in 1894 and are dedicated to the clarinetist Richard Mühlfeld. The sonatas stem from a period late in Brahms&#x27;s life where he discovered the beauty of the sound and tonal colour of the clarinet. The form of the clarinet sonata was largely undeveloped until after the completion of these sonatas, after which the combination of clarinet and piano was more readily used in composers’ new works. These were the last chamber pieces Brahms wrote before his death and are considered two of the great masterpieces in the clarinet repertoire. Brahms also produced a frequently performed transcription of these works for viola with alterations to better suit the instrument.

==Background==
By 1890, Brahms vowed to retire from composing, but his promise was short lived. In January 1891 he made a trip to Meiningen for an arts festival and was captivated by performances of Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto No. 1 and the Mozart &quot;Clarinet Quintet&quot;. The solo clarinetist was Richard Mühlfeld, and Brahms began a fond friendship with the man whom he so admired. The beautiful tone of “Fräulein Klarinette” (as Brahms would nickname Mühlfeld) inspired him to begin composing again less than a year after he retired. 
The fruits of their friendship were four remarkable additions to the still modest clarinet repertoire of that time, including the trio in A minor for clarinet, cello and piano Op 114 (1891), the B minor quintet for clarinet and strings, Op. 115 (1891), and two clarinet sonatas. In July 1894, at his Bad Ischl retreat, Brahms completed the sonatas. He wrote to Mühlfeld on August 26, inviting him to Bad Ischl, to perform them, stating cryptically that &quot;it would be splendid if you brought your B clarinet.&quot; As Mühlfeld had other commitments that summer, he delayed responding, but went to Vienna in September to meet Brahms and to acquaint himself with the two sonatas. They were first performed (by Brahms and Mühlfeld) privately for Duke Georg and his family in September of that year. Brahms and Mühlfeld then performed them for Clara Schumann in November 1894, before their public premieres on January 7, 1895. Brahms’ experience in writing his Clarinet Quintet three years earlier led him to compose the sonatas for clarinet and piano because he preferred the sound over that of clarinet with strings. The keys of the sonatas—F minor and E major—correspond to the keys of the two clarinet concertos which Weber composed more than eighty years earlier.

==Sonata No. 1 in F minor==
===Structure===
Sonata No. 1 consists of the following movements:

====I. &quot;Allegro appassionato&quot;====
:F minor, in time

The first movement is in sonata form. It begins with a solo piano introduction in three parallel octaves, outlining a recurring motif throughout the movement. The clarinet then enters with the slurred first theme. The piano takes over the theme, with the clarinet playing more of an embellishing role. It was normal in clarinet music before the sonatas for the soloist to play mostly, if not always, the melody. Brahms did not reduce the scope of the piano part to accommodate for the clarinet, but created a more equal and harmonious relationship between soloist and pianist. The quiet transition between the two themes is in D major and features staggered entrances between the hands of the piano. The second theme introduces dotted rhythms and is marked &quot;marcato&quot;, contrasting with the first theme. It passes through many key areas quickly before finally resting on C minor.

The development begins by expanding on ideas heard in the introduction and transition. The piano plays with staggered hand entrances and joins the clarinet in recalling the second bar of the introduction. The music makes a false movement towards A major, instead landing on E major. The introduction material takes over and winds down to . A &quot;subito forte&quot; evokes the second theme combined with staggered entrances from both piano hands and clarinet. The second theme is finally presented and leads to the recapitulation.

The introduction is restated &quot;forte&quot; in the key of C minor. Brahms brings the key back around to F minor and the first theme, transition, and second theme are heard again. Tonally, this section does not stray far from F although the music goes through major and minor sections. A final statement of the first theme leads into the coda, marked &quot;Sostenuto ed espressivo&quot;. The coda is slower in tempo and based on material from the introduction. The movement ends quietly in F major.

====II. &quot;Andante un poco adagio&quot;====
:A major, in time

The second movement is in ternary form. The clarinet introduces a simple descending theme decorated with turns. The piano writing is sparse in the first theme area. This A section is repeated twice, once ending on a half cadence and the other with a perfect authentic cadence on the home key of A major.

The B section is characterized by faster rhythmic and harmonic motion. The piano plays sixteenth notes outlining the harmonies while the clarinet continues playing a slurred melody. The harmony descends in an imitation of the A section melody through the keys D major, C major, and A major. The clarinet gets a chance to play the sixteenth notes that the piano had before the modulation to E major.

The A melody returns in the piano in the “wrong” key of E major, moves to C major, and finally back to the A major. The A section is then restated in its entirety with a more active piano accompaniment. A short interlude of sixteenth notes in the piano alludes to the B section and a final iteration of the melody ends the movement.

====III. &quot;Allegretto grazioso&quot;====
:A major, in time

The third movement is also in ternary form. The A section consists of an eight bar melody in the &quot;wrong key&quot; of E-flat major played by the clarinet, and then traded off to the piano with the clarinet lending supporting lines. A &quot;forte&quot; repeated section in the home key inverts the melody and the second ending leads to the B section.

The piano takes up a descending line syncopated between the two hands while the clarinet adds a low supporting line confined within the space of a minor third. Another repeated section lets the clarinet play the descending melody. After the repeat, the melody from the A section returns and ends the movement.

====IV. &quot;Vivace&quot;====
:F major, alla breve ()

The fourth movement is in an altered rondo form that can be described as . The movement begins with three accented Fs in a piano introduction serving as a sort of call to identify the first theme. The A theme is marked &quot;leggero&quot; in the clarinet and is mostly eighth notes in stepwise motion. The contrasting B theme is made up of quarter note triplets and is more slurred and leisurely. After a bombastic return to A′, the quiet C theme is played in the piano and then handed off to the clarinet. The clarinet then plays the “call” from the introduction while the piano states the B theme again. Finally, the final A″ section ends with a coda and the sonata is finished in F major.

===Arrangements and transcriptions===
* Luciano Berio is known to have orchestrated and reworked the whole sonata for orchestra in 1986. The resulting composition was entitled as &quot;Op. 120, No. 1&quot;, as a clear reference to the original work&#x27;s catalogue number.

==Sonata No. 2 in E major==

Sonata No. 2 is in three movements.

<text>Chemokines (), or chemotactic cytokines, are a family of small cytokines or signaling proteins secreted by cells that induce directional movement of leukocytes, as well as other cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells. In addition to playing a major role in the activation of host immune responses, chemokines are important for biological processes, including morphogenesis and wound healing, as well as in the pathogenesis of diseases like cancers.

Cytokine proteins are classified as chemokines according to behavior and structural characteristics. In addition to being known for mediating chemotaxis, chemokines are all approximately 8–10 kilodaltons in mass and have four cysteine residues in conserved locations that are key to forming their 3-dimensional shape.

These proteins have historically been known under several other names including the &quot;SIS family of cytokines&quot;, &quot;SIG family of cytokines&quot;, &quot;SCY family of cytokines&quot;, &quot;Platelet factor-4 superfamily&quot; or &quot;intercrines&quot;. Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory and can be induced during an immune response to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling the migration of cells during normal processes of tissue maintenance or development. Chemokines are found in all vertebrates, some viruses and some bacteria, but none have been found in other invertebrates.

Chemokines have been classified into four main subfamilies: CXC, CC, CX3C and C. All of these proteins exert their biological effects by interacting with G protein-linked transmembrane receptors called chemokine receptors, that are selectively found on the surfaces of their target cells.

== Function ==

The major role of chemokines is to act as a chemoattractant to guide the migration of cells. Cells that are attracted by chemokines follow a signal of increasing chemokine concentration towards the source of the chemokine. Some chemokines control cells of the immune system during processes of immune surveillance, such as directing lymphocytes to the lymph nodes so they can screen for invasion of pathogens by interacting with antigen-presenting cells residing in these tissues. These are known as homeostatic chemokines and are produced and secreted without any need to stimulate their source cells. Some chemokines have roles in development; they promote angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels), or guide cells to tissues that provide specific signals critical for cellular maturation. Other chemokines are inflammatory and are released from a wide variety of cells in response to bacterial infection, viruses and agents that cause physical damage such as silica or the urate crystals that occur in gout. Their release is often stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1. Inflammatory chemokines function mainly as chemoattractants for leukocytes, recruiting monocytes, neutrophils and other effector cells from the blood to sites of infection or tissue damage. Certain inflammatory chemokines activate cells to initiate an immune response or promote wound healing. They are released by many different cell types and serve to guide cells of both innate immune system and adaptive immune system.

==Types by function==
Chemokines are functionally divided into two groups:
*Homeostatic: are constitutively produced in certain tissues and are responsible for basal leukocyte migration. These include: CCL14, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, CCL25, CCL27, CXCL12 and CXCL13. This classification is not strict; for example, CCL20 can act also as pro-inflammatory chemokine.
*Inflammatory: these are formed under pathological conditions (on pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, LPS, or viruses) and actively participate in the inflammatory response attracting immune cells to the site of inflammation. Examples are: CXCL-8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10.

== Homing==
The main function of chemokines is to manage the migration of leukocytes (homing) in the respective anatomical locations in inflammatory and homeostatic processes.

Basal: homeostatic chemokines are basal produced in the thymus and lymphoid tissues. Their homeostatic function in homing is best exemplified by the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 (expressed within lymph nodes and on lymphatic endothelial cells) and their receptor CCR7 (expressed on cells destined for homing in cells to these organs). Using these ligands is possible routing antigen-presenting cells (APC) to lymph nodes during the adaptive immune response. Among other homeostatic chemokine receptors include: CCR9, CCR10, and CXCR5, which are important as part of the cell addresses for tissue-specific homing of leukocytes. CCR9 supports the migration of leukocytes into the intestine, CCR10 to the skin and CXCR5 supports the migration of B-cell to follicles of lymph nodes. As well CXCL12 (SDF-1) constitutively produced in the bone marrow promotes proliferation of progenitor B cells in the bone marrow microenvironment.

Inflammatory: inflammatory chemokines are produced in high concentrations during infection or injury and determine the migration of inflammatory leukocytes into the damaged area. Typical inflammatory chemokines include: CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL8. A typical example is CXCL-8, which acts as a chemoattractant for neutrophils. In contrast to the homeostatic chemokine receptors, there is significant promiscuity (redundancy) associated with binding receptor and inflammatory chemokines. This often complicates research on receptor-specific therapeutics in this area.

==Types by cell attracted==

*Monocytes / macrophages: the key chemokines that attract these cells to the site of inflammation include: CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL13, CCL17 and CCL22.
*T-lymphocytes: the four key chemokines that are involved in the recruitment of T lymphocytes to the site of inflammation are: CCL2, CCL1, CCL22 and CCL17. Furthermore, CXCR3 expression by T-cells is induced following T-cell activation and activated T-cells are attracted to sites of inflammation where the IFN-y inducible chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are secreted.
*Mast cells: on their surface express several receptors for chemokines: CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR2, and CXCR4. Ligands of these receptors CCL2 and CCL5 play an important role in mast cell recruitment and activation in the lung. There is also evidence that CXCL8 might be inhibitory of mast cells.
*Eosinophils: the migration of eosinophils into various tissues involved several chemokines of CC family: CCL11, CCL24, CCL26, CCL5, CCL7, CCL13, and CCL3. Chemokines CCL11 (eotaxin) and CCL5 (RANTES) acts through a specific receptor CCR3 on the surface of eosinophils, and eotaxin plays an essential role in the initial recruitment of eosinophils into the lesion.
*Neutrophils: are regulated primarily by CXC chemokines. An example CXCL8 (IL-8) is chemoattractant for neutrophils and also activating their metabolic and degranulation.

==Structural characteristics==

Proteins are classified into the chemokine family based on their structural characteristics, not just their ability to attract cells. All chemokines are small, with a molecular mass of between 8 and 10 kDa. They are approximately 20-50% identical to each other; that is, they share gene sequence and amino acid sequence homology. They all also possess conserved amino acids that are important for creating their 3-dimensional or tertiary structure, such as (in most cases) four cysteines that interact with each other in pairs to create a Greek key shape that is a characteristic of chemokines. Intramolecular disulfide bonds typically join the first to third, and the second to fourth cysteine residues, numbered as they appear in the protein sequence of the chemokine. Typical chemokine proteins are produced as pro-peptides, beginning with a signal peptide of approximately 20 amino acids that gets cleaved from the active (mature) portion of the molecule during the process of its secretion from the cell. The first two cysteines, in a chemokine, are situated close together near the N-terminal end of the mature protein, with the third cysteine residing in the centre of the molecule and the fourth close to the C-terminal end. A loop of approximately ten amino acids follows the first two cysteines and is known as the &quot;N-loop&quot;. This is followed by a single-turn helix, called a 310-helix, three β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix. These helices and strands are connected by turns called &quot;30s&quot;, &quot;40s&quot; and &quot;50s&quot; loops; the third and fourth cysteines are located in the 30s and 50s loops.
==Types by structure==
Members of the chemokine family are divided into four groups depending on the spacing of their first two cysteine residues. Thus the nomenclature for chemokines is, e.g.: CCL1 for the ligand 1 of the CC-family of chemokines, and CCR1 for its respective receptor.

===CC chemokines===
The CC chemokine (or β-chemokine) proteins have two adjacent cysteines (amino acids), near their amino terminus. 
There have been at least 27 distinct members of this subgroup reported for mammals, called CC chemokine ligands (CCL)-1 to -28; CCL10 is the same as CCL9. Chemokines of this subfamily usually contain four cysteines (C4-CC chemokines), but a small number of CC chemokines possess six cysteines (C6-CC chemokines). C6-CC chemokines include CCL1, CCL15, CCL21, CCL23 and CCL28. CC chemokines induce the migration of monocytes and other cell types such as NK cells and dendritic cells.

Examples of CC chemokine include monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2) which induces monocytes to leave the bloodstream and enter the surrounding tissue to become tissue macrophages.

CCL5 (or RANTES) attracts cells such as T cells, eosinophils and basophils that express the receptor CCR5.

Increased CCL11 levels in blood plasma are associated with aging (and reduced neurogenesis) in mice and humans.

===CXC chemokines===
The two N-terminal cysteines of CXC chemokines (or α-chemokines) are separated by one amino acid, represented in this name with an &quot;X&quot;. There have been 17 different CXC chemokines described in mammals, that are subdivided into two categories, those with a specific amino acid sequence (or motif) of glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (or ELR for short) immediately before the first cysteine of the CXC motif (ELR-positive), and those without an ELR motif (ELR-negative). ELR-positive CXC chemokines specifically induce the migration of neutrophils, and interact with chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. An example of an ELR-positive CXC chemokine is interleukin-8 (IL-8), which induces neutrophils to leave the bloodstream and enter into the surrounding tissue. Other CXC chemokines that lack the ELR motif, such as CXCL13, tend to be chemoattractant for lymphocytes. CXC chemokines bind to CXC chemokine receptors, of which seven have been discovered to date, designated CXCR1-7.

===C chemokines===
The third group of chemokines is known as the C chemokines (or γ chemokines), and is unlike all other chemokines in that it has only two cysteines; one N-terminal cysteine and one cysteine downstream. Two chemokines have been described for this subgroup and are called XCL1 (lymphotactin-α) and XCL2 (lymphotactin-β).

===CX3C chemokines===
A fourth group has also been discovered and members have three amino acids between the two cysteines and is termed CX3C chemokine (or d-chemokines). The only CX3C chemokine discovered to date is called fractalkine (or CX3CL1). It is both secreted and tethered to the surface of the cell that expresses it, thereby serving as both a chemoattractant and as an adhesion molecule.

==Receptors==
Chemokine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors containing 7 transmembrane domains that are found on the surface of leukocytes. Approximately 19 different chemokine receptors have been characterized to date, which are divided into four families depending on the type of chemokine they bind; CXCR that bind CXC chemokines, CCR that bind CC chemokines, CX3CR1 that binds the sole CX3C chemokine (CX3CL1), and XCR1 that binds the two XC chemokines (XCL1 and XCL2). They share many structural features; they are similar in size (with about 350 amino acids), have a short, acidic N-terminal end, seven helical transmembrane domains with three intracellular and three extracellular hydrophilic loops, and an intracellular C-terminus containing serine and threonine residues important for receptor regulation. The first two extracellular loops of chemokine receptors each has a conserved cysteine residue that allow formation of a disulfide bridge between these loops. G proteins are coupled to the C-terminal end of the chemokine receptor to allow intracellular signaling after receptor activation, while the N-terminal domain of the chemokine receptor determines ligand binding specificity.

===Signal transduction===
Chemokine receptors associate with G-proteins to transmit cell signals following ligand binding. Activation of G proteins, by chemokine receptors, causes the subsequent activation of an enzyme known as phospholipase C (PLC). PLC cleaves a molecule called phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messenger molecules known as Inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) that trigger intracellular signaling events; DAG activates another enzyme called protein kinase C (PKC), and IP3 triggers the release of calcium from intracellular stores. These events promote many signaling cascades (such as the MAP kinase pathway) that generate responses like chemotaxis, degranulation, release of superoxide anions and changes in the avidity of cell adhesion molecules called integrins within the cell harbouring the chemokine receptor.

==Infection control==
The discovery that the β chemokines RANTES, MIP (macrophage inflammatory proteins) 1α and 1β (now known as CCL5, CCL3 and CCL4 respectively) suppress HIV-1 provided the initial connection and indicated that these molecules might control infection as part of immune responses in vivo, and that sustained delivery of such inhibitors have the capacity of long-term infection control. The association of chemokine production with antigen-induced proliferative responses, more favorable clinical status in HIV infection, as well as with an uninfected status in subjects at risk for infection suggests a positive role for these molecules in controlling the natural course of HIV infection.

<text>Petr Čech (; born 20 May 1982) is a Czech former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper and current ice hockey player who plays as a goaltender for Oxford City Stars. He has been described as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, and, by some, as the greatest goalkeeper, alongside Peter Schmeichel, in Premier League history.

Čech began his senior career at Chmel Blšany in 1999, where he played sporadically for two seasons prior to relocating to Sparta Prague in 2001. At age 19, Čech became a first team regular, and his single campaign with the club saw him register a league record of not conceding a goal in 903 competitive minutes. This led to his first move abroad, when he relocated to France to join Ligue 1 side Rennes for a fee of €5.5 million (£3.9 million) in 2002.

In France, Čech starred in an under-performing team, and was the subject of a then club-record transfer for a goalkeeper when he moved to Premier League side Chelsea for a fee of £7 million (€9.8 million) in 2004. In his eleven-year spell at Chelsea, Čech made 494 appearances in all competitions, making him the club&#x27;s seventh most capped player of all time. He also helped the club win four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one UEFA Champions League title, and one UEFA Europa League title. Čech also holds Chelsea&#x27;s all-time record for clean sheets, with 228. Čech departed Chelsea in 2015 to join city rivals Arsenal for a fee of £10 million, where he won another FA Cup before retiring in 2019.

A Czech international, Čech made his debut with the Czech Republic in 2002, and is the most capped player in the history of the Czech national team, with 124 caps. He represented his country at the 2006 World Cup, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 European Championships. He was voted into the Euro 2004 All-Star team after helping the Czechs reach the semi-finals, and served as the team&#x27;s captain, prior to retiring from international competition in 2016. Čech also holds the record for the most Czech Footballer of the Year and Czech Golden Ball wins. 
Čech holds a number of goalkeeping records, including the Premier League record for fewest appearances required to reach 100 clean sheets, having done so in 180 appearances, the most clean sheets in a season (24), as well as the record for the most clean sheets in Premier League history (202). Čech is also the only goalkeeper to have won the Premier League Golden Glove with two separate clubs, and has won it a joint record four times; in the 2004–05, 2009–10, 2013–14 and the 2015–16 seasons. He was voted the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper in 2005, received the award of Best Goalkeeper in the 2004–05, 2006–07 and 2007–08 editions of the UEFA Champions League, and went 1,025 minutes without conceding a goal in the 2004–05 season, a league record. He has the third most clean sheets since 2000 among all goalkeepers.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Čech started playing football aged seven for Škoda Plzeň (later known as Viktoria Plzeň). In his early days, he played as a striker, although he moved to the goalkeeper position after breaking his leg at age ten. Čech joined Czech First League team Chmel Blšany in June 1999 and made his league debut at the age of 17 in October 1999, in a 3–1 loss against Sparta.

Čech signed a five-and-a-half-year contract with Sparta Prague at the age of 18 in January 2001, although he remained at Blšany until the end of the 2000–01 season. In November 2001, Čech broke the record formerly held by Theodor Reimann for the longest time elapsed without conceding a goal in the Czech professional league, stretching his run to 855 minutes. His clean sheet record finally ended when he was beaten by a goal from Marcel Melecký of Bohemians on 17 November 2001, ending his record at 903 consecutive minutes without conceding.

Despite Čech not winning the league title in the spring of 2002 with Sparta, he attracted interest from English clubs including Arsenal due to his international performances. Due to difficulties in obtaining a work permit, however, a proposed deal with the &quot;Gunners&quot; fell through.

===Rennes===
In July 2002, Čech moved to French club Rennes, signing a four-year contract for a transfer fee reported as CZK150 million (€5.5 million).

During his first season in France, he was awarded man of the match against Paris Saint-Germain by &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;. In May 2003, Rennes was at the bottom of the league table, yet escaped relegation with a win over Montpellier in the final matchday.

===Chelsea===
Chelsea made a transfer bid for Čech in January 2004 which was rejected. However in February Rennes agreed to Čech&#x27;s move to Chelsea for £7 million. Čech signed a five-year contract, to commence in July 2004, becoming the most expensive goalkeeper in Chelsea&#x27;s history at that time. Čech&#x27;s was one of many British club transfers that came under the spotlight in the 2006 football corruption investigation for being potentially in breach of transfer regulations. The Stevens inquiry report, published in June 2007, found no evidence of illegal payments.

====2004–06: Golden Glove, back-to-back Premier League wins====

When Čech arrived at Chelsea, Carlo Cudicini was already established as Chelsea&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper. Cudicini, however, suffered a pre-season elbow injury that allowed Chelsea manager José Mourinho to promote Čech into the starting spot, where he became the first-choice goalkeeper in his first season. He kept a clean sheet in his Premier League debut in a 1–0 victory over Manchester United.
On 5 March 2005, Čech set a new Premier League record of 1,025 minutes without letting in a goal, though his record was later broken by Manchester United&#x27;s Edwin van der Sar. Čech finally conceded to Leon McKenzie of Norwich City, after keeping a clean sheet in the league since 12 December 2004 when Thierry Henry scored for Arsenal. Čech was given a special award by the Premier League for the new record, and he was also awarded the Premier League Golden Glove at the end of the 2004–05 season for keeping a record 24 clean sheets in the Premier League.

Chelsea retained the Premier League title in the 2005–06 season, with Čech playing in 34 league matches. Chelsea conceded just 22 times during the season. In January 2006, he was named the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper for 2005. In February 2006, Čech signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the club until 2010. He was also named the Czech Footballer of the Year for the first time.

Čech underwent minor shoulder surgery on 27 June 2006 to repair a long-standing injury stemming from the previous season. He returned to action on 27 August 2006.

====Head injury====
Čech sustained a head injury in the match against Reading at the Madejski Stadium on 14 October 2006 when he collided with Reading midfielder Stephen Hunt inside Chelsea&#x27;s penalty area within the first minute of a Premier League match. Hunt&#x27;s right knee hit Čech&#x27;s head, leaving the goalkeeper requiring treatment. Čech was taken off after several minutes and replaced by Carlo Cudicini, who himself was knocked unconscious later in the same game, forcing Chelsea captain John Terry to play in goal for the match&#x27;s remaining minutes. Čech underwent surgery for a depressed skull fracture. Initially unaware of the seriousness of the injury, the doctors later reported that it nearly cost Čech his life, and as a result of the collision, he suffered intense headaches. Chelsea went on to win the match 1–0.

Chelsea manager José Mourinho blamed Hunt for Čech&#x27;s injury, saying that his challenge was &quot;a disgrace&quot;. He also criticised the South Central Ambulance Service and match referee Mike Riley. A number of commentators, including current and former goalkeepers, saw the incident as highlighting the need for greater protection for goalkeepers.

Čech was able to return home on 24 October 2006 and participated in light training the following week. Chelsea, however, announced that the goalkeeper would be out for three months, in line with medical advice on the time needed for complete recovery from the skull fracture. In an interview, Čech said that he had no memory of the injury itself.

====Return====
Čech made his comeback in a Premier League match in a 2–0 defeat against Liverpool on 20 January 2007, wearing a rugby style headguard made by Canterbury of New Zealand and carrying the manufacturer&#x27;s logo. This caused friction with Czech national team sponsor Puma and Chelsea&#x27;s apparel manufacturer Adidas. The matter was resolved after the latter sponsor developed its own headgear for Čech to wear in club matches, while the player went on to wear an unbranded cap for national team games. Čech wore the headguard for the rest of his career.

Although Chelsea lost Čech&#x27;s comeback match, he then went approximately 810 minutes of Premier League play without conceding a goal. On 11 April 2007, Čech was awarded the Premier League Player of the Month for the first time in his career, in recognition of his eight successive league clean sheets. He was the first goalkeeper to receive the award since Tim Flowers in 2000. This run was ended during a 4–1 Chelsea victory over West Ham United on 18 April 2007 when Carlos Tevez scored against him.

Čech also kept a clean sheet for Chelsea in the 2007 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. He and United&#x27;s Edwin van der Sar shared the honour of being the first goalkeepers to keep a clean sheet over 90 minutes in a competitive fixture at the new Wembley Stadium, but Čech became the first goalkeeper to end a competitive game unbeaten, as Chelsea beat United 1–0 to win the FA Cup.

====2007–09: UEFA Champions League finalist, FA Cup triumph====
Čech started the 2007–08 season conceding two goals against Birmingham City in the first match of the season. Despite this, Chelsea managed to win 3–2 and set an English record for their 64th consecutive unbeaten league match at home.

In November 2007, Čech suffered an injury to his right calf muscle in the 0–0 UEFA Champions League group stage match at Schalke 04. The following month, on 23 December 2007, he had to be replaced during a match against Blackburn Rovers due to a hip injury.

Chelsea suffered their first major blow when they lost the League Cup final to Tottenham Hotspur, with Čech parrying the ball onto Jonathan Woodgate&#x27;s head for the winner. He played in several games until injuring his ankle in training on the eve of Chelsea&#x27;s home Champions League tie with Greek champions Olympiacos. In the weeks that followed, Čech missed key games of Chelsea&#x27;s campaign, including the derby with Arsenal and both legs of the Champions League quarter-final.

On 7 April 2008, it was announced that Čech had undergone emergency surgery on his chin and lips following an accidental collision with Tal Ben Haim during training. He had 50 stitches put on his mouth and chin. He returned to action on 14 April, in a home match against Wigan Athletic which Chelsea drew 1–1. He appeared in the Champions League final against Manchester United, where Chelsea lost in a penalty shoot-out.

Čech signed a new five-year contract in July 2008 to keep him at Chelsea until 2013. Chelsea started the 2008–09 season in good form, conceding only 7 goals in 17 games and keeping 11 clean sheets, 10 of which with Čech in goal.

In November 2008, Chelsea beat Sunderland 5–0 at Stamford Bridge, a game which marked the 100th match Čech had played for Chelsea without conceding a goal. Chelsea had a 1–0 victory over Juventus in the Champions League on his 200th appearance for the club, and he also starred in a 1–0 away victory at Villa Park against Aston Villa, saving from Gabriel Agbonlahor and Gareth Barry. The following week, Čech helped Chelsea move up to second place in the league by saving from Paul Scharner in the first half against Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea won 2–1. Successive clean sheets by Čech in Chelsea&#x27;s wins against Portsmouth and Coventry City saw his side consolidate their position in the Premier League whilst progressing into the FA Cup semi-finals. Čech also made saves from Dirk Kuyt and Xabi Alonso as Chelsea beat Liverpool 3–1 at Anfield in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final.

In a crucial Premier League game in April 2009, with Chelsea comfortably leading 4–0 against Bolton Wanderers, Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink took off both Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard only for Bolton to score three late goals which questioned the Chelsea defence, and in particular Čech. Čech, however, responded when he saved a penalty from Mark Noble in Chelsea&#x27;s 1–0 win at the Boleyn Ground against West Ham. He also kept a clean sheet in the next game against Barcelona during the Champions League semi-final first leg match. Following a 3–2 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light, Čech and Chelsea finished the season with the joint-tightest defence in the Premier League along with Manchester United, having conceded just 24 goals over the course of the season. Despite conceding the fastest goal in FA Cup final history, Čech helped Chelsea&#x27;s 2009 FA Cup Final triumph over Everton. Chelsea won 2–1, earning the Czech his seventh trophy at the club.

Former Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari accused Čech, Michael Ballack and Drogba of causing his sacking, saying that they &quot;did not accept my training methods or my demands&quot;. Scolari also said that it stemmed from a row between him and the Czech goalkeeper over the latter&#x27;s alleged insistence on being given a personal coach. Čech denied the claims saying that he was &quot;disappointed with [Scolari] because never in my life have I had a personal goalkeeping coach&quot;.

====2009–10: Domestic double, second Golden Glove====
Čech began the 2009–10 season in winning form with Chelsea, beating Manchester United in the Community Shield final at Wembley. With the game level at 2–2 at the end of normal time, Čech saved penalties from Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra. Čech kept goal for Chelsea in the six-match winning run that opened their season and placed them on top of the Premier League. On 26 September 2009, however, Čech was sent off and at the same time conceded the winning penalty for a trip on Wigan forward Hugo Rodallega, in the defeat that broke the run and conceded the lead in the league to Manchester United. On 27 February 2010, Čech sustained a calf injury in the Champions League match against Inter Milan. On 13 April, Čech kept his 100th Premier League clean sheet for Chelsea, against Bolton. He won his second Premier League Golden Glove award for the season, having kept 17 clean sheets in the Premier League as Chelsea secured a third title. He concluded his season by saving a Kevin-Prince Boateng penalty against Portsmouth in the FA Cup final, ensuring that the &quot;Blues&quot; went on to retain the Cup and achieve their first domestic double.

====2010–13: Sustained domestic and European success====
During 2010–11 pre-season training, Čech reaggravated the calf injury he suffered against Inter the previous season. Scans revealed a muscle tear that sidelined him for the next three weeks, including Chelsea&#x27;s 3–1 loss to Manchester United in the Community Shield. He returned on 14 August and kept a clean sheet as Chelsea beat West Bromwich Albion 6–0. Čech then kept another clean sheet in a 2–0 win over Arsenal, before keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw at Villa Park. On 7 March, Čech made his 300th Chelsea appearance, against Premier League side Blackpool, which Chelsea went on to win 3–1. On 19 May, Čech was awarded the Chelsea Player of the Year for the first time. More than 28,000 fans voted for the award, which was handed over by Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti.

Čech started the opening game of Chelsea&#x27;s 2011–12 Premier League season away to Stoke City, which ended 0–0. On 18 August 2011, Čech was ruled out for up to four weeks after he sustained a knee injury in training. He made his return three weeks later against Sunderland in which Chelsea won 2–1. He kept a clean sheet in Chelsea&#x27;s first Champions League match of the season in a 2–0 win over Bayer Leverkusen. On 27 February, Čech was announced as the Czech Footballer of the Year for 2011, winning the award for the fifth time. On 24 March, Čech played his 250th league game for Chelsea against Tottenham Hotspur in a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge. Čech saved a penalty in extra time against former teammate Arjen Robben, and two penalties in the subsequent penalty shoot-out, of the 2012 Champions League final against Bayern Munich resulting in the first Champions League win for Chelsea. Čech was named the Fans&#x27; Man of the Match following his heroic performance in goal for &quot;The Blues&quot;. By winning the Champions League, Čech became just the fourth Czech to win the competition. He finished the season by signing a new four-year contract with Chelsea in May, keeping him with the club until the end of the 2015–16 season.

Čech started in Chelsea&#x27;s first match of the 2012–13 season, the 2012 Community Shield against Manchester City, but failed to keep a clean sheet as Chelsea went down 3–2 to goals from Yaya Touré, Carlos Tevez and Samir Nasri. He also featured in the last UEFA Super Cup to be played at Monaco&#x27;s Stade Louis II, in which he conceded four goals as Chelsea lost 4–1 to the UEFA Europa League winners Atlético Madrid. In October 2012, Čech took the captain&#x27;s armband as regular Chelsea captain John Terry was sidelined with a four-match ban.

In May 2013, Čech won the UEFA Europa League when Chelsea defeated Benfica 2–1 in the final.

====2013–15: Third Golden Glove and departure====
On 19 October 2013, Čech made his 300th Premier League appearance for Chelsea, in a 4–1 home win over newly promoted side Cardiff City. On 11 January 2014, he kept his 209th clean sheet for Chelsea in all competitions in a 2–0 away win at Hull City, beating the club record set by Peter Bonetti.

On 18 March 2014, Čech made his 100th UEFA Champions League appearance in a 2–0 win over Galatasaray at Stamford Bridge. He became the fourth goalkeeper to make a century of appearances in the competition after Iker Casillas, Víctor Valdés and Oliver Kahn.

On 22 April 2014, Čech was substituted in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid with a shoulder injury. Chelsea manager José Mourinho stated that the injury would prevent Čech from playing again in the 2013–14 season. Despite the injury, Čech would finish the season as the joint winner of the Premier League Golden Glove award along with Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny, both keeping 16 clean sheets.

Čech&#x27;s place as Chelsea&#x27;s starting goalkeeper was taken at the start of the season by Thibaut Courtois. This was possibly due to Čech&#x27;s long standing injury concerns to his shoulder, back and knees. On 24 September 2014, Čech made his first appearance of the season against Bolton in the third round of the League Cup, a 2–1 victory. He made his first league appearance of the season on 5 October, replacing the injured Courtois in the first half of a 2–0 home win over Arsenal. His second start of the season came in the Champions League group stage victory against Slovenian side Maribor, keeping a clean sheet as Chelsea won 6–0. With Courtois injured, Čech made his first league start of the season on 13 December against Hull, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win.

Despite him being second choice, Mourinho stated that Čech would not be sold in the January 2015 transfer window due to third-choice Mark Schwarzer leaving for Leicester City. During that month, Čech made back to back starts in the Premier League against Newcastle United at home, followed by Swansea City away from home, keeping clean sheets in both wins. On 1 March 2015, Čech started in goal in the 2015 Football League Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory to win the trophy for the third time in his career.

===Arsenal===
====2015–16: Fourth Golden Glove, league runner-up====


Čech signed for Chelsea&#x27;s Premier League rivals Arsenal on a four-year contract on 29 June 2015, for a fee of around £10 million. His move saw him subjected to death threats by a few Chelsea supporters. The departure of Wojciech Szczęsny to Roma on loan made Čech first-choice goalkeeper ahead of David Ospina. On 2 August, Čech won his first trophy with Arsenal after beating former side Chelsea 1–0 in the 2015 FA Community Shield. A week later, he made his Premier League debut for Arsenal in a 2–0 home defeat to West Ham. On 20 October, he made his first Champions League appearance for Arsenal in a 2–0 win against Bayern Munich.

Čech recorded his 170th Premier League clean sheet in a 2–0 win against AFC Bournemouth on 28 December 2015, setting a new league record and overtaking previous record holder David James. On 2 March 2016, he was sidelined due to a calf injury while playing against Swansea. On 2 April, he returned as an unused substitute against Watford and returned to the pitch on 17 April against Crystal Palace in a narrow 1–1 draw and guided Arsenal to its 500th Premier League win on 21 April against West Brom. Marking the end of his debut season with Arsenal, he was named the Premier League Goalkeeper of the season by critics and platforms for winning the Golden Glove with an under-performing defence.

====2016–17: FA Cup win====
Čech was given the captain&#x27;s armband for Arsenal in their 4–3 opening day home loss to Liverpool. In September 2016, he featured for the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 rout by Arsenal of his former side Chelsea at the Emirates. On 24 April 2017, Čech played in the 2016–17 FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City at Wembley, which Arsenal won 2–1. During this season, Cech received mild criticism among Arsenal fans for his inability to play with the ball at his feet but meanwhile he had the third most clearances among all goalkeepers in Premier League with 11 which manifested his transformation into a &quot;sweeper keeper&quot;. Čech again held the captain&#x27;s armband on 10 May 2017 in a 2–0 win over Southampton at the St Mary&#x27;s Stadium. Čech was sidelined for the FA Cup Final due to injury, but Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–1. Čech won his fifth FA Cup, and Arsenal became the most successful club in the history of the competition with 13 tournament wins.

====2017–19: Record-breaker and retirement====

Čech was Arsenal&#x27;s starting goalkeeper in the 2017 Community Shield, against his former club Chelsea; following a 1–1 draw after regulation time, Arsenal won the match in a 4–1 penalty shoot-out, in which neither keeper saved a spot kick.

Čech then held the armband to captain Arsenal in their 4–3 opening day home win over Leicester City.

On 11 March 2018, Čech became the first Premier League goalkeeper to keep 200 league clean sheets, after a match against Watford in which he saved a penalty from Troy Deeney.

Čech started the season as the first choice in goal for new manager Unai Emery, but later lost his place to new signing Bernd Leno after suffering a hamstring injury during a match against Watford. On 15 January 2019, Čech announced via open letter on Twitter that he would retire at the end of the season. On 29 May, he made the final appearance of his career in Arsenal&#x27;s 4–1 defeat to his former club Chelsea in the 2019 UEFA Europa League final. Several media outlets described him as Arsenal&#x27;s Man of the Match.

==International career==
===Youth===
Čech started playing for the Czech Republic at youth level. He made a combined total of 34 appearances for age groups between under-15 and under-18 between 1998 and 2000. In 2000 he moved up to the under-20 and under-21 teams, making a total of 22 appearances across those teams. Čech first came to prominence at the age of 20 at the 2002 U-21 European Championships, when he conceded only one penalty in a penalty shoot-out victory over France in the final, earning the Czech Republic their first title at youth level.

===Senior===

Čech debuted for the senior squad in February 2002 against Hungary. After establishing himself as the first choice goalkeeper, Čech was selected in the Czech Republic&#x27;s squad for UEFA Euro 2004, where he was named in the all-star team as best goalkeeper at the tournament.

====UEFA European Championships====
On 17 October 2007, Čech captained the Czech Republic team in their Euro 2008 Group D qualifier against Germany. He kept a clean sheet and the Czechs defeated Germany 3–0 away to book their place for the finals in Austria and Switzerland. In the last group game of the final tournament, Čech was beaten three times in the final 15 minutes as Turkey overcame a two-goal deficit to knock the Czechs out. Čech had a cross slip through his hands, allowing Nihat Kahveci to score Turkey&#x27;s equalising goal.

On 29 May 2012, Čech was named in the Czech Republic&#x27;s squad for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine. In the Czech Republic&#x27;s group match against Greece, a fumble from Čech allowed the Greeks a goal. Čech deputised for the injured Tomáš Rosický as captain in the final group match against Poland, as the Czech Republic qualified for the quarter-finals with a 1–0 victory. Čech&#x27;s captaincy continued in the quarter-final, where the Czechs lost to Portugal through a 79th-minute Cristiano Ronaldo goal.

====100th appearance and retirement====
On 26 March 2013, Čech made his 100th appearance for the Czech Republic, keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 win over Armenia. Čech equalled the national record of former teammate Karel Poborský on 17 November 2015, when he earned his 118th appearance in a 3–1 loss to neighbours Poland in Wrocław. The following 27 May, he took the record outright by playing in a 6–0 friendly victory over Malta.

On 8 July 2016, Čech announced his retirement from international football. He is the most capped player in the history of the Czech team, with 124 caps.

==Management career and non-contract football==
In June 2019, Čech returned to former club Chelsea as a technical and performance advisor.

In October 2020, Čech was included in Chelsea&#x27;s 25-man Premier League squad for the 2020–21 season. The club announced that Čech was included as an emergency goalkeeper and as a non-contract player, and that this was a precautionary move due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He made one appearance for Chelsea&#x27;s under-23 team in the Premier League 2.

During a protest against the proposed European Super League outside Stamford Bridge on 20 April 2021, Čech approached fans who were blocking the team bus and could be heard saying &quot;give us time&quot;. The fans did move and the team bus was able to enter after a short delay. Later that day, Chelsea were among the first clubs to withdraw from the league.

In June 2022, Čech left Chelsea after Todd Boehly took over the club.

==Ice hockey career==
On 9 October 2019, Čech signed for ice hockey side Guildford Phoenix of the National Ice Hockey League Division 2 (level 4 of British hockey) as a goaltender. He chose to wear number 39 jersey in honour of Dominik Hašek. Čech said he would continue his role as a technical and performance advisor at Chelsea whilst playing ice hockey in his spare time. He was named the man of the match on his ice hockey debut on 13 October, after stopping two penalty shots in a shoot-out victory, and making several other crucial saves. After winning a treble with Guildford Phoenix in the 2021–22 season, Čech signed for the National Ice Hockey League Division 1 side Chelmsford Chieftains in November 2022. In June 2023, after one season with Chelmsford, he signed for fellow Division 1 side Oxford City Stars.

In the 2023 off-season, Čech played for the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) defending champions, Belfast Giants, in a charity match to support the continuation of ice hockey in Ukraine (amid the Russo-Ukrainian War), raising £65,000. In November 2023, he joined the club on loan as temporary emergency cover. In an interview with the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot;, Čech revealed that he used to play youth ice hockey in addition to football, but equipment costs forced him to play the significantly cheaper sport of football. He also stated that ice hockey was his preferred sport as a child. Čech made his first and only appearance for the Giants during his initial loan spell in a 5–1 win over the Glasgow Clan on 25 November, playing for the final five minutes of the game in relief of starting goaltender Tyler Beskorowany, and making one save. He returned to his parent club in December before re-signing for the Giants on loan for a second time in the 2023–24 season in February 2024.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Since his emergence as a precocious talent in his youth, Čech has been considered to be one of the greatest, most consistent, and most respected goalkeepers both of his generation and of all time. A tall, athletic, agile, brave, physically strong, and well-rounded keeper, with a strong mentality, as well as good decision-making and leadership qualities; throughout his career he has stood out for his reflexes and shot-stopping abilities, as well as his positional sense, concentration, defence organisation, handling when coming off his line to claim crosses, and command of his area.

Although Čech is not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, he possesses a deep kick with either foot, despite being naturally left-footed. His ability to produce deep kicks and long throws came to use in his Chelsea days for starting quick counter-attacks which were an important part of their game. In his later career, he often functioned as a sweeper keeper, due to his ability to rush off his line, anticipate opponents who had beaten the offside trap, and clear the ball away from danger. Čech is also known for his penalty-saving abilities. Some examples of his penalty saves in high-profile matches include those made in the 2012 UEFA Champions League final, the 2010 FA Cup final, and his penalty save against Blackburn during the 2004–05 season, which helped him beat Peter Schmeichel&#x27;s Premier League record of 694 minutes without conceding a goal. He cited fellow goalkeepers Oliver Kahn, Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar as inspirations in his early career.

===Reception===
Čech is considered to be one of the greatest goalkeepers both of his generation and of all time, as well as one of the best keepers in Premier League history, and has earned praise from several players, pundits, and managers due to his goalkeeping ability. Fellow goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon named Čech as the best goalkeeper of his era, saying: &quot;The best goalkeeper with his feet? Pepe Reina. In the air I&#x27;d say Neuer. With his hands: Casillas. The best overall I&#x27;d say is Čech.&quot; Iker Casillas instead described him as, &quot;One of the best goalkeepers I have ever seen&quot; via his Twitter account. Former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger and goalkeeper Jens Lehmann have hailed him as &quot;one of the greatest of all time&quot;. Journalist Alan Tyers of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; described Čech as the &quot;Premier League&#x27;s best-ever goalkeeper&quot; in 2019.

Čech currently holds two Guinness World Records for the most clean sheets in English Premier League history, and for winning the Premier League Golden Glove Award with two different clubs. Nathan Baxter, Martin Dúbravka, Marek Rodák and João Virgínia are some of the goalkeepers who have described him as their idol. In 2011, Čech was voted the third best goalkeeper of the first decade of 21st century by IFFHS. He also has the third highest number of clean sheets (391) since 2000s among all goalkeepers. Former Premier League striker and record-goalscorer Alan Shearer named Čech in his Premier League&#x27;s &quot;Team of the Decade&quot; in 2019.

<text>Leland ( ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located in Leelanau County, part of the northwestern Lower Peninsula of the state. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 410. From 1883 to 2004, Leland was the county seat of Leelanau County, which has since moved to Suttons Bay Township.

Part of Leland Township, Leland is situated on an isthmus between Lake Leelanau and Lake Michigan, and is bisected by the Leland River, flowing from the former to the latter. Leland is a significant tourism destination and summer colony, and is located nearby Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Leland also serves as the departure point for ferry service to North and South Manitou Islands, both of which are wholly included in the National Lakeshore.

==History==

Leland is built on the site of one of the oldest and largest Ottawa villages on the Leelanau Peninsula. Where the Leland (Carp) River flows into Lake Michigan, there was a natural fish ladder (which was a traditional Native American fishing grounds). The settlement was called &quot;Mishi-me-go-bing&quot;, meaning &quot;the place where canoes run up into the river to land, because they have no harbor&quot;, or alternatively &quot;Che-ma-go-bing&quot; or &quot;Chi-mak-a-ping&quot;.

White settlers, who began arriving in the 1830s, also took advantage of the location as a fishing settlement. White settlement increased after Antoine Manseau, with his son Antoine Jr., and John Miller, built a dam and sawmill on the river in 1854. Construction of the dam raised the water level , and what had been three natural lakes in the river all became a single lake now known as Lake Leelanau (and is navigable all the way to the community of Cedar, about inland). The settlers built wooden docks, which allowed steamers and schooners to transport new settlers and supplies.

From 1870 to 1884, the Leland Lake Superior Iron Co. operated an iron smelter north of the river mouth, supplied with ore from the Upper Peninsula and charcoal made from local maple and beech timber; the charcoal was produced in fourteen beehive kilns near the smelting furnace, which produced up to 40 tons of iron per day. In 1884, the plant was sold to the Leland Lumber Co., which operated a sawmill on the site. Other sawmills and shingle mills operated in Leland during the years 1885–1900.

As early as 1880, commercial fishermen sailed out of the harbor to catch trout and whitefish, building wooden shacks where they processed their catch and serviced their fleet. Up to eight powered tugs once sailed out of &quot;Fishtown&quot;, as the buildings came to be known. Today, the historic fishing settlement and two fish tugs, &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;Janice Sue&quot;, are owned by a non-profit organization, the Fishtown Preservation Society. Fishtown is home to a working fishery and a thriving charter fishing business. The riverfront is lined by a boardwalk and quaint shacks that have been converted into tourist shops.

Around 1900, wealthy individuals from Chicago, Detroit, and other Midwestern industrial centers began to visit Leland and build summer cottages, arriving by Lake Michigan passenger steamer or by Lake Leelanau steamer from the railhead near Traverse City. This led to the construction of resort hotels, and the growth of Leland as a summer resort town.

==Geography==
Leland is in northern Leelanau County, on the west side of the Leelanau Peninsula. It is bordered to the west by Lake Michigan and to the east by the northern section of Lake Leelanau. The Leland River runs through the center of the community, connecting the two lakes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Leland CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.22%, are water.

Leland lies just north of the 45th parallel. A sign on M-22 south of Leland reads &quot;45th Parallel Halfway Between Equator &amp; North Pole&quot;.

<doc id="1031828" wikidata="Q3611298" url="?curid=1031828" title="Alfred Perceval Graves">
<text>Alfred Perceval Graves (22 July 184627 December 1931), was an Anglo-Irish poet, songwriter and folklorist. He was the father of British poet and critic Robert Graves.

== Early life ==
Graves was born in Dublin and was the son of The Rt Rev. Charles Graves, Church of Ireland Lord Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe, and his wife Selina, the daughter of Dr John Cheyne (1777–1836), the Physician-General to the British Forces in Ireland. His sister was Ida Margaret Graves Poore. His paternal grandmother Helena was a Perceval, and the granddaughter of the Earl of Egmont. His grandfather, John Crosbie Graves, was a first cousin of &quot;Ireland&#x27;s most celebrated surgeon&quot;, Robert James Graves.

Alfred was educated both in England, at Windermere College, Westmorland, and in Ireland, at Trinity College Dublin. As an undergraduate he contributed to the literary magazine &quot;Kottabos&quot;, starting in 1869.

His first poem appeared in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; in 1863. He graduated with a Master of Arts degree. In 1869, he entered the Civil Service as clerk in the British Home Office, where he remained until he became an Inspector of Schools in 1874.

==Author==
Graves was a contributor of prose and verse to &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, &quot;John Bull&quot;, and &quot;Punch&quot;.

For a time he lived at Red Branch House on Laurieton Road, Wimbledon, London.

He took a leading part in the late 19th-century renewal of Irish literature. He was for several years president of the Irish Literary Society, and he was the author of the comic song &quot;Father O&#x27;Flynn&quot; and many other songs and ballads. In collaboration with Charles Villiers Stanford, he published &quot;Songs of Old Ireland&quot; (1882) and &quot;Irish Songs and Ballads&quot; (1893), the airs of which are taken from the Petrie manuscripts; the airs of his &quot;Irish Folk-Songs&quot; (1897) were arranged by Charles Wood with whom he also collaborated on &quot;Songs of Erin&quot; (1901). Composer Mary Augusta Wakefield also set at least one of his poems to music.

He published an autobiography, &quot;To Return to All That&quot;, in 1930, as a response to his son Robert&#x27;s World War I memoir, &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot;.

==Later life==
Graves built a large house, named &quot;Erinfa&quot;, near Harlech, Wales, which he used as a summer retreat and where he spent his retirement. He had a keen interest in the Welsh language and the culture of Wales; he was elected as a Welsh bard in the National Eisteddfod of Wales at Bangor in 1902.

He died in Harlech in 1931.

==Legacy==
Graves’ obituary in &quot;The Spectator&quot; concluded: &quot;Mr Graves not only wrote songs but stirred up fresh public interest in the old folk-songs of Ireland, Wales and the Highlands, and, moreover, induced musicians and singers to become interested too. Keeping clear of politics, he did a great work for the popularizing of good music and good poetry in which Celt and Saxon may share.&quot;

==Family==
Graves&#x27; marriage to Jane Cooper, (29 December 187424 March 1886) of Cooper&#x27;s Hill, County Limerick, resulted in five children:

* Philip Perceval, b. 25 February 1876 (or 1870), m. Millicent Gilchrist. Died in 1953.
* Mary, b. 6 June 1877, d. circa 1949. m. Arthur Sansome Preston.
* Richard Massie, b. 14 September 1880, d. 14 August 1960, m. Eva Wilkinson, 1912.
* Alfred Perceval (&quot;Bones&quot;), b. 14 December 1881, m. Eirene Gwen Knight, singer.
* Susan Winthrop Savatier Graves, b. 23 March 1885, m. Kenneth Macaulay.

After the death of his first wife, Graves married Amalie (Amy) Elizabeth Sophie (or Sophia) von Ranke, on 30 December 1891. The couple had five children:

* Clarissa, b. 29 November 1892. Poet, artist and Christian Science practitioner.
* Rosaleen-Louise, b. 7 March 1894, d. 3 August 1989. m. James Francis Cooper.
* Robert Graves, also known as Robert von Ranke, b. 24 July 1895, d. 7 December 1985, poet, critic and author of &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; and other novels.
* Charles Patrick Ranke Graves, b. 1899, d. 1971, journalist and writer.
* John Tiarks Ranke, b. 1903, d. 1980. m. Mary Wickens.

<text>Beatrice Chase (5 July 1874 – 3 July 1955) was the pen name for a British writer known during the first half of the 20th century for her Dartmoor-based novels. Her real name was Olive Katharine Parr, and she claimed to be directly descended from William Parr, the brother of Katharine, the sixth wife of Henry VIII.

==Biography==
Beatrice Chase was born as Olive Katherine Parr in Harrow on the Hill in 1874. Her father, Charles Parr, apparently died when she was young, and her mother was a lapsed Catholic. Both Olive and her younger sister Hilda were educated at the Convent of the Holy Child in Cavendish Square, and both were baptised Catholics and became Dominican Tertiaries. Olive also took the nun&#x27;s vow of chastity.

Around 1900 she was helping the poor in London, when she contracted a lung disease, and her younger sister died. In 1901 she travelled to Devon to convalesce and spent time with her mother in the Dartmoor village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor. By 1908 she and her mother had bought a farm at Venton about south-south-east of the village. She later wrote about the discovery of the property in a book &quot;A Book of Answered Prayers&quot; that she published as Olive Katharine Parr in 1915. They rented out the farm and its outbuildings, but retained a cottage in which they lived, and built an adjacent Roman Catholic chapel which was licensed as a public oratory by Dr. Charles Graham, the Bishop of Plymouth, and for which the sacrament was reserved in 1910 until it was universally withdrawn by the Vatican in 1920.

Her first book &quot;The Voice of the River&quot; was published under her real name by Routledge in 1903. She used her real name for seven more books before starting to use her Beatrice Chase pseudonym with &quot;The Heart of the Moor&quot;, published by Herbert Jenkins in 1914. From then on she tended to use her real name only for her factual and religious writings.

During the First World War, Chase formed a &quot;Crusade for Moral Living&quot; which attracted a large following. Soldiers in the trenches and their wives or fiancées at home would write to Chase at Venton, pledging to be &quot;true to honour&quot;. In return, Chase prayed for their souls in her small chapel. She attempted to revive the crusade in World War Two, but had no success.

She was often to be seen sitting at her writing desk, beside her favourite window which provided the titles for three of her books. Here she wrote many novels and also poetry. Her passion for Dartmoor is evident in her writing and she was often referred to as &#x27;My Lady of the Moor&#x27; following the publication of John Oxenham&#x27;s novel in which she was the heroine. The book was called &quot;My Lady of the Moor&quot;, and she adopted the title.

Chase was initially welcoming to devotees of her work to her home at Venton, where she was happy to show them round and sell them signed copies of her books, but in later life she tired of them and erected notices on her property ordering &quot;trippers&quot; not to call. The popularity of her fiction declined and in 1930 she decided to become a photographer: she produced a series of postcards of Dartmoor views for Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons, and a book of 41 of her &quot;Dartmoor Snapshots&quot; was published in 1931.

As she grew older she vigorously campaigned to protect the moor from modern developments – particularly its use by the British Army – selling many of her possessions to fund this. She lived alone at Venton until 1954 when, aged 79 or 80, she was taken to hospital under the provisions of the National Assistance Act 1948 as a person in need of care and attention. Locals tell a story that she was taken to hospital in a straitjacket, but only after the loaded revolver she kept by her bed was removed.

Chase died at Newton Abbot Infirmary on 3 July 1955 and was buried in the churchyard at Widecombe-in-the-Moor. The granite cross on her grave is inscribed with &quot;Beatrice Chase 1874–1955&quot; on one side and &quot;Pray for Olive Katharine Parr&quot; on the other. It was erected in 1959 and is a reduced-size copy of Nun&#x27;s Cross.


==Legacy==
Since the second half of the 20th century, Chase&#x27;s writing style has been seen as outdated and her novels have been described as containing &quot;cardboard characters [that] move stiffly through stereotypical scenes ... uttering trite phrases of deplorable sentimentality&quot;. However, her descriptions of life on Dartmoor at the turn of the 20th century are seen as valuable.

In her last book &quot;The Dartmoor Window Forty years On&quot; (1948) she claimed to have started the tradition of Uncle Tom Cobley appearing in a smock-frock at the annual Widecombe Fair, and today she is credited as the person who instigated the practice of leaving fresh flowers on Jay&#x27;s Grave.

Each team plays one match against each of the other teams within the same group. Three points are awarded for a win, one point for a draw and zero points for a defeat.

First and second placed teams, in each group, advance to the quarter-finals.
The best third placed team and the second best third placed team, also advance to the quarter-finals.

* Tie-breaker
** If teams finish leveled on points, the following tie-breakers are used:
*# greater goal difference in all group games;
*# greater number of goals scored in all group games;
*# winner of the head-to-head match between the teams in question;
*# drawing of lots.

<doc id="1031851" wikidata="Q1432654" url="?curid=1031851" title="Helike">
<text>Helike (; , pronounced , modern ) was an ancient Greek polis or city-state that was submerged by a tsunami in the winter of 373 BC.

It was located in the regional unit of Achaea, northern Peloponnesos, two kilometres (12 stadia) from the Corinthian Gulf and near the city of Boura, which, like Helike, was a member of the Achaean League. Modern research attributes the catastrophe to an earthquake and accompanying tsunami which destroyed and submerged the city.

The remains of Helike were rediscovered in 2001 buried in an ancient lagoon near the village of Rizomylos. In an effort to protect the site from destruction, the World Monuments Fund included Helike in its 2004 and 2006 &quot;List of 100 Most Endangered Sites&quot;.

==History==

Helike was founded in the Early Bronze Age (c. 3000–2200 BC) as a proto-urban town with large rectilinear buildings and cobbled streets; walls and occupation layers rich in pottery of the Mycenaean period (c. 1750–1050 BC) were also found, becoming the principal city of Achaea. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the poet Homer states that the city of Helike participated in the Trojan War as a part of Agamemnon&#x27;s forces. In the space of a possible little Poseidon temple, beginning around 850 BC, religious artifacts like bronze and clay items such as figurines, clay chariot wheels, iron weapons, and pottery dating to the Archaic period, a bronze snake head and rare golden necklace were found.

Later, following its fall to the Achaeans, Helike led the Achaean League, an association that joined twelve neighboring cities in an area including today&#x27;s town of Aigio. Helike, also known as Dodekapolis (from the Greek words &quot;dodeka&quot; meaning &#x27;twelve&#x27; and &quot;polis&quot; meaning &#x27;city&#x27;), became a cultural and religious center with its own coinage. Finds from ancient Helike are limited to two 5th-century copper coins, now housed in Bode Museum, Berlin. The obverse shows the head of Poseidon, the city&#x27;s patron, and the reverse his trident. There was a temple dedicated to the Helikonian Poseidon. Ancient Greeks would travel to Helike to be blessed by Poseidon and to trade.

Helike founded colonies including Priene in Asia Minor and Sybaris in Southern Italy. Its temple and sanctuary of Helikonian Poseidon were known throughout the classical world, and second only in religious importance to Delphi.

===Destruction===
The ancient account puts Helike&#x27;s destruction in 373 BC, two years before the Battle of Leuctra, during a winter night. Several events were construed in retrospect as having warned of the disaster: some &quot;immense columns of flame&quot; appeared, and five days previously, all animals and vermin fled the city, going toward Keryneia. The city and a space of 12 stadia below it sank into the earth and were covered over by the sea. All the inhabitants perished without a trace, and the city was obscured from view except for a few building fragments projecting from the sea. Ten Spartan ships anchored in the harbour were dragged down with it. An attempt involving 2,000 men to recover bodies was unsuccessful. Aigion took possession of its territory.

Strabo recounts how the city was submerged by a tsunami triggered by an earthquake, and argued that this was caused by &quot;the anger of Poseidon&quot;, because the inhabitants of Helike had refused to give their statue of Poseidon to the Ionian colonists in Asia, or even to supply them with a model. According to some authorities, the inhabitants of Helike and Bura had even murdered the Ionian deputies. An account by Seneca claims the sea destroyed the city after an appearance of a comet.

About 150 years after the disaster, the philosopher Eratosthenes visited the site and reported that a standing bronze statue of Poseidon was submerged in a &quot;poros&quot;, &quot;holding in one hand a hippocamp&quot;, where it posed a hazard to those who fished with nets. The meaning of &quot;poros&quot; in ancient Greek is not fully clear, but could refer to an inland lagoon, lake, or narrow strait. Most archaeologists thought it referred to the Gulf of Corinth, but there was disagreement from Professor Dora Katsonopoulou:

Around 174 AD, the traveler Pausanias visited a coastal site still called Helike, located seven kilometres southeast of Aigio, and reported that the walls of the ancient city were still visible underwater, &quot;but not so plainly now as they were once, because they are corroded by the salt water&quot;.

For centuries after, its submerged ruins could still be seen. Roman tourists frequently sailed over the site, admiring the city&#x27;s statuary. Later the site silted over and the location was lost to memory.

 argued that the submergence of Helike might have inspired Plato to end his story about Atlantis with its submersion. Ancient scholars and writers who visited the ruins include the Greeks Strabo, Pausanias and Diodoros of Sicily, and the Romans Aelian and Ovid.

===Subsequent events===
On 23 August 1817, a similar disaster, an earthquake followed by a tsunami, occurred at the same spot. The earthquake was preceded by a sudden explosion, like that produced by a battery of cannon. The aftershock was said to have lasted a minute and a half, during which the sea rose at the mouth of the Selinous River and extended to cover all the ground immediately below Aigio (the ancient Αἴγιον). After its retreat, not a trace was left of some artillery depots which had stood on the shore, and the beach was carried away completely. In Aigio, 65 people died and two-thirds of its buildings were entirely ruined, as were five villages in the plain.

==Rediscovery==

=== Previous attempts ===
The submerged town was long a mystery for underwater archaeology. People were divided in their opinions about the exact location of Helike and produced numerous works and hypotheses:

In 1826, French diplomat and archaeologist François Pouqueville, who wrote the &quot;Voyage en Grèce&quot;; in 1851 Ernst Curtius the German archaeologist and historian who speculated about its location; in 1879 J. F. Julius Schmidt, the director of Athens Observatory, issuing a study comparing the Aegeion earthquake which occurred 26 December 1861 with an earthquake which might have destroyed Helike; in 1883 Spiros Panagiotopoulos, the mayor of Aegeion city, wrote about the ancient city; in 1912 the Greek writer P. K. Ksinopoulos wrote &quot;The City of Aegeion Through the Centuries&quot; and in 1939 Stanley Casson, an English art scholar and army officer who studied classical archaeology and served in Greece as liaison officer, addressed the problem.

Other investigators include in 1948 the German archaeologist Georg Karo; in 1950 Robert Demangel, who was from 1933 to 1948 the director of the French School of Archaeology in Athens; in 1950 Alfred Philippson, German geologist and geographer; in 1952 Spiros Dontas, Greek writer and member of the Academy of Athens; in 1954 Aristos Stauropoulos, a Greek writer who published the &quot;History of the city of Aegeion&quot;; in 1956 the Greek professor N. Κ. Moutsopoulos; in 1967 Spyros Marinatos, a Greek archaeologist who wrote the &quot;Research about Helike&quot; and in 1968 &quot;Helike-Thira-Thebes&quot;; in 1962 the Greek writer George K. Georgalas; and in 1967 Nikos Papahatzis, a Greek archaeologist who published &quot;Pausanias’ Description of Greece&quot;.

Spyridon Marinatos said that only the declaration of a third world war would obscure the discovery of Helike. In 1967, Harold Eugene Edgerton worked with the American researcher Peter Throckmorton. They were convinced that Helike was to be found on the seabed of the Gulf of Corinth. Edgerton perfected special sonar equipment for this research but permission to search was not granted by the Greek authorities.

In 1967 and in 1976, Jacques Cousteau searched for Helike, with no result. In 1979 in the Corinthian Gulf, the Greek undersea explorer Alexis Papadopoulos discovered a sunken town and recorded his findings in a documentary film which shows walls, fallen roofs, roof tiles, streets, etc. at a depth of between 25 and 45 m. &quot;Whether or not this town can be identified with Helike is a question to be answered by extensive underwater research. In any case, the discovery of this town can be regarded as an extremely interesting find&quot;, according to the Greek scientific journal &quot;Archaeology&quot;.

=== Rediscovery in 2001 ===
In 1988, the Greek archaeologist Dora Katsonopoulou, president of the Helike Society, and Steven Soter of the American Museum of Natural History launched the &quot;Helike Project&quot; to locate the site of the lost city. Ancient texts, telling the story of Helike, said that the city had sunk into a &quot;poros&quot;, which everyone interpreted as the Corinthian Gulf. However, Katsonopoulou and Soter raised the possibility that &quot;poros&quot; could have meant &quot;an inland lagoon&quot;. If an earthquake caused soil liquefaction on a large scale, the city would have been taken downward below the sea level. Also, if an earthquake caused the sections of coastline to fall into the sea, this would have created a tsunami, which in turn would have flooded the inland lagoon with the city in it. Over time, the river sediment coming down from the mountains would have filled in the lagoon hiding the city remains beneath the solid ground.

Before Helike was rediscovered, a few false starts came along the way. In 1994, in collaboration with the University of Patras, a magnetometer survey carried out in the midplain of the delta revealed the outlines of a buried building. This target (now known as the Klonis site) was excavated and a large Roman building with standing walls was found. Also a well-preserved settlement of the early Bronze Age was uncovered.

In 2001, Helike was rediscovered buried in an ancient lagoon near the village of Rizomylos. Further confirming that the discovered site belongs to Helike, the earthquake destruction layer consisting of cobblestones, clay roof tiles, and pottery was uncovered in 2012. This destruction layer is in good agreement with ancient texts on the location of Helike and earthquake effects to the city.

Excavations are being carried out in the Helike delta each summer and have brought to light significant archaeological finds dating from prehistoric times, when Helike was founded, up until its revival in Hellenistic and Roman times.

<doc id="1031852" wikidata="Q6537832" url="?curid=1031852" title="Lexington Legends">
<text>The Lexington Legends are an American professional baseball team based in Lexington, Kentucky. They are a member of the South Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, a &quot;partner league&quot; of Major League Baseball. The Legends have played their home games at Legends Field since 2001. The team was known as the Lexington Counter Clocks during the 2023 season before reinstating their original name in 2024.

==History==
The Class-A Kissimmee Cobras moved from the Florida State League to Lexington following the 2000 season and changed their name to the Lexington Legends. The 2001 season began under manager J. J. Cannon. The team finished their first regular season with 92 wins and 48 losses and first place in the sixteen-team South Atlantic League. In the postseason, the Legends defeated the Hagerstown Suns in the first round and advanced to play the Asheville Tourists in the League Championship Series. However, the series was canceled after the Legends won the first two games due to the September 11 attacks, and the Legends were declared co-champions after having gone up 2–0 before game three was canceled.

Cannon returned to manage in 2002 and led the team to another winning record, but the Legends failed to qualify for the playoffs. Lexington returned to the playoffs in 2003 but was defeated by the Lake County Captains in the first round. In 2004, the Legends finished with a record of 68–72, their first losing record in team history. The following season, the Legends posted an 81–58 regular season record and finished in first place under manager Tim Bogar.

===Roger Clemens===
On May 31, 2006, Roger Clemens announced that he would come out of retirement to pitch for the Houston Astros for the remainder of the 2006 season. Clemens, planning to keep himself to a strict 60-pitch limit, returned to baseball with the Legends, where his oldest son Koby played. Father and son denied reports that Koby would catch his dad for the return. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t listen to me,&quot; Roger Clemens said. &quot;We&#x27;d be shaking each other off and arguing too much.&quot; In his first game, Clemens threw 62 pitches, allowed no walks, and only one run while striking out 6 batters in three innings of work with the Legends, who won the game 5–1.

===Joe Mikulik incident===
The team received national attention again in 2006 following a controversial game against the Asheville Tourists on June 25. In the fifth inning of the game, Tourists manager Joe Mikulik went on an extended tirade after being ejected from the game following an argument with an umpire. The event received coverage on various television programs, including NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; and &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, and MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;. Roger Clemens&#x27; appearance as a Legend and Joe Mikulik&#x27;s meltdown are chronicled in the 2011 documentary film &quot;Legendary: When Baseball Came to the Bluegrass&quot;.

===2021 and beyond===
The Lexington Legends were one of the minor league teams that lost MLB affiliation under a new plan by MLB. On February 18, 2021, the team announced that it would be joining the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent MLB Partner league, for the 2021 season.

On October 28, 2022, the team and their ballpark were sold to Nathan and Keri Lyons.

===2023 name change===
It was announced March 6, 2023, that the team was changing its name to the Lexington Counter Clocks. For that season, their ballpark was known as Counter Clocks Field.

===2024 sale and name change===
It was announced January 25, 2024, that the team had been sold to Temerity Baseball along with several local investors. On February 15, 2024, it was announced the team would be renamed back to the Lexington Legends.

==Branding and mascots==

The Legends&#x27; mascot from 2001 to 2022 was Big L, a mustachioed baseball player caricature. His best friend was Pee Wee, another team mascot. The team&#x27;s colors were blue, green, and yellow.

Along with its new name, in 2023 the Lexington Counter Clocks introduced two new mascots: Hoss, a horse that races to the left, and Dinger, a clock swinging a bat. The team&#x27;s colors are now blue, red, and white.

Along with the name change announced on February 15, 2024, a new mascot was introduced: Mighty Lex, a baseball with arms, legs, and the same mustache worn by past mascot Big L.

==Season by season results==
Since its inception, the Lexington franchise has played 22 seasons, initially in the South Atlantic League (2001–2019) and later in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (2021–present). As of the completion of the 2022 season, the club had played in 2,886 regular season games and compiled a record of 1,400–1,486 for a .485 winning percentage. The team postseason record was 19–8.

<doc id="1031863" wikidata="Q1930251" url="?curid=1031863" title="Dear Heather">
<text>Dear Heather is the 11th studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, released by Columbia Records in 2004. It was dedicated &quot;in memory of Jack McClelland 1922-2004.&quot;

==Background==
The album features Cohen experimenting with different musical approaches. On &quot;To a Teacher&quot;, Cohen quotes himself from &quot;The Spice-Box of Earth&quot;, his second collection of poetry from 1961. The basic tracks of &quot;The Faith&quot; dated back to the &quot;Recent Songs&quot; sessions from 1979. The album includes a live version of the country standard &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;, which was taken from a performance during his tour in support of the LP &quot;Various Positions&quot;. Considering the plethora of sources from which the material sprang, Cohen had originally wanted to call the album &quot;Old Ideas&quot;, but eventually changed it to &quot;Dear Heather&quot; for fear that fans might assume it was merely a compilation or &quot;best of&quot; package (&quot;Old Ideas&quot; would be the title of Cohen&#x27;s next studio album). There is increase in spoken poetry over singing, with two songs featuring words by other writers: Lord Byron (&quot;No More a-Roving&quot;) and F. R. Scott (&quot;Villanelle for our Time&quot;). The gospel-tinged &quot;On That Day&quot; addresses the still-raw tragedy and horror of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

==Reception==
The album reached No. 131 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Internet Album charts and #5 on the Canadian Album charts. It was Cohen&#x27;s highest charting album in America since 1969&#x27;s &quot;Songs from a Room&quot;. The album&#x27;s highest chart position came in Poland where it reached #1 on the Polish Albums Chart.&quot; Dear Heather&quot; was not received as well by critics as &quot;Ten New Songs&quot; and Cohen&#x27;s 2001 live album &quot;Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979&quot; had been. Some critics found it dour - although such notices had been commonplace throughout various stages of Cohen&#x27;s career - and noted a tone of finality in the offering. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Some of the songs are virtually unadorned with poetic imagery and fall flat; in others, Mr. Cohen uses his calmly sepulchral voice for speech rather than melody. The production is homemade.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; deemed it an &quot;unsatisfying way to end such an intriguing career.&quot; In the November 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of the LP, Michaelangelo Matos praised the album, calling Cohen &quot;Canada&#x27;s hippest 70 year old&quot; and insisting that &quot;given how monochromatic Cohen tends to be, the jumbled feel works in &quot;Dear Heather&quot;&#x27;s favor.&quot; Thom Jurek of AllMusic argues that &quot;Dear Heather&quot; is Cohen&#x27;s &quot;most upbeat&quot; album: &quot;Rather than focus on loss as an end, it looks upon experience as something to be accepted as a portal to wisdom and gratitude...If this is indeed his final offering as a songwriter, it is a fine, decent, and moving way to close this chapter of the book of his life.&quot;

*&quot;Villanelle for Our Time&quot; was recorded 6 May 1999, shortly after Cohen&#x27;s return from Mount Baldy Zen Center. It is an improvised jazz recitation of a poem by F. R. Scott, Cohen&#x27;s older colleague from the Montreal Group of modernist poets.
*&quot;To a Teacher&quot; is a spoken-word track based on Cohen&#x27;s poem from his 1961 book of poetry &quot;The Spice-Box of Earth&quot;, dedicated to the Canadian poet A.M. Klein.

*The track &quot;Nightingale&quot; is dedicated to the late R&amp;B singer Carl Anderson, Anjani Thomas&#x27;s colleague. She composed the music using Cohen&#x27;s abandoned poem.
*Music track for &quot;The Faith&quot; is actually an outtake from &quot;Recent Songs&quot;, with completely new lyrics, re-mixed and with new vocals added (thus the production was co-credited to &quot;Recent Songs&quot; producer Henry Lewy). It was based on a Québec folk song.
*The final track is a live performance of &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;, recorded 9 July 1985 at the Montreux Jazz Festival. It was taken from the bootlegged radio recording and cleaned up digitally.

<doc id="1031873" wikidata="Q11689382" url="?curid=1031873" title="Walford">
<text>Walford is a fictional borough of East London in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. It is the primary setting for the soap. &quot;EastEnders&quot; is filmed at Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, towards the north-west of London. Much of the location work is filmed in nearby Watford, which was chosen for many of the exterior scenes due to its close proximity and the town&#x27;s name being so similar to Walford. Thus, any stray road signs or advertising boards which are accidentally filmed in the back of shots will appear to read Walford. Locations used in Watford include most interior and exterior church scenes of various churches, the snooker club, the County Court and Magistrates&#x27; Courts courtrooms, and the cemetery (where most of the deceased characters are interred).

The name Walford is both a street in Dalston where one of the series&#x27; creators, Tony Holland, lived and a blend of Walthamstow, where Holland was born, and Stratford. The suffix &#x27;-ford&#x27; is found throughout Britain (for example, Bradford, Guildford and Telford); it just means the first place you can cross a river. Walford&#x27;s London postcode district is E20 (real East London postcode districts only went up to E18 until 2011, when E20 was introduced to serve the London 2012 Olympic Park). Walford&#x27;s fictional tube station, Walford East, is located on the &quot;EastEnders&quot; tube map in the position normally occupied by the real Bromley-by-Bow tube station. As part of the 2010 &quot;Children In Need&quot; charity appeal, Walford became twinned with Weatherfield in a special programme uniting the two soaps &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; called &quot;East Street&quot;.

==Locations within Walford==

===Albert Square===
The main setting of &quot;EastEnders&quot; is Albert Square, where many of the characters reside. Central to the Square is the garden. The garden is home to Arthur Fowler&#x27;s (Bill Treacher) bench, which was placed there in memory of him. The bench is also known as the &#x27;Bench of Tears&#x27;, as it is often the place where characters will go and cry. One corner of the square is taken up by The Queen Victoria Public House. There is a B&amp;B and a car lot. The square&#x27;s design was based on Fassett Square in Dalston, and was given the name Albert Square after Prince Albert. The Queen Victoria, was also given its name due to this. The Queen Victoria public house, known to residents as the Queen Vic or simply &#x27;The Vic&#x27;, stands south of the square at number 46 Albert Square, where it joins with Bridge Street. East of the pub is a building with 2 flats and west of these in the southwest corner leads off to a walkway through to Turpin Way, on which the Walford Community Centre and Playground are found. To the west of the Queen Vic, across the junction with Bridge Street, is the Beale house, 45 Albert Square. Next to that is 43 Albert Square. In the southwest corner of the square is number 41. Between numbers 41 and 43 is Daisy Lane, a pathway connecting Albert Square to Victoria Square. Daisy Lane was named after the daughter of Series Designer Steven Keogh. On the west edge of The Square there are two houses 18 and 20 Albert Square, which have been knocked through as a single property and then later separated again. It was previously Walford&#x27;s B&amp;B, &#x27;Kim&#x27;s Palace&#x27;. North of the old B&amp;B is the rear of 55 Victoria Road. A row of five terraced houses line the north edge of Albert Square. The westernmost house is number 31. The property next door is split into two flats. Number 25 is the home of Dot Cotton (June Brown). The easternmost property in the terrace is number 23, which was destroyed in September 2014 by a fire. On the northeast edge of Albert Square is a car park, south of which is another terrace of three elevated properties. The northernmost house is number 5. A road leads north at the square&#x27;s northeast edge, passing by the car lot. The middle house is at 3 Albert Square. Most southerly of this terrace is number 1, originally flats with the doctor&#x27;s surgery on the ground floor, which later became a single house.

===Bridge Street===

Bridge Street is the location of the street market and shops including the café, launderette, and mini-supermarket. The café is originally named Al&#x27;s Cafe and owned by Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih) and Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), where they also operate the taxi firm OzCabs. When Ali develops a gambling addiction, he is forced to sell the café to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who manages it with his wife, Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), until he sells the business to his mother, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). Ian buys the café back following the birth of Kathy&#x27;s son, Ben Mitchell (Matthew Silver), although loses the business when he becomes bankrupt years later. Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) buys the property and employs Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman), the estranged wife of Ian, to manage it. She renames the property to Laura&#x27;s Café. Laura dies and Phil is falsely imprisoned so when Phil signs the café to his sister, Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf), she naïvely sells the business back to Ian. Ian manages the café with his wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) until they divorce and Jane wins the business in the divorce settlement. Jane sells the café to Phil and he lets his partner, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), manage it. She names the property Shirley&#x27;s Cafe. Phil sells the business to Ian, and he renames the café to Mandy&#x27;s Café. When Ian has a nervous breakdown and leaves, his daughter Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) takes control of his businesses, calling the cafe Cindy&#x27;s Café. Upon his return, Ian regains ownership of the café and when she returns to Walford, Jane manages it. A few years later, Kathy returns and when she begins managing the café, Ian renames it to Kathy&#x27;s Café. A year later, Ian sells the property to Weyland &amp; Co, a property development company, which upsets Kathy. Weeks later, Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), a business consultant for the company, gifts the café to Kathy after discovering that her father, James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) raped Kathy.

The launderette is owned by Mr Papadopolous until his death in 1992; the business passes to his son, Andonis Papadopolous and in 2016, it is passed to Andonis&#x27;s son, Apostolos Papadopolous. Apostolos sells the launderette to Phil Mitchell and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) in 2021, and Kat also sets up a taxi company called “Kat’s Cabs” in the backroom.

===Turpin Road===

Turpin Road is the location of a war memorial, bookmaker, chip shop, funeral parlour, restaurant and an upmarket bar as well as several other businesses. The name Turpin Road was chosen after the show&#x27;s creator read that the East End was the haunt of notorious highwaymen, such as Dick Turpin.

The nightclub on Turpin Road is originally named Strokes Wine Bar until George Palmer (Paul Moriarty) buys it and renames it &quot;The Cobra Club&quot;. He uses the club as a cover for his criminal business. Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha), George&#x27;s daughter, takes over the control of the club when he leaves; she renames the club &quot;The Market Cellar&quot;. Annie later sells the club to Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who renames it &quot;e20&quot;. In 1999, under Steve&#x27;s ownership, Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) is killed in the club after a struggle with Steve and Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom). Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco) and Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) buy the club from Steve, although Beppe sells his majority share to Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), who rebrands the club &quot;Angie&#x27;s Den&quot;, in memory of her parents Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Following a refurbishment, Den buys into the business and co-owns with Sharon. They sell the club to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), who renames it &quot;Scarlet&quot; after his deceased daughter. Johnny gives the club to his surviving daughter, Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton), when he is imprisoned. The start of Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) and Bradley Branning&#x27;s (Charlie Clements) relationship begins in Scarlet when Bradley is falsely blamed for spiking Stacey&#x27;s drink. A reporter from &quot;Inside Soap&quot; labelled the moment &quot;a rather unromantic start to Stacey and Bradders&#x27; love story!&quot; Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) buy the club, renaming it the &quot;R&amp;R&quot; - the initials of Ronnie and her sister, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons). Ronnie and Roxy run the club, while Jack operates as a silent partner. When Ronnie and Jack separate, Ronnie sells her share of the club to Jack, although after a fire in the club, Ronnie and Roxy each buy a share in the club. When Billy tries to woo Carol Jackson (Lindsay Coulson), Carol&#x27;s daughter Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) becomes aggressive and creates an argument between them, Stacey, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). An &quot;Inside Soap&quot; columnist labelled the argument &quot;one of our favourite catfights&quot;. Jack is later shot at the club by gang member Kylie (Elarica Gallacher), and a few months later, he sells his share of the club to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Ronnie and Roxy also sell their shares to Janine. Upon her return to Walford, Sharon becomes the R&amp;R&#x27;s bar manager and she holds her wedding to Jack at the club. At the altar, Jack jilts Sharon, leaving her saddened. Sharon is also offered a small share in the business by Phil. Janine and Sharon later sell their shares to Phil, leaving him as the sole-owner. The R&amp;R closes at some point in before Christmas 2016, and remains shut until February 2018, when Sharon decides to reopen it, with Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) as the manager. Mel plans to rename the club &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, but her son Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter) sabotages the refurbishment and rebrands it &quot;E20&quot; again in honour of his father, Steve, while infuriating Mel, who goes along with it to keep Hunter happy. When Mel&#x27;s ex-husband Ray Kelly (Sean Mahon) plans to remarry her, he buys Phil&#x27;s 50% stake in the E20 and gifts it to Mel as a wedding present. In November 2019, Mel decides to sell her half of the E20 to Ruby and later blackmails Sharon into selling her half too, leaving Ruby as the new sole-owner of the club, which she renames &quot;Ruby’s&quot;. In May 2022, Ruby puts the club up for sale and Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) discovers that her brother, Phil’s, money-laundering associate, Jonah Tyler (Mark Mooney), is planning on buying the club from Ruby. She approaches Phil with this news and they agree to outbuy Jonah, reopen the club as a wine bar and run it together; renaming it &quot;Peggy’s&quot; in honour of their late mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Co-run by Phil, Sam, Kat and Sharon, the opening night of Peggy’s was on 7 July 2022.

The Dagmar at 10 Turpin Road is first mentioned in 1986 and seen in 1987 when James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) takes over and turns it into a wine bar. After James rapes Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), the bar is burnt down on the orders of Den. The building is then used for several businesses, including Ian Beale&#x27;s (Adam Woodyatt) Meal Machine, a catering business, and a bric-a-brac shop, also owned by Ian. It also becomes a beauty salon, first called Sophisti-Kate&#x27;s, run by Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny), then Booty, run by Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Roxy&#x27;s, run by Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), and Beauty, run by Sadie Young (Kate Magowan). It returns to being a wine and cocktail bar in 2014 when Sharon Watts opens The Albert. After Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) buys half the bar and Sharon later sells her half to Vincent as well, he and his wife, Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson), run it until he is forced to sell it to pay people he owes money to and it is left empty in early 2018. Kathy buys the building in 2019, and decides to reopen it as a gay bar called The Prince Albert.

Next door to the nightclub is a building that originally housed the Snooker World snooker club. When Johnny Allen buys Angie&#x27;s Den, he buys Snooker World and merges the two together to give Scarlet a more open space. After 4 Turpin Road is again separated into two buildings in 2011, Janine Butcher uses it to house her property management business, Butcher&#x27;s Joints. After Janine&#x27;s arrest for murder, it is converted into a salon called Blades, owned by Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) until he is arrested for rape. Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris) then opens her own salon called Elysium until she is forced to close it down a few months later due to high debts. It is reopened in 2019 by Denise Fox (Diane Parish) as a salon named Fox &amp; Hair.

===George Street===
George Street is the location of an Italian restaurant, Giuseppe&#x27;s, which later becomes an Indian restaurant, The Argee Bhajee, when a new owner takes over. Walford East tube station is on George Street, which first appeared on screen in late 1985 when Lou Beale (Anna Wing) collapses outside it. On maps seen inside the station it replaces Bromley-by-Bow on the District line, although the building is in the style of the Bakerloo line stations designed by Stanley Heaps. The train sound was first heard in 1987 and the train&#x27;s first appearance was in 1988 at Lou Beale&#x27;s funeral. Trains did not appear again until 4 February 2010, when CGI was used in the show for the first time. Platforms within the station were first seen in 2011 when Charlie Slater (Derek Martin) left Walford. George Street also has a B&amp;B, King George Guest House, which opened in 2008.

Other locations seen or mentioned in the series include Victoria Square, Walford Towers, Kingsley Road, Spring Lane and the High Street. Storylines in 2017 mentioned the demolition of Walford Towers, as a means of introducing new characters to the series, although the demolition was cancelled.

<doc id="1031876" wikidata="Q259214" url="?curid=1031876" title="Rust, Burgenland">
<text>Rust (; ; ) is a city in the Austrian state of Burgenland, located on the western shore of Lake Neusiedl near the border with Hungary. With only about 1,900 inhabitants, it is the country&#x27;s smallest statutory city, as it was endowed with the rights of a royal free city by the Hungarian crown in 1681. As a &quot;Statutarstadt&quot;, it also forms an administrative district (&quot;Bezirk&quot;) in its own right. The city is famous for its wines, especially for Beerenauslese, ice wine and - especially - &quot;Ruster Ausbruch&quot;.

==History==
The settlement was first mentioned as &quot;Ceel&quot; in a 1317 deed issued by King Charles I of Hungary, its name derived from Hungarian &quot;szil&quot; for Elm, later translated into German &quot;Rüster&quot; or &quot;Rusten&quot;. The present-day Hungarian name &quot;Ruszt&quot; is again a translation from the German term. Rust&#x27;s citizens received market rights in 1470 and the privilege to mark the corks of their wine barrels with the famous &#x27;R&#x27; brand in 1524. The affluent town finally gained independence at the 1681 diet at Sopron by the order of Emperor Leopold I, King of Hungary.

With the Burgenland region, Rust passed from Hungary to the Republic of Austria in 1921.
==Politics==
Seats in the municipal assembly (&quot;Gemeinderat&quot;) as of 2007 elections:
*Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ): 10
*Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP): 8
*Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ): 1

==Twin towns==
Rust is twinned with:
* Kulmbach, Germany, since 1981.
* Tokaj, Hungary, since 2006.

<doc id="1031879" wikidata="Q1566327" url="?curid=1031879" title="Congress of Europe">
<text>The Hague Congress or the Congress of Europe was a conference that was held in The Hague from 7–11 May 1948 with 750 delegates participating from around Europe as well as observers from Canada and the United States of America.

The Congress, organized by Duncan Sandys and Józef Retinger, brought together representatives from across a broad political spectrum, providing them with the opportunity to discuss ideas about the development of European political co-operation. It was held under the auspices of the International Committee of the Movements for European Unity, subsequently to become the European Movement after the Congress.

Important political figures, such as Konrad Adenauer, Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, Pierre-Henri Teitgen, François Mitterrand (both ministers in Robert Schuman&#x27;s government), three former French prime ministers, Paul Reynaud, Édouard Daladier, Paul Ramadier, Paul van Zeeland, Albert Coppé and Altiero Spinelli, took part.

A broad range of philosophers, journalists, church leaders, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs and historians also took an active role in the congress. A call was launched for a political, economic and monetary Union of Europe. This landmark conference was to have a profound influence on the shape of the European Movement, which was created soon afterwards.

The Spanish statesman Salvador de Madariaga proposed the establishment of a College of Europe at the Congress. This would be a college where university graduates from many different countries, some only a short while before at war with each other, could study and live together.

The Congress also discussed the future structure and role of the Council of Europe. Teitgen and Maxwell-Fyfe were instrumental in creating the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms at the Council of Europe.

The Congress provided the means to heighten public opinion for European unity. On 20 July 1948, at the Hague meeting of ministers of Western European Union, Schuman&#x27;s Foreign Minister Georges Bidault proposed the creation of a European Assembly (realized in the later Council of Europe) and a customs and economic union (the later European Coal and Steel Community and the two communities of the Treaties of Rome). Thus the conclusions of the Congress became French government policy and then the subject of European governmental policy.

== Preparation of the Congress ==
The Congress was organised by the International Committee of the Movements for European Unity. The creation of a Committee for the Co-ordination of the International Movements for European Unity was agreed at a meeting in Paris on 20 July 1947 convened by Sandys and Retinger to bring together a number of existing organisations working for European unity - the European League for Economic Cooperation, the United Europe Movement, the Nouvelles Equipes Internationales and the European Union of Federalists. The European Parliamentary Union also participated in the meeting but subsequently declined to join the committee. Renamed the International Committee of the Movements for European Unity in December 1947, Sandys was elected its chairman and Retigner its Honorary Secretary.

Whilst the European Union of Federalists and the European Parliamentary Union had clear federalist objectives, the other organisations, &quot;confined themselves officially to vague formulas: they wanted to &#x27;increase and cultivate opportunities for co-operation among European nations (ELEC), &#x27;to ensure to the government of the day wide support for any action which tends towards European unity&#x27; (UEM) and in general to evolve pragmatically towards a confederal union&quot;.

== Conclusions of the Congress ==
The Congress adopted three resolutions, each prepared by a Commission: a Political Resolution, an Economic and Social Resolution, and a Cultural Resolution.

The Political Resolution reflected the attempt to find common ground between the federalists and those who favoured a more gradualist, intergovernmental approach. As Retinger subsequently recalled, &quot;There were heated debates, particularly in the Political Commission as the Federalists, led by Paul Reynaud, called for a European Constituent Assembly directly elected by the people of Europe. Others wanted a more modest consultative Assembly, more likely to prove more acceptable to the governments...for that reason the call for &#x27;the pooling and transfer of sovereign rights&#x27; prevailed over that for a &#x27;Federalist State&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Francis Reginald Scott (1899–1985), commonly known as Frank Scott or F. R. Scott, was a lawyer, Canadian poet, intellectual, and constitutional scholar. He helped found the first Canadian social democratic party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and its successor, the New Democratic Party. He won Canada&#x27;s top literary prize, the Governor General&#x27;s Award, twice, once for poetry and once for non-fiction. He was married to artist Marian Dale Scott.

==Life and work==
Scott was born on August 1, 1899, in Quebec City, the sixth of seven children. His father was Frederick George Scott, &quot;an Anglican priest, minor poet and staunch advocate of the civilizing tradition of imperial Britain, who instilled in his son a commitment to serve mankind, a love for the regenerative balance of the Laurentian landscape and a firm respect for the social order.&quot; He witnessed the riots in the city during the Conscription Crisis of 1917.

Completing his undergraduate studies at Bishop&#x27;s University, in Lennoxville, Quebec, Scott went to Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar and was influenced by the Christian socialist ideas of R. H. Tawney and the Student Christian Movement.

Scott returned to Canada, settled in Montreal, studied law at McGill University, and eventually joined the law faculty as a professor. While at McGill, Scott became a member of the Montreal Group of modernist poets, a circle that also included Leon Edel, John Glassco, and A. J. M. Smith.
Scott and Smith became lifelong friends. Scott contributed to the &quot;McGill Daily Literary Supplement&quot;, which Smith edited; when that folded in 1925, he and Smith founded and edited the &quot;McGill Fortnightly Review&quot;. After the &quot;Review&quot; folded, Scott helped found and briefly co-edited &quot;The Canadian Mercury&quot;. Scott, assisted by Smith and Leo Kennedy, also anonymously edited the modernist poetry anthology &quot;New Provinces&quot; (in which he published ten poems), which was published in 1936.
The Great Depression greatly disturbed Scott; he founded the League for Social Reconstruction (LSR) with the historian Frank Underhill to advocate socialist solutions in a Canadian context. Through the LSR, Scott became an influential figure in the Canadian socialist movement. He was a founding member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and a contributor to that party&#x27;s Regina Manifesto. He also edited a book advocating &quot;Social Planning for Canada&quot; (1935). In 1943, he co-authored &quot;Make This Your Canada&quot;, which spelled out the CCF national programme, with David Lewis. Scott was elected national chairman of the CCF in 1942, and would serve until 1950.

In March 1942 Scott co-founded a literary magazine, &quot;Preview&quot;, with the Montreal poet Patrick Anderson. Like the earlier Montreal Group publications, &quot;&quot;Preview&quot; orientation was ; its members looked largely towards the English poets of the 1930s for inspiration.&quot;

In 1950–1951, Scott cofounded &quot;Recherches sociales&quot;, a study group concerned with French–English relations. He began translating French-Canadian poetry.

In 1952, he served as a United Nations technical assistance resident representative in Burma to help build a socialist state in that country.

During the 1950s, Scott was an active opponent of the Maurice Duplessis regime in Quebec and went to court to fight the Padlock Law. He also represented Frank Roncarrelli, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, in &quot;Roncarelli v Duplessis&quot; all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, a battle that Duplessis lost.

Scott began translating French-Canadian poetry and published Anne Hébert and Saint-Denys Garneau in 1962. He edited &quot;Poems of French Canada&quot; (1977), which won the Canada Council prize for translation.
Scott served as dean of law at McGill University from 1961 to 1964 and served on the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. In 1970. he was offered a seat in the Senate of Canada by Pierre Trudeau. Although he declined the appointment, he supported Trudeau&#x27;s imposition of the War Measures Act during the October Crisis same year.

Scott opposed Quebec&#x27;s Bill 22 and Bill 101, which established the province within its jurisdiction as an officially-unilingual province within an officially-bilingual country.

After his death on January 30, 1985, Scott was interred in Mount Royal Cemetery, Montreal.

===Recognition===
Scott won the 1977 Governor General&#x27;s Award for non-fiction for his &quot;Essays on the Constitution&quot; and the 1981 Governor General&#x27;s Award for poetry for his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;.

The Royal Society of Canada elected Scott a fellow in 1947 and awarded him its Lorne Pierce Medal in 1962.

Scott won the Molson Prize in 1965.

In 1966, Scott received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University.

Leonard Cohen added music to Scott&#x27;s villanelle, &quot;A Villanelle for Our Time,&quot; and recorded it on his album &quot;Dear Heather&quot;.

Scott is the subject of a number of critical works, as well as a major biography, &quot;The Politics of the Imagination: A Life of F. R. Scott&quot; by Sandra Djwa.

<text>Erik Paul Kowalski (May 5, 1973), most known as Casino Versus Japan is an American musician who works in electronic music.

== Influences ==
As a child, Erik Kowalski was originally heavily influenced by Jan Hammer&#x27;s music for &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, as well as Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre. Kowalski taught himself piano, guitar and drums in the early &#x27;90s while in high school.
== Early work and releases ==
Recording guitar-based, ambient and experimental music as Radiogate between 1996 and 1997, Kowalski matured in the underground electronic music community in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He worked at Atomic Records for 14 years and also wrote for the alternative fanzine &quot;Milk Magazine&quot; which also informed developments within many styles of innovative music. During this time he interviewed many of his favorite artists and influences. In early 1998, he approached Mike Bailey (d. 2019) of the local electronic label Star Star Stereo with some demo tapes, and shortly thereafter, released his self-titled debut &quot;Casino Versus Japan&quot;. This subsequently led to live performances (including several dates opening for Low) with Charles Wyatt (Charles Atlas) accompanying Kowalski on guitar, as well as a subsequent tour opening for Deerhunter in 2010. In January 2000, &quot;Go Hawaii&quot; was released on CD by Wobblyhead (later on double-vinyl LP by City Centre Offices, 2001). By the Summer of 2002, the track &quot;It&#x27;s Very Sunny&quot; was used in a Hummer television commercial. His third album &quot;Whole Numbers Play the Basics&quot;, followed in September, 2002 on Carpark Records. The song &quot;Manic Thru Tone&quot; was used in MTV&#x27;s &quot;Choose Or Lose&quot; campaign in the Fall of 2002. In 2012, the title track from &quot;Go Hawaii&quot; was covered by Adam Peters for use as the incidental theme music for Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Savages&quot;.

== Collections and collaborations ==

&quot;Hitori + Kaiso (1998–2001)&quot;, a collection of unreleased tracks, appeared in 2004. The album was compiled and released by Attacknine Records from a large archive of material initially presented as a gift to Nick Huntington of Freescha, and not intended for public release. Huntington enthusiastically encouraged a release, however, which also resulted in the 2010 collection &quot;Night on Tape&quot;, another batch of selected tracks from the same archive. Casino Versus Japan and Freescha released a Split EP together in 2004.

Tracks by Casino Versus Japan have featured heavily during the intermissions of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Radiolab&quot; podcast. In July 2011 &quot;Radiolab&quot; were licensed to allow followers to download Casino Versus Japan&#x27;s &quot;Miano: A Pink Night For Snowmen&quot; from the &quot;Night on Tape&quot; album.

<text>Botanic Gardens was an early inner suburban railway station in Melbourne, Australia. It was a small station built to serve both the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Royal Botanic Gardens. The station was located near the narrow humpback footbridge from Yarra Park to Swan Street between Princes Bridge and Richmond Stations.

==History==
It was opened on 3 February 1859 by the Melbourne &amp; Suburban Railway Company, three weeks after the opening of its line to Richmond, which was later extended as the Hawthorn and Windsor lines. It had limited facilities and lacked shelter on platforms.

As it was one of the first stations in Melbourne to close, details of it are sparse. It opened only for traffic on Wednesdays afternoons, Saturdays and Sundays. It closed around 1862, although an exact date is not known. Following its closure, the area was served by trams for many years, until Jolimont railway station was opened nearby.

<text>Jeremy Michael &quot;Jay&quot; Jopling (born June 1963) is an English art dealer and gallerist. He is the founder of White Cube.

==Early life==
Jeremy Michael Jopling is the son of Michael Jopling, Baron Jopling, a Conservative politician who served for some time as Minister for Agriculture in the Conservative Government led by Margaret Thatcher. Jopling was brought up in Yorkshire and educated at Eton and the University of Edinburgh, where he studied English literature and history of art, and his first job was selling fire extinguishers door-to-door.

==Career==
As a university student, Jopling visited Manhattan, where he forged links with post-war American artists, encouraging them to donate works for the charity auction &quot;New Art: New World.&quot; In the late 1980s, he formed a friendship with the artist Damien Hirst. After completing his M.A. in 1984, he moved to London and began working with artists of his generation.

In May 1993, he opened the original White Cube on the first floor of 44 Duke Street, St James, in West End. Its exhibition policy was to provide a one-off showcase for both British and international artists. White Cube exhibited some of the leading contemporary artists, including Lucian Freud, Gilbert &amp; George, Antony Gormley, Sarah Morris, Mona Hatoum, Marc Quinn, Damien Hirst, Gary Hume, Runa Islam, Jake &amp; Dinos Chapman, Tracey Emin, Harland Miller, Sam Taylor-Wood, Gavin Turk and Cerith Wyn Evans.

In 2000, Jopling opened the larger White Cube Hoxton Square in London&#x27;s East End, occupying a converted 1920s light industrial building. The gallery space closed in December 2012. White Cube Mason&#x27;s Yard, situated off Duke Street, St James&#x27;s—home of the original White Cube—opened in 2006. White Cube Bermondsey opened in October 2012 and is the largest of the gallery&#x27;s three sites. White Cube Hong Kong, located in the heart of Hong Kong&#x27;s central district, opened in March 2012. White Cube São Paulo opened in December 2012 and closed in 2015.

Jopling&#x27;s most recent venture was a three-year programme of exhibitions in Brazil.

He was named one of GQ&#x27;s 50 best dressed British men in 2015.

==Paddle8==
Jopling invested heavily in an online auction platform called Paddle8. Paddle8 merged with competitor online auction house Auctionata in early 2016. By February 2017, Auctionata declared insolvency and Paddle8 became an independent company once again.

==Personal life==
Jopling was married to artist Sam Taylor-Wood, together they have two daughters, Angelica (b. June 1997) and Jessie Phoenix (b. November 2005). In September 2008, the couple announced that they were separating amicably after 11 years of marriage. 

He subsequently married Hikari Yokoyama, who works for Paddle8. In 2019, their daughter, Djuna Mei Jopling, was born.

<text>Stephen C. Tweedie is a Scottish software developer who is known for his work on the Linux kernel, in particular his work on filesystems.

After becoming involved with the development of the ext2 filesystem working on performance issues, he led the development of the ext3 filesystem which involved adding a journaling layer (JBD) to the ext2 filesystem. For his work on the journaling layer, he has been described by fellow Linux developer Andrew Morton as &quot;a true artisan&quot;.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1969, Tweedie studied computer science at Churchill College, Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh, where he did his thesis on &quot;Contention and Achieved Performance in Multicomputer Wormhole Routing Networks&quot;. After contributing to the Linux kernel in his spare time since the early nineties and working on VMS filesystem support for DEC for two years, Tweedie was employed by Linux distributor Red Hat where he continues to work on the Linux kernel.

Tweedie has published a number of papers on Linux, including &quot;Design and Implementation of the Second Extended Filesystem&quot; in 1994, &quot;Journaling the Linux ext2fs Filesystem&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Planned Extensions to the Linux Ext2/Ext3 Filesystem&quot; in 2002.

Tweedie is also a frequent speaker on the subject of Linux kernel development at technical conferences. Amongst others, he has given talks on Linux kernel development at the 1997 and 1998 USENIX Annual Technical Conferences, the 2000 UKUUG conference in London, and he gave the keynote speech at the Ottawa Linux Symposium in 2002.

<doc id="1031898" wikidata="Q1365509" url="?curid=1031898" title="Half hitch">
<text>The half hitch is a simple hitch knot, where the working end of a line is brought over and under the standing part. Insecure on its own, it is a valuable component of a wide variety of useful and reliable hitches, bends, and knots.

Securing an additional single hitch to the rope&#x27;s standing part produces the related knot two half-hitches.Alternatively, a half hitch may be made secure on its own by placing the final crossing opposite to the turn around the working end. This locks the end in place, and holds fast as long as the hitch is loaded by a steady pull. A half hitch in this configuration is sometimes used to tie strings to the bridge of a classical guitar.

Another instance where a half hitch stands on its own without additional embellishment is when added to a timber hitch to help stabilize a load in the direction of pull. A timber hitch is tied on the far end of the load to bind it securely and a half hitch made at the forward end to serve as a guide for the rope. In this instance, the half hitch combined with a timber hitch is known as a killick hitch or kelleg hitch.

The knot is attractive to the eye and so is used decoratively for French whipping which is also known as &quot;half hitch whipping&quot;.

<doc id="1031900" wikidata="Q5419316" url="?curid=1031900" title="Examples of feudalism">
<text>Examples of feudalism are helpful to fully understand feudalism and feudal society. Feudalism was practiced in many different ways, depending on location and period, thus a high-level encompassing conceptual definition does not always provide a reader with the intimate understanding that detailed historical examples provide.

== Western European feudalism ==
=== 10th century Normandy ===
When Rollo took Normandy from the French King Charles the Simple in 911 the ownership of Normandy was given &quot;quasi fundum et allodium&quot; — in absolute ownership, allowing Duke Rollo as seigneur to give everyday use of portions of land to his followers, in exchange for recognition of the lords&#x27; rights and agreeing to &quot;foi et homage&quot; - providing services and paying homage. This continued until 1204 when Normandy once again became part of France, except for the Channel Islands where fiefs would in future be held for the English Crown in right of the ducal title.

=== England ===

Feudalism in the 12th century Norman England was among the better structured and established in Europe at the time. However, it could be structurally complex, which is illustrated by the example of the feudal barony of Stafford as described in a survey of knight&#x27;s fees made in 1166 and recorded in &quot;The Black Book of the Exchequer&quot;. This was a roll of parchment or several such, recording the quantity and tenant of each knight&#x27;s fee held &quot;in capital&quot;. It was a record commissioned by the Treasury as the knight&#x27;s fee was the primary basis for assessing certain types of taxation, for example, feudalism is the exchange of land for military service, thus everything was based on what was called the knight&#x27;s fee, which is a fiefdom or estate of land. A feudal barony contained several knight&#x27;s fees, for example, the baron Robert de Stafford held a barony containing 60 knight&#x27;s fees. Often lords were not so much lords presiding over great estates, but managers of a network of tenants and sub-leases.

Stafford tenants were themselves lords of the manors they held from him, which is altogether different from their being barons. Henry D&#x27;Oilly, who held 3 fees from Robert de Stafford, also held, as a tenant-in-chief, over 30 fees elsewhere that had been granted to him directly by the king. Thus while Henry was the vassal of his overlord Robert, Henry was himself a lord of his manors held &quot; in capital&quot; and sub-enfeoffed many of his manors which he did not keep in demesne, that is to say under his management using simple employees. It would also have been possible and not uncommon for a situation where Robert of Stafford was a vassal of Henry elsewhere, creating the condition of mutual lordship/vassalage between the two. These complex relationships invariably create loyalty problems through conflicts of interest. To resolve this the concept of a liege lord existed, which meant that the vassal was loyal to his liege lord above all others, except the king himself, no matter what. However, even this sometimes broke down when a vassal would pledge himself to more than one liege lord.

From the perspective of the smallest landholder, multiple networks of tenancy were layered on the same small plot of land. A chronicle of the time says &quot;Different lordships lay on the land in different respects&quot;. Each tenant laid claim to a certain aspect of the service from the land.

Magna Carta was used in 1215 by the barons to force King John to respect feudal rights, limiting the power of the King by defying his rights under feudal law.

=== France ===
From the 11th century, among the complexities of feudal arrangements, there existed no guarantee that contracts between lord and vassal would be honored, and feudal contracts saw little enforcement from those with greater authority. This often resulted in the wealthier and more powerful party taking advantage of the weaker.

Such was (allegedly) the case of Hugh de Lusignan and his relations with his lord William V of Aquitaine. Between 1020 and 1025 Hugh wrote or possibly dictated a complaint against William and his vassals describing the unjust treatment he had received at the hands of both. Hugh describes a convoluted intermingling of loyalties that was characteristic of the period and instrumental in developing strain between nobles that resulted in competition for each other&#x27;s land. According to Hugh&#x27;s account, William wronged him on numerous occasions, often to the benefit of William&#x27;s vassals. Many of his properties suffered similar fates: seized by opponents and divided between them and William. William neglected to send military aid to Hugh when necessary and dealt most unfairly in the exchange of hostages. Each time Hugh reclaimed one of his properties, William ordered him to return it to whoever had recently taken it from him. William broke multiple oaths in succession yet Hugh continued to put faith in his lord&#x27;s word, to his ruin. In his last contract with William, over possession of his uncle&#x27;s castle at Chiza, Hugh dealt in no uncertain terms and with frank language:

Hugh: You are my lord, I will not accept a pledge from you, but I will simply rely on the mercy of God and yourself.
William: Give up all those claims over which you have quarreled with me in the past and swear fidelity to me and my son and I will give you your uncle&#x27;s honor [Chizes] or something else of equal value in exchange for it.
Hugh: My lord, I beg you through God and this blessed crucifix which is made in the figure of Christ that you do not make me do this if you and your son were intending to threaten me with trickery.
William: On my honor and my son I will do this without trickery.
Hugh: And when I shall have sworn fidelity to you, you will demand Chizes castle of me, and if I should not turn it over to you, you will say that it is not right that I deny you the castle which I hold from you, and if I should turn it over to you, you and your son will seize it because you have given nothing in pledge except the mercy of God and yourself.
William: We will not do that, but if we should demand it of you, don&#x27;t turn it over to us.

While perhaps an embellishment of the truth for the sake of Hugh&#x27;s cause, and not necessarily a microcosm of the feudal system everywhere, the &quot;Agreement Between Lord and Vassal&quot; is evidence at least of corruption in feudal rule.

The feudal system was almost completely wiped out in France by the revolution in 1789 by eliminating the rights of the seigneur.

=== Holy Roman Empire ===
=== Portugal ===
Portugal, originally a part of the Kingdom of León, was an example of a feudal society, according to Marc Bloch.

Portugal has its roots in a feudal state in northern Iberia, the County of Portugal, established in 868 within the Kingdom of Asturias. The Vímara Peres, the local counts&#x27; dynasty, was suppressed in 1071, but twenty-two years later, in 1093, King Alphonse VI of Léon and Castille gave the county as a fiefdom to Henry of Burgundy (a younger Capet who was participating in the reconquista), when he married Theresa, the king&#x27;s natural daughter.

Despite their vassal link, Henry had remarkable autonomy, especially after his father-in-law died in 1109. The Portuguese independence was obtained by his son, Afonso I of Portugal when, after defeating the Muslims at the Battle of Ourique, proclaimed himself King of Portugal in 1139, cutting definitively all feudal bonds with the Kingdom of León. Upon seeing the weakness of feudal society due to the Muslim invasion, Portugal became independent from the Kingdom of León as Castile had done a century earlier.

=== North American colonies ===
Semi-feudal systems accompanied colonialism in some European settlements in North America:
* Patroon system in New Netherland, which lasted until the Anti-Rent War and the New York Constitution of 1846
* Seigneurial system of New France (now Canada), which was abolished in 1854 under British rule, though transitional rent payments persisted until 1970

== &quot;Semi-feudal&quot; (non-Western European) feudalism ==
Outside of a medieval European historical context, the concept of feudalism is generally used by analogy (called &quot;&#x27;semi-feudal&quot;), most often in discussions of Japan under the &quot;shōguns&quot;, Thai sakdina and, sometimes, nineteenth-century Ethiopia. However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing it in places as diverse as Ancient Egypt, the Parthian Empire, India, and the American South of the nineteenth century.

=== Byzantine Empire ===

Pronoia, the 11th-century system of land grants in the Byzantine Empire, makes a useful contrast to feudal tenure in the European West. Another distinction between the European West can be made in that paroiki (people who lived and farmed on the land of the Pronoiars) owed no debt or loyalty to the pronoiars (the recipients of the Pronoia). This system was adopted by Serbia and then the Ottoman Empire after the fall of the Byzantine Empire at their hands, which called their land grants &quot;timar&quot; and the recipients of the land grants &quot;timariots&quot;.

=== Russia ===
In contrast to Western Europe where feudalism created a strong central power, it took a strong central power to develop feudalism in Russia. A lack of true central power weakened and doomed the Russians to outside domination. The Russians developed its system of land/lord/worker, loosely called feudalism, after it had created a strong central power. Lacking a feudal system of vassal loyalty made it impossible for any prince, early on, to gain enough influence and power to project a strong force against any invaders.

In contrast to other European forms of serfdom and feudalism there was a lack of vassalage and loyalty to the lord whose land the serfs worked. It took a much longer period for feudalism to develop but when it did it took on a much harsher form than elsewhere in Europe. Serfs had no rights whatsoever; they could be traded like livestock by their lords. They had no ownership of anything, including their own families, all of which belonged to their lord.

Another major difference was the lack of independent principalities; this was due to the lack of vassalage. Separate lords did not command their troops to protect their lands.

=== Armenia ===

The Nakharar system used by the Armenian nobility throughout Medieval Armenia has often been described as feudal, with hereditary houses of nobles owning large estates, each headed by its own tanuter, and with the estates themselves divided amongst the family. For Armenia as a whole, a Sparapet (supreme commander), King, and chief Aspet were each taken from individual noble houses. However, Armenian feudalism differs from the feudalism of most of Europe as the estates were owned by families, not lords, and could not be split or given without the family&#x27;s permission. Also, if a tanuter died heirless, he was succeeded by a different branch of the family, rather than by a noble who was sworn to him. Cilician Armenia, through contact with crusader states, had a system even closer to Western feudalism. The economic and political systems of medieval Europe in which people exchanged loyalty and labor for a lord&#x27;s protection

=== Pakistan, India and Bangladesh ===

The Taluqdari, Jotedari or Zamindari system is often referred to as a feudal or feudal-like system. Originally the system was introduced in the pre-colonial period to collect taxes from peasants, and it continued during colonial British rule. After independence Zamindari was abolished in India and East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), but it is still present today in Pakistan. In modern times historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models and today it is rare for Zamindari to be described as feudal by academics; it is still done in popular usage, however, but only for pejorative reasons to express disfavor, typically by critics of the system.

=== China ===

Feudalism is the model that modern Chinese Marxists and Tokyo school historians use to identify China&#x27;s recent past, neologized from the Chinese concept of &quot;fengjian&quot; (which means to allocate a region or piece of land to an individual, establishing him as the ruler of that region), a term used to designate the multi-state system which existed in China under the Zhou dynasty, eradicated following Qin&#x27;s wars of unification in favour of the commandery–county system.

During the Zhou dynasty, each lord was given land, and his power was legitimized by nominal allegiance to the central Zhou king; politics thus revolved around these noble households. Each local state was governed independently with taxes, currency, and laws set by the aristocratic clan chief in charge of the territory, but the nobles were required to pay regular homage to the Zhou kings as an act of fealty and acknowledgement of the king&#x27;s ritual authority. In times of war, the nobles were required to provide armed service to the king. 

Broadly, while &quot;fengjian&quot; shared several similarities with later Western feudalism, the local chiefs were afforded greater autonomy in their own territories, but the king owed them no mutual defense. The matter was further complicated by a bifurcation in territorial administration, where the western heartland of the Zhou royals was more directly governed, but certain lineages enjoyed greater independence from the royal house, which was junior to their own lineages within the Ji ancestral temple community.

Early Chinese titles were a mixture of political and kinship terms, and did not attain systematization until the late Spring and Autumn period. As the Zhou dynasty&#x27;s control weakened, the regional magnates caused further title inflation by referring to themselves as Kings; the inflation was such that under the Han dynasty, many local lords were established with the title of &quot;king&quot;; in imperial China, the character is thus more normally rendered as &quot;prince&quot;. The notion of &quot;prime minister&quot; in early China came from the aristocratic meaning of &quot;chief housekeeper&quot; or &quot;butler&quot; of a noble household, in a similar way to the development of such European titles as &quot;constable&quot;.

At the transition from the Western Zhou to the Eastern Zhou, the political power of the Zhou royal house fell sharply. The collapse of central authority led to a geopolitical situation marked by considerable infighting by the landed aristocracy and their successors, often ministerial lineages.

After the last King of Qin, known to posterity as the First Emperor of Qin, defeated his rival states, founding the first empire, he formally abolished the largely defunct system, replacing it with a bureaucratized system of literate civil servants. Despite the rapid collapse of the Qin and an abortive attempt at reinstitution of by Xiang Yu, the following Han dynasty maintained the vast majority of Qin&#x27;s bureaucratic reforms, establishing them as the new standard of government for the next two thousand years of imperial Chinese history. Han dynasty scholarship would decry the First Emperor as a tyrant whose crimes included deconstructing the system, which was misunderstood in anachronistic overly systematized form as an integral component of the idealized society of the Western Zhou. While most Chinese dynasties began with imperial relatives being granted control of some local territories, and there were many instances of aristocratic clans surpassing the power of the imperial house, officially devolved power for a military elite present in the system would not again be implemented in China.

=== Tibet ===

Whether Tibet constituted a feudal social system or if peasants could be considered serfs is still debated. Studied districts of Tibet between the 17th and 20th-century show evidence of a striated society with land ownership laws and tax responsibility that resemble European feudal systems. However, scholars have pointed out key differences that make the comparison contested and only limited evidence from that period is available for study. Scholar Geoff Samuel further argued that Tibet even in the early 20th century did not constitute a single state but rather a collection of districts and a legal system of Lhasa with particular land and tax laws did not extend over the entire country.

However, according to Melvyn Goldstein, for the 20th century, the Tibetan political system can not be categorized as feudal since Tibet possessed a centralized state.

=== Japan ===
The Tokugawa shogunate was a feudal military dictatorship of Japan established in the 17th century lasting until 1868. It marks a period often referred to loosely as &#x27;feudal Japan&#x27;, otherwise known as the Edo period. While modern historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models, in Japan, the system of land tenure and a vassal receiving tenure in exchange for an oath of fealty is very close to what happened in parts of medieval Europe, and thus the term is sometimes used in connection with Japan. Karl Friday notes that in the 21st century, historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences.

== Modern traces ==
=== Scotland ===
&quot;For full discussion, see&quot; Scots feudal law

Scots law is quite different from English law. One scholar explained it in 1924 as follows: 
: It is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combined with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.

The system of land tenure in Scotland was until recently feudal. In theory, this meant that the land was held under The Crown as the ultimate feudal superior. Historically, The Crown would make a grant of land in return for military or other services and the grantees would in turn make sub-grants for other services and so on. Those making grants – the &quot;superiors&quot; – retained a legal interest in the land (&quot;dominium directum&quot;), and so a hierarchical structure was created with each property having several owners, co-existing simultaneously. Only one of these, the vassal, has what in normal language would be regarded as ownership of the property (&quot;dominium utile&quot;).

The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 abolished the feudal system of land tenure in Scotland and replaced it with a system of outright ownership of land. Since the Act became fully effective on 28 November 2004, the vassal owns the land outright, and superiority interests disappeared. The right of feudal superiors to enforce conditions was ended, subject to certain saving provisions of a restricted nature. Feu duty was abolished although compensation may be payable. The delay between royal assent and coming into force was caused by the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before final abolition and because of the close relation that the 2000 Act has to the Title Conditions Act 2003.

=== England ===
Unique in England, the village of Laxton in Nottinghamshire continues to retain some vestiges of the feudal system in which the land is still farmed using the open field system. The feudal court now meets only annually, with its authority now restricted to the management of the farmland.

In the New Forest &quot;Common Rights&quot; created 900 years ago still exist for around 500 commoners who exercise their rights to graze certain animals and collect wood for fuel. Managed by Verderers, who uphold the law in the Court of Verderers.

=== Sark ===
The tiny island of Sark, in the Channel Islands, was arguably the last feudal state in Europe which ended after 450 years on 9 April 2008. The island was a fiefdom of the larger nearby island of Guernsey and administered independently by a Seigneur, who was a vassal to the land&#x27;s owner, the Queen of the United Kingdom. Sark&#x27;s ruling body voted on 4 October 2006 to replace the remaining tenement seats in Chief Pleas with a fully-elected democratic government, which was implemented on April 9, 2008.

=== North Korea ===
North Korea has been described as a feudal state because of its caste system, Songbun. Regular citizens can be seen as peasants, soldiers as knights, higher members at the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea as nobles and the Kim dynasty as monarchs.

<text>The Arsonists (), previously also known in English as The Firebugs or The Fire Raisers, was written by the Swiss novelist and playwright Max Frisch in 1953, first as a radio play, then adapted for television and the stage (1958) as a play in six scenes. It was revised in 1960 to include an epilogue.

==Plot==

This dark comedy is set in a town that is regularly attacked by arsonists. Disguised as door-to-door salesmen (hawkers), they talk their way into people&#x27;s homes and settle down in the attic, where they set about planning the destruction of the house. 

The central character, a businessman called Biedermann, is seen at the outset reading newspaper reports of arson, convinced that he could never be taken in. Within minutes, the first &quot;hawker&quot; has appeared (Schmitz), and through a combination of intimidation and persuasion he talks his way into spending the night in the attic. As the play unfolds, a second arsonist appears (Eisenring), and before Biedermann can do anything to stop it, his attic is piled high with oil drums full of petrol. He even helps them to measure the detonating fuse and gives them matches, refusing to believe the full horror of what is happening. He soon becomes an accomplice in his own downfall.

The action is observed by a Greek-style chorus of &quot;firemen&quot;, and the increasingly surreal flavour culminates in a final scene, the afterpiece, where Biedermann and his wife Babette find themselves at the gates of Hell. Here they once again meet Schmitz and Eisenring who turn out to be Beelzebub and the Devil respectively, who, after becoming angered at the number of mass murderers being allowed to go to Heaven, refuse to conduct a Hell for a &quot;small fry&quot; like Biedermann.

==Analysis==
The first sketch was written in 1948 in response to the Communist takeover in Prague, but the play is often seen as a metaphor for Nazism and fascism, and Frisch encourages this through several allusions. The play shows how &quot;normal&quot; citizens can be taken in by evil. As a parable, in a more general sense it may be considered to be descriptive of the gullible and easily manipulated aspects of the German Biedermann – the Everyman – who yearns both for a sense of shallow propriety and for a deeper sense of belonging, even if it comes at a great price, including that which is sensible or even necessary for his own survival. In that sense, the play shares much with absurdist plays written at around the same time, such as Eugene Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;.

The name Biedermann is itself a play on the German word &quot;bieder&quot; meaning conventional, conservative, worthy, honest, upright and is frequently used in a pejorative or ironic context. Thus the name equates to &quot;der biedere Mann&quot; or &quot;the worthy man&quot;. &quot;Bieder&quot; is associated with Biedermeier, a cultural style of the 19th century prominent for its association with a type of &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; mindset.

==Production history== 
The Fire Raisers, translated by Michael Bullock, was produced in London on December 21, 1961, at the Royal Court Theatre with Alfred Marks as Biedermann. The same translation was also presented at Bristol Old Vic in 1962, with Paul Eddington in the role of Biedermann. 
Jules Irving and Herbert Blau directed a San Francisco Actor&#x27;s Workshop production of &quot;The Firebugs&quot; on February 28, 1964. Bullock&#x27;s translation was also staged by the Edinburgh Gateway Company in the Autumn of 1964. Mordecai Gorelik, research professor of theater at Southern Illinois University, wrote the authorized English translation and directed it to positive reviews in 1964 while a visiting professor at California State University, Los Angeles, and again June 1–5, 1965 at SIU. The inmates of San Quentin Prison staged &quot;The Firebugs&quot; in June, 1965. The first United States performance that included the epilogue was directed by Edwin Duerr on May 16, 1968, at California State College, Fullerton.

During his brief tenure as Director of the Liverpool Playhouse Bernard Hepton put on the play, which featured in his effort to move the theatre’s repertoire beyond its normal fare.

A new translation of the play by Alistair Beaton entitled &quot;The Arsonists&quot;, featuring Benedict Cumberbatch, was produced at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre in November 2007, under the direction of Ramin Gray. It was also performed in 1968 at the Bristol Old Vic with Tim Pigott-Smith as one of the Fireraisers.

The play has been adapted into the opera &quot;Biedermann und die Brandstifter&quot; by Šimon Voseček (premiered in 2013 at the Neue Oper Wien in Vienna). The English version &quot;Biedermann and the Arsonists&quot;, translated by David Pountney, was performed at the Independent Opera at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in November 2015. (director: Max Hoehn, conductor: Tim Redmond).

In September, 2017, Washington&#x27;s Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company produced an updated staging of the play, almost immediately after the election of Donald Trump. The script was from the translation by Alistair Beaton and directed by Michael Garcés. The theater cast their artistic director Howard Shalwitzof as the lead actor.

Two days later, in Game 7, Hurst was sent out to pitch the decisive game for the Sox, but he left with a no-decision when Boston saw a three run lead turn into a tie in the sixth with Hurst on the mound (New York eventually won the game and the Series); Hurst pitched a total of 23 innings, most among any pitcher in the Series and allowed five earned runs.

==Early life==
Hurst grew up in St. George, Utah, the youngest of five children born to John and Beth Hurst, who divorced when he was five years old. At an early age, doctors prescribed plaster casts to correct a condition that was causing his legs to bow.

Hurst was a standout basketball player, leading Dixie High School to the state tournament in his junior and senior seasons, despite suffering a cracked vertebra as a senior, and would receive basketball scholarship offers. He played basketball at Dixie Junior College for the 1979–80 season. In 2015, Hurst told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that he would shoot hoops at Boston Celtics practices during his Red Sox days after developing a friendship with Celtics guard Danny Ainge.

Hurst has attributed his early interest and development in baseball to Kent Garrett, a coach and former Brigham Young University player who had him analyze magazine photos of pitcher windups, with Hurst practicing his own windup in front of a three-way mirror. Hurst caught the eye of MLB scouts after his junior year during an American Legion state tournament. He would average 14 strikeouts a game as a senior, compiling a 24–2 record in high school.

==Professional career==

=== Boston Red Sox ===

==== 1976–1979: Minor leagues ====
Hurst was selected by the Red Sox with the 22nd overall pick in the 1976 Major League Baseball draft. He was the 11th pitcher selected. The Red Sox assigned him to the Elmira Pioneers of the New York-Penn League, where Hurst was 3–2 with a 3.00 earned run average across nine starts.

Hurst spent the 1977 season with the Winter Haven Red Sox in the Florida State League, going 5–4 in 13 starts with a 2.08 ERA, before incurring an elbow injury.

In 1978, the Red Sox promoted Hurst to the Bristol Red Sox of the Eastern League, where he lodged six starts before having his season shut down with shoulder soreness, ending with a 1–3 record and a 2.73 ERA.

Hurst started the 1979 season with Winter Haven, going 8–2 in 12 starts with a 1.93 ERA, then finishing the year in Bristol where, across 15 starts and one relief appearance, he had a 9–4 record with a 3.58 ERA.

==== 1980–1981: MLB debut and time in Triple-A ====
Hurst made Boston&#x27;s opening day roster in 1980. He made his major league debut on April 12, coming on in relief in the second game of the season and giving up five earned runs in an inning of work in an 18–1 blowout at the hands of the Milwaukee Brewers. He made six more appearances, all starts, before being optioned to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League on May 14. He went 8–6 for Pawtucket over the next three months with a 3.94 ERA, with Boston recalling him in August to the parent club. He ended 1980 with ending the season with a 2–2 record and 9.10 ERA at the major league level.

Returning to Pawtucket for the season, Hurst went 12–7 with a 2.87 ERA. In Pawtucket, he played in the longest professional baseball game, with 32 innings played on April 18 and 19 against the Rochester Red Wings, with the final inning played later on June 23. Hurst came on as a reliever for the 28th inning and pitched five innings without giving up a run, later recollecting striking out Cal Ripken Jr. on a breaking ball at 4 a.m. prior to the league&#x27;s commissioner ordering the suspension of play at the end of the inning. Bob Ojeda was credited with the win after pitching the 33rd inning on June 23.

After spending the 1981 minor league season in Pawtucket, Hurst received a September call-up, going 2–0 in five starts with a 4.30 ERA.

==== 1982–1985 ====
Hurst became a regular in the Red Sox rotation in the 1982 season, starting 19 games with another nine relief appearances en route to a 3–7 record and a 5.77 ERA. He solidified his starting status the following season, going 12–12 with a 4.09 ERA across 32 starts and one relief appearance in 1983.

With the departures of John Tudor and Dennis Eckersley, Hurst became Boston&#x27;s top starter in 1984, getting the nod on opening day and giving up two unearned runs in innings in a 2-1 road loss to the California Angels. He bounced back with a four-hit shutout of the Oakland Athletics, then was chased from his Fenway Park home opener after giving up seven runs while recording only one out. Hurst was 12–12 on the season with a 3.92 ERA, tying with Ojeda and Oil Can Boyd for the team lead in wins and losses.

Getting off to a slow start in the 1985 season, Hurst was demoted to the bullpen for a portion of June and requested a trade. Hurst turned around his season with the addition of a forkball as a third pitch to his curveball and fastball. Hurst credited former Detroit Tigers coach Roger Craig for teaching him the concept of the forkball and former Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mike Boddicker for schooling him in the grip, confirmed later by Boddicker who described the pitch as a &quot;foshball&quot; that was essentially &quot;a glorified changeup.&quot;

Hurst said in an interview that that when his curve and forkball were fooling hitters, &quot;I think I can get by with a mediocre fastball.&quot; Hurst would later pinpoint his revival to a single moment during a July 3 game against Milwaukee when batter Paul Molitor easily fouled off a Hurst pitch, at which point Hurst recollected telling himself &quot;no more&quot; and bore down to get the strikeout, one of 10 that day for the first time in his career. With his ERA having peaked at 6.66 on June 23, Hurst would finish the season with an overall 4.51 ERA and an 11–13 record.

==== 1986: World Series ====
Hurst had gone 42–46 with a 4.59 ERA with the Red Sox before his breakthrough 1986 season, on a staff anchored by Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens. Hurst posted a 2.99 ERA with 13 victories despite spending six midsummer weeks on the disabled list with a pulled groin. The Red Sox won the American League East by 5.5 games over the New York Yankees to head to the 1986 American League Championship Series against the California Angels. Hurst went 1–0 with a 2.40 ERA in two starts in the ALCS won by the Sox in seven games.

Hurst pitched brilliantly in the World Series, holding the New York Mets to just four hits in the Game 1 pitchers&#x27; duel with Ron Darling won 1–0 by the Red Sox. In Game 5, Hurst pitched a complete game victory to give Boston a 3–2 lead in the Series.

With Boston leading 5–3 in the 10th inning of Game 6, the Mets were down to their last out with no one on base. A Red Sox World Series victory seemed likely as the Shea Stadium scoreboard was set to display &quot;Congratulations Boston Red Sox, 1986 World Champions.&quot; Hurst had been selected as the World Series Most Valuable Player, until the Mets rallied to win the game with three runs, forcing a decisive Game 7.

Oil Can Boyd was originally slated to be the Game 7 starter for Boston, but when the game was delayed a day by rain, manager John McNamara turned to Hurst. Hurst gave up just one hit through five innings, however, the Mets came back with three runs in the sixth to tie the game. Hurst got a no-decision as he handed the ball over to the bullpen. The Mets won the World Championship, and Ray Knight received MVP honors.

==== 1987–1988: Accolades and postseason return ====
Hurst had a 9–6 record and 3.81 ERA when McNamara added him to the 1987 American League All-Star team. However, he did not appear in the game. He ended the season with a middling 15–13 record as the Red Sox finished the season 20 games behind the first place Detroit Tigers.

Hurst was 9–4 with a 4.60 ERA midway through the season when the Red Sox replaced McNamara at manager with Joe Morgan, who had been Pawtucket manager during Hurst&#x27;s tenure there. The Sox were in fifth place, nine games back of the first place Tigers at the time of the managerial change. The team went 46-31 from that point forward to finish one game ahead of Detroit in the AL East.

Hurst went 9–2 with a 2.54 ERA under his new manager to end the season at 18–6, finishing fifth in balloting for the American League Cy Young Award that season. He pitched a complete game in Games 1 of the 1988 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, but was outmatched by Oakland&#x27;s ace, Dave Stewart. With Boston down three games to none, the two faced off again in Game 4 with Stewart and the A&#x27;s again emerging victorious to complete the sweep.

=== San Diego Padres ===
Hurst became a free agent following the 1988 season. He signed a three-year contract with the San Diego Padres worth $5.25 million. Hurst indicated at the time that San Diego&#x27;s relative proximity to St. George was the primary factor in his decision to leave Boston, and later expressed regret in leaving the Red Sox.

On April 10, , he pitched a one-hitter against the Atlanta Braves for his first National League win and also collected his first MLB hit as a batter. He was the first Padres pitcher to strike out 13 batters while allowing only one hit. He went 15–11 with a career-best 2.69 ERA that season and led the National League with 10 complete games.

On May 18, 1992, Hurst pitched a one-hit shutout over Dwight Gooden and the Mets. The only hit was a single by Chico Walker. At the end of the season, Hurst began feeling pain in his left shoulder and underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff and labrum. The rehabilitation was arduous, and Hurst started only twice for the Padres in the first half of , allowing 6 earned runs in innings.

=== Colorado Rockies ===
The Padres traded Hurst and Greg Harris to the Colorado Rockies on July 26, 1993 for Brad Ausmus, Doug Bochtler, and Andy Ashby. Hurst started just three games for Colorado, never finishing the fourth inning.

=== Texas Rangers ===
Hurst signed with the Texas Rangers for the season. He was 2–1 with a 7.11 ERA in eight starts through June. With the repercussions of the surgery still lingering, he decided to retire less than three months into the season.

==Career stats==

Consistently good but never overpowering hitters, Hurst was a specialist at changing speeds. His fastball was hard enough to get in on right-handed hitters, and he mixed it with an excellent curve and a slider as well. He also had a decent forkball at times. Thanks to his great control, Hurst was able to work corners well and had a profuse knowledge of each hitter. In seven postseason games, he had a 3–2 record with 37 strikeouts and a 2.29 ERA in 51 innings.

==Post-playing activities==
Hurst was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in November , on the heels of the Red Sox 2004 World Series victory, the club&#x27;s first since 1918. Believers of &quot;The Curse of the Bambino&quot; have pointed out the letters &quot;BRUCE HURST&quot; can be re-arranged as &quot;B RUTH CURSE&quot;. With his mother Beth having died in December 2003 on the eve of the Red Sox World Series win in 2004, Hurst was quoted saying years later, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure, knowing my mom, that she would have gone up and put her arm around Babe and said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s get this over with.&#x27;&quot;

In , Hurst and Jim Lefebvre coached China to a bronze medal at the 23rd Asian Baseball Championship, the first time ever that China had defeated one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; Asian teams (Japan, South Korea, Chinese Taipei). In , Hurst and Lefebvre also led the Chinese team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, where they were eliminated in the first round of competition in the Asian bracket, which also featured eventual tournament champion Japan, as well as Korea and Chinese Taipei. Hurst also coached China alongside manager John McLaren in the Asian Baseball Championship in 2012 and 2013 World Baseball Classic.

Hurst returned to the Boston Red Sox during spring training in 2008 as a pitching instructor. On February 26, 2008, Hurst was named as Special Assistant for Player Development with the Red Sox. He worked for part of the 2015 season for the Los Angeles Dodgers, serving as a talent evaluator for players in Latin America.

During his 2019 Pawtucket Red Sox Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Clemens credited Hurst for giving him the nickname &quot;Rocketman.&quot; In a 2015 interview, Hurst described Clemens as &quot;the greatest teammate ever.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hurst met his wife Holly in 1979 during offseason studies at Dixie Junior College in St. George. They married in 1981, the year he graduated. They have four children. Hurst was inducted into Dixie State&#x27;s athletic hall of fame in 2011, and the school&#x27;s baseball field is named for him.

In 1999, Hurst and his wife moved to Gilbert, Arizona.

Hurst is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<text>A houseboat is a boat that has been designed or modified to be used primarily for regular dwelling. Most houseboats are not motorized, as they are usually moored or kept stationary, fixed at a berth, and often tethered to land to provide utilities. However, many are capable of operation under their own power. 

Houseboats are largely found on small inland rivers, lakes, and streams, and in coastal harbours, especially where there is good fishing, in many countries. 

==Africa==
===South Africa===
There are a few houseboat options in South Africa, including self-drive houseboats on the Knysna Lagoon and fully catered houseboats on Lake Jozini. There have been a number of serious incidents with houseboat fires in the country. On 19 November 2016, four people died on Hartbeespoort Dam after a fire broke on a party houseboat. On 9 October 2021, a faulty engine set luxury houseboat &quot;Shayamanzi&quot; afire and led to the death of two crew members and a German tourist.

===Zambia===
In Zambia, specifically on Lake Kariba, houseboats have been around and in use since the creation of the lake in the late 1950s to early 1960s.

==Asia==
===Bangladesh===

Houseboats have become more popular as a tourist attraction due to the number of houseboats plying at Tanguar Haor. There is a large, slow-moving houseboat used for leisure trips. This service is inspired by the houseboat used by India&#x27;s famed author Rabindranath Tagore during his visit to Shilaidaha. It is about long and about wide at the middle, and has been in service since 2021. 

===Hong Kong===
There is a houseboat and fishing community on the southern side of Hong Kong Island, known as Aberdeen Floating Village. There was also one such community in the Yau Ma Tei Typhoon Shelter.

===India===
In India, houseboats used as accommodation for tourists are common on the backwaters of Kerala and also on Dal Lake near Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir (see below).

====Kerala houseboats====
Houseboats in Kerala, south India, are huge, slow-moving barges used for leisure trips. They are a reworked model of Kettuvallams (in the Malayalam language, &quot;Kettu&quot; means &quot;tied with ropes&quot;, and &quot;vallam&quot; means &quot;boat&quot;), which, in earlier times, were used to carry rice and spices from Kuttanad to the Kochi port. Kerala houseboats were considered a convenient means of transportation. First Modern House Boat In Kerala developed by Thomas Vargheese in Kottayam in the time of Dr. Babu Paul IAS. The popularity of Kettuvallams has returned as major tourist attractions.

These houseboats are about long and about wide at the middle. Kerala houseboats are characterized by their thatched roofs made of bamboo and palm leaves, supported by a sturdy wooden hull. The construction involves traditional techniques, where the planks are tied together using coir ropes without a single nail, ensuring flexibility and strength. The boat exterior is painted with protective coats of cashew nut oil.
====Kashmir houseboats====

Unlike their counterparts in Kerala, the houseboats in Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir — the northernmost state of India — are usually stationary, generally moored at the edges of Dal Lake and Nageen Lake. Some houseboats there were built in the early 1900s and are still being rented out to tourists. These houseboats are made of wood and usually have intricately carved wood paneling. They are of different sizes, some having up to three bedrooms apart from a living room and kitchen.
===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, a floating house is called as &quot;rumah apung&quot;. An example of a floating house in Indonesia is called &quot;rumah rakit&quot; (Indonesian: raft house), which is a type of traditional house found in riverine realm of South Sumatra, which is thought to have existed since the time of the Srivijaya kingdom. Raft houses are built on rafts and float along the banks of the Musi River, Ogan River and Komering River. To avoid the raft drifting away, the raft house is tied to a &quot;serdang&quot; (tether).

===Laos===
In Laos, houseboats are used to accommodate tourists on the Mekong River. Usually referred to as &quot;slow boats&quot;, the houseboats exist in wooden or steel variants.

==Europe==

===Germany===

The Port of Hamburg has a sizable water-borne community that includes a &quot;Flussschifferkirche&quot;, or Boatman&#x27;s Church. Berlin also has some houseboat neighborhoods, notably on the Landwehrkanal in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.

===Netherlands===

In Europe, some of the finest and costliest examples of houseboats can be seen along the canals of Amsterdam, which even have houseboat hotels. Houseboats are very expensive in Amsterdam because of the limited number of moorings. This expense has reduced the likelihood that the approximately 2,400 families that live on the inner waters of Amsterdam will find themselves confronted by new neighboring boats. The &quot;bloemenmarkt&quot; is a houseboat-borne flower market along the Singel in Amsterdam. The town of Maasbommel is pioneering floating houses, with flexible connections for fluids and electricity, intended not primarily for travel, but rather safety against flooding.

Amsterdam has what may be the world&#x27;s only houseboat museum, located on a renovated cargo ship built in 1914 and opened by its current owners to the public in order to answer questions people often have about life on houseboats. 

=== Poland ===
Poland is the world&#x27;s second largest producer of motor yachts, up to 9 meters in length after the United States. Poland has extensive experience in the production of modern and stylish houseboat yachts and floating houses. Houseboat recreation is practicing in the Masuria District and on the Vistula River and lakes close to the Baltic seaside.

According to Zegluj.pl, the largest houseboat rental service in Poland, there are about 100 new units for charter every year.

===Serbia===

Houseboats are popular for recreation, dining and clubbing in Serbia. They can be seen in large numbers in Belgrade on the banks of the Danube and Sava Rivers, and on river islands. 

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, houseboats come under various authorities depending on where they are moored. Those that usually do not move from year to year and are in marinas come under local authorities. Those moored on tidal waters (estuaries and coastal harbours) come under various authorities. Most navigable inland waterways in England and Wales come under the authority of either the waterways managed by Environment Agency (EA, sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) or the waterways managed by the Canal and River Trust (CRT). Scotland, Northern Ireland and some additional waterways in England and Wales have their own authorities (see the List of navigation authorities in the United Kingdom).

Both the EA and the CRT distinguish between powered vessels (including sail) and unpowered houseboats. The EA defines Launches as &quot;any mechanically propelled vessel not being used solely as a tug or for the carriage of goods&quot;, and houseboats that &quot;includes any pleasure boat which is not a launch and which is decked or otherwise structurally covered in and which is or is capable of being used as a place of habitation&quot;. The CRT, which manages 2,000 miles of inland waterways, requires any houseboat moored on their waterways to have a houseboat certificate. The CRT defines a houseboat as &quot;&#x27;a boat whose main use is for a purpose other than navigation and which, if needed for the purpose, has planning permission, for the site where it is moored&#x27;. A houseboat may be used for navigation from time to time provided it does not become its main use&quot;.

The CRT definition provides a large grey area about what a houseboat is, because owners of a narrowboat, or other inhabitable vessels (see list of the types of canal craft in the United Kingdom) who live on board may choose to define their boat either as a cruising vessel and pay for a cruising licence, or obtain a houseboat certificate. The decision often depends on which is cheapest and whether the CRT, or the local authority overseeing a marina&#x27;s planning permission, allows moorings to be residential (meeting the local authority&#x27;s requirements allowing permanent residence aboard at the mooring), or leisure (inhabitability only for short periods).

==North America==
===Canada===
Toronto&#x27;s Bluffer&#x27;s Park is home to a small float home community with 24 properties within the park&#x27;s marina. A city bylaw states that no more than 25 floating homes can be built. The homes in Toronto are built on concrete barges chained to the lake bottom and docked at the marina to allow residence year round. These homes have no motor and thus are not vessels.

Ladner&#x27;s Canoe Pass Village is a small float home community along the Fraser River near Westham Island, located along River Road in West Ladner, in the Port Guichon neighborhood. It was opened in 1985 as Canada&#x27;s first legalized floating home community.

===United States===

==== Houseboat communities ====

The US has many houseboat communities. Portland, Oregon, is the largest. Many houseboats are moored along both the Willamette River and the Columbia River, with the neighborhood of Hayden Island a prominent example. Float houses are mostly used on the Pacific coast.

Seattle, Washington, is home to a relatively large collection of houseboats (capable of moving under their own power) or &quot;floating homes&quot; (houses built on floats) in several neighborhoods, particularly in Lake Union and Portage Bay. These began to appear soon after the time of first European settlement. At their peak in the first half of the 20th century, there were over 2,500 such homes in the city, not even counting seaworthy liveaboard boats. From the outset, they included floating slums of shabby shacks, but gentrified houseboats go back at least to 1888 when the Yesler Way cable car reached Leschi on Lake Washington and a string of luxury summer getaways (none surviving today) lined the shore from there north to Madison Park. , there were about 480 floating homes on Lake Union and a lesser number elsewhere in the city. 

Sausalito, California, has one of the most noted collections of float homes owned at various times by famous musicians, film stars, authors, and other notables, from the hippie era until even today. Nearby Belvedere&#x27;s houseboats date to the late 1800s, and houseboats in the area were homes to railway men shipping logs to San Francisco via the ferry at Sausalito. Like many areas where float homes have taken hold, battles have brewed between float home owners, local and state government, and the local establishment — which includes land-based home owners. Float home owners had fought established land-based tax schemes whereby float home owners sought relief from real estate taxes. The state won the battle with the shadow tax allowing the state to make the case that property beneath the float home was improved by the shadow the float home cast upon the bottom.

On the other side of the country, the nation&#x27;s capital of Washington, DC, has a major houseboat community: the Wharf Marina (expanded to 400 boat slips from the former Gangplank Marina, a name by which it is still referred to by many locals) on the Potomac River. It is a popular destination for summer holidays in Washington.

New York City also has a number of houseboat communities. As of 1999, the city was estimated to have several hundred houseboats scattered across its five boroughs. 

==== Houseboating options ====

Rental of houseboats has become popular. In addition, houseboats have been used in commerce. For example, in the Northern Neck of Virginia, Chesapeake National Bank had a floating bank branch called the Boat &#x27;n Bank that provided bank services to watermen. Halibut Cove, Alaska has one of the only floating post offices in the US. Mystic Island, New Jersey, had a &quot;botel&quot; (hotel for boaters with water access) when it started in the 1960s but the building has since changed ownership and no longer operates as such.

Houseboating is a very popular recreational activity for groups of people of all ages, aboard houseboats of all varieties ranging from more modest 30-to-40-foot boats to 70-foot (21 m)-plus luxury houseboat models. Alternatives to traditional houseboats include flybridge cruisers and catamarans also providing overnight accommodation up to a week. 

Houseboating&#x27;s appeal is due to the ability it provides to more completely explore the local scenery; remain in close proximity to other outdoor activities (hiking, boating, beaches, etc.); and retain the potential to move the living quarters on a whim for a change of view or neighbors.

Recreational houseboating in the United States started in the late 1940s when people were looking to stay on the water for longer periods of time. Lake Cumberland in Kentucky is considered the birthplace of houseboating in the US. Most of America&#x27;s manufactured houseboats are in the counties surrounding Lake Cumberland. Kentucky has more lake-style houseboats than any other place in the world, and the state is known as the &quot;Houseboat Capital of the World&quot;, although one of its towns, Monticello,has also been labeled with that honor more directly.

Houseboating on Lake Powell in Utah and Arizona is a popular vacation option, since Arizona&#x27;s Glen Canyon Dam impounds water from the Colorado River to form almost of shoreline. Popular spots for houseboats on other lakes include Lake Mead, the largest man-made lake in North America, about 30 minutes from Las Vegas; and two California lakes, New Bullards Bar Reservoir in the Sierra Nevada foothills about 45 minutes from Nevada City and Lake Shasta in the mountains just outside Redding. Four rivers or &quot;arms&quot; merge to create this: the Sacramento, McCloud, Squaw Creek, and Pit. Shasta Dam, the highest center spillway dam in the world, can be found at the southwest corner of the lake. Lake Shasta Caverns, can be reached only from the lake.

Houseboating is also common on Lake Cumberland, which is often referred to as the Houseboat Manufacturing Capital of the World because the majority of American-built houseboats are manufactured in the counties surrounding the lake. Lake Cumberland and other lakes in the southeastern US such as Norris Lake (Tennessee), Dale Hollow Lake (Kentucky/Tennessee), Center Hill Lake (Tennessee), and Lake Lanier (Georgia), to mention a few in that area, offer very favorable houseboating conditions as the geography provides a vast number of coves and fingers that allow houseboats to tie up or anchor away from the main channel and provides the user a peaceful, secluded atmosphere. Due to the large number of houseboat manufacturers located in the Southeast US, the new and used houseboat marketplace there is one of the most competitive and affordable areas for houseboats to be purchased in the nation. Houseboat transporters can also deliver a houseboat to any body of water in the US. Houseboating is also popular on Lake Amistad, Trinity Lake, Lake Mohave and Lake Mead National Recreation Area. In New York, houseboats have also become a major part of the great South Bay on Long Island. Houseboats are also available for rental at Lake Billy Chinook in Central Oregon, where waterskiing is popular. Lake Billy Chinook has many little coves to anchor the houseboat.

Roughly built float houses are sometimes called shanty boats but may be built on a raft or hull. In historic logging operations, workmen sometimes used an ark as a mobile dwelling.

==Oceania==
===Australia===

In Australia, especially on the Murray River (most notably the town of Mannum) and the sunny coastline of Queensland there are many motorized, pontoon-based houseboats with two or more bedrooms; some of these houseboats have more than one level or multiple stories (floors). Some are privately owned as either a primary residence or a holiday shack. Many are also available for hire (rent) as self-driven holiday destinations with accommodation for four to perhaps a dozen persons. Coomera River, the Great Sandy Straits (near the world&#x27;s largest sand island - Fraser Island) and, in recent times, the Tweed River (near Barri Island during the popular Tournament Crabbing competitions) are especially popular with Queenslanders and interstate tourists. Lake Eildon in Victoria. The Hawkesbury River near Sydney in New South Wales has over 120 kms of river open to houseboats and alternatives. These include flybridge cruisers and catamarans, which also offer overnight accommodation, yet are more manoeuvrable, easier to drive and have the ability to go further afield than the traditional houseboats and have the feel of true boating. Houseboats can be limited to locations because they cannot pass under bridges safely due to manoeuvrability.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand houseboating is developing as a holiday activity. Whangaroa Harbour on Northland&#x27;s east coast is a land locked harbour that provides houseboating.

==South America==
===Venezuela===
In Maracaibo, Venezuela, there is a big house called La Casa Barco (the Ship House), which was built by a former captain of the Venezuelan Navy in the 20th century. The building resembles a ship with its anchors, lifeboats, and radars, floating on water. It is located in the neighbourhood of La Estrella, and has become a city icon for tourists.

==Carbon monoxide from gasoline-powered generators==

Many houseboats use gasoline-powered generators. The carbon monoxide (CO) exhaust from these generators has caused problems for some houseboat inhabitants. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in tandem with the US National Park Service and the U.S. Coast Guard, performed a number of evaluations on air quality, particularly carbon monoxide levels, on houseboats beginning in August 2000. Since that initial investigation, over 600 boating-related poisonings in the United States have been identified, over 100 of which caused death. Over 250 of the poisonings occurred on houseboats, more than 200 of which were attributed to generator exhaust alone. Some houseboat and generator manufacturers have begun working with these agencies to evaluate engineering controls to reduce CO concentrations in occupied areas on houseboats.

<doc id="1031931" wikidata="Q3555318" url="?curid=1031931" title="Bura (Achaea)">
<text>Bura (also Boura, Bira; ) was an ancient polis (city-state) of Achaea, Greece, one of the 12 cities of the Achaean League.

It is said to have derived its name from Bura, a daughter of Ion and Helice.

The city was situated on a height 40 stadia from the sea, and southeast of Helike. Its name occurs in a line of Aeschylus, preserved by Strabo. It was swallowed up by the earthquake which destroyed Helike in 373 BCE, and all its inhabitants perished except those who were absent at the time. On their return they rebuilt the city, which was visited by Pausanias, who mentions its temples dedicated to Demeter, Aphrodite, Eileithyia and Isis. Strabo relates that there was a fountain at Bura called &quot;Sybaris&quot;, from which the river and city in Magna Graecia, Italy derived its name. On the revival of the Achaean League in 280 BCE, Bura was governed by a tyrant, whom the inhabitants slew in 275 BCE, and then joined the confederacy. A little to the east of Bura was the river Buraïcus; and on the banks of this river, between Bura and the sea, was an oracular cavern of Heracles surnamed Buraicus.

The ruins of Bura have been discovered nearly midway between the rivers of Bokhusia (Cerynites), and of Vouraikos (Buraicus) near Trupia. Ovid says that the ruins of Bura (which he calls &quot;Bira&quot;), like those of Helike, were still to be seen at the bottom of the sea. Pliny the Elder makes the same assertion. Hence it has been supposed that the ancient Bura stood upon the coast, and after its destruction was rebuilt inland; but neither Pausanias nor Strabo states that the ancient city was on the coast, and their words render it improbable. Seneca claims the sea destroyed the city after a comet appeared in the sky. Modern scholars tentatively identify the ruins at the &quot;kastro&quot; near Diakofto with Bura.

<doc id="1031933" wikidata="Q230576" url="?curid=1031933" title="Back to Jerusalem movement">
<text>The Back to Jerusalem movement () is a Christian evangelistic campaign that began in mainland China by Chinese believers to send missionaries to all of the Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim peoples who live &quot;between&quot; China and Jerusalem. They believe that the Back to Jerusalem movement is a call from God for the Chinese church to preach the gospel and establish fellowships of believers in all countries, cities, towns, and ethnic groups between China and Jerusalem.

== History ==
The Back to Jerusalem idea was initially conceived during the 1920s by the Jesus Family church in Shandong province. While the vision eventually lost traction in the Jesus Family, the Northwest Spiritual Movement would split from the Jesus Family and revive the original vision. Simon Zhao became the main leader of this movement in the 1940s. In 1946, another group in Henan province, the Back to Jerusalem Evangelistic Band, independently developed a similar vision. However, government restrictions and persecution forced the movement to go underground for decades, and its leader Simon Zhao spent 31 years in prison in Kashgar.

Since 2003, the most vocal international proponent of &quot;Back to Jerusalem&quot; has been the exiled Chinese house church leader Liu Zhenying, also known as &quot;Brother Yun&quot;. Yun intended for &quot;Back to Jerusalem&quot; to evangelize fifty-one countries by sending a minimum of 100,000 missionaries along the Silk Road, an ancient trade route that winds from China to the Mediterranean Sea. The ongoing work of evangelism, both within China and beyond its borders, is done anonymously by Chinese church members, who make no appeals for money or seek any publicity for themselves.

== Criticism ==
There has been some criticism of the Back to Jerusalem movement from both inside and outside China. According to the researcher Kim-kwong Chan, some see the movement as a &quot;hoax.&quot; He further sees as problematic the spirit of missionary martyrdom and its ethnocentric claim of China&#x27;s role in bringing the gospel on its final leg. Ezra Jin of Beijing Zion Church has made a distinction between the movement within China and those promoting it from outside China, arguing that a stronger biblical theology of mission does not encompass a Zionist theology but underscores the need for the church in China to have a global mission which brings all to God&#x27;s reign.

<doc id="1031936" wikidata="Q4052379" url="?curid=1031936" title="Unexpand">
<text>unexpand is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to convert groups of space characters into tab characters. 

For example:
$ echo &quot; asdf sdf&quot; | unexpand | od -c
0000000 \t \t a s d f s d f \n
0000014
$ echo &quot; asdf sdf&quot; | od -c
0000000
0000020 a s d f s d f \n
0000032
Here the echo command prints a string of text that includes multiple consecutive spaces, then the output is directed into the unexpand command. The resulting output is then displayed by the octal dump command od. At the second prompt, the same echo output is sent directly through the od command. As can be seen by comparing the two, the unexpand program converts sequences of eight spaces into single tabs (printed as &#x27;\t&#x27;).

<text>Fu Xiaoqing (, born 24 August 1941), better known by her pen name Dai Qing (), is a journalist and activist for China-related issues; most significantly against the Three Gorges Dam Project. She left the Chinese Communist Party after the bloodshed of 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre and was thereafter incarcerated for ten months at maximum security facility Qingcheng Prison. Dai is also an author who has published many influential books, articles, and journals.

==Early life and education==
Fu Xiaoqing was born 24 August 1941 in Chongqing, Sichuan. Her father was Fu Daqing, an activist from Jiangxi who had studied Russian in Moscow and participated in armed rebellions in Nanchang and Guangzhou; her mother, Feng Dazhang (alternatively known as Yang Jie), had good family connections and had trained as a petroleum engineer in Japan. Both were Chinese Communist Party (CCP) activists and had begun doing intelligence work for the CCP following the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. They had two more children after Xiaoqing. In 1944 or 1945, Japanese occupation forces arrested Daqing and executed him. Feng was also arrested, but eventually released.

After the Second World War ended, Xiaoqing and her mother moved to Beijing. Xiaoqing was subsequently adopted by revolutionary leader and politician Ye Jianying, a friend of her father&#x27;s, and she was raised as part of his family. Xiaoqing started school and began using the name Fu Ning. Her middle school provided students with a strong liberal arts education, and Fu read widely as a child, becoming familiar with classic Russian and Western European literature before discovering American authors as a young adult. Her mother remarried.

From 1960 to 1966, Fu studied automatic missile guidance systems at the Harbin Institute of Military Engineering. While a student she also became a formal member of the CCP.

==Career==

=== Technician and spy ===
After graduating in 1966, Fu was briefly employed at a research institute of the Number Seven Ministry of Machinery Industry, working on gyroscopes for intercontinental ballistic missile guidance systems. When the Cultural Revolution started that year, Fu joined the Red Guards, but soon began feeling disillusioned with the movement&#x27;s political leaders. Although she had not yet reached the politically mandated age for marriage and parenthood, Fu married Wang Dejia, a model research worker she had met at the Ministry research institute. The couple soon had one child, a daughter.

From 1968 to 1971, Fu and Wang were sent to attend governmental cadre schools in Zhanjiang and Dongting Lake, where they were forced to work as labourers on a remote farm. Their daughter was taken away and given to another family to raise during this period, and Fu was not permitted to leave the farm to visit her, even though she sent most of her monthly earnings to support the child. They did not see their daughter again until after their release from farm work. In 1972, Fu and her husband returned to Beijing and worked as technicians in a surveillance equipment factory under the Ministry of Public Security. From 1978 to 1979, Fu took English lessons at the PLA Foreign Languages Institute in Nanjing. She had noticed a widespread lack of children&#x27;s books for Chinese children and was interested in translating English books for her daughter.

Fu published a short story in November 1979 – her first published work – and at this point began using the name Dai Qing. While studying at the Foreign Languages Institute, she had been recruited by the Chinese army&#x27;s intelligence department. Because of her writing skills and English ability, she was assigned to join the Chinese Writers Association, make foreign contacts, and spy on writers taking part in international exchange programs. Her career as a spy turned out to be short-lived: her cover was blown by a colleague who gave a list of army personnel to the CIA, and Dai subsequently left the army in 1982.

In 1982, she left the Army and joined &quot;Guangming Daily&quot; (光明日報) as a news reporter.

===Early life as a journalist===

In 1966, Dai Qing graduated from the Harbin Military Engineering Academy (哈爾濱軍事工程學院), predecessor of National University of Defense Technology. After graduation, she furthered her studies in Japan to become an oil engineer, and she was also trained as a missile engineer. In the same year, she worked as an engineer in a top secret plant which specialized in intercontinental missiles. After working as an engineer, she started her career as a writer/news reporter.

She was noticed in 1969 when the Guangming Daily published her short story which depicted the plight of a husband and a wife separated during the Cultural Revolution. As a result, she joined the Chinese Authors Association (中國作者協會) in 1982. After publishing the short fiction, &quot;Pan&quot; (&quot;盼&quot;), she was paid high tribute as an author.

She then became a reporter for the &quot;Guangming Daily&quot; (光明日報) (&quot;Enlightenment Daily&quot;) and she remained as a columnist from 1982 to 1989. Dai was the first Chinese journalist to announce the views and points of dissidents — people such as astrophysicist Fang Lizhi (方勵之), who held different political views.

At that time, Dai was a dedicated patriot. She once said that she would die if Mao Zedong (毛澤東) needed her to do so—but after three to five years, she gradually changed her stance. Dai wanted to understand her community and the lives of ordinary citizens through the eyes of a journalist. She hoped to be able to contribute to the community.

Dai has a quixotic style of sudden asides in her writing, which may occasionally confuse the reader. At times, her biting sarcasm may be lost on those not intimately acquainted with China&#x27;s political and journalistic culture.

===Opposition against the Three Gorges Dam===

In 1979, when Dai Qing returned from France to China, she was sent south to cover the Sino-Vietnamese War. At that period, she decided to reveal the dark side of the Three Gorges Dam. As a famous and fearless China journalist and writer, Dai hoped her writing would encourage Chinese people to speak out and avoid repeating past mistakes. Thus, she openly opposed the Three Gorges Dam Project (三峽工程) on the Yangtze River (長江) in 1989. She regarded the project as &quot;the most environmentally and socially destructive project in the world&quot;.

She collected a lot of information on the project which led to the publication of the book &quot;Yangtze! Yangtze!&quot; (是否该进行长江三峡水坝的工程). The information included interviews and essays from the Chinese scientists and journalists who also opposed the project. During the period, a conference was held in the Hall of Chinese People&#x27;s Political Forum about the Three Gorges Dam, and Dai was the only reporter who attended and reported the forum. She even went to Japan in 1996 to ask the Japanese government not to provide loans or any kind of financial assistance for that project.

She argued that there was already serious emigration today, either legal or illegal, from China to other countries, like Canada, the United States, Europe and so on. The project would create a large number of refugees who had to find a place for them to reside. As a result, the legal or illegal emigration problem would be aggravated. In addition, the project would have had global effect on the climate. Dai claimed that there was a potential risk for both the Yangtze River (長江) and the Yellow River (黃河) to dry up, leading the sandstorms in Inner Mongolia to have a greater influence on Korea, Japan and even the west coast of the United States.

===Life as a prominent journalist===

Besides publishing &quot;Yangtze! Yangtze!&quot;, she also authored many books to share her opinions, especially about the Three Gorges Dam project such as &quot;The River Dragon Has Come!&quot; (水龍來了!). However, &quot;Yangtze! Yangtze!&quot; was banned after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.

Because of that event, she was denounced on June 4, 1989, and quit the Chinese Communist Party on June 5, 1989.

===Turning point for Dai===

Dai Qing took part in the opposition of the Three Gorges Dam project because, as a journalist, she thought that the project was environmentally destructive. Around 1986, a group of old respected Chinese scientists, including Zhou Peiyuan 周培源 and Lin Hua (林華), visited Three Gorges to inspect the region for dam construction. One day a conference was held in the Hall of the Chinese People’s Political Forum about Three Gorges which The Ministry of Media told the press not to report. As the only journalist who went to the conference, Dai did not know much about the Three Gorges Dam project. However, after the conference, she found the scientists to be very reasonable.

Dai&#x27;s turning point came in 1987 when she made a visit to Hong Kong. She saw that every journalist and intellectual were free to express their opinions on the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River, and she was touched by their concerns for China. However, since the Chinese media was controlled by the Chinese government, even citizens who were most susceptible to the disastrous effects of the Three Gorges Dam project knew nothing about the disadvantages of building the dam. She felt ashamed because the Hong Kong media was way ahead of China&#x27;s. Extremely anxious, Dai felt that it was her responsibility to let people know the opposing views about the Three Gorges Dam project. Therefore, she decided to publish a book to voice her concerns. Eventually she met a writer named Lin Feng, and after he discovered her concerns about the Three Gorges, he mailed her all the Hong Kong newspaper articles related to this issue.

===Life in prison===
In 1989, the student protest movement broke out. Dai Qing joined other scholars by calling on the government to curtail corruption and support democratic reform. When students staged large protests that included a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square, Dai Qing made a passionate speech there, encouraging students to leave peacefully to avoid bloodshed. If they stayed, she warned, they could provoke a violent crackdown that could seriously set back the process of reform. She was not heeded, and the crackdown came on June 4.

After the incident, many scholars either went into hiding, were detained, or fled overseas. Dai Qing, not knowing whether to flee or not, only managed to make phone calls everyday to comfort her friends and relatives. According to one of her famous books, &quot;Wo de Ruyu&quot; (&quot;My Imprisonment&quot;; 我的入獄), Dai mentioned that the police had visited her the day before her imprisonment as a way of warning her. However, she did not plan to run away for her life because she loved her country. She said, &quot;As a citizen of a country, I cannot leave her. And I have to criticise it in order to build a more perfect and stronger one.&quot;

Dai Qing was arrested in July 1989 and imprisoned on the charge of &quot;advocating bourgeois liberalization and instigating civil unrest.&quot; She spent the next ten months at maximum security facility Qingcheng Prison. She was formally denounced by her former co-workers at &quot;Guangming Daily&quot;, and in September of that year the Press and Publication Bureau banned domestic sales of her writings.

Upon her release in May 1990, Dai Qing was forbidden from further publication within China. The government kept her under surveillance and restricted her ability to travel. She was offered political asylum by the United States and Germany, but turned them both down. Instead, she wrote a book about her time in Qingcheng titled &quot;My Imprisonment&quot; (我的入獄), which she was able to have published in Hong King and Taiwan. Her daughter graduated from Beijing University that year, but was denied further opportunities for study after she refused to formally denounce her mother.

In her book, she said, &quot;What I can fight for is to let others know I am innocent but have a rebellious spirit.&quot;

As a former reporter for the Guangming Daily, she used to write frequently. However, her imprisonment after the publication of the &quot;Yangtze! Yangtze!&quot; made her change. From &quot;Wo de Ruyu,&quot; she declared she would no longer be a reporter. Since she was no longer a member of the Communist Party, she said, &quot;They (the Communist Party) will probably give me up, but I will not be glad to work with them neither.&quot;

===Later life===
Dai Qing argues that China has not yet abolished the mode of collective society from the previous eras. Therefore, she continues to fight for human rights, democracy, and environmentalism along with people in both China and the West.

From 2003–2004, Dai Qing held the position of Weissberg Chair in Human Rights and Social Justice at Beloit College, spending time in residency on campus.

In 2009, Dai Qing and poet Bei Ling were scheduled to speak at a Frankfurt Book Fair event about contemporary issues in China. However, the event was jointly hosted with China (the book fair&#x27;s guest of honour that year), and both writers were removed from the list of speakers after Chinese officials demanded their exclusion. Dai Qing told press she would be attending the fair even if she were not permitted to formally speak. The following year, after jailed human rights activist Liu Xiaobo was named a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, his wife Liu Xia asked other Chinese activists and dissidents to attend the award ceremony in support of him, and Dai Qing confirmed that she would be among those in attendance.

As of 2016, Dai Qing was living in Shunyi, Beijing, and continuing to write.

==Fellowships and awards==
From 1991–1992, Dai Qing held a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University. In recognition of work supporting freedom of the press, she received the 1992 Golden Pen of Freedom award from the World Association of News Publishers, and a PEN International Award. In 1993 she was awarded a Goldman Environmental Prize and the Condé Nast Traveler Environmental Award, and accepted a fellowship at the Columbia University School of Journalism. She used her time there to complete research for her book &quot;Wang Shiwei and &quot;Wild Lilies&quot;: Reflection and Purges in the Chinese Communist Party, 1942–1944&quot;.

She held a fellowship at the Woodrow Wilson International Center from 1998–1999, and in 2007 she took up a year-long fellowship at Australian National University.

#Members of Falungong in an Autocratic Society 2000: Dai Qing contended that China was still based on the mode of collective idea of the previous era. While the members of Falungong gathered together to cultivate their own ideas and worshipped their own god, the Chinese government saw it as a kind a deviation. She criticized the Chinese government for deploying the usual tactics of suppression to crush against Falungong members. Dai claimed that this event represents the greatest conflicts when China steps towards modernity.
