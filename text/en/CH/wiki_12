<text>John Bodkin Adams (21 January 18994 July 1983) was a British general practitioner, convicted fraudster, and suspected serial killer. Between 1946 and 1956, 163 of his patients died while in comas, which was deemed to be worthy of investigation. In addition, 132 out of 310 patients had left Adams money or items in their wills.

Adams was tried and acquitted for the murder of one patient in 1957, while another count of murder was withdrawn by the prosecution in what was later described as &quot;an abuse of process&quot; by the presiding judge, Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin, causing questions to be asked in Parliament about the prosecution&#x27;s handling of events. Adams was found guilty in a subsequent trial of thirteen offences of prescription drug fraud, lying on cremation forms, obstruction of justice during a police search and failing to keep a dangerous drugs register. He was struck off by the General Medical Council in 1957 and reinstated in 1961 after two failed applications.

Adams&#x27;s first trial was described as &quot;one of the greatest murder trials of all time&quot; and dubbed the &quot;murder trial of the century.&quot; The trial also established the doctrine of double effect, whereby a doctor giving treatment with the aim of relieving pain may lawfully, as an unintentional result, shorten life. Because of the publicity surrounding Adams&#x27;s committal hearing, the law was changed to allow defendants to ask for such hearings to be held in private. Furthermore, although a defendant had not been required within recorded legal history to give evidence in his own defence as part of the right to silence in England and Wales, the judge underlined in his summing-up that no prejudice should be attached by the jury to Adams not doing so.

Scotland Yard&#x27;s files on the case were initially closed to the public for 75 years and would have remained so until 2033. Following a request by historian Pamela Cullen, special permission was granted in 2003 to reopen the files, which have since been used by several researchers.

==Early years==
John Bodkin Adams was born and raised in Randalstown, Ulster, Ireland, into a deeply religious family of Plymouth Brethren, an austere Protestant sect of which he remained a member for his entire life. His father, Samuel, was a preacher in the local congregation and a watchmaker by profession; he also had a passionate interest in cars which he would pass on to John. In 1896, Samuel was 39 years of age when he married Ellen Bodkin, aged 30. John was their first son, followed by a brother, William Samuel, in 1903. In 1914, Adams&#x27;s father died of a stroke. Four years later, his brother died in the 1918 influenza pandemic.

After attending Coleraine Academical Institution for several years Adams matriculated at The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast at age 17. There he was seen as a &quot;plodder&quot; and &quot;lone wolf&quot; by his lecturers and, partly because of an illness (probably tuberculosis), he missed a year of studies. He graduated in 1921, having failed to qualify for honours. In 1921, surgeon Arthur Rendle Short offered Adams a position as assistant houseman at Bristol Royal Infirmary. He spent a year there but did not prove a success. On Short&#x27;s advice, Adams applied for a job as a general practitioner in a Christian practice in Eastbourne, Sussex.

==Eastbourne==

Adams arrived in Eastbourne in 1922, where he lived with his mother and his cousin, Sarah Florence Henry. In 1929, he borrowed £2,000 (equivalent to £100,753 at 2022 prices) from a patient, William Mawhood, and bought an eighteen-room house called Kent Lodge, in Trinity Trees (then known as Seaside Road), a select address. Adams would frequently invite himself to the Mawhoods&#x27; residence at mealtime, even bringing his mother and cousin. He also began charging items to their accounts at local stores without their permission. MrsMawhood would later describe Adams to the police as &quot;a real scrounger&quot;. When Mr Mawhood died in 1949, Adams visited his widow, uninvited, and took a 22-carat-gold pen from her bedroom dressing table, saying he wanted &quot;something of her husband&#x27;s&quot;. He never visited her again.

Gossip regarding Adams&#x27;s unconventional methods had started by the mid-1930s. In 1935, he inherited £7,385 from a patient, Matilda Whitton; her whole estate amounted to £11,465, equivalent to £416,489 and £646,588 respectively at 2022 values. Whitton&#x27;s will was contested by her relatives but upheld in court, though a codicil giving Adams&#x27;s mother £100 was overturned. Adams then began receiving &quot;anonymous postcards&quot; about him &quot;bumping off&quot; patients, as he admitted in a newspaper interview in 1957. These were received at a rate of three or four a year until the Second World War, and then commenced again in 1945.

In 1939 or 1941, Adams started injecting a Mrs.Agnes Pike with drugs, including morphine. After some time in his care, Mrs.Pike&#x27;s health deteriorated so much that the family, alerted by the proprietor of the guest house Mrs.Pike was in, called another doctor named Philip Mathew. Mathew established that there was no medical reason for MrsPike to be treated. Adams&#x27;s drugs, notably the morphine, put her in such a state that she was unable to recall her own name or age. She was removed from Adams&#x27;s care and after about eight weeks she made an almost full recovery; she regained her mental faculties and was well enough to go out and do her own shopping. This was a rare case of Adams&#x27;s victim surviving.

Adams stayed in Eastbourne throughout the war, and in 1941 he gained a diploma in anaesthetics. He worked one day a week in a local hospital, where he acquired a reputation as a bungler: he would fall asleep during operations, eat cakes, count money, and even mix up the anaesthetic gas tubes, leading to patients waking up or turning blue. In 1943 his mother died, and in 1952 his cousin Sarah developed cancer. Adams gave her an injection half an hour before she died.

Adams&#x27;s career was very successful; the journalist Rodney Hallworth later claimed that by 1956 he was reputed to be the wealthiest doctor in England, although without citing any evidence. A similar, and similarly unsourced, claim that &quot;he was probably the wealthiest GP in England&quot; was made by Cullen. Adams attended some famous and influential people in the region, including MP and Olympic medal winner Lord Burghley, society painter Oswald Birley, Admiral Robert Prendergast, industrialist Sir Alexander Maguire, the 10th Duke of Devonshire, Eastbourne&#x27;s Chief Constable Richard Walker and many businessmen.

After years of rumours and Adams having been mentioned in at least 132 wills of his patients, on 23 July 1956 Eastbourne police received an anonymous call about a death. It was from Leslie Henson, the music-hall performer, whose friend Gertrude Hullett had died unexpectedly while being treated by Adams.

==Police investigation==
On 23 July 1956, the day MrsHullett died, the Eastbourne coroner notified Walker that from his post-mortem her death did not appear to be natural. The police began taking statements from individuals who had been in contact with her shortly before her death, many of whom believed that she had committed suicide. One of her friends, who was also her executor, provided three letters she had written in April 1956 and had placed with her will, which indicated that she had contemplated suicide then. A second post mortem conducted by a Home Office pathologist concluded that the cause of death was barbiturate poisoning.

After the second post-mortem, the investigation was taken over from Eastbourne police on 17 August 1956 by two officers from the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Murder Squad. The senior officer, Detective Superintendent Herbert Hannam of Scotland Yard, was known for having secured a conviction in the Teddington Towpath Murders in 1953, although the defence counsel, Peter Rawlinson, called into question Hannam&#x27;s evidence on how the confession was obtained. In view of the opinion Hannam later expressed, that detectives must sometimes ignore the law, his methods are open to question. He was assisted by Detective Sergeant Charles Hewett. Hannam was in the unusual position that, instead of having to find a suspect for a known crime, he had a known suspect in Adams but needed to link him to more serious crimes than forging prescriptions, making false statements and mishandling drugs. Devlin suggests that Hannam became fixated on the idea that Adams had murdered many elderly patients for legacies, regarding his receiving a legacy as grounds for suspicion, although Adams was generally only a minor beneficiary.

Investigators decided to focus on cases from 1946 to 1956. Of the 310 death certificates examined by Home Office pathologist Francis Camps, 163 were considered by Camps to be worthy of further investigation. This was because, firstly, a very high some 42% of all 310 of Adams&#x27;s deceased were diagnosed as having died of cerebral thrombosis or cerebral haemorrhage against an average in the late 1950s of around 15% for elderly, bedridden patients, and secondly the 163 certificates related to Adams&#x27;s patients who had died while in a coma could be suggestive of the administration of a narcotic or barbiturate as well as the cause stated. The police took numerous statements from nurses who had treated Adams&#x27;s patients and their relatives. Some were generally favourable to him, but others claimed Adams had given patients &quot;special injections&quot; of substances that were unknown to the nurses and which Adams refused to disclose to them. The statements also claimed that his habit was to ask the nurses to leave the room before injections were given and that he would also isolate patients from their relatives, hindering contact with them. However several of the witnesses whom Hannam had questioned orally refused to give sworn statements to confirm their allegations against Adams. During the trial, the assertions of MrsMorrell&#x27;s nurses that they did not know what Adams was injecting or that he did not give injections in front of them were disproved by the contents of their own notebooks.

===Obstruction===

On 24 August the British Medical Association (BMA) sent a letter to all doctors in Eastbourne reminding them of &quot;Professional Secrecy&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; patient confidentiality) if interviewed by the police. The police were frustrated by this move, although some local doctors ignored it and gave statements relating either to deceased patients or, in one instance, one who was alive. The action of the BMA was part of a concerted attempt to secure better terms for its members, whose pay had remained virtually static since the National Health Service had been set up in 1948; this action later led to talk of an all-out strike.

The Attorney-General, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller (who customarily prosecuted cases of poisoning or delegated them to the Solicitor General), wrote to the BMA secretary, Angus Macrae, &quot;to try to get him to remove the ban&quot;. The impasse continued until on 8 November Manningham-Buller met Macrae to convince him of the importance of the case. During this meeting, in a highly unusual move, he passed Hannam&#x27;s confidential 187-page report on Adams to Macrae. His intention was to convince the BMA of the seriousness of the accusations and the need to obtain cooperation from local doctors. Macrae took the report to the President of the BMA and returned it the next day. Convinced of the seriousness of the accusations, Macrae dropped his opposition to doctors talking to the police.

It has been speculated that Macrae also copied the report and passed it on to the defence, and conspiracy theorists have claimed that Manningham-Buller did so intending to assist the defence case, but there is no evidence of this. However the incident does call Manningham-Buller&#x27;s competence into question, and he was strongly criticised at the time.

On 28 November 1956, opposition Labour Party MPs Stephen Swingler and Hugh Delargy gave notice of two questions to be asked in the House of Commons regarding the affair, one asking what &quot;reports [the Attorney-General] has sent&quot; to the General Medical Council (GMC) in the &quot;past six months&quot;. Manningham-Buller replied that he had &quot;had no communications&quot; with the GMC, but only with an officer of it. He did not mention the report. Instead, he instigated an investigation into a leak, later concluding that Hannam himself had passed information regarding the meeting with Macrae to a journalist, probably Rodney Hallworth of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

===Meeting Hannam===

On 1 October 1956, Hannam met Adams, who asked, &quot;You are finding all these rumours untrue, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; Hannam mentioned a prescription Adams had forged: &quot;That was very wrong [...] I have had God&#x27;s forgiveness for it&quot;, Adams replied. Hannam brought up the deaths of Adams&#x27;s patients and his receipt of legacies from them. Adams answered: &quot;A lot of those were instead of I don&#x27;t want money. What use is it? I paid £1,100 super tax last year.&quot; Hannam later mentioned, &quot;Mr Hullett left you £500.” Adams replied, &quot;Now, now, he was a life-long friend [...] I even thought it would be more than it was.&quot; Finally, when asked why he had stated untruthfully on cremation forms that he was not to inherit from the deceased, Adams said: 
Oh, that wasn&#x27;t done wickedly, God knows it wasn&#x27;t. We always want cremations to go off smoothly for the dear relatives. If I said I knew I was getting money under the Will they might get suspicious and I like cremations and burials to go smoothly. There was nothing suspicious really. It was not deceitful.

===Search===

On 24 November, Hannam, Hewett and the head of Eastbourne CID, Detective Inspector Pugh, searched Adams&#x27;s house with a warrant issued (in Pugh&#x27;s name) under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951. When told they were looking for &quot;morphine, heroin, pethidine and the like&quot;, Adams was surprised: &quot;Oh, that group. You will find none here. I haven&#x27;t any. I very seldom ever use them,” he said. When Hannam asked for Adams&#x27;s Dangerous Drugs Register, which was at that time the record of those controlled drugs ordered, but not how they were used, Adams responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you mean. I keep no register.&quot; He had not kept one since 1949, although such failures were not uncommon at that period. When shown a list of dangerous drugs he had prescribed Morrell, and asked who administered them, Adams said, &quot;I did nearly all. Perhaps the nurses gave some but mostly me.” This was later contradicted by the contents of the nurses&#x27; notebooks produced during his trial. Hannam then observed, &quot;Doctor, you prescribed for her 75 [heroin tablets of () each] the day before she died.&quot; Adams replied, &quot;Poor soul, she was in terrible agony. It was all used. I used them myself[...] Do you think it is too much?&quot;

Devlin suggested that Hannam generally considered what a suspect said in interrogation was the best form of evidence, and that the police and prosecution case was based to a significant degree on admissions that Hannam had recorded Adams making. He considered that Hannam&#x27;s records were reasonably accurate, although putting emphasis on matters that might assist a prosecution, as was the practice at the time. However Devlin considered that proof of guilt should be based as far as possible on facts rather than pre-trial statements to the police, and that an admission had to be taken as a whole, so that Adams&#x27;s statement that he had used all 12 grains or 75 tablets of heroin could not be divorced from his claim that Mrs Morrell was in terrible agony.

Adams opened a cupboard for the police: amongst medicine bottles were &quot;chocolates – slabs stuck – butter, margarine, sugar&quot;. While the officers inspected it, Adams walked to another cupboard and slipped two objects into his jacket pocket. Hannam and Pugh challenged him and Adams showed them two bottles of morphine; one he said was for Annie Sharpe, a patient and major witness who had died nine days earlier under his care; the other said &quot;Mr Soden&quot;. Soden had died on 17 September 1956, but pharmacy records later showed he had never been prescribed morphine. Adams was later (after his main trial in 1957) convicted of obstructing the search, concealing the bottles and failing to keep a Dangerous Drugs register. Later at the police station, Adams told Hannam:
Easing the passing of a dying person isn&#x27;t all that wicked. She [Morrell] wanted to die. That can&#x27;t be murder. It is impossible to accuse a doctor.

In the basement of Adams&#x27;s house, the police found, &quot;a lot of unused china and silverware. In one room there were 20 new motor car tyres still in their wrappings and several new motor car leaf springs. Wines and spirits were stored in quantity.&quot; Hallworth reports that Adams was stockpiling in case of another World War. On the second floor, &quot;one room was given over to an armoury [:] six guns in a glass-fronted display case, several automatic pistols&quot;. He had permits for these. Another room was used &quot;wholly for photographic equipment. A dozen very expensive cameras in leather cases&quot; lay around.

===Sexuality===

Adams became engaged around 1933 to Norah O&#x27;Hara but called it off in 1935 after her father had bought them a house and furnished it. Various explanations have been suggested: Surtees suggests that it was because Adams&#x27;s mother did not want him to marry &quot;trade&quot; though he also quotes a rumour that Adams wanted O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s father to change his will to favour his daughters. Adams remained friends with O&#x27;Hara his whole life and remembered her in his will.

In December, the police acquired a memorandum belonging to a &quot;Daily Mail&quot; journalist, concerning rumours of homosexuality between &quot;a police officer, a magistrate and a doctor&quot;. The &quot;doctor&quot; directly implied Adams. This information had come, according to the reporter, directly from Hannam. The &#x27;magistrate&#x27; was Sir Roland Gwynne, Mayor of Eastbourne (1929–31) and brother of Rupert Gwynne, MP for Eastbourne (1910–24). Gwynne was Adams&#x27;s patient and known to visit every day at 9:00a.m. They went on frequent holidays together and had spent three weeks in Scotland that September. The &#x27;police officer&#x27; was the Deputy Chief Constable of Eastbourne, Alexander Seekings. Hannam interviewed Gwynne on 4 February 1957, following which Gwynne severed all connection with Adams. Hannam&#x27;s record of the interview does not refer to any homosexual acts (which were a criminal offence in 1956), and the police instead gave the journalist a dressing-down.

===Arrest===

Adams was first arrested on 24 November 1956 on 13 charges including false representation on cremation certificates and granted bail. He was arrested on 19 December 1956 and charged with the murder of Mrs.Morrell. When told of the charges, he said:
Murder... murder... Can you prove it was murder? [...] I didn&#x27;t think you could prove it was murder. She was dying in any event.

Then, while he was being taken away from Kent Lodge, he reportedly gripped his receptionist&#x27;s hand and told her: &quot;I will see you in heaven.&quot;

Hannam considered he had collected enough evidence in at least four of the cases for prosecution to be warranted: regarding Clara Neil Miller, Julia Bradnum, Edith Alice Morrell and Gertrude Hullett. Of these, Adams was charged on one count: the murder of Morrell, but with the death of Mr. and Mrs.Hullett being used to prove &#x27;system&#x27;. Although it was usual in 1956 for only one count of murder to be indicted, evidence of other suspected murders not being tried could be given, provided each such instance would, on its own facts, be capable of proof beyond reasonable doubt and strikingly similar to the case tried.

===&quot;Adams and Eves&quot;===

On 22 February 1957, the police were notified of a libellous and potentially prejudicial poem about the case titled &quot;Adams and Eves&quot;. It had been read at the Cavendish Hotel on the 13th by the manager in front of 150 guests. An officer spent ten days investigating and discovered a chain of hands through which the poem had passed and been recopied to be redistributed. The original author was not discovered; an unnamed Fleet Street journalist was suspected.

==Patients==

===Edith Alice Morrell===

Morrell was a wealthy widow who suffered a stroke on 24 June 1948 while visiting her son in Cheshire. She was partially paralysed and was admitted to a hospital near Chester, where she received morphine injections for nine days from 27 June, prescribed by a Dr. Turner. Cullen suggests that Adams, supposedly her usual doctor, arrived there on 26 June, the day before she was first prescribed morphine for the pain. However, the Attorney-General&#x27;s opening speech states that Mrs.Morrell was transferred to Eastbourne on 5 July 1948, only then becoming one of Adams&#x27;s patients, and that he first prescribed morphine on 9 July, adding heroin on 21 July. Mrs.Morrell was not expected to live more than six months or so, but survived her stroke for over two years, suffering also from arthritis. Between July 1948 and August 1950, she received routine evening injections of morphine and heroin and her condition was stable, but from then, as her condition deteriorated, the dosages increased. An expert witness for the prosecution claimed that Mrs.Morrell would have become addicted, but the only apparent symptoms of this were attributed by the defence&#x27;s expert to a second stroke.

Mrs.Morrell left an estate of £157,000 and made eight cash bequests of between £300 and £1,000. Cullen claims that in some of the several wills she made Adams was bequeathed large sums of money and her Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (valued at £1,500). This appears incorrect and, in her will of 5 August 1950, the only outright bequest Mrs.Morrell made to Adams was a chest of silver cutlery worth £276. This will also awarded him a contingent right to the car and a Jacobean court cupboard, but only if Mrs.Morrell&#x27;s son predeceased her, which Devlin noted was unlikely. A codicil of 13 September 1950 cut Adams out of her will completely. and she died on 13 November 1950 aged 81 without any further changes to her will. Adams certified the cause of death as &quot;stroke&quot; and on inspecting the body, slit her wrist to ensure she was dead. Despite the last codicil, Mrs.Morrell&#x27;s son gave Adams the Rolls-Royce which was 19 years old, and the chest of silver cutlery. After Mrs.Morrell&#x27;s death, he also took away an infrared lamp she had bought herself, worth £60. Adams billed Morrell&#x27;s estate for 1,100 visits, costing £1,674 in total. The police estimated that Adams had visited Morrell a total of 321 times during her treatment. On her cremation form, Adams stated that &quot;as far as I am aware&quot; he had no pecuniary interest in the death, thereby avoiding the necessity of a post-mortem.

===Gertrude Hullett===

On 23 July 1956, Gertrude Hullett, another of Adams&#x27;s patients, died aged 50. She had been depressed since the death of her husband four months earlier and had been prescribed sodium barbitone and sodium phenobarbitone. She had told Adams on frequent occasions of her wish to commit suicide. When questioned by the coroner, Adams said that he personally gave Mrs.Hullett two barbiturate tablets each morning, initially of 7 grains each, a normal dose, later reduced to two tablets of 6 grains each, then 5 grains. However, he did not ensure that she took both tablets daily and no attempt had been made to retrieve any that had been prescribed to the late Mr. Hullett but unused when he died.

On 17 July, Hullett wrote out a cheque to Adams for £1,000 – to pay for an MG car her husband had promised to buy him. Adams paid the cheque into his account the next day, and on being told that it would clear by the 21st, asked for it to be specially cleared – to arrive in his account the next day. On 19 July, Hullett is thought to have taken an overdose and was found the next morning in a coma. Adams was unavailable and a colleague, Dr. Harris, attended to her until Adams arrived later in the day. Not once during their discussion did Adams mention her depression or her barbiturate medication. They decided a cerebral haemorrhage was most likely. On 21 July, Dr. Shera, a pathologist, was called in to take a spinal fluid sample and immediately asked if her stomach contents should be examined in case of narcotic poisoning. Adams and Harris both opposed this. After Shera left, Adams visited a colleague at the Princess Alice Hospital in Eastbourne and asked about the treatment for barbiturate poisoning. He was told to give doses of 10 cc of Megimide every five minutes, and was given 100 cc to use. The recommended dose in the instructions was 100 cc to 200 cc. Dr. Cook also told him to put Hullett on an intravenous drip. Adams did not.

The next morning, at 8:30, Adams called the coroner to make an appointment for a private post-mortem. The coroner asked when the patient had died and Adams said she had not yet. Harris visited again that day and Adams still made no mention of potential barbiturate poisoning. When Harris had left, Adams gave a single injection of 10 cc of the Megimide. Hullett developed broncho-pneumonia and on the 23rd at 6:00a.m. Adams gave Hullett oxygen. She died at 7:23a.m. on 23 July. The results of a urine sample taken on 21 July were received after Hullett&#x27;s death, on the 24th. It showed she had 115 grains of sodium barbitone in her body – twice the fatal dose.

An inquest was held into Hullett&#x27;s death on 21 August. The coroner questioned Adams&#x27;s treatment and in his summing up said that it was &quot;extraordinary that the doctor, knowing the past history of the patient&quot; did not &quot;at once suspect barbiturate poisoning&quot;. He described Adams&#x27;s 10 cc dose of Megimide as another &quot;mere gesture&quot;. The inquest concluded that Hullett committed suicide: it was described as a &quot;travesty&quot; as, in the opinion of Cullen, with an ongoing police investigation, the inquest should have been adjourned until the investigation had concluded. However, the coroner asked Superintendent Hannam whether the police wished him to adjourn the inquest, to which Hannam replied that he had no application to make. After the inquest, the cheque for £1,000 disappeared.

Hullett left Adams her Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn (worth at least £2,900) in a will written five days before her overdose. Adams sold it six days before he was arrested.

==Before the trial==

===Case selection===

Charles Hewett, Hannam&#x27;s assistant, was quoted as saying that both officers were astounded at Manningham-Buller&#x27;s decision to charge Adams with the murder of Morrell since her body had been cremated and therefore there was no evidence to present before a jury. This assertion was published after the deaths of both Hannam and Manningham-Buller.
This shows a misunderstanding of the principle of corpus delicti, and his assertion that traces of drugs found in exhumed remains were more compelling as proof against Adams was disputed by Devlin, as the exhumations and subsequent post-mortems yielded nothing of interest. and as the pathologist concerned did not consider that the levels found were significant. Cullen also describes Morrell as &quot;the weakest&quot; case of the four the police deemed most suspicious. Devlin, who regarded none of the cases mentioned by Hallworth as being as strong as the Morrell case, despite it being six years old, suggested that, in an investigation covering a ten-year period, the police were unable to find a better case than the Morrell one.

In 1957, it was the job of the police to investigate reported crimes, to determine if one had been committed and to arrest a suspect. It was then the job of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), or in very serious cases of the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General, to review the police case and decide whether to prosecute and, in more serious cases, what offences to prosecute. What to prosecute depends on legal issues and Devlin states that, to succeed in the murder case against Adams, the prosecution had to show, firstly, there had been an unnatural death, secondly, an act by Adams was capable of being murderous (such as an injection so large as to cause death) and finally Adams&#x27;s intent to kill. The Attorney-General thought he had evidence that Adams had prescribed large quantities of opiates to Mrs.Morrell, Adams&#x27;s own admissions that he had used them all on Mrs.Morrell and injected all or almost all of them himself, and a medical expert&#x27;s testimony that the only possible reason to inject so much over a short time was to kill her.

Cullen mentions Mrs.Morrell, Mr. and Mrs.Hullett, Clara Neil Miller and Julia Bradnum as cases that Hannam regarded as warranting prosecution. However, in the cases of Mr.Hullett, Clara Neil Miller and Julia Bradnum there was no certainty of an unnatural death, as there was evidence in the committal hearing that Mr.Hullett died of a heart attack and, at their exhumations, the pathologist concluded Miller had died from pneumonia, and the condition of Bradnum&#x27;s body did not allow a cause of death to be stated, so none of these were good cases. Mrs.Hullett had died an unnatural death, of a barbiturate overdose, but there was no evidence or admission that Adams had persuaded her to take that overdose and, had Mrs.Hullett&#x27;s case been brought to trial after Adams&#x27;s first acquittal, Devlin believed that a second acquittal was virtually certain. In these five cases, Adams may have contributed to the deaths in some way, but this would not have been sufficient for a capital murder conviction.

===Committal hearing===

The committal hearing opened in Lewes on 14 January 1957. In accordance with the legal rule applying in 1957, Adams was charged on the single count of murdering Mrs.Morrell, but the prosecution also alleged he had killed Mr. and Mrs.Hullett in a similar fashion, and introduced evidence relating to them as evidence of system, which the prosecution also wished to refer to in the Morrell trial. Despite the objections of the defence that this evidence was inadmissible, the magistrates allowed it but, in cross-examination, the defence forced an admission from the Crown&#x27;s expert witness that Mr Hullett died of a coronary thrombosis. The hearing concluded on 24 January when, after a five-minute deliberation, Adams was committed for trial on the Morrell charge.

Melford Stevenson, who led the Crown&#x27;s case at this hearing, made an explicit claim that Adams&#x27;s instructions to especially clear Mrs.Hullett&#x27;s cheque two days before her death showed that he knew she was to die very soon, using her wealth and foreseen death as evidence of critical similarities to the deaths of Mr.Morrell and Mrs.Hullett. He also made an implication, unsupported by evidence, that Adams had been involved in the administration of the drugs that caused her death. Devlin considered the police case that there were similarities in the deaths of Mrs.Morrell and Mrs.Hullett was not well founded, as the claimed similarities were not distinctive. Had the police found two recent cases similar to Mrs.Hullett&#x27;s, where a patient had died of an overdose of pills prescribed by Adams, that might have shown the system, but the police found no such cases.

The Chairman of the magistrates was Sir Roland Gwynne, but he stepped down because of his close friendship with Adams. An exhibit that supported Melford Stevenson&#x27;s evidence, the cheque written out for £1,000, went missing after the hearing, instigating a further police investigation. While the culprit was not found, Scotland Yard suspected the local Deputy Chief Constable of Eastbourne, Seekings, of having misplaced it to help Adams. Seekings was known to have taken holidays with Adams and Gwynne and looked after Gwynne&#x27;s finances while he was in hospital in January 1957.

Following the committal hearing, the Attorney-General advised Devlin that he would not be using the evidence regarding the Hullets in the Morrell trial, but seeking a second indictment relating to Mrs.Hullett, which he did on 5 March 1957. Had this been proceeded with, a second committal hearing would have been required. The trial on the indictment relating to Mrs.Morrell started on 18 March 1957 at the Old Bailey, with that relating to Mrs.Hullett held back for a possible second separate trial. Three days later, a new Homicide Act came into effect; a single murder by poison became a non-capital offence. Adams, having been indicted on both charges before this date, would still face the death penalty if convicted. The Home Secretary would be less likely to grant clemency in the case of a second murder conviction in the Hullett case, as this would make it far more difficult politically to sentence Adams to life imprisonment, particularly as a double murder could still be capital under the 1957 Homicide Act, and Devlin considered that the Attorney-General&#x27;s aim in bringing forward a second indictment was to make it more likely that Adams would hang.

==Trial==

Adams was first tried for the murder of Morrell, with the Hullett charge to be prosecuted afterwards. The trial lasted 17 days, the longest murder trial in Britain up to that point. It was presided over by Mr. Justice Sir Patrick Devlin. Devlin summed up the tricky nature of the case thus: &quot;It is a most curious situation, perhaps unique in these courts, that the act of murder has to be proved by expert evidence.&quot;

Hannam was apparently shocked by the choice to try Adams for the murder of Morrell first. Morrell had been dead for a few years, her body had been cremated, and she was 81 at the time of her death. The much more recent death of Hullett, who died aged 50 without suffering from any somatic illness and whose body had not been cremated (and contained twice the fatal dose of barbiturates) would have made a much more convincing case.

The prosecution relied on three main bases: the amounts of opiate drugs prescribed by Adams for Mrs.Morrell, Adams&#x27;s verbal admission that he himself had injected almost all the amounts prescribed and statements taken from Mrs.Morrell&#x27;s nurses in August and November 1956. The statements of nurses Stronach and Randall suggested that Adams had increased the frequency of injections and the amount of each injection throughout the period they had nursed Mrs.Morrell, and that many of the injections Adams gave were of drugs taken from his bag, which he had prepared himself rather than asking the nurses to prepare, and they were unaware of the contents of these injections. These two nurses repeated these allegations when questioned by Manningham-Buller, but under cross-examination, they were forced to admit that it was they and the other two nurses that usually made up the injections to be administered either by them or Adams and that they had recorded the relatively few injections already prepared by Adams and had also recorded their nature on at least some occasions. Another nurse recalled that these were said to be vitamin injections, and it was also clear that the amounts of opiates injected were constant until September 1950, when another doctor first increased the dosage.

The leading Defence counsel Sir Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence, QC, had been briefed by the Medical Defence Union with the additional task of obtaining a ruling on whether medical treatments that might shorten the life of a terminally ill patient were legal. Lawrence, a &quot;specialist in real estate and divorce cases [and] a relative stranger in criminal court&quot;, who was defending his first murder trial, convinced the jury that there was no evidence that a murder had been committed, much less that a murder had been committed by Adams. He emphasised that the indictment was based mainly on testimonies from the nurses who tended to Mrs.Morrell and that there were discrepancies between the evidence given by different witnesses. Then, on the second day of the trial, he produced notebooks written by the nurses, detailing Adams&#x27;s treatment of Morrell. The prosecution claimed not to have seen these notebooks: these differed from the nurses&#x27; recollection of events and showed that smaller quantities of drugs were given to the patient than the prosecution had thought, based on Adams&#x27;s prescriptions.

Furthermore, the prosecution&#x27;s two expert medical witnesses gave differing opinions: Arthur Douthwaite was prepared to say that murder had definitely been committed (though he changed his mind in the middle of his testimony regarding the exact date), but Michael Ashby was more reticent. The defence witness and physician John Harman was adamant that Adams&#x27;s treatment, though unusual, was not reckless. Finally, the prosecution was wrong-footed by the defence not calling Adams to give evidence, thereby avoiding him &quot;chatting himself to the gallows&quot;. This was unexpected, shocking the prosecution, causing a commotion among the press and even surprising the judge. Devlin commented that the defence must have known this would cause prejudice against Adams, but the danger that Adams would be loquacious, or not able to keep to the point, would likely aid the prosecution. In addition, anything he might say could, if he were convicted, be used in a subsequent prosecution of the Hullett case.

Towards the end of his closing speech for the defence, Lawrence put the case for Adams&#x27;s innocence and the faulty basis of the prosecution case, saying:
Trying to ease the last hours of the dying is a doctor&#x27;s duty and it had been twisted and turned into an accusation for murder.

Mr. Justice Devlin received a phone call from Lord Goddard, the Lord Chief Justice, at the time defence and prosecution were making their closing speeches. In the event of Adams being acquitted, Lord Goddard suggested that Devlin might consider an application to release Adams on bail before the Hullett trial, which was due to start afterwards. Devlin was at first surprised since a person accused of murder had never been given bail before in British legal history, but was willing to entertain the idea and, on consideration, saw its merit as showing strong judicial displeasure over the Attorney-General&#x27;s plan to proceed with the second indictment. Goddard, as Lord Chief Justice, had responsibility for the conduct of all courts in England and Wales, from magistrates&#x27; courts to the Court of Appeal and was entitled to give Devlin his views on the case.

On 9 April 1957, the jury returned after 44 minutes to find Adams not guilty.

===Use of the &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;===

After the not-guilty verdict on the count of murdering Morrell, the normal process would have been to bring the indictment regarding Mrs Hullett to trial—either a full trial or, in view of the acquittal in Mrs Morrell&#x27;s case, a speedy one—so that Adams would plead not guilty. After such a plea, the Attorney-General would offer no evidence and the judge would direct the jury to bring in a not guilty verdict, which was the course Devlin expected. However the Attorney-General, as a minister of the Crown, had the power to suspend an indictment through a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;, something which Devlin said had never been used to prevent an accused from an acquittal, suggesting this was done because Manningham-Buller did not want a second acquittal and adverse verdicts in both the cases he had indicted. &quot;Nolle prosequi&quot; could legitimately be used in cases to protect a guilty person granted immunity to turn Queen&#x27;s evidence or to save the lives of the innocent, or sometimes on compassionate grounds.

Devlin later referred to the Manningham-Buller action as &quot;an abuse of process&quot;, saying: &quot;The use of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; to conceal the deficiencies of the prosecution was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that there might have been something in the talk of mass murder after all&quot;.

Manningham-Buller later told Parliament after the Morrell trial that the publicity which attended the Morrell trial would make it difficult to secure a fair trial on the indictment relating to Mrs Hullett, and that the second case depended very greatly on inference, which was not supported by admissions, as in Mrs Morrell&#x27;s case. This was a reference to Adams&#x27;s admission that he had himself administered most of Mrs Morrell&#x27;s opiate injections, whereas he had only said in his statements to the police that he had handed two barbiturate tablets to Mrs Hullett each day, and said nothing to link the total of barbiturates supplied to prescriptions he had issued.

==Claims of prejudice and political interference in the trial==

Cullen claimed that there was considerable evidence to suggest that the trial was &quot;interfered with&quot; by those &quot;at the highest level&quot;, although the available evidence amounts at best to suspicion. For example, during the committal hearing for Adams in January 1957, Lord Goddard, the Lord Chief Justice, was seen dining with Sir Roland Gwynne (Mayor of Eastbourne from 1929 to 1931) and the chairman of the local panel of magistrates, and ex-Attorney General Sir Hartley Shawcross, a member of the opposition, at a hotel in Lewes. As Lord Chief Justice, Goddard had responsibility for the conduct of all courts in England and Wales, from magistrates&#x27; courts to the Court of Appeal and the subject of their conversation is unreported and unknown.

The reasons for this supposed interference alleged by Cullen include concerns of the effect on the medical profession of a doctor being sentenced to death for prescribing certain medication in the course of treating patients at a time when doctors were already disaffected with the NHS. The case was &quot;very important for the medical profession&quot;, as the Attorney-General, a government minister, had created the threat of a death sentence by indicting Adams for two murders, an unusual practice in 1957. Other reasons suggested, with no direct relationship to the medical profession, were the Suez Crisis, which caused Anthony Eden to resign in January 1957, to be replaced by Harold Macmillan&#x27;s initially insecure government, and links to Harold Macmillan personally, through the death on 26 November 1950, over six years before the trial, of The 10th Duke of Devonshire, Harold Macmillan&#x27;s brother-in-law, who had been treated by Adams at the time of his death. Cullen&#x27;s supposition that the Attorney-General deliberately sabotaged a trial, which the available evidence showed he wanted to win, to please his political masters, or that Macmillan&#x27;s family affairs had any bearing on the trial, are dismissed by a later researcher as &quot;ludicrous&quot; and completely unsupported by credible evidence.

There is also considerable evidence of negative and prejudicial press coverage of the case. From the start of the Eastbourne Police investigation, in addition to rumours picked up from local residents, journalists had been briefed by the local Chief Constable about the suspicious nature of Mrs.Hullett&#x27;s death and possible links with other deaths. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in particular went so far as to link Bodkin Adams with what had become a murder investigation by stating that the police had interviewed him, and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; added that four other cases of Adams&#x27;s were being investigated in connection with the Hullett&#x27;s enquiry. Once the case had been passed to the Metropolitan Police, Percy Hoskins, who had resisted the general press condemnation of Adams, was contacted by an Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police on the basis that what had emerged from the Eastbourne investigation did not warrant the apparently concerted press campaign. Hoskins later exposed a police campaign to plant stories prejudicial to Adams in national newspapers, particularly the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, whose reporter was briefed by Hannam personally. Hannam was asked by his police superiors in October 1956 to do what he could to deal with the gossip that had arisen and, at the time of Adams&#x27;s arrest on 19 December 1956 (and aware of his superiors&#x27; criticisms of his relationship with the press), he attempted to distance himself from their activities.

==Discovery of the nurses&#x27; notebooks==

On the second day of the trial, the defence introduced eight notebooks of the daily records made by nurses who had attended Mrs.Morrell under Adams&#x27;s directions. These were not available to the prosecution when the trial started so Manningham-Buller had no chance to consider their contents before the defence began to use them in the cross-examination of the first nurse appearing for the prosecution. He was, however, presented with a copy of them by the defence later in the second day of the trial. These books were then used by the defence to counter the witness statements and evidence in chief given by the nurses who had originally written the notes. Comments in the nurses&#x27; witness statements which were prejudicial to Adams were disproved by reference to their contemporaneous notes. Six years after the event, the notes could be said to be more reliable than the nurses&#x27; own memories. However, Devlin noted the witness statements that supported Hannam&#x27;s theories were taken by Hannam and his team, and that doing this accurately may have been beyond Hannam&#x27;s powers.

The defence was not required to explain how the books came into their hands, and the Attorney-General neither made any effort to pursue this matter nor asked for an adjournment to acquaint himself with the new evidence, although Devlin later said that he would have been willing to grant it, had Manningham-Buller requested one. His reticence was perplexing since the Attorney-General was known for his doggedness. As Lord Devlin later said of him: &quot;He could be downright rude but he did not shout or bluster. Yet his disagreeableness was so pervasive, his persistence so interminable, the obstructions he manned so far-flung, his objectives apparently so insignificant, that sooner or later you would be tempted to ask yourself whether the game was worth the candle. And if you asked yourself that, you were finished.&quot; Manningham-Buller did, however, claim in his closing speech that Adams may have influenced or corrupted the nurses to ensure they had not made entries that might incriminate him, an issue that Devlin noted had not been suggested to any of the nurses when they gave evidence.

Author Jane Robins was allowed access both to the archives of Herbert James, the friend and solicitor of Adams, and to Lord Devlin&#x27;s private papers on the trial, which included Devlin&#x27;s observation that James had found the notebooks after the police office that had conducted the search had failed to notice them. Herbert James&#x27; archives showed that he had found the nurses&#x27; notebooks in Adams&#x27;s surgery on 24 November 1956, after the Eastbourne police had visited the surgery and carried out a search, after which they had taken Adams to Eastbourne police station for questioning. James&#x27; intention was to carry out his own search for anything that might either help or incriminate Adams and which had been missed by the police, and he found the notebooks.

Devlin criticised Hannam and his team for overlooking the nurses&#x27; notebooks, in a passage that confirms that he was aware of how the notebooks were found, adding that Adams had said his records for Mrs.Morrell were filed under &quot;M&quot; in his filing cabinet, but they had been moved later so that the police did not find them, whereas a more thorough search did. Cullen states that the notebooks were recorded in pre-trial police records but were not in the hands of the prosecution when the trial started, adding that Adams had given three conflicting explanations for how he came to have the notebooks in 1950, although he certainly had them in 1956. The first explanation was that they were given to him by Mrs.Morrell&#x27;s son, who had found them among her effects, and Adams then filed them away at his surgery; next that they were delivered anonymously to his door after she died; or, finally, they were found in the air raid shelter at the back of his garden. Cullen noted that a claim that the notebooks were overlooked in the police search on 24 November 1956 but found by the defence team in Adams&#x27;s surgery on the same evening was inconsistent with the list of exhibits for the Committal Hearing given by the police to the DPP&#x27;s office, which mentioned the notebooks. She suggests that the Attorney General must therefore have known they existed, and, according to her, that this showed &quot;that there was a will at the highest of levels to undermine the case against Dr. Adams.&quot; However, Devlin mentions that it was the responsibility of suitably qualified solicitors and barristers in the Director&#x27;s office to prepare the brief from the police report, not the personal responsibility of the Attorney General, so basing such a serious claim of interference on discounting the only available account of their finding and a misunderstanding of the prosecution process shows its weakness.

==Suspicious cases==

At an early stage in the investigation, Hannam believed he had found Adams&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot;: that he first made his victims drug addicts, then influenced them to change their wills in his favour and finally gave them a lethal dose of opiates. He concentrated on those cases where Adams had been left legacies or given gifts or had apparently stolen items from the deceased, even when the medical evidence was doubtful. Hannam confided to a reporter at this time that he was convinced that Adams was a serial killer who had killed fourteen people. Between August and October 1956, Hannam collected a significant number of witness statements, mainly from relatives of Adams&#x27;s deceased former patients who claimed that these had been heavily drugged by Adams, were injected with unknown substances and had become comatose or unresponsive.

By mid-October 1956, Hannam had drafted his initial report for his Chief Superintendent. His interim report on his investigation of October 1956 includes his strong suspicions both of narcotic poisoning in several cases and of Adams inducing patients to make or change their wills in his favour. What Hannam considered were a significant number of suspiciously sinister events were bolstered, in his report by statements made by Adams about Mrs.Hullett&#x27;s death that Hannam regarded as incriminating. Hannam&#x27;s Chief Superintendent was initially dismissive of the case he had presented, considering it was speculative, based on rumour and could not be proved; the Commander of &#x27;C&#x27; Division agreed, and the Director of Public Prosecutions asked Hannam to obtain more evidence. In January 1957, Hannam obtained further statements from Nurse Stronach and Nurse Randal, later prosecution witnesses in the Morrell case, which were more specific and more damaging to Adams. The nurses claimed in particular that they were generally unaware of what he was injecting. The statements gathered both before and after Hannam&#x27;s initial report have often been quoted in support of Adams&#x27;s guilt, but in the Morrell case, the nurses&#x27; own notebooks showed that the testimony in their statements was at best misremembered, at worst untrue.

The police focused on cases after 1946, and statements were taken under oath in only four cases (Mrs.Morrell, Mr. and Mrs.Hullet, and one dealing solely with offences relating to prescriptions, cremation forms, and dangerous drugs register). In other cases, Hannam had taken verbal statements, although Devlin doubted his ability to take statements that could be used in evidence without revision.

===Principal cases===

Cullen mentions Mrs.Morrell, Mr. and Mrs.Hullett, Clara Neil Miller and Julia Bradnum as cases that Hannam regarded as warranting prosecution. Details about Mrs.Morrell and Mrs.Hullett are given above: the case of Mr.Hullett and the two cases where police suspicions led to exhumations indicate that there was insufficient evidence of the cause of death to warrant a prosecution.

* 11 May 1952 – Julia Bradnum died aged 85. The previous year Adams asked her if her will was in order and offered to accompany her to the bank to check it. On examining it, he pointed out that she had not stated her beneficiaries&#x27; addresses and that it should be rewritten. She had wanted to leave her house to her adopted daughter but Adams suggested it would be better to sell the house and then give money to whomever she wanted. This she did. Adams eventually received £661. While Adams attended to this patient, he was often seen holding her hand and chatting to her on one knee.
** The day before Bradnum died, she had been doing housework and going for walks. The next morning she woke up feeling unwell. Adams was called and saw her. He gave her an injection and stated &quot;It will be over in three minutes&quot;. It was. Adams then confirmed &quot;I&#x27;m afraid she&#x27;s gone&quot; and left the room.
** Bradnum was exhumed on 21 December 1956. Adams had said on the death certificate that Bradnum died of a cerebral haemorrhage, but Francis Camps examined her remains and was unable to find evidence either to prove or disprove this, stating that, because of the advanced degree of decomposition of the corpse, the brain was not in a condition to be assessed. Had the final injection given to Mrs.Bradnum been morphine, heroin or barbiturates, this might have been apparent from the liver, but Camps did not order toxicology tests, considering he could not be sure of the state of the internal organs what comprised the remains of the liver. 
* 22 February 1954 – Clara Neil Miller, died aged 87. Adams often locked the door when he saw her – for up to twenty minutes at a time. A witness, Dolly Wallis, asked Clara about this, and she said he was assisting her in &quot;personal matters&quot;: pinning on brooches, adjusting her dress. His fat hands were &quot;comforting&quot; to her. Wallis also claimed that Clara appeared to be under the influence of drugs.
** Early that February, the coldest for many years, Adams had sat with her in her room for forty minutes. A nurse entered, unnoticed, and saw Clara&#x27;s &quot;bed clothes all off... and over the foot rail of the bed, her night gown up around her chest and the window in the room open top and bottom&quot;, while Adams read to her from the Bible. When later confronted by Hannam regarding this, Adams said &quot;The person who told you that doesn&#x27;t know why I did it&quot;.
** Clara left Adams £1,275, and he charged her estate a further £700 after her death in addition to a £500 cheque he got from her earlier. He was the sole executor. Her funeral was arranged by Adams and only he and Annie Sharpe, the owner of the guest house, were present. Annie Sharpe received £200 in Clara&#x27;s will. Adams tipped the vicar a guinea after the ceremony. Clara Neil Miller was one of the two bodies exhumed during the police investigation on 21 December 1956. Despite the poor condition of the corpse, Francis Camps found evidence of coronary thrombosis and bronchopneumonia. Small amounts of morphine and barbiturates were also found, but not in sufficient quantities to draw any conclusions. According to prescription records, Adams had not prescribed anything to treat the bronchopneumonia.
* 14 March 1956 – Alfred John Hullett died, aged 71. He was the husband of Gertrude Hullett. Sometime in the 1940s, Adams falsely told Alfred Hullett that he (Hullett) needed an urgent operation; Hullett consulted another doctor and Adams&#x27;s claim was revealed to be absolutely wrong. Still, Adams remained Hullett&#x27;s friend. In November 1955, Adams diagnosed Hullett with cancer in his abdomen (the same diagnosis as Annie Sharpe). A doctor called in from London attempted an operation during which &quot;something went wrong&quot;. Ten days later, Alfred&#x27;s &quot;whole abdomen burst&quot;; Adams, and his partner in practice, operated immediately and &quot;repaired the burst&quot; (in Adams&#x27;s words). Since then, Adams was giving Hullett large doses of morphine. &quot;I am too full of dope to say anything sensible&quot;, Hullett said to one of his friends. Hullett started exhibiting heart problems, and in March 1956, a heart specialist opined that Hullett had been suffering from &quot;some type of heart trouble&quot; since childhood and that the condition was now worsening. The specialist expected that Hullett would die within a few months and might die at any time; on 13 March, he had severe chest pains consistent with a heart attack. He died the next morning of what Adams described as cerebral haemorrhage.
** Shortly after his death, Adams went to a chemist&#x27;s to get a 10 cc hypodermic morphine solution containing 5 grains in Mr. Hullett&#x27;s name, and for the prescription to be back-dated to the previous day. The police presumed this was to cover morphine Adams had given him from his own private supplies. Mr. Hullett left Adams £500 in his will. In cross-examination during Adams&#x27;s committal hearing, the defence forced an admission from the Crown&#x27;s expert witness that Mr. Hullett died of a coronary thrombosis.

===Death of Annie Sharpe===

Annie Sharpe was the proprietor of &#x27;Barton&#x27;, a boarding house where at least two of Adams&#x27;s victims, the Neil Miller sisters (Hilda, died 1953; and Clara, died 1954) had lived; Adams had cut both of them off from their relatives and prevented them from receiving their mail. Sharpe herself tried to get the Neil Miller sisters to &quot;invest £5,000 in her business&quot;; she admitted only to receiving a £200 cheque from Clara Neil Miller. She and Adams were the only people present during Clara Neil Miller&#x27;s burial.

After interviewing Sharpe, Hannam considered her a key witness and thought she was the key to the whole matter, suspecting she was money-grabbing and in collusion with Adams.

While the investigation was underway, Sharpe was suddenly &quot;diagnosed&quot; by Adams with cancer in her abdominal cavity and died a few days after this diagnosis, on 13 or 15 November 1956. Her body was cremated.

==After the acquittal==

In the aftermath of the trial, Adams resigned from the National Health Service and was convicted in Lewes Crown Court on 26 July 1957, on eight counts of forging prescriptions, four counts of making false statements on cremation forms, and three offences under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951, and fined £2,400 plus costs of £457. His licence to prescribe dangerous drugs was revoked on 4 September and on 27 November he was struck off the Medical Register by the GMC. Adams continued to see some of his more loyal patients, and prescribed over-the-counter medicine to them.

Immediately following the trial, Percy Hoskins, the chief crime reporter for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, whisked Adams off to a safe house in Westgate-on-Sea near Margate in Kent, where Adams spent the next two weeks recounting his life story. Hoskins had befriended Adams during the trial and was the only major journalist to act on the presumption of his innocence. Adams was paid £10,000 (£ today) for the interview, though he never spent the proceeds. The notes were found untouched in a bank vault after his death. Adams then successfully sued several newspapers for libel. Adams returned to Eastbourne, where he continued to practise privately, despite the widespread belief in the town that he had murdered people. That belief was not shared by his friends and his patients in general. One exception was Sir Roland Gwynne, who distanced himself from Adams after the trial.

After two failed applications, Adams was reinstated as a general practitioner on 22 November 1961, and his authority to prescribe dangerous drugs was restored the following July. He continued to practise as a sole practitioner, not resuming his partnership with the town&#x27;s &quot;Red House&quot; practice. In August 1962, Adams applied for a visa to the United States but was refused because of his dangerous drug convictions.

Adams later became president (and honorary medical officer) of the British Clay Pigeon Shooting Association.

Sir Roland Gwynne died on 15 November 1971. Adams signed his death certificate.

==Death==
Adams slipped and fractured his hip on 30 June 1983 while shooting in Battle, East Sussex. He was taken to Eastbourne Hospital but developed a chest infection and died on 4 July of left ventricular failure. He left an estate of £402,970 (£800 million in 2025 money) and bequeathed £1,000 to Percy Hoskins.

==Historical views on Adams==

===Before 2003===

Opinion regarding Adams has been divided, though in recent years has tended to the view that he was a murderer. The writer Sybille Bedford, present at Adams&#x27;s trial, was adamant that he was not guilty. Many publications were sued for libel during Adams&#x27;s lifetime, showing the prevalence of the rumours that surrounded him.

After Adams&#x27;s death, writers were more free to speculate. In 1983, Rodney Hallworth and Mark Williams concluded Adams was a serial killer and probably schizophrenic: &quot;In the opinion of many experts Adams died an unconvicted mass-murderer&quot;. Percy Hoskins, writing in 1984, was of the opposite opinion, adamant that Adams was not guilty but merely &quot;naive&quot; and &quot;avaricious&quot;. In 1985, Sir Patrick Devlin, the judge, stated that Adams may have been a &quot;mercenary mercy killer&quot; but, though compassionate, he was at the same time greedy and &quot;prepared to sell death&quot;: &quot;He did not think of himself as a murderer but a dispenser of death [...] According to his lights, he had done nothing wrong. There was nothing wrong in a doctor getting a legacy, nor in his bestowing in return [...] a death as happy as heroin could make it.&quot; He also &quot;could be convinced that Dr. Adams had helped to end Mrs.Hullett&#x27;s life&quot;. In 2000, Surtees, a former colleague of Adams, wrote a more sympathetic account of him as being the victim of a police vendetta.

In 1986, &quot;The Good Doctor Bodkin Adams&quot;, a television docudrama based on his trial, was produced with Timothy West in the lead.

===After 2003===

These writers, other than Devlin, who read and based his account on the papers from the committal proceedings and the case papers for the Hullett case before it was discontinued, based their opinions almost entirely on the evidence given in court regarding Morrell. The police archives were opened in 2003 at the request of Pamela Cullen, who speculates that Adams was acquitted more due to the way the case &quot;was presented than [to] Doctor Adams&#x27; lack of guilt&quot;. She also highlights the fact that Hannam&#x27;s investigation was &quot;blinkered&quot; from the perspective of motive: Hannam assumed monetary gain was the driving force because during the 1950s, little was known of what really motivated serial killers, i.e. &quot;physical needs, emotions and often bizarre interpretations of reality&quot;.

The apparently incompatible accounts of Adams as a barely competent doctor lavish in his use of heroin and morphia with his successful and lucrative medical practice may be explained by the medical profession&#x27;s attitude to end-of-life care in the period. Between the 1930s and 1960s, the medical profession, in general, regarded death as a failure and subjected dying patients to treatments aimed at prolonging life rather than relieving suffering, an attitude prevalent in the post-war National Health Service, which failed to make adequate provision for the dying. Increasingly, patients feared suffering before death and, although a few doctors were prepared to advocate the use of opiates in palliative care openly, published medical commentary on care of the dying was rare before the 1960s. However, a 1948 article observed that &quot;purely medical treatment&quot; for the dying could &quot;almost be written in one word—morphine&quot;, and a 1957 British Medical Association meeting heard the use of heroin to induce euphoria, oblivion, and relieve pain. Although doctors were aware that hastening a patient&#x27;s death was illegal, one suggested in 1944 it was something &quot;the law forbids in theory but ignores in practice&quot;: he added it was something only the doctor could judge, and it should not be discussed with patients, their families, or medical colleagues.

In Adams&#x27;s case, the court did not ignore the suggestion that he had hastened death. As Devlin makes clear, he needed to clarify for the jury, and incidentally the medical profession, the extent to which the law allowed the orthodox doctor to go in easing the passing of the dying. Mahar regards Adam&#x27;s statements to Hannam on Mrs.Morrell as less about his guilt or innocence than a disconnection between the medical and legal views on assisted dying: Adams never denied giving his patients large doses of opiates, but denied it was murder. This was not simply Adams&#x27;s idiosyncratic view, as appears from the evidence of Dr. Douthwaite for the prosecution, who accepted that a physician might knowingly give fatal doses of pain-relieving drugs to terminally ill patients, adding it was not his business to say whether it was murder. Devlin&#x27;s directions to the jury confirmed that it was a medical issue, not a legal or moral one, whether Adams&#x27;s treatment was designed to promote comfort. Devlin&#x27;s view was that Adams may have been guilty of mercy killing or even perhaps finishing off a troublesome patient, but was one who cared for his patients to the best of his ability. Adams eased the passing of MrsMorrell, but his greed brought his motives into question. Mahar notes that an editorial in a medical journal following the case suggested that the publicity it caused might hamper medical discretion, but claimed the use of opiates in terminal cases was essential. Adams may be seen as an extreme case in their use, but other doctors also used them to ease the passing.

==Legal legacy==

Adams&#x27;s trial has had many effects on the English legal system.
*The first was establishing the principle of double effect that if a doctor &quot;gave treatment to a seriously ill patient with the aim of relieving pain or distress, as a result of which that person&#x27;s life was inadvertently shortened, the doctor was not guilty of murder.&quot;
*Owing to the potentially prejudicial evidence that was mentioned in the committal hearing (regarding Mrs Hullett, evidence that was not subsequently used in Adams&#x27;s trial for murdering Mrs Morrell), the Tucker Committee was held, which led to the law being changed in the subsequent Criminal Justice Act 1967 to restrict what might be published about committal hearings to avoid pre-trial publicity.
* Though a defendant had never been required to give evidence in his defence, Mr Justice Devlin underlined in his summing-up that no prejudice should be attached by the jury to Adams not doing so.
* The case also led to changes in Dangerous Drugs Regulations, meaning that Schedule IV poisons required a signed and dated record of patient details and the total dose used. Previously, the record need only have recorded such drugs obtained.

It has been suggested by a number of professionals in biomedical law that Devlin&#x27;s proposition that a doctor whose primary intention is to relieve pain, even if life is incidentally shortened, provides a special defence in law for doctors only, and may be an example of the reluctance of courts to convict doctors. Although it is frequently asserted by, for example, the British Medical Association, that UK law does not distinguish between doctors and non-doctors, the way that intention to kill is interpreted in medical cases shows that the law treats the &quot;bona fide&quot; exercise of a doctor&#x27;s clinical judgment as precluding a guilty mind.

===Subsequent cases===

It was 25 years before another doctor in Britain, Leonard Arthur, stood trial for murder arising from treatment. Arthur was tried in November 1981 at Leicester Crown Court for the attempted murder of John Pearson, a newborn child with Down syndrome. Like Adams, on the advice of his legal team, he did not give evidence in his defence, relying instead on expert witnesses. He was acquitted.

More recently, the double effect principle figured in two British murder trials. In 1990, Nigel Leigh Cox, a rheumatologist, was convicted of the attempted murder of a terminally ill patient who had begged him to kill her. Once painkillers had proved ineffective, he injected her with twice the lethal dose of potassium chloride and she died within minutes. Cox&#x27;s claim that his intention was to relieve suffering was not accepted, as potassium chloride had no analgesic properties. In the same year, Thomas Lodwig gave a terminal cancer patient an injection of lignocaine and potassium chloride which proved rapidly fatal. However, as lignocaine is a pain-killer, his claim that potassium chloride could accelerate the analgesic effect of recognised painkillers was not disputed by the prosecution. Although Lodwig was charged with murder, the prosecution offered no evidence at his trial.

In 2000, Harold Shipman became the only British doctor to be successfully prosecuted for the murder of his patients. He was found guilty on 15 counts and the Shipman Inquiry concluded in 2002 that he had probably murdered as many as 250 people.

<text>Octav Onicescu (; August 20, 1892 – August 19, 1983) was a Romanian mathematician and a member of the Romanian Academy. Together with his student, Gheorghe Mihoc, he is considered to be the founder of the Romanian school of probability theory and statistics.

==Biography==
He was born in Botoșani, the son of Vlad Onicescu, from Ștefănești, Botoșani County, and Ana, from Oniceni, Neamț County. He graduated from the Botoșani A. T. Laurian High School in 1911 with a perfect average grade of 10. That same year, he entered the University of Bucharest, from where he graduated with degrees in mathematics and philosophy in 1913. From 1914 to 1916 he was a mathematics teacher at the military gymnasium of Dealu Monastery, near Târgoviște. From 1916 to 1918 he fought in World War I.

In 1919, Onicescu went to study geometry at the University of Rome, under the guidance of Tullio Levi-Civita. He earned his PhD in June, 1920 for a thesis titled &quot;Sopra gli spazi einsteiniani a gruppi continui di transformazione&quot; (&quot;On Einstein manifolds and groups of continuous transformations&quot;). The thesis, which dealt with problems in differential geometry related to Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, was defended in front of a jury of 11 mathematicians, including Levi-Civita, Vito Volterra, and Guido Castelnuovo.

In the fall of 1920 he went to Paris, where he gave talks in Jacques Hadamard&#x27;s seminar at the Collège de France. While in Paris, he organized a seminar with other Romanian mathematicians, including Petre Sergescu, Șerban Gheorghiu, Alexandru Pantazi, and Șerban Coculescu.

In 1922, he returned to Bucharest, where he embarked on a 40-year-long university career. In 1924, he started teaching the first college-level probability theory course in Romania. From 1928 on, he was professor at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Bucharest, and was appointed full professor in 1931. In 1930, he organized the School of Statistics and established an Institute of Calculus, serving as its director for many years. In 1936 he entered the Legionary Movement. The Romanian poet and mathematician Ion Barbu (Dan Barbilian) was a close friend of his.

Onicescu was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1928 at Bologna and in 1936 at Oslo. He was elected corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1933, and became titular member on February 4, 1965. He was in charge of the Probability Theory section of the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy.

He died in Bucharest on the eve of his 91st birthday, after a short illness.

==Legacy==
Onicescu was one of the founders of the Balkan Union of Mathematicians (in 1934) and of the International Centre for Mechanical Sciences in Udine (in 1968).

The &quot;Octav Onicescu&quot; museum, founded in Botoșani in October 1995, houses furniture and memorabilia that belonged to him, including manuscripts, letters, diplomas, books, photographs, and military decorations. The memorial house doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.

Oniscescu defined and studied the information energy and correlation coefficient in information theory.

<text>Francis Edward Camps (28 June 1905 – 8 July 1972) was an English pathologist notable for his work on the cases of serial killer John Christie and suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams.

==Early life and training==
Camps was born in Teddington, Middlesex, the son of Percy William Leopold Camps (1878–1956), a general practitioner and surgeon. Camps was educated at Marlborough College, followed by a medical degree at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. He went on to postgraduate studies at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Neuchâtel University, Switzerland.

==Career==
In 1935, Camps decided to specialise in pathology, and took up the post of pathologist at the Chelmsford and Essex Hospital. He was professor of Forensic Medicine at the London Hospital Medical College since 1963 (Reader 1954–63). President of the International Association of Forensic Scientists, 1963–66. Honorary Consultant to the Army in Forensic Medicine after 1964. He was a Past-President of the British Association and Secretary General, British Academy of Forensic Sciences. Professor Camps was the author of many papers on forensic medicine, and of &quot;Practical Forensic Medicine&quot;.

==Medico-legal work==
He worked on, amongst others, the John Bodkin Adams case in 1956 where he identified 163 suspicious deaths and was an expert witness in the trial the following year. However, Adams was acquitted of murdering one of his patients, owing to lack of evidence of motive, among other uncertainties.

==10 Rillington Place==

Camps gave evidence during the trial of John Christie in 1953, having produced a detailed and comprehensive report on the many bodies found at 10 Rillington Place. The bodies were well preserved and so much relevant information could be gleaned from their condition. His report showed a consistent pattern of attack by Christie, most of the intact victims having been sexually molested and strangled. Beryl and Geraldine Evans had alone been strangled, and their bodies were exhumed to be re-examined for Christie&#x27;s trial.

The skeletal remains of Christie&#x27;s older victims buried in the back garden at Rillington Place (a human thigh bone visibly propped up a small fence) provided less information, although it proved possible to identify the women involved. There could be little doubt that Christie had murdered them all, that Timothy Evans was innocent, and that he had been wrongly executed, although it took many years to establish the truth of the matter. The forensic and witness evidence pointed to a serious miscarriage of justice, although it was contested by a series of lawyers and politicians well after the events. 

However, several authors, such as Ludovic Kennedy, pointed out the many contradictions and errors in the Crown&#x27;s case, and the innocence of Evans is now widely accepted, both by public, experts and by the Crown itself. The case was the most prominent of a series of miscarriages which ultimately led to the abolition of capital punishment for murder in England, Wales and Scotland in 1965.

==Other cases==
He reported on numerous deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning, accounting for nearly half of all suicides in Britain in the 1950s when coal gas was widely available in many homes until in the 1960s it was progressively replaced by the less toxic natural gas: the suicide rate in Britain fell by almost a third and has not risen since. 

His analysis of the problem of identifying the gas in bodies after death was published posthumously in his autobiography, together with other of his cases such as the Rhyl mummy and the Colchester taxi cab murder. In the same book, he also examined the forensic evidence involving Jack the Ripper.

==Death==
Camps died in 1972 from a perforated gastric ulcer, for which he refused to have surgery performed.

== Tribute ==
The author Earl Stanley Gardner dedicated one of his novels, &quot;The Case of the Duplicate Daughter&quot;, to Camps in appreciation of his professional acumen. A short dedication note by the author can be found at the beginning of the novel.

<text>Charles Eugene Belknap (October 17, 1846 – January 16, 1929) was an American politician who served as a U.S. representative from the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Early life and education==
Belknap was born in Massena, New York and attended the common schools there. He moved with his family to Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1855.

==Civil War==
During the American Civil War, he enlisted as a private on August 12, 1862, in Company H of the Twenty-first Regiment, Michigan Volunteer Infantry. He was rapidly promoted through several ranks, including: 
* Fourth Sergeant, September 1, 1862
* First Sergeant, January 1, 1863
* Sergeant Major of the Regiment, February 1, 1863
* Second Lieutenant, April 1, 1863
* Brevet First Lieutenant, September 22, 1863, for gallant service at the Battle of Chickamauga, by special order of general Sheridan
* Brevet Captain, January 8, 1864, in recognition of services rendered at and near Chattanooga, Tennessee.

He served in the Army of the Cumberland during the Atlanta Campaign, and with General Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea and through the Carolinas Campaign. He was mustered out of service on June 8, 1865, and was breveted to the rank of major. At the battles of Stones River and Chickamauga he received seven wounds, none of them very serious. He later joined the Michigan Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Life after the war==
After the war, from the fall of 1865 to 1871, Belknap lived on a farm in Sparta, Michigan, before returning to Grand Rapids, where he organized the &quot;Belknap Wagon and Sleigh Company&quot;, a very successful business that manufactured wagons and sleighs.

Beginning in 1872, Belknap served in the city&#x27;s volunteer fire service for many years, as both foreman of Company No. 3 and as Assistant Chief. He was instrumental in the transition from a volunteer to a paid fire service. He was a member of the Grand Rapids board of education 1878–1885, served on the board of aldermen from the Seventh Ward 1880–1882, and was mayor in 1884. In 1885, he was appointed by Governor Russell A. Alger as a Trustee of the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb in Flint, Michigan for a term ending in 1891.

==Congressman==
Belknap defeated Melbourne H. Ford in 1888 to be elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 5th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives for the Fifty-first Congress. He served from March 4, 1889, to March 3, 1891. He was not a candidate for re-nomination to the Fifty-second Congress in 1890, but was subsequently elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Ford on April 20, 1891. Belknap served from November 3, 1891, to March 3, 1893. He unsuccessfully contested the election of George F. Richardson to the Fifty-third Congress. He performed staff duty at Fort Oglethorpe during the Spanish–American War.

==Death==
He died in Grand Rapids and is interred in the Greenwood Cemetery there.

<text>We Were Soldiers is a 2002 American war film written and directed by Randall Wallace and starring Mel Gibson. Based on the book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once… and Young&quot; (1992) by Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway, it dramatizes the Battle of Ia Drang on November 14, 1965.

==Plot==
In 1954, the French Army&#x27;s Group Mobile 100, on patrol during the First Indochina War, is ambushed by Viet Minh forces. Viet Minh commander Nguyen Huu An orders his soldiers to &quot;kill all they send, and they will stop coming&quot;.

Eleven years later in 1965, the United States is fighting the Vietnam War. US Army Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore is chosen to train and lead a battalion. After arriving in Vietnam, he learns that an American base has been attacked and is ordered to take his 400 men after the enemy and eliminate the North Vietnamese attackers; intelligence has no idea of the number of enemy troops. Moore leads a newly-created air cavalry unit into the Ia Drang Valley. After landing, the soldiers capture a North Vietnamese scout and learn from him that the location they were sent to is the base camp for a veteran North Vietnamese army division of 4,000 men.

Upon arrival in the area with a platoon of soldiers, 2nd Lt. Henry Herrick spots another enemy scout and runs after him, ordering his reluctant soldiers to follow. The scout lures them into an ambush, which results in several men being killed, including Herrick and his subordinates. The surviving platoon members are surrounded and cut off from the rest of the battalion. Sgt. Savage assumes command, calls in the artillery, and uses the cover of night to keep the Vietnamese from overrunning their defensive position.

Meanwhile, with helicopters constantly dropping off units, Moore manages to secure weak points before the North Vietnamese can take advantage of them. Despite being trapped and desperately outnumbered, the main US force manages to hold off the North Vietnamese with artillery, mortars, and helicopter airlifts of supplies and reinforcements. Eventually, Nguyen Huu An, the commander of the North Vietnamese division, orders a large-scale attack on the American position.

Back in the United States, Julia Moore has become the leader of the American wives who live on the base. When the Army begins using taxi drivers to deliver telegrams that notify the next of kin of the soldiers&#x27; deaths, Julia takes over that responsibility.

At the point of being overrun by the enemy, Moore orders 1st Lt. Charlie Hastings, his forward air controller, to call in &quot;&quot;, a call for all available combat aircraft to attack enemy positions, even those close to the US troops&#x27; position, because they are being overrun. The aircraft attacked with bombs, napalm, and machine guns, killing many People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam and Viet Cong troops, but a friendly fire incident also results in American deaths. The North Vietnamese attack is repelled, and the surviving soldiers of Herrick&#x27;s cut-off platoon, including Savage, are rescued.

Moore&#x27;s troops regroup and secure the area. Nguyen Huu An plans a final assault on the Americans and sends most of his forces to carry out the attack, but Moore and his men overrun them and approach the enemy command center. Before the base camp guards can open fire, Major Bruce &quot;Snake&quot; Crandall and other helicopter gunships attack and destroy the remnant of the enemy force. With no more troops to call on, Huu An quickly orders the headquarters evacuated.

Having achieved his objective, Moore returns to the helicopter landing zone to be picked up. Only after everyone (including the dead and wounded) is removed from the battlefield does he fly out of the valley. Sometime later, Nguyen Huu An and his men arrive on the battlefield to collect their dead. He claims that the Americans will &quot;think this was their victory. So this will become an American war&quot;.

At the end of the film, it is revealed that the landing zone immediately reverted to North Vietnamese hands after the American troops were airlifted out. Hal Moore continued the battle in a different landing zone, and after nearly a year, he returned home safely to Julia and his family. His superiors congratulate him for killing over 1,800 North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong soldiers. An older, now retired Moore visits the Vietnam War memorial and looks at the names of the soldiers who fell at Ia Drang.

==Cast==

==Adaptation from source material==
In the source book, &quot;We Were Soldiers Once… and Young&quot;, Hal Moore complains, &quot;Every damn Hollywood movie got [the Vietnam war] wrong.&quot; The director, Randall Wallace, said that he was inspired by that comment and became &quot;determined to get it right this time.&quot;

The film&#x27;s final version got many of the facts of the book presented onto film but is not entirely a historically accurate portrayal of the battle or entirely faithful to the book. For instance, the film depicts a heroic charge under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore at the end of the battle that destroys the Vietnamese reserve, ending the battle in an American victory (a fact that the director noted in his commentary). In fact, there was no heroic final charge in the book, and the North Vietnamese forces were not destroyed, although Moore did report 834 enemy bodies and 1215 estimated killed in action (one-third of the enemy force). The US forces were reduced by 72 out of 395, with 18% fatal casualties. The Vietnamese commander, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An, did not see the conclusion at Landing Zone X-Ray as the end of combat, and the battle continued the next day with combat action at Landing Zone Albany, where the 2/7th, with A Company 1/5th, found themselves in a fight for their lives against Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An&#x27;s reserve.

Despite the differences from the book and departures from historical accuracy, Moore stated in a documentary, included in the video versions, that the film was the first one &quot;to get [the war] right.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Roger Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; 3.5 stars out of 4, and praised its truthful and realistic battle scenes and how it follows the characters: &quot;&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; was criticized because the characters seemed hard to tell apart. &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; doesn&#x27;t have that problem; in the Hollywood tradition it identifies a few key players, casts them with stars, and follows their stories.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum, from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the film a B and noted its fair treatment of both sides: &quot;The writer-director bestows honor – generously, apolitically – not only on the dead and still living American veterans who fought in Ia Drang, but also on their families, on their Vietnamese adversaries, and on the families of their adversaries too. Rarely has a foe been portrayed with such measured respect for a separate reality, which should come as a relief to critics (I&#x27;m one) of the enemy&#x27;s facelessness in &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;; vignettes of gallantry among Vietnamese soldiers and such humanizing visual details as a Vietnamese sweetheart&#x27;s photograph left behind, in no way interfere with the primary, rousing saga of a fine American leader who kept his promise to his men to &#x27;leave no one behind dead or alive.&#x27;&quot;

David Sterritt, from the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, criticized the film for giving a more positive image of the Vietnam War that, in his opinion, did not concur with reality: &quot;The films about Vietnam that most Americans remember are positively soaked in physical and emotional torment – from &quot;Platoon&quot;, with its grunt&#x27;s-eye view of combat, to &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, with its exploration of war&#x27;s dehumanizing insanity. Today, the pendulum has swung back again. If filmmakers with politically twisted knives once sliced away guts-and-glory clichés, their current equivalents hack away all meaningful concern with moral and political questions. &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is shameless in this regard, filling the screen with square-jawed officers who weep at the carnage and fresh-faced GIs who use their last breaths to intone things like, &#x27;I&#x27;m glad I died for my country.&#x27;&quot;

Todd McCarthy, from &quot;Variety&quot;, wrote the film &quot;presents the fighting realistically, violently and relatively coherently given the chaotic circumstances...&quot; McCarthy further wrote, &quot;Mel Gibson has the closest thing to a John Wayne part that anyone&#x27;s played since the Duke himself rode into the sunset, and he plays it damn well.&quot; He summarized, &quot;Gibson&#x27;s performance anchors the film with commanding star power to burn. This officer truly loves his men, and the credibility with which the actor can express Moore&#x27;s leadership qualities, as well as his sensitive side, is genuinely impressive.&quot;

===Involved combatant&#x27;s response===
Hal Moore, who had long been critical of many Vietnam War films for their negative portrayals of American servicemen, publicly expressed approval of the film and is featured in segments of the DVD.

Retired Colonel Rick Rescorla, who played an important role in the book (and was pictured on the book&#x27;s cover), was disappointedafter reading the scriptto learn that he and his unit had been left out of the film. In one key incident, the finding of a vintage French bugle on a dying Vietnamese soldier, the Cornwall born Rescorla is replaced by a nameless Welsh platoon leader.

===Box office===
&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; grossed $78.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $37.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $115.4 million, against a budget of $75 million.

<text>The Laguna Fire, also known as the Kitchen Creek Fire or the Boulder Oaks Fire, was a wildfire that burned from September 22 to October 4, 1970, in the Laguna Mountains and East County region of San Diego County in Southern California. It was one of many wildfires in a massive conflagration that spanned across the state from September 22 to October 4, 1970. At the time, it was the second-largest fire in the recorded history of California after the 1932 Matilija Fire (not counting the Santiago Canyon Fire in 1889, which experts estimate burned approximately ).

==Progression==
The Laguna Fire was started by downed power lines during Santa Ana winds in the Kitchen Creek area of the Laguna Mountains on the morning of September 26, 1970. In only 30 hours, it burned westward about to the outskirts of El Cajon and Spring Valley. The fire devastated the communities of Harbison Canyon and Crest. In the end, the fire burned before it was contained on October 3, 1970.

== Effects ==
The Laguna Fire remained among the twenty largest California wildfires until as late as 2020, fifty years later, but it was surpassed by larger, more recent fires and no longer ranks among them.

Cal Fire records the Laguna Fire as having destroyed 382 structures, but reporting by &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; indicates that that figure accounts only for the number of homes destroyed, with more than 1,000 additional structures (such as outbuildings or commercial buildings) lost.

Additionally, Cal Fire lists a death toll of five for the Laguna Fire, while the &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; reports that eight civilians died, but were never identified and were believed to have been undocumented immigrants.

<doc id="1011471" wikidata="Q963419" url="?curid=1011471" title="Robin Beard">
<text>Robin Jerald Beard Jr. (August 21, 1939 – June 16, 2007) was an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Tennessee&#x27;s 6th congressional district, who served from 1973 to 1983.

==Early life==
Beard was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. He was educated at Montgomery Bell Academy and graduated from Vanderbilt University, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He was a former colonel in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

==Political career==
In 1970, Beard was appointed Tennessee personnel commissioner by newly elected Republican Governor Winfield Dunn. In 1972, he entered the GOP primary for the newly reconfigured 6th Congressional District. The district had been significantly redrawn by the state legislature, which shifted several Republican-trending portions near Memphis into the Sixth and removed several solidly Democratic areas.

In November, Beard defeated Anderson by twelve percentage points. Beard&#x27;s victory was not considered an upset, given the considerably more Republican bent of the redrawn district. Beard worked this district well over the next decade, building up a large following in a district where most of the living residents had never been represented by a Republican before. However, conservative Democrats continued to hold most of the district&#x27;s seats in the state legislature well into the 1980s.

Proving just how Republican this district had become at the national level, Beard was easily reelected in 1974 with 56.6 percent of the vote even as Republicans across the country were turned out of office due to anger over Watergate. In 1976, Beard faced former Senator Ross Bass, who had represented the 6th from 1955 to 1964. However, Beard turned back this challenge fairly easily, winning by almost 29 points. Despite his name recognition, Bass was unable to overcome the challenge of running in territory that he did not know and that did not know him. Beard took over 74 percent of the vote in 1978, and was unopposed in 1980.

Beard did not run for a sixth term in the 1982 elections, opting instead to run for the Republican nomination to oppose freshman Democratic Senator Jim Sasser. While Beard won the primary, he lost in a massive 20-point landslide. The Republicans would not win another statewide race until 1994, when they captured the governorship and both Senate seats.

Beard was appointed as a NATO deputy secretary-general in Belgium from 1984 to 1987, and from 1992 to 1995.

Beard later ran a Washington, D.C.–based import-export business and was at one time a resident of Alexandria, Virginia. Beard retired to Charleston County, South Carolina, where he later ran for a seat on the county school board in 2006 (Arthur Ravenel Jr., also a former U.S. Representative, ran successfully in the race.)

==Death==
Beard died from a brain tumor in Isle of Palms, South Carolina. His funeral was held at the Huguenot Church in Charleston, South Carolina.

<doc id="1011474" wikidata="Q423778" url="?curid=1011474" title="Potassium channel">
<text>Potassium channels are the most widely distributed type of ion channel found in virtually all organisms. They form potassium-selective pores that span cell membranes. Potassium channels are found in most cell types and control a wide variety of cell functions.

== Function ==
Potassium channels function to conduct potassium ions down their electrochemical gradient, doing so both rapidly (up to the diffusion rate of K+ ions in bulk water) and selectively (excluding, most notably, sodium despite the sub-angstrom difference in ionic radius). Biologically, these channels act to set or reset the resting potential in many cells. In excitable cells, such as neurons, the delayed counterflow of potassium ions shapes the action potential.

By contributing to the regulation of the cardiac action potential duration in cardiac muscle, malfunction of potassium channels may cause life-threatening arrhythmias. Potassium channels may also be involved in maintaining vascular tone.

They also regulate cellular processes such as the secretion of hormones (&quot;e.g.&quot;, insulin release from beta-cells in the pancreas) so their malfunction can lead to diseases (such as diabetes).

Some toxins, such as dendrotoxin, are potent because they block potassium channels.

==Types==
There are four major classes of potassium channels:

*Calcium-activated potassium channel - open in response to the presence of calcium ions or other signalling molecules.
*Inwardly rectifying potassium channel - passes current (positive charge) more easily in the inward direction (into the cell).
*Tandem pore domain potassium channel - are constitutively open or possess high basal activation, such as the &quot;resting potassium channels&quot; or &quot;leak channels&quot; that set the negative membrane potential of neurons.
*Voltage-gated potassium channel - are voltage-gated ion channels that open or close in response to changes in the transmembrane voltage.

The following table contains a comparison of the major classes of potassium channels with representative examples (for a complete list of channels within each class, see the respective class pages).

For more examples of pharmacological modulators of potassium channels, see potassium channel blocker and potassium channel opener.

== Structure ==
Potassium channels have a tetrameric structure in which four identical protein subunits associate to form a fourfold symmetric (C4) complex arranged around a central ion conducting pore (i.e., a homotetramer). Alternatively four related but not identical protein subunits may associate to form heterotetrameric complexes with pseudo C4 symmetry. All potassium channel subunits have a distinctive pore-loop structure that lines the top of the pore and is responsible for potassium selective permeability.

There are over 80 mammalian genes that encode potassium channel subunits. However potassium channels found in bacteria are amongst the most studied of ion channels, in terms of their molecular structure. Using X-ray crystallography, profound insights have been gained into how potassium ions pass through these channels and why (smaller) sodium ions do not. The 2003 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to Rod MacKinnon for his pioneering work in this area.

===Selectivity filter===
Potassium ion channels remove the hydration shell from the ion when it enters the selectivity filter. The selectivity filter is formed by a five residue sequence, TVGYG, termed the signature sequence, within each of the four subunits. This signature sequence is within a loop between the pore helix and TM2/6, historically termed the P-loop. This signature sequence is highly conserved, with the exception that a valine residue in prokaryotic potassium channels is often substituted with an isoleucine residue in eukaryotic channels. This sequence adopts a unique main chain structure, structurally analogous to a nest protein structural motif. The four sets of electronegative carbonyl oxygen atoms are aligned toward the center of the filter pore and form a square antiprism similar to a water-solvating shell around each potassium binding site. The distance between the carbonyl oxygens and potassium ions in the binding sites of the selectivity filter is the same as between water oxygens in the first hydration shell and a potassium ion in water solution, providing an energetically-favorable route for de-solvation of the ions. Sodium ions, however, are too small to fill the space between the carbonyl oxygen atoms. Thus, it is energetically favorable for sodium ions to remain bound with water molecules in the extracellular space, rather than to pass through the potassium-selective ion pore. This width appears to be maintained by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces within a sheet of aromatic amino acid residues surrounding the selectivity filter. The selectivity filter opens towards the extracellular solution, exposing four carbonyl oxygens in a glycine residue (Gly79 in KcsA). The next residue toward the extracellular side of the protein is the negatively charged Asp80 (KcsA). This residue together with the five filter residues form the pore that connects the water-filled cavity in the center of the protein with the extracellular solution.

====Selectivity mechanism====
The mechanism of potassium channel selectivity remains under continued debate. The carbonyl oxygens are strongly electro-negative and cation-attractive. The filter can accommodate potassium ions at 4 sites usually labelled S1 to S4 starting at the extracellular side. In addition, one ion can bind in the cavity at a site called SC or one or more ions at the extracellular side at more or less well-defined sites called S0 or Sext. Several different occupancies of these sites are possible. Since the X-ray structures are averages over many molecules, it is, however, not possible to deduce the actual occupancies directly from such a structure. In general, there is some disadvantage due to electrostatic repulsion to have two neighboring sites occupied by ions. Proposals for the mechanism of selectivity have been made based on molecular dynamics simulations, toy models of ion binding, thermodynamic calculations, topological considerations, and structural differences between selective and non-selective channels.

The mechanism for ion translocation in KcsA has been studied extensively by theoretical calculations and simulation. The prediction of an ion conduction mechanism in which the two doubly occupied states (S1, S3) and (S2, S4) play an essential role has been affirmed by both techniques. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest the two extracellular states, Sext and S0, reflecting ions entering and leaving the filter, also are important actors in ion conduction.

===Hydrophobic region===
This region neutralizes the environment around the potassium ion so that it is not attracted to any charges. In turn, it speeds up the reaction.

===Central cavity===
A central pore, 10 Å wide, is located near the center of the transmembrane channel, where the energy barrier is highest for the transversing ion due to the hydrophobity of the channel wall. The water-filled cavity and the polar C-terminus of the pore helices ease the energetic barrier for the ion. Repulsion by preceding multiple potassium ions is thought to aid the throughput of the ions.
The presence of the cavity can be understood intuitively as one of the channel&#x27;s mechanisms for overcoming the dielectric barrier, or repulsion by the low-dielectric membrane, by keeping the K+ ion in a watery, high-dielectric environment.

==Regulation==

The flux of ions through the potassium channel pore is regulated by two related processes, termed gating and inactivation. Gating is the opening or closing of the channel in response to stimuli, while inactivation is the rapid cessation of current from an open potassium channel and the suppression of the channel&#x27;s ability to resume conducting. While both processes serve to regulate channel conductance, each process may be mediated by a number of mechanisms.

Generally, gating is thought to be mediated by additional structural domains which sense stimuli and in turn open the channel pore. These domains include the RCK domains of BK channels, and voltage sensor domains of voltage gated K+ channels. These domains are thought to respond to the stimuli by physically opening the intracellular gate of the pore domain, thereby allowing potassium ions to traverse the membrane. Some channels have multiple regulatory domains or accessory proteins, which can act to modulate the response to stimulus. While the mechanisms continue to be debated, there are known structures of a number of these regulatory domains, including RCK domains of prokaryotic and eukaryotic channels, pH gating domain of KcsA, cyclic nucleotide gating domains, and voltage gated potassium channels.

N-type inactivation is typically the faster inactivation mechanism, and is termed the &quot;ball and chain&quot; model. N-type inactivation involves interaction of the N-terminus of the channel, or an associated protein, which interacts with the pore domain and occludes the ion conduction pathway like a &quot;ball&quot;. Alternatively, C-type inactivation is thought to occur within the selectivity filter itself, where structural changes within the filter render it non-conductive. There are a number of structural models of C-type inactivated K+ channel filters, although the precise mechanism remains unclear.

==Pharmacology==
===Blockers===

Potassium channel blockers inhibit the flow of potassium ions through the channel. They either compete with potassium binding within the selectivity filter or bind outside the filter to occlude ion conduction. An example of one of these competitors is quaternary ammonium ions, which bind at the extracellular face or central cavity of the channel. For blocking from the central cavity quaternary ammonium ions are also known as open channel blockers, as binding classically requires the prior opening of the cytoplasmic gate.

Barium ions can also block potassium channel currents, by binding with high affinity within the selectivity filter. This tight binding is thought to underlie barium toxicity by inhibiting potassium channel activity in excitable cells.

Medically potassium channel blockers, such as 4-aminopyridine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, have been investigated for the treatment of conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Off target drug effects can lead to drug induced Long QT syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. This is most frequently due to action on the hERG potassium channel in the heart. Accordingly, all new drugs are preclinically tested for cardiac safety.

===Activators===

==Muscarinic potassium channel== 

Some types of potassium channels are activated by muscarinic receptors and these are called &quot;muscarinic potassium channels&quot; (IKACh). These channels are a heterotetramer composed of two GIRK1 and two GIRK4 subunits. Examples are potassium channels in the heart, which, when activated by parasympathetic signals through M2 muscarinic receptors, cause an outward current of potassium, which slows down the heart rate.

== In fine art ==

Roderick MacKinnon commissioned &quot;Birth of an Idea&quot;, a tall sculpture based on the KcsA potassium channel. The artwork contains a wire object representing the channel&#x27;s interior with a blown glass object representing the main cavity of the channel structure.

<text>The Treaty of Seville was signed on 9 November 1729 between Britain, France, and Spain, formally ending the 1727–1729 Anglo-Spanish War; the Dutch Republic joined the Treaty on 29 November.

However, the Treaty failed to resolve underlying tensions that led first to the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear in 1739, then the wider War of the Austrian Succession in 1740.

== History ==

The Treaty of Seville was signed on 9 November 1729 between Britain, France, and Spain, formally ending the 1727–1729 Anglo-Spanish War; the Dutch Republic joined the Treaty on 29 November.

However, the Treaty failed to resolve underlying tensions that led first to the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear in 1739, then the wider War of the Austrian Succession in 1740.

==Background==

The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht confirmed Philip V as the first Bourbon king of Spain, in return for ceding Naples, Sicily, Milan and Sardinia. Britain also retained the Spanish ports of Gibraltar and Mahón, captured during the War of the Spanish Succession.

When Elisabeth Farnese became Philip&#x27;s second wife in 1714, he already had two sons who were next in line for the Spanish throne. She wanted to create an Italian inheritance for her own children, while Philip viewed regaining these territories as important for his prestige. Spain re-occupied Sardinia unopposed in 1717 but a landing on Sicily in 1718 led to the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The Royal Navy&#x27;s victory at Cape Passaro in August isolated the Spanish invasion force and ultimately forced them to surrender to Austrian troops in 1719.

In the 1720 Treaty of The Hague, Spain renounced its Italian possessions, in return for a guarantee Parma would go to Elisabeth&#x27;s eldest son Charles on the death of the childless Duke of Parma. The new British monarch, George I, agreed to raise the question of returning Gibraltar in Parliament &#x27;at a favourable opportunity.&#x27; Frustration at the lack of progress on this and commercial tensions led to the 1727 to 1729 Anglo-Spanish War.

Military action was primarily limited to an attack on Porto Bello, Panama by the British and an unsuccessful siege of Gibraltar by Spain, who also imposed restrictions on British merchants. The two countries agreed a truce in February 1728; hoping to deter Spain from an alliance with Austria, British envoy Benjamin Keene negotiated the Treaty of El Pardo in March. Considered too lenient by London, the agreement was repudiated, leading to the Congress of Soissons. There the British negotiated with a position of strength - a strategy that proved successful; most notably preventing a Spanish-Austrian alliance against Britain.

==Details==

The Treaty of Seville is best understood in the context of a number of European diplomatic issues over the period, one being Elisabeth Farnese&#x27;s desire for an Italian kingdom for her son. Another was the 1716 Anglo-French Alliance; although both sides grew increasingly suspicious of each other, the succession of George I in 1714 and his concern for Hanover made this more important to Britain than previously. Emperor Charles VI wanted the other Powers to support the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction and thus ensure the succession of his daughter Maria Theresa. Commercial issues included the Austrian-owned Ostend Company, which competed for the East Indies trade with British, French and Dutch merchants, as well as Spanish concerns over British incursions in New Spain.

The result was an almost continuous series of conferences and agreements, including the 1720 to 1724 Congress of Cambrai and the 1721 Treaty of Madrid. The 1725 Peace of Vienna between Austria and Spain was followed by the Treaty of Hanover, signed by France, Britain, Hanover and Prussia. Europe was on the verge of a general war, avoided when French chief minister Cardinal Fleury invited Austria, France and Britain to the Congress of Soissons, although Spain was excluded.

Trading privileges for British and French merchants in Cadiz were restored and compensation paid for losses, with an Anglo-Spanish commission established to discuss commercial issues in the Americas. Britain and France supported the rights of Elisabeth&#x27;s son Charles to Parma, with the addition of the Duchy of Tuscany; Spain could also send 6,000 troops to garrison the duchies in advance. These terms were presented to the Spanish, who signed on 9 November, the Dutch Republic joining the Treaty on 29th.

==Aftermath==

The Treaty failed to resolve underlying issues, such as the loss of Mahón and Gibraltar, while the Commission made little progress. The Anglo-French Alliance lapsed in 1731 and Britain agreed the 1731 Treaty of Vienna with Austria, although they co-operated with France to ensure Charles inherited Parma in 1732. As a result of the 1733 to 1735 War of the Polish Succession, he exchanged it for the Kingdom of Naples and in 1759 became king of Spain.

Anglo-Spanish tensions increased with the founding of the British colony of Georgia in 1732, which Spain considered a threat to Spanish Florida, vital to protect shipping routes with mainland Spain. For their part, the British viewed the 1733 &quot;Pacte de Famille&quot; between Louis XV and his uncle Philip as the first step in being replaced by France as Spain&#x27;s largest trading partner. These ultimately led first to the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear in 1739, then the 1740 to 1748 War of the Austrian Succession.

<text>&#x27; (), also known as &#x27;, is a traditional fermented milk product from Sweden, and a common dairy product within most of the Nordic countries. It is made by fermenting cow&#x27;s milk with a variety of bacteria from the species &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; and &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot;. The bacteria metabolize lactose, the sugar naturally found in milk, into lactic acid, which means people who are lactose intolerant can tolerate it better than other dairy products. The acid gives a sour taste and causes proteins in the milk, mainly casein, to coagulate, thus thickening the final product. The bacteria also produce a limited amount of diacetyl, a compound with a buttery flavor, which gives its characteristic taste.

 has a mild and slightly acidic taste. It has a shelf-life of around 10–14 days at refrigeration temperature.

== Overview ==

In the Nordic countries, is often eaten with breakfast cereal, muesli or crushed crisp bread on top. Some people add sugar, jam, apple sauce, cinnamon, ginger, fruits, or berries for extra flavor. 

In Norwegian it is called () (&#x27;sour milk&#x27;) or &quot;skjør/skyr&quot; but the official name is (). The drink is also popular in Latvian kitchens, where it is called , (&#x27;fermented milk&#x27; or &#x27;sour milk&#x27;) and can be bought ready from stores but is more commonly made at home. It can also be purchased and is popular in the neighboring country, Lithuania, where it is called or (&#x27;sour/fermented milk&#x27;). Due to its popularity, it can be bought in many stores alongside kefir.

Manufactured is made from pasteurised, homogenised, and standardised cow&#x27;s milk. Although homemade has been around for a long time (written records from the 18th century speak of -like products, but it has probably been around since the Viking Age or longer), it was first introduced to the Swedish market as a consumer product in 1931 by the Swedish dairy cooperative Arla. The first was unflavoured and contained 3% milkfat. Since the 1960s, different varieties of unflavoured have been marketed in Swedish grocery stores. , a more elastic variant of was introduced in 1965; &quot;lättfil&quot;, with 0.5% milkfat was introduced in 1967; and , with 1.5% milkfat, was introduced in 1990. 

In 1997, Arla introduced its first flavoured : strawberry-flavoured . The flavoured was so popular that different flavours soon followed. By 2001, almost one third of the sold in Sweden was flavoured . Since 2007, variations of include with various fat content, flavoured with fruit, vanilla, or honey, as well as with probiotic bacteria that is said to be more healthy, such as Onaka which contains Bifidobacterium lactis (a strain of bacteria popular in Japan) and Verum Hälsofil which contains &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; L1A in quantities of at least 10 billion live bacteria per deciliter.

==In English==
There is no single accepted English term for or . and/or has been translated to English as &quot;sour milk&quot;, &quot;soured milk&quot;, &quot;acidulated milk&quot;, &quot;fermented milk&quot;, and &quot;curdled milk&quot;, all of which are nearly synonymous and describe but do not differentiate from other types of soured/fermented milk. has also been described as &quot;viscous fermented milk&quot; and &quot;viscous mesophilic fermented milk&quot;. Furthermore, articles written in English can be found that use the Swedish term &quot;&quot;, as well as the Anglicised spellings &quot;filmjolk&quot;, &quot; mjölk&quot;, and &quot; mjolk&quot;.

In baking, when is called for, cultured buttermilk can be substituted.

==In Finland Swedish==

In Finland Swedish, the dialects spoken by the Swedish-speaking population of Finland, &quot;&quot; is the equivalent of &quot;filbunke&quot; in Sweden. Not all variants of are found in Finland, normally only and &quot;långfil&quot;. Swedish-speakers in Finland usually use the word , which is the older name for &quot;&quot; (also in Sweden) or (in Finnish), which is a fermented milk product that is thinner than and resembles cultured buttermilk.

==Types in Sweden==
In Sweden, there are five Swedish dairy cooperatives that produce : Arla Foods, Falköpings Mejeri, Gefleortens Mejeri, Norrmejerier, and Skånemejerier. In addition, Wapnö AB, a Swedish dairy company, and Valio, a Finnish dairy company, also sell a limited variety of in Sweden. Prior to the industrial manufacture of , many families made at home.

 culture is a variety of bacterium from the species &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; and &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot;, e.g., Arla&#x27;s culture contains &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; subsp. &quot;lactis&quot;, &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; subsp. &quot;cremoris&quot;, &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; biovar. &quot;diacetylactis&quot;, and &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot; subsp. &quot;cremoris&quot;.

===Classic variants===
===Probiotic variants===
==Homemade &quot;filmjölk&quot;==
To make , a small amount of bacteria from an active batch of is normally transferred to pasteurised milk and then left one to two days to ferment at room temperature or in a cool cellar. The culture is needed when using pasteurised milk because the bacteria occurring naturally in milk are killed during the pasteurisation process.

==&quot;Tätmjölk&quot;==
A variant of called , , or is made by rubbing the inside of a container with leaves of certain plants: sundew (&quot;Drosera&quot;, ) or butterwort (&quot;Pinguicula&quot;, ). Lukewarm milk is added to the container and left to ferment for one to two days. More &#x27; can then be made by adding completed &#x27; to milk. In &quot;Flora Lapponica&quot; (1737), Carl von Linné described a recipe for &quot;&quot; and wrote that any species of butterwort could be used to make it.

Sundew and butterwort are carnivorous plants that have enzymes that degrade proteins, which make the milk thick. How butterwort influences the production of &quot;&quot; is not completely understood – lactic acid bacteria have not been isolated during analyses of butterwort.

<doc id="1011488" wikidata="Q460003" url="?curid=1011488" title="Raúl Cubas Grau">
<text>Raúl Alberto Cubas Grau (born 23 August 1943) is a Paraguayan politician and electrical engineer who served as the 45th President of Paraguay from 1998 until his resignation in 1999.

A &quot;colorado&quot; and loyal follower of Lino Oviedo, who could not run for president due to his imprisonment, Cubas was elected in 1998 alongside his running mate, Luis María Argaña, a &quot;colorado&quot; &quot;caudillo&quot; who had become Oviedo&#x27;s biggest political rival.

In March of 1999, large protests against Cubas&#x27; government erupted following the assassination of Vice President Argaña. As a result of these days of social unrest, which came to be known as the Marzo Paraguayo, Cubas resigned and was succeeded by the president of the Senate, Luis González Macchi. Cubas&#x27; presidency only lasted six months.

==Early life==
Cubas Grau studied Engineering at the National University of Asunción.

He was a member of the Colorado Party. Prior to being elected president, he worked as an electrical engineer, and served as Minister of Finance of Paraguay for a brief period in April 1996 under president Juan Carlos Wasmosy until he resigned.

==Presidency (1998–1999)==
When the 1998 campaign began, army general Lino Oviedo named Cubas as his running mate. However, a few months before the election, Oviedo was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in a 1996 coup attempt and was disqualified. Cubas took his place on the ballot and won the May 1998 election with 54% of the vote under the slogan &quot;Cubas in government, Oviedo in power.&quot; To date, it is the only time since the restoration of democracy in Paraguay that a presidential candidate has won an outright majority.

In June, the Paraguayan Congress passed a law that said that the president could not pardon anyone who had not served at least half of their prison term, a law which was seen to be made to avoid Cubas pardoning his former running mate Oviedo. In August, however, three days after his inauguration, Cubas reduced Oviedo&#x27;s sentence to the time already served, effectively releasing him from jail. Despite an order from the Paraguayan Supreme Court in December 1998, Cubas refused to send Oviedo back to jail. 

In response, the Chamber of Deputies voted to charge Cubas with abuse of power in February 1999. The vote was only two votes short of that necessary for a formal impeachment. Cubas&#x27; vice president, Luis María Argaña, who had been named as Cubas&#x27; running mate to prevent the Colorados from losing power but was leading the anti-Oviedo bloc in the Colorado Party, was assassinated on March 23, 1999, allegedly as a result of a dispute over the Oviedo release. His murder was allegedly done by a group with ties to Oviedo. Cubas was implicated and protests broke out. Thousands participated in public demonstrations led by striking workers, demanding that Cubas resign. Security forces were called out. Seven people were shot to death and dozens were injured when the demonstrations turned violent, in what became known as the &quot;Marzo paraguayo&quot; (&quot;Paraguayan March&quot;).

Cubas&#x27; support virtually collapsed. The day after the assassination, the Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly to impeach Cubas. Facing certain conviction and removal from office by the Senate, Cubas resigned on March 28, 1999, while Oviedo fled to Brazil. Oviedo returned to Paraguay in 2004 to face his charges both for the 1996 coup attempt and the killing of protesters during the &quot;Marzo paraguayo&quot;, and was immediately imprisoned. He was released on parole for good behavior on 6 September 2007, and between 2007 and 2008, both cases would be dismissed.

==Kidnapping and murder of daughter==
In October 2004, his daughter Cecilia Cubas was kidnapped by gunmen near her Asuncion apartment. Paraguayan security forces began an intense search for her, and Cubas paid a ransom of US$800,000. However, her body was found in the basement of a house outside Asunción in February 2005. She was 32 years old. Four men were arrested, including one with alleged ties to the Colombian rebel movement FARC. In July 2006, two suspects of the crime were granted refugee status in neighboring Bolivia.

<doc id="1011498" wikidata="Q7170450" url="?curid=1011498" title="Person of interest">
<text>&quot;Person of interest&quot; is a term used by law enforcement in the United States, Canada, and other countries when identifying someone possibly involved in a criminal investigation who has not been arrested or formally accused of a crime. It has no legal meaning, but refers to someone in whom the police and/or domestic intelligence services are &quot;interested&quot;, either because the person is cooperating with the investigation, may have information that would assist the investigation, or possesses certain characteristics that merit further attention.

While terms such as &quot;suspect&quot;, &quot;target&quot;, and &quot;material witness&quot; have clear and sometimes formal definitions, &quot;person of interest&quot; remains undefined by the U.S. Department of Justice. &quot;Unsub&quot; is a similar term which is short for &quot;unknown subject&quot; (used in the TV show &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;). &quot;Person of interest&quot; is usually used as a euphemism for &quot;suspect&quot;, and its careless use may encourage trials by media. 

With respect to terrorism investigations, Eric Lichtblau wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;Law enforcement officials say that the term simply reflects the new tactics required to fight terrorism. But some legal scholars say officials are trying to create a more benign public image, even as their power expands.&quot;

==History==
This phrase was first utilized by law enforcement in 1986, during the investigation of the Green River Killer. It was coined by Fae Brooks, a member of the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Department at the time of the investigation.

According to Eric Lichtbau in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

The term was used widely in mass media at least as early as the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing in reference to Richard A. Jewell. Its initial uses aroused controversy, but it has since seen increasingly regular use. Jewell later remarked on the use of the term:

===&quot;Hatfill v. Ashcroft&quot;===
The use of the term became widely critiqued when United States Attorney General John Ashcroft used it in a press conference when asked if Dr. Steven J. Hatfill was a suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks case. In 2002, Hatfill&#x27;s attorney filed a complaint with the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility, arguing that &quot;the term is not recognized in law or criminal procedure and that Ashcroft did not have the right &#x27;to preside over the public shredding of [Hatfill&#x27;s] life. This is un-American. Mr. Ashcroft owes Dr. Hatfill an apology. Hatfill sued the Department of Justice for violation of federal privacy law; the case was settled in 2008 for $5.8 million.

==Definition==
Normal Justice Department parlance for subjects of investigation includes &quot;suspect&quot;, &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;target&quot;. Each has specific meanings relevant to different levels of investigation. Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote to the Attorney General for clarification of the unfamiliar phrase in September 2002. In December of that year, Nuclear Threat Initiative&#x27;s Global Security Newswire summarized the response as follows:

<doc id="1011525" wikidata="Q1192485" url="?curid=1011525" title="Trial balance">
<text>A trial balance is an internal financial statement that lists the adjusted closing balances of all the general ledger accounts (both revenue and capital) contained in the ledger of a business as at a specific date. This list will contain the name of each nominal ledger account in the order of liquidity and the value of that nominal ledger balance. Each nominal ledger account will hold either a debit balance or a credit balance. The debit balance values will be listed in the debit column of the trial balance and the credit value balance will be listed in the credit column. The trading profit and loss statement and balance sheet and other financial reports can then be produced using the ledger accounts listed on the same balance.

== History ==
The first published description of the process is found in Luca Pacioli&#x27;s 1494 work &quot;Summa de arithmetica&quot;, in the section titled &quot;Particularis de Computis et Scripturis&quot;. Although he did not use the term, he essentially prescribed a technique similar to a post-closing trial balance.

== Usage ==
The primary purpose of preparing a trial balance is to ensure the accuracy of an entity&#x27;s double-entry bookkeeping system. Accounting equation rule states that there must be equal debit and credit for every financial transaction, therefore, the value of all the debit and credit balances on trial balance must be equal. If the total of the debit column does not equal the total value of the credit column then this would show that there is an error in the nominal ledger accounts. This error must be found before a profit and loss statement and balance sheet can be produced. Hence trial balance is important in case of adjustments. Whenever any adjustment is performed run trial balance and confirm if all the debit amount is equal to credit amount.

The trial balance is usually prepared by a bookkeeper or accountant who has used daybooks to record financial transactions and then post them to the nominal ledgers and personal ledger accounts. The trial balance is a part of the double-entry bookkeeping system and uses the classic &#x27;T&#x27; account format for presenting values.

==Normal Balances==
Normal Balances refer to whether the balance for an account in a properly-formed trial balance is usually a debt or a credit. A normal balance also reflects the accounting equation. If a trial balance for an account is reversed, such an account is called a &quot;contra-account&quot; (e.g. accumulated depreciation as an asset or owners drawings as equity). The normal balances are as follow:

The sum total of each column should be equal, or &quot;balance.&quot; The act of &quot;closing the books&quot; refers to zeroing out all the revenue and expense amounts at the end of an accounting period (typically a fiscal year) and adding the difference to the retained earnings account. This is called a &quot;closing entry.&quot; If the company earned a profit, the retained earnings account will be increased. If the company experienced a loss, the retained earnings account will be reduced. The resulting opening balance for the new accounting period will still have columns of equal sum totals.

== Limitations ==
A trial balance only checks the sum of debits against the sum of credits. That is why it does not guarantee that there are no errors. The following are the main classes of errors that are not detected by the trial balance.

*An error of original entry is when both sides of a transaction include the wrong amount. For example, if a purchase invoice for £21 is entered as £12, this will result in an incorrect debit entry (to purchases), and an incorrect credit entry (to the relevant creditor account), both for £9 less, so the total of both columns will be £9 less, and will thus balance.
*An error of omission is when a transaction is completely omitted from the accounting records. As the debits and credits for the transaction would balance, omitting it would still leave the totals balanced. A variation of this error is omitting one of the ledger account totals from the trial balance (but in this case the trial balance will not balance).
*An error of reversal is when entries are made to the correct amount, but with debits instead of credits, and vice versa. For example, if a cash sale for £100 is debited to the Sales account, and credited to the Cash account. Such an error will not affect the totals. An error of reversal may occasionally be detected if the trial balance is not a normal balance - such as cash having a credit balance.
*An error of commission is when the entries are made at the correct amount, and the appropriate side (debit or credit), but one or more entries are made to the wrong account of the correct type. For example, if fuel costs are incorrectly debited to the postage account (both expense accounts). This will not affect the totals. This can also occur due to confusion in revenue and capital expenditure.
*An error of principle is when the entries are made to the correct amount, and the appropriate side (debit or credit), as with an error of commission, but the &quot;wrong&quot; type of account is used. For example, if fuel costs (an expense account), are debited to stock (an asset account). This will not affect the totals. 
*Compensating errors are multiple unrelated errors that would individually lead to an imbalance, but together cancel each other out.

<text>Dylan Jeremy Neal (born October 8, 1969) is a Canadian actor. He is known for his portrayal of the character Dylan Shaw on the soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, Doug Witter on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, and Detective Mike Celluci in the supernatural series &quot;Blood Ties&quot;. He also played Aaron Jacobs on &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;.

In 2013, Neal landed the lead role opposite Andie MacDowell in the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s first scripted TV series, &quot;Cedar Cove&quot;. The series premiered on July 20, 2013, and is based on the series of books by the same name, written by Debbie Macomber. 
In 2014, he sold a TV movie franchise to the newly rebranded Hallmark Movies and Mystery Channel and began writing, executive producing and starring as Henry Ross in Hallmark&#x27;s original mystery series &quot;Gourmet Detective&quot;. As of 2018, Dylan continues to write, produce and star in a variety of movies for Hallmark.

==Personal life==
Dylan Neal was born in Richmond Hill, Ontario, in 1969. Four months after his birth, his family moved to Oakville, Ontario. He attended Appleby College in Oakville and initially wanted to become a professional squash player.

Neal transferred to T. A. Blakelock High School in Oakville for his last two years of schooling. It was there that he gained an interest in the performing arts and participated in his school&#x27;s drama program. On the advice of his drama teacher, Neal decided he wanted to make a career of acting.

Before becoming an actor, Neal was a caterer and delivered lunch baskets to private businesses in industrial areas around Toronto. He also delivered pizzas for a living before making it as an actor. He has been passionate about furniture making.

Neal is married to TV writer and producer Becky Southwell who has co-written some of the &quot;Gourmet Detective&quot; films with him. They were married on 21 September 1996 and have two children together.

==Career==
Neal has said that after finishing his work on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, he was initially concerned about his ability to find another acting job. &quot;There are certain expectations--or a certain lack of expectations--of soap opera actors,&quot; he said.

From 1998 to 2003, he portrayed Doug Witter, a small-town police officer, in the WB television drama &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. In the final season of the series, his character was revealed to be homosexual.

In 2000, Neal played a secret agent opposite Chuck Norris in the television film &quot;The President&#x27;s Man.&quot; It premiered on April 2 on CBS.

In 2007, Neal played Detective Mike Celluci in Lifetime&#x27;s Canadian vampire fantasy show &quot;Blood Ties&quot;, in which he starred alongside Christina Cox and Kyle Schmid. The producers of the show ultimately chose Neal, Cox, and Schmid as the three leads of the show over other auditioning actors after observing the natural chemistry among the trio. Neal later commented that fans often compliment the three actors for their charming on-screen chemistry and camaraderie.

Neal played the male lead opposite Andie MacDowell in the television series &quot;Cedar Cove&quot; for the Hallmark Channel. Neal played Jack Griffith, a Philadelphia reporter. He played Bob Adams, stepfather to the main character Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), in the film adaptation &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; (2015).

Neal and his wife, Becky Southwell, write and produce their own projects through Southwell Neal Entertainment. They write and executive produce the &quot;Gourmet Detective&quot; original films for Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries, based on the novels by Peter King. As of February 2020, Neal has made five television movies based on the character.

<doc id="1011550" wikidata="Q376549" url="?curid=1011550" title="Juan Carlos Wasmosy">
<text>Juan Carlos Wasmosy Monti (born December 15, 1938) is a Paraguayan former politician and engineer who was the 44th president of Paraguay from 1993 to 1998. He was a member of the Colorado Party, and the country&#x27;s first freely elected president, as well as the first civilian president in 39 years.

== Biography ==
Born in Asunción, Wasmosy trained as a civil engineer and became head of the Paraguayan consortium working on the Itaipu Dam. During this project, he amassed a large amount of wealth. He served as minister of integration under President Andrés Rodríguez.

His ancestors, Dániel and József Vámosy, immigrated to South America from Debrecen, Hungary in 1828. At that time, the surname of the family was Vámosy; it was Hispanicized to Wasmosy. His relative, Alceu Wamosy (1895–1923), a famous Brazilian writer, is also from this ancestry. Juan Carlos Wasmosy went to see the home town of his ancestors in 1995 during his official visit to Hungary.

Rodríguez endorsed Wasmosy as his successor in the 1993 elections. He won with almost 42 percent of the vote, in what is generally acknowledged to be the first (largely) free and fair election in the country&#x27;s history (the country had gained independence in 1811), with Domingo Laino finishing a close second. Although there were confirmed cases of fraud, a team of international observers led by Jimmy Carter concluded that Wasmosy&#x27;s margin of victory was large enough to offset any wrongdoing. Carter also noted that opposition candidates took 60 percent of the vote between them. This was a remarkable figure given Paraguay&#x27;s long history of autocratic rule. For most of the country&#x27;s history, particularly during Alfredo Stroessner&#x27;s 35-year dictatorship, the opposition was barely tolerated when it was even permitted at all. At the time of Stroessner&#x27;s ouster in 1989, the country had only known two years of true democracy in its entire history.

However, he became very unpopular when he appointed many of Stroessner&#x27;s supporters to government posts. He also failed to continue the limited reforms of Rodríguez. A principal obstacle was the factional nature of the party, which contributed in the stalling of many of his priorities. He was a solid conservative who approved market-oriented policies. He oversaw the privatization of the national airline, merchant fleet and steel company. 

Lino Oviedo, head of the Paraguayan army, allegedly attempted a coup in April 1996. Wasmosy countered by offering Oviedo a ministerial position, but soon imprisoned him. When he made the offer to Oviedo, many Paraguans accused him of undermining the civilian government and organized massive demonstrations in the capital.

Wasmosy was barred from running again in 1998; in response to Stroessner&#x27;s authoritarian excesses, the 1992 constitution barred any sort of reelection for the president. Raúl Cubas stood for the Colorado Party presidential nomination and won.

In 2002, Wasmosy was convicted of defrauding the Paraguayan state and was himself sentenced to four years in prison. The sentence was later appealed. Upon appeal, his sentence was reduced to bail and house arrest. As a former president of Paraguay, he was made a senator for life.

<text>The Albania national football team () represents Albania in men&#x27;s international football. It is governed by the Albanian Football Federation (FSHF), the governing body for football in Albania. It is a member of UEFA in Europe and FIFA in global competitions. The team&#x27;s colours reference two national symbols: the double-headed eagle and the country&#x27;s tricolor. Their supporters are colloquially referred to as the &quot;Tifozat Kuq e Zi&quot; (Red and Black Fans).

Since its inception as a team, Albania first collected a major tournament trophy in 1946 with the Balkan Cup, followed by the Malta International Tournament (2000). At the FIFA World Cup, Albania has campaigned to qualify since their entry into FIFA in 1932. The team has reached the group stage of UEFA European Championship twice (2016, 2024). They have competed in the UEFA Nations League since 2018. 

Upon its admission into FIFA ranked 124th, Albania ascended to their peak World Ranking of 22nd in 2015. The country plays their home games in the Arena Kombëtare in their capital city, Tirana.

==History==
===20th century===

Although it never played any matches, the Albania national football team existed before the Albanian Football Association (Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit; FSHF) was created on 6 June 1930. Albania joined FIFA during a congress held between 12 and 16 June. Albania was invited to play in the 1934 World Cup, but did not take part due to logistical problems. Albania played its first international match against Yugoslavia in 1946, which ended in a 3–2 home defeat at Qemal Stafa Stadium. In 1946, Albania also participated for the first time in the Balkan Cup in which Albania won by beating Romania 1–0 in the final. In 1954, Albania was one of the founding members of UEFA. Albania waited until 1962 to compete in a Euro Cup competition, and the reason being Albania got past the first leg against Greece, for political reasons forfeited the game. At the end of the tournament Albania ranked 9th in Europe. Albania participated at the 1964 Summer Olympics in the Men&#x27;s qualification tournament, and closely lost both matches against Bulgaria in the preliminary round. They would participate for the second and last time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in which they faced Romania at the European qualifiers in the playoffs. Albania would lose both matches narrowly, 2–1 in the first leg and at home in the second leg.
Albania participated for the first time in a qualifying phase of a World Cup in 1966. The team was drawn in the Group 5, finishing in the last position with only one point from six matches. In the qualifiers of UEFA Euro 1968, Albania drew 0–0 against West Germany, denying the Germans a chance to participate in the finals. Albania did not participate in World Cup 1970, UEFA Euro 1976, World Cup 1978 and UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying for unknown political reasons.

After six years without playing any international matches, Albania entered the 1982 World Cup, managing to finish second-to-last in the qualifying stages. For qualifying for the World Cup four years later, Albania beat Belgium in Tirana 2–0 as well as drawing Poland in Mielec 2–2.

===21st century===
In the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, Albania only beat Greece. For the Euros two years later, Albania beat Russia 3–1 at Loro Boriçi Stadium. This match was also the debut of the German coach Hans-Peter Briegel who led Albania to an undefeated run in home matches. Despite good results, Albania finished in the penultimate spot with only eight points. Albania defeated Greece 2–1 two months after they won Euro 2004.

In Euro 2008 qualifying, Albania defeated Luxembourg twice, and also drew 2–2 with Belarus and 0–0 away with Bulgaria. Albania&#x27;s Euro campaign ended with a 6–1 loss away to Romania which resulted in the resignation of coach Otto Barić and his assistant. In December 2007, Arie Haan was named Albania&#x27;s head coach by signing a two-year contract for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. Albania won only one match, with seven points from ten matches and Haan was replaced by Josip Kuže in May 2009 following the end of the campaign. However, Kuže failed to lead Albania to better results as the team ended the Euro 2012 qualifying with nine points from ten matches. With Kuže in charge, Albania recorded its second biggest win in history by defeating Cyprus 6–1 at home. Josip Kuže parted ways with Albania after three and a half years, and in December 2011, Italian coach Gianni de Biasi replaced him. Albania was, at one point, second in the 2014 World Cup qualifying group, but then lost to Slovenia and Iceland, as well as at home against Switzerland, and drawing in Cyprus.Albania began UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I with an emphatic 1–0 away win against Portugal, followed by a 1–1 draw against Denmark at the newly renovated Elbasan Arena. They then beat Serbia 3–0 in a match full of incidents. They finally qualified for a Euro, its first appearance at a major men&#x27;s football tournament. In the tournament itself, Albania lost 1–0 to Switzerland and 2–0 to hosts France. While they beat Romania 1–0 (their first win against Romania since 1947), the team finished last among the third-placed teams and were eliminated in the group stage.

In 2018 World Cup qualification, Albania was drawn in a group with Spain, Italy, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, and Israel. Despite the difficult draw, they placed third in the group, their best result in history without qualifying for the final tournament. During this time, manager Gianni De Biasi resigned after disputes with the FSHF and was replaced by Christian Panucci. Albania played poorly in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, winning only once against Israel and losing the return leg as well as both matches against Scotland. Panucci would be sacked after a 2–0 defeat to Turkey in the opening match of UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying. Edoardo Reja replaced Panucci as Albania faced home and away series against both 2018 FIFA World Cup champions France and Iceland as well as the return leg against Turkey. In the end, Albania placed fourth in the group, failing to qualify.

Albania qualified for UEFA Euro 2024, their second major tournament. They were drawn into a &quot;group of death&quot; against Spain, Italy, and Croatia, all three opponents being Euros and World Cup medalists. With two losses to Spain and Italy and a draw against Croatia, the team finished at the bottom of their group and did not advance.

Albania is set to compete in the UEFA Nations League B in fall 2024, followed by qualification matches for the 2026 World Cup.

==Team image==
===Nicknames===
The team&#x27;s nickname is commonly known as &quot;Kuqezinjtë&quot; (&quot;The Red and Blacks&quot;) During the period before 2016, the national teams of Albania and Kosovo exchanged players with each other due to the complexities of descent brought on by Kosovo&#x27;s independence, leading supporters to refer to each team as the other team&#x27;s &quot;reserve&quot; side.

===Kits===

Albania&#x27;s uniform colors are red and black, mirroring the nation&#x27;s flag. The team typically wears red shirts, black shorts and red socks. Away kits are usually all-white, with red and black trimming.

Over the years, the national team has sported kit wear from renowned sportswear brands such as Legea, Puma, Nike and Adidas, to name a few. The partnership with Puma began in 1996 and lasted nine years. Nike outfitted the team during the UEFA Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. A collaboration with Adidas followed, in a contract signing which allowed it to manufacture kits for the Euro 2012 qualifiers, as well as the 2014 World Cup and the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

On 24 March 2016, the Albanian Football Federation unveiled a new jersey for the national team players, set to be worn during the forthcoming UEFA Euro 2016 tournament, hosted that year in France. Manufactured by Macron, the jersey redesign, labelled &quot;Triumfi,&quot; was conceptualised by Tirana-based studio PIK Creative.

===Home stadium===

For most of Albania&#x27;s history, the home stadium was Qemal Stafa Stadium in Tirana. Construction started in April 1939 during the Italy regime, lasted for three years but stopped briefly in August 1943 following the fall of fascist regime. The stadium had an Olympic Stadium shape, as idealised by Gherardo Bosio, a young fascist architect from Florence. The stadium&#x27;s initial capacity was 15,000, due to the fact that Tirana at that time had only 60,000 inhabitants. It was named after Qemal Stafa, a Hero of Albania in World War II. The stadium was inaugurated officially on 7 October 1946 when Albania played its first competitive match against Yugoslavia. Ever since then, a further 130 international matches took place in the stadium, with the last being a friendly against Georgia in November 2015. In 2005, Cecilia de Marco and Elisabetta Lorusso, two young Italian students, called the stadium as &quot;one of the strongest symbols of Italian impact in Albania&quot;. In November 2013, Qemal Stafa Stadium was shut down by FIFA for not fulfilling international standards. The stadium&#x27;s demolition started in June 2016, and it was announced that it would be replaced by Arena Kombëtare.

Albania has played home matches at other venues; outside Tirana, the national team has played matches in Flamurtari Stadium in Vlorë, Tomori Stadium in Berat, Niko Dovana Stadium in Durrës, Loro Boriçi Stadium in Shkodër and Elbasan Arena in Elbasan. In February 2014, renovations for Elbasan Arena (at the time Ruzhdi Bizhuta Stadium) started. The work lasted for seven months, and the stadium was inaugurated on 9 October when Albania played a friendly match against KF Elbasani&#x27;s under-19 squad; Albania won the match 17–0. The official inauguration occurred two days later in the Euro 2016 qualifying match against Denmark.

The first international match at Loro Boriçi Stadium was played on 29 March 2003 against Russia, with Albania winning 3–1. In October 2014, Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, promised the reconstruction of the stadium. The stadium&#x27;s construction started in May 2015 and finished in August 2016. In 2016–17, the stadium served temporary as the home of Kosovo national team, due to stadiums in Mitrovica and Pristina being renovated and not meeting UEFA standards.

===Rivalries===
====Kosovo====

This derby is otherwise known as Brotherly derby (), or the Brotherly (). The documented beginnings of this derby date back to World War II, specifically on 29 November 1942, where they played a friendly match as part of the celebrations for the 30th anniversary of the independence of Albania. The match ended with a 2–0 win for Tirana.

====Serbia====

This football rivalry between Albania and Serbia is mainly due to historical tensions between the two countries. It has been described as &quot;one of the fiercest rivalries in the world&quot;. During the Euro 2016 qualifying phase, with Portugal, Denmark and Armenia, the Serbian crowd were chanting &quot;kill, kill Albanians&quot; and were throwing flares at Albania, after which there was a clash between the two teams.

Both countries were drawn in the same group for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, with England, Latvia and Andorra.

===Supporters===
Tifozat Kuq e Zi (Red and Black Fans) is a non-profit football supporters&#x27; association for the Albania national football team and various national team sportive activities. It was founded on 25 December 2003. In cooperation with FSHF, it organises trips for football fans to visit games, and develops and sells merchandise to support itself and fund sporting related projects.

Tifozat Kuq e Zi stands firm in the political view that Albanians should share only one national team and have continuous aspirations to join in one state (Një Komb, Një Kombëtare), i.e. unification of Albania, Kosovo, etc. In this sense, TKZ is joined by different supporters&#x27; associations throughout Albanian-speaking regions mainly in Kosovo (Shqiponjat of Peja, Kuqezinjet e Jakoves of Gjakova, Plisat of Prishtina, Torcida of Mitrovica, etc.), North Macedonia (Ballistët of Tetovë, Ilirët of Kumanovë, Shvercerat of Shkupi, etc.) and in Albania itself (Ultras Guerrils of Partizani Tirana, Tirona Fanatics of KF Tirana, Vllaznit Ultras of Vllaznia Shkodër, Ujqërit e Deborës of Skënderbeu Korçë, Shqiponjat of KF Besa Pejë and many other different Albanian fans).
The ongoing dispute between the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports and the Football Federation of Albania has been seen as a political intrusion by FIFA and UEFA, which led to the banning of Albania from international sportive activities. FSHF president Armand Duka is highly unwanted by the TKZ who have numerously asked for his resignation believing he is responsible for internal corruption in the Albanian Football Federation.

The TKZ have been praised by many different football players and managers, whom were not just Albanian. One example is with Switzerland&#x27;s former coach, Ottmar Hitzfeld, who was astonished by how many Albanian fans turned up and how enthusiastic they were in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying match between Switzerland and Albania where the Swiss won 2–0 thanks to goals from Gökhan Inler and Kosovo-born Xherdan Shaqiri. He didn&#x27;t believe that there was 12,000 Albanian fans in the stands which was more than how many Swiss fans turned up for the game. He stated that &quot;Albanian fans are fantastic and the most passionate fans I have ever seen&quot;. During that campaign, TKZ attended all games Albania played apart from a match against Cyprus in Nicosia and were also large in numbers in the away games to Slovenia in Maribor and Norway in Oslo.

<text>Suzana Drobnjakovic ( on May 17, 1973), known by her stage name Sasha Alexander, is an American actress and television director. She played Gretchen Witter in &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; and has acted in films including &quot;Yes Man&quot; (2008) and &quot;He&#x27;s Just Not That Into You&quot; (2009). Alexander played Caitlin Todd for the first two seasons of &quot;NCIS&quot; (2003–2005). From July 2010 through September 2016, Alexander starred as Maura Isles in the TNT series &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot;, and was a regular in Season 5 and 6 of &quot;Shameless&quot; in 2015–2016.

== Early life ==
Alexander, who is of Serbian and Italian descent, was born Suzana Drobnjakovic in Los Angeles, California. She began acting in school productions in the seventh grade. She was also an ice skater, but stopped due to a knee injury. She continued acting through high school and college, then moved to New York City to act in summer stock and Shakespeare festivals. She graduated from the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinema-Television, where she was a member of the sorority Kappa Alpha Theta.

== Career ==
Alexander got her acting start on two short-lived series: the medical drama &quot;Presidio Med&quot; and ABC&#x27;s twenty-something drama &quot;Wasteland&quot;. She achieved widespread media attention and critical praise when she appeared in the fourth season of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; as Gretchen Witter, the sister of Pacey Witter, and dated the title character. Alexander was also in an episode of the short-lived Fox comedy series &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot;, in which she played the role of a lesbian &quot;TV Guide&quot; reporter and shared an onscreen kiss with Sarah Silverman.

Alexander appeared in the films &quot;Lucky 13&quot; and &quot;All Over the Guy&quot;, as well as &quot;He&#x27;s Just Not That Into You&quot; (in the role of Catherine), the independent movie &quot;The Last Lullaby&quot;, and &quot;Yes Man&quot; (as Lucy) starring Jim Carrey. She appeared as District Attorney Robin Childs in the episode &quot;Alter Boys&quot;, and she appeared in an episode of &quot;Friends&quot; (&quot;The One with Joey&#x27;s Interview&quot;), playing a &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; reporter who interviewed Joey.

Alexander joined &quot;NCIS&quot; as Secret Service/NCIS Special Agent Caitlin &quot;Kate&quot; Todd in 2003. Her character replaced Vivian Blackadder, played by Robyn Lively, who had appeared in the backdoor pilot episodes &quot;Ice Queen&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot; on &quot;JAG&quot;. The official pilot episode &quot;Yankee White&quot; aired September 23, 2003, on CBS. Alexander&#x27;s two year tenure on the show ended in May 2005 when her character, Kate, is killed by a terrorist who shoots her in the head during the last few seconds of the season-two finale, &quot;Twilight&quot;.

The official explanation for her departure was that &quot;she asked to be let out of her contract to pursue other opportunities&quot;. In statements made by Alexander since her departure from &quot;NCIS&quot;, she has made clear that her problem with the show was that she felt the workload was too physically demanding for her.

In subsequent television series work, episode counts were considerably smaller, and her character portrayals required less physical effort than her role on &quot;NCIS&quot;. In her final appearances in the two-part episode &quot;Kill Ari&quot;, Alexander was credited as a special guest star. Her character Caitlin Todd reappeared in a &quot;what if&quot; scenario with Anthony DiNozzo for the &quot;NCIS&quot; 200th episode &quot;Life Before His Eyes&quot; in 2012, however, Alexander did not return to film new footage for the episode; rather footage from the second season episode &quot;SWAK&quot; was recut to incorporate her into the new episode.

<doc id="1011583" wikidata="Q5876958" url="?curid=1011583" title="Hog Island, Philadelphia">
<text>Hog Island is the historic name of an area southeast of Tinicum Township, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Delaware River, to the west of the mouth of the Schuylkill River. Part of Philadelphia International Airport now occupies Hog Island and the infilled channel behind it. It was the site of a major shipyard during World War I; sandwiches made for workers there may be the origin of the name &quot;hoagie&quot;.

==History==
European settlers purchased Hog Island from the Lenape (Delaware) tribe in 1680. The settlers gradually developed the island by building log and earthwork dikes to minimize storm damage and convert the marshes into good grazing meadows. Hog Island supposedly got its name from the pigs which local residents left to roam free, as no fencing was needed.

In 1917, as part of the World War I effort, the U.S. government contracted American International Shipbuilding Corp. to build ships and a shipyard at Hog Island. At the time, Hog Island was the largest shipyard in the world, with 50 slipways.

In 1918, a 4.5-mile (7.2 km) rail line was built to connect Hog Island with Philadelphia: the 60th Street Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

The first ship, named for the Lenape name for the site, was christened August 5, 1918, by Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. The shipbuilding process practiced on Hog Island was an early experiment in standardized construction of ships. The ships built there, known as &quot;Hog Islanders&quot;, were considered ugly but well-built. In all, 122 Hog Islanders were built, mostly cargo ships, and a few troop transport ships. The shipbuilding continued until 1921, after which the facility was rapidly demolished. None of the ships were ready in time to participate in World War I, but many of them were involved in World War II. Two of the locomotive steam gantry cranes were sold as surplus to the city of Trenton, New Jersey, where they remain today as the Hog Island Cranes, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Another crane, a 20-ton industrial locomotive crane, was sold to the Hyde, McFarlan &amp; Burke contracting company.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers filled in the creek separating Hog Island from the mainland with silt dredged from the shipping channels, making Hog Island part of the mainland.

Air operations began on Hog Island in 1925, when the Pennsylvania Air National Guard used a small part of it as a training field for its pilots. In 1927, the site was dedicated as the &quot;Philadelphia Municipal Airport&quot; by Charles Lindbergh, who flew in on the &quot;Spirit of Saint Louis&quot;. But more than a decade would pass before the airport would become the region&#x27;s main air hub. The city of Philadelphia bought Hog Island from the federal government in 1930 for $3 million but the Great Depression delayed work until 1937. In the meantime, Camden Central Airport, opened in 1929 in New Jersey, served as the city&#x27;s main airport until Philadelphia Municipal Airport opened on June 20, 1940.

==Cultural context==
One legend of the origin of the hoagie sandwich is tied to Hog Island. Domenic Vitiello, professor of Urban Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, asserts that Italians working on Hog Island in the old Navy Yard introduced the sandwich, by putting various meats, cheeses, and lettuce between two slices of bread. This became known as the &quot;Hog Island&quot; sandwich; hence, the &quot;hoagie&quot;.

<text>Edmund Beale Sargant (19 March 1855 – 1 October 1938) was a colonial administrator in the British Empire, particularly notable for his policy of introducing English in the South African educational system in the first years of the twentieth century, as Director of Education for the Transvaal and Orange River Colony under Alfred Milner, and in the aftermath of the Second Boer War. &quot;The Sargant Repor&quot;t (1905) was important for the future of education in the Transvaal.

Sargant was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was made director of education in South Africa in 1897. Sargant founded and funded a shortlived school in Hackney, London, called &#x27;School Field&#x27;. Its purpose was to demonstrate that children could be given a better education if their teachers were not bound by a narrow curriculum and were not required to focus on success in attainment tests in order to ensure school funding.

He was also a poet, appearing in particular in the first of the &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; anthologies.

<text>The University of Mysore is a public state university in Mysore, Karnataka, India. The university was founded during the reign of Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV and the premiership of Sir M. Visvesvaraya. The university is recognised by the University Grants Commission for offering higher studies degree courses on-campus as well as online. It was inaugurated on 27 July 1916. Its first chancellor was the maharaja himself; the first Vice-Chancellor was H. V. Nanjundaiah. This was the first university outside of British administered Indian provinces, the sixth in the Indian subcontinent as a whole, and the first in Karnataka. It is a state university of the affiliating type, and was deemed autonomous within the Republic of India on 3 March 1956, when it gained recognition from the University Grants Commission.

The Mysore University Library comprises over 800,000 books, 2,400 journal titles, and 100,000 volumes of journals. The main campus features an amphitheater, an auditorium, a swimming pool, and hostel accommodations for men and women. As of July 2013, the University of Mysore was accredited &quot;Grade A&quot; by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).

==History==


===Recent academic restructuring===
The International School of Information Management, was created in 2005 through the collaboration of three US universities, as well as Dalhousie University of Canada, and IIIT, Bangalore. Faculty members from these partnering institutions teach at ISiM.

The Third Sector Research Resource Centre (TSRRS) was established in 2004. The aim of the centre is &#x27;...to undertake and promote interdisciplinary [sic] studies and research in the domain of civil society,&#x27; with a secondary aim of developing and offering Diploma and Masters programs in the management of non-profit organisations.

More recently, the Department of Law in the university was incorporated into the Mysore University School of Justice (MUSJ). Continuing with the university&#x27;s initiative to introduce five-year integrated courses to produce professionals with in-depth knowledge, the MUSJ has introduced a program leading to a degree in law, as a bid to enhance the quality of legal education in Karnataka. University of Mysore along with Institute of Astrophysics has signed an MoU to build a planetarium in Mysore.

== Crest and motto ==
The university&#x27;s motto, &quot;Na Hi Jñanena Sadrusham&quot; (Nothing compares with knowledge) is taken from the Bhagavad Gita.

==Ranking==
Mysore University was ranked 54th among universities in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2024 and 86th overall.

== Online programs ==
The university launched several new online degree programs during the COVID pandemic, in an attempt to ensure students completing their school leaving exams in 2020-21 did not lose an academic year due to colleges and universities being in lockdown. Its programs were approved by the University Grants Commission (India) in early 2020 itself, making it one of the first public universities to try an initiative of this nature. The university had started projects in the field of online programs in 2014, partnering with University18 as a platform partner, making it an early adopter of technology in education.

<doc id="1011599" wikidata="Q137107" url="?curid=1011599" title="Chilean rose tarantula">
<text>The Chilean rose tarantula (&quot;Grammostola rosea&quot;), also known as the rose hair tarantula, the Chilean fire tarantula, or the Chilean red-haired tarantula (depending on the color morph), is probably the most common species of tarantula available in American and European pet stores today, due to the large number of wild-caught specimens exported cheaply from their native Chile into the pet trade. The species is also known from Bolivia and Argentina.

&quot;G. rosea&quot; is a common pet of tarantula hobbyists. Females have been known to live as long as 20 years, but due to the limited time they have been available on the market (and hence for extensive study), they may live considerably longer than 20 years. In the past, considerable confusion existed between this species and &quot;Grammostola porteri&quot;, but in 2022 the World Spider Catalog revised the latter as a junior synonym of &quot;Grammostola rosea&quot;.

==Habitat==
The natural habitat of &quot;Grammostola rosea&quot; is the high desert and scrub regions of northern Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina. Spiders live at lower altitudes, ranging between above sea level. Natural habitats of the Chilean rose tarantula have often been disturbed by human activity, industrialization and urbanization, making exact distribution of the species harder to pinpoint. Though habitat-loss is a threat to the species, they are not endangered and have no wildlife conservation status.

The Chilean rose tarantula usually digs small burrows or finds abandoned reptile or rodent burrows to live-in, which they then line with their silk. The burrows are typically straight-down, with only one or two chambers. Males tend to have burrows underneath more vegetation and plant cover, or under stones; female burrows are less secured but are deeper, reaching 40 cm down. The burrows are occupied by only one spider, as this species lives most of its life solitary. In areas of high population densities, burrows are found to be no closer than apart. Females leave the burrow in short distances only for trapping food and potential mates, while males abandon their burrows to look for mates typically between September and March.

==Diet==
This tarantula has a diverse diet, including numerous beetles, caterpillars, crickets, cockroaches, grasshoppers, mealworms, silkworms, waxworms and even small lizards and rodents. When tarantulas are kept as pets, the best food that can be provided for them are crickets, that have been pre-fed (gut-loaded) on fresh vegetables, as this is the best source of hydrated nutrition for the tarantula.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Grammostola rosea&quot; has two mating seasons: September through March and May through July. In order to reach sexual maturity, the spiders must molt several times over the course of three to four years. Throughout their molting, males develop a hook on their front set of legs, called tibial hooks, that act as a way to hold-up and restrain their female partner during mating. Once a male has reached sexual maturity, he will create a sperm web to deposit his sperm and then place it back into his pedipalps before approaching the female. He eventually approaches the female&#x27;s burrow with caution, tapping and vibrating his legs to attract her out of her shelter. At the opportune moment, the male lunges himself forward and using his hooks, holds the female&#x27;s chelicerae, pushing his mate into a vertical position, giving him access to the female&#x27;s epigyne (external genitalia). The male inserts one (or even both left and right) pedipalp into the female&#x27;s epigyne and injects the fertilizing fluid. In the weeks following fertilization, provided that the female does not molt, she will spin a web and lay 50 to 200 eggs. Males will die a few months following reproduction.

== Defense mechanisms ==
&quot;Grammostola rosea&quot; is a venomous spider. However, its main defense mechanism against predators are the urticating hairs located on its abdomen. These hairs are released by the spider brushing them off its back with its leg, which occurs when the spider feels threatened. The urticating hairs disperse into the air, causing irritation and itching when in contact with predator&#x27;s skin or eyes. The urticating hairs also act as sensory structures, helping the spider identify subtle vibrations or changes in pressure. The Chilean Rose Tarantula&#x27;s next line of defense is their venom, which is injected into their prey through their fangs. Though not extremely dangerous to humans, the venom contains neurotoxins that disrupt the nervous system and hemotoxins that disrupt the circulatory system. Venom is mainly used for hunting as it also contains enzymes that break down prey into ingestible fluid.

==As pets==
&quot;Grammostola rosea&quot; is relatively docile, low-maintenance, and inexpensive, so they are popular as pets, kept in terrariums. Given their natural distribution in northern Chile, &quot;G. rosea&quot; can be kept in relatively low humidity. They can be kept at temperatures around , on a diet of crickets or locusts. The spider can fast for weeks to months at a time. Fasting is sometimes an indication of an upcoming ecdysis (moult).

&quot;G. rosea&quot; is usually skittish, running away from danger rather than acting defensively, but it may also raise its front legs and present its fangs in preparation to defend itself. It can act especially defensive for days after moulting; this may be innate in the spider&#x27;s behavior. As with the majority of tarantulas from the Americas, it has small, spine-like urticating hairs on its abdomen that it kicks off or releases when threatened as a defense.

In February 2009, a British man was treated for tarantula hairs lodged in his cornea. The urticating hairs were thrown from the man&#x27;s pet &quot;G. rosea&quot; while he was cleaning its tank. Medical authorities urge owners to wear protective eyewear when handling &quot;G. rosea&quot;. The venom of the Chilean rose tarantula contains multiple toxins, which may help it immobilize and digest prey, as well as deter predators. A specific peptide found in this venom, termed GsMTx4 (Grammostola rosea Mechanotoxin 4) has been shown to inhibit mechanosensitive ion channels in living cells.

<doc id="1011606" wikidata="Q4356416" url="?curid=1011606" title="Tendō-ryū">
<text>, also known as , is a koryū (school of traditional Japanese martial arts) founded in 1582 by Saito Hangan Denkibo Katsuhide. The current headmaster (as of 2020) is the 17th sōke Kimura Yasuko. 

Although Denkibo was already an incredibly talented Samurai, he felt that his technique was still incomplete and went to the Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura to pray for 100 days. In 1581, Denkibo had the revelation he had been longing for and created his school named Ten Ryū (天流), the “School of Heaven”, which later became Tendō Ryū (天道流), the “School of the Way to Heaven”.

Although it is mainly known today for its techniques with the naginata, the Japanese glaive, Tendō-ryū actually includes the practice of various other weapons: the long and short swords, both swords simultaneously, two kinds of daggers, the staff (representing the shaft of a broken naginata), and the Japanese sickle-and-chain (kusarigama).

The modern version of naginata practice, called &quot;new Naginata&quot; (新しいなぎなた &quot;atarashii naginata&quot;), is one of the nine official modern budō recognized by the Nippon Budōkan. Tendō-ryū is one of the two main classical styles of naginatajutsu which &quot;atarashii naginata&quot; is derived from, the other one being Jikishinkage-ryu Naginatajutsu.

<doc id="1011654" wikidata="Q459213" url="?curid=1011654" title="Managerial grid model">
<text>The managerial grid model or managerial grid theory (1964) is a model, developed by Robert R. Blake and Jane Mouton, of leadership styles.

This model originally identified five different leadership styles based on the &quot;concern for people&quot; and the &quot;concern for production&quot;.

The optimal leadership style in this model is based on Theory Y.

The grid theory has continued to evolve and develop. The theory was updated with two additional leadership styles and with a new element, resilience.

In 1999, the grid managerial seminar began using a new text, &quot;The Power to Change&quot;.

The model is represented as a grid with &quot;concern for production&quot; as the x-axis and &quot;concern for people&quot; as the y-axis; each axis ranges from 1 (Low) to 9 (High). The resulting leadership styles are as follows:

* The indifferent (previously called impoverished) style (1,1): evade and elude. In this style, managers have low concern for both people and production. Managers use this style to preserve job and job seniority, protecting themselves by avoiding getting into trouble. The main concern for the manager is not to be held responsible for any mistakes, which results in less innovative decisions.
*The accommodating (previously, country club) style (1,9): yield and comply. This style has a high concern for people and a low concern for production. Managers using this style pay much attention to the security and comfort of the employees, in hopes that this will increase performance. The resulting atmosphere is usually friendly, but not necessarily very productive.
*The dictatorial (previously, produce or perish) style (9,1): in return. Managers using this style pressure their employees through rules and punishments to achieve the company goals. This dictatorial style is based on Theory X of Douglas McGregor, and is commonly applied in companies on the edge of real or perceived failure. This style is often used in cases of crisis management.
* The [[status quo]] (previously, middle-of-the-road) style (5,5): balance and compromise. Managers using this style try to balance between company goals and workers&#x27; needs. By giving some concern to both people and production, managers who use this style hope to achieve suitable performance but doing so gives away a bit of each concern so that neither production nor people needs are met.
* The sound (previously, team) style &quot;(9,9)&quot;: contribute and commit. In this style, high concern is paid both to people and production. As suggested by the propositions of Theory Y, managers choosing to use this style encourage teamwork and commitment among employees. This method relies heavily on making employees feel themselves to be constructive parts of the company.
* The [[opportunism|opportunistic]] style: exploit and manipulate. Individuals using this style, which was added to the grid theory before 1999, do not have a fixed location on the grid. They adopt whichever behaviour offers the greatest personal benefit.
* The [[paternalism|paternalistic]] style: prescribe and guide. This style was added to the grid theory before 1999. In &quot;The Power to Change&quot;, it was redefined to alternate between the (1,9) and (9,1) locations on the grid. Managers using this style praise and support, but discourage challenges to their thinking.

== Behavioral elements ==

Grid theory breaks behavior down into seven key elements:

<text>Nicu Ceaușescu (; 1 September 1951 – 26 September 1996) was a Romanian physicist and communist politician who was the youngest child of Romanian leaders Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu. He was a close associate of his father&#x27;s political regime and considered the President&#x27;s heir presumptive.

==Life during communism==

According to Ion Mihai Pacepa (who defected to the United States in 1978), Ceaușescu wanted Nicu to become his Foreign Minister and for that, he instructed two high-ranked Party members, Ștefan Andrei and Cornel Pacoste (whom he considered brilliant communist intellectuals) to take care of Nicu&#x27;s education; Pacepa further claimed that, unlike his older siblings, he disliked school and was allegedly derided by them for never being seen reading a book.

He graduated from Liceul no. 24 (now named Jean Monnet High School) and then studied physics at the University of Bucharest. He was involved in Uniunea Tineretului Comunist while a student, becoming its First Secretary and then Minister of Youth Issues, being elected to the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party in 1982.

As an apprentice in politics, he was mentored by Ștefan Andrei, Ion Traian Ștefănescu and Cornel Pacoste. Toward the end of the 1980s, he was made a member of the Executive Committee of the Romanian Communist Party and in 1987 the leader for Sibiu County, being prepared by his parents to be his father&#x27;s successor.

==Post-communist life and legacy==
Since high school, Nicu was reputed to be a heavy drinker. Pacepa alleged that Nicu scandalized Bucharest with his rapes and car accidents. He claimed that his father heard about Nicu&#x27;s drinking problem, but his solution was to work harder. He also allegedly lost large sums of money gambling around the world. former body double of Uday Hussein, son of Iraqi President claimed that Nicu was good friends with Uday, and the two would visit each other in Switzerland and Monaco.

The documentary &quot;Videograms of a Revolution&quot; shows him exhibited as a prisoner on state television on 22 December 1989 after being arrested on accusations of holding children as hostages and other crimes. He was also arrested in 1990 for misuse of government funds under his father&#x27;s regime, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Released in November 1992 because of cirrhosis, he died of the disease four years later, aged 45, in a Vienna hospital.

<doc id="1011677" wikidata="Q6987851" url="?curid=1011677" title="Nehi">
<text>Nehi ( ) is a flavored soft drink that originated in the United States. It was introduced in 1924 by Chero-Cola/Union Bottle Works and founded by Claud A. Hatcher, a Columbus, Georgia, grocer who began bottling ginger ale and root beer in 1905.

The &quot;Nehi Corporation&quot; name was adopted in 1928 after the Nehi fruit-flavored sodas became popular. In 1955, the company changed its name to Royal Crown Company, after the success of its RC Cola brand. In April 2008, Nehi became a brand of Dr Pepper Snapple Group (now known as Keurig Dr Pepper) in the United States.

==History==
The Chero-Cola company added Nehi Cola to its line of sodas in 1924 in order to offer a broader variety of flavors. The soda was a creation of businessman Claud A. Hatcher. The name &quot;Nehi&quot; was to remind customers that it came in &quot;knee-high&quot; tall bottles. It offered orange, grape, root beer, peach, and other flavors of soda. Nehi was instantly successful and outsold Chero-Cola entirely.

The company changed its name to the Nehi Corporation in 1928 and was listed on the New York Curb Exchange. Business went well until 1930 when a major crisis occurred. Reflecting the Great Depression, which followed the stock market crash of October 1929, the Nehi Corporation&#x27;s sales figures dropped by $1 million in 1930 from a high of $3.7 million in the previous year. Sales continued to decline until 1932, the only year in which the company ever lost money.

By 1933, the low point was past, and the business was just beginning to stabilize when another tragedy struck. Claud A. Hatcher, the company&#x27;s president and guiding light from its formation, died suddenly December 31, 1933. Hatcher was soon replaced by H. R. Mott, vice president of the Nehi Corporation for several years beforehand, who had been associated with the company since 1920. As the new president, he was greeted with a great amount of debt. His all-consuming ambition, however, was to make the company debt-free as quickly as possible and to keep it that way. He updated operations, obtained extensions of credit, and cut expenses. Within a year, the Nehi Corporation was debt-free and ready to move ahead once more.

=== Advertising ===
In the early 20th century, the national advertising logo of Nehi was typically a picture of a seated woman&#x27;s legs, in which the skirt was high enough to show the stockings up to the knee, suggesting the phrase &quot;knee-high&quot;, to illustrate the correct pronunciation of the company name. This logo was seen in the film &quot;Paper Moon&quot; in a diner where Moses Pray buys Addie Loggins a Nehi. A more provocative, Midwestern version of the logo—one showing a single, thigh-high disembodied leg without a skirt—was referenced in Jean Shepherd&#x27;s story &quot;My Old Man and the Lascivious Special Award That Heralded the Birth of Pop Art&quot; in the book &quot;In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash&quot;, as well as in the film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, which was adapted from several short stories in the book. Shepherd&#x27;s invention of the now-famous &quot;Leg Lamp&quot; in his stories of the Depression era was derived from the Midwestern Nehi logo.

Robert Ripley advertised Nehi on his radio show &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; The radio show was successful in promoting the new RC Cola brand and, by 1940, the company was doing well financially. In 1946, the pace for the corporation accelerated tremendously. The company began to enhance its advertising by using celebrities. Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford (before joining the Pepsi Cola Company board of directors), Bob Hope, and many others joined in selling the products of the Nehi Corporation. When World War II was over, the company and its bottlers joined in a progressive program of expansion and improvement that made 1947 one of its best years. In that year, Hedy Lamarr was pictured in point-of-purchase advertising signs. At that time, the Nehi Corporation offered more than 10 flavors and those included Dr. Nehi, Nehi Chocolate, Nehi Root Beer, Nehi Lemonade, Nehi Wild Red, Nehi Blue Cream, and its more classic flavors Nehi Orange, Nehi Grape, and Nehi Peach. Many of these flavors were later dropped as their novelty and popularity waned. A fictional illustration of the popularity of the drink in this era is seen in the character Cpl. Walter &quot;Radar&quot; O&#x27;Reilly, the company clerk on the long-running television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, set during the Korean War; Radar&#x27;s favorite beverage was Grape Nehi.

<text>Transferred intent (or transferred, or transferred malice, in English law) is a legal doctrine that holds that, when the intention to harm one individual inadvertently causes a second person to be hurt instead, the perpetrator is still held responsible. To be held legally responsible, a court typically must demonstrate that the perpetrator had criminal intent (), that is, that they knew or should have known that another would be harmed by their actions and wanted this harm to occur. For example, if a murderer intends to kill John, but accidentally kills George instead, the intent is transferred from John to George, and the killer is held to have had criminal intent.

Transferred intent also applies to tort law, in which there are generally five areas where transferred intent is applicable: battery, assault, false imprisonment, trespass to land, and trespass to chattels. Generally, any &quot;intent&quot; to cause any one of these five torts which results in the completion of any of the five tortious acts will be considered an intentional act, even if the actual target of the tort is one other than the intended target of the original tort.

See cases of &quot;Carnes v. Thompson&quot;, 48 S.W.2d 903 (Mo. 1932) and &quot;Bunyan v. Jordan&quot; (1937), 57 C.L.R. 1, 37 S.R.N.S.W. 119 for examples.
==Discussion==

=== In the United States ===
In United States criminal law, transferred intent is sometimes explained by stating that &quot;the intent follows the bullet&quot;. That is, the intent to kill a person by gunshot would still apply even if the bullet kills an unintended victim (&quot;see mens rea&quot;).

In Ohio law, the doctrine of transferred intent was held to be valid in &quot;Bradshaw v. Richey&quot;. It cited the 1988 decision in &quot;State v. Sowell&quot;, which said &quot;if one purposely causes the death of another and the death is the result of a scheme designed to implement the calculated decision to kill someone other than the victim, the offender is guilty of aggravated murder&quot;, and concluded that the doctrine was &quot;firmly rooted&quot; in Ohio precedent dating to at least 1874.

A 1960s-era proposal, the Model Penal Code, invited states to adopt a standard where an element of a crime could be established, even though:
*The offender caused the intended harm, but to a different person or item than the one they intended; or
*The offender caused &quot;the same kind of injury or harm&quot; as intended, in a manner that was &quot;not too remote or accidental in its occurrence&quot;.

=== In the United Kingdom ===
In the UK the transferred malice doctrine is not without controversy. The House of Lords in &quot;Attorney General&#x27;s Reference No 3 of 1994&quot; reversed the Court of Appeal decision (reported at (1996) 2 WLR 412), holding that the doctrine of transferred malice could not apply to convict an accused of murder when the defendant had stabbed a pregnant woman in the face, back and abdomen. Some days after she was released from hospital in an apparently stable condition, she went into labour and gave birth to a premature child, who died four months later. The child had been wounded in the original attack but the more substantial cause of death was her prematurity. It was argued that the fetus was part of the mother so that any intention to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) to the mother was also an intent aimed at the fetus. Lord Mustill criticised the doctrine as having no sound intellectual basis, saying that it was related to the original concept of malice, i.e. that a wrongful act displayed a malevolence which could be attached to any adverse consequence, and this had long been out of date. Nevertheless, it would sometimes provide a justification to convict when that was a common sense outcome and so could sensibly be retained. The present case was not a simple &quot;transfer&quot; from mother to uterine child, but sought to create an intention to cause injury to the child after birth. This would be a double transfer: first from the mother to the fetus, and then from the fetus to the child when it was born. Then one would have to apply the fiction which converts an intention to commit GBH into the &quot;mens rea&quot; of murder. That was too much. But the accused could be convicted of manslaughter.

In &quot;R v Gnango&quot;, the Supreme Court controversially held that under the doctrines of joint enterprise and transferred malice D2 is guilty of V&#x27;s murder if D1 and D2 voluntarily engage in fighting each other, each intending to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the other and each foreseeing that the other has the reciprocal intention, and if D1 mistakenly kills V in the course of the fight.

<text>Workerism is a political theory that emphasizes the importance of or glorifies the working class. Workerism, or , was of particular significance in Italian left-wing politics, being largely embraced in Italian political groups ranging from Italian communists to Italian anarchists.

== As revolutionary praxis ==
Workerism (or ) is a political analysis, whose main elements were to merge into autonomism, that starts out from the power of the working class. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, known as operaist and autonomist writers, offer a definition of , quoting from Karl Marx as they do so:

: builds on Marx&#x27;s claim that capital reacts to the struggles of the working class; the working class is active and capital reactive. 

:Technological development: Where there are strikes, machines will follow. &quot;It would be possible to write a whole history of the inventions made since 1830 for the sole purpose of providing capital with weapons against working-class revolt.&quot; (&quot;Capital&quot;, Vol. 1, Chapter 15, Section 5)

:Political development: The factory legislation in England was a response to the working class struggle over the length of the working day. &quot;Their formulation, official recognition and proclamation by the State were the result of a long class struggle.&quot; (&quot;Capital&quot;, Vol. 1, Chapter 10, Section 6)

: takes this as its fundamental axiom: the struggles of the working class &quot;precede&quot; and &quot;prefigure&quot; the successive re-structurations of capital.

The workerists followed Marx in seeking to base their politics on an investigation of working class life and struggle. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, they drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the Johnson–Forest Tendency and in France by the group Socialisme ou Barbarie. The Johnson–Forest Tendency had studied working class life and struggles within the Detroit auto industry, publishing pamphlets such as &quot;The American Worker&quot; (1947), &quot;Punching Out&quot; (1952) and &quot;Union Committeemen and Wildcat Strikes&quot; (1955). That work was translated into French by Socialisme ou Barbarie and published, serially, in their journal. They too began investigating and writing about what was going on inside workplaces, in their case inside both auto factories and insurance offices.

The journal (&quot;Red Notebooks&quot;, 1961–5), along with its successor (&quot;Working Class&quot;, 1963–6), both founded by Negri and Tronti, developed workerist theory, focusing on the struggles of proletarians.

Associated with this theoretical development was a praxis based on workplace organising, most notably by Lotta Continua. This reached its peak in the Italian &quot;Hot Autumn&quot; of 1969.

By the mid-1970s, however, the emphasis shifted from the factory to &quot;the social factory&quot;—the everyday lives of working people in their communities. The &quot;operaist&quot; and &quot;post-operaist&quot; movement was increasingly known as the autonomist movement.

<text>The Combretaceae, often called the white mangrove family, are a family of flowering plants in the order Myrtales. The family includes about 530 species of trees, shrubs, and lianas in ca 10 genera. The family includes the leadwood tree, &quot;Combretum imberbe&quot;. Three genera, &quot;Conocarpus&quot;, &quot;Laguncularia&quot;, and &quot;Lumnitzera&quot;, grow in mangrove habitats (mangals). The Combretaceae are widespread in the subtropics and tropics. Some members of this family produce useful construction timber, such as idigbo from &quot;Terminalia ivorensis&quot;. The commonly cultivated &quot;Quisqualis indica&quot; (as well as the entire former genus &quot;Quisqualis&quot;) is now placed in the genus &quot;Combretum&quot;. Many plants in the former &quot;Quisqualis&quot; genus contain the excitotoxin quisqualic acid, a potent AMPA agonist.

==White mangroves==
The family name comes from the type genus &quot;Combretum&quot;; it also includes the white mangrove, &quot;Laguncularia racemosa&quot;, found along seacoasts in tropical America and West Africa.

<text>Combretum, the bushwillows or combretums, make up the type genus of the family Combretaceae. The genus comprises about 272 species of trees and shrubs, most of which are native to tropical and southern Africa, about 5 to Madagascar, but there are others that are native to tropical Asia, New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, Australia, and tropical America. Though somewhat reminiscent of willows (&quot;Salix&quot;) in their habitus, they are not particularly close relatives of these.

==Ecology==

Bushwillow trees often are important plants in their habitat. Savannahs in Africa, in particular those growing on granitic soils, are often dominated by &quot;Combretum&quot; and its close relative &quot;Terminalia&quot;. For example, &quot;C. apiculatum&quot; is a notable tree in the Angolan mopane woodlands ecoregion in the Kunene River basin in southern Africa.

Other species of this genus are a major component of Southwestern Amazonian moist forests. This genus contains several species that are pollinated by mammals other than bats, which is quite rare indeed. But most species are more conventionally pollinated by insects or birds.

&quot;Typhlodromus combretum&quot;, a mite of the family Phytoseiidae, was discovered on a bushwillow plant and is named after this genus. Other herbivores that eat &quot;Combretum&quot; foliage include the caterpillars of the Brown Awl (&quot;Badamia exclamationis&quot;) which is found on &quot;C. albidum, C. latifolium&quot; and &quot;C. ovalifolium&quot;; those of the Orange-tailed Awl (&quot;Bibasis sena&quot;) are recorded from &quot;C. extensum&quot; and &quot;C. latifolium&quot;.

==Use by humans==

Several species are used in African or Indian herbal medicine. Several species of this genus in Madagascar known collectively as &quot;voantamenaka&quot; or &quot;voatamenaka&quot; (from &quot;voa&quot; &#x27;fruit&#x27; and &quot;menaka&quot; &#x27;oil&#x27;) are used in traditional Malagasy medicine as deworming remedies. The class of chemical compounds known as combretastatins were first isolated from South African bushwillow (&quot;Combretum afrum&quot;), from which they get their name. One synthetic derivative, fosbretabulin disodium (combretastatin A4 phosphate), underwent preliminary study for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer, but it was not effective enough to progress to more advanced trials. &quot;C. molle&quot; is also recorded to contain antioxidants such as punicalagin, which is also found in pomegranates (&quot;Punica granatum&quot;), a somewhat related plant.

The botanist George Don studied this genus extensively. The Luvuvhu River in southern Africa was named after the river&#x27;s bushwillows (&quot;C. erythrophyllum&quot;), locally known as &quot;muvuvhu&quot;.

<doc id="1011736" wikidata="Q2639023" url="?curid=1011736" title="Savoyan League">
<text>The Savoyan League (, ) was a regionalist and populist political party based in Savoy, France.

Founded in 1995, the party supported the independence of Savoy from France and the unification of the two departments of Savoy, named Savoie and Haute-Savoie, which have belonged to France since the Treaty of Turin in 1860. Formerly a member of the European Free Alliance, the party was generally pro-European in outlook, while lying on the right of the political spectrum. The League co-operated with the Savoy Region Movement, which does not support independence but rather federalism and Savoyard autonomism.

In the 1998 regional elections, the League won 5.39% in Savoy (4.42% in Savoie and 6.05% in Haute-Savoie) and therefore won a seat in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council. It did not participate in the 2004 regional elections.

At the party&#x27;s 17th Congress on 21 October 2012, the Savoyan League suspended its activities.

<text>The Savoy Region Movement (, ) is a French regionalist political party based in Savoy.

The party supports the creation of a Savoyard region composed of the departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie. Both of these departments are part of the larger Rhône-Alpes region, an &#x27;artificial&#x27; region built in 1972. It also supports Arpitan (or Franco-Provençal), the older language of this region.

The party is a member of the &quot;Fédération Régions et Peuples Solidaires&quot; and the European Free Alliance, and it has had only one of its members elected to the regional council since 1992.

<doc id="1011776" wikidata="Q192375" url="?curid=1011776" title="Hangar">
<text>A hangar is a building or structure designed to hold aircraft or spacecraft. Hangars are built of metal, wood, or concrete. The word &quot;hangar&quot; comes from Middle French &quot;hanghart&quot; (&quot;enclosure near a house&quot;), of Germanic origin, from Frankish *&quot;haimgard&quot; (&quot;home-enclosure&quot;, &quot;fence around a group of houses&quot;), from *&quot;haim&quot; (&quot;home, village, hamlet&quot;) and &quot;gard&quot; (&quot;yard&quot;). The term, &quot;gard&quot;, comes from the Old Norse &quot;garðr&quot; (&quot;enclosure, garden&quot;).

Hangars are used for protection from the weather, direct sunlight and for maintenance, repair, manufacture, assembly and storage of aircraft.

==History==
The Wright brothers stored and repaired their aircraft in a wooden hangar constructed in 1902 at Kill Devil Hills in North Carolina for their glider. After completing design and construction of the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; in Ohio, the brothers returned to Kill Devil Hills only to find their hangar damaged. They repaired the structure and constructed a new workshop while they waited for the &quot;Flyer&quot; to be shipped.
Carl Richard Nyberg used a hangar to store his 1908 &quot;Flugan&quot; (fly) in the early 20th century and in 1909, Louis Bleriot crash-landed on a northern French farm in Les Baraques (between Sangatte and Calais) and rolled his monoplane into the farmer&#x27;s cattle pen. Bleriot was in a race to be the first man to cross the English Channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft, and he and set up his headquarters in the unused shed. In Britain, the earliest aircraft hangars were known as aeroplane sheds, and the oldest survivors of these are at Larkhill, Wiltshire. These were built in 1910 for the Bristol School of Flying and are now Grade II* Listed buildings. British aviation pioneer Alliott Verdon Roe built one of the first aeroplane sheds in 1907 at Brooklands, Surrey and full-size replicas of this and the 1908 Roe biplane are on display at Brooklands Museum.

As aviation became established in Britain before World War I, standard designs of hangar gradually appeared with military types too such as the Bessonneau hangar and the side-opening aeroplane shed of 1913, both of which were soon adopted by the Royal Flying Corps. Examples of the latter survive at Farnborough, Filton and Montrose airfields. During World War I, other standard designs included the RFC General Service Flight Shed and the Admiralty F-Type of 1916, the General Service Shed (featuring the characteristic Belfast-truss roof and built-in various sizes) and the Handley Page aeroplane shed (1918).

==Construction==
===Steel construction===
Sheds built for rigid airships survive at Moffett Field, California; Akron, Ohio; Weeksville, North Carolina; Lakehurst, New Jersey; Santa Cruz Air Force Base in Brazil; 
and Cardington, Bedfordshire. Steel rigid airship hangars are some of the largest in the world.

Hangar 1, Lakehurst, is located at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst (formerly Naval Air Station Lakehurst), New Jersey. The structure was completed in 1921 and is typical of airship hangar designs of World War I. The site is best known for the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster, when on May 6, 1937, the German airship &quot;Hindenburg&quot; crashed and burned while landing. Hangar No.1 at Lakehurst was used to build and store the American USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. The hangar also provided service and storage for the airships USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;Akron&quot;, &quot;Macon&quot;, as well as the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; and the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;.

The largest hangars ever built include the Goodyear Airdock measuring 1,175x325x211 feet and Hangar One (Mountain View, California) measuring . The Goodyear Airdock, is in Akron, Ohio and the structure was completed on November 25, 1929. The Airdock was used for the construction of the USS &quot;Akron&quot; and her sister ship, the USS &quot;Macon&quot;.

Hangar One at Moffett Federal Field (formerly Naval Air Station Moffett Field), is located in Mountain View, California. The structure was completed in 1931. It housed the USS &quot;Macon&quot;.

===Wood construction===
The U.S. Navy established more airship operations during WWII. As part of this, ten &quot;lighter-than-air&quot; (LTA) bases across the United States were built as part of the coastal defence plan; a total of 17 hangars were built. Hangars at these bases are some of the world&#x27;s largest freestanding timber structures. Bases with wooden hangars included: the Naval Air Stations at South Weymouth, Massachusetts (1 hangar); Lakehurst, New Jersey (2); Weeksville, North Carolina (1); Glynco, Georgia (2); Richmond, Florida (3); Houma, Louisiana (1); Hitchcock, Texas (1); Tustin (Santa Ana), California (2); Moffett Field, California (2) and Tillamook, Oregon (2). Of the seventeen, only seven remain, Moffett Federal Field, (former NAS Moffett Field), California (2); former Tustin, California (former NAS Santa Ana and MCAS Tustin), California (2); Tillamook Air Museum/Tillamook Airport (former NAS Tillamook), Oregon (1) and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst/Naval Support Activity Lakehurst (former NAS Lakehurst), New Jersey (2).

===Fabric construction===

A hangar for Cargolifter was built at Brand-Briesen Airfield long, wide and high and is a free standing steel-dome &quot;barrel-bowl&quot; construction large enough to fit the Eiffel Tower on its side. The company went into insolvency and in June 2003, the facilities were sold off and the airship hangar was converted to a &#x27;tropical paradise&#x27;-themed indoor holiday resort called Tropical Islands, which opened in 2004.

An alternative to the fixed hangar is a portable shelter that can be used for aircraft storage and maintenance. Portable fabric structures can be built up to wide, high and any length. They are able to accommodate several aircraft and can be increased in size and even relocated when necessary.

== Structures and sizes ==
Hangars need special structures to be built. The width of the doors have to be large; this includes the aircraft entrance.
The bigger the aircraft to be introduced, the more complex a structure is needed. According to the span of the hangar, sizes can be classified thus:
XXL hangars are built for the largest aircraft in the world like the Airbus A380, Boeing 747 and the Antonov 225, which are the most complex to erect.

==Regulation==
Hangars are usually regulated by the building codes in the countries and jurisdictions and airports where they reside. In August 2014, the American FAA proposed legislation of how a hangar can be used on airfields that receive government funding. The definition of allowed activities included final assembly of aircraft.

==Examples==
===Airship hangars===
Airship hangars or airship sheds are generally larger than conventional aircraft hangars, particularly in height. Most early airships used hydrogen gas to provide them with sufficient buoyancy for flight, so their hangars had to provide protection from stray sparks to keep the gas from exploding. Hangars that held several airships were at risk from chain-reaction explosions. For this reason, most hangars for hydrogen-based airships were built to house only one or two such craft. During the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of airship travel from 1900, mooring masts and sheds were constructed to build and house airships. The British government built a shed in Karachi for the R101, the Brazilian government built one in Rio de Janeiro, the for the German Zeppelins, and the U.S. government constructed Moffett Field, Mountain View, California and Lakehurst Naval Air Station, Lakehurst, New Jersey.

===Hangars aboard ships===

Many warships carry aircraft and will often have hangars for storage and maintenance. Such hangars may be situated adjacent to the flight deck on cruisers, destroyers and frigates or underneath the flight deck with elevators to lift the aircraft on aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. On some vessels where space is short the hangar and flight deck share the same space, with the hangar stowing away for flight operations.

===Hangar homes===

A hangar home is a residence that includes a hangar attached or integrated into the house, where the owner is able to park their privately owned aircraft. Hangar Homes are usually found in residential airparks.

<text>Abdelghani Mzoudi (; ; born 6 December 1972, in Marrakech, Morocco), also transliterated as Abdul Ghani Mzoudi, is an alleged member of al-Qaeda and an associate of Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the September 11 attacks who also served as the hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11.

==Life==
In 1999, Mzoudi lived in the Hamburg cell, an apartment owned by Atta, where many of the organizers of the September 11 attacks met and planned their future. His specific role in the attacks has not been determined, but he does not seem to have attempted to enter the United States at any time.

Mzoudi was captured and tried in Germany, along with Mounir el-Motassadeq, on charges relating to the 9/11 attacks. In their trials, both claimed Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a key planner of the attacks, would have given statements indicating their innocence. Both asked for the United States to present bin al-Shibh as a witness, and the judge agreed that this was a reasonable request. Although the German Justice Ministry pressed the U.S. to present bin al-Shibh, the United States refused, and Mzoudi was thereby acquitted in February 2004. Some observers believe that he would have been convicted had bin al-Shibh been made available as a witness. Ziad Jarrah&#x27;s fiancée Aysel Sengün testified at Mzoudi&#x27;s trial.

In June 2005, a German federal appeals court upheld the acquittal due to insufficient evidence for retrial. The German Interior Ministry was seeking to deport Mzoudi, though the defense team was considering asking for asylum.

Mzoudi was finally deported to Morocco where he now lives as a free man.

<doc id="1011810" wikidata="Q4080276" url="?curid=1011810" title="The Ebony Tower">
<text>The Ebony Tower (1974) by John Fowles is a collection of five novellas and short stories with interlacing themes: &quot;The Ebony Tower,&quot; &quot;Eliduc&quot;, &quot;Poor Koko&quot;, &quot;The Enigma&quot; and &quot;The Cloud&quot;.

==Plot synopses==

===&quot;The Ebony Tower&quot;===

Henry Breasley is an elderly painter whose secluded retirement is invaded by a brash young artist commissioned to write a biographical study of the great man. Breasley shares his home with two young English girls, both former art students, Diana and Anne. In this strange ménage, David is left in no doubt about his host&#x27;s views on modern abstract art. However, he is puzzled by the old man&#x27;s relationship with the girls, especially when he himself is attracted to Diana.

===&quot;Eliduc&quot;===

Eliduc, the shortest tale in the book, is a translation of a Breton lai by Marie de France, in which a hero goes into exile in England, leaving his wife behind. While in exile, he falls for the daughter of a local king. The story is deliberately placed after &quot;The Ebony Tower&quot; as a clear parallel of and influence on the title story.

===&quot;Poor Koko&quot;===

An elderly writer has borrowed a country cottage from friends in London. On the first night of his stay, the house is burgled. &quot;Poor Koko&quot; tells of his encounter with the burglar.

===&quot;The Enigma&quot;===

John Fielding, British Member of Parliament, disappears without trace. Was foul play involved, or did he fake his own disappearance? The case presents few clues for the police officer in charge.

===&quot;The Cloud&quot;===

A seemingly idyllic picnic in the south of France for a group of English family and friends hides deeper, troubled undercurrents.

<doc id="1011811" wikidata="Q312452" url="?curid=1011811" title="Philetaerus">
<text>Philetaerus (; , &quot;Philétairos&quot;, c. 343 –263 BC) was the founder of the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon in Anatolia.

== Early life and career under Lysimachus ==
Philetaerus was born in Tieium (Greek: &quot;Tieion&quot;), a small town on the Black Sea coast in Anatolia. His father Attalus (Greek: &quot;Attalos&quot;) was Greek and his mother Boa was from Paphlagonia.

After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Philetaerus became involved in the Wars of the Diadochi among Alexander&#x27;s regional governors, Antigonus in Phrygia, Lysimachus in Thrace, and Seleucus in Babylonia (among others). Philetaerus first served under Antigonus. He then shifted his allegiance to Lysimachus, who, after Antigonus was killed at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, made Philetaerus commander of Pergamon, where Lysimachus kept a treasury of nine thousand talents of silver.

== Ruler of Pergamon ==

Philetaerus served Lysimachus until 282 BC, when, perhaps because of conflicts involving the court intrigues of Arsinoë, Lysimachus&#x27; third wife, Philetaerus deserted Lysimachus, offering himself and the important fortress of Pergamon, along with its treasury, to Seleucus, who subsequently defeated and killed Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC. Seleucus himself was killed by Ptolemy Ceraunus, a brother of Arsinoë at Lysimachia a few months later.

Though nominally under Seleucid control, Philetaerus, especially after the death of Seleucus, had considerable autonomy and was able with the help of his considerable wealth to increase his power and influence beyond Pergamon. There are numerous records of Philetaerus as benefactor to neighboring cities and temples, including the temples at Delphi and Delos. He also contributed troops, money and food to the city of Cyzicus for defense against the invading Gauls. As a result, Philetaerus gained prestige and goodwill for himself and his family.

During his nearly forty year rule, he constructed the temple of Demeter on the acropolis of Pergamon, and the temple of Athena (Pergamon&#x27;s patron deity), and Pergamon&#x27;s first palace, and he added considerably to the city&#x27;s fortifications.

Philetaerus was a eunuch, though scholars differ on the reason for his castration. Attalus I, the first Attalid king of Pergamon, explained that when Philetaerus was a baby, he was brought into a crowd where he was pressed upon and his testicles were crushed.
:&quot;Philetaerus of Tieium, was a eunuch from boyhood; for it came to pass at a certain burial, when a spectacle was being given at which many people were present, that the nurse who was carrying Philetaerus, still an infant, was caught in the crowd and pressed so hard that the child was incapacitated. He was a eunuch, therefore, but he was well trained and proved worthy of this trust.&quot;

Philetaerus never married and, since he was a eunuch, had no children. He adopted his nephew Eumenes I (the son of Philetaerus&#x27; brother also named Eumenes), who succeeded him as ruler of Pergamon, upon his death in 263 BC.
With the exception of Eumenes II, all future Attalid rulers depicted the bust of Philetaerus on their coins, paying tribute to the founder of their dynasty.

<doc id="1011843" wikidata="Q1252715" url="?curid=1011843" title="Doune Castle">
<text>Doune Castle is a medieval stronghold near the village of Doune, in the Stirling council area of central Scotland and the historic county of Perthshire. The castle is sited on a wooded bend where the Ardoch Burn flows into the River Teith. It lies northwest of Stirling, where the Teith flows into the River Forth. Upstream, further northwest, the town of Callander lies at the edge of the Trossachs, on the fringe of the Scottish Highlands.

Recent research has shown that Doune Castle was originally built in the thirteenth century, then probably damaged in the Scottish Wars of Independence, before being rebuilt in its present form in the late 14th century by Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany (–1420), the son of Robert II of Scotland, and Regent of Scotland from 1388 until his death. Duke Robert&#x27;s stronghold has survived relatively unchanged and complete, and the whole castle was traditionally thought of as the result of a single period of construction at this time. The castle passed to the crown in 1425, when Albany&#x27;s son was executed, and was used as a royal hunting lodge and dower house. In the later 16th century, Doune became the property of the Earls of Moray. The castle saw military action during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Glencairn&#x27;s rising in the mid-17th century, and during the Jacobite risings of the late 17th century and 18th century. By 1800 the castle was ruined, but restoration works were carried out in the 1880s, prior to its passing into state care in the 20th century. It is now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland.

Due to the status of its builder, Doune reflected current ideas of what a royal castle building should be. It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing the rooms of the Lord and his family, and a separate tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms. The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century, with only minor repairs carried out in the 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.

== History ==

The site at the confluence of the Ardoch Burn and the River Teith had been fortified by the Romans in the 1st century AD, although no remains are visible above ground. Ramparts and ditches to the south of the present castle may be the site of an earlier fortification, as the name Doune, derived from Gaelic &quot;dùn&quot;, meaning &quot;fort&quot;, suggests. The earliest identifiable work in the castle dates from the thirteenth century, but it assumed its present form during one of the most creative and productive periods of Scottish medieval architecture, between 1375 and 1425, when numerous castles were being built and remodelled, including Dirleton and Tantallon in Lothian, and Bothwell in Lanarkshire.

=== Regent Albany ===

In 1361, Robert Stewart (–1420), son of King Robert II (reigned 1371–1390), and brother of King Robert III (reigned 1390–1406), was created Earl of Menteith, and was granted the lands on which Doune Castle now stands. Building may have started any time after this, and the castle was at least partially complete in 1381, when a charter was sealed here. Robert was appointed Regent in 1388 for his elderly father, and continued to hold effective power during the reign of his infirm brother. He was created Duke of Albany in 1398. In 1406, Robert III&#x27;s successor, James I, was captured by the English, and Albany became Regent once more. After this time, the number of charters issued at Doune suggest that the castle became a favoured residence.

=== Royal retreat ===

Albany died in 1420, and Doune, the dukedom of Albany, and the Regency all passed to his son Murdoch (1362–1425). The ransom for James I was finally paid to the English, and the King returned in 1424, taking immediate steps to gain control of his kingdom. Albany and two of his sons were imprisoned for treason, and then executed in May 1425. Doune Castle became a royal possession, under an appointed Captain, or Keeper, and served as a retreat and hunting lodge for the Scottish monarchs. It was also used as a dower house by Mary of Guelders (–1463), Margaret of Denmark (1456–1486), and Margaret Tudor (1489–1541), the widowed consorts of James II, James III and James IV respectively.

In March 1500, before his marriage to Margaret Tudor, James IV gave the keeping of Doune Castle and extensive lands in Menteith to his mistress Janet Kennedy, in consideration of the &quot;hartlie luve and invict favoris he has and beris to her&quot;.

In 1528, Margaret Tudor, now Regent of Scotland for her infant son James V, married Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, a descendant of Albany. His brother, Sir James Stewart (–1554), was made Captain of Doune Castle, and Sir James&#x27; son, also James (–1590), was created Lord Doune in 1570. Lord Doune&#x27;s son, another James (–1592), married Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of Moray around 1580, becoming Earl of Moray himself. The castle thus came to be the seat of its keepers, the Earls of Moray, who owned it until the 20th century.

Mary, Queen of Scots, (reigned 1542–1567) stayed at Doune on several occasions, occupying the suite of rooms above the kitchen. Doune was held by forces loyal to Mary during the brief civil war which followed her forced abdication in 1567, but the garrison surrendered to the Regent, Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, in 1570, after a three-day blockade. George Buchanan and Duncan Nairn, Deputy Sheriff of Stirling presided over the torture and interrogation of a messenger, John Moon, at Doune on 4 October 1570. Moon was carrying letters to Mary, Queen of Scots and Mary Seton.

King James VI visited Doune on occasion, and in 1581 authorised £300 to be spent on repairs and improvements, the works being carried out by the master mason Michael Ewing under the supervision of Robert Drummond of Carnock, Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland. In 1593, a plot against James was discovered, and the King surprised the conspirators, who included John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose and John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie, at Doune Castle.

=== Prison and garrison ===
In 1607, the minister, John Munro of Tain, a dissenter against the religious plans of James VI, was imprisoned with a fellow minister at Doune, though he escaped with the contrivance of the then Constable of the Castle, who was subsequently imprisoned for aiding the dissenters. The Royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose occupied Doune Castle in 1645, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In 1654, during Glencairn&#x27;s rising against the occupation of Scotland by Oliver Cromwell, a skirmish took place at Doune between Royalists under Sir Mungo Murray, and Cromwellian troops under Major Tobias Bridge. The castle was garrisoned by government troops during the Jacobite rising of 1689 of Bonnie Dundee, when repairs were ordered, and again during the rising of 1715. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Doune Castle was occupied by Bonnie Prince Charlie and his Jacobite Highlanders. It was used as a prison for government troops captured at the Battle of Falkirk. Several prisoners, held in the rooms above the kitchen, escaped by knotting together bedsheets and climbing from the window. Escapees included the author John Home, and a minister, John Witherspoon, who later moved to the American colonies and became a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence.

=== Ruin and restoration ===

The castle deteriorated through the 18th century, and by 1800 Doune was a roofless ruin. It remained so until the 1880s, when George Stuart, 14th Earl of Moray (1816–1895) began repair works. The timber roofs were replaced, and the interiors, including the panelling in the Lord&#x27;s Hall, were installed. The castle is now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland, having been donated to a predecessor organisation by Douglas Stuart, 20th Earl of Moray, in 1984, and is open to the public. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

== Description ==

Doune occupies a strategic site, close to the geographical centre of Scotland, and only from Stirling Castle, the &quot;crossroads of Scotland&quot;. The site is naturally defended on three sides by steeply-sloping ground, and by the two rivers to east and west. The castle forms an irregular pentagon in plan, with buildings along the north and north-west sides enclosing a courtyard. It is entered from the north via a passage beneath a tower containing the principal rooms of the castle. From the courtyard, three sets of stone external stairs, which may be later additions, lead up to the Lord&#x27;s Hall in the tower, to the adjacent Great Hall, and to the kitchens in a second tower to the west.

The main approach, from the north, is defended by earthworks, comprising three ditches, with a rampart, or earthen wall, between. Also outside the castle walls is a vaulted passage, traditionally said to lead into the castle, but in fact accessing an 18th-century ice house. There are no openings within the lower part of the castle&#x27;s walls, excepting the entrance and the postern, or side gate, to the west, although there are relatively large windows on the upper storeys. Windows in the south wall suggest that further buildings were intended within the courtyard, but were never built. The stonework is of coursed sandstone rubble, with dressings in lighter Ballengeich stone.

=== The Lord&#x27;s tower ===
The principal tower, or gatehouse, is rectangular in plan by , and almost high, with a projecting round tower on the north-east corner, beside the entrance. It comprises the Lord&#x27;s Hall, and three storeys of chambers above, located over the entrance passage. The vaulted, cobbled passage, long, was formerly defended by two sets of timber doors, and a yett, or hinged iron grille, remains. Guardrooms on either side overlook the passage via gunloops, and also on the ground floor is a well, in the basement of the round tower.
There is no direct communication between the ground floor and the Lord&#x27;s Hall above, which occupies the whole first floor. This is accessed via an enclosed and gated stair from the courtyard. The hall is vaulted, and has an unusual double fireplace. The floor tiles, timber panelling, and minstrels&#x27; gallery are additions of the 1880s. It was originally thought that the connecting door to the Great Hall was also of this date, but is now accepted as being original. Side rooms on the hall level include a chamber in the round tower, with a hatch above the well, and a small chamber within the south wall which overlooks both hall and courtyard. A machicolation below the hall&#x27;s north window allows objects to be dropped onto attackers in the passage.

Above the hall is a second hall, forming part of the Duchess&#x27; suite of rooms. An oratory in the south wall, overlooking the courtyard, contains a piscina and credence niche. The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. The timber ceiling of the Duchess&#x27; hall, and the timber floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.

=== Great Hall and kitchen tower ===

West of the Lord&#x27;s tower is the Great Hall, , and high to its timber roof, again a 19th-century replacement. The hall has no fireplace, and was presumably heated by a central fire, and ventilated by means of a louvre like the one in the modern roof. No details of the original roof construction are known, however, and the restoration is conjectural. Large windows light the hall, and stairs lead down to the three cellars on ground level.

The hall is accessed from the courtyard via a stair up to a triangular lobby, which in turn links the hall and kitchens by means of two large serving hatches with elliptical arches, unusual for this period. The kitchen tower, virtually a tower house in its own right, is . The vaulted kitchen is on the hall level, above a cellar. One of the best-appointed castle kitchens in Scotland of its date, it has an oven and a fireplace. A stair turret, added in 1581 and possibly replacing a timber stair, leads up from the lobby to two storeys of guest rooms. These include the &quot;Royal Apartments&quot;, a suite of two bedrooms plus an audience chamber, suitable for royal visitors.

=== Courtyard and curtain wall ===
Projecting stones on the south wall of the kitchen block, known as tuskings, and four pointed-arched windows in the south curtain wall, suggest that further ranges of buildings were planned. The large, easternmost window, may have been intended for a chapel, and it is recorded that a chapel dedicated to the 8th-century monk Saint Fillan was located at Doune Castle, but the lack of foundations suggest that there was no large building in this part of the castle. The foundations which do exist were excavated in September 2002, revealing a structure which was interpreted as a kiln or oven against the south wall. The central well is around deep.

The curtain wall is thick, and high. A walkway along the top of the wall is protected by parapets on both sides, and is carried over the pitched roofs of the hall and gatehouse by steep steps. Open, round turrets are located at each corner, with semicircular projections at the midpoint of each wall. A square turret with machicolations is located above the postern gate in the west wall.

=== Interpretation of the layout ===
The Lord&#x27;s tower is a secure, private set of rooms, probably intended for the sole use of the Lord and his family, and with its own lines of defence. The architectural historian W. Douglas Simpson interpreted this arrangement as being the product of the &quot;bastard feudalism&quot; of the 14th century. During this period, Lords were required to defend their castles by means of mercenaries, rather than the vassals of the earlier feudal system, and Simpson suggested that the Lord of Doune designed his tower to be defensible against his own, potentially rebellious, garrison. This interpretation is no longer widely accepted by historians, and the castle is instead seen as a development towards more integrated courtyard buildings, such as the royal palace of Linlithgow, which was constructed through the 15th and early 16th century. The layout of Doune has similarities with those of the contemporary castles at Tantallon and Bothwell, and appears, at various scales, in other buildings of the period.

=== Grounds ===

The castle is surrounded by woodland and parkland along the banks of the River Teith and Ardoch Burn. In 2022 a new footbridge was constructed, spanning the Ardoch Burn. It was built using locally sourced larch timbers and provides a link from the immediate grounds of the castle to the site of an old mill.

== In fiction and drama==

Doune Castle has featured in several literary works, including the 17th-century ballad, &quot;The Bonny Earl of Murray&quot;, which relates the murder of James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray, by George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly, in 1592. In Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Waverley&quot; (1814), the protagonist Edward Waverley is brought to Doune Castle by the Jacobites. Scott&#x27;s romantic novel describes the &quot;gloomy yet picturesque structure&quot;, with its &quot;half-ruined turrets&quot;.

The castle was used as a location in MGM&#x27;s 1952 historical film &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, which featured Robert Taylor and Elizabeth Taylor. The BBC adaptation of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; in 1996 also featured Doune as a location. The castle was used as a set for Winterfell in the first season of the TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (2011–2019), an adaptation of the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of novels by George R. R. Martin.

The castle depicted the fictional &quot;Castle Leoch&quot; in the TV adaptation of the &quot;Outlander&quot; series of novels.

The castle was also used as a location in &quot;Outlaw King&quot;, a 2018 historical action drama film about Robert the Bruce, the 14th-century Scottish king who launched a guerilla war against the larger English army. The film is largely set in the 3 years from 1304, when Bruce decides to rebel against the rule of Edward I over Scotland, thus becoming an &quot;outlaw&quot;, up to the 1307 Battle of Loudoun Hill.

=== &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; ===

The British comedy film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; – a parody of the legends of King Arthur by the Monty Python team – was filmed on location in Scotland in 1974. The film&#x27;s producers had gained permission from the National Trust for Scotland to film scenes at several of their Scottish castles, as well as the permission of Lord Moray to film at Doune Castle. However, the National Trust later withdrew their permission, leaving the producers with little time to find new locations. Instead, they decided to use different parts of Doune Castle to depict the various fictional castles in the film, relying on tight framing of shots to maintain the illusion.

Scenes featuring Doune Castle include:
* At the start of the film, King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and Patsy (Terry Gilliam) approach the east wall of Doune Castle and argue with soldiers of the garrison.
* The song and dance routine &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; at &quot;Camelot&quot; was filmed in the Great Hall.
* The servery and kitchen appear as &quot;Castle Anthrax&quot;, where Sir Galahad the Chaste (Michael Palin) is chased by seductive girls.
* The wedding disrupted by Sir Lancelot (John Cleese) was filmed in the courtyard and Great Hall.
* The Duchess&#x27; hall was used for filming the Swamp Castle scene where the prince (Terry Jones) is being held in a tower by ignorant guards (Graham Chapman and Eric Idle).
* The Trojan Rabbit scene was filmed in the entryway and into the courtyard.

The only other castles used for filming were Castle Stalker in Argyll, also privately owned, which appears as &quot;Castle Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh&quot; at the end of the film, and (briefly) Kidwelly Castle in Wales and Bodiam Castle in East Sussex. The DVD version of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; includes a documentary, &quot;In Search of the Holy Grail Filming Locations&quot;, in which Michael Palin and Terry Jones revisit Doune and other sites used for filming. Doune Castle has become a place of pilgrimage for fans of Monty Python and the film. It used to hold an annual &quot;Monty Python Day&quot;.

<text>Kasseri (Greek: κασέρι, Turkish: &quot;kaşar&quot;) is a medium-hard or hard pale yellow cheese made from pasteurised or unpasteurised sheep milk and at most 20% goat&#x27;s milk. &quot;Kasseri&quot; is a protected designation of origin, according to which the cheese must be made in the Greek provinces of Thessaly, Macedonia, Lesbos, or Xanthi, but a similar type of cheese is found in Turkey, Romania, and the Balkans, where it is known as kashkaval. The same cheese is made with cow&#x27;s milk, but in that case it cannot be legally sold as &quot;kasseri&quot; in the EU and is instead sold under names that are particular to each producer.

Kasseri is of semi-hard to hard consistency, smooth rather than crumbly, chewy, and with a hard rind. It belongs to the pasta filata family of cheeses, which includes fresh cheeses like mozzarella and aged ones like Provolone or Caciocavallo. Kasseri is made by heating milk to and adding enough rennet for a curd to set in 45 minutes. Once the curd has set, it is divided into pieces about the size of a maize cob and then cooked at while stirring. Afterwards, the curd is transferred to draining tables where it is ground to small pieces by hand, tightly bound in cheesecloth, topped with a small weight, and left to drain and ferment until its pH is about 5.2. The curd is then cut into thin slices, placed in hot water at , and kneaded until it becomes a malleable mass that can be spun into a smooth thread of at least in length. The kneaded cheese mass is salted and then put into molds for two or three days. Finally, it is taken out of the mold and aged for at least three months at a temperature of .

The name kasseri is said to come from Turkish &quot;kaşer&quot;, which in turn comes from Hebrew כָּשֵׁר (kosher). The explanation is that the lack of use of rennet during its invention by the Jews of Kırkkilise (modern Kırklareli, Turkey) made the cheese fit for the requirements of the Jewish law. However, rennet is in fact used in the making of kasseri therefore the above is likely a case of folk etymology.

Kasseri is consumed in sandwiches as the main constituent in kasseropita and saganaki.

Assyrians use Kasseri cheese to make a traditional Assyrian cheese dish, called &quot;gupta tomirta&quot; ( &#x27;buried cheese&#x27;), that is topped with cumin and sometimes other seasonings.

<text>In mathematics, a fixed-point theorem is a result saying that a function &quot;F&quot; will have at least one fixed point (a point &quot;x&quot; for which &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;), under some conditions on &quot;F&quot; that can be stated in general terms.

== In mathematical analysis ==
The Banach fixed-point theorem (1922) gives a general criterion guaranteeing that, if it is satisfied, the procedure of iterating a function yields a fixed point.

By contrast, the Brouwer fixed-point theorem (1911) is a non-constructive result: it says that any continuous function from the closed unit ball in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space to itself must have a fixed point, but it doesn&#x27;t describe how to find the fixed point (see also Sperner&#x27;s lemma).

For example, the cosine function is continuous in [−1, 1] and maps it into [−1, 1], and thus must have a fixed point. This is clear when examining a sketched graph of the cosine function; the fixed point occurs where the cosine curve &quot;y&quot; = cos(&quot;x&quot;) intersects the line &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;. Numerically, the fixed point (known as the Dottie number) is approximately &quot;x&quot; = 0.73908513321516 (thus &quot;x&quot; = cos(&quot;x&quot;) for this value of &quot;x&quot;).

The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem (and the Nielsen fixed-point theorem) from algebraic topology is notable because it gives, in some sense, a way to count fixed points.

There are a number of generalisations to Banach fixed-point theorem and further; these are applied in PDE theory. See fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces.

The collage theorem in fractal compression proves that, for many images, there exists a relatively small description of a function that, when iteratively applied to any starting image, rapidly converges on the desired image.

== In algebra and discrete mathematics ==

The Knaster–Tarski theorem states that any order-preserving function on a complete lattice has a fixed point, and indeed a &quot;smallest&quot; fixed point. See also Bourbaki–Witt theorem.

The theorem has applications in abstract interpretation, a form of static program analysis.

A common theme in lambda calculus is to find fixed points of given lambda expressions. Every lambda expression has a fixed point, and a fixed-point combinator is a &quot;function&quot; which takes as input a lambda expression and produces as output a fixed point of that expression. An important fixed-point combinator is the Y combinator used to give recursive definitions.

In denotational semantics of programming languages, a special case of the Knaster–Tarski theorem is used to establish the semantics of recursive definitions. While the fixed-point theorem is applied to the &quot;same&quot; function (from a logical point of view), the development of the theory is quite different.

The same definition of recursive function can be given, in computability theory, by applying Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem. These results are not equivalent theorems; the Knaster–Tarski theorem is a much stronger result than what is used in denotational semantics. However, in light of the Church–Turing thesis their intuitive meaning is the same: a recursive function can be described as the least fixed point of a certain functional, mapping functions to functions.

The above technique of iterating a function to find a fixed point can also be used in set theory; the fixed-point lemma for normal functions states that any continuous strictly increasing function from ordinals to ordinals has one (and indeed many) fixed points.

Every closure operator on a poset has many fixed points; these are the &quot;closed elements&quot; with respect to the closure operator, and they are the main reason the closure operator was defined in the first place.

Every involution on a finite set with an odd number of elements has a fixed point; more generally, for every involution on a finite set of elements, the number of elements and the number of fixed points have the same parity. Don Zagier used these observations to give a one-sentence proof of Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares, by describing two involutions on the same set of triples of integers, one of which can easily be shown to have only one fixed point and the other of which has a fixed point for each representation of a given prime (congruent to 1 mod 4) as a sum of two squares. Since the first involution has an odd number of fixed points, so does the second, and therefore there always exists a representation of the desired form.

<doc id="1011854" wikidata="Q267866" url="?curid=1011854" title="Little Nicky">
<text>Little Nicky is a 2000 American dark fantasy comedy film directed by Steven Brill, written by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler, and Brill, and starring Sandler in the title role, Patricia Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Tommy &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister Jr., Rhys Ifans, and Rodney Dangerfield with supporting roles by Allen Covert, Kevin Nealon, Jon Lovitz, Michael McKean, and Quentin Tarantino.

The film depicts the son of Satan and an angel who is tasked with returning his two brothers to Hell and preventing them from destroying the boundary between good and evil on Earth.

The film received negative reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing $58.3 million against an $80–85 million budget.

==Plot==
With his 10,000-year reign coming to an end, Satan must decide which of his three sons will succeed him as ruler of Hell. Adrian is the most devious, Cassius is the cruelest and Nicky is the kindest. Nicky has had a speech impediment and a disfigured jaw since Cassius hit him in the face with a shovel. Satan assembles his sons to tell them that as they are not yet ready to succeed him, he will continue ruling Hell.

Angered by this decision, Adrian and Cassius travel to Earth to create a new Hell by possessing religious and political leaders in New York City. As they leave, they freeze the entrance to Hell, preventing more evil souls from entering and causing Satan to begin to disintegrate. Stanley the Gatekeeper informs Satan of this and Satan punishes him by growing breasts on his head and giving him to his father Lucifer. Now too weak to stop Adrian and Cassius, he sends Nicky to Earth with a silver flask that traps whoever drinks from it inside.

Nicky has difficulty surviving on Earth and is killed several times, landing in Hell and returning to New York each time. While learning how to eat and sleep, he meets a possessed talking bulldog named Mr. Beefy, rents an apartment with an actor named Todd and falls in love with a design student named Valerie. Nicky encounters Adrian but fails to capture him and scares Valerie away. Nicky then observes Cassius on television possessing the referee of a Harlem Globetrotters game. Nicky arrives at the game and successfully tricks Cassius into the flask. Satanist metalheads John and Peter swear loyalty to Nicky. That evening, Nicky apologizes to Valerie and they reconcile.

The following day, Adrian possesses the Chief of the New York City Police Department and accuses Nicky of mass murder. Nicky has Todd kill him so he can go back to Hell and ask his father for advice. However, Satan has trouble hearing because his ears have fallen off, and his assistants are panicking because the deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is approaching.

Back on Earth, Nicky and his friends devise a plan to capture Adrian in a subway station. Adrian discovers their trick and in the ensuing fight, grabs Valerie and dives onto the track as a train approaches, but Nicky throws her aside, leaving himself and Adrian to be killed by the train.

Arriving in Hell just minutes before midnight, Adrian begins taking over Hell by pushing what remains of his father aside, sitting on the throne, rising to Central Park, and starting a riotous party. Meanwhile, Nicky wakes up in Heaven as a reward for sacrificing himself and meets his mother Holly, an angel who tells him that he can defeat Adrian with the &quot;inner light&quot; that he inherited from her.

After she gives him a mysterious orb, he confronts Adrian in Central Park. Adrian appears to win the battle by transforming into a bat and locking Nicky in the flask. However, Nicky escapes from the flask and shatters the orb, causing Ozzy Osbourne to appear, bite off Adrian&#x27;s head, and spit it into the flask.

With his brothers captured, Nicky prepares to save his father. He and Valerie express their love for each other and she kills him. In Hell, Satan regains his body and suggests Nicky stay with Valerie to maintain things in the middle while stating to Holly that he still loves her. In the presence of Nicky and Satan, Lucifer shoves the flask containing Adrian and Cassius up Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rump.

One year later, Nicky and Valerie live in New York with their infant son named Zachariah who has demonic powers.

A postscript states that Valerie accidentally struck Nicky with a shovel which fixed his jaw disfigurement. Zachariah was suspended from nursery school after turning another kid&#x27;s bottle of milk into moose urine. Todd started his one-man show on Broadway which only a strange man from Adrian&#x27;s park gathering attended. Mr. Beefy reunited with his rat girlfriend Heather where they got married last April and had kids. Stanley the Gatekeeper and Gary the Monster also had kids of their own. Satan and Holly have been unable to deal with their long-distance relationship after dating for a while where Satan has been romantically linked to both the Blair Witch and Cher and Holly immediately fell in love with her new aerobics instructor Chris Farley. Using their $25,000,000.00 reward money, John and Peter purchased Led Zeppelin&#x27;s old touring airplane, stocked it with cake, beer and great tunes, died in a plane crash soon after takeoff due to a lack of a pilot, and ended up happily in Hell as honored residents who have been given Nicky&#x27;s old bedroom to party in.

==Reception==
===Box office===
It opened at #2 at the North American box office making $16 million USD in its opening weekend, behind &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, which was on its second consecutive week at the top spot. The film went on to earn $39.5 million domestically and another $18.8 million worldwide, bringing the total to $58.3 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Little Nicky&quot; has an approval rating of 21% based on reviews from 114 critics, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Despite the presence of a large, talented cast, the jokes in &quot;Little Nicky&quot; are dumb, tasteless, and not that funny, and Adam Sandler&#x27;s character is grating to watch.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 38% based on reviews from 29 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on a scale of A to F.

Comedian and former &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; host Michael J. Nelson named the film the worst comedy ever made. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a score of two-and-a-half stars out of four, describing &quot;Little Nicky&quot; as &quot;the best Sandler movie to date&quot; and the Nicky character as &quot;intriguing&quot;, while at the same time lamenting Sandler&#x27;s lack of finesse and vocal quirks.

In 2020, Evan Saathoff of &quot;/Film&quot; argued against the characterization of &quot;Little Nicky&quot; as being &quot;a blight on [Sandler&#x27;s] filmography&quot;, writing that Sandler &quot;certainly never got &quot;this&quot; wild again, not in one of his own films at least.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for five awards at the 21st Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Adam Sandler), Worst Supporting Actress (Patricia Arquette), Worst Director and Worst Screenplay. It lost in all categories to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; starring John Travolta. At the 2000 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film received seven total nominations: Worst Picture (lost to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;), Worst Actor for Sandler (lost to John Travolta), Worst On-Screen Couple for Sandler and that unfunny bulldog (lost to John Travolta and everyone in the galaxy for &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;), Most Annoying Fake Accent for Sandler, Worst On-Screen Hairstyle for Sandler (lost to both Travolta and Forest Whitaker for &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;), Most Annoying Product Placement for Popeyes Chicken (lost to FedEx and Wilson in &quot;Cast Away&quot;), and Most Unfunny Comic Relief for the painfully unfunny talking bulldog (lost to Tom Green for &quot;Road Trip&quot; and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;). As noted, its only win was for Most Annoying Fake Accent.

==Home media==
&quot;Little Nicky&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on April 24, 2001 by New Line Home Entertainment. The DVD includes two audio commentaries, a special feature dedicated to rock/metal music, the music video &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; by P.O.D., and deleted scenes.

Scream Factory released the film on Blu Ray for the first time on August 8, 2023, with all the special features from the DVD release &amp; a new master from a 2K scan.

<doc id="1011864" wikidata="Q7113363" url="?curid=1011864" title="Over-investing">
<text>Over-investing in finance, particularly personal finance, refers to the practice of investing more into an asset than its worth on the open market. It is cited most frequently in reference to expensive personal consumable investments, such as houses, automobiles, and trailers.

==Example==
Suppose a homeowner makes additions or improvements to their house to the point that the owner has invested considerably more than the market value of other houses in that area. In that case, they likely have over-invested in that house. The &quot;neighbourhood effect&quot; serves to devalue the house so that it is worth less than what has been invested in it. Another example is a person who buys a used car for $2,000 and spends another $2,000 on repairs, even though the 10-year-old car will never be worth more than $3,000 on the open market; they may have over-invested in the car by $1000.

==Avoiding==
Over-investing typically occurs in assets that are partly investment goods and partially consumption goods. Houses and cars are investment goods in the sense that the purchaser expects to be able to resell the asset in the future. They are also consumption goods because the owner can use the asset while he owns it. It is because of this consumption component that people tend to over-invest. They use criteria other than purely financial ones when deciding how much to invest in the asset. They are prepared to spend more on a house or car than it is worth on the open market because they derive benefits from using them. Because of the confusion between consuming and investing, they may over-invest or under-invest compared to what they would do if the investment were clear. Another major problem is that people spend more on consumption value (such as home rent) because they own the asset and mistakenly think that they are investing when they are actually consuming a house bigger than the one they would normally rent. Although they gain something from consuming more since it is more than they would normally consume, they are wasting some money on something they would not normally buy, thus over-investing by over-consuming.

<text>Hexapawn is a deterministic two-player game invented by Martin Gardner. It is played on a rectangular board of variable size, for example on a 3×3 board or on a regular chessboard. On a board of size &quot;n&quot;×&quot;m&quot;, each player begins with &quot;m&quot; pawns, one for each square in the row closest to them. The goal of each player is to either advance a pawn to the opposite end of the board or leave the other player with no legal moves, either by stalemate or by having all of their pieces captured.

Hexapawn on the 3×3 board is a solved game; with perfect play, White will always lose in 3 moves (1.b2 axb2 2.cxb2 c2 3.a2 c1#). Indeed, Gardner specifically constructed it as a game with a small game tree in order to demonstrate how it could be played by a heuristic AI implemented by a mechanical computer based on Donald Michie&#x27;s Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine (MENACE). 

A variant of this game is octopawn, which is played on a 4×4 board with 4 pawns on each side. It is a forced win for White. 

Only 24 matchboxes are required for a hexapawn version of Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine.

==Rules==
As in chess, a pawn may be moved in two different ways: it may be moved one square vertically forward, or it may capture a pawn one square diagonally ahead of it. A pawn may not be moved forward if there is a pawn in the next square. Unlike chess, the first move of a pawn may not advance it by two spaces. A player loses if they have no legal moves or one of the other player&#x27;s pawns reaches the end of the board.

==Dawson&#x27;s chess==
Whenever a player advances a pawn to the penultimate rank and attacks an opposing pawn, there is a threat to proceed to the final rank by capture. The opponent&#x27;s only sensible responses, therefore, are to either capture the advanced pawn or advance the threatened one, the latter only being sensible in the case that there is one threatened pawn rather than two. If one restricts 3× hexapawn with the additional rule that capturing is always compulsory, the result is the game Dawson&#x27;s chess. The game was invented by Thomas Rayner Dawson in 1935.

Dawson&#x27;s chess reduces to the impartial game denoted .137 in Conway&#x27;s notation. This means that it is equivalent to a Nim-like game in which:
*on a turn, the player may remove one to three objects from a heap,
*removing just one object is a legal move only if the removed object is the only object in the heap, and
*when removing three objects from a heap of five or more, the player may also split the remainder into two heaps.
The initial position is a single heap of size .
The nim-sequence for this game is

 0.1120311033224052233011302110452740
 1120311033224455233011302110453748

 1120311033224455933011302110453748 ...,

where bold entries indicate the values that differ from the eventual periodic behavior of the sequence.

<text>HCA Healthcare, Inc. is an American for-profit operator of health care facilities that was founded in 1968. It is based in Nashville, Tennessee, and, as of May 2020, owned and operated 186 hospitals and approximately 2,400 sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers and physician clinics in 20 states and the United Kingdom. As of 2024, HCA Healthcare is ranked #61 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

The company engaged in illegal accounting and other crimes in the 1990s that resulted in the payment of more than $2 billion in federal fines and other penalties, and the dismissal of the CEO Rick Scott by the board of directors.

== History ==

===Early years===

Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) was founded in 1968 in Nashville, Tennessee, by Thomas F. Frist Sr., Thomas F. Frist Jr. and Jack C. Massey. The founders envisioned a company that would bring together hospitals to deliver patient-focused care while using the combined resources of the organization to strengthen hospitals and improve the practice of medicine. The company began with Nashville&#x27;s Park View Hospital, which the elder Frist had founded in 1960 with other doctors and where he was serving as chief executive.

The company included 11 hospitals when it filed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1969 and had 26 hospitals and 3,000 beds by the end of the year. 
===Growth and merger===

The 1970s were characterized by rapid growth in the industry and for HCA Healthcare. In the early 1980s, the focus shifted to consolidation with HCA Healthcare acquiring General Care Corporation, General Health Services, Hospital Affiliates International and Health Care Corporation. By the end of 1981, the company operated 349 hospitals with more than 49,000 beds. Operating revenues had grown to $2.4 billion.

In 1987, HCA Healthcare, which had grown to operate 463 hospitals (255 owned and 208 managed), spun off HealthTrust, a privately owned, 104-hospital company. Believing its stock was undervalued, the company completed a $5.1 billion leveraged management buyout led by chairman Thomas F. Frist Jr. in 1988. HCA Healthcare re-emerged as a public company in 1992.

In February 1994, HCA Healthcare merged with Louisville, Kentucky-based Columbia Hospital Corporation, which earlier had acquired 73 hospitals of Galen Health Care from Humana, 
to form Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation. Related names of note include HCA International and Health Corporation of America.

====Columbia Hospital Corporation====
In 1988, Rick Scott and Richard Rainwater each put up $125,000 in working capital in their new company, Columbia Hospital Corporation; they borrowed the remaining money needed to purchase two struggling hospitals in El Paso for $60 million. Then they acquired a neighboring hospital and shut it down. Within a year, the remaining two were doing much better. By the end of 1989, Columbia Hospital Corporation owned four hospitals with a total of 833 beds.

In 1992, Columbia made a stock purchase of Basic American Medical, which owned eight hospitals, primarily in southwestern Florida. In September 1993, Columbia did another stock purchase, worth $3.4 billion, of Galen Healthcare, which had been spun off by Humana Inc. several months earlier. At the time, Galen had approximately 90 hospitals. After the purchase, Galen stockholders had 82% of the stock in the combined company, with Scott still running the company.

===Recent history===
On November 17, 2006, HCA became a private company for the third time when it completed a merger in which the company was acquired by a private investor group including affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital, together with Merrill Lynch and HCA Healthcare founder Thomas F. Frist Jr. The total transaction was valued at approximately $33 billion, making it the largest leveraged buyout in history at the time, eclipsing the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco.

In May 2010, HCA announced that the corporation would once again go public with an expected $4.6-billion IPO as HCA Holdings, Inc. In March 2011, HCA sold 126.2 million shares for $30 each, raising about $3.79 billion, at that time, the largest private-equity backed IPO in U.S. history. In May 2017, the corporation was renamed HCA Healthcare.

In December 2018, a historical marker was installed in the parking lot of HCA&#x27;s Sarah Cannon Cancer Center in Nashville, formerly the location of HCA&#x27;s first hospital, Park View Hospital.

In 2018, the company was ranked No. 67 in the 2019 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

In May 2021, the company finalized a deal with Google to develop healthcare algorithms using patient records. In August 2021, HCA announced a deal with venture capital firm General Catalyst to develop digital solutions to streamline workflows and improve patient care; as part of the deal, HCA sold its healthcare app development firm PatientKeeper to General Catalyst&#x27;s portfolio company Commure.

In April 2022, HCA Healthcare announced a $1.5 million partnership with Florida International University&#x27;s Nicole Wertheim college of Nursing and Health Sciences, to expand its facilities to address the national nursing shortage.

In October 2022, LCMC Health in partnership with Tulane University announced that it would acquire Tulane Medical Center, Lakeview Regional Medical Center, and Tulane Lakeside Hospital from HCA for $150 million pending regulatory approval.

In March 2024, it was announced HCA had completed the sale of West Hills Hospital and Medical Center and related assets in Los Angeles, California to UCLA Health, for an undisclosed amount.

==Facilities==

===United States===
, HCA has 186 hospitals. They also report operating more than 2,400 additional sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics located in 20 U.S. states and in the United Kingdom. A significant portion of those hospitals are situated in Florida and Texas. As of 2022, HCA had 47 hospitals and 31 surgery centers in Florida, and 45 hospitals and 632 affiliated sites of care in Texas. In 2021, it announced plans to build 3 new hospitals in Florida. In 2022, The Dallas Morning News reported that HCA will build 5 new hospitals in Texas. They also have a strong presence in Tennessee, where it began. HCA had 13 hospitals there as of 2019.

Between 2003 and 2017, HCA did not enter any new markets. However, in July 2007, HCA sold its hospitals in Switzerland.

In 2017, HCA acquired the Memorial University Medical Center in Savannah, Georgia. That same year, they acquired three Houston, Texas, hospitals from Tenet Healthcare.

In 2019 they purchased Mission Health System which operates hospitals in North Carolina.

In January 2020, HCA Healthcare acquired Valify, a healthcare cost-management company. In May 2020, HCA acquired 49-bed Shands Starke (Fla.) Regional Medical Center and 25-bed Shands Live Oak (Fla.) Regional Medical Center from CHS. HCA is operating the two facilities as off-campus emergency departments of Lake City (Fla.) Medical Center and North Florida Regional Medical Center in Gainesville. Later that year, it signed an agreement to sell Garden Park Medical Center to Singing River Health System.

In 2021, HCA sold Redmond Regional Medical Center to AdventHealth for $635M, and four other Georgia hospitals to Piedmont Healthcare for $950 million. They also announced the acquisition of Meadows Regional Medical Center.

===United Kingdom===
, the UK arm of &quot;Hospital Corporation of America&quot;, &quot;caters for around half of all private patients in London.&quot; The main hospital sites within the United Kingdom it operates include:
It opened urgent care walk-in centres at London Bridge Hospital and the Portland Hospital in March 2018. It claims that patients, on average, wait just seven minutes to see a nurse and 17 minutes to see a doctor. In February 2022, outsourced cleaning staff at London Bridge Hospital reported a lack of PPE, no access to sick pay, a lack of training and no prior warning about which rooms may be contaminated with the virus through the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Princess Grace Hospital specializes in breast cancer and surgery, aided by Kefah Mokbel and Nick Perry who, in 2005, founded The London Breast Institute.

The company intends to open The Harborne Hospital, a new-built private hospital located close to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, in January 2024.

==Significant areas of operation==

===Medical education===
In recent years, HCA Healthcare has become a significant provider of clinical and medical education. It is the largest sponsor of graduate medical education programs in the U.S., with 56 teaching hospitals in 14 states, primarily in regions with a deficit of physician training programs. The company includes Research College of Nursing and Mercy School of Nursing, and has several advanced nursing simulation training centers. In early 2020, it completed the purchase of a majority stake in Galen College of Nursing, which operates 21 campuses in 12 states, offering Bachelor of Science and Associate of Science nursing degrees.

==Controversies==
===Medicare billing practices lawsuit===

In 1993, lawsuits were filed against HCA by former employees who alleged that the company had engaged in questionable Medicare billing practices. In 1997, with a federal investigation by the FBI, the IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services in its early stages, the Columbia/HCA board of directors forced Rick Scott to resign as chairman and CEO amid growing evidence that the company &quot;had kept two sets of books, one to show the government and one with actual expenses listed.&quot; Thomas Frist, a co-founder of HCA and brother of U.S. Senator Bill Frist, returned to the company as CEO in 1997 and called on longtime friend and colleague Jack O. Bovender Jr. to help him turn the company around.

The federal probe culminated in 2003 with &quot;the government receiving a total of over $2 billion in criminal fines and civil penalties for systematically defrauding federal health care programs.&quot; Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies and admitted to systematically overcharging the government. The federal probe has been referred to as the longest and costliest investigation for health-care fraud in U.S. history.

===2005 insider trading suit===
In July 2005, U.S. Senator Bill Frist sold all of his HCA shares, which were held in a blind trust, two weeks before disappointing earnings sent the stock on a 9-point plunge. At the time, Frist was considering a run for president and said that he had sold his shares to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. When the company disclosed that other executives had also sold their shares during that same time, shareholders alleged that the company had made false claims about its profits to drive up the price, which then fell when the company reported disappointing financial results. Eleven of HCA&#x27;s senior officers were sued for accounting fraud and insider trading. HCA settled the lawsuit in August 2007, agreeing to pay $20 million to the shareholders but admitting no wrongdoing, and no charges were brought.

===COVID-19 PPE===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, HCA hospital nurses and other workers spoke out about the lack of PPE. In April 2020, there was an outcry against HCA following the deaths of two nurses Celia Yap-Banago and Rosa Luna who worked at HCA hospitals in Kansas City and California and had contracted coronavirus, despite the alarm having been raised about the lack of PPE at work.

===Mission Hospital Acquisition Complaints===
On December 14, 2023, the North Carolina Attorney General sued HCA for violating the terms of an agreement that allowed HCA to purchase Mission Health.

On February 13, 2024, HCA Healthcare denied the allegations and asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit by the Attorney General, and in return the hospital network filed a counterclaim against the Attorney General.

<text>President Theodore Roosevelt High School is a public, co-educational college preparatory high school in Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i. It is operated by the Hawaii State Department of Education and serves grades nine through 12. Roosevelt High School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Roosevelt was ranked as the top high school in Hawaii in 2019 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; (see State and National Ranking, below).

==History==

President Theodore Roosevelt High School is one of the oldest public secondary schools in the state of Hawaii. It was one of the first schools in the state to have compulsory Reserve Officer Training Corps education, a standard from 1934 to 1966.

The school avoided destruction when on March 4, 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy attempted to bomb Pearl Harbor a second time. Weather caused one of the two floatplane bombers to drop its bombs 980 feet from the school, shattering some windows.

Roosevelt High School is most famous for its buildings and landmark domed bell tower constructed in Spanish mission architectural style, currently being restored through grants of the Hawaii State Legislature. Its buildings were used as backdrops in several movie and television productions. Adjacent to the historic bell-towered building is the 2001 Hawaiian basalt sculpture &quot;Hookahi&quot; (To Make as One), by Mark Watson.

=== Shooting ===
In January 2014, a police officer shot a knife-wielding runaway teen who was being detained for trespassing and became disruptive at the school.

==Campus and location==
Roosevelt High School is located in urban Honolulu, Hawaii. It is situated in Makiki&#x27;s Kalāwahine Valley adjacent to the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific overlooking downtown Honolulu and Ala Moana.

<text>Dae Joyeong (; or ; died 719) or Da Zuorong (), also known as King Go (; ; Chinese: Gao), established the state of Balhae, reigning from 699 to 719.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Dae Joyeong was the first son of general Dae Jung-sang, who was also known as Sari Geolgeol Jungsang () or Dae Geolgeol Jungsang ().

Historical sources give different accounts of Dae Joyeong&#x27;s ethnicity and background. Among the official dynastic history works, the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; refers to Dae Joyeong and his state as Sumo Mohe (related to Jurchens and later Manchus) affiliated with Goguryeo. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; also states Dae&#x27;s ethnic background as Mohe but adds that he was &quot;高麗別種&quot; (&quot;gaoli biezhong&quot;). The term is interpreted as meaning &quot;a branch of the Goguryeo people&quot; by South and North Korean historians, but as &quot;distinct from Goguryeo&quot; by Japanese and Chinese researchers. The &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, a 13th-century collection of Korean history and legends, describes Dae as a Sumo Mohe leader. However, it gives another account of Dae being a former Goguryeo general, citing a now-lost Sillan record. Alexander Kim considers this unlikely since Goguryeo fell in 668 while Dae died in 719, and young men could not receive the rank of general.

=== King of Jin (Zhen) and Balhae ===
The Wu Zhou killed Geolsa Biu, and Dae Jung-sang also died. Dae Joyeong integrated the armies of Goguryeo people and some Mohe (Malgal) tribes and resisted Wu Zhou&#x27;s attack. His victory over the Wu Zhou at the Battle of Tianmenling enabled him to expand his father&#x27;s empire and claimed himself the King of Jin (Zhen) in 698. He established his capital at Dongmo Mountain in the south of today&#x27;s Jilin province, and built a fortress, which was to become Zhen (Jin) kingdom&#x27;s capital.

He attempted to expand his influence in foreign politics involving the Tang/ Wu Zhou, the Göktürks, the Khitan, Silla and some independent Mohe tribes. At first he dispatched an envoy to the Göktürks, allying against Tang/ Wu Zhou. Then he reconciled himself with the Tang when Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne.

In 712, he renamed his empire Balhae. In 713, he was given the titular title of &quot;Prince of Commandery of Bohai (Balhae)&quot; (渤海郡王) by Emperor Xuanzong. After a period of rest within the empire, King Go made it clear that Silla was not to be dealt with peacefully because they had allied with Tang to destroy Goguryeo, the predecessor of Balhae. This aggressive stance towards Silla was continued on by his son and successor King Mu of Balhae.

Dae Joyeong died in 719, and his son Dae Muye assumed the throne. Dae Joyeong was given the posthumous name &quot;King Go.&quot;

== Legacy ==
After the fall of Balhae, Dae Gwang-hyeon, the last prince led many of the Balhae aristocracy into the Korean state, thus unifying the two successor states of Goguryeo. Dae Joyeong&#x27;s descendants include modern-day Koreans who bear the surname Tae, or Dae.

In South Korea, a television drama on KBS1 was launched since September 2006 in his honor. Roughly 30% (based on 2007 survey) of the South Korean viewers enjoyed this programme.

The third Chungmugong Yi Sun-sin class destroyer commissioned by the Republic of Korea Navy is named &quot;Dae Joyeong&quot;. KDX-II class destroyers are named after significant figures in Korean history such as admiral Yi Sun-sin.

The Chunbun Ancestral Rite is held annually in Balhae Village, North Gyeongsang Province in order to commemorate the achievements of Dae Jo-yeong. The Gyeongsan City mayor participates in the event, which is open for public participation.

<doc id="1011901" wikidata="Q2464847" url="?curid=1011901" title="Borazon">
<text>Borazon is a brand name of a cubic form of boron nitride (cBN). Its color ranges from black to brown and gold, depending on the chemical bond. It is one of the hardest known materials, along with various forms of diamond and other kinds of boron nitride. Borazon is a crystal created by heating equal quantities of boron and nitrogen at temperatures greater than 1800 °C (3300 °F) at 7 GPa (1 million lbf/in2).

Borazon was first produced in 1957 by Robert H. Wentorf, Jr., a physical chemist working for the General Electric. In 1969, General Electric adopted the name Borazon as its trademark for the material. The trademark is now owned by Diamond Innovations, doing business as Hyperion Materials &amp; Technologies, Inc., and Borazon is manufactured only by Hyperion Materials &amp; Technologies.

==Uses and production==
Borazon has a number of uses , such as: cutting tools, dies, punches, shears, knives, saw blades, bearing rings, needles, rollers, spacers, balls, pump and compressor parts, engine and drive train components (e.g. camshafts, crankshafts, gears, valve stems, drive shafts, CV joints, piston pins, fuel injectors, turbochargers, and aerospace and land-based gas turbine parts such as vanes, blades, nozzles, and seals), surgical knives, blades, scissors, honing, superfinishing, cylinder liners, connecting rods, grinding of steel and paper mill rolls, and gears.

Prior to the production of Borazon, diamond was the preferred abrasive used for grinding very hard superalloys but it could not be used effectively on steels because carbon tends to dissolve in iron at high temperatures. Aluminium oxide was the conventional abrasive used on hardened steel tools.

Borazon replaced aluminium oxide for grinding hardened steels owing to its superior abrasive properties, comparable to that of diamond. Borazon is used in industrial applications to shape tools, as it can withstand temperatures greater than 2000 °C (3632 °F), much higher than that of a pure diamond at 871 °C (1600 °F). Other uses include jewellery designing, glass cutting and laceration of diamonds.

CBN-coated grinding wheels, referred to as Borazon wheels, are routinely used in the machining of hard ferrous metals, cast irons, and nickel-base and cobalt-base superalloys. They can grind more material, to a higher degree of accuracy, than any other abrasive. The limiting factor in the life of such tools is typically determined not by wear on the cutting surface but by its break-down and separation from the metal core resulting from failure of the bonding layer.

==Cultural references==
A Borazon drill is used in the TV miniseries and film &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. In this story an alien spacecraft is unearthed in London and the drill is used in an attempt to open a sealed bulkhead. The shell of the object is so hard that even the Borazon drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, vibrations cause severe distress in people around the object.

In Ivan Yefremov&#x27;s novel &quot;Andromeda: A Space-Age Tale&quot; (written 1954–1956, published Jan 1957) boron nitride named &quot;borazon&quot; is routinely used in sublight engine parts and spaceship surface coating.

In Randall Garrett&#x27;s&#x27;s short story &quot;Thin Edge&quot; (Analog, Dec 1963) a fictional borazon-tungsten cable of extraordinary tensile strength is a central plot element. The cable is developed by asteroid miners for a tow-rope for hauling asteroids. The protagonist cuts through cell bars and booby-traps his room using a single strand of the wire, similar to a monomolecular wire.

<text>Jenna Katerin Moran, previously known as Rebecca Sean Borgstrom and in early publications credited as R. Sean Borgstrom, is an American role-playing game (RPG) writer and designer, and novelist.

==Early life==
While in high school, Moran began to play &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and started to write related fantasy fiction. After high school, she attended Georgetown University, graduating with a Computer Science bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1988. She then earned a PhD in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University in 2000. 

==Role-playing games==
Moran began to write supplemental sourcebooks for existing RPGs, including four for Steve Jackson Games&#x27;s urban fantasy RPG &quot;In Nomine&quot;, and five for White Wolf Publishing&#x27;s epic fantasy RPG &quot;Exalted&quot;. She also co-authored various RPGs including &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, and the second and third editions of &quot;Exalted&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Moran began to create her own RPG universe, where she envisioned the player characters would be powerful servants of the gods who are attempting to save reality from destruction by the mysterious Excrucian Host. In 1999, the resultant diceless indie role-playing game &quot;Nobilis&quot; was released as a &quot;print on demand&quot; publication by Pharos Press. &quot;Pyramid&quot; called it &quot;Complex, unique, and deeply touching, &quot;Nobilis&quot; is one of the most interesting small press RPGs in years.&quot; Moran released a second edition in 2002 with Hogshead Publishing, which became affectionately known as the &quot;Great White Book&quot; owing to its unusual 12x12&quot; form factor. 

In 2005, Moran was the primary author of the &quot;Weapons of the Gods&quot; RPG, the first role-playing game that Eos Press published in-house.

Moran continued to work with Eos, publishing the third edition of &quot;Nobilis&quot; in 2011, but it was later removed from sale after Moran and Eos parted ways. A revised version of the third edition was returned to market in 2022 with new layout and art.

In 2015, Moran created &quot;Chuubo’s Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine&quot;, an RPG with mechanical and setting links to &quot;Nobilis&quot;, set in a small pastoral Town stranded in an endless sea of colorful chaos. Many characters and archetypes in &quot;Chuubo&quot; are recognizable as characters or creature types that were present in Nobilis, but in a weaker (and often friendlier) form. The rules are also similar to those of its parent game, but include additional narrative mechanisms to help players apportion the spotlight and a &quot;quest&quot; mechanic in which players plot out their character arcs ahead of time, and then seek to move through their lives while hitting practical and thematic milestones written on provided &quot;quest cards.&quot;. Player characters are frequently children or young adults, and their stories draw on sources such as the animated films of Studio Ghibli, children&#x27;s literature and television, and folklore.

In 2020, Moran published the diceless RPG &quot;Glitch: A Story of the Not&quot;, flipping the original &quot;Nobilis&quot; plotline by presenting player characters who are retired Strategists of the Excrucian Host, those who were originally trying to destroy Creation, but who have abandoned the war and now seek to build lives for themselves while dealing with the fact that their skillset (as beautiful, terrifying riders of the apocalypse) are ill-suited to leading a normal life. The protagonists of &quot;Glitch&quot; are both physically and magically powerful, but often lack the wherewithal to perform normal mundane tasks, leading to ironic situations as they confront the gods themselves but are unable to make themselves breakfast before doing so. The system combines the quest system from &quot;Chuubo&quot; with the higher-powered mechanics of &quot;Nobilis&quot;, but introduces a new &quot;Cost&quot; system that measures a Strategist&#x27;s power based on her willingness to burn herself out in order to achieve an objective.

==Novels==
Moran has also written a number of novels, some associated with the &quot;Nobilis&quot; setting, while others are associated with her long-form web fiction &quot;Hitherby Dragons&quot;.

*&quot;An Unclean Legacy&quot; (2011) 
*&quot;Fable of the Swan&quot; (2012) 
*&quot;Jack o&#x27;Lantern Girl&quot; (2012) 
*&quot;The Night-Bird&#x27;s Feather&quot; (2022) 

==Awards==
At Gencon 2003, the second edition of &quot;Nobilis&quot; won the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming.

<doc id="1011906" wikidata="Q931679" url="?curid=1011906" title="Montérégie">
<text>Montérégie () is an administrative region in the southwest part of Quebec. It includes the cities of Boucherville, Brossard, Châteauguay, Longueuil, Saint-Hyacinthe, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Salaberry-de-Valleyfield and Vaudreuil-Dorion.

The region had a population of 1,507,070 as of the 2016 census and a land area of , giving it a population density of . With approximately 18.5% of the province&#x27;s population, it is the second most populous region of Quebec after Montreal. The majority of the population lives near the Saint Lawrence River, on the south shore of Montreal.

Montérégie is known for its vineyards, orchards, maple trees, panoramas, and the Monteregian mountains. The region is both urban (second in terms of population in Quebec) and rural. The regional economy is based on agriculture and the production of goods and services. Tourism also makes up a significant portion of the economy.

==History==
Jacques Cartier named Mont Royal in October 1535. Samuel de Champlain built several forts to protect the colonists against the Iroquois from south of the Great Lakes, and against the English, who were colonizing New England to the southeast.

The toponym comes from the Latinized form of Mount Royal, &quot;mons regius&quot;. Montérégie is named for the Monteregian Hills, which are, in turn, named for &quot;Mont Royal&quot; (English: Mount Royal). The term for naming the set of hills in the St. Lawrence Plain was originally created in 1903 in English by geologist Frank Dawson Adams to designate a new petrographic province.

Mount Royal on Montreal Island, although outside the Montérégie region, is one of the Monteregian Hills. In addition to Mount Royal, two other Montérégie hills are not located in Montérégie: Mount Mégantic, in Estrie, and the hills of Oka, in the Lower Laurentians.

Montérégie was populated by the St. Lawrence Iroquoian people when the French began to colonize here in the early 16th century. Later colonists found their villages abandoned, and the area controlled as hunting grounds by the nations of the Iroquoian Confederacy based south of the Great Lakes.

Some of the later battles among the European-Canadians that decided the destiny of Canada took place in Montérégie. For instance, in the 1830s, ethnic French patriots rebelled against British government troops. The Province of Canada (also called a United Canada (French: &quot;Canada-Uni&quot;)) was formed through the Union Act in 1840 and February 1841, from the former provinces of Lower Canada and Upper Canada.

Originally, the administrative territory of the Montérégie parishes were taken from the territory of the canonical Diocese of Saint-Jean-Longueuil.

==Subregions==
The Montérégie has three administrative subregions, each consisting of its own regional county municipalities (RCM) or equivalent territories. The territorial administration of the region was conducted by three regional conferences of elected officers () (CRE) separate and independent in their territory:

* Longueuil, 
* Montérégie-Est (eastern RCMs) and 
* Vallée-du-Haut-Saint-Laurent (western RCMs).

Each sub-region was organized in the same way as other administrative regions of Quebec.

===Regional county municipalities===
There are 12 regional county municipalities and one equivalent territory in Montérégie. In 2021, Brome-Missisquoi and La Haute-Yamaska transferred to Estrie.

====Montérégie-Est====
As of 2021, there are seven RCMs in Montérégie Est. Its seat is McMasterville, and the president is Arthur Fauteux. Its territory occupies and there are 656,287 inhabitants, with a population density of .

====Vallée-du-Haut-Saint-Laurent====
There are five RCMs in Vallée-du-Haut-Saint-Laurent. Its seat is Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, and its president is Yves Daoust. Its territory occupies and there are 435,436 inhabitants, with a population density of .
===Equivalent territory===
==Native Reserves==
The population of both of these reserves are majority-Mohawk, one of the historic Five Nations of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, or Iroquois League. Kahnawake was established south of Montreal in 1719 as a mission village. Akwesasne was established upriver by Mohawk leaders and their families in the mid-18th century, accompanied by French Jesuit missionaries. Akwesasne spans the boundaries of Canada and the United States, extending across the St. Lawrence River into New York State, where it is referred to as the St. Regis Reservation.

<text>Jorge Enea Spilimbergo (born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 25 September 1928; died in Buenos Aires on 4 September 2004) was an Argentine nationalist socialist politician, poet, journalist, and writer. He was one of the founders of the Izquierda Nacional party.

Spilimbergo wrote extensively on Latin America, the &quot;semi-colonial world&quot;, and Argentina. He wrote on the national question and the inner fabric of alleged imperialist policies, gathered in his &quot;The national question in Marx&quot;.

He was influenced by such Marxist leaders and theoreticians as Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Mao Zedong, Ernesto Guevara and Ho Chi Minh. He wrote on themes of the overthrow of class societies and the passage from the realm of necessity to the realm of liberty.

Spilimbergo worked largely in obscurity as a nonperson, allegedly due to objections from both the political right and the left, including from many Peronists, who objected primarily to his criticisms of the alleged national bourgeois limitations of Peronism.

Spilimbergo died in his Buenos Aires home on 4 September 2004.</text><links>

<doc id="1011912" wikidata="Q1115586" url="?curid=1011912" title="Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés">
<text>The Commission nationale de l&#x27;informatique et des libertés (CNIL, ; ) is an independent French administrative regulatory body whose mission is to ensure that data privacy law is applied to the collection, storage, and use of personal data. Its existence was established by the French loi n° 78-17 on Information Technology, Data Files and Civil Liberty of 6 January 1978, and it is the national data protection authority for France. From September 2011 to February 2019, the CNIL has been chaired by Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin. It&#x27;s now chaired by Marie-Laure Denis.

==History==

The CNIL was created partially in response to public outrage against the SAFARI program, which was an attempt by the French government to create a centralized database allowing French citizens to be personally identified by different government services. On 21 March 1974, an article in the newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;SAFARI ou la chasse aux Français&quot; (SAFARI; or, Hunting Frenchmen) brought public attention to the project. Interior Minister Jacques Chirac, freshly appointed following the events of May 1968, had to face the public uproar. Chirac was the successor to Raymond Marcellin, who had been forced to resign in the end of February 1974 after having attempted to place wiretaps in the offices of the weekly newspaper &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;. The massive popular rejection of the government&#x27;s activities in this domain prompted the creation of the CNIL.

At the beginning of 1980, when the CNIL began its main activities, news anchorman Patrick Poivre d&#x27;Arvor announced that the CNIL had registered 125,000 files. By the end of 1980, Poivre d&#x27;Arvor counted 250,000 files (public and private).

==Composition and independence==

The CNIL is composed of seventeen members from various government entities, four of whom are members of the French parliament (&quot;Assemblée nationale&quot; and &quot;Sénat&quot;); twelve of these members are elected by their representative organisations in the CNIL.

The CNIL&#x27;s status as an administrative regulatory body gives it total independence to choose its course of action. However, its power is limited and defined by law. The CNIL is financed by the budget of the French Republic.

==Power==
The CNIL registers the setup of information systems that process personal data on French territories. By September 2004, more than 800,000 declarations of such systems had been made. Additionally, CNIL checks the law to be applied in this domain as well as in about 50 annual &#x27;control missions&#x27;. CNIL can warn organisations or people who are found to be non-compliant with the law, and also report them to the Parquet.

* 300 nominal information systems registered daily.
* 8,000 phone calls handled each month.
* 4,000 claims or requests for information received each year.

==Regulation==
The main principles for regulation of personal data processing are as follows (non-exhaustive list):
* all illegal means of data collection are forbidden;
* the purpose of the data files must be explicitly stated;
* people registered in files must be informed of their rights, for example, for rectification and deletion of data on demand;
* finally, no decision about an individual can be decided by a computer.

The archival of &quot;sensitive&quot; information can result in a five-year prison term and a €300,000 fine.

==European and international contexts==
Germany in 1971, Sweden in 1973, and France in 1978 were the first three States to vote for a &quot;Computers and Liberty&quot; law; these work with an independent control authority.

International, economic, and political structures have been created or assigned to apply CNIL directives. Amongst these are the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1980, the Council of Europe in 1981 and the United Nations (UN) in 1990. In 1995, the European Commission voted through a directive in this manner. As of 2004, 25 countries have applied this directive.

== Criticisms ==

The CNIL is the target of various criticisms, alleging its lack of action and tendency to support governmental legislation, forgetting its original aims of protecting data privacy and citizens&#x27; rights. It is regularly criticised for its lack of administering proper sanctions to data privacy violations. It was criticized, for instance, for having authorized &quot;ethnic statistics&quot;, forbidden in official demographic statistics.

The CNIL has been criticized for attempting to enforce right to be forgotten rulings on search results globally. In 2016, Google appealed a CNIL right to be forgotten ruling on the grounds that it could set a precedent for abuse by &quot;less open and democratic&quot; governments.

<doc id="1011925" wikidata="Q2719790" url="?curid=1011925" title="Islam in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>The documented history of Islam in the Republic of Ireland dates back to the 1950s. The number of Muslims in Ireland has increased since the 1990s, mostly through immigration. For the 2022 Irish census, 81,930 were counted.

==History==
The earliest mention of Ireland in Muslim sources originates in the works of Al-Idrisi in his &quot;Tabula Rogeriana&quot; mentioned &quot;Irlandah-al-Kabirah&quot; (Great Ireland).

The organisational history of Islam in Ireland is complex, not least because of the great variety of ethnic backgrounds of Muslims in the country. The first Islamic Society in Ireland was established in 1959, formed by students studying in Ireland and was called the Dublin Islamic Society (later called the Islamic Foundation of Ireland). At that time there was no mosque in Dublin, so the students used their homes and later rented halls for Jumu&#x27;ah (Friday) and Eid (Muslim holiday) prayers. In 1976 the first mosque and Islamic centre in Ireland was opened in a four-storey building at 7 Harrington Street, Dublin 8. Among those who contributed to the cost of the mosque and Islamic centre was the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. In 1981 the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs of Kuwait sponsored a full-time imam for the mosque.

In 1983, the present building of the Dublin Mosque and Islamic Centre was bought, renovated and the headquarters of the Society moved from Harrington Street to 163 South Circular Road, Dublin 8.

In Cork, prayer halls are located in housing estates. Cork&#x27;s Muslim community operates out of an industrial estate, while hoping to raise money to build a new mosque.

In 1992, Moosajee Bhamjee became the first (and to date only) Muslim Teachta Dála (Member of Irish Parliament).

==Demography and ethnic background==
According to the 2022 census, there were 83,300 Muslims living in Ireland, representing a 29.1% increase over the figures for the 2016 census, remaining very much a minority. Cities and towns with the highest Muslim population according to the 2022 census are:

# Dublin and suburbs: 37,458 
# Cork and suburbs: 4,535
# Limerick and suburbs: 3,394 
# Galway and suburbs: 2,367 
# Waterford and suburbs: 2,084 
# Balbriggan: 1,133
# Dundalk: 996 
# Tralee: 980 
# Drogheda: 915 
# Portlaoise: 810 
# Ennis: 711
# Sligo: 628
# Athlone: 615
# Navan: 592
# Carlow: 564
# Kilkenny: 562
# Swords: 550
# Ballyhaunis: 543
# Cavan: 520
# Mullingar: 497
# Letterkenny: 489
# Killarney: 467
# Naas: 422
# Longford: 402.

The Muslim community in Ireland is diverse and growing rapidly, and its numbers are not determined by the country&#x27;s history to the same extent as the UK and France, where the majority of Muslims are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from former colonies, or Germany and Austria, where the majority of Muslims are Turkish migrant workers and their descendants. Just over 55 per cent of Muslims were either Asian or African nationals with 30.7 per cent having Irish nationality. The census also revealed that of the 31,779 Muslims resident in Ireland at the time of the census, 9,761 were Irish nationals, less than the number of Asians (10,649) although more than the 6,909 African nationals. The census of 2011 found there were 49,204 Muslims in Ireland, &quot;a sharp rise on five years previously&quot;. The Muslim immigration at the end of the 90s was caused by the Irish economic boom and asylum seekers from diverse Muslim countries, and in the 20-year period between 1991 and 2011 the Muslim population increased 1000%, from 0.1% to 1.1% of the population of the republic.

===Age and sex===
There was an increase in the number of Muslims in every five year age group between 2006 and 2016. There were 147 Muslim males for every 100 females in 2006. This gap narrowed to 129 males per 100 females in 2016. The average age of Muslims in 2016 was 26.0 (compared with the State average of 37.4 years). There were 10,884 children of primary school-going age (5-12 year olds) among the Muslim community in Ireland and a further 5,480 of secondary school age.

===Marital status===
Muslims in Ireland are more likely to be married and were less likely to be single compared with the general population. Almost 6 out of 10 were married compared with 4.8 out of 10 for the general population. Divorce is also less prevalent among Muslims compared with the general population.

===Residence===
Just under half (47.3%) of all of Ireland&#x27;s Muslims lived in County Dublin. Dublin City was home to the largest proportion (15.5%), followed by South Dublin (13.1%), Fingal (12.8%) and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown (5.9%).

===Principal economic status===
The economic status of Muslim men and women varied greatly with relatively small numbers of women at work and slightly above average numbers of men looking after the home and family.

Among Muslim men 53.3 per cent were at work in April 2016 with 17.0 per cent unemployed or looking for their first job. In contrast 23.6 per cent of Muslim women were working at the time of the census while a further 1 in 5 (19.5%) were unemployed.

In all 27.4 per cent of Muslim women aged 15 and over were looking after the home or family – significantly higher than the rate for all women at 14.9 per cent.

===Major occupational groups===
There were 17,543 Muslims at work. At a broad occupational level, &quot;professional occupations&quot; was the largest category, accounting for 23.5 per cent of workers. Within this category medical practitioners were the largest occupation, with 2,102 workers and accounting for 12.0 per cent of all Muslim workers compared followed by Chefs (1,349).

==Mosques and denominations==
In 2003, the Islamic Cultural Centre with help from Foras na Gaeilge announced plans to translate the Quran from Arabic into Irish for the first time. The planners found it hard to find speakers of both languages and as of 2018 no translation exists.

In September 2006 an umbrella organisation, the Irish Council of Imams, was established. It represents 14 imams in Ireland, of both the Sunni and Shia traditions. It is chaired by Imam Hussein Halawa (Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland) and its deputy chairman is Imam Yahya Al-Hussein (Islamic Foundation of Ireland). Imam Dr. Umar Al-Qadri (Al-Mustafa Islamic Cultural Centre Dublin 15), Imam Salem (Cork Mosque), Imam Khaled (Galway Mosque) and Imam Ismael Khotwal (Blackpits Mosque) are among its founding members.

<doc id="1011932" wikidata="Q16949441" url="?curid=1011932" title="Love Tractor">
<text>Love Tractor is a band from Athens, Georgia, founded in spring 1980 by guitarists Mark Cline and Mike Richmond, and bassist Armistead Wellford, students at the University of Georgia. Like The B-52&#x27;s, Pylon and R.E.M., Love Tractor has been lauded by critics and music historians as one of the founders of the Athens, Georgia, alternative rock scene. Love Tractor toured extensively and recorded six critically acclaimed albums, consistently topping the college and alternative charts. Love Tractor was particularly known for their instrumental rock.

After a return to the public eye in the late 1990s, Love Tractor released &quot;The Sky At Night&quot; in 2001. The group went back on hiatus in 2002. They reformed in the mid-2000s with a new line-up which recorded three albums.

In 2016 founding members Armistead Wellford and Mark Cline, along with Bill Berry and multi-instrumentalist Douglas Stanley (of The Glands, who had been a major contributor to the band&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;), released the instrumental single &quot;A Trip To the Museum&quot;, heralding a return to the band&#x27;s instrumental roots. On August 13, 2016, all original members of Love Tractor (Mark Cline, Mike Richmond, Armistead Wellford and Andrew Carter) reformed to perform at the Athens Popfest at the Georgia Theatre in Athens, Georgia. The band was accompanied on stage by guitarists Bryan Poole (Elf Power, Casper &amp; the Cookies) and Jay Gonzalez (Drive-By Truckers), drummer Joe Rowe (The Glands, Casper &amp; the Cookies, Pylon Reenactment Society), and synthesist Kevin Dunn (The Fans, Regiment of Women). This enhanced version of Love Tractor (including all three original members) continues to perform live and will be re-releasing the Love Tractor catalog on vinyl as well as previously unreleased songs and new material.

==History==
The band was formed in April 1980 by guitarists Mark Cline, Mike Richmond and bassist Armistead Wellford students at the University of Georgia. The band played their first few gigs (including their debut on July 9 on Barber Street in Athens also known as Pylon Park) with only a drum machine, but drummers Kit Swartz (formerly of The Side Effects) and Bill Berry (future R.E.M. drummer) soon took over rotating duties as drummer. In 1983 Andrew Carter would take over as full-time drummer; after Carter&#x27;s departure, John Poe of Guadalcanal Diary rounded out the lineup. Producer and studio keyboard player Alfredo Villar (of The Fans) contributed to the first two albums. Love Tractor originally performed only instrumental material, but minimal vocals from Richmond were added starting with their second album, &quot;Around the Bend&quot;.

In 1981 the band signed to DB Records. Their first release was a self-titled album, produced by Bruce Baxter (Pylon) and Alfredo Villar. 1983 saw a second album, &quot;Around the Bend&quot;. While on a tour promoting that album&#x27;s release, Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; saw them at Danceteria; in his September 1983 review, he said:

Most of Love Tractor&#x27;s material moved at the steady pace of 1960&#x27;s folk-rock, using winsome guitar leads above a cushion of rhythm guitar and a reassuring bass. Like instrumentals by the Ventures or the Raybeats, Love Tractor&#x27;s tunes use two or three recurring segments and little improvisation. But they don&#x27;t repeat – they develop. Where song lyrics might have told a story, Love Tractor let the texture of the music thicken. The drumming would get busier, or the bass line pushier, or the lead guitar line more intricate; the clear, catchy melodies grew more urgent with each reprise. When a vocal would float in for a few moments, it was just one more unassuming, thoroughly melodic piece of a song.

After two albums, and a college-chart-topping cover of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Neon Lights&quot; (from 1984&#x27;s &quot;Till The Cows Come Home&quot; EP), the band signed to Big Time (America)/RCA, releasing &quot;This Ain&#x27;t No Outerspace Ship&quot; in 1987. After 1989&#x27;s &quot;Themes from Venus,&quot; produced by Mitch Easter, the band went on semi-hiatus. Wellford later joined Gutterball. The band stopped touring completely in 1992, but Cline, Richmond, and Wellford continued in Athens to write songs. Later, the original lineup recorded for RCA and Razor and Tie Records. The band re-formed in 1996 as a performing entity eventually recording 2001&#x27;s &#x27;The Sky at Night&#x27; for Razor and Tie. In 2005 the band released the album &quot;Black Hole&quot; via Fundamental Records, albeit with a substantially changed line up with only Mike Richmond remaining from the original members, and a new progressive rock-influenced sound, with King Crimson, Yes and Uriah Heep cited as reference points. The following year they released &quot;Green Winter&quot; and &quot;Before and After Christmas&quot;, a Christmas album that featured a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;See Emily Play&quot; and artwork parodying the Brian Eno album &quot;Before and After Science&quot;, through Fundamental Records.

Currently Love Tractor is in the middle of rereleasing their back catalog, with a new album expected in 2023.

<doc id="1011941" wikidata="Q4370968" url="?curid=1011941" title="Semi-colony">
<text>In Marxist theory, a semi-colony is a country which is officially recognized as a politically independent state and as a sovereign nation, but which is in reality dependent on and/or dominated by another (imperialist) country (or, in some cases, several imperialist countries or corporations).
==Forms of dependence and domination==
The dependence or domination of semi-colony could take different forms:
*economic - foreign control over the supply of capital, technology and/or essential imported goods; and foreign control over strategic assets, industrial sectors and/or foreign trade.
*political - legal agreements and contracts defining government policy, or the direct intervention by the imperialist country in the political affairs of the semi-colony, to secure client-regimes.
*military - the presence or control exercised by foreign troops, or foreign surveillance. 
*cultural/ideological - the imposition of a foreign culture or foreign religion on the local population through the media, education and foreign consumer products. 
*technological - the dependence on foreign technology, or the technological domination by a foreign country.
*demographic - the immigration into the semi-colony of large numbers of settlers from other countries, which dominate the indigenous population of the semi-colony; the expulsion or killing of indigenous people; and/or the imposition of controls over inward and outward migration.

==Semi-colony and neo-colony==

The term &quot;semi-colony&quot; is often used interchangeably with neo-colony. The term &quot;neo-colony&quot; usually refers to a country which originally was a colony but later became a formally sovereign country, although &quot;de facto&quot; it remained dominated by another country. In this case, there exists a &quot;new&quot; type of (informal) colonialism replacing the old colonialism, despite formal independence. A colony in this sense could have &quot;semi-colonial&quot; status after it formerly obtained sovereign political independence while it remained in many important respects dependent on other countries. Many semi-colonies in Africa, Asia and Latin America are, according to some analysts, still dominated by the imperialist countries which once colonised them, or by other imperialist powers. The suggestion is often that there is the &quot;formality&quot; of sovereignty, but not &quot;real&quot; sovereignty. A semi-colony could be a &quot;partly colonized country&quot; or a &quot;partly decolonized&quot; country.

According to Michael Barratt Brown,

==Gradations of colonization==
The term &quot;semi-colony&quot; is also used for countries which, although they officially never became full-scale colonies, or were not colonized on a very large scale, were nevertheless dominated by and/or dependent on other (imperialist) countries. In this case, there can exist national characteristics analogous to colonial dependence and domination alongside a prior tradition of national sovereignty or political independence (cf. Persia, China, Thailand, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Ethiopia in the 19th century and early 20th century). Countries without colonial past could nevertheless be dominated by a superpower such as the United States, or were dominated by the Soviet Union (see American imperialism, Soviet empire and Russian imperialism). A semi-colonial status is sometimes ascribed to a country, simply because it lacked much capitalist industrial development in its economy, which made the country dependent on other (industrialized) countries for importing modern technology, modern consumer goods and knowledge.

Some semi-colonies were originally &quot;settler colonies&quot; attracting large numbers of foreign immigrants, while in other semi-colonies, the indigenous population always remained the vast majority of the population (see also dominant minority). 

There have been many different types, histories and gradations of colonization, and consequently also many different types, histories and gradations of decolonization. Colonization and decolonization processes in different places usually had both some common characteristics and some unique characteristics. Some analysts suggest that the general colonization and decolonization process can be periodized as a sequence of common &quot;phases&quot; or &quot;stages&quot;. Others argue that there is not really any substantive evidence for a universal sequence of events; each country has its own developmental path, influenced by national peculiarities and its position in the world capitalist order.

In many cases, there is no consensus or broad agreement among historians and social scientists about how exactly the terms &quot;colony&quot;, &quot;neo-colony&quot; or &quot;semi-colony&quot; should be applied to a given dependent country. To some extent, the descriptions can remain controversial or contested.

==Client relationship==

The relationship between the semi-colony and the country (or countries) dominating it is said to benefit: 
*the position of semi-colonial elite or ruling class (which serves both its own interest and the interests of foreign investors and creditors). 
*the imperialist country or its multinational corporations, which obtain profits and cheap resources from their investments in the semi-colony.
*employees in the &quot;advanced&quot; foreign-owned industrial sectors within the semi-colony, which often offer better wages and conditions to skilled industrial workers, as compared to labourers and farmers working on the land.

The semi-colonial predicament however mainly disadvantages the majority of the working population, insofar as balanced economic development is impossible - that is, only those industries and institutions are developed which mainly benefit foreign investors, or which mainly benefit/support the export trade (usually extractive mineral and foodstuff industries).

==Social structures, ethnic composition and political trajectories==
The class structure of a &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;classical&quot; semi-colony features a large mass of peasants and unemployed, a relatively small urban working class and middle class, a class of landowners, and an urban comprador bourgeoisie. However, a variety of different class structures, ethnic compositions and complex political trajectories are possible in semi-colonial countries. For example, 

* During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the British colony of New Zealand (since 1907 a dominion of the British Empire) engaged in imperialist interventions and annexations in the Pacific. Today, New Zealand is a major aid donor in the South Pacific, and a large number of Pacific Islanders now live in New Zealand.

* In what is now Israel, a new colonial settler state arose out of a Jewish insurgency against British rule in Mandatory Palestine during the late 1940s, as well as the 1948 Palestine war against the Palestinians; the state of Israel continues to expand its territory via annexations and depends heavily on military, economic and political support from the federal government of the United States, as well as on private U.S. investors/donors. 
* In the American Revolutionary War, armed forces commanded by George Washington engaged in eight years of conflict with the British which ultimately led to Britain recognizing the sovereign independence of the United States. At the same time, the American government mostly denied the sovereignty of American Indians over their ancestral lands, and not infrequently tried to exterminate the Indians, and/or relocate them to reservations set aside for Indians. It was characteristic of American political thinking, that sovereignty was not necessarily regarded as a good thing or as a bad thing, and that a people or a nation was not automatically entitled to sovereignty and territory because they lived somewhere, and had lived there for a long time. It all depended on the interests that were at stake, what the balance of power happened to be, and what was regarded as a &quot;progressive&quot; policy (see also: United States involvement in regime change and Foreign interventions by the United States).

==Origins of the term==
In his pamphlet on imperialism (1917), V.I. Lenin wrote:

The critical concept of a &quot;semi-colony&quot; was popularized in the earlier years of the Communist International, which classified the countries of the world as being either imperialist countries, semi-colonies, and colonies. From that definition followed a political strategy for the labour movement in each type of country (for example as regards nationalisation of industry, workers&#x27; rights, democratisation, the ownership of land). The general perspective of the Communist International was that it was &quot;impossible&quot; for semi-colonial countries to achieve substantive industrialisation, agrarian reform and the transformation of property relations without a socialist and democratic revolution. In other words, the power of semi-colonial elite had to be overthrown by the workers and peasants, to liberate the country from its client-relationship with foreign powers, and make comprehensive local economic development possible.

The category of &quot;intermediate countries&quot; was officially added in the later 1920s. Thus, for example, at the 15th Congress of the CPSU in 1927, Stalin stated: Usually the &quot;intermediate countries&quot; were independent nations lacking colonies (or without significant foreign territories), with some industrial development as well as a traditional agricultural sector. 

Subsequently, the theoretical discussion about the concept of a semi-colony was influenced by historical studies about semi-colonialism in pre-revolutionary China.

In his 1940 article &quot;On New Democracy&quot;, Mao Zedong wrote:

==Debates and contemporary relevance==

With the expansion of the world market and globalisation especially from the 1970s onwards, the &quot;semi-colonial&quot; status of particular countries became more ambiguous because a number of them (such as the Four Asian Tigers, and the BRICS countries) were able to industrialize to a significant extent &quot;within&quot; the capitalist world market and &quot;without&quot; overthrowing the capitalist state, becoming at least &quot;semi-industrialized&quot; or even fully industrialized countries (see also newly industrialized country). They gained more financial, political and cultural autonomy, they abandoned the old colonial culture, and the local elite became a major foreign investor in its own right. They were no longer clearly under the control of another foreign country, although to a considerable extent still dominated or politically influenced by wealthier countries and international financial institutions.

In the global perspective of the Communist International, each country in the world could be categorized and ranked according to its place in the hierarchy of the capitalist world order, and a correct political strategy could be defined accordingly, for each country. This approach was based on a specific Leninist interpretation of global imperialism and the division of the world into spheres of influence. However, across a hundred years of world development, all sorts of changes have taken place in how countries are positioned in the world economy and in global geopolitics. The majority of countries no longer have the same position that they used to have. This raises the question of whether the critical concept of a &quot;semi-colony&quot; is still relevant, or whether it has become an outdated, archaic concept that cannot accurately describe current realities in world society anymore. 

For example, Australia (previously a colony, since 1901 a dominion of the British Empire, and since 1986 fully independent) has been described as a &quot;client state&quot; but also as an &quot;imperialist&quot; country. (see also Territorial evolution of Australia). Some scholars prefer to use the world-systems theory labels of &quot;core&quot;, &quot;semi-periphery&quot; and &quot;periphery&quot; to describe the structure of the capitalist world order. Other scholars regard the Wallersteinian &quot;world system&quot; classifications to be outdated in the new multipolar world order. Martin Wolf distinguishes between stagnant &quot;low-income countries&quot; and developing &quot;low-income turned into middle-income countries&quot;; he emphasizes the economic divergence of the two in the 21st century. Whatever the case, the definition of a country as a &quot;semi-colony&quot; usually refers to a specific critical analysis of its place in the world economy, world trade and the world political order, as well as to its local political/economic culture and social structure.

==Far Left views==
The concept of &quot;semi-colony&quot; is still used in later Maoist movements, including the Shining Path in Peru, the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and the Communist Party of the Philippines which regard their respective countries as &quot;semi-colonies&quot;.
Some contemporary Trotskyist groups, such as the League for a Fifth International interpret Lenin&#x27;s analysis of imperialism in a way which defines the vast majority of states in the world as semi-colonies, including all of Eastern Europe. According to the revolutionary communist Michael Pröbsting, Greece has become a semi-colony.

Defining the limits of galaxy clusters is imprecise as many clusters are still forming. In particular, clusters close to the Milky Way tend to be classified as galaxy clusters even when they are much smaller than more distant clusters.

== Clusters exhibiting strong evidence of dark matter ==

Some clusters exhibiting strong evidence of dark matter.

== Named groups and clusters ==

This is a list of galaxy groups and clusters that are well known by something other than an entry in a catalog or list, or a set of coordinates, or a systematic designation.

=== Clusters ===

=== Groups ===

The major nearby groups and clusters are generally named after the constellation they lie in. Many groups are named after the leading galaxy in the group. This represents an ad hoc systematic naming system.

== Groups and clusters visible to the unaided eye ==

The Local Group contains the largest number of visible galaxies with the naked eye. However, its galaxies are not visually grouped together in the sky, except for the two Magellanic Clouds. The IC342/Maffei Group, the nearest galaxy group, would be visible by the naked eye if it were not obscured by the stars and dust clouds in the Milky Way&#x27;s spiral arms.

* No galaxy cluster is visible to the unaided eye.

== Farthest clusters ==

* In 2003 RDCS 1252-29 (RDCS1252.9–2927) at z=1.237, was found to be the most distant &quot;rich cluster&quot;, which lasted until 2005.
* In 2000, a cluster was announced in the field of quasar QSO 1213-0017 at z=1.31 (the quasar lies at z=2.69) 
* In 1999, cluster RDCS J0849+4452 (RX J0849+4452, RXJ0848.9+4452) was found at z=1.261 
* In 1995 and 2001, the cluster around 3C 294 was announced, at z=1.786 
* In 1992, observations of the field of cluster Cl 0939+4713 found what appears to be a background cluster near a quasar, also in the background. The quasar was measured at z=2.055 and it was assumed that the cluster would be as well.
* In 1975, 3C 123 and its galaxy cluster was incorrectly determined to lie at z=0.637 (actually z=0.218) 
* In 1958, cluster Cl 0024+1654 and Cl 1447+2619 were estimated to have redshifts of z=0.29 and z=0.35 respectively. However, they were not spectroscopically determined.

== Farthest protoclusters ==

* In 2002, a very large, very rich protocluster, or the most distant protosupercluster was found in the field of galaxy cluster MS 1512+36, around the gravitationally lensed galaxy MS 1512-cB58, at z=2.724 

== False clusters ==

Sometimes clusters are put forward that are not genuine clusters or superclusters. Through the researching of member positions, distances, peculiar velocities, and binding mass, former clusters are sometimes found to be the product of a chance line-of-sight superposition.

<doc id="1011982" wikidata="Q7553974" url="?curid=1011982" title="Soft energy path">
<text>In 1976, energy policy analyst Amory Lovins coined the term soft energy path to describe an alternative future where energy efficiency and appropriate renewable energy sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels.

==Background==
Amory Lovins came to prominence in 1976 when he published an article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; called &quot;Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?&quot;. Lovins argued that the United States had arrived at an important crossroads and could take one of two paths. The first, supported by U.S. policy, promised a future of steadily increasing reliance on dirty fossil fuels and nuclear fission, and had serious environmental risks. The alternative, which Lovins called &quot;the soft path,&quot; favored &quot;benign&quot; sources of renewable energy like wind power and solar power, along with a heightened commitment to energy conservation and energy efficiency. In October 1977, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; ran a cover story on Lovins&#x27;s ideas.

==Soft vs hard==
Lovins viewed the energy problem not as one of an insufficient supply of oil and other conventional energy sources, but rather as one of inefficient energy use, coupled with lack of development of renewable energy sources. Lovins argued that conventional energy production was both energy intensive and a source of substantial pollution. With his reformulation of the energy problem, &quot;environmentalists criticized plans for large-scale energy developments, especially those relying heavily on nuclear power&quot;.

The &quot;soft energy path&quot; assumes that energy is but a means to social ends, and is not an end in itself. Soft energy paths involve efficient use of energy, diversity of energy production methods (matched in scale and quality to end uses), and special reliance on co-generation and &quot;soft energy technologies&quot; such as solar energy, wind energy, biofuels, geothermal energy, wave power, tidal power, etc.

Lovins explained that the most profound difference between the soft and hard paths—the difference that ultimately distinguishes them—is their different socio-political impact. Both paths entail social change, &quot;but the kinds of social change for a hard path are apt to be less pleasant, less plausible, less compatible with social diversity and freedom of choice, and less consistent with traditional values than are the social changes which could make a soft path work&quot;.

==Soft energy technologies==
Soft energy technologies (appropriate renewables) have five defining characteristics. They (1) rely on renewable energy resources, (2) are diverse and designed for maximum effectiveness in particular circumstances, (3) are flexible and relatively simple to understand, (4) are matched to end-use needs in terms of scale, and (5) are matched to end-use needs in terms of quality.

Residential solar energy technologies are prime examples of soft energy technologies and rapid deployment of simple, energy conserving, residential solar energy technologies is fundamental to a soft energy strategy. &quot;Active&quot; residential solar technologies use special devices to collect and convert the sun&#x27;s rays to useful energy and are located near the users they supply. &quot;Passive&quot; residential solar technologies involve the natural transfer (by radiation, convection and conduction) of solar energy without the use of mechanical devices.

Lovins argued that besides environmental benefits, global political stresses might be reduced by Western nations committing to the soft energy path. In general, soft path impacts are seen to be more &quot;gentle, pleasant and manageable&quot; than hard path impacts. These impacts range from the individual and household level to those affecting the very fabric of society at the national and international level.

==Implementation==

Lovins recognised that major energy decisions are always implemented gradually and incrementally, and that major shifts take decades. A chief element of the soft path strategy is to avoid major commitments to inflexible infrastructure that locks us into particular supply patterns for decades.

The following transitional strategy to a soft energy path has been proposed:

*Double the efficiency of oil use, mainly through improved vehicle design (the development of improved hybrid cars, ultralight designs, and streamlined large transport vehicles).
*Apply creative business models which focus on certain advanced technologies and lightweight materials.
*Substitute 25% of U.S. oil needs via a major domestic biofuels industry, which could result in an economic boost for the rural regions that would supply the plant material for biofuels.
*Make natural gas again abundant and affordable through wider use of well-established efficiency techniques.

Lovins argues that the barriers to soft energy paths are not technical, nor in any fundamental sense economic. He suggests that barriers are mainly institutional, and relate to obsolete building codes, an innovation-resistant building industry, promotional utility rate structures, inappropriate tax and mortgage policies, imperfect access to capital markets and fragmentation of government responsibilities.

Lovins wrote in 1977 that &quot;a largely or wholly solar economy can be constructed in the United States with straightforward soft technologies that are now demonstrated and now economic or nearly economic&quot;.

==Film==
&quot;Lovins on the Soft Path&quot; is a documentary film made by Amory and Hunter Lovins. It received many prizes, including Best Science and Technology Film, San Francisco International Film Festival, 1983; Blue Ribbon, American Film Festival, 1982; Best of the Festival, Environmental Education Film Festival, 1982; Best Energy Film, International Environmental Film Festival, 1982; and Chris Bronze Plaque, Columbus International Film Festival, 1982.

<doc id="1011995" wikidata="Q1739392" url="?curid=1011995" title="Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station">
<text>Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station is an 894 megawatt (MW) nuclear power plant, located northeast of Oak Harbor, Ohio, United States. It has a single pressurized water reactor. Davis–Besse is operated by Vistra Corp.

Throughout its operation, Davis–Besse has been the site of several safety incidents that affected the plant&#x27;s operation. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Davis–Besse has been the source of two of the top five most dangerous nuclear incidents in the United States since 1979. The most severe occurring in March 2002, when maintenance workers discovered corrosion had eaten a football-sized hole into the reactor vessel head. The NRC kept Davis–Besse shut down until March 2004, so that FirstEnergy was able to perform all the necessary maintenance for safe operations. The NRC imposed an over $5 million fine, its largest fine ever to a nuclear power plant, against FirstEnergy for the actions that led to the corrosion. The company paid an additional $28 million in fines under a settlement with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).

Davis–Besse was expected to close in 2020 as it is no longer profitable to run when competing against natural gas plants. Plans were updated indicating possible shut down by May 31, 2020. However, Ohio House Bill 6 was signed into law in July 2019 which added a fee to residents&#x27; utility bills that funded subsidies of $150 million per year to Davis–Besse and the Perry Nuclear Generating Station to keep both plants operational. The bill was alleged to be part of the Ohio nuclear bribery scandal revealed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) in July 2020.

== Location and history ==
The power station is located on the southwest shore of Lake Erie about north of Oak Harbor, Ohio and is on the north side of Highway 2 just east of Highway 19 on a site in the Carroll Township. The plant only utilizes , with devoted to the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge. The entrance to the Magee Marsh Wildlife Area is approximately 5 miles east of the power station. The official name according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration is the Davis–Besse Nuclear Generating Station. It is the 57th commercial power reactor to commence building in the United States of America (construction began on September 1, 1970) and the 50th to come on-line July 31, 1978. The plant was originally jointly owned by Cleveland Electric Illuminating (CEI) and Toledo Edison (TE) and was named for former TE Chairman John K. Davis and former CEI Chairman Ralph M. Besse.

Unit One is an 879 MWe pressurized water reactor supplied by Babcock &amp; Wilcox. The reactor was shut down from 2002 until early 2004 for safety repairs and upgrades. In 2012 the reactor supplied 7101.700 GWh of electricity.

In 1973, two more reactors were also ordered from Babcock &amp; Wilcox. However, construction on Units Two and Three never commenced, and these two units were officially canceled in 1981.

== Electricity production ==
== Incident history ==
=== 1977 first stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve ===
On September 24, 1977, the relief valve for the reactor pressurizer failed to close when the reactor, running at only 9% power, shut down because of a disruption in the feedwater system.

This incident later became a precursor to the Three Mile Island accident, in which a pilot-operated relief valve also became stuck open, leaking thousands of gallons of coolant water into the basement of the reactor building.

=== 1985 loss of feedwater event ===
On June 9, 1985, the main feedwater pumps, used to supply water to the reactor steam generators, shut down. A control room operator then attempted to start the auxiliary (emergency) feedwater pumps. These pumps both tripped on overspeed conditions because of operator error. This incident was originally classified an &quot;NRC Unusual Event&quot; (the lowest classification the NRC uses) but it was later determined that it should have been classified a &quot;site area emergency&quot;.

=== 1998 tornado ===
On June 24, 1998, the station was struck by an F2 tornado. The plant&#x27;s switchyard was damaged and access to external power was disabled. The plant&#x27;s reactor automatically shut down at 8:42 pm and an alert (the next to lowest of four levels of severity) was declared at 9:18 pm. The plant&#x27;s emergency diesel generators powered critical facility safety systems until external power could be restored.

=== 2002 reactor head hole ===

In March 2002, plant staff discovered that the borated water that serves as the reactor coolant had leaked from cracked control rod drive mechanisms directly above the reactor and eaten through more than six inches (150 mm) of the carbon steel reactor pressure vessel head over an area roughly the size of a football (see photo). This significant reactor head wastage on the exterior of the reactor vessel head left only of stainless steel cladding holding back the high-pressure (~2155 psi, 14.6 MPa) reactor coolant. A breach most likely would have resulted in a massive loss-of-coolant accident, in which reactor coolant would have jetted into the reactor&#x27;s containment building and resulted in emergency safety procedures to protect from core damage or meltdown. Because of the location of the reactor head damage, such a jet of reactor coolant might have damaged adjacent control rod drive mechanisms, hampering or preventing reactor shut-down. As part of the system reviews following the accident, significant safety issues were identified with other critical plant components, including the following:
# the containment sump that allows the reactor coolant to be reclaimed and reinjected into the reactor;
# the high pressure injection pumps that would reinject such reclaimed reactor coolant;
# the emergency diesel generator system;
# the containment air coolers that would remove heat from the containment building;
# reactor coolant isolation valves; and
# the plant&#x27;s electrical distribution system.

The resulting corrective operational and system reviews and engineering changes took two years. Repairs and upgrades cost $600 million, and the Davis–Besse reactor was restarted in March 2004. To replace the reactor vessel head, FirstEnergy purchased one from the mothballed Midland Nuclear Power Plant in Midland, Michigan.

The NRC determined that this incident was the fifth-most dangerous nuclear incident in the United States since 1979, and imposed its largest fine ever—more than $5 million—against FirstEnergy for the actions that led to the corrosion.

==== Criminal prosecutions ====
In January 2006, First Energy, the owner of Davis–Besse, acknowledged a series of safety violations by former workers, and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). The deferred prosecution agreement related to the March 2002 incident. The deferment granted by the NRC were based on letters from Davis–Besse engineers stating that previous inspections were adequate. However, those inspections were not as thorough as the company suggested, as proved by the material deficiency discovered later. In any case, because FirstEnergy cooperated with investigators on the matter, they were able to avoid more serious penalties. The company paid $28 million under a settlement with the Justice Department. $23.7 million of that were fines, with an additional $4.3 million to be contributed to various groups, including the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Habitat for Humanity, and the University of Toledo as well as to pay some costs related to the federal investigation.

Two former employees and one former contractor were indicted for statements made in multiple documents and one videotape, over several years, for hiding evidence that the reactor pressure vessel was being corroded by boric acid. The maximum penalty for the three was 25 years in prison. The indictment mentions that other employees also provided false information to inspectors, but does not name them. In 2007, one of these men was convicted and another acquitted of hiding information from and lying to the NRC. Another jury trial in 2008 convicted the remaining engineer of similar crimes.

=== 2003 slammer worm computer virus ===
In January 2003, the plant&#x27;s private network became infected with the slammer worm, which resulted in a five-hour loss of safety monitoring at the plant.

=== 2008 discovery of tritium leak ===
The NRC and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) were notified of a tritium leak accidentally discovered during an unrelated fire inspection on October 22, 2008. Preliminary indications suggest radioactive water did not infiltrate groundwater outside plant boundaries.

=== 2010 replacement reactor head problems ===
During a scheduled refueling outage in 2010, ultrasonic examinations performed on the control rod drive mechanism nozzles penetrating the reactor vessel closure head identified that two of the nozzles inspected did not meet acceptance criteria. FirstEnergy investigators subsequently found new cracks in 24 of 69 nozzles, including one serious enough to leak boric acid. Crack indications required repair prior to returning the vessel head to service. Control rod drive nozzles were repaired using techniques proven at other nuclear facilities. The plant resumed operation in 2010. The existing reactor vessel head was scheduled for replacement in 2011.

=== 2011 shield building cracks ===
An October 2011 shutdown of the plant for maintenance revealed a 30 foot long hairline crack in the concrete shield building around the containment vessel.

=== 2012 reactor coolant pump seal pinhole leak ===
On June 6, 2012, an approximately 0.1 gpm pinhole spray leakage was identified from a weld in a seal of the reactor coolant pump during a routine reactor coolant system walkdown inspection. The plant entered limited operations, and root cause analysis was undertaken.

=== 2015 steam leak shutdown ===
On May 9, 2015, a steam leak in the turbine building caused FirstEnergy operators to declare an &#x27;Unusual Event&#x27; and shut the reactor down until repairs could be made. The plant was brought back online and synchronized with the local power grid at May 12 after repairs were completed.

== Future ==
The facility&#x27;s original nuclear operating license was set to expire on April 22, 2017. In August 2006, FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) submitted a letter of intent to renew. The submission date for the application was August 10, 2010. On December 8, 2015, the NRC granted a 20-year license extension to expire on April 22, 2037. On March 31, 2018, FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company filed for Bankruptcy protection. Around that time, the company indicated it would close the nuclear plant. In 2019, Ohio lawmakers debated a $9/MWh subsidy to keep Davis–Besse open. House Bill 6 was signed into law on July 23, 2019, and FirstEnergy announced it would refuel Davis–Besse and rescind its deactivation notice on July 24, 2019. It was later learned that the bill itself was a part of a public corruption scheme revealed by the Justice Department in July 2020.

==Seismic risk==
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#x27;s estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Davis–Besse was 1 in 149,254, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.

== Surrounding population ==

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.

The 2010 U.S. population within of Davis–Besse was 18,635, an increase of 14.2 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,791,856, an increase of 1.4 percent since 2000. Cities within include Sandusky, Ohio, ; Toledo, Ohio ; and Detroit, Michigan, (distance to the city centers).
U.S. Census data for Canadian population within the area is not available, though Leamington, Ontario (population: 30,000) is away, and Windsor, Ontario (population: 241,000) is from Davis–Besse.

The cooling tower for Davis–Besse stands at 493 feet above the surrounding area, making it a major landmark around the western end of Lake Erie. The tower is visible from the Michigan and Ontario shores and on clear days the condensing steam plume can be seen from Bowling Green, Ohio, over 40 miles away.

<text>A Cooper vane (also sometimes called a Dan Cooper switch or D.B. Cooper device) is a mechanical aerodynamic wedge that prevents the ventral airstair of an aircraft from being lowered in flight.

==History==
In the United States, following three hijackings in 1972, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered that Boeing 727 aircraft be fitted with Cooper vanes. The device was named for an unidentified airplane hijacker dubbed D. B. Cooper, who used the rear airstair to exit a Boeing 727 in flight and make a parachute escape.

==Design==
The Cooper vane is a very simple device: It consists of a spring-loaded paddle connected to a plate that prevents the ventral airstair of an aircraft from being lowered in flight. When the aircraft is on the ramp, the spring keeps the paddle perpendicular to the fuselage, and the attached plate does not block the stairway. As the aircraft takes off, the airflow pushes the paddle parallel to the fuselage and the plate is moved underneath the stairway, preventing it from being lowered. Once the airflow decreases on landing, the spring-loaded paddle returns to its initial position, thereby allowing the stairs to be lowered again. 

McDonnell Douglas DC-9 aircraft with ventral stairs were also equipped with Cooper vanes.

<doc id="1012020" wikidata="Q172211" url="?curid=1012020" title="Jamie Carragher">
<text>James Lee Duncan Carragher ( ; born 28 January 1978) is an English football analyst and former player who played as a defender for Premier League club Liverpool during a career which spanned 17 years. A one-club man, he was Liverpool&#x27;s vice-captain for ten years, and is the club&#x27;s second-longest ever serving player, making his 737th appearance for Liverpool in all competitions on 19 May 2013. Carragher also holds the record for the most appearances in European competition for Liverpool with 149. 

Carragher started his career at the Liverpool Academy, making his professional debut in the 1996–97 season, and becoming a first-team starter the following season. Having initially played as a full-back, the arrival of manager Rafael Benítez in 2004 saw Carragher move to become a centre-back, where he found his best form. His honours with Liverpool total two FA Cups, three Football League Cups, two FA Charity/Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup and two UEFA Super Cups.

Internationally, Carragher held the national record for most caps at under-21 level and earned his senior debut in 1999. He represented England at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, before announcing his retirement from international football in 2007. He did, however, temporarily come out of retirement in order to represent England at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, before retiring again with 38 senior England caps.

Following his retirement in 2013, Carragher joined Sky Sports as a commentator and pundit. In July 2020, CBS Sports announced Carragher would join their Champions League studio broadcast team.

==Early life==
James Lee Duncan Carragher was born in Bootle on 28 January 1978. His maternal grandfather was Maltese, and his paternal grandfather was Irish. He has described his mother as a &quot;very holy&quot; Catholic woman who had previously suffered miscarriages but refused to consider an abortion whilst pregnant with Carragher, despite doctors expecting him to be born with spina bifida. He was born with gastroschisis, requiring him to be immediately taken to Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Despite the popular misconception that he grew up in poverty, Carragher clarified in his autobiography that he &quot;grew up in a nice house in a nice area [and] had a great childhood&quot;. He attended St James Catholic Primary School in Bootle. He supported Everton like his father, who gave him his two middle names &quot;Lee&quot; and &quot;Duncan&quot; in honour of the team&#x27;s manager Gordon Lee and its player Duncan McKenzie; on the day of Carragher&#x27;s birth, Lee fired McKenzie from the team.

==Club career==
===Beginnings and Cup treble (1988–2004)===
Carragher attended the FA&#x27;s School of Excellence in Lilleshall as a youth. He joined Liverpool, Everton&#x27;s Merseyside rivals, in 1988; he regularly attended Liverpool&#x27;s School of Excellence wearing a Graeme Sharp Everton kit. He spent a year at the Everton School of Excellence at the age of 11, but returned to Liverpool due to the club&#x27;s superior coaching set-up under Steve Heighway. He failed to impress in his first appearances to the Liverpool A and B teams due to his then-small stature, but after being moved from up front to a midfield role he was able to establish himself in the reserve team. He played his first game for the reserves in the 1994–95 season, and was named man of the match against Blackburn Rovers at Haig Avenue. He helped Liverpool to win the 1996 FA Youth Cup with a 4–1 aggregate victory over a West Ham United side that included Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard.

Carragher was tried out in defence for the first time during the tournament, and later admitted that Liverpool were not the most technically gifted side in the competition, but instead relied on team spirit and the outstanding talents of Michael Owen.

He made his first-team debut for the &quot;Reds&quot; under Roy Evans in a League Cup quarter-final against Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on 8 January 1997, coming on as a substitute for Rob Jones 75 minutes into a 2–1 defeat. Three days later, he made his Premier League debut as a substitute at Anfield, playing the entire second half of a 0–0 draw with West Ham United. On 18 January, he was scheduled to play as a centre-half against Aston Villa, only to be replaced in the starting line-up by Bjørn Tore Kvarme; however, Patrik Berger was taken ill, and Carragher was his last-minute replacement in central midfield. He played alongside Jamie Redknapp and scored his first goal with a header in front of the Kop in a 3–0 win. Despite this auspicious start, it proved to be his last contribution to the 1996–97 campaign.

Carragher broke into the first team in the 1997–98 season as Liverpool struggled to keep pace with Arsenal and Manchester United despite having talented players such as Owen, Redknapp, Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman and Paul Ince. Throughout his early playing career, he was essentially used as a utility player that spent time as a centre-half, full-back and defensive midfielder in a squad that was often negatively labelled the &quot;Spice Boys&quot;.

Carragher learned to shun the spotlight and focus on football instead as new manager Gérard Houllier used him consistently in a new continental side focused on discipline. In his autobiography, &quot;Carra&quot;, Carragher admitted that &quot;I always felt close to Gérard&quot;, and was full of praise for the French manager during the early part of his reign. He went on to make 44 appearances in the 1998–99 season, and was named as the club&#x27;s Player of the Year.

Carragher was restricted to the right-back position after scoring two own goals in a 3–2 home defeat to Manchester United early in the 1999–2000 season. Houllier never again played him at centre-back, as Sami Hyypiä and Stéphane Henchoz formed a solid partnership.

The 2000–01 season saw Carragher switch to the left-back position and win his first senior honours, as Liverpool went on to win the FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Cup, Community Shield and Super Cup in the space of just a few months.

During a January 2002 FA Cup tie against Arsenal, Carragher threw a coin back into the stands that had been tossed at him and received a red card. He escaped an FA misconduct charge after publicly apologising, but he did receive a formal police warning about the incident.

From 2002 to 2004, Carragher sufferered two serious injuries, missing the 2002 FIFA World Cup for an operation on his knee, and later receiving a broken leg after a tackle by Blackburn Rovers&#x27; Lucas Neill at Ewood Park in September 2003. During this period, his place in the team was also threatened by signings of Steve Finnan and John Arne Riise. Despite this, he was able to win a second League Cup in 2003 with Liverpool, and shortly afterwards was named the club&#x27;s vice-captain.

===Champions League and FA Cup success (2004–2007)===

The 2004–05 season proved to be a career-defining one for Carragher. New manager Rafael Benítez moved him to centre-half, where he made 56 appearances all season alongside Sami Hyypiä. Carragher developed a reputation as a strong and positionally astute defender and remained in the centre-half position for the rest of his career.

This season saw Carragher prove central to Liverpool&#x27;s triumph in the UEFA Champions League, in particular when he made two vital last-ditch intercepts in the final in extra-time whilst suffering from cramp. Carragher was awarded the Liverpool Player of the Year Award at the end of the campaign, and went on to captain the team to their UEFA Super Cup victory over CSKA Moscow. He was nominated for football&#x27;s most prestigious individual accolade, the Ballon d&#x27;Or, in 2005.

In May 2006, Carragher played in the FA Cup Final against West Ham United, his tenth final in as many years of club football. Despite scoring an own goal in the 21st minute, Liverpool went on to win the final 3–1 on penalties after the match finished 3–3 after extra-time, giving Carragher his second FA Cup win. He appeared in the FA Community Shield win two months later.

On 9 December 2006, Carragher scored his first league goal since January 1999, in a match against Fulham at Anfield. Fellow defender Daniel Agger flicked the ball on from a corner, and Carragher slid the ball under Fulham keeper Jan Laštůvka at the far post. The goal was only his fourth in his Liverpool career.

In Liverpool&#x27;s Champions League semi-final second leg against Chelsea on 1 May 2007, Carragher set a new record for the most appearances in European competition for the club—his 90th European match—taking him past Ian Callaghan&#x27;s 89 matches between 1964 and 1978.

Carragher was voted as Liverpool&#x27;s Player of the Year for a third time after the 2006–07 season by the fans, and immediately agreed a contract extension until 2011. That season also saw Carragher announce his international retirement, citing frustration with a lack of appearances under Steve McClaren.

===Later Liverpool career (2007–2013)===
The 2007–08 season saw Carragher reach his 500th appearance for Liverpool, for which he was made captain. On 18 May 2009, in the match against West Bromwich Albion, Carragher was involved in an on-field clash with fellow defender Álvaro Arbeloa, and the two had to be separated by teammates Xabi Alonso and Daniel Agger. Manager Rafael Benítez refused to comment on the matter, while Carragher later explained, &quot;We want to keep a clean sheet and we want Pepe to have a chance of the Golden Glove for the fourth season running.&quot;

The following season saw many questioning his performances and whether he should remain in the starting line-up, although a solid performance against Manchester United on 25 October 2009 silenced his critics. Four days later, he was sent off in a game against Fulham, which was his first red card in more than seven years.
On 4 September 2010, a mixture of Liverpool players past and present played an Everton XI in Carragher&#x27;s charity fund-raising testimonial match. All proceeds from the game at Anfield went to local charities through Carragher&#x27;s 23 Foundation. He scored a goal for each side as his Liverpool team beat the visitors 4–1, first by scoring from the spot for the Reds, then converting a second-half penalty own goal for the club he had supported as a boy.

On 24 October 2010, Carragher scored his seventh own goal in the Premier League. Weeks later, he dislocated his shoulder in a 2–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He was out for around three months with the injury as it required surgery. He returned on 6 February against Chelsea.
On 24 February 2011, Carragher made his 137th European appearance in a match against Sparta Prague at Anfield, setting a new British record. On 17 April 2011, during a match against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, both Carragher and Jon Flanagan tried to head away the same ball, resulting in their heads colliding and Carragher being knocked out. After six minutes of treatment, Carragher was stretchered off and replaced by Sotirios Kyrgiakos. Carragher recovered in time to make his 666th appearance for Liverpool days later, in a 5–2 victory against Fulham. This appearance put Carragher second in the list of Liverpool&#x27;s all-time appearance makers, behind Ian Callaghan with 857 games. In 2012, Carragher won a third League Cup with Liverpool.

In the first game of the 2012–13 season, and the start of Brendan Rodgers&#x27; term as Liverpool manager, Carragher made his 700th appearance for Liverpool in a 1–0 victory in the Europa League third-round qualifying tie against FC Gomel. Carragher often captained the side during the Europa League, and after a period of time only making league appearances as a substitute, he began to again earn a string of starting places.

===Retirement===

On 7 February 2013, Carragher announced that he would retire at the end of the season, stating &quot;It has been a privilege and honour to represent this great club for as long as I have and I am immensely proud to have done so since I was 9.&quot;

On 9 March 2013, he played his 500th league game for Liverpool, in a 3–2 win over Tottenham Hotspur. On 19 May 2013, Carragher played his 737th and final game for Liverpool in a 1–0 win over Queens Park Rangers. Before the match, he was given a guard of honour and was presented with a special trophy commemorating his career by Steven Gerrard and Ian Callaghan. During the match, despite his sparse goal record, Carragher hit Robert Green&#x27;s post with a 30-yard strike, before being substituted in the 87th minute to a standing ovation from both sets of fans and players.

==Post-retirement activity==
In 2009, Carragher set up the 23 Foundation, a charitable foundation with the stated aims of helping the youth of Merseyside. In 2010, he donated all the proceeds from his testimonial year to the charity which created an initial fund of £1 million.

In August 2015, Jamie Carragher visited &quot;Carragher&#x27;s&quot;, a pub dedicated to his career at Liverpool, on West 39th street, Manhattan, New York. It was revealed that Carragher would return to the pitch to play for England in Soccer Aid, a charity football match in aid of UNICEF, alongside Robbie Fowler.

In January 2018, Carragher visited Kingsway House, a shelter which had been set up for rough sleepers by Liverpool hotel firm Signature Living. He spent several hours talking to homeless residents and the volunteers and announced plans for a special charity football match featuring ex-Liverpool and ex-Everton players and celebrities.

Carragher has worked with Liverpool fan Andy Grant, a former Royal Marine who was hit by a bomb in Afghanistan which resulted in his right leg being amputated, in helping to promote his story and his subsequent autobiography. Both men are from Bootle, and Grant has said: &quot;It&#x27;s safe to say I never dreamed that at 30 I would be able to call on a mate and have him host a night of talking about my autobiography&quot;. In May 2018, Grant released his book &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk&quot;. Carragher was present at several of the book launches and provided the book&#x27;s foreword.

On 10 October 2018, Carragher joined the opening of Cotton Street shelter. The Cotton Street Project welcomes Liverpool&#x27;s most vulnerable members of society to enjoy the shelter. Carragher said: &quot;What Lawrence is doing is fantastic. I am proud to give him and the Cotton Street Project my support. I&#x27;ll be keeping in regular contact with those using the shelter and hopefully helping them to turn their lives around for the better.&quot;

==International career==
In 1996, Carragher made his first appearance for the England U21 side. Playing as a defensive midfielder, he became a regular for the team and was eventually made captain. By 2000, when he became ineligible for the team due to age, he had set the record for the most caps at this level with 27. This record was later eclipsed in 2007 by former Liverpool goalkeeper Scott Carson.

On 28 April 1999, he earned his first cap for the senior England team, coming on as a substitute against Hungary. He made his full international début against Netherlands at White Hart Lane in 2001, and later came on as a substitute in England&#x27;s famous 5–1 victory over Germany in the Olympiastadion. Carragher missed the 2002 FIFA World Cup to undergo surgery on a knee injury; although he had the option to delay surgery, this would have required him to miss pre-season training with Liverpool.

He was selected for UEFA Euro 2004 but did not play a game, Ledley King being preferred in his position. He was later selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and although not in the original starting eleven, he replaced Gary Neville, who suffered an injury.

Carragher was one of three players to have a penalty saved by Portugal&#x27;s Ricardo, as England yet again succumbed to a penalty shoot-out exit in the quarter-finals. Carragher, who had been brought on as a substitute for Aaron Lennon late in the game, scored with his first attempt but was forced to re-take his penalty by referee Horacio Elizondo, who had not blown his whistle. Carragher&#x27;s shot hit the bar from the follow-up attempt.

During a Euro 2008 qualifier, against Israel, in Tel Aviv, Carragher hit the bar with a looping header as the match ended goalless.

On 9 July 2007, it was reported that Carragher was considering retiring from the England squad. When Talksport host Adrian Durham accused Carragher of &quot;bottling it&quot; on his programme, Carragher phoned in to defend himself and say that as he was not being regularly selected he was indeed thinking about retirement, but would leave it until the upcoming match against Germany to decide. Carragher did retire from international football, although he left open the possibility to return if needed for an international tournament. In his autobiography, he stated a number of reasons for his retirement: he prioritised Liverpool over England, he wanted to spend more time with his family, and most of all he was unwilling to feature as a squad player.

On 11 May 2010, it was announced that Carragher had been named in Fabio Capello&#x27;s preliminary 30-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Carragher said of his return to international football, &quot;The FA got in touch a few weeks ago and asked if I would have a rethink, due to injury problems; I said I would make myself available.&quot;

On 24 May, Carragher played his first match for England in three years, a friendly against Mexico which England won 3–1. Carragher appeared in both of England&#x27;s opening World Cup games, receiving a booking in each which resulted in a one-match ban. He was not selected for the knock-out stage exit at the hands of Germany, being dropped in favour of Matthew Upson. Carragher permanently retired from international football, stating that his international return had been a &quot;one-off&quot; due to injuries to other players.

==Style of play==

Carragher played as an attacking midfielder in his early days at Anfield and had been a striker as a child, but he soon learned the art of defending. He was able to play across the back four, often playing as a utility full back on either flank, and occasionally in the centre of midfield early in his Liverpool career but went on to spend most of his time at club and country level at centre-back. When playing at full back Carragher was sometimes labelled as a &quot;limited defender&quot; as he compared unfavourably with attacking full-backs due to his lack of pace or notable technical skills.

As a centre back, he came into his own, and came to be regarded as one of the best English and Premier League defenders of his generation. A strong, versatile and consistent old-fashioned centre-back, who was known in particular for his work-rate, stamina, loyalty, leadership and commitment, as well as his courageous, no-nonsense and hard-tackling playing style, Carragher was gifted with organisational ability, intelligence, concentration, and tactical awareness, which enabled him to excel at reading the game, chase down opponents, and produce last-ditch tackles.

Former teammate Jamie Redknapp described him as &quot;ultra competitive and probably the most driven footballer I have ever met&quot;. Carragher was named by Didier Drogba as the toughest opponent he had ever played against with the Ivorian describing him as an aggressive but fair defender.

In addition to his defensive skills, Carragher was also known for his longevity.

==Media career==
Carragher signed a contract with Sky Sports for the 2013–14 season to appear as a pundit alongside Graeme Souness, Gary Neville and Jamie Redknapp. Carragher appeared on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; on Sky Sports alongside Gary Neville with presenter Ed Chamberlin from 2013 to 2016. Carragher and Neville were praised for their analysis, with their former on-field rivalry adding to their personalities on-air.

Carragher is an occasional sports columnist for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. In January 2014 the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; struck a partnership deal with Talksport radio which saw &quot;Mail&quot; journalists and columnists, including Carragher, appear as guests on the station.

In August 2017, Danish Sports Channel TV3 Sport, signed Carragher as its new football expert. He provided live analysis of the UEFA Champions League.

On 11 October 2017, Carragher was unveiled as &quot;The Telegraph&quot;″s new football columnist. In June 2018, he joined its team of commentators to cover the World Cup in Russia. He also featured in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;″s Total Football podcast throughout the tournament.

On 11 March 2018, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; published a video showing Carragher spitting at a car carrying a man and 14-year-old girl after covering Manchester United&#x27;s 2–1 win over Liverpool for Sky. The man driving the vehicle &quot;goaded&quot; Carragher, shouting &quot;Unlucky Jamie lad. Two, one.&quot; After the video surfaced, Carragher issued an apology to the driver and his daughter, calling it a &quot;moment of madness&quot; and the &quot;worst mistake&quot; of his career. He was suspended by Sky Sports and removed from TV3 Sport&#x27;s coverage the following day. He returned to TV3 Sport in early April 2018. Peter Norrelund, CEO of Modern Times Group issued a statement, saying, &quot;I do not think that a single mistake should have such serious consequences that we can no longer have Jamie Carragher on the team. Therefore, he is back on the football field for TV3 when quarter-finals are played in early April.&quot; Carragher made a brief appearance on Sky Sports in July, giving an interview following England&#x27;s World Cup semi-final defeat to Croatia, before resuming his role as a football pundit in August 2018 for the start of the 2018–19 Premier League season.

Carragher also became a part of CBS Sports&#x27; UEFA Champions League coverage, notably featuring with Kate Scott, Micah Richards and Thierry Henry in a show that achieved widespread critical acclaim.

==Personal life==
Carragher married his childhood sweetheart, Nicola Hart, in 2005. They have a daughter, Mia, and a son, James, who is also a footballer.

Carragher occasionally visits schools as part of his charity work, promoting the importance of family life, and is a patron of the Alder Hey Charity. He was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Sefton for his local charity work and &quot;the exceptional example he sets to the youth of today&quot; in 2008.

Carragher&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Carra&quot;, was released in 2008.

Carragher endorsed and donated to Andy Burnham in the 2010 Labour Party leadership election. In 2023, he told &quot;UnHerd&quot; that he was not fully into politics because he is &quot;a little bit wary of getting too involved in something that&#x27;s not [his] area of expertise&quot;. However, he praised the people of Liverpool for their political awareness: &quot;We stand up for ourselves, we don&#x27;t accept what the government is saying about a certain thingeven now, 30 or so years after Hillsborough. [...] The city doesn&#x27;t allow people to walk all over us, and maybe that [annoys people] around other parts of the country. But I actually love that about this city. It&#x27;s got that real backbone and it&#x27;ll fight and it&#x27;ll take on people.&quot;

On 8 April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in his maternal grandfather&#x27;s native Malta, Carragher sent a message of encouragement to the Maltese people.

<text>Nekromantik (stylized as NEKRomantik) is a 1987 West German erotic exploitation horror film co-written and directed by Jörg Buttgereit. It is known to be frequently controversial, banned in a number of countries, and has become a cult film over the years due to its transgressive subject matter (including necrophilia) and audacious imagery.

==Plot==
Robert Schmadtke is a troubled young man who works for a company that specialises in cleaning up public spaces after traffic accidents and other fatal incidents; a job which allows Robert to indulge in and explore his necrophilia fetishes, which are shared by his wife Betty. Their apartment is decorated with centerfolds featuring models, pictures of famed killers, and jars containing human parts, which are preserved in formaldehyde.

One day, the street cleaning agency is called to deal with the body of a man found dead in a lake. Robert becomes fascinated upon seeing the man&#x27;s heavily-decayed corpse, and secretly takes it home with him, whereupon he presents it as a gift for Betty. Excited, they both cut off part of a wooden chair leg, before sticking it onto the corpse&#x27;s crotch and putting a condom over it, allowing Betty to use it as a makeshift phallus. Betty then commits necrophilia with the corpse. 

The next day, Robert is confronted at work by his co-workers, and ends up getting fired due to his habitual tardiness and the odour festering from the suit in his locker. He returns home and informs Betty of his termination, upon which she angrily chastises him before leaving and taking the corpse with her. Robert suffers an emotional breakdown and kills their pet cat, before bathing with its entrails.

Robert drinks some whiskey and takes some pills, before falling asleep and experiencing a dream of him being a partially decayed corpse, playing with a decayed severed head alongside a girl dressed in white. After waking up, it is nighttime, and Robert leaves his apartment to hire a gigolette. They go to a cemetery, where he hopes the environment will help satisfy his libido, but he fails to perform sexually. After the gigolette mocks him, he strangles her to death in a fit of rage and then has sex with her corpse. The next morning, Robert is startled by an old gravedigger who stumbles across them. Robert quickly grabs the gravedigger&#x27;s shovel and decapitates him with it before fleeing back to his apartment, where he commits suicide by stabbing himself in the stomach, whilst simulatenously ejaculating. Some time later, an unseen figure in high heels is shown digging up Robert&#x27;s grave.

==Production==
===Development===
This was the first feature-length film directed by Buttgereit who had previously only done featurettes in Super 8 format. Buttgereit and co-writer Franz Rodenkirchen conceived the basic concept of the film while discussing the relationship between love, sex, and death. The idea to connect an orgasm to the moment of death, somebody actually enjoying his own death, was part of their initial ideas.

===Filming===
The film was a no budget film, with inexpensive special effects. The film makes use of actual animal intestines and the eyeballs of pigs. The rabbit-related scene uses documentary-style footage of a professional rabbit breeder at work.

===Music===
The original musical score for the film was composed by Hermann Kopp, Bernd Daktari Lorenz and John Boy Walton.

==Analysis==
According to Bartlomiej Paszylk, the film revealed its roots in amateur film techniques through the use of poor acting and inferior cinematography. What actually made it a &quot;must-see&quot; for horror fans were its taboo-breaking scenes and dwelling on filthy, disgusting subjects. According to Kris Vander Lugt, in terms of genre &quot;Nekromantik&quot; is a mix of elements from several genres: splatter film, &quot;schlock&quot; film, black comedy, exploitation film, and softcore pornography. The title itself implies a mix of death (necro-) and romance. The film then serves as both an ode to necrophilia and an attack on the perceptions of morality of the bourgeoisie.

Other than his hobby of collecting specimens from corpses, Rob is depicted as a typical member of the German working class. On the other hand, the company which employs him has fascist allusions in its naming and emblem. When Rob loses his job, his romance with Betty also ends. She berates him for his lack of both money and manliness. Then she abandons him, introducing the themes of emotional and financial impotence.

Several times in the film, the exterior of the apartment of Rob and Betty is depicted from a streetview. This unexceptional exterior is contrasted with the grotesque scenes taking place behind its walls. Linnie Blake argues this is an evocation of the uncanny in Freudian terms. Rob owns a miniature version of &quot;The Glass Man&quot;. Created in 1930 by Franz Tschackert, it was a life-sized model of a male figure with transparent skin, making visible the skeleton and several internal organs. The placement of this artifact, along with specimen jars in the apartment, makes it seem like a mad scientist&#x27;s laboratory.

Linnie Blake finds it telling that the murderer of the young gardener is previously seen shooting at birds, and is so similar to characters from the Heimatfilms. This was an essentially conservative West German genre which depicted &quot;morally unimpeachable family and community lives&quot;. She argues that Buttgereit both evokes and derides this genre, and by implication the culture which produced it. The supposedly upstanding member of society kills, hides a corpse, and then disappears from view, getting away with murder.

The film includes several occasions of a dream sequence, such as Rob&#x27;s visions of a woman in white in a rural landscape. She transports a severed head in a box and later plays with it.

The film within a film is a slasher film. While a knife-wielding killer traces his knife across a female victim, the desensitized audience of the movie theater seems bored. They kiss or fondle each other, they eat or talk during a misogynist torture scene, a testament to their lack of empathy.

The suicide scene is a depiction of extreme masochism, but it also concludes the story of the character&#x27;s sexual dysfunction, existential crisis, and social isolation. Rob is not only a person with a fetish of the dead, but one who constantly fails in his relationships with the living.

==Release==
&quot;NEKRomantik&quot; defied the censorship standards of West Germany. Since 1984, all horror films released in West Germany have been edited to remove violent scenes, both in cinema release and video release (such as with the 1985 film &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;), while a total of 32 films were banned from release in any format, including &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981). The creators of &quot;Nekromantik&quot; did not submit the film for review by the Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft and made the film available exclusively to an adult audience.

==Home media==
The film was released on Blu-ray by Cult Films on a limited run of 10,000 copies on 7 October 2014.

==Reception==

The film critics of Berlin were typically favourable to the film, commenting on its taboo-breaking, its artistic merit, and the quality of its special effects. A magazine article on &quot;Sex and Death in the Modern Gay Cinema&quot; perceived a film as an allegory for AIDS and the necessity of safe sex.

The film initially faced no significant reprisals. It was only the scandal over the sequel &quot;Nekromantik 2&quot; (1991) which caused the German authorities to temporarily ban sales by mail order of the original film.

John Waters proclaimed &quot;Nekromantik&quot; &quot;the first ever erotic film for necrophiliacs&quot;.

===Controversy===
The film is currently banned outright in Iceland, Malaysia, Singapore, and the provinces of Nova Scotia and Ontario in Canada. In 1992, the Australian Classification Board banned the film outright in Australia due to &quot;graphic necrophilia content&quot;. In 1993, the film was banned in Finland. The film was banned outright by the New Zealand Office of Film and Literature Classification in 1999 due to &quot;revolting, objectionable content (necrophilia, high impact violence, animal cruelty and abhorrent behavior)&quot;. The film is banned in a number of other countries as well. In 2014, the British Board of Film Classification passed the film uncut with an 18 certificate.

==Legacy==

The film spawned a sequel three years later, &quot;Nekromantik 2&quot;, by the same director. Beatrice Manowski reprised her role as Betty as the main character of the film.

Spanish goregrind band Haemorrhage used the film&#x27;s opening theme as an introduction in their album &quot;Emetic Cult&quot;.

Norwegian black metal band Carpathian Forest covered the film&#x27;s opening theme in their album &quot;Strange Old Brew&quot;.

Danish psychobilly band Nekromantix is named after the film.

<doc id="1012025" wikidata="Q1649936" url="?curid=1012025" title="God Shuffled His Feet">
<text>God Shuffled His Feet is the second album by Canadian band Crash Test Dummies, released in 1993. It features their most popular single, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;. The cover art superimposes the band members&#x27; faces over the figures of Titian&#x27;s painting &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot;. It was their most successful album commercially, as it sold over eight million copies worldwide.

==Reception==
The album was the band&#x27;s biggest mainstream hit. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes the album&#x27;s success to &quot;Jerry Harrison&#x27;s remarkably clear and focused production&quot; and that &quot;apart from the relatively concise pop smarts of the singles &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; and &quot;Afternoons and Coffeespoons,&quot; &quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot; isn&#x27;t all that different from the band&#x27;s first album.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot; was a number-one album in Austria and New Zealand, and also reached the top five in the national albums charts of numerous countries such as Australia, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In addition, the album reached number six in the Netherlands national albums chart, number two in the UK Albums Chart, and number nine in the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. In their native Canada, it never reached higher than number 11 on the national charts, but fueled by the success of its four singles (all Top 20 hits there) the album eventually reached triple platinum status.

<text>The 2004 Summer Paralympics, officially known as the Games of the XII Paralympics, were an international summer multi-parasport event for athletes with disabilities governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) held in Athens, Greece from 17 to 28 September 2004. Greece hosted a Paralympic Games for the first time, and it was also the 12th Paralympic Games in history. A total of 3,806 athletes representing 136 National Paralympic Committees (NPC) participated, and 17 NPCs made their Paralympic debuts in Athens. The Games featured 519 events in 19 sports across 20 disciplines, including the Paralympic debut of football 5-a-side. 

Athletes from 75 countries had won at least one medal, leaving 61 nations without a medal. Angola, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Cyprus, Iraq, Latvia, Morocco, Serbia and Montenegro, and Turkey won their nation&#x27;s first Paralympic gold medals. They were also the first Paralympic medals of any kind for Angola, Botswana, Cyprus, Macedonia, Rwanda, Serbia and Montenegro, and Turkey. The official medal was created and cut by designer Konstantinos Kazakos. It features an engraving of the Parthenon on top of the Acropolis as well as the Games&#x27; name in Greek above it. The reverse face shows the Games&#x27; logo above its name. Below that are three Tae-Geuks as well as the phrase &quot;Athens 2004&quot; in braille.

China led the medal table both in number of gold medals won and in overall medals, with 63 and 141 respectively. It was the first time that the nation led the medal count in overall medals won. Among individual participants, Japan&#x27;s Mayumi Narita and the United States&#x27;s Erin Popovich won the most gold medals at the Games with seven each in swimming. Canada&#x27;s Stephanie Dixon (one gold, six silver and one bronze), Belarus&#x27;s Raman Makarau (three gold, three silver and two bronze) and Narita (seven gold and one bronze) won the most overall medals at the Games with eight each in total.

==Medal table==
The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the IPC and is consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a &quot;nation&quot; is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee). The number of silver medals is next considered, followed by the number of bronze medals. If nations remain tied, they are ranked equally and listed alphabetically by IPC country code.

In the mixed dressage championship Grade II Individual event, there was a tie for third place which resulted in two bronze medals being issued. In the women&#x27;s table tennis class 1–3 team competition, only a gold medal was awarded to the winning team.

<doc id="1012028" wikidata="Q4865480" url="?curid=1012028" title="Bartok (card game)">
<text>The game of Bartok, also known by a number of other names, such as Wartoke, Warthog, Bartog, Bentok, Last One Standing or Bong 98, is a card game popular in Australia where the winner of each round invents a new rule which must be obeyed for the remainder of the game. It belongs to the &quot;shedding&quot; or Eights family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid themselves of all of their cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules.

==Gameplay==
The game of Bartok consists of several rounds of play. The winner of each round creates a new rule which remains in play for future rounds of the game.

The players sit in a circle and the cards are placed face down in the center and mixed. Each player then picks up either five or seven cards, by agreement. A single card is then flipped to face up to start the discard pile. The rest of the face down cards form the draw pile. Any player may then play on that card, providing such a play is legal. One of the players to the left or right of that person then plays, to determine the direction of play. It is also possible to use a dealer, who deals the cards to each player in the usual manner. In this case, play follows to the left of the dealer.

In the first round, a player may discard a card face up on the discard pile which has either the same suit or face value of the top card of the discard pile. At that point, play moves on to the next player. Plays must be made in a timely manner or face a penalty. If a player cannot or does not wish to make a legal play, they instead pick up a card from the draw pile, and this also ends their turn. In some games, if a player has just drawn a card to end their turn which &quot;could have&quot; legally been played, they may jump in with that card before the next player has played.

A round ends when any player has no cards left. That player is declared the winner of the round and is permitted to create a new rule for the next round. If a player has only one card left, they must say &quot;Bartok&quot; or receive a penalty. This applies even if a player gets down to one card by non-standard means, such as trading hands with someone else. If the draw pile runs out before a round ends, all but the top card of the discard pile is flipped over to form the new draw pile. The game usually ends when several rules combine to make continued play impossible.

The game has no overall winner or ending condition, only a series of winners of each round.

===Creating new rules===
New rules are introduced to Bartok by the winner of each round, making the game more complex as it progresses. The creator must tell the other players what this rule is. Rules cannot be specific to particular players (such as &quot;skip Bill every turn&quot;) and cannot remove or alter a rule introduced in a previous round, unless that is the wish of every player. Additionally, if there is a unanimous veto, that is, &quot;every&quot; player bar the creator vetoes a new rule, then the rule is not used and the creator must think of another. Commonly, there is a time out rule, whereby if players need clarification during a round of a newly introduced rule, they may call time out and discuss it.

Almost all rules are of the form &quot;if (trigger) then (consequence)&quot;, for example &quot;If a 7 is played, reverse the direction of play.&quot; Common triggers include the ranks, faces and colours of played cards (and how those values relate to the current top card), and changes between suits and parities (odd to even, even to odd), but they may also be triggered by non-card events such as speaking (or failing to speak) a certain word when playing a card. Consequences are often simply &quot;this card may not be played&quot;, but may alternatively include the drawing of extra cards, the swapping of cards between players&#x27; hands, and alterations to the turn sequence. Bartok can be made into a drinking game if the consequence of a play is that a player must take a drink.

Many rules can be made cumulative. For example, &quot;If a 7 is played, the next player picks up two cards and forfeits their turn or plays another 7. If they play another 7, the player after them picks up 4 cards and forfeits their turn or plays another 7, etc.&quot; Generally, it is desirable to have the more complex rules on a rarer trigger so that the players are not overly taxed by any one rule. The very best rules are creative, playable and fun.

===Penalties===
A penalty of one card is awarded for a number of illegal actions in Bartok. Anyone may award penalties in Bartok, although only one penalty may be awarded to a player for any given action, so if two people simultaneously accuse player X of the same action, only one of the penalties holds. Penalties do not end a player&#x27;s turn. For example, if awarded a &quot;Too Slow&quot; penalty the player must still either play or pick up. Below is a typical list of penalties.

*&quot;Question&quot;: For a player who asks a question or started to ask a question. It does not matter if the question is relevant to the game or not. Sometimes this penalty may be dealt to an observer not playing the game - thus immediately involving them in the game.
*&quot;Incorrect Play&quot;: For a player who plays illegally during their turn.
*&quot;Out of Turn&quot;: For a player who plays when it is not their turn.
*&quot;Too Slow&quot;: For a player who does not play in a timely manner. This penalty can be issued multiple times during one turn if the player is extraordinarily slow. As a rough guide, leave about 3 seconds between each &quot;Too Slow&quot; issued.
*&quot;Failure to say &quot;Bartok&quot;&quot;: For a player who has only one card left but has not said &quot;Bartok&quot;. In many circles, these are issued very quickly after the player reaches one card, since they should say &quot;Bartok&quot; directly after playing their last card. If a player wins the round without saying &quot;Bartok&quot; and without being caught, they still win the round. The penalty is not awarded retroactively.
*&quot;False Accusation&quot;: For a player who accuses another player of a penalty incorrectly.

==Mao==
As with other combination shedding and guessing games such as Mao, the rules can become quite complex. The similarity between Mao and Bartok is such that the two games are sometimes referred to by the other&#x27;s name. The principal difference is that in Mao, a substantial set of rules is maintained between games, whereas in Bartok, this is only true of the minimal initial set of rules. Further, in those variants of Mao where rules are added between rounds, those rules are usually added silently and must be deduced by other players, whereas in Bartok the new rules are told to everyone. This allows the rules of Bartok to be substantially more technical than the rules of Mao, since the details of the rules can be discussed.

<doc id="1012030" wikidata="Q887852" url="?curid=1012030" title="Bob Clement">
<text>Robert Nelson Clement (born September 23, 1943) is an American politician and academic administrator. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for Tennessee&#x27;s 5th congressional district from 1988 until 2003.

The son of Tennessee Governor Frank G. Clement, Clement had served on the board of directors at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and as president of Cumberland University before entering Congress. Earlier in his career, he was a member of the Tennessee Public Service Commission. Clement retired from the House to mount an unsuccessful candidacy for the United States Senate in 2002.

==Early life and education==
Clement is the son of former Tennessee Governor Frank G. Clement. During his father&#x27;s third run for governor in 1962, he joined his father on the campaign trail, often making speeches when his father developed throat trouble.

Clement graduated from Hillsboro High School in Nashville. He went on to attend the University of Tennessee graduating in 1967. He served in the National Guard from 1969 to 1971 and also served in the reserves until 2001, retiring as a colonel.

== Early career ==

=== Tennessee Public Service Commission ===
Clement considered buying a telephone company while he was studying at the University of Tennessee, but his father would not lend him the money. He gained knowledge about the Tennessee Public Service Commission, which was tasked with regulating phone companies and other utilities. Clement then became interested in working for the commission&#x27;s staff.

In 1972, Clement ran against Hammond Fowler in the Democratic primary for the incumbent&#x27;s seat and won. He won by a 3 to 1 margin which was the most lopsided defeat of a statewide incumbent in Tennessee history. He went on to win against Republican nominee Tom Garland in the general election in what was otherwise largely a good year for Republican candidates in Tennessee. (No Republican was ever elected to the Public Service Commission in the state during its existence which later played a factor in its abolition in 1996. At 29 he was (and still is) the youngest person ever elected to statewide office in Tennessee history.

=== Gubernatorial candidacy and TVA board membership ===
In 1978, Clement ran for the Democratic nomination for governor. He ran second in the primary narrowly behind Knoxville banker Jake Butcher, who had finished second in the Democratic gubernatorial primary four years previously.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter tapped him for an unexpired term on the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). He tried to stop the overbuilding of nuclear reactors in the TVA service area, later telling &quot;The (Nashville) Tennessean&quot; that the agency was trying to pay for the projects by raising rates when there was plenty of power available. He stepped down in 1981.

==Congressional career==
In 1982, Clement announced his candidacy for the 7th Congressional District, his family&#x27;s home district. The seat was being vacated by five-term incumbent Republican Robin Beard, who was leaving it to run against Senator Jim Sasser, and had been renumbered from the 6th in redistricting. Clement won the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election to Don Sundquist, a businessman from Memphis who would later become a two-term governor. It was the first (and as of the 2010 elections, only) time that a Democrat had come within single digits in the 7th District and its predecessors since it fell into Republican hands in 1972. Clement said years later that he&#x27;d made a mistake by trying to run the same kind of campaign that his father had in his glory days.

Temporarily out of politics, Clement remained active in Democratic circles. He also had a large network of contacts through his ongoing service in the National Guard. In 1983, Clement became president of Cumberland University, a struggling private junior college in Lebanon, east of Nashville. Cumberland had once been one of the most prestigious universities in the South, but had fallen upon hard times, never fully recovering from the Great Depression and the widespread availability of lower-cost public higher education after World War II. The nadir probably occurred when it was forced, for financial reasons, to sell its once-renowned law school (which Clement&#x27;s father had attended) to what is now Samford University in Birmingham and downgrade to a junior college. During Clement&#x27;s tenure, the school regained four-year college status, and shortly later, full university status. He also tripled the school&#x27;s private donations.

In 1987, 5th District Congressman Bill Boner left his House seat to become mayor of Nashville. Clement, who had moved to Nashville by this time, resigned as president of Cumberland on August 22 to run in the Democratic primary for the balance of Boner&#x27;s term. He won the nomination over a crowded field, including most prominently Phil Bredesen, future mayor of Nashville and two-term governor of Tennessee, who finished second. As the Republicans had long since lost interest in a seat they hadn&#x27;t won since 1875 (Democrats have faced only token opposition since 1972), Clement&#x27;s victory in the special election of January 19, 1988 was a foregone conclusion. He took office that night, as soon as the results were certified. He was unopposed for a full term in November even as George H. W. Bush became only the second Republican to carry Nashville in a presidential election. He was reelected six times with no substantial opposition.

Despite representing one of the most Democratic districts in the country, Clement had a reputation for working across party lines. This nonpartisan style dated back to his first campaign for the Public Service Commission.

On October 10, 2002, Bob Clement was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

==2002 U.S. Senate bid==
In 2002, when Republican Senator Fred Thompson stated that he had changed his mind regarding his previous announcement that he would run for a second full term, Clement entered the Democratic primary for Thompson&#x27;s seat. He won the nomination easily, but was defeated in the November general election by former governor Lamar Alexander. Clement was succeeded in the House by former Congressman Jim Cooper, who is also a son of a former Tennessee governor.

== Post-congressional career ==
Clement received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Public Transit Association in 2023. Clements run a Nashville-based firm, Clement &amp; Associates, that consults on policy issues related to energy, health, and education.

=== 2006 mayoral candidacy ===
On February 15, 2006, Clement formed an exploratory committee for a possible run for mayor of Metropolitan Nashville/Davidson County in 2007. His supporters launched a campaign website well before his official announcement. Clement finished second in a crowded field including five major candidates, where the top three candidates finished only a few hundred votes apart. Clement faced former Metropolitan Nashville/Davidson County law department director Karl Dean in a runoff election on September 11, 2007.

Clement lost the election to Dean by a 52% (51,946) to 48% (47,347) margin.
Clement stated after the results were tallied that he had no plans to run for public office in the future.

==Personal life==

Clement is married to the former Mary Carson of Nashville. They have two children and Clement has two stepchildren.

Clement currently works as a realtor in Nashville and serves on the board of directors of the Clement Railroad Hotel Museum in Dickson, Tennessee. The museum is dedicated to the history of Dickson County, Tennessee as well as the life and legacy of Clement’s father, Governor Frank G. Clement, who was born in the museum (back when it was the Hotel Halbrook) on June 2, 1920.

Ralston served as assistant manager at several teams, including the Houston Dynamo and San Jose Earthquakes, including a brief stint as the interim head coach at the Earthquakes in 2018.

==Club career==
Ralston was drafted 18th overall in the 1996 MLS College Draft by the Tampa Bay Mutiny out of Florida International University, and quickly established himself as one of the best players in the league, starting 31 matches in the club&#x27;s inaugural campaign, scoring seven goals and notching two assists, and concluding the year as the first player in MLS history to win the Rookie of the Year Award. He also helped the club lift the first-ever Supporters&#x27; Shield. In his second season, Ralston started 29 matches and scored five goals, adding 11 assists. He was named to the 1997 MLS All-Star team. He started 29 matches in 1998, again scoring five goals, and recording eight assists. In 1999, Ralston was voted Mutiny Team MVP, MLS Best XI, and won the MLS Fair Play Award. He started all 32 matches for the club, scoring five goals and recording a league-leading eighteen assists. In 2000, Ralston was named an MLS All-Star for the second time, won the MLS Fair Play Award for the second time, and finished second in the league in assists, with 17. In total, Ralston played for the Mutiny for six years, leaving only after the team was contracted in 2002. Ralston departed as the Mutiny as the club&#x27;s all-time leader in games played (177) and points (130).

On January 11, 2002, Ralston was selected by the New England Revolution in the 2002 Allocation Draft. In his first year with the Revolution, Ralston led the league in assists with 19. He was named MLS Best XI for the second time, and an MLS All-Star for the third time. He helped the team reach the MLS Cup final for the first time, ultimately losing to the LA Galaxy on a Golden Goal in extra time.

Ralston was named an MLS All-Star in 2004, and won goal of the week twice - in week 15 and 19. He was subsequently a finalist for MLS Goal of the Year, and was named Revolution Team MVP. In 2006, Ralston was a finalist for the MLS Fair Play Award. He was again named an MLS All-Star in 2007, and led the league in assists, with 14. On July 14, 2007 against the New York Red Bulls, Ralston surpassed his former teammate Carlos Valderrama to become the MLS all-time leader in assists, with 115. In 2007 Ralston also helped the club win its first-ever silverware in the form of the 2007 U.S. Open Cup.

In 2008, Ralston was named MLS Player of the Week twice - in matchweeks four and five. He was named an MLS All-Star for the sixth time. He also won the Revolution team Golden Boot award, scoring eight goals and recording seven assists. That year he helped the club secure its second-ever piece of silverware, the 2008 North American SuperLiga, scoring in the final and converting a penalty during the subsequent shoot-out. In 2009 Ralston won the MLS Fair Play Award, and was named Revolution Humanitarian of the Year. He suffered a season-ending knee injury in September of the 2009 season.

Ralston&#x27;s contract with the Revolution ended at the conclusion of the 2009 season, and he left the club to become the first-ever signing of new USSF Division 2 club AC St. Louis. Ralston was one of the team&#x27;s starting midfielders, and an assistant coach to head coach Claude Anelka.

After AC St. Louis ran in to financial difficulties, Ralston agreed to leave by mutual consent and immediately joined up with his former club New England Revolution.

In Ralston&#x27;s first appearance back with the New England Revolution, he suffered a left elbow dislocation. In July 2010, he announced his retirement.

Ralston ended his Major League Soccer career as the league&#x27;s leader in minutes played (33,143), games started (372), appearances (378), and assists (135). In thirteen years in the league, he scored 76 goals and had 135 assists in 378 regular season matches, and added three goals and seven assists in 30 playoff matches. He also served as captain for several seasons with New England, from 2007-2009.

==International career==
Ralston appeared for the United States national team 36 times over an 11-year span and scored 4 international goals. His first cap came on January 17, 1997, against Peru. His last was for the squad that won the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He was never selected to a World Cup roster.

Ralston had a break out year for the United States national team in 2005 by earning 15 caps. He scored the game-winning goal in a World Cup qualifying match against Mexico on September 3, 2005. The victory for the United States clinched qualification in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Due to a later injury, he was only listed as an alternate for the United States at the World Cup.

== Coaching career ==
In July 2010, Ralston took an assistant coaching job at the Houston Dynamo with his former Mutiny teammate Dominic Kinnear. On January 6, 2015, the San Jose Earthquakes announced Ralston would join Kinnear in San Jose and once again serve as his assistant coach.

<text>IBC Root Beer is an American brand of root beer now owned by Keurig Dr Pepper. It was originally owned by IBC until it went out of business.

== Independent Breweries Company ==
The Independent Breweries Company is a defunct syndicate founded in St. Louis, Missouri, by the combination of Griesediecks&#x27; National Brewery, Columbia (Alpen Brau), the Gast brewery in Baden, A.B.C., and Wagner Brewing Company. This combination was ill fated due to high overhead with too many executives and low profits forcing IBC into receivership. The IBC Root Beer was the main survivor of the syndicate.

== Root beer ==

IBC Root Beer was founded in 1919 by the Griesedieck family as the Independent Breweries Company in St. Louis, Missouri. Root beer found a market as a legal beverage during the era of Prohibition. The Independent Breweries Company closed, but the trademark was purchased by the Kranzberg family, which operated the Northwestern Bottling Company. In the late 1930s, it was sold to the National Bottling Company, owned by the Shucart family. Popularity and distribution declined after World War II.

In 1976, the IBC trademark was sold to Taylor Beverages, which was then sold to the Seven-Up Company in 1980. After Dr Pepper and 7 Up merged in 1986, distribution of IBC spread across the United States. Dr Pepper/Seven Up was acquired by Cadbury Schweppes in 1995.

In July 2016, IBC reformulated its beverages, using cane sugar in place of high-fructose corn syrup. The bottles are now distributed in four-bottle packs (instead of the original six), and no longer have the IBC logo formed into the bottle itself, but rather printed on a plain brown bottle. This change has also resulted in increase in average price per bottle.

== Flavors ==

In 2020:
* IBC Root Beer
* IBC Diet Root Beer
* IBC Cream Soda
* IBC Black Cherry

<doc id="1012044" wikidata="Q183468" url="?curid=1012044" title="Kazakhstan national football team">
<text>The Kazakhstan national football team (, , ) represents Kazakhstan in men&#x27;s international football and it is governed by the Kazakhstan Football Federation. They split from the Soviet Union national team after independence in 1991 and joined the Asian Football Confederation&#x27;s Central Asian Football Federation. After failing to qualify for the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, they joined UEFA, but are yet to qualify for a FIFA World Cup or a UEFA European Championship.

==History==

===AFC member (1992–2002)===
The country of Kazakhstan declared independence from the Soviet Union on 16 December 1991. Its national team then split from the Soviet Union national team (a UEFA member) and joined the Asian Football Confederation. At the time, they were one of strongest teams in Central Asia, and one of the most improving teams in Asia.

The team played their first match against another former-Soviet debutant, Turkmenistan, on 1 June 1992, as part of a Central Asian tournament. Kazakhstan won 1–0. The tournament also saw the footballing debuts of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. After beating Libya in a friendly in North Korea on 3 July, Kazakhstan played the remainder of its Central Asian fixtures and avoided defeat in all of them. They beat Uzbekistan 1–0 at home on 16 July, then drew 1–1 away in Turkmenistan on 14 September, in Kyrgyzstan on 26 September and Uzbekistan on 14 October. The final match was a 2–0 home victory over Kyrgyzstan on 25 October.

Kazakhstan entered qualification for the first time in the attempt to reach the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In the first round they were placed in Group 9 alongside Pakistan and Iraq. Kazakhstan&#x27;s first qualifying match was won 3–0 at home in Almaty on 11 May 1997, against Pakistan. On 6 June they travelled to Baghdad to face Iraq and won 2–1, then five days later won an away match against Pakistan, 7–0 in Lahore. The result remains Kazakhstan&#x27;s biggest-ever international win. They retained their 100% start to World Cup football by beating Iraq at home 3–1 on 29 June.

In the second and final round of qualification, Kazakhstan came last in the group. Their only victory was on 18 October 1997, when they beat the United Arab Emirates 3–0 at home. Kazakhstan drew three other games – all at home (versus Uzbekistan, Japan and South Korea).

In the first round of Asian qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Kazakhstan were placed in Group 6 alongside Iraq, Nepal and Macau. All games in the group were to be held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, after Nepal failed to organise matches in Kathmandu in March 2001. After an Iraqi protest, the first three games for each team were moved to Baghdad, Iraq.

Kazakhstan started off well in Baghdad by beating Nepal 6–0 with two goals by Oleg Litvinenko on 12 April, and Macau 3–0 two days later. On 16 April they held Iraq to a 1–1 draw in front of 50,000 spectators. Ruslan Baltiev put the Kazakhs in front in the 6th minute and Abdul-Wahab Abu Al-Hail equalised with a penalty in the 31st.

In Almaty Central Stadium, Kazakhstan beat Nepal 3–0 with two goals by Maksim Igorevich Shevchenko on 21 April. Two days later they beat Macau 5–0, Dmitriy Byakov and Igor Avdeyev each scored twice after a goalless first half. The final game on 25 April saw a 1–1 draw against Iraq in front of a 25,000-strong crowd. Litvinenko put Kazakhstan ahead in the 32nd minute but Iraq equalised ten minutes later. Despite being level on points, Iraq advanced on goal difference mainly due to a 9–1 victory over Nepal.

===UEFA member (2002–present)===


Being a transcontinental country, Kazakhstan joined UEFA in 2002. They had to wait until the 2002 FIFA World Cup finished on 30 June before making the switch, as they had entered the tournament as an AFC member. Kazakhstan therefore could not enter qualification for UEFA Euro 2004, as the draw had been made on 25 January 2002. Since joining UEFA, Kazakhstan has been a relative minnow within the continent, with most of their qualifications being unsuccessful and often finish near dead last or bottom.

In the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, now as members of UEFA, Kazakhstan was placed in the last drawing pot with Andorra and Luxembourg, being placed in Group 2 alongside Turkey, Denmark, future UEFA Euro 2004 winners Greece, Ukraine, Georgia and Albania.

Their first official UEFA match was on 8 September 2004 and ended in a home defeat by 2–1 against Ukraine. Kazakhstan lost their next 9 matches, including a 6–0 home defeat against Turkey, their tied-biggest defeat up to 2018 and conceding a home defeat to Greece into four minutes of the stoppage time. Their sole point of the qualifying came in the next match, on 8 October 2005, in a 0–0 away draw against Georgia played behind closed doors, before losing the last match at home against Denmark.

For the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, Kazakhstan was once again placed in the last drawing pot. Their campaign started with two away draws against Belgium (0–0) and Azerbaijan (1–1). They lost the next three matches before getting their first official win as UEFA members in a 2–1 home triumph against Serbia with goals from Kairat Ashirbekov and Nurbol Zhumaskaliyev. After a home loss against Armenia, Kazakhstan got their sixth and seventh points after drawing again with Azerbaijan (1–1) and Belgium (2–2), both at home. Losses against Poland and Portugal were followed by their second win, this time away from home, with Sergei Ostapenko scoring the winning goal against Armenia. Their last match was a delayed game against Serbia, ending in defeat. In the end, Kazakhstan finished with 10 points and placed 6th out of the 8 Group A teams.

The 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification had Kazakhstan in the 5th of 6 drawing pots, drawn in Group 6 with Croatia, England, Ukraine, Belarus and Andorra. They started the campaign with a 3–0 home win against Andorra on 20 August 2008. However, that was the only opponent they managed to get points from, after they won the reverse fixture 3–1 on 9 September 2009 and lost all the other group matches. Kazakhstan finished 5th, ahead only of Andorra, who lost all of their matches.

Kazakhstan was drawn in the Group A of the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying and lost the first five matches without managing to score a single goal before defeating Azerbaijan on 3 June 2011 by 2–1 with two goals from Sergey Gridin. They lost their next three games before ending the qualifying with a goalless home draw against Austria. They ended in the last place with 4 points, three behind Azerbaijan.

Following recent unimpressive qualifying campaigns, Kazakhstan was once again in the last drawing pot for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. Their campaign in Group C started with two defeats before getting their first point in a goalless home draw against Austria on 12 October 2012. Losses to Austria and twice to Germany were followed by their first and only win of the qualification by 2–1 against Faroe Islands on 6 September 2013. They still got a fifth point in a 1–1 away drawn against the same opponents. Kazakhstan finished in 5th place, ahead only of the Faroese.

The UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying had Kazakhstan once more in the last drawing pot. Their first match was a home 0–0 draw against Latvia on 9 September 2014, followed by six consecutive losses before another goalless draw, away from home, against Iceland. After their seventh defeat of the qualifying, Kazakhstan ended the campaign with a 1–0 away win against Latvia on 13 October 2015. The goal scored by Islambek Kuat got the Kazakhs the 5th place, tied in points with the Latvians, but with a better head-to-head record.

Once again in the last drawing pot, Kazakhstan had an unimpressive 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, failing to win a single match. After two home draws against Poland and Romania in their first three matches, Kazakhstan lost their following six matches, ending the qualifying with a 1–1 home draw against Armenia and finishing last in Group E.

For the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, Kazakhstan was in Pot 3 of League D, the fourth and lowest division of the UEFA Nations League. Drawn in Group 1 with Georgia, Latvia and Andorra, their campaign started with a 2–0 home loss against group winners Georgia. Away draws against Andorra and Latvia had Georgia with 9 points after the three first matches, with all the other teams tied with 2 points. Kazakhstan defeated Andorra by 4–0 on 16 October, but the Georgia win against Latvia got the Georgians promoted to League C with two matches still to be played. Their sixth and last point came in a 1–1 home draw against Latvia, before being defeated by Georgia in the last group match and finishing in the second place of the group.

The UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying for Kazakhstan was unsuccessful again. However, Kazakhstan won ten points in the qualification, its best performance to date in Euro qualifying, including a shock 3–0 home win over Scotland, and a 1–1 away draw over Cyprus, though they still finished fifth at the end.

Kazakhstan played the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying at home against Slovenia, which they lost 2–1. In their next game against Denmark, Kazakhstan came from 2–0 down to win 3–2 in the last minutes of the match. Kazakhstan won a late victory away at Northern Ireland on 19 June 2023, with Abat Aimbetov scoring in the 88th minute from a breakaway goal. Kazakhstan remained in contention for an automatic qualification berth throughout the campaign, only losing out on the final round due to a 2–1 away defeat to Slovenia. Regardless, Kazakhstan had their best qualifying campaign to date as a UEFA member by progressing into the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs. However, their most successful campaign ended with a 5–0 defeat against Greece in the play-offs semi-finals.

==Rivalries==
Though currently an UEFA member, Kazakhstan&#x27;s best rivalries are mostly with AFC members from Central Asia, namely Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. The Hawks&#x27; two biggest rivals are Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, which dates back from early USSR rule. These rivalries are still of great importance for many Kazakhs, since Kazakhstan does not have any real rivalry with any UEFA national team.

<doc id="1012051" wikidata="Q460125" url="?curid=1012051" title="Ambush Bug">
<text>Ambush Bug is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. His real name is supposedly Irwin Schwab, but he has mental problems that prevent him from truly understanding reality around him, so even his true identity might be no more than a delusion on his part. His origin is disputed, although the most commonly accepted origin is that Brum-El (a historical allusion to Beau Brummell, as well as a reference to Superman&#x27;s father Jor-El) of the planet Schwab sent his clothes from his supposedly doomed planet, hoping that his wardrobe would survive, only to have it intercepted by a giant radioactive space spider. In the resulting crash, only two articles of clothing survived: the Ambush Bug suit, which was subsequently found by Irwin Schwab; and &quot;Argh!Yle!&quot;, an argyle sock with a Doctor Doom-like complex, complete with metal mask.

==Publication history==
Created by artist Keith Giffen as an intentionally silly character, Ambush Bug first appeared in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #52 (Dec. 1982) and would make appearances in several other Superman-related comic books in the early 1980s. Paul Kupperberg, who wrote Ambush Bug&#x27;s first story, recalled, &quot;as Keith was in the office, he sat in on the plotting and offered up Ambush Bug as an antagonist. The Bug is entirely Keith&#x27;s creation ...&quot; Giffen has stated that both Ambush Bug and Lobo were derived from Lunatik, a character he created in high school. Giffen said that his original pitch was &quot;Bugs Bunny as a super-villain&quot;.

In response to positive reader reaction to the character&#x27;s first appearance, editor Julius Schwartz directed Giffen to create another Ambush Bug story for &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #59. At first, Ambush Bug was a villain, named after a type of insect, and having a green, skintight suit with two orange antennae containing miniature robot bugs that enable him to teleport. After attacking Superman and other heroes, Ambush Bug decides instead to be a superhero as well. He also fancies himself Superman&#x27;s friend, which only annoys the hero even more than his early villainy. The costume then becomes permanently affixed to his body, and he gains the power to teleport by himself. While trying to fix one of the miniature bugs, it explodes, causing a chain reaction and a blast that destroys all of the bugs and tints Ambush Bug&#x27;s costume temporarily black; he then becomes capable of teleporting even without the bugs (briefly considering changing his moniker to Black Beetle instead).

Ambush Bug became popular enough to be featured in two comic book miniseries and several specials, plotted and pencilled by Keith Giffen and scripted by Robert Loren Fleming. The series contains many comic book-enthusiast and DC in-jokes and satire; series editor Julius Schwartz is also a character in the book.

During his own four-part series in 1985, he picks up a doll and, thinking it is alive, &quot;adopted&quot; it as a partner called &quot;Cheeks, The Toy Wonder&quot;, complete with its own costume.

In 2001, Ambush Bug appears as a member of the &quot;Justice League of Anarchy&quot; alongside Plastic Man, the Creeper, Harley Quinn, &#x27;Mazing Man, and the Trickster. This group of DC Universe troublemakers made a one-panel cameo in a series exploring variations on the JLA acronym, &quot;JLA: Justice League of Amazons&quot;.

Ambush Bug is largely considered an absurd character and is rarely used by other writers, though he still exists in the DC Universe and occasionally still appears in some DC Comics. His popularity amongst creators has led to many &quot;cameos&quot;, sometimes with as little as his antennae being visible. In 2006, he appeared as part of Firestorm&#x27;s short-lived Justice League of America in &quot;52&quot; #24 (a comic Giffen did layouts for). His powers appeared in proxy in &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; #32. Jimmy Olsen briefly gains the appearance of Ambush Bug and subconsciously uses his power of &quot;Dumb Luck&quot; to locate Forager.

An Ambush Bug miniseries, &quot;Ambush Bug: Year None&quot;, debuted in 2008, plotted and pencilled by Giffen, and written by Fleming, with Jann Jones serving as editor. The final issue was published almost a year after the rest of the series. Dan DiDio claims to have lost issue #6 and instead they skipped it to finish off with issue #7.

Ambush Bug was seen in the new &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; series in 2010 at the end of issue #9, arriving with his luggage and Cheeks. He appeared semi-regularly until the series ended.

Ambush Bug made another appearance, in issue #46 of the outside of regular DC continuity &quot;Tiny Titans&quot; series.

In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Ambush Bug appears as a news reporter in the feature &quot;Channel 52&quot;, which summarizes the comics&#x27; plots.

==Foes==
===As a villain===
* Superman
* Doom Patrol
* Legion of Substitute Heroes

===As a hero===
* Argh!Yle! - A living argyle sock. The closest thing Ambush Bug has to an archenemy.
* Jonni DC - A &quot;continuity cop&quot; who pursues Ambush Bug for violations of DC Universe canon.
* Interferer - A former comic artist that gained god-like powers that he uses to &quot;perfect&quot; the universe.
* Go Go Chex - A villain from &quot;Earth-6&quot;, where all the characters are stuck in the 1960s. He is themed around the &quot;new look&quot; DC gave all its books with a black and white checker pattern at the top. He speaks a hippy lingo and refers to everyone as &quot;Wonder Chick&quot;, a nickname for Wonder Girl from the Teen Titans of that era.
* E.L.F. - A secret government agency who experimented with Ambush Bug&#x27;s suit to try to discover its secrets.

==Powers and weapons==

Ambush Bug&#x27;s primary power is teleportation. At first, this was a function of his suit; he was limited to teleporting to where small receiver bugs were located. Later, after an explosion, Ambush Bug internalized this power. It became apparent, in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #81, that the Bug used to have to say &quot;Simon says&quot; to teleport, but it is no longer necessary. Ambush Bug is also aware of his fictionality and aware of events in other publishers&#x27; comic books. He once was shown being able to follow the internal dialogue between Firestorm&#x27;s component personalities. Ambush Bug also shows surprising agility and skill at unarmed combat, such as gouging the eyes of enemies attacking him from behind or knocking out members of the Legion of Substitute Heroes with a single blow. His unusual way of thinking is also a great advantage and often allows him to guess opponents&#x27; tactics and outmaneuver them, humiliating them in the process.

<text>The Transitway is a bus rapid transit (BRT) network operated by OC Transpo in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It comprises a series of bus-only roadways and reserved lanes on city streets and highways. The dedicated busways ensure that buses and emergency vehicles on the Transitway rarely intersect directly with regular traffic, making it possible to run quickly and consistently, even during rush hour traffic. OC Transpo operates a network of rapid routes which use the Transitway to connect communities with the O-Train light rail system. Additional bus routes also use segments of the Transitway.

The Transitway opened in 1983 with five stations. The network expanded greatly to include over fifty stations at its peak.

In the 2010s, the central segment of the Transitway began reaching capacity, with buses bumper to bumper. To combat this, segments of the Transitway were closed in 2015 to allow conversion to a higher capacity light rail line, which opened in 2019 as the Confederation Line. More segments of the Transitway have been closed since construction began on Stage 2 of the O-Train expansion, and more will be converted when Stage 3 begins.

Ottawa&#x27;s Transitway has been seen as a prime example of bus rapid transit internationally, and has influenced the design and creation of other systems worldwide. The Ottawa Transitway has also been used as a model for how to design bus rapid transit, such as is the case for Brisbane, Australia and Mississauga, among others.

== Design ==

Most of the Ottawa Transitway is grade separated from other modes of traffic, using trenches and elevated structures to bypass intersections. These parts of the Transitway have access controlled to only allow buses, and are accessed from side streets using ramps. Being controlled access, they have high top speeds of up to 90km/h.

Other parts of the Transitway are at-grade, with signal priority given to buses at intersections. The city also has a large network of bus lanes on major roads, such as Highway 417 and Baseline Road, but it usually doesn&#x27;t consider these a part of the rapid transit network.

All vehicles in Ottawa&#x27;s bus fleet have on-board audio announcements and digital wayfinding. This is typically used to announce next stops, as well as what interchanges and notable destinations are available at that stop.
=== Stations ===

Stations on the Transitway typically have at least four lanes, two for buses stopping at the station, and two for vehicles travelling through the station. Almost all Transitway stations have shelters, and many Transitway stations have live departure boards, pedestrian bridges, and ticket machines. Older Transitway stations use modernist architecture, accented with red features.

== Legacy ==
The Transitway was the first bus rapid transit system of its kind in North America, and has had a significant impact on Ottawa, as well as cities across the world.

On the backs of the Transitway, Ottawa came to be seen as a gold standard for how to provide rapid transit cost effectively, and grew to champion one of the largest public transit mode shares in North America. Locally, the Transitway has come to form the backbone of the city&#x27;s entire multi-modal transportation system, contributing to reducing congestion on the road network, making more of the city accessible to active transportation, and is the catalyst that enabled the current O-Train network. Abroad, the Transitway has created a perception of Ottawa as a &quot;transit success story&quot; in a continent otherwise resistant to taking transit, and is seen as a model for other cities internationally, especially within the United States.

==History==

During the 1970s and 1980s, the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton approved the construction of a new transit corridor called the Transitway. The purpose of this busway was to increase the speed of city-bound services from east and west. The first two sections opened in 1983: the southwestern Transitway between Lincoln Fields and Baseline and the east between Lees and Hurdman.

The central Transitway was then added in the Westboro and Mechanicsville areas. In the downtown core, buses traveled along dedicated lanes on Albert and Slater streets. The eastern Transitway was extended in both directions, towards Laurier in the northwest and Blair in the east. These segments of the Transitway were serviced by route 95, travelling the full length of the Transitway from Baseline to Blair. Priority measures were later added to Woodroffe Avenue and Regional Road 174, extending service into the suburbs of Barrhaven and Orleans.

In the 1990s, a rail corridor was gradually converted into the southeast Transitway, spanning from Hurdman to South Keys. This new section necessitated the creation of route 97. Route 97 followed the new southeast Transitway before joining route 95 along the existing Transitway segments. The 97 was extended to service the suburb of Kanata. The Kanata section was later split off into route 96.

In 2001, the O-Train&#x27;s Trillium Line (then simply the &quot;O-Train&quot;) opened. Its northern terminus was at the new Bayview station on the central Transitway and its southern terminus at Greenboro on the southeast Transitway.

The southwest Transitway was gradually extended southward, first to Fallowfield in 2005 and then to Barrhaven Centre in 2011. A median busway section was added along Chapman Mills Drive to Nepean Woods in 2014. The first segment of the western Transitway opened in 2009 connecting Pinecrest and Bayshore. This was extended to Moodie in 2017.

Beginning in 2015, sections of the Transitway closed for conversion to light rail for the Confederation Line. Buses were rerouted to bus-only lanes along Highway 417, Regional Road 174, and city streets. The Confederation Line opened in 2019, along with a major re-organization of the Transitway network. Rapid routes no longer travelled through downtown Ottawa. Instead, all rapid routes use the Transitway to connect communities to the Confederation Line at one of three stations: Tunney&#x27;s Pasture, Hurdman, or Blair. Routes were also renumbered to correspond with their geographic service area, resulting in the retirement of route 95, the Transitway&#x27;s busiest and oldest route.

Multiple sections of the Transitway were permanently closed for O-Train Stage 2 construction in 2021 and 2022. In September of 2021, the Transitway was closed between Moodie and Bayshore, followed by the section between Bayshore and Pinecrest in April of 2022. Buses were detoured along Highway 417, with Moodie station being relocated to temporary bus stops at the interchange ramps, and some bus routes bypassing Pinecrest and Bayshore stations eastbound as a result. In June, the entirety of the central Transitway between Tunney&#x27;s Pasture and Dominion stations was closed, as well as the southwest Transitway between Iris and Baseline. Buses were detoured along Scott Street parallel to the former central Transitway, with a temporary extension and bridge connecting to Dominion Station. Buses were routed along Iris Street and Woodroffe Avenue between Iris and Baseline stations.

==Routes==
The following are OC Transpo&#x27;s rapid routes, which travel along the Transitway with frequent service connecting communities to the O-Train. Additional OC Transpo routes also use segments of the Transitway.

==Stations and segments==

===East===

The east Transitway currently consists of a series of intermittent bus-only lanes along Regional Road 174 between Blair and Place d&#x27;Orléans. It will be replaced by an east extension of the Confederation Line when it opens in 2025.
===Southeast===
The southeast Transitway is a dedicated busway adjacent to some rail corridors between Hurdman and South Keys.

===Central===
The central Transitway was a dedicated busway between Pimisi (formerly LeBreton) and Dominion stations. The Pimisi to Bayview segment was closed in January 2016 for O-Train Stage 1 construction and the Bayview to Tunney&#x27;s Pasture segment was closed in June 2016. In June 2022, the remaining segment of the central transitway west of Tunney&#x27;s Pasture was closed for O-Train Stage 2 construction, with buses now running along dedicated bus lanes on Scott Street. A temporary Transitway was built from Dominion station to the intersection of Churchill Road and Scott Street. The new Transitway travels over the old one via the bailey bridge and then alongside until the intersection of Scott / Churchill. Once New Ways to Bus is implemented, route 12 will service central transitway stations between Rideau and Tunney&#x27;s Pasture including Parliament and Lyon stations.

=== Downtown ===
The former downtown section of the Transitway consisted of two single bus-only lanes on Albert and Slater Streets (one-way public streets in opposite westbound and eastbound directions, respectively), with stops in each direction at Bay, Kent, Bank and Metcalfe Streets as well as on the Mackenzie King Bridge. Traffic congestion here, where the buses mingle with private vehicles, often caused service delays and was seen by some as the main weakness in the Transitway system.

Initial plans for the Transitway included a bus-only tunnel in this section but the cost of a ventilated tunnel for conventional buses was deemed too expensive and was not warranted at the time. In 2006, it was proposed to extend the O-Train downtown as a tramway over the same streets while keeping existing bus and car traffic. The idea was met with objections from businesses along those streets, as normal access to the businesses would be impeded.

In 2019, the Confederation Line opened, replacing the downtown portion of the Transitway with an underground, high-capacity rapid transit rail line. This service change greatly reduced the number of buses travelling on Albert and Slater streets.

=== Greenboro Busway===
 This former section of Transitway was a two lane bus-only corridor between Cahill and Lorry Greenburg Drives in the Greenboro neighbourhood in south Ottawa. Part of a planned neighbourhood in 1984, it opened in 1987 while the neighbourhood was still being developed. It was opened as a corridor with no stations, as it was planned to extend to Conroy Road once the neighbourhood was completed. It ran mostly without issue, servicing two routes and providing service during regular and peak periods.

As time went on, the planned neighbourhood&#x27;s density was heavily reduced due to heavy backlash from the local community using the slogan “buses out of backyards”. By 1989, OC Transpo began phasing out the corridor, and by 1990 it was declared surplus lands. On September 2, 1995, OC Transpo ran its final bus on the corridor, and it was then gated up and left abandoned for the next 7 years. After being sold to the city, it was officially fully removed by 2002.

===Southwest===
The southwest Transitway includes a dedicated busway from Lincoln Fields to Baseline. Buses then travel on reserved lanes before joining a busway before Fallowfield. This busway extends from Fallowfield to Barrhaven Centre. A separate median busway east of Marketplace connects Beatrice and Nepean Woods before traveling along reserved lanes to Riverview. There are plans to extend the transitway to Limebank. After New Ways to Bus in 2025, route 110 will offer station to station service between Limebank and Barrhaven Centre.

===West===

The west Transitway consisted of a dedicated busway between Pinecrest and Moodie, however the section between Moodie and Bayshore closed permanently in September 2021, followed by the section between Bayshore and Pinecrest in April 2022. Buses also use reserved lanes on Highway 417 between Moodie and Eagleson.

<doc id="1012064" wikidata="Q907289" url="?curid=1012064" title="Tereré">
<text> (of Guaraní origin) is an infusion of (botanical name &quot;Ilex paraguariensis&quot;) prepared with cold water, a lot of ice and &quot;pohã ñana&quot; (medicinal herbs), and in a slightly larger vessel. This infusion has its roots in Pre-Columbian America, which established itself as traditional during the time of Governorate of Paraguay. There&#x27;s also a variant made with juice, called &quot;Juice tereré&quot; or &quot;Russian tereré&quot;, depending on the region. On December 17, 2020, UNESCO declared the tereré of Paraguay as an intangible cultural heritage, which includes the drink (tereré) and its preparation methods with medicinal herbs (pohá ñaná).

It is similar to —a drink also based on yerba mate—but with the difference that tereré is consumed cold, preferably in the warmer areas of the Southern Cone. It is traditional from Paraguay, where it&#x27;s considered a cultural icon. In recent decades it has become popular in some areas of Southern Brazil, in Eastern Bolivia and in Argentina (countries where the tereré of juice is more popular than the tereré of water).

Both refreshing or medicinal herbs are often added, such as pererina, cocú, mint, sarsaparille, horsetail family, burrito, agrial or wax begonia, batatilla, verbena, spikesedges, ajenjo, slender dayflower, escobilla, lemon balm, saffron crocus, ginger, taropé, perdudilla blanca and others. Currently, in Paraguay exist various franchises that sell flavored ice based on medicinal-refreshing weeds/fruits for consumption in the tereré.

The tereré was declared the official drink of Paraguay and also the Cultural Heritage of the Nation. Every last Saturday of February the &quot;National Tereré Day&quot; is celebrated. By Resolution 219/2019, the National Secretariat of Culture declared the Traditional Practices and Knowledge of the Tereré in the culture of the Pohã Ñana as the National Intangible Cultural Heritage. On the other hand, the city of Itakyry is the permanent headquarters of the &quot;Festival of Tereré&quot; since 1998.

== History ==

Originally consumed by the Guaraní, its use was adopted during the Guaraní-Jesuit Missions time in the area of their missions. Tereré was spread by the emigrants, and has been a social beverage for centuries. People usually prepare one jar of water and a (or , or ) (Spanish) or (Portuguese) with a (Spanish) or (Portuguese) which is shared among the group of people. The area of the Guaraní-Jesuit Missions has a fairly hot climate and this drink is believed to refresh the body and can be a very low-calorie, non-alcoholic beverage. Additionally, it is an important ritual signifying trust and communion.

Many people drink with added herbs, both medicinal and refreshing. In northeastern Argentina it is commonly prepared either with water, medicinal herbs and ice cubes (called (tereré prepared with water)) or citrus, as in south-western Brazil, with fruit juices like lemon, lime, orange, or pineapple. This practice varies depending on the region, for example, in the Formosa Province (Argentina), as well in the majority of Paraguay, it is normally prepared with medicinal herbs. In Southern Paraguay it is often prepared with citrus juice. Mixing fruit juices with is commonly called (tereré with juice)—in northeastern Argentina—or (Russian tereré)—more common in Paraguay—because this practice is more common with Slavic immigrants in the northeast of Argentina and southern Paraguay.

If herbs or juice are part of the preparation, they are added to the water at this point. When consuming, the water is poured over the held in the and extracted from the with a metallic straw (with a filter included on it) called &quot;&quot;. The liquid is refilled as desired.

<doc id="1012065" wikidata="Q6519250" url="?curid=1012065" title="Leicester and Swannington Railway">
<text>The Leicester and Swannington Railway (L&amp;SR) was one of England&#x27;s first railways, built to bring coal from West Leicestershire collieries to Leicester, where there was great industrial demand for coal. The line opened in 1832, and included a tunnel over a mile in length, and two rope-worked inclined planes; elsewhere it was locomotive-operated, and it carried passengers.

When it was built, the was the only railway in the area, but the Midland Railway (MR) was formed and had a main line through Leicester, opened in 1840 and its directors decided to acquire the . They made a generous offer and they took possession in 1847. At first the Midland Railway line and the were not connected, but the Midland Railway constructed a route from its main line to Burton, using part of the . The by-passed the inclines for its new route, but most of the other parts of the continued in use until 1966. The Burton line continues in use at the present day.

==Prior history==
The industry of Leicester was dominant in the county and the region generally, but it was limited by poor transport links. The developing industry brought about a huge demand for coal. During the closing years of the eighteenth century, the opening of turnpikes, and improvements to the River Soar – the Loughborough Navigation in 1778; the Leicester Navigation in 1791) and then in 1814 the completion of the Grand Union Canal towards Rugby – were all supportive of Leicester&#x27;s development.

As early as 1790 a railway connection from Swannington was proposed:

In the 1820s the Leicester Navigation was carrying 56,000 tons of coal annually for Leicester and 59,000 tons for other markets. There was good quality coal nearby around Swannington but no usable transport link, so it was cheaper to bring coal thirty miles by canal from South Derbyshire. William Stenson was part-owner of Long Lane Pit near Whitwick (close to present-day Coalville). Frustrated by the situation, he visited the industrial north-east of England in 1827 and observed the success of the Stockton and Darlington Railway. Seeing a railway as a solution to his local difficulty, he enlisted the support of the wealthy weaver John Ellis, and together they travelled to see George Stephenson, who was engaged on the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Stephenson and his son Robert Stephenson, then 25, visited Leicester by invitation in the Autumn of 1828.

==Conception of the Leicester and Swannington Railway==

George Stephenson agreed to become involved in making a railway line from Swannington to Leicester; the first formal meeting to project the line was held at the Bell Inn in Leicester on 12 February 1829. At a further meeting on 24 June 1829, Robert Stephenson stated that a sixteen-mile line could be built for £75,540. Subscriptions amounting to £58,250 were raised at this meeting. The remainder of the £90,000 necessary for the construction of was raised through Stephenson&#x27;s financial contacts in Liverpool. The act of incorporation for the line, the (11 Geo. 4 &amp; 1 Will. 4. c. lviii), obtained royal assent on 29 May 1830. Authorised share capital was £90,000. The act prescribed that the company might carry goods, that is, operate as a carrier and not merely as a provider of the route for independent carriers.

George Stephenson was consulted about the track gauge to be selected for the line, as compared to that of the Canterbury and Whitstable line, and is quoted as saying:

Williams stresses the magnitude of the undertaking:

When completed it was the first locomotive railway in the Midland counties, and only the second south of Manchester, after the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway.

A second act for the company, the &#x27; (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. lxix), was obtained on 10 June 1833 giving authority to increase the share capital by £10,000. There was a third act of 30 June 1837, the &#x27; (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. lxvi), which authorised £40,000 increase in share capital, making a total of £140,000.

==Construction==
The engineer for the railway was Robert Stephenson, with the assistance of Thomas Miles, while George Stephenson raised part of the capital for the line from businesspeople in Liverpool. The line was to run from West Bridge, in Leicester, at a location alongside the navigable River Soar; the intention was to be able to continue the transit of coal by water. The line was to run to the north end of Swannington village, together with three colliery branches, to Whitwick, Ibstock and Bagworth. In addition there was to be a branch in Leicester to the North Bridge, although that was never made. The colliery branches, and the land acquisition for them, were authorised by the Leicester and Swannington Railway Act 1830, but the actual construction of them would be the financial responsibility of the colliery owners.

There was to be one tunnel, at Glenfield, just over a mile in length. Nine underbridges and one overbridge would be needed, and sixteen level crossings over public roads. The line was to be single throughout, except at stations.

The terrain was difficult, and due to the limited power of locomotives at the time, the line was built with two rope-worked inclined planes. One was at Bagworth; on a gradient of 1 in 29 it was self-acting, loaded wagons descending pulling up empty wagons. Originally it was to have been powered by a stationary steam engine. The top level was the summit of the line at an altitude of 565 feet (172m). The engine was built by the Horseley Coal and Iron Company., and was equipped with a very early example of a piston valve.

The other was near Swannington, on a gradient of 1 in 17 against the load

The line was standard gauge, with fish-bellied rails on half-round oak cross-sleepers, but longitudinal timbers were used in Glenfield Tunnel.

Construction began almost immediately but soon ran into trouble, particularly with the tunnel. Initial boring had suggested that it would not need a lining. However, it turned out that about would be through sand, requiring much more expensive construction, and in fact doubling the estimated cost of the tunnel. During its construction, on 5 April 1831, one of the contractors, Daniel Jowett, fell down a working shaft and was killed. Three separate contractors gave up their contracts and had to be replaced.

The novelty of a tunnel attracted the interest of local people and in March 1832 temporary gates were placed at the entrances &quot;so as to keep out intruders on Sundays until the permanent gates can be put up&quot;.

==Opening and early operation==
===First formal journey===
A formal opening of the first part of the line took place on 17 July 1832; a passenger journey for proprietors and directors and their friends only, ran from the West Bridge terminus in Leicester to the summit level at Staunton Road crossing, a distance of 11 miles 55 chains (19 km). The inaugural train was drawn by the locomotive &quot;Comet&quot; and consisted of an open wagon specially covered in for use of the directors, the company&#x27;s only open second-class carriage and ten new coal wagons with improvised seats, conveying in all about 400 passengers. It left West Bridge at 10:00 and reached Bagworth at 11:00 &quot;A slight delay was caused by the engine chimney striking the roof of the tunnel at a point where the platelayers had temporarily raised the track to pack a &#x27;low&#x27; place. The train was halted specially at Glenfield Brook to enable the passengers, especially the ladies, to remove the effects of the enforced sojourn in the tunnel.&quot; The return journey conveyed two wagons of coal in addition.

===Public opening===
The general public were able to travel to Bagworth and back by a second special train at 16:30. On the next day, the ordinary train service started; this usually consisted of three empty wagon trains each weekday, leaving West Bridge at 08:00, 13:00 and 16:30; the passenger carriage was attached to these and the corresponding return loaded trips. Apparently, special passenger trips were run for a few weeks after opening, until the novelty of a train journey had worn off.

===Coal rates===
At first only Bagworth colliery was connected to the line, and accordingly income from mineral traffic was far below what was planned. Pressing ahead with the construction of the northern section of the authorised line was called for. In addition, a rebate was offered to other coal owners whose workings were near to the open section but not connected by rail; the rebate was in recognition of the cost of road transport from those pits to the railway, and of the breakage of coal due to the additional transhipment. The rebate proved very effective and those pits forwarded considerably increased quantities.

===Train operation===
The usual train consisted of twenty-four wagons of each. The idea that there would be a demand from passengers came as something of a surprise to the directors, but a carriage was hastily built, and very soon the line was carrying about 60 passengers a day and their fares were repaying one per cent of the capital. In time, both first and second class was provided. On payment of the fare at the departure station, each passenger would receive a metal token marked with the destination. This would be given up on arrival and reused. Small four-wheeled wagons and coaches, painted plain blue, comprised the rolling stock.

For many years facilities for passengers remained primitive; tickets were procured at local inns; passenger carriages were attached to goods trains. At West Bridge carriages were drawn into a siding by horses once they had been detached from the goods wagons. It was well into the 1870s before a platform was provided, and the conveyance of passengers at the rear of coal trains continued until 1887. From that time the Midland Railway supplied a proper branch train of six-wheel carriages hauled by a Midland 0-6-0 tender locomotive.

===Permanent way problems===
The cross-sleepers were found to cause difficulties, especially in cuttings, and some sections were replaced with stone blocks. However the stone blocks required constant packing to maintain line, level and gauge, and were considered to be harder riding than timber sleepers. Nevertheless, some of the stone blocks continued in use until at least 1885.

===Further opening===
The remainder of the line from Staunton Road to Ashby Road opened on 1 February 1833 or a few days before that. From Ashby Road to Long Lane, Coalville, was opened on 22 April 1833 for coal traffic and on 27 April 1833 for passengers, completing the intended extent of passenger operation, as from that point to Swannington would be used for mineral traffic only. The continuation to Swannington probably opened at the end of November 1833.

===Soar Lane, Leicester===
There had previously been plans to extend at Leicester across the Leicester Canal to Soar Lane. The decision was taken to revive the Soar Lane branch on 22 October 1832. On 10 June 1833 the necessary act of Parliament was secured; an opening bridge was required over the Leicester Canal. The branch was brought into use on 4 October 1834.

==Inclines==
===Bagworth incline operation===
The Bagworth incline was 43 chains in length and the gradient 1 in 29. It was self-acting: the loaded wagons descended by gravity, pulling up the lighter, empty ones by means of a hemp rope. The rope passed around a large horizontal pulley at the top. When a train from Leicester arrived at the Bagworth station at the foot of the incline, the locomotive was detached and the empty wagons connected to the rope. The loaded waggons had been brought by another locomotive to the top, and they were attached to the other end of this rope. Their greater weight pulled the empty ones to the top. In the middle of the incline there was a passing place and from this loop to the top there were three rails, the centre rail being common to both up and down movements; the object of this was to account for the width of the wheel and the position of the rope. 10 or 12 loaded waggons of about 6 tonnes each were run down at one time the descent occupying eight or nine minutes.

===Swannington Incline problems and later closure===
The Swannington incline was 48 chains in length on a gradient of 1 in 17. It was operated by a stationary steam engine. The engine developed problems at the end of November 1833, and arrangements were had to be made to get horses to haul wagons up the incline. The working of the incline was entirely suspended on 7 March 1834, when the Breedon Hill lime and Peggs Green coal traffics stopped using the railways in protest against a rate increase. However the traffic resumed on 11 May.

Traffic at Swannington was never heavy, and the collieries there were soon worked out. The Coleorton Railway had been made to bring coal and other minerals from Worthington to Swannington, being transshipped to the L&amp;SR, but this traffic ceased in 1860. Calcutta Colliery was the last to be closed, in 1892, but it had to continue being pumped out to prevent inundation of other pits in the vicinity. Coal was brought down the incline for the pumping engine, until electric pumps were installed in 1947, and the incline was closed on 14 November 1947.

===Bagworth incline accident===
In 1843 a serious accident took place on the Bagworth incline. A train of goods wagons and an empty passenger carriage was being lowered down the incline when it slipped from the incline rope, and ran at high speed down the incline and was wrecked. The company decided to discontinue the use of the incline for passenger traffic. Passengers had to disembark from their trains and walk up or down the incline to rejoin the train.

==Connecting lines==
The did not make any branch lines itself, although from the beginning, mine and quarry owners were encouraged to make their own connecting mineral lines from their workings.

===Groby Granite Railway===
This branch opened on the same day as the Leicester and Swannington Railway, joining the line about halfway between Glenfield and Ratby. The junction was made by a turntable into a loop siding off the main line. The branch closed around 1843. After the had been upgraded by the Midland Railway, the Groby branch was re-opened around 1866–1870. A proper running junction with sidings was put in place. The branch ran northward for over three miles, to the Old Groby Quarry, close to the centre of Groby village. Later extensions linked to other quarries in and near Groby: the Castle Hill Quarry (after 1870), the Bunney Hill Quarry, the Sheet Hedges Wood Quarry (1890s), and the Dowry Quarry (1907 to 1916).

The wagons were hauled by a stationary engine at the summit of the hill beside the Ratby Road. The loaded wagons were pulled there from the quarries and then they ran downhill to the junction with , speed being controlled by a brakesman. Two horses were aboard for the downhill journey; they drew empty wagons back up the incline.

===Coleorton Railway===

Sir George Beaumont owned lands and colliery workings at Coleorton, to the northwest of Swannington. He had anticipated that the Leicester and Swannington Railway would be extended to Coleorton, but the directors decided not to do so. On 28 September 1832 Beaumont wrote to the company saying that he would be willing to make a line from the Coleorton colliery area to the at Peggs Green if the would meet the parliamentary costs of obtaining an authorising act of Parliament. The agreed to this arrangement and the Coleorton Railway received its authorising act of Parliament, the (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. lxxi), on 10 June 1833.

It opened in 1834, using horse traction. It ran from a junction with the 4 ft 2in gauge Ticknall Tramway at Worthington to the foot of the Swannington incline. Leleux states that it never made a physical connection with the . However Hartley states that by November 1833 the first loads of coal from the Coleorton Railway were being worked up the Swannington incline, though by teams of horses due to problems with the winding engine., and Clinker states that traffic returns show 138 tons of coal from the Coleorton Railway were conveyed on the in November 1833 and assumes that this used the incline. The Coleorton Railway ceased working during 1860, and part of its course was operated as a siding from the Ashby to Derby line, which opened in 1874, following a similar alignment to the Ticknall Tramway.

===Other branches===
Other branches were made: they were the Bagworth Colliery branch, opened in July 1832; the Ibstock Colliery branch, opened in 1832; the Long Lane (Whitwick) Colliery branch, opened in 1833; and a branch to Snibston Colliery, opened in 1833. Two further branches to Snibston were built up to 1850; they were followed later by the Nailstone Colliery branch, opened in 1866, and Ellistown Colliery Branch, opened about 1875–1876.

==Locomotives==
===Initial designs===
Five locomotives were built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the line. The first was &quot;Comet&quot;, shipped from the works by sea and canal. The second engine, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, was delivered in 1832; both had four-coupled wheels. &quot;Phoenix&quot; was sold in 1835 to work in the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway. The next were &quot;Samson&quot; and &quot;Goliath&quot;, delivered in 1833. They were initially four-coupled, but were extremely unstable and a pair of trailing wheels were added. This 0-4-2 formation was also used for &quot;Hercules,&quot; the next engine to enter service. These were the first six-wheeled goods engines with inside cylinders and, after the flanges were taken off the centre pairs of wheels, were so satisfactory, that Stephenson decided never to build another four-wheeled engine.

===0-6-0 design===
By 1834, traffic had increased to such an extent that more powerful engines were needed and the next to be delivered was &quot;Atlas,&quot; the first ever six-coupled inside cylinder design. These engines were more stable than their outside cylindered counterparts.

So far all the engines had been provided by Stephenson, but the directors decided to try one of Edward Bury&#x27;s locomotives. An 0-4-0, Liverpool, was delivered in 1834 but it proved unequal to the loads hauled by &quot;Atlas.&quot; The next engine bought for the line was &quot;Vulcan,&quot; an 0-6-0 by Tayleur and Company. The last two were constructed by the Haigh Foundry, &quot;Ajax&quot;, 0-4-2 and &quot;Hector&quot;, 0-6-0.

===Whistle===
The historian Clement Stretton relates that towards the close of the year 1833 a collision took place between a train at a cart crossing the line near Thornton. The engine was “Samson”. The engine driver had a horn but could not attract the attention of the cart driver, and the engine struck it. Mr Baxter the line manager suggested the use of a steam trumpet or whistle and by Mr George Stephenson&#x27;s instructions such an appliance was at once constructed by a local musical instrument maker and it worked satisfactorily.

If this is factual, it would appear to be the creation of the first steam whistle. However many factories used steam power supplied by stationary steam engines to drive mill machinery, and it seems remarkable that steam whistles had not been in use to indicate for example the start and end of the working day. Clinker is dismissive of this story for several reasons; in particular the board minutes recorded considerable detail of trivial events, yet this is not reported.

==The Midland Railway==
===Competition===
The had not faced competition for some time, but in 1835 the Midland Counties Railway was proposed, for a line from collieries in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to Leicester and Rugby. The Midland Counties Railway was authorised on 21 June 1836. The line opened on 4 May 1840.

The Leicester Navigation immediately suffered from the competition and lowered its rates considerably. This put the cost of coal from those regions below that for which West Leicestershire products could be sold, forcing their owners to reduce their own prices.
The was in turmoil, looking for an alternative business, and in 1845 the Midland Railway, successor to the Midland Counties Railway, made an offer to purchase the . The motivation of the Midland Railway was partly to exclude competing railways that might take on the . The offer was excellent, and the shareholders agreed on 20 August 1845. The (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ccxliii) ratified it as from 27 July 1846. The Midland began working the on 1 January 1847.

===Midland Railway improvements===
The Midland Railway had acquired miles of railway, eight locomotives, six carriages, and twelve goods vehicles. The line was not physically connected to any other railway.
In July 1847 the Midland got authorisation in the (10 &amp; 11 Vict. c. cxxii) to make a new railway from Leicester to Burton, incorporating part of the into the route. The was doubled between Desford Junction and Thornton, also between Bagworth and Mantle Lane, Coalville, and a new deviation line, two miles in length, was constructed, by-passing the Bagworth self-acting incline.

The old Bagworth incline was closed after cessation of traffic on 25 March and replaced on 27 March 1848 by the new double line, with a ruling gradient of 1 in 66.

It was soon discovered that the engines were inadequate to cope with the gradient, so that banking engines had to be used. Later the Midland used a more powerful &quot;Buffalo&quot; design, but as the system was still disconnected from the general railway network, the locomotive had to be moved through the streets of Leicester by road.

===Leicester to Burton line===
The Midland Railway opened its Leicester to Burton line, incorporating part of the , on 1 August 1849. It ran from a connection at Knighton Junction, a short distance south of Leicester station; in 1850 a south curve was constructed there, making it a triangular junction. The Leicester passenger terminal had always been of the most basic description, but it was not until 13 March 1893 that the Midland Railway opened a new station there, at West Bridge.

The original Leicester termination of the continued in use as the West Bridge branch until passenger services were withdrawn on 24 September 1928 and freight on 2 May 1966.

In 1969 Glenfield Tunnel, on the original, and now by-passed, route was purchased by Leicester Corporation for £5, and sealed.
The present Leicester to Burton line closed to passengers on 7 September 1964.

==Remains==
Some remains of the Leicester and Swannington Railway are visible and can be visited.
* Much of the land at the Leicester terminus of the railway at West Bridge has been converted into a park called The Rally.
* A distance along the track bed north-west from West Bridge has been paved to provide a footpath and is also part of National Cycle Network route 63.
* Though some ventilation shafts of Glenfield tunnel are situated in private gardens some are visible by the side of public roads. Most are grade II listed buildings.
* After the closure of the West Bridge branch, Leicester City Council acquired Glenfield tunnel which required strengthening in places. The tunnel itself underwent a retrofit in 2008 to install strengthening rings that are hoped to prevent a collapse of the extant tunnel shaft. The £500,000 reinforcement project was commissioned by the Leicester city council and was recorded by the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust and photographed by the Leicestershire Industrial History Society. Occasional &quot;open days&quot; are held for organised groups. The western portal of Glenfield tunnel can be viewed from a public footpath in Glenfield, . The portal, which is a grade II listed building, has been secured.
* Most of the track bed from Station Road, Glenfield , to Station Road, Ratby , has been paved to provide a public footpath and is also part of National Cycle Network route.
* The incline at Bagworth, now bypassed by a deviation line, is a public footpath, at top to near bottom, though its profile has been affected by mining subsidence. Near the top was the bow-fronted incline-keeper&#x27;s house, , see photograph near the top of this page, and the demolition remains of the building were visible in 2023.
* At Coalville the original building for passengers to buy tickets is now a children&#x27;s nursery beside the level crossing, , and is a Grade II Listed Building.
* The incline at Swannington is under the supervision of the Swannington Heritage Trust and the track bed down the incline has been opened as a permissive path with information boards. The foundations of the engine house at the top of the incline, , have been uncovered and about of track have been re-laid. The historic winding engine, see photograph above, was removed from here after the incline closed to the National Railway Museum at York.

<doc id="1012066" wikidata="Q695101" url="?curid=1012066" title="Pickled herring">
<text>Pickled herring is a traditional way of preserving herring as food by pickling or curing.

Most cured herring uses a two-step curing process: it is first cured with salt to extract water; then the salt is removed and the herring is brined in a vinegar, salt, and sugar solution, often with peppercorn, bay leaves, raw onions, and so on. Additional flavourings include sherry, mustard and dill, while other non-traditional ingredients have also begun being included in recent years.

Pickled herring remains a popular food or ingredient to dishes in many parts of Europe including Scandinavia, Great Britain, the Baltic, Eastern and Central Europe, as well as the Netherlands. It is also popular in parts of Canada such as British Columbia and Newfoundland. It is also associated with Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, becoming a staple at kiddushes and social gatherings. Pickled herring is one of the twelve dishes traditionally served at Christmas Eve in Russia, Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine. Pickled herring is also eaten at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve to symbolize a prosperous New Year in Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, and parts of Scandinavia.

==History==
Pickled herrings have been a staple in Northern Europe since medieval times, being a way to store and transport fish, especially necessary in meatless periods like Lent. The herrings would be prepared, then packed in barrels for storage or transportation. In 1801 Dutch fishermen amongst the prisoners of war in the Norman Cross Prison were sent to Scotland to teach the Scottish herring fishermen how to cure fish using the Dutch method.

===Geographic distribution===

In the Nordic countries, once the pickling process is finished and depending on which of the dozens of herring flavourings (mustard, onion, garlic, lingonberries etc.) are selected, it is eaten with dark rye bread, crisp bread, sour cream, or potatoes. This dish is common at Christmas, Easter, and Midsummer, where it is frequently accompanied by spirits like akvavit. 

Soused herring (&quot;maatjesharing&quot; or just &quot;maatjes&quot; in Dutch) is an especially mild salt herring, which is made from young, immature herrings. The herrings are ripened for a couple of days in oak barrels in a salty solution, or brine. In English, a &quot;soused herring&quot; can also be a cooked marinated herring.

Rollmops are pickled herring fillets rolled (hence the name) into a cylindrical shape around a piece of pickled gherkin or an onion. They are thought to have developed as a special treat in 19th century Berlin, and the word borrowed from the German.

Fish cured through pickling or salting have long been consumed in the British Isles. Like jellied eel, it was primarily eaten by, and is sometimes associated with, the working class. Kipper is a dish eaten in Great Britain, Ireland, and parts of Canada. It consists of a split open herring, pickled or salted, and cold-smoked.

Red herring is similar to kippers but is whole and ungutted; it is more heavily salted and is smoked for 2-3 weeks. The main UK export markets are Europe and West Africa. 

Pickled herring, especially brined herring, is common in Russia and Ukraine, where it is served cut into pieces and seasoned with sunflower oil and onions, or can be part of herring salads, such as dressed herring (, , lit. &#x27;herring under a fur coat&#x27;), which are usually prepared with vegetables and seasoned with mayonnaise dressing.

Brined herring is common in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, perhaps best known for vorschmack salad known in English simply as &quot;chopped herring&quot; and as schmaltz herring in Yiddish. In Israel it is commonly known as &quot;dag maluach&quot; which means &quot;salted fish&quot;.

Pickled herring can also be found in the cuisine of Hokkaidō in Japan, where families traditionally preserved large quantities for winter.

In Nova Scotia, Canada, pickled herring with onions is called &quot;Solomon Gundy&quot; (not to be confused with the Jamaican pickled fish pâté of the same name).

&quot;Bismarck herring&quot; (German &quot;Bismarckhering&quot;) is the common name for pickled herring in Germany, and the product is sometimes sold elsewhere under that name. There are various theories as to why the product is associated with Bismarck.

== Nutritional content ==
Pickled herring is rich in tyramine and thus should be avoided in the diet of people being treated with an antidepressant monoamine oxidase inhibitor. 

As with fresh herring, pickled herring is an excellent natural source of both vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids. It is also a good source of selenium and vitamin B12. 100 grams may provide 680 IU of vitamin D, or 170% of the DV, as well as 84% of the DV for selenium, and 71% of the DV for vitamin B12.

<text>The G12 Vision is a Christian evangelism and discipleship strategy established by Pastor César Castellanos, the founder of International Charismatic Mission Church. G12 has been adopted worldwide by different churches.

==History==

The G12 Vision was formulated in 1991 by Pastor César Castellanos, after attending the Yoido Full Gospel Church in 1983. Seeing that their cell group model fosters church growth, he revamped David Yonggi Cho&#x27;s South Korean church growth strategy. It grew into another church growth enterprise that churches around the world came to study in their own attempts to foster growth, including mainline Pentecostal denominations like the Church of God (Cleveland).

The G12 model has been prominently adopted by churches in many countries including Canada, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.

==G12 International Conference==

An annual G12 International Conference is held in Bogotá, Colombia in January and is hosted by Misión Carismática Internacional church. The President of Colombia has frequently attended these events. Former President of Colombia (2002–2010) Álvaro Uribe attended in 2004, 2008, and 2009. In 2006, Senator Germán Vargas Lleras attended and in 2010, former Minister of Defence and future President Juan Manuel Santos spoke at the conference.

<doc id="1012083" wikidata="Q14864388" url="?curid=1012083" title="Synaptophysin">
<text>Synaptophysin, also known as the major synaptic vesicle protein p38, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;SYP&quot; gene.

== Genomics ==

The gene is located on the short arm of X chromosome (Xp11.23-p11.22). It is 12,406 bases in length and lies on the minus strand. The encoded protein has 313 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 33.845 kDa.

== Molecular biology ==

The protein is a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein with four transmembrane domains weighing 38 kDa. It is present in neuroendocrine cells and in virtually all neurons in the brain and spinal cord that participate in synaptic transmission. It acts as a marker for neuroendocrine tumors, and its ubiquity at the synapse has led to the use of synaptophysin immunostaining for quantification of synapses.

The exact function of the protein is unknown: it interacts with the essential synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin, but when the synaptophysin gene is experimentally inactivated in animals, they still develop and function normally. Recent research has shown, however, that elimination of synaptophysin in mice creates behavioral changes such as increased exploratory behavior, impaired object novelty recognition, and reduced spatial learning.

== Clinical importance ==

This gene has been implicated in X-linked intellectual disability.

Using immunohistochemistry, synaptophysin can be demonstrated in a range of neural and neuroendocrine tissues, including cells of the adrenal medulla and pancreatic islets. As a specific marker for these tissues, it can be used to identify tumours arising from them, such as neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, phaeochromocytoma, carcinoid, small-cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma, among others. Diagnostically, it is often used in combination with chromogranin A.

== Interactions ==

Synaptophysin has been shown to interact with AP1G1 and SIAH2.

* Merkel-cell carcinoma - although origin of this tumor is unclear, it does express synaptophysin

<text>Pagode () is a Brazilian style of music that originated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as a subgenre of Samba. Pagode originally meant a celebration with food, music, dance, and party. In 1978, singer Beth Carvalho was introduced to this music, liked it from the beginning, and recorded tracks by Zeca Pagodinho and others. Over time, pagode has been used by many commercial groups, which have included a version of the music filled with clichés, and there is now a sentiment that the term is a pejorative for &quot;very commercial pop music&quot; (see Pagode Romântico).

Original pagode developed at the beginning of the 1980s, with the advent of the band Fundo de Quintal and the introduction of new instruments in the classical samba formation. Pagode lyricism also represented a kind of evolution toward the tradition of malicious and ironic samba lyrics, with a much heavier use of slang and underground terms.

The 4-string banjo, whose introduction is mostly credited to Almir Guineto, has a different and louder sound than the cavaco; that loudness was an advantage in acoustic environments (samba circle), where there are many percussion instruments and people singing along. The 4-string banjo is one of the most characteristic instruments of the pagode sound.

The tan-tan, whose introduction is credited to sereno, is a more dynamic type of surdo, used to keep the main beat of the samba, the &quot;heart of the samba&quot;, and played with the hands.

The hand-repique, whose introduction is credited to Ubirany, is a percussive instrument used specially for rhythmic turnarounds.

<text>The U.S. state of New York contains 26 congressional districts. Each district elects one member of the United States House of Representatives to represent it. 

The state was redistricted in 2022, following the 2020 U.S. census. It lost one seat in Congress. According to CNN, unnamed census officials stated that if 89 more people had been counted in New York&#x27;s census results, and all other states&#x27; population figures had remained the same, New York would not have lost a congressional seat.

==Current districts and representatives==
The list below shows the members of the United States House delegation from New York, along with district boundaries and district CPVI ratings. As of February 2025, New York is represented by 26 members of Congress, including nineteen Democrats and seven Republicans.
