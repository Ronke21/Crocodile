<text>JJ72 were an alternative rock band from Dublin, Ireland. After forming in 1996, they signed to Lakota Records in 1999 and released two albums before splitting in 2006.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
The band was formed in 1996 by lead singer and songwriter Mark Greaney and drummer Fergal Matthews, while studying at Belvedere College. Greaney grew up in Dublin, where for a time he lived next door to Phil Lynott. Matthews originated from County Meath. The name &#x27;JJ72&#x27; derives from a window at Belvedere College made from 72 jam jars. They cited Nirvana, Mudhoney and Joy Division as influences. After auditioning several bassists they recruited their schoolmate Garvin Smith on bass in 1996. After a few early gigs, Smith left, and Greaney and Matthews once again set about auditions for a new bassist. Two bassists had short stints with the band, but in 1997 Greaney and Matthews entered the studio as a duo to record their first demo. They sent it to local record companies and media but with little response. In 1998 they started university courses, but shortly after starting they decided to concentrate on the band; They played a concert at Behan&#x27;s pub in Dublin, backed by a string quartet, and were asked to appear on local television. They then recruited Hilary Woods, who Greaney had known for several years. Despite having only picked up bass recently, Woods became a member in January 1999. They recorded a second demo and targeted the UK, playing several gigs there and getting a write-up in &quot;Select&quot;. This led to interest from the Dublin-based Sony sub-label Lakota Records, who signed the band in mid-1999.

===Commercial success===
Début single &quot;October Swimmer&quot; was released in November that year, and was named &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; by BBC Radio 1 DJ Mark Radcliffe. They were given support slots with The Dandy Warhols and My Vitriol. The band had their first hit with &quot;Long Way South&quot; in May 2000, which peaked at number 68 in the UK and they played at festivals including Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds later that year.

The band released their eponymously titled debut album in Summer 2000. Produced by Ian Caple, the album was a critical and commercial success and has sold in excess of 500,000 copies in the band&#x27;s native Ireland and in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. In Germany, a special &#x27;tour edition&#x27; was released, including a second CD-ROM disc. The album spawned the singles &quot;Snow&quot;, &quot;October Swimmer&quot;, &quot;Long Way South&quot;, and &quot;Oxygen&quot;, and saw the band perform promotional tours in Europe and the US. &quot;Oxygen&quot; gave the band their first top 30 single in the UK, leading the band to perform on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. After touring with Coldplay and Embrace, they set out on their own headline tour in 2001. They supported Muse on a tour of Europe, headlined the &quot;NME Brats&quot; tour and played in Japan. Several performances had been cancelled after Greaney lost his voice and there were further cancellations in 2001 after Matthews was knocked off his motorbike, with Kylie Minogue&#x27;s drummer Bob Knight standing in for a few gigs. Matthews recovered in time for the festival season and support slots with U2. The band received an Irish Music Award for &#x27;Best New Band&#x27; later that year. The band continued touring into February 2002.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;I To Sky&quot; followed in October 2002. It contained the singles &quot;Formulae&quot; and &quot;Always and Forever&quot; and reached the Top 5 of the Irish album charts and the Top 20 of the UK Albums Chart. The album was backed by a UK and Europe headlining tour, either side of eight shows supporting Suede in November 2002.

===Return and split===
In February 2003, bassist Hilary Woods left the band. Greaney and Matthews recruited Canadian-born bassist Sarah Fox as her replacement. The band played sporadic shows through 2003 and began recording new material with producer Ken Thomas in August that year, for a release expected in January 2004. In December 2004, it was reported that recording for the band&#x27;s third album had been completed at Parkgate Studios, Catsfield, with producer Ian Caple. A Spring 2005 release was tentatively announced. In May 2005, the band played its first shows since November 2003 and released the download and 7&quot;-only single &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, which reached 136 in the UK Singles Chart. A second single, &quot;Coming Home&quot; followed in August 2005 and peaked at number 52 in the UK Singles Chart. A tour followed in September 2005, with Greaney expressing from the stage his frustrations regarding the release of the third album, pending an ongoing dispute with their record labels Lakota Records/Sony. An October 2005 release date for the album failed to materialise. Songs rumoured to have been included on the new album: &quot;Take From Me&quot;, &quot;Radio&quot;, &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Rainfalls&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Nothing In This World&quot;, &quot;Some Day&quot; (this song, as Demo version, appear as B-side on the &quot;coming Home&quot; 7&quot; vinyl). A promotional CD containing &quot;Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Take From Me&quot;, &quot;Radio&quot; and &quot;Everything&quot; was circulated in 2005.

However, on 22 June 2006, JJ72 issued a press release announcing they were to split up after 10 years together. They cited a struggle with their record label as their main reason for the split. This press release began by borrowing John Donne&#x27;s epitaph and read:

===Post-JJ72 activities===
Mark Greaney embarked upon his first tour as a solo artist in May 2007. He subsequently formed a new band called Concerto For Constantine, featuring himself (guitar and vocals), Gavin Fox (ex-Idlewild/Turn/Vega4 on bass) and Binzer (ex-BellX1/Frames/Halite on drums). The band performed live throughout Ireland as part of the &quot;2fm 2moro 2our&quot; in November 2007 and supported Smashing Pumpkins in Belfast and Dublin in Spring 2008. Concerto for Constantine then went on to sell out headline shows in Dublin and London, and also played at the Oxegen Festival in Ireland and at T in the Park in Scotland in July 2008. Post activity with Concerto for Constantine, Greaney returned to academia and is now head of education at the British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM). New musical work includes the project, Vishion Factum, focusing on transhumanism and the aesthetics of succulent plants.

Sarah Fox played bass for a band called Lluther, but has since left the band and is now a London-based graphic designer. Fergal Matthews lives in Norway and plays drums for Blodhevn. Woods returned to visual arts and started a solo project called &quot;The River Cry&quot;, with a debut self-titled album released on 14 February 2013. She is now recording under her own name on the Sacred Bones label, and recorded two LPs in 2018 and 2020.

<doc id="1034065" wikidata="Q259170" url="?curid=1034065" title="7.62×25mm Tokarev">
<text>The 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge (designated as the 7.62 × 25 Tokarev by the C.I.P.) is a Soviet rimless bottleneck pistol cartridge widely used in former Soviet states and in China, among other countries. The cartridge was largely superceded in the Soviet Union by the 9×18mm Makarov cartridge.

==History==
Prior to the First World War, the 7.63×25mm Mauser C96 pistol gained in popularity worldwide. In 1908, the Tsarist army placed the C96 on a list of approved sidearms that officers could purchase at their own expense in lieu of carrying the Nagant M1895 revolver. Between 1914 and 1917, more Mauser pistols and ammunition were obtained as captured arms from German and Turkish forces.

The Mauser and its cartridge were used on all fronts of the Russian Civil War and in the 1920s, during a period of relatively close cooperation between Soviet Russia and the Weimar Republic, the Red Army purchased batches of the smaller Bolo version as well as ammunition for use by its officers. Although a copy of the cartridge was being produced at the Podolsky Ammunition Factory, the Soviets eventually purchased a license and manufacturing equipment from DWM in Germany to produce the cartridge.

In 1929, the Soviet Artillery Committee made a proposal to develop a domestic pistol chambered for the Mauser cartridge. After considerable research and development, it was decided that the &quot;Model 1930 7.62 mm pistol cartridge,&quot; essentially the Mauser round with minor modifications, was to become the standard caliber for Soviet pistols and submachine guns. Early versions of the Vasily Degtyaryov–designed PPD-40 submachine gun were marked &quot;for Mauser cartridge caliber 7.62 mm&quot;.

Although dimensionally similar to the Mauser cartridge (so much so that both cartridges will chamber, load, and fire in any of these firearms), the Soviets increased the power of the Tokarev cartridge powder charge significantly. As such, while the lower-power Mauser rounds can be safely used in any of these firearms, the Tokarev cartridge is not safe for use in firearms which were not designed for the added pressure.

==Cartridge dimensions==
The 7.62×25mm Tokarev has 1.09 ml (16.8 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity.
7.62×25mm Tokarev maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions All sizes in millimeters (mm).

Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 = 19 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in), four grooves, diameter of lands = , diameter of grooves = , land width = and the primer type is Berdan or boxer small pistol.

According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) rulings the 7.62×25mm Tokarev case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every handgun cartridge combo has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.
This means that 7.62×25mm Tokarev chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are currently (2017) proof tested at PE piezo pressure.

==Design==

The cartridge is in principle an enhanced Russian version of the 7.63×25mm Mauser. The Russians produced a wide array of loadings for this cartridge for use in submachine guns. These include armor-piercing, tracer, and incendiary rounds. This cartridge has excellent penetration and can easily defeat lighter ballistic vests (NIJ level I and IIA) as well as some kevlar helmets, such as the American PASGT helmet.

When fired from a carbine-length barrel, the cartridge may penetrate NIJ level II, but is sometimes stopped by the current standard armor NIJ level IIIA. (Level IIIA is an advanced version of the Level II that can stop faster bullets than Level II, but does not meet the Level III standard. NIJ standards factor in up to 1,400 fps of bullet velocity; higher-velocity rounds can eventually penetrate them, but by definition, level III must be able to stop any 7.65 mm bullet ). Although most firearms chambered in this caliber were declared obsolete and removed from military inventories, some police and special forces units in Russia, Pakistan, and China may still use it because of the large quantity of stored ammunition available.

There is a common misconception that military surplus 7.62 Tokarev ammunition uses copper-coated mild steel bullets, and that this increases the chance of dangerous ricochets when fired at hard targets and can damage bullet traps often used on shooting ranges. While steel-core ammunition in 7.62×25 is available internationally, in the United States the importation of 7.62×25 cartridges loaded with copper-coated steel bullets is illegal; federal law defines these as armor-piercing pistol ammunition. So-called steel bullets sold are generally lead-core bullets with copper-washed steel jackets, and these do not present a significantly greater risk of ricochet than a standard copper-jacketed projectile.

In 2018, 7.62×25 ammunition was available for export from Romania, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Russia.

==Reloading==
If reloadable cartridge cases are not available they can be produced by resizing and trimming 9mm Winchester Magnum brass, or alternately by reforming 5.56×45mm NATO or 223 Remington cases. The cartridge case is inserted into a forming die, which produces a shoulder in the correct position, and the portion of the case projecting through the top is sawn off. Afterward, a reamer is used to ream out the new case neck to an acceptable thickness. This can also be accomplished by turning the neck to the correct thickness. This is necessary because a powerful rifle cartridge has been cut back to where the brass is relatively thick. If the brass is left too thick it may prevent chambering of the cartridge. Using this thicker brass may reduce the internal capacity of the cartridge and may cause excessive chamber pressures. Use appropriate caution when reloading converted rifle brass. Alternately, reloaders can purchase proper, new cases from Starline Mfg. Use .308&quot; or .309&quot; bullets for reloading for the Tokarev TT-33 and Czech CZ-52. Mauser C96 and C30 &quot;Broomhandle&quot; pistols typically have oversized bores, and .311&quot; bullets may be needed to produce acceptable accuracy.

However, firing the 7.62×25 out of a Mauser C96 is not recommended, as it is too powerful and it may damage the pistol. Firearms that use the 7.62×25 cartridge can reliably fire 7.63×25mm rounds. Hornady makes an 85-grain .309&quot; &quot;XTP&quot; bullet that functions well in all these pistols. On the Starline website, information is given about using the slightly less powerful, but otherwise nearly identical ammunition designed for the Mauser C96 pistol (7.63×25mm Mauser) from which the Tokarev cartridge was derived, in pistols chambered for the Tokarev round. This was common practice by Finnish and German forces in WWII.

==Performance==
Various Tokarev cartridges achieve muzzle velocities around the range of 1,300 to 1,800 fps. A common velocity is around with about of energy. Given the wide disparity in ammunition manufactured in many different nations, ammunition is encountered that yields higher and lower velocities. Some newly manufactured ammunition intended for commercial use has a velocity of approximately .

Wolf Gold FMJ tops out at with of energy, as does PPU ammunition. Some of this ammunition, such as the Wolf Gold and Sellier &amp; Bellot, use boxer primed brass cases that are reloadable.

==Notable variants==
The Soviet P-41 was a 74 grain, steel-cored, incendiary variant produced for use in the PPSh-41 and PPS-43 during World War II. This ammunition would achieve a velocity of 1,600 feet per second when fired from these firearms.

The Chinese 7.62mm Type P is a special subsonic, heavy, pointed (spitzer) loading of the cartridge, designed specifically for use in suppressed firearms. The Chinese-produced standard loading of the cartridge is designated as the &quot;Type 64&quot;.

==Firearms and Service Use==

The most notable use of this cartridge was in the Tokarev TT-33 pistol, which was the Soviet Union&#x27;s standard service pistol from the early 1930s until the mid-1950s. It was also used in the Yugoslavian Zastava M57 pistol, and the Czech ČZ vz. 52, which was the standard Czech service pistol from 1952 until 1982. In addition, the cartridge was used in numerous submachine guns, including the Soviet PPD-40, PPSh-41, and PPS-43, the Russian PP-19 Bizon, the East German WG66, the Czech Sa 24 and Sa 26. Norinco of China makes a line of Sig-Sauer clones including the NP762 chambered in 7.62×25mm Tokarev.

One of the strangest weapons attempted for this cartridge was the LAD light machine gun (5.6 kg empty weight, 960 mm length), developed the Soviet designers V.F. Lyuty, N.M. Afanasyev and V.S. Daykin during 1942–1943. Only two prototypes were built and it was not accepted for service.

Outside COMECON countries it is not so common; however after the Cold War, many firearms, especially pistols, were exported and the round is still in production. The cartridge was also used in the Russian OTs-27 Berdysh and OTs-39 submachine gun, the North Vietnamese K-50M and VPA/Viet Minh modified MAT-49s, Czech Sa 23 and the Yugoslav M49 and M56, the latter gun being developed from the design of the German MP40. Aftermarket conversion kits are also available for many firearms including the AR and AK platforms so they may fire the Tokarev round.

<doc id="1034081" wikidata="Q2474186" url="?curid=1034081" title="Waterville, County Kerry">
<text>Waterville, historically known as Coirean (), is a village in County Kerry, Ireland, on the Iveragh Peninsula. The town is sited on a narrow isthmus, with Lough Currane on the east side of the town, and Ballinskelligs Bay on the west, and the Currane River connecting the two.

The N70 Ring of Kerry route passes through the town. As of the 2022 CSO census, Waterville had a population of 555.

==Name==
The town&#x27;s name in Irish, &quot;Coireán&quot;, means &quot;little cauldron&quot; or &quot;little whirlpool&quot;, and refers to the shape of Ballinskelligs Bay on which the town sits. This name, however, has been transplanted onto the lake with the lake&#x27;s Irish name being &quot;Loch Luíoch&quot; or &quot;Loch Luidheach&quot;.

The Butler family built a house at the mouth of the River Currane in the latter part of the 18th century. They named their house and estate Waterville. The village that developed on the estate during the first half of the 19th century was also named Waterville.

==History==
===Pre-history===
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area include a megalithic tomb at Eightercua. This four-stone alignment (stone-row) is located 1.5 km south-south-east of the village.

===Telegraphy===
The first successful transatlantic cable was finally laid after a number of attempts in 1865 by the Anglo American Telegraph Company between Heart&#x27;s Content in Newfoundland and Labrador and Valentia Island near Waterville.

Waterville&#x27;s role in transatlantic communication came later when in the 1880s, the Mackay-Bennett Commercial Cable Company laid their first Transatlantic telegraph cable from the nearby townland of Spunkane to Hazel Hill, near Canso, Nova Scotia. The cable station brought much activity to Waterville and additional housing was built to accommodate the telegraph company personnel who settled in the area. Waterville served as the principal European hub for the Commercial Cable Company.

====Telegraph cables====
On 13 July 1866, &quot;SS Great Eastern&quot; steamed westward from Valentia Island laying telegraph cable behind her. The successful landing at Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland on 27 July, established the first telegraph link between Europe and North America.

Later, additional cables were laid from Valentia Island and new stations opened at Ballinskelligs (1874) and Waterville (1884) making County Kerry a focal point for intercontinental communication. The Commercial Cable Company were able to lay cables from Waterville to Canso, Nova Scotia, with onward connections. Connections from Waterville to Weston-super-Mare in England and Le Havre in France were soon established. During the Civil War, the communication system between Paris and New York went down on 7 August 1922 when IRA irregulars seized Waterville.

In July 2000, the cable stations received an International Milestone Heritage Site Award from the IEEE (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers Inc USA) for their significance in the history of electrical science. The Kerry cable stations are recognised as World Heritage Communications Sites.

Waterville&#x27;s cable station history is outlined in an exhibition in the Tech Amergin centre, and the remaining structures and locations feature in the Waterville Heritage Trail.

===Coastal erosion===
The town has been fighting back against coastal erosion since the early 20th century.

== Community ==
Charlie Chaplin and his family first visited the town in 1959. They then returned to holiday in the town every year for over ten years. The community continued the connection to Chaplin by obtaining permission from the Charlie Chaplin estate to hold the inaugural Charlie Chaplin Comedy Film Festival in the spirit of Charlie Chaplin. The first festival was held in August 2011.

The Tech Amergin adult education centre (named after Amergin Glúingel, a mythical explorer to the area) is used as a venue for events, shows and exhibitions, and vocational training.

==Sport==
Waterville Golf links was voted the 35th best golf course in UK and Ireland, in 2022. The newer Hogs Head Golf Club was named &quot;Best New International Course&quot; in 2018 by Golf Magazine.

Waterville GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. The club&#x27;s facilities have been rebuilt and include a gym and public running track.

==Notable people==
*Charlie Chaplin and his family visited the town as a favoured holiday spot. There is a statue of Chaplin in the centre of the village in his memory.
*Brian Lucey, Irish economist.
*Mick O&#x27;Dwyer, Gaelic footballer and manager, is from the area. There is also a statue to O&#x27;Dwyer in the town.
*The Marquess of Lansdowne, the Hartopps and the Butlers were landowners and landlords in the area. Both the Hartopps and Butlers were considered helpful to tenants and created local employment. In a tourist guide of the 1860s, the Hartopp Arms Hotel and Butler&#x27;s Arms were described as &quot;stately&quot; and &quot;comfortable&quot; respectively. The Hartopp Arms, later known as the Southern Lake Hotel, was demolished and the Waterville Lake Hotel constructed in its place at the beginning of the 1970s.
*John Moores, the future owner of Littlewoods football pools, mail order and stores was based in Waterville between November 1920 and May 1922 when employed as a telegraphist.
*Samantha Power, an Irish-born American diplomat, has relatives from the village, owns a holiday home in the area, and was married in Waterville.

<doc id="1034084" wikidata="Q1082143" url="?curid=1034084" title="Adolf Hitler in popular culture">
<text>Adolf Hitler, dictator of Germany from 1933 to 1945, has been represented in popular culture ever since he became a well-known politician in Germany. His distinctive image was often parodied by his opponents. Parodies became much more prominent outside Germany during his period in power. Since the end of World War II representations of Hitler, both serious and satirical, have continued to be prominent in popular culture, sometimes generating significant controversy. In many periodicals, books, and movies, Hitler and Nazism fulfill the role of archetypal evil. This treatment is not confined to fiction but is widespread amongst nonfiction writers who have discussed him in this vein. Hitler has retained a fascination from other perspectives; among many comparable examples is an exhibition at the German Historical Museum which was widely attended.

==Depictions of Hitler during his lifetime==

Numerous works in popular music and literature feature Adolf Hitler prominently.

In Germany, before he gained power, Hitler was often portrayed satirically in newspaper cartoons and propaganda by political enemies. The photomontagist John Heartfield regularly depicted Hitler in absurd ways in his anti-Nazi poster designs. After the Nazis came to national power in January 1933, Hitler was mostly depicted as a god-like figure, loved and respected by the German people, as shown for example in the Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (1935), which Hitler co-produced.

An exception was the German Fritz Lang film &quot;Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse&quot; (&quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot;) from 1933, which was banned by the Nazi propaganda ministry. Many critics consider Fritz Lang&#x27;s depiction of a homicidal maniac masterminding a criminal empire from within the walls of a criminal asylum to be an allegory of the Nazi ascent to power in Germany.

Outside Germany Hitler&#x27;s persona was often parodied. The George Bernard Shaw play &quot;Geneva&quot; (1936) includes a caricature of Hitler as &quot;Herr Battler&quot;, appearing at an international tribunal with his friends &quot;Signor Bombardone&quot; (Mussolini) and &quot;General Flanco&quot; (Franco). Numerous cartoons satirize his distinctive features, such as those by David Low.

===After the start of the war===

Another early example of a cryptic depiction is in the Bertolt Brecht play &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; (1941), in which Hitler, in the persona of the principal character Arturo Ui, a Chicago racketeer in the cauliflower trade, is ruthlessly satirised. Brecht, who was German, but left when the Nazis came to power, also expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in other plays such as &quot;Mother Courage&quot; and &quot;Fear and Misery of the Third Reich&quot;.

Outside Germany, Hitler was made fun of or depicted as a maniac. There are many notable examples in contemporary Hollywood films. Several Three Stooges shorts, the first being &quot;You Nazty Spy!&quot; (1940), the very first Hollywood work lampooning Hitler and the Nazis in which the boys, with Moe Howard portraying &quot;Moe Hailstone&quot;, as the Hitler character, are made dictators of the fictional country of Moronika. This short in particular implies that business interests were behind Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, and was said to be Moe Howard&#x27;s and Larry Fine&#x27;s favorite Stooges short subject. A sequel was released a year later entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Heil Again&quot;. This one illustrated the disagreements between Hitler and the League of Nations. In other Three Stooges shorts, Hitler is referred to as &quot;Schicklgruber&quot; in reference to his father Alois Hitler&#x27;s birth name. First released some nine months after the Stooges&#x27; initial Nazi-lampooning short subject, Charlie Chaplin made fun of Hitler as &quot;Adenoid Hynkel&quot;, the buffoonish dictator of Tomainia, in his film &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940). This is one of the most recognizable Hitler parodies.
Especially during World War II, Hitler was caricatured in numerous animated shorts, including &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot;, a 1942 Disney wartime propaganda cartoon featuring Donald Duck (inspired by Spike Jones&#x27; playing of the song written by Oliver Wallace), and the Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Herr Meets Hare&quot; featuring Bugs Bunny. However, Hitler&#x27;s first appearance on a Warner Brothers cartoon was in &quot;Bosko&#x27;s Picture Show&quot; in 1933 in a short gag where Hitler is shown chasing after Jimmy Durante with an ax. George Grosz painted &quot;Cain, or Hitler in Hell&quot; (1944) showing the dead attacking Hitler in Hell. The photomontage artist John Heartfield made frequent use of Hitler&#x27;s image as a target for his brand of barbed satire during Hitler&#x27;s lifetime. In Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1941 movie &quot;Man Hunt&quot;, which opened in theaters before America&#x27;s entry into the war, Hitler is seen in the scope of a British hunter&#x27;s rifle. In Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s 1942 films &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (as well as in Mel Brooks&#x27; remake in 1983), an actor from a Polish stage group impersonates Hitler to enable the escape of the troupe to England.
One spoof of Hitler appeared in a short propaganda film created in 1942 by Charles A. Ridley of the British Ministry of Information that had among other names, &quot;Schichlegruber - Doing the Lambeth Walk&quot; and &quot;Lambeth Walk – Nazi Style&quot;. The film features footage of Hitler and other Nazis taken from &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; and edited in such a way to make it appear they are marching and dancing to &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot;, a dance common at the time (including in Germany) but despised by the Nazis. The use of the footage was intended to give audiences is Britain and other Allied countries a good laugh and make Nazis angry. The film was distributed uncredited to various newsreel companies that gave the film other titles such as &quot;Hoch der Lambeth Valk: A Laugh-Time Interlude&quot;, &quot;Lambeth Walk - Nazi Style&quot;, &quot;Gen. Adolf Takes Over&quot; and &quot;Panzer Ballet&quot;. The newsreel companies would supply their own narration for the clip. When Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels saw this film, he ended up so enraged that he left the screening room kicking chairs and screaming profanities.

Apart from films, Hitler was the enemy of several comic book superheroes who battled Hitler directly or indirectly in comics published during World War II. Superheroes that fought Hitler include Superman, Captain America, the Shield, and Namor the Sub-Mariner. The front cover of &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1, the first Captain America comic showed Captain America hitting Hitler on the jaw. Captain America&#x27;s archenemy, the Red Skull, was established as being an apprentice to Hitler. In &quot;Superman&quot; #15 the dictator Razan appeared, who attempted to invade a nearby democratic nation. Superman defeated his army, and Razan was shot while trying to escape.

One Superman story where Superman defeats Hitler is notable for triggering a response in an official Nazi media outlet. The story was called &quot;How Superman would end the War&quot; and was published not in a comic book but in Look magazine in 1940. The story was published with the full cooperation of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the creators of the Superman character. Both Siegel and Shuster were Jewish and therefore are considered enemies by Nazi Germany so while the United States was still officially neutral, Siegel and Shuster were not. &quot;How Superman would end the War&quot; is acknowledged in the magazine itself as outside of normal Superman continuity and non-canon. As implied by its title, &quot;How Superman would end the War&quot; is a story detailing a hypothetical scenario in which Superman intervenes in World War II. The story starts in the Siegfried Line where German soldiers see Superman flying towards them. Superman then lands and while the soldiers shoot at him, the bullets have no effect and bounce off. Superman puts an artillery gun out of service by using his super strength to tie a knot into the gun&#x27;s barrel. After that, Superman flies away and when an airplane tries to stop him, he tears off the propeller, confusing the pilot. Superman continues his flight where he lands in Berlin and kidnaps Hitler (who complains about his kidnapping). Superman, while holding on to Hitler, flies to Moscow in the Soviet Union where he kidnaps another dictator, Joseph Stalin (at this point not yet in the war, he was against Hitler starting from 1941 onwards) and flies them both to the Palace of Nations, the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Hitler and Stalin are then both put on trial for war crimes including among others, the Nazi-Soviet joint occupation of Poland. This trial thus ends the war.

A Nazi in the United States had read the &quot;Look&quot; issue and Superman comic strip within it when it was published and alerted the SS newspaper &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; to its contents. In April 1940, &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; published an article condemning the comic strip, Superman and his co-creator Jerry Siegel personally. The article, titled &quot;Jerry Siegel Attacks!&quot; criticizes Superman as someone &quot;with an overdeveloped body and underdeveloped mind&quot; and in typical Nazi fashion, repeatedly uses anti-Semitic language to describe the story and denounce Siegel. Such language includes the opening sentence where Siegel is described as &quot;an intellectually and physically circumcised chap&quot;. The article is also an attack on Siegel&#x27;s own morals, claiming that he only created Superman to make money off him. Superman is further condemned when it mentions the scene of Hitler and Stalin handed over to the League of Nations and noting his superhero costume probably breaks the dress code in the building but that Superman ignores those rules &quot;as well as the other laws of physics, logic, and life in general&quot;. The article ends with a final attack on Siegel where &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; describes him as feeding &quot;poison&quot; on a daily basis to the hearts and minds of American children.

Hitler was mocked in satirical folk songs such as &quot;Stalin Wasn&#x27;t Stallin&#x27; or when new lyrics were created to old songs such as &quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot; (to the tune of the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;).

==Representations of Hitler after his death==
The 2003 television film &quot;&quot; stars Robert Carlyle in the title role and depicts a semi-fictional account of Hitler&#x27;s life.

&quot;Moloch&quot; (1999), directed by Alexander Sokurov, starring Leonid Mozgovoy, deals with Hitler&#x27;s life on his &quot;Berghof&quot; mountain retreat near Berchtesgaden during the war, drawing heavily from Hitler&#x27;s Table Talk published after the war.

Hitler&#x27;s last days have been depicted in several films, first in &quot;Der letzte Akt&quot; (1955), directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, starring Albin Skoda as the dictator; next was the fifth and final installment of the Soviet film series &quot;Liberation&quot; (1969–72), directed by Yuri Ozerov, starring Fritz Diez (an actor who commonly portrayed Hitler in a number of East German films from 1955 onwards). &quot;The Death of Adolf Hitler&quot;, a British (7 January 1973) made-for-television production, starring Frank Finlay in the title role, and &quot;&quot; (1973), directed by Ennio De Concini, starring Sir Alec Guinness were the first Western contributions. The fifth iteration was the U.S. television film &quot;The Bunker&quot; (1981), directed by George Schaefer, starring Sir Anthony Hopkins. Finally, there was the Academy Award–nominated &quot;Downfall&quot; (2004), directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and starring Bruno Ganz as Hitler. Also depicting Hitler&#x27;s final hour in the bunker, the short film &quot;Hundert Jahre Adolf Hitler - Die letzte Stunde im Führerbunker&quot; (1989), directed by Christoph Schlingensief, starring Udo Kier, cannot be considered a remake of the above films in the proper sense.

Hitler was portrayed in the television miniseries &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot; (1982) by Sir Derek Jacobi, who was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance. Hitler was also portrayed in the film &quot;Valkyrie&quot; by David Bamber, which tells the story of the July 1944 bomb attempt on his life.

Another example of Hitler representations are comedy films such as Mel Brooks&#x27; comedy &quot;The Producers&quot; featured a satirical play-within-a-play called &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;, featuring dancing Nazis and songs about the conquest of Europe. Brooks&#x27; later comedy, &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;, featured &quot;Hitler on Ice.&quot;

Hitler has also been portrayed in experimental films. &quot;&quot; (1978), a four part, 442-minute experimental film on Hitler, directed by Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, starring Heinz Schubert. A similar non-linear approach to Syberberg&#x27;s, likening Hitler to a movie director as well, was used in the film &quot;The Empty Mirror&quot; (1996), directed by Barry J. Hershey, starring Norman Rodway, which speculates about Hitler surviving World War II, living in a secret subterranean bunker, and is today undergoing psychoanalysis conducted by Sigmund Freud.

Kosovar Emin Xhinovci has attracted considerable media attention for his striking resemblance to Hitler, and subsequent impersonation of him.
&quot;Him&quot; (2001) is a sculpture resembling a schoolboy kneeling in prayer, except that the head has been replaced with the realistic likeness of Adolf Hitler. The sculpture was frequently displayed at the end of a long hallway or at the opposite end of a white room, turned away from the viewer so that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to recognize the individual until they advanced close enough.
The artist&#x27;s proof of &quot;Him&quot; (2001) was sold at auction by Christie&#x27;s in 2016 for $17,189,000.

===Theatre===

Hitler made it onto the stage through Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima, who wrote a play called &quot;My Friend Hitler&quot; (&quot;Wagatomo Hitora&quot;), retelling the Night of the Long Knives. Moreover, the Hungarian writer George Tabori wrote a comedy called &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; which portrayed Hitler as a poor young man who enters Vienna, wanting to become an artist. Hitler appears as a minor character in Stanley Eveling&#x27;s &quot;The Dead of Night&quot;, set above the Führerbunker as the Russians are entering Berlin. &quot;Dr Freud Will See You Now Mr Hitler&quot; (2008) was a radio drama by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran presenting an imagined scenario in which Sigmund Freud treats the young Hitler. Toby Jones played Hitler. Utpal Dutt&#x27;s 1975 Bengali play &quot;Barricade&quot; is set in the time that Hitler is rising to power.

In 2021, Gamma Ray Theatre launched their debut production &quot;Ay Up, Hitler!&quot; Written by Hampshire playwright David McCulloch, the play tells the untold &quot;true&quot; story of how Hitler and other high-ranking members of the Third Reich, actually escaped Germany at the end of the war, and went into hiding in Yorkshire. The play was praised for its &#x27;outrageous satire&#x27; and was described as a &#x27;riotous hour of innovative theatre.&#x27; It made its Edinburgh Fringe Debut in 2023, achieving a sell-out run.

=== Comics and cartoons ===

DC Comics feature Hitler on several occasions. In &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #3 (December 1950-January 1951), there is a story in which Hitler is captured by space aliens just before his attempted suicide. A fake corpse is left for the SS to find. As punishment for Hitler&#x27;s crimes, he is imprisoned for life alone on a rocket ship which will travel through space until he dies (the rocket ship can automatically manufacture its own food for him); during his waking hours, he is forced to listen to an endless loop recording of all the speeches he has ever made. The character known as the Unknown Soldier, who first appeared in June 1966, kills Hitler, impersonates him for a short time, then pretends his death was a suicide. In &quot;Adventures of the Outsiders&quot; #33-35, a clone of Hitler is created by Baron Bedlam. Planning to give the clone the same persona as the original, Bedlam gives him an intellectually disabled Jewish maid, several films of the Holocaust and a handgun, Bedlam&#x27;s intention being for the clone to embrace Nazism and ultimately murder the maid to &quot;prove himself&quot; as Hitler. Instead, the clone—realizing his connection to the atrocities he views—commits suicide.

In DC Comics&#x27; Elseworlds imprint, &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, Hitler&#x27;s brain is successfully transplanted into the brain pan of Dyna-Mite. Now pretending to be a superhero called Dynaman, he plots in resurrecting Nazi ideals with the aid of the Ultra-Humanite. He possessed a magical item, the Spear of Destiny, which gave him control over superpowered beings that entered Nazi territory, an explanation for why the Justice Society of America did not enter Berlin and end the war.

In Fawcett Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; comics, he was a member of the Monster Society of Evil with Benito Mussolini and Hideki Tojo, and other Nazis like (List of Captain Marvel (DC Comics) enemies) Herr Phoul were other members of the Society. He was shown to have helped in the creation of super-strong Aryan supervillain Captain Nazi.

In &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; #58 (1977) &quot;Death of a dictator&quot; Hitler kills a raving man dressed in rags before going into suspended animation in the belief history will repeat and he will be able to rebuild the Third Reich. The story ends with our Hitler with long hair being killed in exactly the same manner the raving man dressed in rags was. The final panel reveals that the scientist was all too correct in that history would repeat as our Hitler&#x27;s killer looks exactly like he did originally and he is going to his suspended animation chamber and these events will replay themselves...forever.

In the comic book &quot;The Savage Dragon&quot; by Erik Larsen (published by Image Comics), Hitler did not die in 1945, but after a fight against Hellboy in Romania in 1952. His body ruined, the brain is transplanted to the body of a large gorilla. Suffering amnesia and calling himself Brainiape, the chimera possesses great psionic powers and joins the Chicago, IL criminal organization known as the Vicious Circle, eventually becoming its leader. He remembers his past only in 1996 when he encounters Hellboy again, alongside the Vicious Circle&#x27;s enemy, the meta-talented policeman called Dragon. The ape body is killed, and it is revealed that Hitler&#x27;s brain had mutated and could live unaided by any technology or host body, ambulatory on tiny legs.

Marvel Comics&#x27; villain the Hate-Monger is revealed to be the consciousness of Hitler transferred to a cloned body by Nazi scientist Arnim Zola. The original Hitler, rather than committing suicide, was confronted by the Human Torch and his sidekick Toro after Eva Braun committed suicide. The two heroes set Hitler ablaze as he attempted to set off a bomb. As he died, he commanded one of his loyal followers nearby to tell the world he had committed suicide. The clone is killed in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #21 when the Invisible Girl makes him hit his own troops with his hate-ray, causing them to shoot him for getting them into a battle with the Fantastic Four. At the time of his death, he was planning to start wars using a ray which caused hatred and to which only he possessed the antidote to, having started with a South American country. He preached ideas of bigotry also while in America. In another story, Hitler is seen in the Hellish realm of the demon Mephisto.
In the British comic &quot;2000 AD&quot; a storyline called The Shicklgruber Grab from &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; mutant bounty hunters Johnny Alpha and Wulf Sternhammer are hired to go back to 1945 and bring Hitler to the future the stand trial, Hitler who murdered Eva Braun shortly after marrying her, and used his simpleton body double to commit suicide so he could escape and start the Fourth Reich, however gets dragged to the future not understanding what&#x27;s going on.

Warner Bros. produced wartime cartoons which constantly parodied Hitler and his personality traits and quirks. Most (if not all) cartoons with Hitler and the Nazis as the antagonists ended up with the American hero cartoon character (such as Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck) making a mockery out of Hitler.
Japanese manga artist Shigeru Mizuki wrote &quot;Gekiga Hitler&quot;, first serialized in &quot;Weekly Manga Sunday&quot; in 1971 and published in English in 2015 as &quot;Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s Hitler&quot; by Drawn &amp; Quarterly.

The episode &quot;Alternative Histories&quot;, from the Netflix animated series &quot;Love, Death &amp; Robots&quot;, centers in five scenarios where an alternative death of the dictator occurs.

In the comic book series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; by Alan Moore, set in an alternate universe where several other works of fiction are real, Adenoid Hynkel, the Hitler spoof played by Charlie Chaplin in his film &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;, is a real person and has the same role in the comic series that Hitler had in real life. In the world of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, Tomainia (the country Hynkel ruled in &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;) was annexed by Nazi Germany in a similar manner to the Anschluss and the &quot;Double Cross&quot; emblem used in the film for Hynkel-controlled Tomainia is instead used as the Nazi flag instead of the Swastika in reality, meaning that this version of Hynkel isn&#x27;t exactly the same as the film. The personality of the comic book Hynkel combines the buffoonish mentality of the film Hynkel with the evil tyranny of Hitler both in real life and in the various fictional works that depict him. Hynkel is mentioned in passing in &quot;Volume III: Century&quot; but only appears as a character in &quot;Nemo: The Roses of Berlin&quot; which is part of the &quot;Nemo Trilogy&quot;. &quot;Nemo: The Roses of Berlin&quot; also mentions that an American comedian named &quot;Addie Hitler&quot; has made a movie that mocked Hynkel&#x27;s regime, an obvious reference to &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;.

Belgian comic series The Adventures of Nero shows two incarnations of Hitler having survived the war: once in &quot;De man met het gouden hoofd&quot; where he is pictured living hidden in an igloo in the American Far North, and again in &quot;Het knalgele koffertje&quot; which pictures him on an unidentified Pacific Island.

==Hitler in music==
Many songs tell a story about Hitler one way or the other, for example &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; by Stratovarius directly mentions the history of Hitler and the Nazi regime. David Bowie has also been quoted saying &quot;Hitler was the first rock star&quot; and, at one time, wanted to direct a film based on the life of Heinrich Himmler. &quot;Heads We&#x27;re Dancing&quot; by Kate Bush tells the story of a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger, only to discover the following morning that he is Adolf Hitler. Texas Groove metal band Pantera wrote and recorded a song called &quot;By Demons Be Driven&quot;. It tells the story of how Hitler was plagued by paranoia and began to hate the Jewish people and religion. Australian band TISM&#x27;s debut single was &quot;Defecate on My Face&quot;, which was about Adolf Hitler&#x27;s supposed coprophilia. Australian comedy troupe the Doug Anthony Allstars had a song called &quot;Mexican Hitler&quot;, which told the story of what Hitler would have been like if he was born Mexican. It made an appearance in their television show, &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot;.

The song &quot;Hitler as Kalki&quot; by apocalyptic folk band Current 93 makes use of Savitri Devi&#x27;s idea that Hitler was an avatar of the Hindu god Kalki. &quot;Two Little Hitlers&quot; by Elvis Costello, superficially a song about a loveless couple but reportedly a real-life reflection of the relationship between the singer and his producer Nick Lowe (who had previously recorded a song entitled &quot;Little Hitler&quot;, the similarities leading to speculations about the origins of the later song) on the album &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. Antony and the Johnsons have released the song &quot;Hitler in My Heart&quot; on their debut in which the term &quot;Hitler&quot; is generally used as a metaphore for the bad within oneself - likewise in the song &quot;Crack Hitler&quot; by Faith No More from Angel Dust.

American rapper Westside Gunn released a series of mixtapes named &quot;Hitler Wears Hermes&quot;. He later said that the title was inspired by the movie The Devil Wears Prada.

Other songs take a more serious approach and deal with Hitler&#x27;s impact on the world. Thrash metal group Flotsam and Jetsam recorded the song &quot;Der Fuhrer&quot; for their album &quot;Doomsday for the Deceiver&quot;. The song discusses the devastation Hitler caused in Europe. New York metal band Anthrax recorded the song &quot;The Enemy&quot; for their album &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;. The song discusses Hitler&#x27;s role in the Holocaust.

There are some examples of parodies involving Hitler. Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters reference Hitler in the song, Hot Time in the Town of Berlin. &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; is an elaborate parody on Nazism created by musical comedian Spike Jones. It is one of his most well-known tunes. A novelty rap song entitled &quot;To Be or Not to Be (The Hitler Rap)&quot; performed by Mel Brooks is on the movie &quot;To Be or Not to Be&#x27;s&quot; soundtrack album, but it was not in the movie itself. Mel Brooks dressed as Hitler sings from behind a desk while male dancers in pants, harnesses and SS caps made of black leather and female dancers in fishnet stockings dance wildly with each other around Hitler on a large dance floor with a checkerboard design.

Songs about Adolf Hitler include:
*&quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; by Clifford Morris, better known as the Mighty Destroyer
*&quot;Mr. Hitler&quot; by Lead Belly
*&quot;Hot Time in the Town of Berlin&quot; by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters 
*&quot;Defecate on My Face&quot;, by TISM
*&quot;Even Hitler Had a Girlfriend&quot; by Mr. T Experience
*&quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; by Spike Jones
*&quot;Heads We&#x27;re Dancing&quot; by Kate Bush
*&quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot; — World War II British soldiers marching song
*&quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; from the film and play &quot;The Producers&quot; by Mel Brooks

==Internet==
Parodied clips from the 2004 film &quot;Downfall&quot; have proliferated internationally via YouTube and other video sites. The parodies replace the subtitles from the original movie with incorrect subtitles. The most frequently used clips include the scene where Hitler receives news of the advancing Red Army vastly outnumbering the forces commanded by Felix Steiner, and where Hitler orders Otto Günsche to find SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Hermann Fegelein. They are subtitled with references to Hitler becoming angry over various facets of modern pop culture such as politics, online gaming, movies, television, music, sports and many other local or international events.

The phenomenon started in English but has spread to other languages including Japanese (massive number of videos on Nico Nico Douga on various topics), Chinese (influenced by Japan, comments on Wenzhou train collision and many other sensational topics mainly on Tudou and Youku. In addition, Hong Kong people used the clip to criticize social events, like Cable TV un-subscription, salt shortage due to misbelief of salt being able to protect from radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster), Bulgarian (to ridicule Bulgarian president Georgi Parvanov for being a State Security agent during the communist dictatorship and for being a poacher), Romanian (for the 2009 presidential election), Croatian (comments about frequent affairs in the government), Serbian (regarding poor results by football team FK Red Star), French (about the weather), Spanish (about a wide variety of topics mainly related to Argentine and Chilean local events), Indonesian (mainly about local politics, presidential elections, cultures, and also everyday life), and Hebrew (about the difficulty of finding parking space in Tel Aviv).

Footage and/or characters from other films, ranging from other depictions of Hitler in the likes of &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; or &quot;&quot;, or even films that have little or nothing to do with &quot;Downfall&quot;, are also juxtaposed for humorous effect.

On April 21, 2010, Constantin Film, the production and distribution company responsible for the film, initiated a massive removal of parody videos on YouTube. This removal was criticized by digital rights advocates and was followed by the appearance of self-referential parody videos on the very subject of Constantin&#x27;s actions with respect to the parodies.

In the shared alternate history of Ill Bethisad (1997 and after), Adolf Hitler never went into politics but instead moved to New Amsterdam (Ill Bethisad&#x27;s version of New York City) and wrote science fiction, in a similar manner to the version of Hitler depicted in the novel &quot;The Iron Dream&quot;. Unlike in real life or &quot;The Iron Dream&quot;, the fictional alternate universe of Hitler was never anti-Semitic. Hitler actually &quot;liked&quot; the Jewish people he met early in life in Vienna, preventing his anti-Semitism. Hitler also created the alternate history genre in Ill Bethisad and his most famous work there, &quot;The Dream of Iron&quot;, is an example of one. The villains of &quot;The Dream of Iron&quot; are the &quot;Empire of Zand&quot; which resemble the Nazis.

The website Cats That Look Like Hitler features pictures of cats that bear some resemblance to the German leader.

Godwin&#x27;s Law states &quot;As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one&quot;. From this is derived an additional formulation, also encountered online, which states &quot;The first person to mention the Third Reich automatically loses the argument&quot;.

In 2010, Hitler has been portrayed by EpicLLOYD in the second episode of YouTube series &quot;Epic Rap Battles of History&quot;, &quot;Darth Vader vs Hitler&quot;, where he faces Darth Vader (portrayed by co-creator Nice Peter) in a rap battle. In 2011, in Season two&#x27;s first episode, &quot;Hitler vs. Vader 2&quot;, EpicLLOYD and Nice Peter reprised their roles in a second rap battle between Darth Vader and Hitler and again for the start of season three, in the episode &quot;Hitler vs. Vader 3&quot;, which was uploaded on October 7, 2013, on the series&#x27; YouTube channel.

In 2012, an Internet meme statement &quot;HDNW&quot; is an Internet meme statement used for trolling purposes for Adolf Hitler denial, who was responsible for during his reign were morally wrong, and for Holocaust denial. It was made by 4chan, which hijacked the campaign of Mountain Dew.

In 2013, a kettle, which was dubbed the &quot;Hitler teapot&quot;, went viral on Reddit and other social media sites because of its apparent resemblance to Hitler.

==Video games==

The first part of Wolfenstein 3D culminates in a battle with Adolf Hitler in a robotic suit.

Adolf Hitler appears as a target in the &quot;Sniper Elite&quot; series during DLC missions.

&quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot; features Adolf Hitler in the 1960s after Nazis win World War II. It is revealed B.J. Blazkowicz assassinated Hitler during the Second American Revolution.

==Art==
Salvador Dalí painted several pictures involving Hitler. &quot;The Enigma of Hitler&quot; (1939) depicts a torn photograph of Hitler on a plate in a typically surreal landscape over which hangs a broken telephone and an umbrella. He also painted the &quot;Metamorphosis of the Face of Hitler into a Moonlit Landscape&quot; (1958). One of his late works was &quot;Hitler Masturbating&quot; (1973), depicting just that, with Hitler seen from behind in an armchair in the center of a snow-filled desolate landscape.

Hitler is depicted in a balloon overlooking marching, helmeted troops in the painting &quot;Vision of War&quot; by Indian artist A. Ramachandran. A picture of him with Gandhi by M. F. Husain was controversial with Hindutva groups in India.

==In India==
The name &quot;Hitler&quot; is widely used for anyone who is overly authoritarian in manner, but it does not have the same negative connotation as it does in the West. For example, in the 1998 film &quot;Hitler&quot;, the disciplinarian hero nicknamed Hitler is simply a person with staunch traditional values. There are at least three other Indian films titled &quot;Hitler&quot;, in all of which the Hitler character is the hero: &quot;Hitler&quot; (1996), &quot;Hitler&quot; (1997), &quot;Hitler Umanath&quot;. &quot;Hitler Didi&quot; (My Sister Hitler) is a TV show about a character with a domineering elder sister.

In Indian popular culture, Hitler is synonymous with rigidity; people often refer to their boss or a strict teacher as Hitler.

Hitler is also used as a personal name in India, as in the case of the politician Adolf Lu Hitler Marak. The film &quot;Hero Hitler in Love&quot; is about a man called &quot;Hitler&quot; who tries to love everyone. Furthermore, the swastika has for centuries been a common symbol in India with positive connotations. According to &quot;The Indian Republic&quot;,

According to Navras Jaat Aafreedi, such references to Hitler are not usually linked to pro-Nazi sympathies, but some Hindu nationalist groups see Hitler&#x27;s use of the swastika as a &quot;great service to Hinduism&quot; and link anti-Semitic ideology to anti-Islamism.

The &quot;Hitler&quot; clothing store in Ahmedabad in Gujarat opened in mid-August 2012. The store immediately became embroiled in controversy over its name. The store&#x27;s logo even had a swastika embedded in the dot above the &quot;i&quot; in Hitler&#x27;s name. The owner, Rajesh Shah, told media he did not expect all the commotion. He had chosen the name because the grandfather of his business partner was nicknamed &quot;Hitler&quot; because of his strict demeanor. He stated he did not intend to change the name unless somebody else paid the expenses. Among the groups that objected to the store&#x27;s name was the small Jewish community in Ahmedabad. A diplomat at the Israeli embassy in New Delhi said that the embassy would protest in &quot;the strongest terms possible&quot; to the Indian government. The Israeli consul general in Mumbai asked state officials to ensure the store was renamed, but commented that she believes the use of the name most likely is a product of ignorance rather than antisemitism. Reports suggested that the shop owner had agreed to rename the store following an offer by a Jewish organization to pay the costs. In October 2012 the Ahmedabad Municipal authorities allegedly removed the store sign without proper procedure. It was later renamed &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

Cross Cafe in Mumbai was formerly Hitler&#x27;s Cross cafe. The business sought to attract attention by using the Hitler theme, and was decorated with Nazi imagery. Actor Murli Sharma attended the opening party; when asked what he thought about the name, he said &quot;I am not really agitated as I have not read much about the man. However, from what I know about Hitler, I find this name rather amusing.&quot; Alternative names suggested included Stalin Samosa Shop, Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s Falafels, and Kim Jong&#x27;s Juicy Juice.

==In Thailand==
Hitler Fried Chicken was a fast-food restaurant in Thailand based on Yum! Brands Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain. The mascot of Hitler Fried Chicken is Adolf Hitler wearing a Colonel Sanders outfit. Adolf Hitler is considered &#x27;chic&#x27; by many in Thailand.

<text>In biology, a strain is a genetic variant, a subtype or a culture within a biological species. Strains are often seen as inherently artificial concepts, characterized by a specific intent for genetic isolation. This is most easily observed in microbiology where strains are derived from a single cell colony and are typically quarantined by the physical constraints of a Petri dish. Strains are also commonly referred to within virology, botany, and with rodents used in experimental studies.

== Microbiology and virology ==
It has been said that &quot;there is no universally accepted definition for the terms &#x27;strain&#x27;, &#x27;variant&#x27;, and &#x27;isolate&#x27; in the virology community, and most virologists simply copy the usage of terms from others&quot;.

A strain is a genetic variant or subtype of a microorganism (e.g., a virus, bacterium or fungus). For example, a &quot;flu strain&quot; is a certain biological form of the influenza or &quot;flu&quot; virus. These flu strains are characterized by their differing isoforms of surface proteins. New viral strains can be created due to mutation or swapping of genetic components when two or more viruses infect the same cell in nature. These phenomena are known respectively as antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Microbial strains can also be differentiated by their genetic makeup using metagenomic methods to maximize resolution within species. This has become a valuable tool to analyze the microbiome. 

=== Artificial constructs ===
Scientists have modified strains of viruses in order to study their behavior, as in the case of the H5N1 influenza virus. While funding for such research has aroused controversy at times due to safety concerns, leading to a temporary pause, it has subsequently proceeded.

In biotechnology, microbial strains have been constructed to establish metabolic pathways suitable for treating a variety of applications. Historically, a major effort of metabolic research has been devoted to the field of biofuel production. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is most common species for prokaryotic strain engineering. Scientists have succeeded in establishing viable minimal genomes from which new strains can be developed. These minimal strains provide a near guarantee that experiments on genes outside the minimal framework will not be effected by non-essential pathways. Optimized strains of &quot;E. coli&quot; are typically used for this application. &quot;E. coli&quot; are also often used as a chassis for the expression of simple proteins. These strains, such as BL21, are genetically modified to minimize protease activity, hence enabling potential for high efficiency industrial scale protein production.

Strains of yeasts are the most common subjects of eukaryotic genetic modification, especially with respect to industrial fermentation.

== Plants ==
The term has no official ranking status in botany; the term refers to the collective descendants produced from a common ancestor that share a uniform morphological or physiological character. A strain is a designated group of offspring that are either descended from a modified plant (produced by conventional breeding or by biotechnological means), or which result from genetic mutation. 

As an example, some rice strains are made by inserting new genetic material into a rice plant, all the descendants of the genetically modified rice plant are a strain with unique genetic information that is passed on to later generations; the strain designation, which is normally a number or a formal name, covers all the plants that descend from the originally modified plant. The rice plants in the strain can be bred to other rice strains or cultivars, and if desirable plants are produced, these are further bred to stabilize the desirable traits; the stabilized plants that can be propagated and &quot;come true&quot; (remain identical to the parent plant) are given a cultivar name and released into production to be used by farmers. 

==Rodents==
A laboratory mouse or rat strain is a group of animals that is genetically uniform. Strains are used in laboratory experiments. Mouse strains can be inbred, mutated, or genetically modified, while rat strains are usually inbred. A given inbred rodent population is considered genetically identical after 20 generations of sibling-mating. Many rodent strains have been developed for a variety of disease models, and they are also often used to test drug toxicity.

==Insects==

The common fruit fly (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;) was among the first organisms used for genetic analysis, has a simple genome, and is very well understood. It has remained a popular model organism for many other reasons, like the ease of its breeding and maintenance, and the speed and volume of its reproduction. Various specific strains have been developed, including a flightless version with stunted wings (also used in the pet trade as live food for small reptiles and amphibians).

<doc id="1034110" wikidata="Q2075066" url="?curid=1034110" title="Sokoke">
<text>The Sokoke (or Sokoke Forest Cat in long form, and formerly the African Shorthair) is natural breed of domestic cat, developed and standardised, beginning in the late 1970s, from the feral khadzonzo landrace of eastern, coastal Kenya. The Sokoke is recognized by four major cat pedigree registry organizations as a standardised cat breed. It is named after the Arabuko Sokoke National Forest, the environment from which the foundation stock was obtained, for breed development primarily in Denmark and the United States. The cat is long-legged, with short, coarse hair, and typically a tabby coat, though specific lineages have produced different appearances. Although once rumored to be a domestic × wildcat hybrid, genetic study has not borne out this belief. Another idea, that the variety is unusually ancient, remains unproven either way. The native population is closely related to an island-dwelling group, the Lamu cat, further north.

==Original &quot;khadzonzo&quot; landrace==

Coastal Kenya&#x27;s distinctive, free-roaming, feral cats – known as &quot;khadzonzo&quot; or &quot;kadzonzo&quot;, and found from city streets to the Arabuko Sokoke national forest – were &quot;discovered&quot;, in the Western cat fancy sense, by horse breeder and wildlife artist Jeni Slater in 1978 near Watamu coconut plantation, though of course the cats were known for much longer by native people. By that point, the rural population were thought to be nearly extinct due to human encroachment on the forest and its resources. Although there were ideas that it might be a new subspecies of wildcat, the tameness of the kittens Slater reared suggested that theoretical hybridisation with wildcats was unlikely, as did features like the long, tapered tail (not characteristic of any wild African species), a general form consistent with Asian domestic cat breeds (very unlike the cobby figure of wildcats), and the mottled, blotched coat pattern (a characteristic of urban cat populations). The feral &quot;khadzonzo&quot; were developed into a standardised breed, the Sokoke, which has a much more uniform appearance than the landrace cats.

=== Description ===
The forest population tend to consistently &quot;breed true&quot; for ticked coats in brown tones with prominent mottling with large rosette spots, which may fuse. They share this general feature with many other forest-dwelling felids, a natural form of camouflage. Aside from specific patterns, the cats in this population do not seem to vary widely in appearance. The town-dwelling population (presumably through crossbreeding with non-native cats) come in a wider variety of colours and patterns, including white-spotted coats, and some that are mostly black. The urban variety are very similar to an island population a few hundred kilometres north, the subject of a book called &quot;The Cats of Lamu&quot; (by Jack Couffer, 1998, Lyons Press). All of these populations are characterized by narrow faces compared to other African domestic cats, as well as long ears, long legs, and a lean, not cobby, body.

=== Relation to other populations ===
Couffer hypothesises that, due to their isolation and Lamu&#x27;s ancient history as a trade centre between Africa and Asia, they may be more closely related than even the Egyptian Mau breed to the original cats domesticated in the Fertile Crescent over 4,000 years ago and holding special favour in Ancient Egypt

While modern genetic work has yet to prove or disprove Couffer&#x27;s idea, a DNA study by the Cat Genome Project (CGP) at the US National Cancer Institute has determined that the spotted &quot;khadzonzo&quot; street cats of eastern Kenya, the cats of the Lamu Archipelago off the Kenyan coast, and the standardized Sokoke are all closely related. CGP categorised them in its &quot;Arabian Sea Racial Group&quot; (among a total of 12 feline &quot;race&quot; groupings). The group&#x27;s shared DNA is derived primarily from Asian domestic cats, with ancient Arabian wildcat progenitors. This dispels the suspicion of some breeders that the cats are at least part modern wildcat – they are no more wild than the rest of the domestic cats. Advances in DNA sequencing have now resulted in an ambitious whole-body sequencing effort, called the 99 Cat Genome Project, which may reveal much more about the origins of the &quot;khadzonzo&quot; and connections that it and the Sokoke has with other cat populations.

=== Status ===
The Lamu population are under pressure from a sterilisation campaign championed by recent immigrants, while the forest population have become rare for unclear reasons, and more secretive. Eight specimens (only two female) were captured for breeding from the forest in 2001; photographs show that several have very large dark blotches, somewhat reminiscent of the unrelated clouded leopard species (a trait now available in recent bloodlines of the pet breed), but share both tall ears and long body with the already-established formal breed. As with most native landrace populations of cats, these must be under threat of genetic erosion from modern cats introduced, and allowed to roam and interbreed, by foreign settlers to the area. For example, the Manx cat is nearly extinct in its homeland, the Isle of Man, being bred out by the imported cats of British and other immigrants, though the standardised form developed from the landrace is common and popular around the world. Similar threats to the Van cat have impelled the Turkish government to hastily set up an official breeding programme to save it in a more pure form than the weakly related Turkish Van and Turkish Angora standardised breeds which bear little resemblance to the landrace feral populations of Van city and the Lake Van area.

== Modern Sokoke breed ==
=== History ===
The Sokoke is a &quot;natural breed&quot;, i.e., one developed and standardised from the local, free-breeding landrace population, and thus distinct from it by virtue of careful selective breeding for specific, fixed traits believed to epitomise the distinctions evolved by natural selection in the original population. As British cat geneticist and pedigree judge Pat Turner wrote in 1993, in the early days of recognition of the breed&#x27;s standardisation, the fixing of traits like large &quot;wild-looking&quot; spots that are distinct from other blotched breeds &quot;can only be done by selective breeding&quot;.

The breeding programme was begun in 1978 by Jeni Slater, who originally named the breed the African Shorthair. She used cats found in and around Watamu, both raised from kittenhood and enticed from the adult feral population with food rewards.

Gloria Moeldrop, a friend of Slater&#x27;s, brought a pair of Slater&#x27;s cats home with her to Denmark to breed in 1983, because Slater feared for the survival of the native cat in Kenya. The cats were first shown in Copenhagen in 1984, then in Odense. 
Slater introduced a darker Watamu street cat specimen into the breeding programme, in 1987, for genetic diversity. Breeder and North American Sokoke Association officer Pat Longley has suggested that this cat introduced the lynx point pattern seen in some Sokokes. In 1989, Moeldrop imported more cats from Kenya to strengthen her European breeding stock. Slater also provided at least one to a breeder named Bob Schwartz, in Italy.

Jeannie Knocker, an Englishwoman residing near Slater in Kenya, gathered several feral cats near the borders of the forest and kept them penned, producing litters that were exported to the US and Europe, registered to establish future pedigrees, and bred; these became known as the &quot;new line&quot; Sokoke cats, with distinctive features from those of the Slater-developed &quot;old line&quot;. The cats caught in the forest from 2001 onward have been added to this breeding programme, as have some more recent specimens.

Whether extraneous (e.g., European or Asian) bloodlines were introduced by any breeders is unclear.

===Breed recognition===
The standardised breed was first recognised by a breed registry, the Belgium-based &quot;Fédération Internationale Féline&quot; (FIFe), under the name Sokoke, after the forest. This occurred in 1993, after a multi-breeder demonstration of the new breed&#x27;s consistent development at a cat show in Denmark.

The breed is also registered by The International Cat Association (TICA), based in the United States; it is eligible to be shown in the &quot;Preliminary New Breed&quot; class at TICA-sanctioned events.

The Sokoke is now also recognised by two national cat registries, the UK Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), and the Canadian Cat Association (CCA).

=== Standardised characteristics ===

The bodies of the Sokokes are medium-sized overall, long and thin, with long legs. The back legs are longer than the front legs, similar to those of a wildcat. They also have a unique tip-toe gait, in part due to a straighter as well as the longer back legs. Their eyes are usually amber to light-green, set in a comparatively small head, with long ears, reminiscent of various species of wild cat, though these are traits intentionally reinforced by artificial selection. The tail is tapered.

Sokokes typically have blotched (i.e., large-spotted) tabby coats in shades of brown, broadly similar to those of the Bengal and Ocicat. The centers or &quot;oysters&quot; of the patterns are hollow-looking due to the agouti gene, which also produces a &quot;ticked&quot; or &quot;salt and pepper&quot; look to the coat, overall. This combination has been called &quot;African tabby&quot; or &quot;African pattern&quot;, which may extend all the way to the tip of the tail. It is distinct from previously known blotched tabby patterns found in other breeds in this respect, but otherwise genetically identical, with all the normal tabby features (in cat fancier and judging terms, the patterns share the same &quot;&quot;butterflies&quot; &quot;eyeliner&quot;, &quot;bonnet strings&quot;, &quot;necklaces&quot; and other characteristic markings). A particular &quot;wood-grain&quot; look is highly prized in show cats

Their coats are short, and coarse but lustrous, with little to no undercoat. Recessive colours and traits are rare. Noted so far (and not accepted for showing by most registries) are seal lynx point (accepted for showing in GCCF), melanistic (black or near-black), and &quot;blue&quot; (i.e. grey) colours. Long-haired specimens are almost unknown. &quot;Chaotic&quot;, &quot;chained&quot;, and &quot;clouded&quot; marbling patterns have been seen with the advent of the &quot;new line&quot;, as deviations away from the earlier established modified blotched tabby pattern, but clearly based on the genetics of the landrace forest specimens from the 1990s. Perhaps owing to the admixture of city specimens, the original Slater lineage also fairly often produces small-spotted instead of blotched cats, perhaps indicating earlier crossbreeding with non-native cats (the Egyptian Mau, for example, has such a pattern).

Sokoke cats are very active and enjoy climbing. They tend to be vocal toward human keepers and other cats with whom they live. They bond deeply to each other, as well as their owners. This trait makes re-homing harder for them, with a longer adjustment period expected in adult cats and older, already-bonded kittens.

The Sokoke does best in a controlled environment, because of their limited resistance to common New World cat illnesses, often found in catteries and multi-cat homes. Like all of the short-haired Asian group of cats, they do not thrive in extreme cold temperatures for extended periods of time. However, contrary to previous reports, they can be acclimated to colder climates, and do not require special housing any more than similar short-haired, Asian-group cats.

Their expected lifespan is the same as any purebred domestic cat, with 15 years an average old age.

===Breeding===
It is typical for the male to help raise the kittens, getting in the nest box with them.
If left together, the mother will often wait months to wean her kittens, even though their development is fairly rapid once they leave the nest box.
Breeders expect one to two litters per year, per breeding pair. Sometimes two litters may come closely in a row, with a longer period of time before further reproduction. Sexual maturity is usually reached at around eight to ten months of age.

<text>Anne Jemima Clough (20 January 182027 February 1892) was an early English suffragist and a promoter of higher education for women. She was the first principal of Newnham College.

==Life==
Clough was born at Liverpool, Lancashire, the daughter of cotton merchant James Butler Clough and Anne (née Perfect). James Butler Clough was a younger son of a landed gentry family that had been living at Plas Clough in Denbighshire since 1567.

Anne&#x27;s brother was Arthur Hugh Clough, the poet and assistant to Florence Nightingale. When two years old she was taken with the rest of the family to Charleston, South Carolina. It was not till 1836 that she returned to Britain.

Anne&#x27;s own education was entirely at home, as was common for middle and upper-class women of the time. She worked as a volunteer in a Liverpool charity school and became determined to run a school of her own.

When her father became bankrupt in 1841, she took the opportunity to set up a small day school. This enabled her to contribute financially, while fulfilling her interest in education. She subsequently worked at the Borough Road School and the Home and Colonial School Society. After her father&#x27;s death, she moved to Ambleside, setting up a school for local children and boarders, Eller How.

On the death of her brother Arthur, she moved to Surrey, to support her sister-in-law Blanche Clough in bringing up their three small children. The youngest daughter, Blanche Athena Clough, would follow in her aunt&#x27;s footsteps and herself become a notable educationalist.

Keenly interested in the education of women, she made friends with Emily Davies, Barbara Bodichon, Frances Buss and others. She gave evidence to a Royal Commission on secondary schooling, based on her own teaching experience. After helping to found the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women, she acted as its secretary from 1867 to 1870 and as its president from 1873 to 1874. Her scheme for peripatetic lecturers was the germ of the University Extension Movement.

==The foundation of Newnham College==

When the ‘Lectures for Ladies’ were set up in Cambridge in the 1870s, it became clear that women who lived at a distance would need accommodation. Henry Sidgwick invited Clough to take charge of the first hostel and its first five students, setting up in Regent Street, Cambridge, in 1871.

The lectures and hostel swiftly became Newnham College, and Clough its first principal. The new college took a different approach to women&#x27;s education from Girton College: where Girton focused on equality, Newnham focused on intellectual flourishing. Girton insisted women take all the same exams as men, where Newnham allowed women to skip the &quot;Little-Go&quot; exam of Latin, Greek and divinity and progress directly to studying their chosen subject. Similarly, while Girton&#x27;s residence was a more surprising design, created by architect Alfred Waterhouse, Newnham Hall was designed to be more tranquil and domestic.

A later biographer described Clough as having &quot;inexhaustible good humour, plenty of common sense and fun, and an enviable ability to admit when she was wrong. These qualities made her students cherish her and enabled her to work well and creatively with her colleagues.&quot; Though she had little experience of administration, she oversaw the building of the new college and negotiations over leasing the land.

Her personality, commitment and drive made her &quot;a recognised leader in the education of women&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

She was cared for at the end of her life by her niece Blanche Athena Clough and her friend Edith Sharpley who was the classics lecturer. They were both present when she died, at Cambridge on 27 February 1892. Two portraits of Clough are at Newnham College, one by Sir William Blake Richmond, the other by James Jebusa Shannon. 

Her grave is in the churchyard of the Church of St Andrew and St Mary, Grantchester, near Cambridge.

Her legacy is marked in Clough Hall and the Clough memorial gates at Newnham College, a stained glass window at Liverpool Cathedral, the Hope Street sculpture &quot;A Case History&quot; in Liverpool. Her birthplace in Liverpool is marked with a plaque, commemorating both Anne Jemima and her brother Arthur Hugh.

Edge Hill University has a hall of residence called Clough in honour of her contribution to higher education and the history of education in Lancashire.

<text>The is the central coordinating law enforcement agency of the Japanese police system. Unlike national police in other countries, the NPA does not have any operational units of its own aside from the Imperial Guard; rather, it is responsible for supervising Japan&#x27;s 47 prefectural police departments and determining their general standards and policies, though it can command police agencies under it in national emergencies or large-scale disasters. It is under the National Public Safety Commission of the Cabinet Office.

As of 2017, the NPA has a strength of approximately 7,800 personnel: 2,100 sworn officers, 900 guards, and 4,800 civilian staff.

==History==
Police services of the Empire of Japan were placed under complete centralized control with the of the Home Ministry at their core. But after the surrender of Japan, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers regarded this centralized police system as undemocratic.

During the occupation, the principle of decentralization was introduced by the 1947 Police Law. Cities and large towns had their own , and the was responsible for smaller towns, villages and rural areas. But most Japanese municipalities were too small to have a large police force, so sometimes they were unable to deal with large-scale violence. In addition, excessive fragmentation of the police organization reduced the efficiency of police activities.

As a response to these problems, complete restructuring created a more centralized system under the 1954 amended Police Law. All operational units except for the Imperial Guard were reorganized into prefectural police for each prefecture, and the National Police Agency was established as the central coordinating agency for these Police Departments.

On April 1, 2022, the NPA created the Cyber Affairs Bureau and the National Cyber Unit. In December 2023, the NPA announced that the TAIT (Telecom Scam Allianced Investigation Team) will be established in April 2024 to unify investigation efforts across Japan on fraud cases.

==Organization==

After the 1996 Japanese embassy hostage crisis in Peru, the Security Bureau established the Terrorism Response Team where officers liaise with foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies when Japanese interests or nationals are in danger. It was later reformed to the Terrorism Response Team - Tactical Wing (TRT-2) for Overseas in order to meet with demands to coordinate with foreign police forces in assisting them whenever a terror attack has happened.

There are six , each responsible for a number of prefectures as below:
: Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Akita, Yamagata, and Fukushima Prefectures
: Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Niigata, Yamanashi, Nagano, and Shizuoka Prefectures

: Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Oita, Miyazaki, Kagoshima, and Okinawa Prefectures

They are located in major cities of each geographic region. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and Hokkaido Prefectural Police Headquarters are excluded from the jurisdiction of regional police bureaus. Headed by a Senior Commissioner, each regional police bureaus exercises necessary control and supervision over and provides support services to prefectural police within its jurisdiction, under the authority and orders of NPA&#x27;s Commissioner General. Attached to each Regional Police Bureaus is a Regional Police School which provides police personnel with education and training required of staff officers as well as other necessary education and training.

====Police Communications Departments====
Metropolitan Tokyo and the island of Hokkaidō are excluded from the regional jurisdictions and are run more autonomously than other local forces, in the case of Tokyo, because of its special urban situation, and of Hokkaidō, because of its distinctive geography. The National Police Agency maintains police communications divisions in these two areas to handle any coordination needed between national and local forces. In other area, Police Communications Departments are established within each Regional Police Bureaus.

<text>Air Vice Marshal Conway Walter Heath Pulford, (26 January 1892 – 10 March 1942) was a senior Royal Air Force officer during World War II. Pulford commanded British forces in the Japanese invasion of Malaya and the subsequent fall of Singapore.

Pulford died of exhaustion and malaria after his evacuation vessel was attacked by Japanese aircraft and ran aground on an uninhabited island.

==Early life==
Pulford was born in Agra, India the son of Russell Richard and Lucy Anne Pulford.

==Naval career==
Pulford began his career in the Royal Navy in 1905 as a Naval Cadet at the Royal Naval College, Osborne. After serving as a midshipman on and , and as a sub-lieutenant on , he became a pilot on the aircraft carrier in December 1914.

==RAF career==
In January 1920, Pulford left the Navy for the Royal Air Force, becoming a squadron commander in 1921. Pulford attended the RAF Staff College in 1922 and the Imperial Defence College in 1929.

===Second World War===
In 1941 he attempted to build up the RAF in the Far East to support all the forces under the Far East Command. But before the Japanese attacked on 8 December 1941, the Far East was given a low priority, so little was done. To bolster his very small staff now that the war had started, Air Vice Marshal Paul Maltby arrived and undertook duties as his deputy. Pulford was authorised to evacuate himself on 5 February 1942. Ten days later Pulford and his naval counterpart, Rear Admiral Ernest Spooner, were amongst the last to leave. Their vessel, the Royal Navy ML 310, was attacked by Japanese aircraft and forced to run aground on a malaria-ridden island called Chibia (Tjibia, Tjebia), part of the Juju group located north of Bangka Island, Indonesia, and was uninhabited. The survivors managed to hold out for two months before being forced to surrender to the Japanese, but the Air Vice Marshal and Rear Admiral had both died of exhaustion and malaria. When Pulford did not arrive in Java, Maltby took over command of RAF Far East Command, but was captured and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war of the Japanese.

<doc id="1034128" wikidata="Q598845" url="?curid=1034128" title="Infidels (Bob Dylan album)">
<text>Infidels is the twenty-second studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on October 27, 1983, by Columbia Records.

Produced by Mark Knopfler and Dylan himself, &quot;Infidels&quot; is seen as his return to secular music, following a conversion to Christianity, three evangelical records and a subsequent return to a less religious lifestyle. Though he has never entirely abandoned religious imagery, &quot;Infidels&quot; gained much attention for its focus on more personal themes of love and loss, in addition to commentary on the environment and geopolitics. Christopher Connelly of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called those gospel albums just prior to &quot;Infidels&quot; &quot;lifeless&quot;, and saw &quot;Infidels&quot; as making Bob Dylan&#x27;s career viable again. According to Connelly, at the time of its release, &quot;Infidels&quot; was considered to be Dylan&#x27;s best poetic and melodic work since &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;.

The critical reaction was the strongest for Dylan in years, almost universally hailed for its songwriting and performances. The album also fared well commercially, reaching in the US and going gold, and in the UK. The album&#x27;s highest chart position worldwide was in Norway, where it peaked at No. 1. Fans and critics were disappointed that several songs were inexplicably cut from the album just prior to mastering—primarily &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;, considered a career highlight by many critics, and not officially released until it appeared on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volume III&quot; eight years later. The album was recorded and mixed entirely on digital recording equipment.

==Recording sessions==
&quot;Infidels&quot; was produced by Mark Knopfler, best known as the frontman of the band Dire Straits, and who had previously played guitar on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot;. Dylan initially wanted to produce the album himself, but feeling that technology had passed him by, he approached a number of contemporary artists who were more at home in a modern recording studio. David Bowie, Frank Zappa and Elvis Costello were all approached before Dylan hired Knopfler.

Knopfler later admitted it was difficult to produce Dylan. &quot;You see people working in different ways, and it&#x27;s good for you. You have to learn to adapt to the way different people work. Yes, it was strange at times with Bob. One of the great parts about production is that it demonstrates to you that you have to be flexible. Each song has its own secret that&#x27;s different from another song, and each has its own life. Sometimes it has to be teased out, whereas other times it might come fast. There are no laws about songwriting or producing. It depends on what you&#x27;re doing, not just who you&#x27;re doing. You have to be sensitive and flexible, and it&#x27;s fun. I&#x27;d say I was more disciplined. But I think Bob is much more disciplined as a writer of lyrics, as a poet. He&#x27;s an absolute genius. As a singer—absolute genius. But musically, I think it’s a lot more basic. The music just tends to be a vehicle for that poetry.&quot;

Once Knopfler was aboard, the two quickly assembled a team of accomplished musicians. Knopfler&#x27;s own guitar playing was paired with that of Mick Taylor, a former lead guitarist of the Rolling Stones. Having been introduced to Taylor the previous summer, Dylan had developed a friendship with him that resulted in the guitarist hearing the &quot;Infidels&quot; material first during the months leading up to the April sessions. In addition, the sessions benefited from Taylor&#x27;s ability as a slide guitarist.

Knopfler said about the instrument he plays on &quot;Infidels&quot;: &quot;I still haven&#x27;t got a flat-top wooden acoustic, because I&#x27;ve never found one that was as good as the two best flat tops I ever played. One … was a hand-built Greco that Rudy Pensa of Rudy&#x27;s Music Stop lent me. I used … the Greco on &quot;Infidels&quot;.&quot;

Knopfler suggested Alan Clark for keyboards as well as engineer Neil Dorfsman, both of whom were hired. According to Knopfler, it was Dylan&#x27;s idea to recruit Robbie Shakespeare and Sly Dunbar as the rhythm section. Best known as Sly &amp; Robbie, Shakespeare and Dunbar were famed reggae producers as well as recording artists signed to Island Records.

&quot;Bob&#x27;s musical ability is limited, in terms of being able to play a guitar or a piano,&quot; said Knopfler. &quot;It&#x27;s rudimentary, but it doesn&#x27;t affect his variety, his sense of melody, his singing. It&#x27;s all there. In fact, some of the things he plays on piano while he&#x27;s singing are lovely, even though they&#x27;re rudimentary. That all demonstrates the fact that you don&#x27;t have to be a great technician. It&#x27;s the same old story: If something is played with soul, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.&quot;

==Songs==
Beginning with &quot;Infidels&quot;, Dylan ceased to preach a specific religion, revealing little about his personal religious beliefs in his lyrics. In 1997, after recovering from a serious heart condition, Dylan said in an interview for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don&#x27;t find it anywhere else … I don&#x27;t adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I&#x27;ve learned more from the songs than I&#x27;ve learned from any of this kind of entity.&quot;

Though &quot;Infidels&quot; is often cited as a return to secular work (following a trio of albums heavily influenced by born-again Christianity), many of the songs recorded during the &quot;Infidels&quot; sessions retain Dylan&#x27;s penchant for biblical references and religious imagery. An example of this is the opening track, &quot;Jokerman&quot;. Along with biblical references, the song&#x27;s lyrics reference populists who are overly concerned with the superficial (&quot;Michelangelo indeed could&#x27;ve carved out your features&quot;) and more about action than thinking through the complexities (&quot;fools rush in where angels fear to tread&quot;). A number of critics have called &quot;Jokerman&quot; a sly political protest, addressed to an antichrist-like figure, a &quot;manipulator of crowds … a dream twister&quot;.

The second track, &quot;Sweetheart Like You&quot;, is sung to a fictitious woman. Oliver Trager&#x27;s book &quot;Keys to the Rain: The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia&quot; mentions that some have criticized this song as sexist. Indeed, music critic Tim Riley makes that accusation in his book &quot;Hard Rain: A Dylan Commentary&quot;, singling out lyrics like &quot;a woman like you should be at home/That&#x27;s where you belong/Taking care of somebody nice/Who don&#x27;t know how to do you wrong.&quot; However, Trager also cites other interpretations that dispute this claim. Some have argued that &quot;Sweetheart Like You&quot; is being sung to the Christian church (&quot;what&#x27;s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?&quot;), claiming that Dylan is mourning the church&#x27;s deviation from scriptural truth. The song was later covered by Rod Stewart on his 1995 album &quot;A Spanner in the Works&quot; and translated and sung by the Italian songwriter Francesco De Gregori in his 2015 album &quot;De Gregori sings Bob Dylan&quot;. Dylan later stated that the line which some criticized &quot;didn&#x27;t come out exactly the way I wanted it to.&quot;
The song &quot;Neighborhood Bully&quot; is a song from the point of view of someone using sarcasm to defend Israel&#x27;s right to exist; the title bemoans Israel&#x27;s and the Jewish people&#x27;s historic treatment in the popular press. Events in the history of the State of Israel are referenced, such as the Six-Day War and Operation Opera, Israel&#x27;s bombing of the Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad on June 7, 1981, or previous bomb making sites bombed by Israeli soldiers. Events in the history of the Israelites as a whole are mentioned, such as being enslaved by Rome, Egypt, and Babylon. Events in modern Jewish secular history are noted as well, such as the Jews&#x27; historic role in the advancement of medicine (&quot;took sickness and disease and turned them into health&quot;). Historic restrictions on Jewish commerce are mentioned as well. In 1983, Dylan visited Israel again, but for the first time allowed himself to be photographed there, including a shot at Jerusalem&#x27;s open-air synagogue wearing a yarmulkah and Jewish phylacteries, and tallith. Some described the song as a declaration of &quot;full-throated Israel support&quot;, a &quot;Zionist anthem&quot; and a &quot;bitter and indignant defense of Israel&#x27;s actions&quot;. However, when interviewed in 1984 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Dylan said that the song was &quot;not a political song&quot; because it did not &quot;fall into a certain political party&quot; while adding that the song might be an expression of heartfelt belief, he didn&#x27;t &quot;know what the politics of Israel&quot; were, said he had &quot;not really&quot; resolved his views on the &quot;Palestinian question&quot; and stated that &quot;the battle of the Armageddon&quot; will be &quot;fought in the Middle East.&quot; In 2001, the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; described the song as &quot;a favorite among Dylan-loving residents of the territories&quot;. Israeli singer Ariel Zilber covered &quot;Neighborhood Bully&quot; in 2005 in a version translated to Hebrew.

A few critics like Robert Christgau and Bill Wyman claimed that &quot;Infidels&quot; betrayed a strong, strange dislike for space travel, and that it can be heard on the first few lines of &quot;License to Kill&quot;. (&quot;Man has invented his doom/First step was touching the moon.&quot;) A harsh indictment accusing mankind of imperialism and a predilection for violence, the song deals specifically with humanity&#x27;s relationship to the environment, either on a political scale or a scientific one, beginning with the first line: &quot;Man thinks because he rules the Earth/He can do with it as he please.&quot; A skeptical opinion toward the American space program was shared among evangelicals of Dylan&#x27;s generation. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, he said he wasn&#x27;t sure why he wrote the line critical of space travel, but believed what he stated in the song.

&quot;Man of Peace&quot; is the fifth track, and deals with the concept that Satan, or evil generally, may disguise himself to mislead humanity. In a 1984 interview, he told the reviewer that &quot;you can&#x27;t be for peace and be global&quot; and compared it to the song.

&quot;Union Sundown&quot; is a political protest song against imported consumer goods and offshoring. In the song, Dylan examines the subject from several different angles, discussing the greed and power of unions and corporations (&quot;You know capitalism is above the law/It don&#x27;t count unless it sells/When it costs too much to build it at home you just build it cheaper someplace else...Democracy don&#x27;t rule this world/You better get that through your head/This world is ruled by violence/Though I guess that&#x27;s better left unsaid&quot;), the hypocrisy of Americans who complain about the lack of American jobs while not paying more for American-made products (&quot;Lots of people complainin&#x27; that there is no work/I say, &#x27;Why you say that for? When nothin&#x27; you got is U.S.-made? They don&#x27;t make nothin&#x27; here no more&quot;), the collaboration of the unions themselves (&quot;The unions are big business, friend/And they&#x27;re goin&#x27; out like a dinosaur&quot;), and the desperate conditions of the foreign workers who make the goods (&quot;All the furniture, it says &quot;Made in Brazil&quot;/Where a woman, she slaved for sure/Bringin&#x27; home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve/You know, that&#x27;s a lot of money to her...And a man&#x27;s going to do what he has to do/When he&#x27;s got a hungry mouth to feed&quot;). In a 1984 interview, Dylan said the song was based on what he had seen, personally, when growing up.

&quot;I and I&quot;, according to author/critic Tim Riley, &quot;updates the Dylan mythos. Even though it substitutes self-pity for the [pessimism found throughout &quot;Infidels&quot;], you can&#x27;t ignore it as a Dylan spyglass: &#x27;Someone else is speakin&#x27; with my mouth, but I&#x27;m listening only to my heart/I&#x27;ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot.&#x27;&quot; Riley sees the song as an exploration of the distance between Dylan&#x27;s &quot;inner identity and the public face he wears&quot;.

&quot;Infidels&quot;&#x27; closer, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall Apart on Me Tonight&quot;, stands out on the album as a pure love song. On past albums like &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; and &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, Dylan closed with love songs sung to the narrator&#x27;s partner, and that tradition is continued with &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall Apart On Me Tonight&quot;, with a chorus that asks &quot;Don&#x27;t fall apart on me tonight/I just don&#x27;t think that I could handle it/Don&#x27;t fall apart on me tonight/Yesterday&#x27;s just a memory/Tomorrow is never what it&#x27;s supposed to be/And I need you, yeah, you tonight.&quot;

==Final sequencing and mixing==
While Dylan was known to be prolific and had numerous outtakes for most of his albums, &quot;Infidels&quot; in particular garnered considerable controversy over the years regarding its final selection of songs. By June 1983, Dylan and Knopfler had set a preliminary sequence of nine songs, including two songs that were ultimately omitted: &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; and &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;. Other notable outtakes like &quot;Someone&#x27;s Got a Hold of My Heart&quot; (later re-written and re-recorded for &quot;Empire Burlesque&quot; as &quot;Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)&quot;) were recorded during these sessions, but only &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; and &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; received serious consideration for possible inclusion.

&quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; is perhaps the most heatedly discussed outtake in Dylan&#x27;s catalog. &quot;On the surface, &#x27;Blind Willie McTell&#x27; is about the landscape of the blues,&quot; writes Tim Riley, &quot;and the figures Dylan pays respects to on his 1962 debut. But it&#x27;s also about the landscape of pop, and how an aging persona like Dylan might feel as he casts his experienced gaze over the road he&#x27;s walked. Always skeptical about the quality of his own voice, he didn&#x27;t release &#x27;Blind Willie McTell&#x27; at first because he didn&#x27;t feel his tribute lived up to its sources. The irony here is that his own insecurity about living up to his imagined blues ideal becomes a subject in itself. &#x27;Nobody sings the blues like Blind Willie McTell&#x27; becomes a way of saying how Dylan feels displaced not just by the industry … but by the music he calls home.&quot; Clinton Heylin gives &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; a more ambitious interpretation, describing it as &quot;the world&#x27;s eulogy, sung by an old bluesman recast as St. John the Divine&quot;.

Both &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; and &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; were dropped from consideration soon after Mark Knopfler ended his involvement with the album. In later years, Knopfler claimed that &quot;&quot;Infidels&quot; would have been a better record if I had mixed the thing, but I had to go on tour in Germany, and then Bob had a weird thing with CBS, where he had to deliver records to them at a certain time and I was away in Europe … Some of [&quot;Infidels&quot;] is like listening to roughs. Maybe Bob thought I&#x27;d rushed things because I was in a hurry to leave, but I offered to finish it after our tour. Instead, he got the engineer to do the final mix.&quot;

Dylan spent roughly a month on remixing and overdubbing, holding a number of sessions in June re-recording vocal tracks using newly rewritten lyrics. During this time, he decided to cast aside &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; and &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;, replacing them with &quot;Union Sundown&quot;.

==Reception==

While &quot;Infidels&quot; was better received than its predecessor, &quot;Shot of Love&quot;, Graham Lock of &quot;New Musical Express&quot; still referred to Dylan as &quot;culturally a spent force … a confused man trying to rekindle old fires.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was not impressed either, writing that Dylan had &quot;turned into a hateful crackpot&quot;. Greil Marcus dismissed it many years later as another &quot;bad [album] that made no sense, didn&#x27;t hang together, had no point, and did not need to exist&quot;.

But even some of the skeptics found some merit in &quot;Infidels&quot;. In the same review, Christgau wrote, &quot;All the wonted care Dylan has put into this album shows.&quot; Indeed, critics were unanimous in praising the overall sound, &quot;one case where the streamlined production doesn&#x27;t seem to work against the rugged authority he can still command as a singer,&quot; wrote Tim Riley. Music critic Bill Wyman conceded that &quot;the songs are mature and complex&quot; even though &quot;melodically they are similar sounding and the affair as a whole still has echoes of his crackpot Christian days.&quot;

&quot;Infidels&quot; would place tenth on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1983, Dylan&#x27;s highest placement since 1975 when &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; placed #1 and &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; placed #4. Years later, when outtakes like &quot;Someone&#x27;s Got a Hold of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; and &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; began to circulate, the album&#x27;s stature would in some ways grow, becoming a missed opportunity at a potential masterpiece to some critics like Rob Bowman and Clinton Heylin.

Without a tour in 1983, &quot;Infidels&quot; still generated modest sales, selling consistently through the Christmas shopping season. CBS even produced a music video for &quot;Sweetheart Like You&quot;, Dylan&#x27;s first in the MTV era. Steve Ripley from Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Shot of Love&quot; band was one of the guitarists in the video. The female guitar player featured who mimed Mick Taylor&#x27;s guitar solo is Carla Olson. This appearance led to her recording a live album with Taylor as well as numerous studio sessions with him. And Dylan gave her the unreleased song &quot;Clean Cut Kid&quot; for her debut album &quot;Midnight Mission&quot; (A&amp;M Records). &quot;Sweetheart Like You&quot; was followed by a second video for &quot;Jokerman&quot;, which CBS issued as a single in February 1984.

==Aftermath and legacy==
Dylan spent the fall of 1983 recording demos and various songs at his home in Malibu, California. Rather than work alone, Dylan brought in a number of young musicians, including Charlie Sexton, drummer Charlie Quintana and guitarist JJ Holiday. As Heylin notes, &quot;this was Dylan&#x27;s first real dalliance with third-generation American rock &amp; rollers.&quot; These informal sessions set the stage for Dylan&#x27;s first public performances since 1982.

Dylan appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; on March 22, 1984. He performed with Quintana, Holiday (introduced by Letterman as &quot;Justin Jesting&quot;), and bassist Tony Marsico. Performing three songs with his band of post-punk musicians, the Plugz, Dylan delivered what many consider to be his most entertaining television performance ever. The combo first performed an unrehearsed version of Sonny Boy Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Me to Talking&quot;, then a radically different arrangement of &quot;License To Kill&quot;. The final song was a peppy, somewhat new-wave version of &quot;Jokerman&quot; that ended with a harmonica solo. At the end of the performance, Letterman walked onstage and congratulated Dylan, asking him if he could come back and play every Thursday. Dylan smiled and jokingly agreed.

<text>The Cromford Canal ran from Cromford to the Erewash Canal in Derbyshire, England with a branch to Pinxton. Built by William Jessop with the assistance of Benjamin Outram, its alignment included four tunnels and 14 locks.

From Cromford it ran south following the contour line along the east side of the valley of the Derwent to Ambergate, where it turned eastwards along the Amber valley. It turned sharply to cross the valley, crossing the river and the Ambergate to Nottingham road, by means of an aqueduct at Bullbridge, before turning towards Ripley. From there the Butterley Tunnel took it through to the Erewash Valley.

From the tunnel it continued to Ironville, the junction for the branch to Pinxton, and then descended through fourteen locks to meet the Erewash Canal at Langley Mill. The Pinxton Branch became important as a route for Nottinghamshire coal, via the Erewash, to the River Trent and Leicester and was a terminus of the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway.

A long section of the Cromford canal between Cromford and Ambergate is listed as a Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a local nature reserve.

In addition to purely canal traffic, there was a lively freight interchange with the Cromford and High Peak Railway, which traversed the plateau of the Peak District from Whaley Bridge in the north west, and which descended to the canal at High Peak Junction by means of an inclined plane.

==Origins==
The Erewash Canal had been opened from the River Trent to Langley Mill in 1779, but initially there was a lack of traffic. The proprietors appealed for anyone who owned land near the canal which contained coal deposits to open pits. As the pits opened, profits soared, and by 1789 dividends had reached 20 per cent. On 1 May 1787, the proprietors considered two letters at their meeting, which proposed extensions beyond Langley Mill. The proposals were from local landowners, and were seen as an extension of the Erewash Canal. One was for a canal from Langley Mill to Pinxton, where there were of coal-bearing land, but the promotors could not reach agreement with the proprietors of the Erewash Canal.

The suggestion was declined by the canal company, so local businessmen, including Benjamin Outram&#x27;s father Joseph, Benjamin decided to go ahead on their own, asking William Jessop to design one between Langley Mill and Cromford, with a branch to Pinxton. This would carry coal to Cromford, which was becoming industrialised, and limestone from the area for the growing iron industry. Also important would be lead from Wirksworth and cotton from the Cromford mills. The connection to the Erewash Canal would provide an outlet to the Trent and Mersey Canal and the rest of the country.

The canal therefore attracted the support of some powerful figures such as Philip Gell of Hopton Hall and Sir Richard Arkwright – the latter initially at least. Matters were taken out of the Erewash Canal owners hands, for, without their co-operation, there was the implicit threat that a competing canal would be built to the Trent. The major opposition came from the water-powered mill owners along the Derwent, of which there were many, downstream of the proposed canal, fearful of loss of flow in dry weather. Since, between Cromford and Pinxton, the canal would be level, Jessop was able to give reassurance, carefully downplaying the problem of the descent, with its locks, to Langley Mill.

However, with the assistance of Benjamin Outram, he also spent over a year measuring the flow rate of the Derwent, a precaution which was invaluable when the bill was placed before Parliament. He also proposed to make the summit pound deep enough that it could be replenished on Sundays when the mills were closed, and hold enough water to supply the locks for a week even in the driest weather.

The length from the Erewash Canal would be built to match, accessible to barges from the Trent. Through the Butterley Tunnel and along the narrow Derwent valley it would be to narrow boat standards, similar to the Trent and Mersey.

At the last minute before the bill was to be presented to Parliament, Richard Arkwright raised a problem. The assumption had been that water would come from Cromford Sough, the drainage from the Wirksworth lead mines. Arkwright complained that the canal crossed his land and insisted that water should be obtained from the river by raising the height of the weir at Masson Mill. This was an unwelcome complication (which would mainly benefit Arkwright himself and his mill) but the canal committee reluctantly agreed.

==Construction==

The canal obtained its act of Parliament, the (29 Geo. 3. c. 74). Perhaps because they had quoted too little, basing their estimates on Jessop&#x27;s cost predictions which may themselves have been too optimistic, the contractors soon found themselves in financial difficulties and, at the end of 1790, simply walked off the site. Benjamin Outram hastily took over full management control and was awarded a salary increase. In January 1792 there was a problem when the Amber Aqueduct failed but, by May, the canal to the east of Butterley was virtually complete and most of the earthworks to the west.
The Butterley Tunnel was excavated by first sinking 33 shafts, about apart as much as deep to give a number of working faces. Most of the heading was through soil, with some coal measures and iron ore deposits, the final tunnel being lined through most of its length.

By 1793 the company had a balance in hand of only £273 and the cost had risen to half as much again as Jessop&#x27;s original estimate. Nevertheless, the canal was showing an income, unfinished though it was.

In August, however, there were problems with the Derwent Aqueduct which required considerable modification. The spandrel walls had parted due to the horizontal forces imposed by the canal, and a longitudinal split had opened up in the arch. In his report to the canal committee, Jessop gave his opinion that the use of Crich lime, being unusually pure, had delayed the setting of the mortar. Later writers, with the benefit of engineering knowledge acquired after Jessop&#x27;s time, have suggested that the spandrel walls were simply too slender for the forces imposed. At any rate, the arch was partly dismantled and steel tie bars and lateral reinforcing arches were installed, together with external buttresses. This Jessop did at his own expense.

In the end, despite costing about twice the initial estimate of £42,697 (£ in ), the canal opened in 1794 and was a financial success.


==Operation==
Jessop had based his initial predictions for the expected returns on the carriage of limestone from Cromford and Crich and coal from Pinxton. However, the canal itself encouraged new enterprises.

The canal mostly carried coal, lead and iron ore, some extracted from inside the Butterley Tunnel. Copper was brought from as far away as Ecton Hill in Staffordshire and the canal opening the way for lead from Ecton, as well as Wirksworth to be taken to the Lead Market at Hull and chert from Bakewell to the Potteries. It also allowed the finished products of the area to be exported widely, the Butterley Company&#x27;s castings and Arkwright&#x27;s spun cotton. The opening of the Derby Canal and the Nottingham Canal, both in 1796, further facilitated the latter&#x27;s trade with these textile centres.

Although Arkwright had suggested that water should be drawn from the Derwent (by raising his weir at Masson Mill and feeding it via an aqueduct to Cromford Meadows – thus improving his plans for quarries behind Willersley and adding extra power to his mill wheels at the expense of the canal company), the canal committee had secretly no intention of so doing. The proprietors changed the line of the canal to its present terminus, where a connection was made to the Cromford sough, even though they had to purchase the land from Arkwright at £1,000 and landscape (at unknown cost) the grounds of his then house. Water could be drawn from the sough at night as well as on Sundays, when Cromford Mill was not working. Coming from underground, it was slightly warm, and it was said that it never froze. (Arkwright had been using the sough water to power Cromford Mill since the previous century.) The opening of the Nottingham Canal provided further water via the Butterley Reservoir, almost above Butterley Tunnel and on the summit level of the Cromford Canal.
The sign illustrated (left) was displayed at both ends of the Butterley tunnel, and stressed the importance of only using the narrow tunnel in any one direction at particular times. There are reported instances of fines levied for non-compliance with these rules.

In 1819 the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway opened up trade with Mansfield including moulding sand for the foundries.

In 1831, the Cromford and High Peak Railway opened a route up to Manchester
The canal also carried limestone from the Butterley Company&#x27;s quarry at Crich with a plateway to the Amber Wharf at Bullbridge. In an attempt to avoid using cable-haulage or a rack and pinion system, a remarkable steam engine, the &quot;Steam Horse&quot; was tried out in 1813.

In 1840 when the North Midland Railway was built, George Stephenson was faced with the problem at Bullbridge of taking the line over the road but under the canal, thus the Bullbridge Aqueduct, in its final form, placed the river, road, railway and canal at four levels. 

In 1846 the mining beneath Wirksworth had reached such a depth that Meerbrook Sough was built, draining into the Derwent near Whatstandwell, which deprived both Arkwrights mill and the canal of water, leaving the latter with only that from Butterley Reservoir. Accordingly, the canal owners first hired a pump and then built the Leawood Pump House in 1849 buying a Cornish-type beam engine from Grahams of Elsecar.
==Decline==
In 1802 the canal had carried over 150,000 tons and by 1842 nearly 300,000, then in 1849, the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway was built alongside as far as Ambergate, which reached Manchester in 1867. A further line to Pye Bridge was built in 1875. By 1888 trade had shrunk to 45,000 tons a year.

The (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ccxc) authorised a merger with the MBM&amp;MJR. The sale was not carried through until 1852 by which time the Midland Railway and the LNWR had assumed joint control and, with railway lines from Rowsley through Ambergate to the north and south, it was being used for little more than local traffic.

In 1889, subsidence closed the Butterley Tunnel for four years, and further subsidence in 1900 resulted in the tunnel being permanently closed. Most of the canal was abandoned in 1944 with the exception of a half-mile (800m) stretch to Langley Mill which was abandoned in 1962. The Bullbridge Aqueduct was removed in 1968 when the Ripley road was widened. In 1985 the Codnor Park Reservoir was lowered by and a lock was removed as part of a flood prevention scheme.

==Restoration==
Before the canal was abandoned because it no longer server a commercial purpose, there were official moves to consider its future. As part of the parliamentary discussion for the Transport Bill in November 1952, the British Transport Commission talked to various county and local authorities to see whether they would be interested in acquiring canals, and the Cromford was one of those. At the time, the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) had the canal earmarked as one that could be restored. The Inland Waterways Preservation Society proposed in 1959 that the upper reaches of the canal, including the Leawood pumping station, should be retained. In 1961, Ripley Urban District Council withdrew an earlier proposal to close the canal, and supported Derbyshire County Council in their proposal that the canal should be maintained for its amenity value. By 1971, Derbyshire County Council were actively considering including the upper reaches of the canal in a High Peak Park development scheme. The transfer of ownership of the top of canal between Cromford and Ambergate from the British Waterways Board to Derbyshire County Council was reported in October 1972 in a new magazine called &quot;Waterways World&quot;, launched to highlight the growing interest in canal restoration schemes. The Cromford Canal Society (CCS) was formed at the same time, to manage the restoration. The Society was registered with the Charity Commission on 3 October 1972. By the time the IWA held their National Rally in 1974, they announced growing interest in a plan to restore the lower reached of the Cromford Canal as well.

Volunteers began working on the Cromford end of the canal from around 1968, well before the transfer of ownership to Derbyshire County Council. Their first priority was to improve the towpath, which they did with large quantities of limestone and the use of borrowed dumper trucks. They also attempted to create a drainage channel, so that water could pass down the canal rather than becoming a flood hazard in times of heavy rain. As confidence grew, they repaired leaks in the banks, and borrowed two Smalley excavators for the Waterway Recovery Group to begin dredging the channel, but they were too small for the job. When ownership transferred to Derbyshire County Council, they obtained a second-hand nine-ton Smith 14 tracked excavator which was much more suitable. Much of the clearance work was achieved by driving the machine along the canal bed, and by 1977 they were able to drive it out of the canal at Leawood, ready for re-watering the canal.

By mid-1977, the canal was in water, and a horse-drawn trip boat was operating on some weekends. This proved to be popular, and regular weekend trips were operated in 1978, with around 8,000 visitors enjoying the experience. The trip boat, named the &quot;John Gray&quot;, was lengthend from to in January 1979 and to In 1982, Some 15,000 passengers were carried in 1982. As the scope of the project grew, the society transformed itself into a limited company on 4 January 1979, and employed a full-time worker later that month. The Manpower Services Commission had launched the Job Creation Scheme in October 1975, and the Cromford Canal became one of 20 canals to benefit from this, when in February 1979 they organised a team of workers to carry out maintenance and restoration. This continued for a decade, with the last group assisting the canal in 1988. Other groups which provided volunteer labour included engineering apprentices, Girl Guides, trainee nurses, Matlock Fire Brigade, Alfreton young offenders, Scouts, Foreign Exchange students and Army personnel.

The Leawood steam pumping station was restored to working order. Volunteers began visiting it in 1971, by agreement with the British Waterways Board, to assess what was required, and to understand its operation. Once Derbyshire County Council owned the canal, they applied for a grant of £5,613 from the Department of the Environment to refurbish the Grade II* listed building. After eight years, the engine was ready to steam again, and once the teething problems were resolved, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire formally opened the pumping station on 3 May 1980. Later that day they also formally opened the canal, by cutting a ribbon tied across Cromford wharf.
Work continued to restore the canal beyond Leawood to Leashaw, passing through Gregory tunnel. Much of the clearance work was carried out using a Smalley excavator mounted on a pontoon. It got as far a Leashaw bridge, before it was needed further back along the canal. On 21 December 1988, the last day of working for the year&#x27;s Job Creation Team, they made a trip on the &quot;John Gray&quot; from Cromford to Gregory Dam, beyond the tunnel, and back to Cromford. This was the only passenger boat to use this section of the canal, as heavy rainfall and high winds in February 1989 resulted in three spillways becoming blocked, and the canal over-topping its banks in two places, the first of which was at the same place that a breach had occurred in 1920. The canal beyond Leawood was drained, and was never used by trip boats. The Cromford Canal Society was wound up in 1990, and the canal gradually became derelict again.

===Another attempt===
After 12 years of neglect, a new organisation was formed to carry on restoration work. The Friends of the Cromford Canal was formed in March 2002, with the stated aim of restoring the whole canal for navigation.
Most of the top of canal owned by Derbyshire County Council remains in water. In March 2013 dredging began on a length between Leawood Pumphouse and Cromford Wharf with the aim of making it navigable for narrowboats. Derbyshire CC funded this work, which was carried out by Ebsfleet Environmental using suction dredgers. The Friends of the Cromford Canal obtained a trip boat, originally built as a butty in 1938, but which had been used for trips on the Caldon Canal at Froghall until 2010. It arrived at Langley Mill in 2013, where the engine, fitted in 1995, was replaced by an electric drive, and then moved to Cromford by road. The historic cargo narrowboat, named &quot;Birchwood&quot;, has given visitors the opportunity to experience both horse-drawn and electric-powered trips along the dredged section since 2013.

Since 2001, most of the Ambergate to Cromford section of the canal has been within the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site, with the final at Ambergate located within the Heritage Site buffer zone. The Derbyshire Wildlife Trust manage manage the section from Whatstandwell to Ambergate as it is a designated nature reserve. The whole canal has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1981. The towpath from Ambergate to Cromford is a popular walking route, providing views of the adjacent Derwent Valley Line and access to Leawood Pump House and the High Peak Junction of the Cromford and High Peak Railway.
In late 2020, the Friends of the Cromford Canal were granted planning permission for a extension of the canal from Langley Mill towards Cromford, to be known as the Beggarlee Extension. The planning process took four years, as both Amber Valley and Broxtowe councils required onerous conditions to be met. The original route in this area was severed by the construction of the A610 road, which followed the course of the canal for a short distance. The extension will therefore be a new canal, with Beggarlee locks, a staircase pair, lifting the level of the canal sufficiently for it to pass under a bridge constructed for a former colliery railway. It will then skirt around the spoil heaps of Moorgreen Colliery, to rejoin the original route at Stoney Lane, Brinsley. 

Construction began in mid-2023 on some enabling works, which were a pre-requisite to building the actual canal. These involved culverting two watercourses that crossed the work site, and the creation of a flood compensation area, since the canal will run across the Erewash flood plain, reducing its capacity. Spoil removed from the compensation area will be used to build up the banks of the new canal channel. Concern about whether the bridge foundations are strong enough to support the weight of a canal means that the canal will be carried beneath the road in a concrete aqueduct, supported on foundations which are beyond those that were constructed for the bridge.

==Friends of the Cromford Canal==
The Friends of the Cromford Canal is a charitable organisation whose aim is to see the restoration of the Cromford Canal for the benefit of the general public. The society promotes the restoration of the Canal to navigation, and to connect it to the national inland waterway system at the junction with the Erewash Canal at Langley Mill. The group runs a trip boat, &quot;Birdswood&quot;, between Cromford Wharf and Leawood Pump House, although even after dredging of the section in 2013 it is quite shallow. English actor Brian Blessed is the president of Friends of the Cromford Canal. His voice gives the recorded safety announcement for the tripboat.

<text>China National Highway 312 (312国道), also referred to as Route 312, is a key east-west route beginning in Shanghai and ending at Khorgas, Xinjiang in the Ili River valley, on the border with Kazakhstan. In total it spans , passing through Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu before ending in Xinjiang. Besides Shanghai, cities of note on the route include Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Hefei, Xinyang, Nanyang, Xi&#x27;an, Lanzhou, Jiayuguan and Ürümqi.

The road was the subject of Rob Gifford&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;China Road&quot;, in which he describes traveling the entire length of Route 312 from the East China Sea to Central Asia.

The G40 Shanghai–Xi&#x27;an Expressway has replaced National Highway 312 as the main route between those two cities.

==Route and distance==


== Accidents ==
On October 10 2019, a bridge of G312 crossing Xigang Road in Wuxi was collapsed by several overloaded trucks, killing 3 people and injuring 2 others.

<doc id="1034138" wikidata="Q784868" url="?curid=1034138" title="Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel">
<text>Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel (; 1 September 1727 – 13 April 1794) was a French Catholic cleric and politician of the Revolution. He was executed during the Reign of Terror.

==Biography==
Gobel was born in the town of Thann in Alsace to a lawyer to the Sovereign Council of Alsace and tax collector for the Seigneury of Thann. After outstanding success in his early schooling in Porrentruy, he studied at the Jesuit college in Colmar, then theology in the German College in Rome, from which he graduated in 1743.

===Clerical career===
Gobel was ordained a Catholic priest in 1750 and then became a member of the cathedral chapter of the Prince-Bishop of Basel, Simon Nikolaus Euseb von Montjoye-Hirsingen, based in Porrentruy, In 1771 he was appointed the auxiliary bishop of the diocese for the section that was situated in French territory, being named by the Holy See as a titular bishop &quot;in partibus&quot; of Lydda. He consecrated the next Prince-Bishop, Friedrich Ludwig Franz von Wangen zu Geroldseck, on 3 March 1776. Found to have been living beyond his means, he was relieved of his duties by Wangen zu Geroldseck&#x27;s successor, Franz Joseph Sigismund von Roggenbach, in 1782. After this he began to espouse &quot;reformist&quot; ideas. His political life began when he was elected deputy to the Estates-General of 1789 by the clergy of the Bailiwick of Huningue.

The turning-point of his life was Gobel&#x27;s action in taking the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (3 January 1791), in favour of which he had declared himself since 5 May 1790. The document gave the appointment of priests to the electoral assemblies, and, after taking the oath, Gobel had become so popular that he was elected constitutional bishop in several dioceses. He chose the Archbishopric of Paris, and in spite of the difficulties which he had to encounter before he could enter into possession, he took up office on 17 March 1791 and was consecrated on 27 March by eight bishops, including Charles Maurice de Talleyrand. This action was rejected by the Holy See, which has never recognized him as a legitimate holder of the office, and continues to hold the canonical archbishop, Antoine-Eléonore-Léon Le Clerc de Juigné, as the legitimate Archbishop of Paris during that period.

===Politics===
On 8 November 1792, Gobel was appointed administrator of Paris. His public display of anti-clericalism was most likely a careful tactic to ensure the sympathy of politicians: among other things, he declared himself opposed to clerical celibacy. On the 17th Brumaire in the year II (7 November 1793), he came before the bar of the National Convention for his activities as civil commissioner in Porrentruy, and, in a famous scene, resigned his episcopal functions, proclaiming that he did so for love of the people, and through respect for their wishes. The previous night, a delegation from the Commune led by Hébert, Chaumette and Cloots had demanded that he publicly renounce his faith or be put to death by the people.

The followers of Jacques Hébert, who were then pursuing their anti-Christian policy, claimed Gobel as their representative. At the same time, Hébert&#x27;s rival Maximilien Robespierre viewed Gobel as an atheist – although he was not accused of apostasy, and never publicly professed atheism.

Robespierre&#x27;s vision of a deist Cult of the Supreme Being was threatened by the opposition of atheist Hébertists (&quot;see Cult of Reason&quot;), and Gobel shared the fate of the latter. Imprisoned, he was found guilty of the so-called &#x27;Luxembourg prison plot&#x27; together with Chaumette; Lucile Desmoulins, wife of the recently executed Camille Desmoulins; Françoise Hebert, wife of the recently executed Hébert; and an assortment of other prisoners of various types. Gobel, on being thrown into prison, suffered the agonies of acute remorse. He hastened to do all in his power to repair his misconduct; he sent his written confession to the Abbé Lothringer, and signed the document, not as bishop of Paris, but of Lydda. He entreated the Abbé to give him the benefit of his ministrations in his last moments, to come to the Conciergerie at the time when he was leaving it for the guillotine, and to pronounce over him the form of absolution, not forgetting the clause &quot;ab omni vinculo excommunicationis&quot;. Gobel&#x27;s penitence was likewise attested by the Abbé Emery and the Abbé Gaston de Sambucy.

All of the alleged conspirators were sentenced to death on the morning of 13 April and guillotined that same afternoon.

<text>Philip Bourke Marston (13 August 1850 – 13 February 1887) was an English poet.

==Life==

He was born in London 13 August 1850, the son of John Westland Marston.
Philip James Bailey and Dinah Maria Mulock were his sponsors, and the most popular of the latter&#x27;s short poems, &quot;Philip, my King,&quot; is addressed to him. 
At age three, Marston partially lost his vision due to the injudicious administration of belladonna (as a prophylactic against scarlet fever), potentially aggravated by an accidental blow. 
For many years he maintained enough vision to see, in his own words, &quot;the tree-boughs waving in the wind, the pageant of sunset in the west, and the glimmer of a fire upon the hearth;&quot; and this dim, imperfect perception may have been more stimulating to his imagination than either perfect sight or total blindness.

He indulged, like Hartley Coleridge, in a consecutive series of imaginary adventures and in the reveries called up by music.

His skills in verbal expression and melody were soon manifested in poems of remarkable merit for his years, and displaying a power of delineating the aspects of nature which, his affliction considered, seemed almost incomprehensible. 
These efforts met full recognition from the brilliant literary circle then gathered around his father. Marston was intensely happy for a time in the affection of Mary Nesbit. 
The death of his betrothed from rapid consumption, in November 1871, devastated him, and was the precursor of a series of calamities which may have produced the morbid element in his views of life and nature.

In 1874, a friend, Oliver Madox Brown, died suddenly. In 1878 Marston lost with equal suddenness his beloved sister Cicely, to whom one of his most beautiful poems is addressed. 
His surviving sister, Eleanor, died early in the following year; her husband, Arthur O&#x27;Shaughnessy, followed shortly. 
In 1882, the death of Marston&#x27;s chief poetic ally and inspirer, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, was followed closely by that of another kindred spirit, James Thomson, who was carried dying from his blind friend&#x27;s rooms, where he had sought refuge from his latest miseries early in June of the same year.

Marston&#x27;s poetry became sorrowful and melancholy. The idylls of flower-life, such as the early &quot;The Rose and the Wind&quot;, were succeeded by dreams of sleep and the repose of death. These qualities and gradations of feeling are traceable through his three published collections, &quot;Songtide&quot; (1871), &quot;All in All&quot; (1873) and &quot;Wind Voices&quot; (1883). Marston&#x27;s poetry was collected in 1892 by Louise Chandler Moulton, a loyal friend, and herself a poet.

In his later years Marston wrote short stories for &quot;Home Chimes&quot;, as well as American magazines, through the agency of Mrs. Chandler Moulton. His popularity in America far exceeded that in his own country.

The three volumes of poetry published in his lifetime, &quot;Song-Tide and other Poems&quot; (1871), &quot;All in All&quot; (1875), and &quot;Wind Voices&quot; (1883), abound with beautiful thoughts expressed in beautiful language. 
His short stories were collected by Mr. Sharp under the title of &quot;For a Song&#x27;s Sake and other Stories&quot; (1887, 8vo).

He died on the 13th February 1887 and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. The inscription on the headstone above his grave (plot no.27388) has now entirely worn away.

<text>Sir Richard Tetley Glazebrook (18 September 1854 – 15 December 1935) was an English physicist.

==Education and early career==
Glazebrook was born in West Derby, Liverpool, Lancashire, the son of a surgeon. He was educated at Dulwich College until 1870, Liverpool College from 1870 to 1872, and Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he graduated in Mathematics in 1876 and of which he was elected a fellow in 1877. He studied physics under James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Rayleigh at the new Cavendish Laboratory and, in 1880, was appointed a demonstrator at the laboratory.

The following year (1881), he was also appointed a college lecturer in mathematics and physics and a university lecturer in mathematics. His research focused on electrical standards and aviation. When defining electrical standards for the unit of resistance, the British Science Association were trying to determine what length a mercury column should be, to express the absolute value of the Ohm. A number of different values had been obtained over the years and Glazebrook determined the value at 106.3 cm. 

Despite skepticism of mercurial standards this was the International value agreed on later by the 1893 Chicago conference.

==Later career==
He hoped to succeed Rayleigh as Cavendish Professor of Physics in 1884, but was surprisingly (given that he was also Rayleigh&#x27;s choice) passed over in favour of Sir J.J. Thomson, which was a great disappointment to him. He was, however, appointed Assistant Director of the Cavendish in 1891 and Bursar of Trinity College in 1895. In 1898, he was appointed Principal of University College, Liverpool.

In June 1899, however, he left to become first Director of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Teddington. During the First World War, he chaired the government&#x27;s Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, located at the NPL, under the presidency of John Strutt, Lord Rayleigh.

He held his post at the NPL until his retirement (largely due to friction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research) in 1919, successfully establishing the NPL as a world leader in physics research.

==Retirement==
Following his retirement, he moved back to Cambridge and edited the &quot;Dictionary of Applied Physics&quot;. From 1920 to 1923 he was Zaharoff Professor of Aviation and Director of the Department of Aeronautics at Imperial College, London. He remained on the General Board of the NPL and chaired the Executive Committee from 1925 to 1932.

==Honours and awards==
In 1882, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) at the very young age of 28. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895. He served as Vice-President of the Royal Society in 1919–1920 and 1924–1928, and as its Foreign Secretary from 1926 to 1929. He was awarded the Hughes Medal in 1909 and the Royal Medal in 1931.

He was also awarded the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1918, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1933. 

He was President of the Physical Society, later the Institute of Physics, from 1903 to 1905, and president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1906.

Glazebrook was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1910, was knighted in 1917, and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1920 New Year War Honours and Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1934.

==Personal life==
He married Frances Gertrude Atkinson of Leeds in 1883; they had a son and three daughters. He died at Limpsfield, Surrey, on 15 December 1935, aged 81.

<doc id="1034151" wikidata="Q475718" url="?curid=1034151" title="The Bottom">
<text>The Bottom (formerly Botte) is the capital and largest town of the island of Saba, the Caribbean Netherlands. It is the first stop on the way from Saba&#x27;s Port in Fort Bay towards the rest of the island. In 2001, it had 462 inhabitants of the total 1,349 islanders. It is the administrative center of Saba.

==History==
The first European settlements occurred around 1640, by colonists from Zeeland. After a landslide destroyed their original settlement, these settlers established a village in The Bottom. The original name of the village was &quot;De Botte&quot;, old Dutch for &quot;The Bowl&quot;, referring to its geographical position in a valley surrounded by the various mountains. &quot;The Bottom&quot; is an English corruption of this name. After the Dutch settlers, Irish, English, and Scottish settlers followed, along with enslaved Africans, and the main language of the island&#x27;s villages became English.

By the 1860s, The Bottom was one of 7 main districts, with St. John&#x27;s, Windwardside, Booby Hill, Mary&#x27;s Point (Palmetto Point), Hell&#x27;s Gate, and Middle Island. The Bottom district had its own elected head, as did the other districts. In 1865, the population of The Bottom was 616 inhabitants. In 1877, construction of Sacred Heart Catholic Church began in The Bottom; the church is still operational today, although the building was replaced in 1909 and again in 1934.

Throughout the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, most men in The Bottom engaged in farming or fishing. They also engaged in shipbuilding, which was one of Saba&#x27;s industries in the 19th century. Most women engaged in domestic work in the home, as well as hatmaking and local drawn thread work known as Saba Lace.

By 1900, The Bottom was one of four main villages on Saba, along with St. John&#x27;s, Windwardside, and Hell&#x27;s Gate. In 1909, a navigation school opened in The Bottom; it operated until 1922. In 1919, construction began on the Weselyan Holiness Church in The Bottom; the church is still operational today. In 1923, Queen Wilhemina Library opened in The Bottom; the library is still operational today. Saba&#x27;s first movie theater opened in 1953, and its second in 1964.

In the early-to-mid-20th century, there was extensive emigration from Saba, and The Bottom&#x27;s population was cut almost in half. By 1972, the population of The Bottom had decreased to 341 inhabitants. 

In the mid-to-late-20th century, there was economic development on Saba, and especially in The Bottom and Windwardside. The first supermarket opened in The Bottom in 1964. In 1992, the Saba University School of Medicine opened in The Bottom. In 2001, the population of Windwardside was 462 inhabitants.

==Infrastructure==
The Bottom is home to the government offices, a hospital, a nursing home, Juliana Sports Field, three churches, a library, the Queen&#x27;s Hotel resort, and various shops, restaurants, and bars. The Bottom is also the location of the Saba University School of Medicine.

The city also has the largest Cruyff Court in the world, Cruyff Court Saba.

==Events==
As capital of the island, The Bottom hosts a number of events throughout the year. 

During the summer, the island&#x27;s Carnival celebration (called Saba Carnival or Saba Summer Festival) takes place. Usually in late July, Saba Carnival is a weeklong festival that includes live music, food, dancing, games, and parades. Carnival Village, where the majority of the events take place, is located in The Bottom. Each night during the week, there is live music at Carnival Village. The jourvert parade (very early Saturday morning) begins in Windwardside and ends in The Bottom. The Grand Parade and the Second Parade take place in The Bottom on Saturday and Sunday. Locals and tourists congregate in The Bottom for the parades, which include energetic music, colorful floats, and troupes wearing colorful costumes.

Another event held in The Bottom is Saba Day. This is the celebratory national day of the island, when all offices, schools and businesses are closed. The islanders honour their diversity and culture through various activities, performances and parades. The Bottom hosts a concert at the sports field, where local (and neighbouring) Caribbean artists come to perform. There are fishing competitions at sea, drawing competitions for children, dance performances, cookouts, and more.

== Hiking ==
The Bottom is the location of many trailheads.

* The Ladder consists of 800 steps leading down to the sea. The trail starts in The Bottom between the hospital and Wells Bay. These stairs were used to bring cargo ashore and up to The Bottom. The trail takes approximately 1 hour round trip.

* The Sandy Cruz Trail: It can begin in The Bottom near the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, and end in Hell&#x27;s Gate. The trail has views of Diamond Rock and the northern coastline. It takes roughly 2.5 hours to complete if begun in The Bottom, and 2 if begun in Hell&#x27;s Gate.
* The Crispeen Track (or Crispeen Trail): It can begin on the Mt. Scenery trail and leads down into The Bottom. The trail goes through secondary rainforest, and has overhead views of The Bottom. The trail takes approximately 1-1.5 hours one-way.
* The Bottom Mountain Trail: It can begin in The Bottom near the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, or the junction at Rendezvous on the Mt. Scenery trail. The trail goes through mostly dry forest and some rainforest, and has overhead views of The Bottom.
* Tara Ground Trail: It can begin on the Bottom Mountain Trail or Crispeen Track. The Trail goes through secondary forest and passes by ruins of old farmland. The hike takes about 45 minutes (from the Bottom Mountain trail junction to the Crispeen Track junction).
* Buds Mountain Loop: It is an alternate way to go up or down Mount Scenery. It connects to Bottom Mountain Trail. It goes though secondary rainforest, as well as rainforest near the top. It takes 1.5 hours uphill.
* Parish Hill Trail: It can begin in two different locations in The Bottom, either behind the hospital or at the beginning of the road that leads down to Fort Bay from The Bottom. The trail goes up to the top of Parish Hill, which is a volcanic dome. The hike takes about 1.5 hours.

<text>Oh Mercy is the twenty-sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on September 12, 1989, by Columbia Records. Produced by Daniel Lanois, it was hailed by critics as a triumph for Dylan, after a string of poorly reviewed albums. &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; gave Dylan his best chart showing in years, reaching on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in the United States and in Norway and the UK.

==Background and recording==

The composition of the songs at Dylan&#x27;s home in Malibu and the recording of the album in New Orleans are described by Dylan in detail in the &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; chapter of his memoir &quot;&quot;. Engineer Mark Howard noted that Dylan had previously attempted to record the songs with Ronnie Wood but was dissatisfied with the results: &quot;There&#x27;s a whole version of &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; that was recorded with Ron Wood already. But I think Dylan had maybe decided he didn&#x27;t like what had happened&quot;. In the spring or summer of 1988, U2 singer Bono put Dylan in touch with producer Daniel Lanois, and the two agreed to work together although the recording sessions would not commence until early 1989. Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin notes that Dylan finished recording the basic tracks for the album on March 29, 1989 but added new vocals (and other overdubs) for almost all the tracks the following month.

In their book &quot;Bob Dylan - All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track&quot;, authors Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon call &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; &quot;a renaissance&quot; for Dylan and write of the recording sessions: &quot;The arrangements are very reminiscent of &quot;Yellow Moon&quot; by the Neville Brothers, and Dylan eventually got familiar with this particular atmosphere. Lanois claimed &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; was a record you listen to at night because it was &#x27;designed at night&#x27;: &#x27;Bob had a rule, we only recorded at night. I think he&#x27;s right about that: the body is ready to accommodate a certain tempo at nighttime. I think it&#x27;s something to do with the pushing and pulling of the moon. At nighttime we&#x27;re ready to be more mysterious and dark. &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; is about that&#x27;. He added that if there was one lesson he learned from Dylan, it was working relentlessly while searching first and foremost for efficiency and speed. And he concluded, &quot;&#x27;Oh Mercy&quot; was two guys on a back porch, that kind of vibe&#x27;. As for the songwriter, he recognized &#x27;There&#x27;s something magical about this record&#x27; and felt sincere admiration for the work of the Canadian producer&quot;.

==Outtakes==

During a &quot;Sound Opinions&quot; interview broadcast on Chicago FM radio, Lanois told &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot that &quot;Series of Dreams&quot; was his pick for the opening track, but ultimately, the final decision was Dylan&#x27;s. Music critic Tim Riley would echo these sentiments, writing that Series of Dreams&#x27; should have been the working title song to &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;, not a leftover pendant.&quot; &quot;Series of Dreams&quot; would become the final track on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;, and was later included on 1994&#x27;s &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits Volume 3&quot;. 

&quot;Dignity&quot;, another outtake, was performed live during a 1994 appearance on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, and the same performance was later issued on the accompanying album. A remixed version of &quot;Dignity&quot; featuring new overdubs by producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien was also released on &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits Volume 3&quot;, while the original Lanois production would not see release until the soundtrack album of the television show &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;.

Listed as &quot;Broken Days/Three of Us&quot; on the track sheets, the original version of &quot;Everything Is Broken&quot; was briefly issued on-line as an exclusive download on Apple Computer&#x27;s iTunes music store. In 2008, it was remastered from a better source and reissued on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs&quot;. Described by Heylin as an &quot;evocation of a fragmented relationship&quot;, the lyrics were later rewritten and overdubbed with new vocals and an additional guitar part.

Two more outtakes, &quot;Born in Time&quot; and &quot;God Knows&quot;, were set aside and later re-written and re-recorded for Dylan&#x27;s next album, &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot;. Versions of both songs from the &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; sessions were also included on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs&quot;. &quot;The &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; outtake of &#x27;Born In Time&#x27; was one of those Dylan performances that so surrendered itself to the moment that to decry the lyrical slips would be to mock sincerity itself&quot;, wrote author Clinton Heylin.

==Cover art==
The photo on the cover of the album shows a mural that Dylan came across on a wall of a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan&#x27;s Hell’s Kitchen on 9th Avenue and 53rd Street. The artist, Trotsky, who created the image of two people dancing was located (he lived near the mural) and permission was granted.

==Reception==
After disappointing sales with &quot;Knocked Out Loaded&quot; and &quot;Down in the Groove&quot;, &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; was hailed as a comeback. Consensus was strong enough to place &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; at in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1989. Also in 1989, &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; was ranked on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s.

&quot;Oh Mercy&quot;&#x27;s production drew praise from a majority of critics. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote, &quot;Daniel Lanois&#x27;s understated care and easy beat suit [Dylan&#x27;s] casual ways, and three or four songs might sound like something late at night on the radio, or after the great flood. All are modest and tuneful enough to make you forgive &#x27;Disease of Conceit,&#x27; which is neither.&quot; But as Heylin notes, &quot;Though many a critic who had despaired at the sound of Dylan&#x27;s more recent albums enthused about the sound on &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;, it was evident that rock music&#x27;s foremost lyric writer had also rediscovered his previous flair with words&quot;.

Rock critic Bill Wyman criticized the production but praised the songs. &quot;Taken over by Daniel Lanois, master of a shimmering and distinctive electronically processed guitar sound...[the album] is overdone&quot;, writes Wyman. &quot;It&#x27;s irritating to hear Dylan&#x27;s songs so manipulated, but there are sufficient nice tracks—&quot;Most of the Time&quot;, &quot;Shooting Star&quot;, both simple and direct, among them—to make this by far the most coherent and listenable collection of his own songs Dylan has released since &quot;Desire&quot;&quot;.

Though it did not enter &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 20, &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; remained a consistent seller, enough to be considered a modest commercial success.

To celebrate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, &quot;Montague Street Journal: The Art of Bob Dylan&quot; dedicated roughly half of its debut issue (published in 2009) to a roundtable discussion on &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;.

It was voted number 438 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. During that same year, &quot;Political World&quot; appeared in the film &quot;Man of the Year&quot;. Michael Azerrad in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article felt that &quot;it would be unfair to compare &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; to Dylan&#x27;s landmark Sixties recordings&quot;.

Lou Reed selected &quot;Disease of Conceit&quot; as one of his favorite songs of 1989.

<text>Juraj Beneš (2 March 1940 in Trnava, Slovak State – 10 September 2004 in Bratislava, Slovakia) was a Slovak composer, teacher, and pianist.

He graduated from the university called Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava (VŠMU) and was a pupil of Ján Cikker, who was one of the best known Slovak composers. Since 1983 Beneš taught at the same university.

Beneš&#x27;s work followed current trends and spanned genres. He was best in composing operas such as &quot;Cisárove nové šaty&quot; (The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes), &quot;Skamenený&quot; (Petrified), and &quot;Hostina&quot; (Feast) and often employed the human voice together with unusual instrument combinations as in &quot;Tri ženské zbory&quot; (Three Women&#x27;s Choir).

<text>Nigel James Hitchin FRS (born 2 August 1946) is a British mathematician working in the fields of differential geometry, gauge theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. He is a Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of Oxford.

==Academic career==
Hitchin attended Ecclesbourne School, Duffield, and earned his BA in mathematics from Jesus College, Oxford, in 1968. After moving to Wolfson College, he received his D.Phil. in 1972. From 1971 to 1973 he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and 1973/74 the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University. He then was a research fellow in Oxford and starting in 1979 tutor, lecturer and fellow of St Catherine&#x27;s College. In 1990 he became a professor at the University of Warwick and in 1994 the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. In 1997 he was appointed to the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford, a position he held until his retirement in 2016.

Amongst his notable discoveries are the Hitchin–Thorpe inequality; Hitchin&#x27;s projectively flat connection over Teichmüller space; the Atiyah–Hitchin monopole metric; the Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem; the ADHM construction of instantons (of Michael Atiyah, Vladimir Drinfeld, Hitchin, and Yuri Manin); the hyperkähler quotient (of Hitchin, Anders Karlhede, Ulf Lindström and Martin Roček); Higgs bundles, which arise as solutions to the Hitchin equations, a 2-dimensional reduction of the self-dual Yang–Mills equations; and the Hitchin system, an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system associated to the data of an algebraic curve and a complex reductive group. He and Shoshichi Kobayashi independently conjectured the Kobayashi–Hitchin correspondence. Higgs bundles, which are also developed in the work of Carlos Simpson, are closely related to the Hitchin system, which has an interpretation as a moduli space of semistable Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface or algebraic curve. This moduli space has emerged as a focal point for deep connections between algebraic geometry, differential geometry, hyperkähler geometry, mathematical physics, and representation theory. 

In his article on generalized Calabi–Yau manifolds, he introduced the notion of generalized complex manifolds, providing a single structure that incorporates, as examples, Poisson manifolds, symplectic manifolds and complex manifolds. These have found wide applications as the geometries of flux compactifications in string theory and also in topological string theory.

In the span of his career, Hitchin has supervised 37 research students, including Simon Donaldson (part-supervised with Atiyah).

Until 2013 Nigel Hitchin served as the managing editor of the journal &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot;.

==Honours and awards==

In 1991 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 2003 he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Bath.

Hitchin was elected as an Honorary Fellow of Jesus College in 1998, and the Senior Berwick Prize (1990), the Sylvester Medal (2000) and the Pólya Prize (2002) have been awarded to him in honour of his far-reaching work. A conference was held in honour of his 60th birthday, in conjunction with the 2006 International Congress of Mathematicians in Spain.

In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2014 he was awarded another Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Warwick. In 2016 he received the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences.

<text>Orthoepy is the study of pronunciation of a particular language, within a specific oral tradition. The term is from the Greek , from () and (). The antonym is &quot;cacoepy&quot; &quot;bad or wrong pronunciation&quot;. The pronunciation of the word &quot;orthoepy&quot; itself varies widely; the OED recognizes the variants , , , and for British English, as well as for American English.

The pronunciation is sometimes clarified with a diaeresis: &quot;orthoëpy&quot;, such as in the title of Edward Barrett Warman&#x27;s &quot;Warman&#x27;s Practical Orthoëpy and Critique&quot;, published in 1888 and found in Google Books.

Warman states on page 5: &quot;Words possess three special characteristics: They have their Eye-life—Orthography. Ear-life—Orthoëpy. Soul-life—Significance.&quot; As with Warman&#x27;s book, the purpose of this article is &quot;to deal exclusively with the ear-life, or orthoëpy&quot;.

==Overview==
In English grammar, orthoepy is the study of correct pronunciation prescribed for Standard English. This originally was understood to mean Received Pronunciation specifically, but other standards have emerged and been accepted since the early 20th century (e.g., General American, General Australian).

In ancient Greek, ὀρθοέπεια &quot;orthoepeia&quot; had the wider sense of &quot;correct diction&quot; (cf. LSJ ad loc., or the etymology in the OED), referencing correct pronunciation not just of individual words but also of entire passages, especially poetry, along with the distinction of good poetry vs. bad poetry. The archaic English term for this subject is orthology, and in this sense its opposite is &quot;solecism&quot;. The study of orthoepeia by the Greek sophists of the 5th century BCE, especially Prodicus (c. 396 BCE) and Protagoras, also included proto-logical concepts.

<doc id="1034172" wikidata="Q156207" url="?curid=1034172" title="Gladiolus">
<text>Gladiolus (from Latin, the diminutive of &quot;gladius&quot;, a sword) is a genus of perennial cormous flowering plants in the iris family (Iridaceae).

It is sometimes called the &#x27;sword lily&#x27;, but is usually called by its generic name (plural &quot;gladioli&quot;).

The genus occurs in Asia, Mediterranean Europe, South Africa, and tropical Africa. The center of diversity is in the Cape Floristic Region. The genera &quot;Acidanthera&quot;, &quot;Anomalesia&quot;, &quot;Homoglossum&quot;, and &quot;Oenostachys&quot;, formerly considered distinct, are now included in &quot;Gladiolus&quot;.

==Description==
Gladioli grow from round, symmetrical corms (similar to crocuses) that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics.

Their stems are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved leaves, enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section. The adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the leaf exhibit micro-striations with aligned micro-protrusions, which are coated with waxy nano-flakes. This three-level surface structure enables the leaf to shed rainfall droplets in a unidirectional manner due to anisotropic superhydrophobicity features, as reported by Mahesh C. Dubey &quot;et al.&quot; 

The flowers of unmodified wild species vary from very small to perhaps 40 mm across, and inflorescences bearing anything from one to several flowers. The spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce are the products of centuries of hybridisation and selection.

The flower spikes are large and one-sided, with secund, bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery, green bracts. The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three stamens. The outer three tepals are narrower. The perianth is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three filiform, spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex.

The ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules, containing many, winged brown, longitudinally dehiscent seeds.

These flowers are variously coloured, ranging from pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red.

== Ecology ==
The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthophorini bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by sunbirds, noctuid and Hawk-moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolus can be pollinated by small well-known wasps. Actually, they are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps. Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth &quot;Macroglossum stellatarum&quot; which usually pollinates many popular garden flowers like &quot;Petunia&quot;, &quot;Zinnia&quot;, &quot;Dianthus&quot; and others.

Gladioli are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Large Yellow Underwing, and gladiolus thrips.

== Horticulture ==

Gladioli have been extensively hybridized and a wide range of ornamental flower colours are available from the many varieties. The main hybrid groups have been obtained by crossing between four or five species, followed by selection: &#x27;Grandiflorus&#x27;, &#x27;Primulines&#x27; and &#x27;Nanus&#x27;. They can make very good cut flowers for display.

The majority of the species in this genus are diploid with 30 chromosomes (2n=30) but the Grandiflora hybrids are tetraploid and possess 60 chromosomes (2n=4x=60). This is because the main parental species of these hybrids is &quot;Gladiolus dalenii&quot; which is also tetraploid and includes a wide range of varieties (like the Grandiflora hybrids).

== Gallery ==
==Cultivation==
In temperate zones, the corms of most species and hybrids should be lifted in autumn and stored over winter in a frost-free place, then replanted in spring. Some species from Europe and high altitudes in Africa, as well as the small &#x27;Nanus&#x27; hybrids, are much hardier (to at least ) and can be left in the ground in regions with sufficiently dry winters. &#x27;Nanus&#x27; is hardy to Zones 5–8. The large-flowered types require moisture during the growing season, and must be individually staked as soon as the sword-shaped flower heads appear. The leaves must be allowed to die down naturally before lifting and storing the corms. Plants are propagated either from small cormlets produced as offsets by the parent corms, or from seed. In either case, they take several years to get to flowering size. Clumps should be dug up and divided every few years to keep them vigorous.

They are affected by thrips, (thrip simplex), and wasps &quot;Dasyproctus bipunctatus&quot;, which burrow into the flowers causing them to collapse and die.

Numerous garden cultivars have been developed, of which ‘Robinetta’ (a &quot;G. recurvus&quot; hybrid), with pink flowers, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==In culture==
* Gladiolus is the birth flower of August.
* Gladioli are the flowers associated with a fortieth wedding anniversary.
* American Ragtime composer Scott Joplin composed a rag called “Gladiolus Rag”
* &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was the word Frank Neuhauser correctly spelled to win the 1st National Spelling Bee in 1925.
* The Australian comedian and personality Dame Edna Everage&#x27;s signature flowers were gladioli, which she referred to as &quot;gladdies&quot;.
* The ancient Graeco-Roman god Pluto was said to wear a wreath of what is traditionally identified as a type of Gladiolus, called &quot;phasganion&quot; or &quot;xiphion&quot; in Koine Greek.
* The Mancunian singer Morrissey is known to dance with gladioli hanging from his back pocket or in his hands, especially during the era of The Smiths. This trait of his was made known in the music video for &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, where he swung a bunch of yellow gladioli while singing.
* Gladioli are traditionally given to people who finish the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen. This likely derives from their association with victory, from the time when gladiators were showered with them upon victory.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Gladiolus&quot; contains about 300 species, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families had over 276 species in 1988, , it accepted 300 species.

There are 260 species of &quot;Gladiolus&quot; endemic to southern Africa, and 76 in tropical Africa. 
About 10 species are native to Eurasia.

<text>Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grâce, baron de Cloots (24 June 1755 – 24 March 1794), better known as Anacharsis Cloots (also spelled Clootz), was a Prussian nobleman who was a significant figure in the French Revolution. Perhaps the first to advocate a world parliament, an idea later espoused by Albert Camus and Albert Einstein, he was a world federalist and an internationalist anarchist. He was nicknamed &quot;orator of mankind&quot;, &quot;citizen of humanity&quot; and &quot;a personal enemy of God&quot;. American author Herman Melville refers to an &quot;Anacharsis Clootz delegation&quot; as a representation of global humanity in both &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851), &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot;, and later in &quot;Billy Budd&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born near Kleve, at the castle of , he belonged to a noble Prussian family of Dutch Protestant origin. The young Cloots, heir to a great fortune, was sent to Paris at age eleven to complete his education, and became attracted to the theories of his uncle the &quot;abbé&quot; Cornelius de Pauw (1739–1799), &quot;philosophe&quot;, geographer and diplomat at the court of Frederick II of Prussia. His father placed him in the military academy of Berlin, but he withdrew at the age of twenty and travelled through Europe, preaching his revolutionary philosophy and spending his money as a man of pleasure.

===Revolution===

On the breaking out of the Revolution, Cloots returned in 1789 to Paris, thinking the opportunity favorable for establishing his dream of a universal family of nations. On 19 June 1790 he appeared at the bar of the National Constituent Assembly at the head of thirty-six foreigners, and, in the name of this embassy of the human race, declared that the world adhered to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. After this, he was known as the orator of the human race, by which title he called himself, dropping that of baron, and substituting for his baptismal names the pseudonym of Anacharsis, from Jean-Jacques Barthélemy&#x27;s famous philosophical romance &quot;Travels of Anacharsis the Younger in Greece&quot;.

In 1792 he placed 12,000 livres at the disposal of the French Republic for the arming of forty or fifty fighters in the cause of man against tyranny (&quot;see French Revolutionary Wars&quot;). After the riots of 10 August he became an even more prominent supporter of new ideas, and declared himself &quot;the personal enemy of Jesus Christ&quot;, abjuring all revealed religions.

===Convention===
In the same month he had the rights of French citizenship conferred on him; and, having in September been elected a member of the National Convention, he voted in favor of capital punishment for King Louis XVI, justifying it in the name of the human race, and was an active partisan of the war of propaganda.

===Execution===
Excluded at the insistence of Maximilien Robespierre from the Jacobin Club, he remained a foreigner in many eyes. When the Committee of Public Safety levelled accusations of treason against the Hébertists, they also implicated Cloots to give substance to their charge of a foreign plot. Although his innocence was manifest, he was condemned and subsequently guillotined on 24 March 1794. He incongruously followed Vincent, Ronsin, Momoro and the rest of the Hébertist leadership to the scaffold, in front of the largest crowd ever assembled for a public execution. Their death was a sort of carnival, a pleasant spectacle according to Michelet&#x27;s witnesses.

==Thought==
Cloots was an original political thinker who crafted his own interpretation of the meaning of the French Revolution. He was a proponent of the world state, and he sought to promote a more broad-minded and internationalist understanding of the Revolution&#x27;s potential. He imagined the institutions of the world state along the lines of those of the French Revolutionary Republic. Cloots&#x27;s thought was expressed in several works, most importantly in his &quot;Bases constitutionnelles de la République du genre humain&quot;.

<text>The  (FIFé) (International Feline Federation) is a federation of cat registries. There are currently forty-two member organizations in forty countries. Membership spans Europe, South America, and Asia. FIFé is one of the nine members of the World Cat Congress.

==History==
Founded by Marguerite Ravel, the federation was unofficially started in 1949 in Paris, France, at a meeting between the (French Cat Federation), the Royal Cat Society of Flanders, and the (Italian National Feline Association). At the organisation&#x27;s first general assembly, in Ghent, Belgium, the federation was officially founded. For the occasion, all participants received a cat shaped statuette, in pink sandstone, that Marguerite Ravel had commissioned from the sculptor Jan Martel.

The original name was or FIFE. In 1972, the Brazilian Cat Club joined, making it necessary to change the Euro-centric name of the federation. The was dropped, and the abbreviation was changed to FIFé.

==Organisation==
FIFé is organized into national sub-federations (e.g. Felis Britannica in the United Kingdom) which handle pedigree registrations, cat shows and awards in each country. FIFé&#x27;s executive board and general assembly are supported by five commissions: 
*Judges and Standards Commission
*Breeding and Registration Commission
*Show Commission
*Health and Welfare Commission
*Disciplinary Commission

<text>Air Marshal Sir John Tremayne Babington, (20 July 1891 – 20 March 1979) was a senior commander in the Royal Air Force. In 1944, he retired and the following year changed his name to Tremayne, his mother&#x27;s maiden name, to avoid confusion with his younger brother, Philip Babington.

He was educated at Osborne and Dartmouth Royal Navy colleges.

==RAF career==
Babington was commissioned as a Midshipman in the Royal Navy in 1908. During the First World War, Babington was a member of the Royal Naval Air Service. He participated in the air raid on the Friedrichshaven Airship Factory, Germany on 21 November 1914. On 2 January 1920, Babington was removed from the Navy List and awarded a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force. He was appointed Station Commander at RAF Gosport in 1927 and went on to be a Station Commander in Iraq in January 1929 before becoming British Air Representative to the League of Nations in November 1929. He became Station Commander of RAF Halton and Commandant, No. 1 School of Technical Training in 1934, Air Officer Commanding No. 24 Group in 1936 and Air Officer Commanding, RAF Far East Command in 1938.

He served in the Second World War as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Technical Training Command and then Head of RAF Mission in Moscow before retiring in 1944.

In retirement he served as High Sheriff of Cornwall.

<doc id="1034202" wikidata="Q676863" url="?curid=1034202" title="ArmaLite AR-10">
<text>The ArmaLite AR-10 is a 7.62×51mm NATO battle rifle designed by Eugene Stoner in the late 1950s and manufactured by ArmaLite (then a division of the Fairchild Aircraft Corporation). When first introduced in 1956, the AR-10 used an innovative combination of a straight-line barrel/stock design with phenolic composite, a new patent-filed gas-operated bolt and carrier system and forged alloy parts resulting in a small arm significantly easier to control in automatic fire and over lighter than other infantry rifles of the day. Over its production life, the original AR-10 was built in relatively small numbers, with fewer than 10,000 rifles assembled. However, the ArmaLite AR-10 would become the progenitor for a wide range of firearms.

In 1957, the basic AR-10 design was rescaled and substantially modified by ArmaLite to accommodate the .223 Remington cartridge, and given the designation ArmaLite AR-15.

In 1959, ArmaLite sold its rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 to Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company due to financial difficulties, and limitations in terms of manpower and production capacity. After modifications (most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver), the new redesigned rifle (the AR-15), and a change of the caliber to 5.56x45mm NATO, was subsequently adopted by the U.S. military as the M16 rifle. Colt continued to use the AR-15 trademark for its line of semi-automatic-only rifles, which it marketed to civilian and law-enforcement customers as the Colt AR-15.

==History and development==
ArmaLite began as a small engineering company founded by George Sullivan, the patent counsel for Lockheed Corporation, and funded by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. On October 1, 1954, the company was incorporated as the ArmaLite Corporation, becoming a subdivision of Fairchild. With its limited capital and tiny machine shop, ArmaLite was never intended to be an arms manufacturer. The company focused on producing small arms concepts and designs to be sold or licensed to other manufacturers. Sullivan leased a small machine shop in Hollywood, California, hired several employees, and began work on a prototype for a lightweight survival rifle for use by downed aircrew.

While testing the prototype of the ArmaLite AR-5 survival rifle design at a local shooting range, Sullivan met Eugene Stoner, a small arms inventor, whom Sullivan hired to be ArmaLite&#x27;s chief design engineer. At the time, ArmaLite Inc. was a very small organization (as late as 1956 it had only nine employees, including Stoner). With Stoner as the chief design engineer, ArmaLite quickly released a number of unique rifle concepts.

The first prototypes of the 7.62 mm AR-10 emerged between 1955 and early 1956. At the time, the United States Army was in the midst of testing several rifles to replace the obsolete M1 Garand. Springfield Armory&#x27;s T44E4 and heavier T44E5 were essentially updated versions of the Garand chambered for the new 7.62 mm round, while Fabrique Nationale submitted their FN FAL as the T48.

ArmaLite&#x27;s AR-10 entered the competition late, hurriedly submitting two hand-built &quot;production&quot; AR-10 rifles based on the fourth prototype in the fall of 1956 to the United States Army&#x27;s Springfield Armory for testing. The AR-10 prototypes (four in all) featured a straight-line stock design, rugged elevated sights, an oversized aluminum flash suppressor and recoil compensator, and an adjustable gas system. In the fourth and final prototype, the upper and lower receiver were hinged with the now-familiar hinge and takedown pins, and the charging handle did not reciprocate and was not attached to the bolt carrier. For a 7.62mm NATO rifle, the AR-10 prototype was incredibly lightweight at only 6.85 lb empty. Initial comments by Springfield Armory test staff were favorable, and some testers commented that the AR-10 was the best lightweight automatic rifle tested by the Armory.

The rifle&#x27;s aluminum/steel composite barrel (an untried prototype design specified for the tests by ArmaLite&#x27;s president, George Sullivan, over Stoner&#x27;s vehement objections) burst in a torture test conducted by Springfield Armory in early 1957. ArmaLite quickly replaced it with a conventional steel barrel, but the damage had been done. The final Springfield Armory report advised against the adoption of the rifle, stating that it would take &quot;five years or more to take it through tests to adoption&quot;. While ArmaLite objected, it was clear that the AR-10, a brand-new rifle still in the prototype stage, was at a disadvantage compared to competing designs with longer development cycles, and by 1957, U.S. Army infantry forces urgently required a modern, magazine-fed infantry rifle to replace the M1. In the end, the Army chose the conventional T44, which entered production as the M14 rifle in 1957. That same year, ArmaLite completed about 50 production AR-10 rifles at its workshop for use as demonstrator models for its sales agents, including Samuel Cummings, a famous international arms dealer. Attempts to rush completion of these fifty rifles resulted in a few units that were assembled with improperly machined barrel extensions, a defect that went unnoticed at the time. These production rifles built at ArmaLite&#x27;s workshop in Hollywood would later become known as the &quot;Hollywood&quot; model.

On July 4, 1957, Fairchild ArmaLite sold a five-year manufacturing license for the AR-10 to the Dutch arms manufacturer, Artillerie Inrichtingen (A.I.). With its large factory and production facilities, A.I. could produce the ArmaLite rifle in large quantities for which Fairchild expected orders would be forthcoming.

In 1957, Cummings secured an order of 7,500 AR-10 rifles from Nicaragua, with an initial delivery of 1,000 rifles to be delivered before January 1958. The order was contingent on a successful completion of a 7,500-round endurance test. With the AR-10 in short supply, Cummings left his personal demonstrator rifle with Nicaragua&#x27;s chief military commander, General Anastasio Somoza, who personally conducted the endurance test trial. While General Somoza was firing this rifle for the trial, the bolt lug over the ejector sheared off and flew past Somoza&#x27;s head. The general angrily returned Cummings&#x27; AR-10 and canceled the entire Nicaraguan order. The remaining Hollywood rifles were inspected and refitted as necessary with new parts to prevent the reoccurrence of the bolt lug failure, but the Nicaraguan order was lost for good.

A.I. officials meanwhile discovered a number of manufacturing and production issues in the Hollywood version of the AR-10, all of which had to be resolved before large-scale production could commence. In addition to designing and building tooling for the rifle, the design had to be converted to metric dimensions and subcontractors had to be found to supply materials or manufacture component parts. ArmaLite also continued to send A.I. product improvement requests, including an adjustable regulator, a repositioned gas tube, and a new three-prong flash suppressor. Accessories such as flash hiders, bayonet mounts, sling swivels, and sight graduations had to be designed.

Firearms historians have separated AR-10 production under the A.I. license into at least three basic identifiable versions, along with various sporting, carbine, and other experimental designs and calibers. The three main variants have been termed the &quot;Sudanese&quot; model, the &quot;Transitional&quot;, and the &quot;Portuguese&quot; model AR-10. A.I. built all of these rifles, beginning with the Sudanese model AR-10. The Sudanese version derives its name from the sale of approximately 2,500 AR-10 rifles to the government of Sudan in 1958. The Sudanese model was equipped with a very lightweight, fluted steel barrel fitted with a trim, prong-style flash suppressor, a bayonet lug, lightweight fiberglass furniture, and sight graduations in Arabic. The Sudanese model weighed only with an empty magazine. The price, including cleaning kit and four magazines, was US $225 per rifle. All AR-10s, whether produced by ArmaLite or by A.I., used the same Stoner-designed 20-round lightweight aluminum &#x27;waffle&#x27; magazine with pressed-in, corrugated sides, intended to be discarded in combat once emptied.

AR-10 production was limited, though Guatemala, Burma, Italy, Cuba, Sudan and Portugal all purchased AR-10 rifles for limited issue to their military forces. Sudanese AR-10s were employed in frequent clashes with guerrilla forces and conflicts with neighboring countries, and a few captured rifles eventually turned up in unofficial service with various African and colonial armies, police, and guerrilla forces. The AR-10 remained in service with Sudanese Special Forces until 1985.

In 1958, a special 7.62×39mm caliber variant of the Sudanese AR-10 was produced in very small numbers for evaluation by Finland and Germany. That same year, an AR-10 with a 16&quot; barrel was developed in response to a request by KLM Airlines for a carbine that could be issued to their crew for transpolar flights as part of an Arctic survival kit, and approximately 30 carbines were eventually produced. A number of Transitional AR-10s were also fitted with a folding bipod designed to lie flat under the forearm.

The Italian Navy acquired the AR-10 for its COMSUBIN underwater commando teams. Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Finland, and South Africa also purchased small numbers of the AR-10 for test purposes, and Cuba&#x27;s Batista government ordered 100 &quot;Transitional&quot; model rifles in 1958. The Cuban order was delivered to Havana, but in December 1958 Fidel Castro&#x27;s forces took control of the country, including the warehouse containing the AR-10 shipment. In 1959, in response to a letter from ArmaLite&#x27;s sales agent Sam Cummings, Castro invited Cummings to Havana to discuss payment for the AR-10 rifles. Fidel, his brother Raúl, and Che Guevara test-fired the AR-10 outside Havana. Impressed by the weapon&#x27;s firepower, Castro paid Cummings for all 100 rifles.

However, rapidly worsening relations with the United States eliminated any chance of future AR-10 sales to Cuba, and Castro transferred the ex-Batista AR-10s to a group of Communist revolutionaries from the Dominican Republic. In June 1959, the rebels, led by Cuban officers, invaded the Dominican Republic. The invaders were defeated by the Dominican Army, and AR-10 rifles from the Batista shipment were found on the bodies of guerrillas.

The final Artillerie Inrichtingen design is known as the &quot;Portuguese&quot; model AR-10. This final version incorporated all that had been learned to date about the AR-10, including infantry service rifle and field test reports. In addition to a heavier barrel with chrome-lined chamber, optional bipod, and the removable plastic/metal handguards of the Transitional model, the Portuguese variant had wider bolt lugs, a stronger extractor, a new simplified three-position gas regulator, and a cocking handle featuring a forward bolt assist. It is believed that approximately 4,000-5,000 Portuguese variants were produced; nearly all of them were sold to the Portuguese National Defense Ministry by the Brussels-based arms dealer SIDEM International in 1960. The AR-10 was officially adopted by the Portuguese paratrooper battalions (&quot;Caçadores páraquedistas&quot;), and the rifle saw considerable combat service in Portugal&#x27;s counter-insurgency campaigns in Angola and Mozambique.

In U.S. Army tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground in November 1960, and later in Portuguese service, the AR-10 gained a reputation for accuracy (some rifles would group into 25 mm (1 inch) at 100 meters with service ammunition). Portuguese paratroopers found the AR-10 to be not only accurate but reliable in combat, despite rugged service conditions in African jungle and savannah.

A few Portuguese and Sudanese model AR-10s found their way by various means to nearby African countries; in Chad, the AR-10 was much appreciated by members of the French Foreign Legion. As one police instructor in the Congo stated, &quot;It was a good combat weapon that never failed me; a bit too long (but not as bad as the FAL or M14) for house-to-house work or really heavy brush, but great for 400-800 meters, in the flats - and really nice on the body, after wandering around 12-14 hours looking for bad guys.&quot;

Some Portuguese-model AR-10s were fitted with A.I.-modified upper receivers in order to mount 3× or 3.6× telescopic sights. These rifles were used by marksmen accompanying small patrols to eliminate individual enemies at extended ranges in open country. Other AR-10s were used by the paratroopers in a secondary role to launch rifle grenades. The AR-10&#x27;s built-in gas cutoff design enabled it to fire Energa rifle grenades without adjustment of the gas system, and the self-loading action would even eject the spent blank shells and load the next one, allowing several grenades to be quickly fired. The added recoil took its toll on rifle stocks, and some Portuguese rifles were retrofitted with all-metal butt stocks to better withstand the strain caused by firing the heavy grenades. Additional sales of the AR-10 rifle were stymied after the Netherlands embargoed further shipments of the rifle to Portugal. Paratroopers deploying to Africa in later years were subsequently issued a collapsible stock version of the German Heckler &amp; Koch G3 rifle. Nevertheless, the AR-10 continued in service with a few Portuguese airborne units and was in use as late as 1975 in the Portuguese Timor (now East Timor) decolonization emergency.

Fairchild-ArmaLite was dissatisfied with the delays in setting up the tooling and production at A.I. for the AR-10, and made it clear that they would not be renewing A.I.&#x27;s license to produce the rifle. By 1960, hampered by Dutch export restrictions and discouraged by the lack of arms sales to major national purchasers, Artillerie Inrichtingen decided to exit the small arms production business altogether, and ceased all production of the AR-10 under its license from Fairchild-ArmaLite. By that time, fewer than 10,000 AR-10s had been produced, mostly military select-fire rifles, with a few semi-automatic only rifles produced for civilian use. All A.I. AR-10 parts inventories, tooling, and prototypes were either sold or scrapped; the barrel tooling was sold to Israel sometime in the early 1960s. All AR-10 production records, design drawings, manuals, literature, and other publications then in inventory were discarded.

In later years, some ex-military Sudanese and Portuguese model AR-10s were sold to civilian markets in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Nearly all of the rifles imported to the latter three countries had their full-automatic fire selector disabled. Subsequently, as many as 2,500 Australian AR-10 rifles may have been confiscated and destroyed as a result of more restrictive firearms legislation passed in 1997.

Most of the AR-10 ex-military rifles shipped to the United States were in the form of parts kits, having been previously dismantled, though a few were legally imported as National Firearms Act (NFA) weapons. Large numbers of AR-10 7.62 mm magazines were imported as well. Many of these kit rifles were combined with various semi-auto receivers made by civilian manufacturers in order to permit legal ownership. During the early 1980s, Paragon Sales and Services in Joliet, Illinois, manufactured new semi-automatic lower receivers while using imported upper AR-10 receivers originally manufactured by Artillerie Inrichtingen in the Netherlands.

In 1957, in an effort to increase profits from the ArmaLite venture, Fairchild decided to compete in the U.S. Army&#x27;s CONARC requirement for a new six-pound, high-velocity, .22-caliber selective-fire rifle accurate to 500 yards. In response, ArmaLite engineers Eugene Stoner, Jim Sullivan, and Bob Fremont used the basic AR-10 design to produce the ArmaLite AR-15 in .223 Remington, which was completed as a firing prototype in 1958. Fairchild-ArmaLite continued its efforts to sell both the AR-10 and AR-15 to various military forces around the world. However, the AR-10 rifle marketed by ArmaLite after 1958 was not the product-improved AR-10 developed by Artillerie Inrichtingen, but rather a design scaled-up from AR-15 plans and specifications, the AR-10A. None of the improvements incorporated by Artillerie Inrichtingen over three years of production were used in the new AR-10A.

Although the AR-10A did not benefit from the modifications undertaken by the Dutch licensee, it had some differences from the AR-15 (besides caliber and part dimensions), including a different bolt, trigger, and cocking handle design, along with a magazine canted forward at a five-degree angle. While interest in the AR-15 was considerable, the AR-10A failed to attract any orders from domestic or foreign military customers.

In 1959, ArmaLite sold its rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 to Colt Firearms due to financial difficulties, and limitations in terms of manpower and production capacity. After modifications (most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver), the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted by the U.S. military as the M16 rifle. Colt continued to use the AR-15 trademark for its line of semi-automatic rifles marketed to civilian and law-enforcement customers, known as Colt AR-15.

==Design details==

The AR-10 is a lightweight, air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated rifle that uses a piston within the bolt carrier with a rotary bolt locking mechanism. The rifle has a conventional layout; it features an in-line stock, an aluminum alloy receiver and a fiberglass reinforced pistol grip, handguard, and buttstock. As part of the weight-saving design philosophy, in the designer points out that:

While mostly an original design, the AR-10 built upon previously proven concepts. From the FAL it took the hinged receiver system allowing the rifle to be opened for cleaning much like a break-action shotgun. The ejection port cover is similar to that found on the German World War II-era StG44. The bolt locking mechanism is similar to the M1941 Johnson rifle (itself an adaptation of the Browning-designed Remington Model 8 bolt). From the German MG 13 light machine gun, FG 42 and M1941 Johnson machine gun came the idea of the straight-line stock layout. A &quot;straight-line&quot; recoil configuration increases controllability during burst or automatic fire by reducing muzzle climb. The AR-10&#x27;s method of rotary bolt locking, straight-line recoil, and gas operation enhanced its inherent accuracy.

The original AR-10 action (later developed into the ArmaLite AR-15 and M16 rifle) designed by Eugene Stoner is commonly called a direct impingement system, but it does not utilize a conventional direct impingement system. In , the designer states:

The gas system, bolt carrier, and bolt-locking design were novel for the time. Most gas-operated rifles divert combustion gases from a port in the barrel to a piston and cylinder arrangement adjacent to the port. In Stoner&#x27;s design, the gas travels from a port near the middle of the barrel through a steel tube back into the receiver. The gas enters a chamber inside the bolt carrier formed between the rear of the bolt and the inside of the bolt carrier. The bolt within the bolt carrier is fitted with piston rings to contain the gas. Once the bolt carrier moves to the rear a small distance, excess gas is vented through holes in its side. This use of the bolt and bolt carrier for the separate actions of a piston and gas cylinder simplified construction and saved weight. The Stoner bolt and carrier piston system is however ammunition specific, since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior. Movement of the bolt carrier was in-line with the bore, greatly improving inherent accuracy, as well as keeping the rifle on target as the gun fired. Since the straight-line stock placed the shooter&#x27;s eye well above the barrel the rifle&#x27;s sights were mounted high, with the rear sight and elevation wheel calibrated for 7×51mm NATO for specific range settings contained in a carrying handle that also protected the cocking/charging lever. Windage was zeroed by drifting the rear sight.

The receiver is made from forged and machined aluminum to reduce weight. The bolt locks into an extension on the barrel instead of the receiver allowing for a lightweight receiver while not compromising the strength of the bolt locking mechanism. On a few prototype guns, an all-aluminum (&quot;Sullaloy&quot;) barrel was fitted at the insistence of George Sullivan – ArmaLite&#x27;s president – though after the 1957 Springfield Armory tests, all production AR-10s were fitted with standard steel barrels. The stock is made from a fiberglass-reinforced phenolic composite with a core of rigid plastic foam. The handguards and pistol grip are also fiberglass reinforced plastic. Fairchild was an aircraft manufacturer, and the use of plastics, titanium, and aluminum were common in the aircraft industry at the time, though not generally used in firearms.

Several experimental prototypes of a belt-fed variant of the AR-10 were developed by ArmaLite and A.I. engineers, informally designated the AR-10 LMG. In one version, the belt was fed by a feed-chute connected to a 250-round ammo box carried on the user&#x27;s back. All of the belt-fed prototypes experienced numerous issues with feed malfunctions and parts breakages, and these problems were never wholly solved during the weapon&#x27;s development stage, which ended with the termination of A.I.&#x27;s production contract. As a result, no AR-10 LMG variants were ever sold.

==Semi-automatic only AR-10 production==
===ArmaLite AR-10B series===

In 1995, former Army Ordnance officer Mark Westrom, owner of Eagle Arms, purchased the ArmaLite brand and the company became ArmaLite Inc. Shortly thereafter, ArmaLite Inc. introduced the completely new semi-automatic-only AR-10B rifle series. Notably, the AR-10B was not designed using the original AR-10 drawings from either ArmaLite or Artillerie Inrichtingen, but instead was based on the AR-15A2, with parts scaled up or redesigned as needed to fire the 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) cartridge. The AR-10B prototype was composed of individual sub-components tested on a special lower receiver made of two slabs of aluminum fitted to a Knight&#x27;s Armament Company SR-25 upper receiver assembly, and prototyped using computer analysis. The full prototype AR-10B was the first rifle off the production line.

Since 1995, the new ArmaLite company has also incorporated various other design and engineering improvements to the AR-10, including a newly designed steel magazine derived from the model used on the U.S. M14 rifle. The current ArmaLite AR-10 is offered in several versions including an A2 and A4 rifle or carbine with a collapsible stock, a target model (AR-10T), a &quot;retro&quot; AR-10B with Sudanese AR-10-style handguard and cocking lever (limited production) and one version chambered in 300 Remington SAUM. Current users include the Ontario Provincial Police Tactics and Rescue Unit.

===New ArmaLite AR-10A series===
After introducing the AR-10B model in 1996 which switched from the original pattern magazines to modified M14 magazines, ArmaLite reintroduced their original magazine pattern with their new AR-10A model in 2012 (also called SR-25 pattern magazine).

==Other .308/7.62x51 caliber ArmaLite type rifles==
While ArmaLite Inc. holds a US trademark on the name &quot;AR-10&quot;, other rifle manufacturers currently produce 7.62×51mm NATO auto-loading rifles that are based generally on the AR-10 design. These rifles differ from both the current and original ArmaLite AR10 in a few minor dimensions that make the ArmaLite AR10B not as modular as the rest of the AR-based firearms.

<text>Windwardside is the second largest town on the Dutch Caribbean island of Saba, aptly named for being on the windward side of the island.

== History ==
The first permanent European settlements on Saba began in the 1640s. By the 1860s, Windwardside was one of 7 main districts on the island, with The Bottom, St. John&#x27;s, Booby Hill, Hell&#x27;s Gate, Mary&#x27;s Point (Palmetto Point), and Middle Island. The Windwardside district had its own elected head, as did the other six districts. In 1860, the St. Paul&#x27;s Conversion Church, Saba was built on the grounds of the former quarantine station in Windwardside. In 1865, the population of Windwardside was 573 inhabitants.

Throughout the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, most men in Windwardside engaged in farming or fishing. Most women engaged in domestic work in the home, as well as local drawn thread work known as Saba Lace.

By 1900, Windwardside was one of four main villages on Saba, along with The Bottom, St. John&#x27;s, and Hell&#x27;s Gate. The early- to mid- 1900s saw extensive emigration from Saba. In 1972, the population of Windwardside had decreased to 302 inhabitants.

In the late 20th century, Windwardside began expanding. The Tourism Office opened in Windwardside along with restaurants, grocery stores, a bank, a post office, hotels, and gift shops. In 2001, the population of Windwardside was 418 inhabitants.

==Geography==
Most of Windwardside is located in a saddle between a dormant volcano (Mount Scenery) and a hill (Booby Hill). The saddle&#x27;s elevation is about 1,400 ft (427 m) above sea level. Some Windwardside homes are located up the mountainside of village. Many homes are located up the hillside of the village, on Booby Hill and an area of Booby Hill called The Level. The elevation of The Level is about 1,584 feet (483 m) above sea level. The Mas Cojones Hill is also a scenic tourist destination.

==Tourism==
Windwardside has several hotels and inns which serve mostly tourists who come to the island to dive and enjoy Saba&#x27;s nature. There are multiple grocery stores, restaurants, gift shops, and a dive shop located there as well.

The Harry L. Johnson Museum is located in Windwardside. The museum is located inside an authentic 19th-century Saban cottage, with few changes having been made to the original cottage. Inside, visitors can view 19th and early 20th-century furniture, linens, china, nautical instruments, and a 100-year old organ harmonium. Also on display are photographs and documents, as well as Amerindian artifacts from archaeological sites on the island. The museum grounds feature tropical vegetation and a children&#x27;s play area.

The Mt. Scenery Trail, Saba&#x27;s most popular hiking trail, begins in Windwardside. The trailhead is located on the road just outside Windwardside, across from the Trail Shop. The trail is a strenuous out-and-back trail, which goes up to Mt. Scenery&#x27;s summit and back, and takes about 90 minutes each way.

<text>Gaston Glock (; 19 July 1929 – 27 December 2023) was an Austrian engineer and businessman. He founded the company Glock. When he entered the 1980 competition for a new Austrian service pistol, he hired two engineers who had worked on the development of HK&#x27;s first two polymer-frame pistols, the VP70 and P9 models. The first Glock pistol, chambered in 9x19mm and named the Glock 17 because it was Glock&#x27;s 17th patent, entered Austrian military and police service in 1982. It became one of the most influential and popular handguns of the 20th century, leading to a succession of other models in a variety of sizes and chamberings as well as an industry-wide trend toward polymer-frame, striker-fired pistols.

Glock was born in Vienna on 19 July 1929. He was conscripted into the Wehrmacht as a teenager near the end of World War II, after which he graduated from school as an engineer and joined a hand drill company.

==Manufacturing==
Glock began as a manufacturer of curtain rods in the 1960s, and knives for the Austrian military in the 1970s, and did not design or manufacture a firearm until he was 52 years old. He already had experience with polymers from his previous business ventures. In 1980, he bought an injection-moulding machine to manufacture handles and sheaths for the field knives he was making for the Austrian army in his garage workshop. His earliest employees were from the camera industry and experienced in producing polymer components. His first production pistol was the Glock 17. It took one year to design and produce, and he applied for its Austrian patent in April 1981.

Robert McFadden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Glock&#x27;s pistol:
==Murder attempt==
In July 1999, Glock suspected that Charles Ewert, one of his closest financial advisers, had been embezzling funds. Glock confronted Ewert, who hired a French mercenary to murder Glock with a rubber mallet in a car park in an attempt to make it look like an accident. Glock was hit in the head, but was able to fight back, punching the man until he collapsed on top of Glock. Both Ewert and the assassin were convicted of attempted murder and sent to prison.

==Personal life==
Glock married Helga Glock in 1958 and they co-founded the family business in 1963. The Glocks had three children, Brigitte, Gaston Jr., and Robert. They divorced in 2011 and entered litigation over accusations that Glock engaged in racketeering. Glock married his second wife, Kathrin Tschikof, that same year. She is a nurse who is 50 years younger and had treated him for a stroke in 2008. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2017.

Glock donated over €1 million to Austrian charities. He also gave funds to the Freedom Party of Austria. Glock was described as a &quot;reclusive Austrian billionaire&quot; who avoided publicity and valued his privacy despite his famous invention.

Glock died on 27 December 2023, at the age of 94.

<doc id="1034214" wikidata="Q159196" url="?curid=1034214" title="Hitler cabinet">
<text>The Hitler cabinet was the government of Nazi Germany between 30 January 1933 and 30 April 1945 upon the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg. It was contrived by the national conservative politician Franz von Papen, who reserved the office of the Vice-Chancellor for himself. Originally, Hitler&#x27;s first cabinet was called the Reich Cabinet of National Salvation, which was a coalition of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and the national conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). The Hitler cabinet lasted until his suicide during the defeat of Nazi Germany. Hitler&#x27;s cabinet was succeeded by the short-lived Goebbels cabinet, with Karl Dönitz appointed by Hitler as the new &quot;Reichspräsident&quot;.

==History==
In brokering the appointment of Hitler as Reich Chancellor, Papen had sought to control Hitler by limiting the number of Nazi ministers in the cabinet; initially Hermann Göring (without portfolio) and Wilhelm Frick (Interior) were the only Nazi ministers. Further, Alfred Hugenberg, the head of the DNVP, was enticed into joining the cabinet by being given the Economic and Agricultural portfolios for both the Reich and Prussia, with the expectation that Hugenberg would be a counterweight to Hitler and would be useful in controlling him. Of the other significant ministers in the initial cabinet, Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath was a holdover from the previous administration, as were Finance Minister Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, Post and Transport Minister Paul Freiherr von Eltz-Rübenach, and Justice Minister Franz Gürtner.

The cabinet was &quot;presidential&quot; and not &quot;parliamentary&quot;, in that it governed on the basis of emergency powers granted to the President in Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution rather than through a majority vote in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. This had been the basis for Weimar cabinets since Hindenburg&#x27;s appointment of Heinrich Brüning as Chancellor in March 1930. Hindenburg specifically wanted a cabinet of the nationalist right, without participation by the Catholic Centre Party or the Social Democratic Party, which had been the mainstays of earlier parliamentary cabinets. Hindenburg turned to Papen, a former Chancellor himself, to bring such a body together, but blanched at appointing Hitler as Chancellor. Papen was certain that Hitler and the Nazi Party had to be included, but Hitler had previously turned down the position of Vice Chancellor. So Papen, with the help of Hindenburg&#x27;s son Oskar, persuaded Hindenburg to appoint Hitler Chancellor.

Initially, the Hitler cabinet, like its immediate predecessors, ruled through Presidential decrees written by the cabinet and signed by Hindenburg. However, the Enabling Act of 1933, passed two months after Hitler took office, gave the cabinet the power to make laws without legislative consent or Hindenburg&#x27;s signature. In effect, the power to rule by decree was vested in Hitler, and for all intents and purposes it made him a dictator. After the Enabling Act&#x27;s passage, serious deliberations more or less ended at cabinet meetings. It met only sporadically after 1934, and last met in full on 5 February 1938.

When Hitler came to power, the cabinet consisted of the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor and the heads of 10 Reich Ministries. Between 1933 and 1941 six new &quot;Reichsministries&quot; were established, but the War Ministry was abolished and replaced by the OKW. The cabinet was further enlarged by the addition of several &quot;Reichsministers&quot; without Portfolio and by other officials, such as the commanders-in-chief of the armed services, who were granted the rank and authority of &quot;Reichsministers&quot; but without the title. In addition, various officials – though not formally &quot;Reichsministers&quot; – such as Reich Youth Leader Baldur von Schirach, Prussian Finance Minister Johannes Popitz, and Chief of the Organisation for Germans Abroad, Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, were authorised to participate in Reich cabinet meetings when issues within their area of jurisdiction were under discussion.
As the Nazis consolidated political power, other parties were outlawed or dissolved themselves. Of the three original DNVP ministers, Franz Seldte joined the Nazi Party in April 1933, Hugenberg departed the cabinet in June when the DNVP was dissolved and Gürtner stayed on without a party designation. There were originally several other independent politicians in the cabinet, mainly holdovers from previous governments. Gereke was the first of these to be dismissed when he was arrested for embezzlement on 23 March 1933. Papen was then dismissed in early August 1934. Then, on 30 January 1937, Hitler presented the Golden Party Badge to all remaining non-Nazi members of the cabinet (Blomberg, Eltz-Rübenach, Fritsch, Gürtner, Neurath, Raeder &amp; Schacht) and enrolled them in the Party. Only Eltz-Rübenach, a devout Roman Catholic, refused and resigned. Similarly, on 20 April 1939, Brauchitsh and Keitel were presented with the Golden Party Badge. Dorpmüller received it in December 1940 and formally joined the Party on 1 February 1941. Dönitz followed on 30 January 1944. Thus, no independent politicians or military leaders were left in the cabinet.

The actual power of the cabinet as a body was minimised when it stopped meeting in person and decrees were worked out between the ministries by sharing and marking-up draft proposals, which only went to Hitler for rejection, revision or signing when that process was completed. The cabinet was also overshadowed by the numerous &quot;ad hoc&quot; agencies – both of the state and of the Nazi Party – such as Supreme Reich Authorities and plenipotentiaries – that Hitler caused to be created to deal with specific problems and situations. Individual ministers, however, especially Göring, Goebbels, Himmler, Speer, and Bormann, held extensive power, at least until, in the case of Göring and Speer, Hitler came to distrust them.

By the final years of World War II, Bormann had emerged as the most powerful minister, not because he was head of the Party Chancellery, which was the basis of his position in the cabinet, but because of his control of access to Hitler in his role as Secretary to the &quot;Führer&quot;.

==End of cabinet==
The last meeting of Hitler&#x27;s cabinet took place on 5 February 1938. As the Nazi government was disintegrating at the end of the Second World War and following Hitler&#x27;s death on 30 April 1945, it was succeeded by the short-lived Goebbels Cabinet, which was itself replaced on 2 May by the Cabinet of Schwerin von Krosigk commonly known as the Flensburg Government.

==Postwar indictment and result of prosecutions==
As part of the &quot;Reichsregierung&quot; (Reich Government) the Reich Cabinet was indicted as a criminal organisation by the International Military Tribunal. It was ultimately adjudged at the conclusion of the Nuremberg trials not to be a criminal organisation.
With regard to the individual members, by the fall of the Nazi regime in May 1945 five members of the Reich Cabinet had committed suicide (Hitler, Bormann, Himmler, Goebbels, &amp; Rust). Six others had already died (von Eltz-Rübenach, von Fritsch, Gürtner, Kerrl, Röhm, &amp; Todt). However, 15 surviving members of the Cabinet were individually indicted and tried for war crimes by the IMT along with Martin Bormann who was tried in absentia as he was thought to be still alive. Eight were sentenced to death (Bormann, Hans Frank, Frick, Göring, Keitel, von Ribbentrop, Rosenberg, &amp; Seyss-Inquart) six were imprisoned (Dönitz, Funk, Hess, von Neurath, Raeder, &amp; Speer) and two (Schacht &amp; von Papen) were acquitted.

An additional four Cabinet members (Darré, Lammers, Meissner, &amp; Schwerin von Krosigk) were tried by a US military court in the subsequent Ministries Trial; all but Meissner were convicted and imprisoned. One (Schlegelberger) was tried in the Judges&#x27; Trial and imprisoned. One (Karl Hermann Frank) was tried by a Czech court and sentenced to death. Another five (Backe, von Blomberg, von Brauchitsch, Seldte, &amp; Thierack) died in Allied custody before being brought to trial. Finally, the remaining cabinet members, including some of those acquitted in the Allied trials, were brought before special German denazification courts which categorised their level of guilt and determined whether punishment was warranted. Among those convicted under this process were Hierl, von Papen, and Schacht.

<text>The Kool-Aid Man (sometimes referred to as the Kool-Aid Guy or Captain Kool-Aid or Big Thirst) is the official mascot for Kool-Aid, a brand of flavored drink mix. The character has appeared on television and in print advertising as a fun-loving, gigantic, and joyful anthropomorphic pitcher filled with the original flavor of Kool-Aid which was Cherry Kool-Aid. He is typically featured answering the call of children by smashing through walls or furnishings and then holding a pitcher filled with Kool-Aid while saying his catchphrase, &quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; He had a comic series produced by Marvel Entertainment where he fought villains known as &quot;Thirsties&quot; and even fought a man engulfed in fire named Scorch. He can also come in many different colors such as red, blue, green, and purple.

==History==

The precursor to Kool-Aid Man, &quot;the Pitcher Man&quot;, was created on July 10, 1954. Marvin Potts, an art director for a New York advertising agency, was hired by General Foods to create an image that would accompany the slogan &quot;A 5-cent package makes two quarts&quot;. Inspired by watching his young son draw smiley faces on a frosted window, Potts created the Pitcher Man, a glass pitcher with a wide smile emblazoned on its side and filled with Kool-Aid. It was one of several designs he created, but the only one that stuck, and General Foods began to use the Pitcher Man in all of its advertisements. The character&#x27;s face was sometimes animated in synchronization with the jingle.

In 1974, arms and legs were added and Kool-Aid Man was introduced as a 6-foot-tall pitcher of cherry Kool-Aid, reportedly voiced by Grey Advertising composer Richard Berg and created by Alan Kupchick and Harold Karp (of Grey Advertising). Children, parched from playing, or other various activities, typically exchanged a few words referring to their thirst, then put a hand to the side of their mouths and shouted &quot;Hey, Kool-Aid!&quot;, whereupon Kool-Aid Man made his grand entrance, breaking through walls, fences, ceilings, or furnishings, uttering the famous words &quot;Oh, yeah!&quot;, then poured the dehydrated youngsters a glass of Kool-Aid. In 1979, the character&#x27;s mouth was again animated to move in synchronization with the voice actor&#x27;s singing and/or dialogue.

From at least 1979 to 1981, the character was known in Canada as Captain Kool-Aid.

By the 1980s, Kool-Aid Man had attained pop-culture icon status, and in 1983, was the subject of two video games for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision systems. He was also given his own short-lived comic book series (prior to that, he starred in a two-issue series published by the General Foods Corporation in 1975) called &quot;The Adventures of Kool-Aid Man&quot;. It ran for three issues under Marvel Comics from 1983 to 1985 and continued with issues #4-9 under Archie Comics, with art by Dan DeCarlo, from 1987 to 1990. It featured the Thirsties, a group of anthropomorphic sun-like creatures, as villains.

In 1994, the live-action character was retired, and from then until 2008, the character became entirely computer-generated, but other characters, such as the children, remained live-action. In 1999, singer and voice actor Frank Simms began voicing the character. In 2009, the live-action character returned, playing street basketball and battling &quot;Cola&quot; to stay balanced on a log, where he was voiced by Pat Duke. Keith Hudson also briefly voiced the character in several Kraft Foods commercials. In 2015, the character was voiced by Scott Golden. In 2016, Brock Powell took over the role for Kool-Aid&#x27;s major rebranding, including collaborations with Progressive automotive and Nickelodeon and voiced the character for several digital campaigns until officially &quot;passing the pitcher&quot; in 2019. In 2020, Matt Howell began voicing the character.

== In popular culture ==

American artist David Hammons used Kool-Aid and incorporated a stamp of the Kool-Aid Man for a piece that hung in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

The Kool-Aid Man is a playable character in &quot;Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff&quot;.

In May 2016, the Kool-Aid Man appeared in a television commercial for the American insurance company Progressive, voiced again by Brock Powell.

In December 2018, the Kool-Aid Man appeared with rapper Lil Jon in his Christmas song &quot;All I Really Want for Christmas&quot;. As of April 2024, the video has more than million views. Critical reception was positive. Fast Company called it &quot;epic and bonkers&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said: &quot;Lil Jon has given us all a true gift&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; named it &quot;the greatest Christmas song of all time&quot;. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;you have to see this&quot;.

In a Super Bowl LIV TV ad in 2020, Kool-Aid Man, alongside Mr. Clean, appeared in a commercial for fellow Kraft Heinz product Planters, shown as an attendee of the funeral of Mr. Peanut. His tears end up causing a new, baby Mr. Peanut to grow from the ground.

In January 2024, Bring Me the Horizon released the single &quot;Kool-Aid&quot;. An edited depiction of the Kool-Aid man appears as the cover art for the single.

In February 2025, Instacart had a commercial played at Super Bowl LIX that featured the Kool-Aid man and other mascots such as Mr. Clean, Chester Cheetah, Pillsbury Doughboy and more running to a house which later at the end being turned into the mascots products.

==Reception==
&quot;Time&quot; magazine included the Kool-Aid Man on a list of the &quot;Top 10 Creepiest Product Mascots&quot;, saying: &quot;Our biggest gripe with Kool-Aid Man: Why did he have to cause such a mess every time he entered the scene?&quot;

<text>Poppin&#x27; Fresh, more widely known as the Pillsbury Doughboy, is an advertising mascot for the Pillsbury Company, appearing in many of their commercials. Many commercials from 1965 until 2005 (together with some for GEICO between 2009 and 2017) ended with a human finger poking the Doughboy&#x27;s belly. The Doughboy responds by giggling when his belly is poked (&quot;Hoo-Hoo&quot;!, or earlier on, a slight giggle &quot;tee hee&quot;).

== History ==
The Pillsbury Doughboy was created by Rudolph &#x27;Rudy&#x27; Perz, a copywriter for Pillsbury&#x27;s longtime advertising agency Leo Burnett. Perz was sitting in his kitchen in the spring of 1965, under pressure to create an advertising campaign for Pillsbury&#x27;s refrigerated dough product line (biscuits, dinner rolls, sweet rolls, and cookies). His copywriter, Carol H. Williams, imagined a living doughboy popping out of a Pillsbury refrigerated dough can and wrote the campaign, &quot;Say Hello to Poppin&#x27; Fresh Dough&quot;. Williams was inducted into the American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Character==
Poppin&#x27; Fresh was given a scarf, a chef&#x27;s hat, and two big blue eyes to distinguish him from the rolls, as well as a faint blush and a soft, warm chuckle when poked on the belly. The Doughboy was originally designed by Milt Schaffer.

Stop-motion animator Jim Danforth was hired to animate him. The first Poppin&#x27; Fresh commercials aired in November 1965. Since then, Pillsbury has used Poppin&#x27; Fresh in more than 600 commercials for more than fifty of its products. He also appeared in a MasterCard&#x27;s &quot;Icons&quot; commercial in 2005 during Super Bowl XXXIX, with the Jolly Green Giant, the Morton Salt Girl, the Vlasic stork, Charlie the Tuna, Mr. Peanut, Count Chocula, the Gorton&#x27;s Fisherman, Chef Boyardee, and Mr. Clean as some of the ten merchandising icons, depicted as having dinner together. He even appears in ads for the Got Milk? company and the Sprint Phone Company, and the GEICO insurance company. He also made a cameo appearance in the 1987 animation film &quot;The Puppetoon Movie&quot;. On February 9, 2025 during Super Bowl LIX, he appeared in a ad for Instacart alongside the aforementioned Jolly Green Giant and Mr. Clean, Kool-Aid Man, Isaiah Mustafa (The &quot;Old Spice Guy&quot;), Chester Cheetah (Cheetos), the Energizer Bunny, Mountain Dew&#x27;s PuppyMonkeyBaby, and the Heinz Wiener Dogs.

===Voice actors===
Over 50 different actors auditioned for the role of the Pillsbury Doughboy, among them was Paul Winchell, who is best known for voicing Tigger in the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; franchise, but lost out.

Paul Frees was the first actor chosen to be Fresh&#x27;s voice and would continue to provide his voice for 21 years. After Frees&#x27; death in 1986, Jeff Bergman took over the role, until 2014. The high-pitched giggles were done by JoBe Cerny after 2014. In recent years, he has also been voiced by Peter New, Fred Young, and Jeremy Geller. In two advertisements for the UK in 1976, British voice actor Peter Hawkins voiced the character.

==Animation==
Perz originally conceived the Doughboy as a cartoon animated figure but changed his mind after seeing a stop-motion technique used in the opening credits for &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot;. Cascade Pictures was hired to create a three-dimensional Doughboy puppet at a cost of $16,000.

The Doughboy was brought to life with stop-motion animation, using foam rubber puppets with ball and socket armatures inside for the body. The heads were typically made of resin, each with different mouth shapes or expression and animated using a replacement animation technique whereby the head would be swapped out frame-by-frame to match the mouth movements to the dialog. Beginning in 1992, the animation technique was changed to CGI animation, and continues to be used in new ads.

==Pillsbury family==
In the 1970s, a Pillsbury Doughboy family was created and sold as dolls individually and in the form of various playsets.

Included in the family are:
*Poppin&#x27; Fresh
*Poppie Fresh (a.k.a. Mrs. Poppin&#x27; Fresh, Pillsbury Doughgirl). It is debated among collectors as to whether Poppie is Poppin&#x27;s wife, girlfriend, or sister.
*Granpopper and Granmommer (grandparents)
*Popper (boy) and Bun-Bun (baby, girl)
*Flapjack (dog) and Biscuit (cat)
*Uncle Rollie

==Trademark conflict==
In May 2010, Pillsbury&#x27;s lawyers served a cease and desist notice to My Dough Girl, LLC., a Salt Lake City, Utah cookie retailer. Some reported that an attorney for General Mills instructed her not to talk to the press.

<text>A missing person is a person who has disappeared and whose status as alive or dead cannot be confirmed as their location and condition are unknown. A person may go missing through a voluntary disappearance, or else due to an accident, crime, or death in a location where they cannot be found (such as at sea), or many other reasons. In most parts of the world, a missing person will usually be found quickly. Criminal abductions are some of the most widely reported missing person cases.

By contrast, some missing person cases remain unresolved for many years. Laws related to these cases are often complex since, in many jurisdictions, relatives and third parties may not deal with a person&#x27;s assets until their death is considered proven by law and a formal death certificate issued. The situation, uncertainties, and lack of closure or a funeral resulting when a person goes missing may be extremely painful with long-lasting effects on family and friends.

A number of organizations seek to connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations, including the International Commission on Missing Persons, the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), as well as national organizations, including the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children in the US, Missing People in the UK, Child Focus in Belgium, and The Smile of the Child in Greece.

== Reasons ==
People disappear for many reasons. Some individuals choose to disappear, for others disappearance is inadvertent (e.g. getting lost) or it is imposed on them (abduction/imprisonment). Reasons for disappearance may include:

* To escape domestic abuse.
* Leaving home to live in an unknown place under a new identity.
* Becoming the victim of kidnapping.
* Child abduction by a non-custodial parent or other relative.
* Seizure by the federal authorities (Military, law enforcement, government) and imprisoned / detained indefinitely / tortured fatally / non fatally for an unknown period of time in an undisclosed guarded location without due process of law (see forced disappearance).
* Suicide in a remote location or under an assumed name (generally to spare their families the suicide at home or to allow their deaths to be eventually declared &quot;in absentia&quot;).
* Victim of murder (body disguised, destroyed, or hidden).
* Mental illness or other ailments such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease can cause people to forget where or who they are.
* Death by natural causes (disease) or accident far from home without identification.
* Becoming lost accidentally in remote areas, including when participating in outdoor recreation or labour (hiking, mountaineering, hunting, etc.)
* Disappearance to take advantage of better employment or living conditions elsewhere.
* Sold into slavery, serfdom, sexual servitude, or other unfree labor.
* To avoid discovery of a crime or apprehension by law-enforcement authorities, (&quot;See also&quot; failure to appear.) and punishment after committing a such crime (murder, theft, rape, terrorism, fraud, etc.).
* Joining a cult or other religious organization that requires no contact to the outside world.
* To avoid war or persecution during a genocide.
* As a consequence of war – e.g. missing in action, impressment, collateral damage
* To escape famine or natural disaster.
* Death by floods, flash floods, debris flows, hurricanes, tsunamis and tornadoes.
* Death in the water, with no body recovered.
* Aviation accident where no wreckage is found or ship wreck where no wreckage is found
* Desertion during war or absent without leave (AWOL).
* To avoid conscription.
* Hostage.
* To avoid paying someone or something.

== Categories of missing children ==
* Runaways: Minors who run away from home, from the institution where they have been placed, or from the people responsible for their care.
*Thrownaways: Minors who are abandoned by their parents or guardians.
* Parental abduction: Minors who are abducted by their parents or guardians for unknown reasons.

*Non-parental abduction: Minors who are abducted by non-parental means. (e.g. random kidnapping on streets by random people.)
* Missing unaccompanied migrant minors: Disappearances of migrant children, nationals of a country in which there is no free movement of persons, under the age of 18 who have been separated from both parents and are not being cared for by an adult, who by law is responsible for doing so.
* Lost, injured or otherwise missing children: Disappearances for no apparent reason of minors who got lost (e.g., young children at the seaside in summer) or hurt themselves and cannot be found immediately (e.g. accidents during sport activities, at youth camps, etc.), as well as children whose reason for disappearing has not yet been determined or found.

== Legal aspects ==
A common misconception is that a person must be absent for at least 24 hours before being legally classed as missing, but this is rarely the case. Law enforcement agencies often stress that the case should be reported as early as possible. In fact, it is extremely crucial to report a missing person as soon as possible. This is in order to take immediate action in the vital first 48 hours after a person is declared missing. In these 48 hours, the police will be able to interview any eyewitness and get any suspect descriptions while it is still fresh in their minds. In most common law jurisdictions, a missing person can be declared dead &quot;in absentia&quot; (or &quot;legally dead&quot;) after seven years. This time frame may be reduced in certain cases.

==Searches==
In most countries, the police are the default agency for leading an investigation into a missing person case. Disappearances at sea are a general exception, as these require a specialized agency such as a coast guard. In many countries, such as the United States, voluntary search and rescue teams can be called out to assist the police in the search. Rescue agencies such as fire departments, mountain rescue and cave rescue may also participate in cases that require their specialized resources. Police forces such as Lancashire Constabulary stress the need to try to find the person quickly, to assess how vulnerable the person is, and to search places that the person may have links to.

Various charities exist to assist the investigations into unsolved cases. These include the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children in the US, Missing People in the UK, Child Focus in Belgium, and The Smile of the Child in Greece. Some missing person cases are given wide media coverage, with the searchers turning to the public for assistance. The persons&#x27; photographs may be displayed on bulletin boards, milk cartons, postcards, websites and social media to publicize their description.
==Media coverage==

=== Ethnicity and socioeconomic status ===
A racial disparity between the American news media response when a white individual goes missing and when a black individual goes missing has been observed. According to Seong-Jae Min &amp; John C. Feaster, throughout history the news media has provided white individuals, particularly affluent women, more comprehensive news coverage than people of color. The authors have noted that while a correlation has been established, they have no clear causation. They suggest that the socioeconomic status or attractiveness of a child may also influence their chances of appearing in the news media.

American journalist Howard Kurtz, best known for his analysis of the media, supported the conclusion that a person&#x27;s race and socioeconomic status impacted media coverage. He gave the kidnappings of Elizabeth Smart and Alexis Patterson as an example—when Smart, a young affluent Caucasian girl from Utah, went missing, the media coverage was worldwide. After several months of searching, she was found alive. In comparison, when Patterson, a young black girl from Wisconsin, went missing, she received only local news coverage and is still missing to this day.

Within the U.S., there are several organizations that bring awareness and equality to missing people of color, such as the Black and Missing Foundation, a non-profit organization founded in 2008. The Black and Missing Foundation&#x27;s goal is to provide resources to families of missing people of color and educate minority groups on personal safety. Additionally, Deidra Robey leads a non-profit organization called Black and Missing but not Forgotten, which provides assistance in spreading awareness about a missing person.

It has also been speculated by Kristen Gilchrist that, in Canadian news media, Aboriginal women receive three and a half times less coverage than white women. Their articles were found to be shorter and less detailed—with an average word count for white women of 713 compared to 518 for Aboriginal women—and less likely to be front-page news. Depictions of the Aboriginals were also described by Gilchrist as more &quot;detached&quot; in tone.

=== Emphasis on stranger kidnappings ===
Some of the most widely covered missing person cases have been kidnappings of children by strangers; however these instances are rare. In most parts of the world, criminal abductions make up only a small percentage of missing person cases and, in turn, most of these abductions are by someone who knows the child (such as a non-custodial parent). A child staying too long with a non-custodial parent can be enough to qualify as an abduction. During the year 1999 in the United States, there were an estimated 800,000 reported missing children cases. Of these, 203,900 children were reported as the victims of family abductions and 58,200 of non-family abductions. However, only 115 were the result of &quot;stereotypical&quot; kidnaps (by someone unknown or of slight acquaintance to the child, taking them a long distance with intent to murder or to hold them permanently or for ransom).

== International statistics and efforts ==
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in 2012 that: &quot;It is estimated that some 8 million children go missing around the world each year.&quot; The BBC News reported that of the children who go missing worldwide, &quot;while usually the child is found quickly the ordeal can sometimes last months, even years.&quot; The issue of child disappearances is increasingly recognized as a concern for national and international policy makers especially in cross border abduction cases, organized child trafficking and child pornography as well as the transient nature of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum.

According to the UNHCR, over 15,000 unaccompanied and separated children claimed asylum in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland in 2009. The precarious situation of these children makes them particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses, rendering their protection critical, given the high risks to which they are exposed. Most of these children are boys aged 14 years and over, with diverse ethnic, cultural, religious and social backgrounds mainly originating from Afghanistan, Somalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea and Iraq.

Among exploiters taking advantage of the children, are sometimes their own relatives who gain benefit in the form of social or family allowances. According to research done by Frontex, some types of threats faced by unaccompanied migrant minors include sexual exploitation in terms of pornography, prostitution and the internet; economic exploitation including forced donation of organs; criminal exploitation including drug smuggling and child trafficking including forced marriage and begging.

Criminal networks are heavily involved with human trafficking to the EU and this includes also exploitation of minors as manpower in the sex trade and other criminal activities. According to a 2007 UNICEF report on Child Trafficking in Europe, 2 million children are being trafficked in Europe every year. Child trafficking occurs in virtually all countries in Europe. There is no clear-cut distinction between countries of origin and destination in Europe. Trafficking in children has been perceived mainly in connection with sexual exploitation, but the reality is much more complex. Children in Europe are also trafficked for exploitation through labor, domestic servitude, begging, criminal activities and other exploitative purposes.
In the report, UNICEF also warns that there is a dramatic absence of harmonized and systematic data collection, analysis and dissemination at all levels without which countries lack important evidence that informs national policies and responses. Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing children, aims to meet this need. The CRM system is expected to have a clear impact on the way hotlines are able to work together and collect data on the problem of missing children.

The British Asylum Screening Unit estimated that 60% of the unaccompanied minors accommodated in social care centres in the UK go missing and are not found again. In the UK these open centres, from where minors are able to call their traffickers, act as &#x27;human markets&#x27; for the facilitators and traffickers who generally collect their prey within 24 hours of arrival in the UK. According to the CIA out of the 800,000 people trafficked annually across national borders in the world, up to 50% are minors.

The United Nations is operating a Commission on Missing Persons that serves as an international coordination center and provides also statistical material regarding missing persons worldwide. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement strives to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons when loss of contact is due to armed conflict or other situations of violence; natural or man-made disaster; migration and in other situations of humanitarian need. It is also supporting the families of missing persons to rebuild their social lives and find emotional well-being.

== Laws and statistics by country ==
===Austria===
Austria has a competence center for missing persons. The police records the missing person&#x27;s data, which is stored in the Austrian Search System (EKIS) and (automatically) in the Schengen Information System (SIS). In 2016, a total of 8,887 cases were processed and stored in the EKIS. Of these, 6,322 cases involved EU citizens, except for 44 resolved, and 2,565 non-EU citizens, except for 264 resolved. As of October 1, 2017, a total of 1,300 people were reported missing in Austria: 349 were women, 198 of whom were minors; 951 were male, of whom 597 were minors. The number of EU citizens who were stored in the EKIS as missing was between 400 and 500 at all times mentioned in 2015 to 2017. In 2017, 10,000 missing person reports were filed in Austria. As of May 1, 2018, 1,267 people had been reported missing, including 746 children and young people. Only 505 came from EU countries.

In January 2019, 1037 people were recorded as missing in the EKIS, in January 2020 884 people. Between 2016 and 2019, 85 percent of missing persons cases were resolved within a week, 95 percent within a month, 97 percent within six months and 98 percent within a year. In 2019, the KAP published a search in only 13 cases, the result of which was: eight alive, three dead, two still missing. The legal status of missing persons in Austria is regulated by the Declaration of Death Act (&quot;Todeserklärungsgesetz&quot;).

===Australia===
Over 305,000 people were reported missing in Australia from 2008 to 2015, which is estimated to be one person reported missing every 18 minutes. Around 38,159 missing person reports are made on average every year in Australia.

=== Canada ===
Royal Canadian Mounted Police missing child statistics for a ten-year period show a total of 60,582 missing children in 2007.

===France===
The file named &quot;Fichier des personnes recherchées&quot; (FPR) is a data collection of the French national police. It is also under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence.

=== Ireland ===
On May 26, 2002, a monument to missing persons was unveiled in County Kilkenny, Ireland by President Mary McAleese. It was the first monument of its kind in the world.

===Jamaica===
The founder of Jamaica&#x27;s Hear the Children&#x27;s Cry, child-rights advocate Betty Ann Blaine, asked the government to introduce missing-children legislation in Jamaica. She said in May 2015: &quot;Jamaica is facing a crisis of missing children. Every single month, we have approximately 150 reports of children who go missing. That is a crisis because we are only 2.7 million people.&quot; She said her organization would work with the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC) to recommend a model law to the Parliament of Jamaica.

===Japan===
It has been estimated that 100,000 Japanese people disappear annually. The term jouhatsu refers to the people in Japan who purposely vanish from their established lives without a trace.

===Latin America===
In the 1970s and 1980s, almost all South American countries were ruled for a long time by right-wing military dictatorships. Most of them violently suppressed the opposition, usually with the secret kidnapping of unwanted people by unnamed members of the security forces.

While the families reported the disappearances, the victims were unjustly imprisoned, tortured and finally killed. In Argentina, they were loaded onto a plane and thrown into the sea. During the Argentina&#x27;s military dictatorship (1976–1983), almost 30,000 people disappeared in this way, permanently and without leaving any trace.

===Russia===
According to a report by the Russian news agency TASS released in 2018, between 70,000 and 100,000 people go missing in Russia every year. About 25% of missing persons cases remain unsolved.

===Switzerland===
The cantonal police are responsible for reports of disappearances, which do not have specialized sections on the matter. The complaint can be filed one year after an event that can be linked to a danger to life or five years after the last sign of life of the interested person. If the person found by the authorities is of age, they can only inform other people with her consent.

Police search and emergency room costs are usually charged in part or in full to the applicants. Helicopter searches are particularly expensive. The insurance covers the costs if the situation was not caused by gross negligence, if there is a risk of death and if there is a reasonable chance of survival.

A relatively large number of people are lost in Switzerland due to accidents in alpine sports. In the event of melting glaciers, the police have issued instructions on how to deal with the bodies: photograph the finds, mark them, write down the coordinates and, if there is a risk that the finds or their location may not be found a second time, they must be picked up and delivered to the nearest police station.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; reported in 2012, over 140,000 children go missing each year, as calculated by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) of the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Crime Agency.

=== United States ===
Statistical information on missing persons in the US is provided by annual National Crime Information Center (NCIC) &quot;Missing Person and Unidentified Person Statistics&quot;, annual AMBER Alert Reports (minors only) and a comprehensive 2002 NISMART–2 study (covering children missing in year 1999). AMBER Alerts are reserved for confirmed abductions, where the child is at risk of serious injury or death. In 2018, 161 such alerts were issued, concerning 203 children. Of those 161 cases, 23 were found to be hoaxes or unfounded (minor was not missing), 92 were familial abductions, 38 were non-familial abductions and remaining 8 were runaways, lost, injured or unclassified. As of early 2019, 11 children were still missing and 7 were found deceased, with remaining children having been recovered. Notably, even though all states have operational AMBER program, 16 did not issue any alerts in 2018.

National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children (NISMART–2) study by the U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention from 2002 comprehensively described missing children cases for year 1999. The study considered a child missing when the child&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown to the primary caretaker, with the result that the caretaker was alarmed for at least 1 hour and tried to locate the child. The estimated number of &quot;caretaker missing children (reported and not reported)&quot; was around 1.3 million, with about 800 thousand missing children estimated to have been reported. The 1,300,000 number is further broken down into approximately 33,000 non-familial abductions, 117,000 familial abductions, 629,000 runaway/thrownaway cases, 198,000 lost/injured, and 375,000 &quot;benign explanations&quot;. By the time the study data were collected, 99.8% of 1.3 million caretaker missing children had been returned home alive or located. Only 0.2% percent or 2,500 had not, the vast majority of which were runaways from institutions. Furthermore, only an estimated 115 of 33,000 non-familial abductions were stereotypical kidnappings, involving a stranger or slight acquaintance, who holds the child for ransom, abducts with intent to kill or keep permanently. Data in the study was derived from a Law Enforcement Study, National Household Surveys of both Adult Caretakers and Youth (telephone interviews) and a Juvenile Facilities Study. The estimated number of 800,000 missing children reports has been widely circulated in the popular press.

The United States&#x27; National Crime Information Center (NCIC) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, mandated by the National Child Search Assistance Act, maintains its own &quot;Missing Person File&quot; to which local police report people for whom they are searching. The NCIC &quot;Missing Person File&quot; does have a category that is entitled &quot;Juvenile&quot; or &quot;EMJ&quot; (for: Enter Missing Person – Juvenile), but that category does not reflect the total number of all juveniles reported missing to the NCIC, for whom local police are searching. The NCIC also uses its own classification criteria; it does not use the above NISMART definitions of what constitutes a missing child. The NCIC data is limited to individuals who have been reported to the NCIC as missing, and are being searched for, by local police. In addition, the EMJ category does not contain all reports of juveniles who have been reported missing to the NCIC. 

While the EMJ category holds records of some of the juveniles reported missing, the totals for the EMJ category excludes those juveniles recorded missing &quot;but&quot; who &quot;have a proven physical or mental disability ... are missing under circumstances indicating that they may be in physical danger ... are missing after a catastrophe ... [or] are missing under circumstances indicating their disappearance may not have been voluntary&quot;. In 2013, the NCIC entered 445,214 &quot;EMJ&quot; reports (440,625 in the EMJ category under the age of 18; but 462,567 under the age of 18 in all categories, and 494,372 under the age of 21 in all categories), and NCIC&#x27;s total reports numbered 627,911. 

Of the children under age 18, a total of 4,883 reports were classified as &quot;missing under circumstances indicating that the disappearance may not have been voluntary, i.e., abduction or kidnapping&quot; (9,572 under age 21), and an additional 9,617 as &quot;missing under circumstances indicating that his/her physical safety may be in danger&quot; (15,163 under age 21). The total missing person records entered into NCIC were 661,593 in 2012, 678,860 in 2011 (550,424 of whom were under 21), 692,944 in 2010 (531,928 of whom were under 18, and 565,692 of whom were under 21), and 719,558 in 2009. A total of 630,990 records were cleared or canceled during 2013. At end-of-year 2013, NCIC had 84,136 still-active missing person records, with 33,849 (40.2%) being of juveniles under 18, and 9,706 (11.5%) being of juveniles between 18 and 20.

=== European Union ===
116 000 is the European hotline for missing children active in all 27 countries of the EU as well as Albania, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The hotline was an initiative pushed for by Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing and sexually exploited children. The Council of Europe estimates that about one in five children in Europe are victims of some form of sexual violence. In 70% to 85% of cases, the abuser is somebody the child knows and trusts. Child sexual violence can take many forms: sexual abuse within the family circle, child pornography and prostitution, corruption, solicitation via Internet and sexual assault by peers. In some of the cases, with no other available option, children flee their homes and care institutions, in search of a better and safer life.

Of the 50–60% of child runaways reported by the 116 000 European missing children hotline network, one in six are assumed to rough sleep on the run, one in eight resort to stealing to survive and one in four children are at serious risk of some form of abuse. The number of rough sleeping children across Europe is on the rise. These runaways fall into vulnerable situations of sexual abuse, alcohol abuse and drug abuse leading to depression. Runaways are 9 times likelier to have suicidal tendencies than other children. The Children&#x27;s Society published a report in 2011 on recommendations to the government to keep child runaways safe.

<doc id="1034226" wikidata="Q642975" url="?curid=1034226" title="Elite Ice Hockey League">
<text>The Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL), sometimes referred to internationally as the British Elite League, is an ice hockey league in the United Kingdom. Formed in 2003 following the demise of the Ice Hockey Superleague, it is the highest level of ice hockey competition in the United Kingdom.

The league operates three competitions for members; the British Championship play-offs determine the national champion for the season, following a regular season league competition for which separate champions are also crowned, and which selects and seeds the teams in the play-offs. Finally, a stand-alone cup competition, the Challenge Cup, is also held annually including only EIHL teams, beginning with the group stages followed by a knock-out format. In effect, the play-off final, regular end-of-season table and Challenge Cup final crown the British or National Champions, the EIHL League champions and the Cup champions respectively.

The league currently consists of one division of ten teams, with representation from all four nations of the United Kingdom – the only league in any sport to do so. Five of the teams as of 2025 are situated in England, while the other five are spread throughout the other nations; three in Scotland, one each in Wales and Northern Ireland. In twenty completed seasons the league championship has been won by five different teams, while the play-offs have crowned six different teams as national champions.

A system of promotion and relegation is not operated by the Elite League; teams enter the league on the basis of a decision by the board of directors. A similar system operates in most American sports, and also in various competitions in Britain and Ireland, including Britain&#x27;s Super League Basketball competitions, the United Rugby Championship, Celtic Challenge women&#x27;s rugby union competition, the Netball Superleague, and both The Hundred and County Championship in English and Welsh cricket. In comparison, the English football league system and English rugby union league system operate promotion and relegation, while the English rugby league system operates a hybrid model as of 2025.

Despite the closed franchise system, other organised ice-hockey does take place in Great Britain. The level below the Elite League is the National Ice Hockey League, and historically teams have moved between the two leagues by election for competitive and financial reasons, by agreement of the respective leagues&#x27; management.

Internationally, teams from the EIHL can participate in the International Ice Hockey Federation&#x27;s annual Champions Hockey League (CHL), competing for the European Trophy. Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the European/Asian Kontinental Hockey League). Going into the 2022–23 CHL season, the EIHL was ranked the No. 8 league in Europe, allowing them to send their top team to compete in the CHL.

The day-to-day operation of the league is overseen by a chairman (as of 2023, Tony Smith), a director of hockey operations (Michael Hicks), media manager / hockey operations (Luke Fisher), head of commercial operations (Mark Brooks), and a board of directors. Disciplinary matters are handled by EIHL Hockey Operation&#x27;s Department of Player Safety (DOPS).

==History==
===Early years (2003–2010)===
British ice hockey&#x27;s structure underwent a major reorganisation in 1996. The British Hockey League (the highest senior competition since 1982, featuring the top two divisions of the sport) was disbanded and replaced by the Ice Hockey Superleague (top tier) and British National League (second tier).

The loss of the Cardiff Devils and the Newcastle Jesters in 2001 reduced the membership of the Superleague to seven; and when the Manchester Storm and the Scottish Eagles folded within a week of one another at the beginning of the 2002–03 season, there were just five remaining teams. In December 2002, the Bracknell Bees announced their intention to resign from the league to join the BNL at the end of the season; and uncertainty surrounded the future of the London Knights and their London Arena home; which ultimately led to the Knights folding in 2003. Owing a large debt to Ice Hockey UK and facing the prospect of having only three members, the league placed itself into liquidation on 30 April 2003.

The three remaining clubs (Belfast Giants, Nottingham Panthers, and Sheffield Steelers) began considering the formation of a new league with a lower wage cap and larger commitment to British players to attract other clubs into joining them. In the weeks that followed they were joined by the Basingstoke Bison, Cardiff Devils, and Coventry Blaze of the British National League and two new organisations, from London and Manchester. A team based in Glasgow was also planned, but did not come to fruition. The new league met considerable opposition from the British National League and the governing body Ice Hockey UK. The IHUK wished for the remaining Superleague clubs to integrate themselves into the BNL and initially refused to grant the new league affiliation. The Superleague clubs were reluctant to join the predominantly British-trained league after several years of playing in an import-dominated league where British players were seldom able to step up to the standard of their North American and European counterparts. The Elite League instead preferred a twelve import limit with the rest of the team being British-trained players. 

The refusal to grant affiliation caused a bitter row that showed little sign of being resolved. Despite not having the support of the governing body, the new league continued their plans. No affiliation would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches. The row also threatened the future of the Nottingham Panthers, as the National Ice Centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league to hire their arena. The issue was resolved in August 2003 when the Panthers and the NIC announced an icetime agreement. The EIHL finally gained affiliation in August 2003, with only weeks to go before the beginning of the new season.

The new league began on 12 September 2003, when the Sheffield Steelers, who went on to become the inaugural league champions, defeated the newly formed London Racers 6–1 at Alexandra Palace. Charles, Prince of Wales dropped the first puck, after unveiling a plaque. The Racers endured a difficult first season, moving to a different rink only weeks into the season and having to wait 40 games to record a win, a 3–0 victory over the Cardiff Devils. The Racers finished the season with 10 points, 38 points behind second-to-last Basingstoke. The other new team, the Manchester Phoenix, fared slightly better, qualifying for the playoff finals after finishing sixth in the league, where they were defeated 6–1 by Nottingham in the semifinal. The club played at the 17,500 capacity MEN Arena which had been home to the Manchester Storm, but Phoenix crowds averaged 2,250, well below the break-even mark of 3,000. Late in the season, the Phoenix choose to play a game at IceSheffield rather than pay the considerable cost of hiring the arena for a mid-week game (which usually had lower attendances). In the close season they allowed fans to vote on the option of either suspending playing operations while a new rink was constructed or playing in exile away from Manchester while a new rink was built. Supporters opted to suspend playing operations pending the construction of a new facility.

The second season of the EIHL saw a series of games between the EIHL clubs and the members of the BNL. In addition to three home games and three away games against their Elite opponents, each club also played one home game and one away game against the BNL clubs in crossover match-ups. Results in these crossover games counted towards a team&#x27;s points tally. The NHL lock-out also saw a number of NHL players join British clubs. Coventry won the League Title, The Challenge Cup and the Playoffs, winning the championship with an overtime victory over the Nottingham Panthers, whilst Belfast won the EIHL-BNL Crossover League.

The crossover games with the BNL clubs were seen by many to be the first stage towards an amalgamation of the two organizations into one league; essentially reforming the original BHL. However, early in the season it was revealed that two teams from the BNL, the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers, were seeking to resign from the BNL and join the EIHL; preferring the standard of hockey that the EIHL had to offer. A withdrawal of these clubs would leave the BNL with only five remaining participating teams. This situation led to the resigning teams temporarily withdrawing their Elite League applications and entering into collective discussions on the entire BNL joining the EIHL instead. The Elite League offered the BNL clubs invitations to join the EIHL structure, which were declined by the remaining teams due to unfavourable terms. Subsequently, the Capitals and Vipers both resubmitted individual applications to the Elite League; both of which were accepted. This ultimately led to the dissolution of the BNL, with the five remaining teams joining the next tier of British hockey (which consisted of the English Premier Ice Hockey League in England and the Scottish National League in Scotland). 

With the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers becoming the ninth and tenth members of the league, the 2005–06 season began with nine clubs (Manchester had opted to take another season out with no rink yet constructed). However, in November 2005, the London Racers withdrew their team from competition and immediately ceased operations. From their formation the Racers had suffered problems finding a rink with comparable facilities to those of their rivals and they had maintained only a very small fan base. The club had made the Lee Valley Ice Centre their home after playing only a small number of games at the Alexandra Palace in their first season. The facilities were very basic, seating only 900 people with an overall capacity of barely 1,000. In November 2005, during a game against the Nottingham Panthers; Panthers player Blaž Emeršič suffered a serious facial injury after colliding with a protruding object in the boards. Further concerns were raised when a game against the Sheffield Steelers was abandoned after a piece of plexiglas shattered in an irregular manner, injuring a spectator. When a similar event took place during practice a few days later; the Racers management began to question seriously the safety of the rink. With the Ice Centre unable to ensure the safety of players and spectators at Elite League games, the Racers were forced to suspend team operations effective immediately.

In January 2006, the Manchester Phoenix were granted planning permission to construct a new rink in Altrincham. A few weeks later, the Cardiff Devils also received planning permission for the construction of a new rink. The Wales National Ice Rink was earmarked for demolition and a campaign for the council to provide a new facility proved successful. With both clubs confirming their intent to take part the following season, speculation began about the possible inclusion of a tenth team to replace the London Racers. After the season was over, rumours about the possible admission of either Hull or Dundee became more and more widespread. On 22 June 2006, the Hull Stingrays were formally elected into the Elite Ice Hockey League as the tenth active member.

In June 2006, the EIHL announced the adoption of the &quot;zero tolerance&quot; interpretation of the rules with regard to holding, hooking and interference implemented in the National Hockey League during the 2005–06 season. These rules had proved highly successful in the NHL, increasing the pace of the game and leading to a rise in spectator numbers.

On 25 August 2006, the Elite League announced a sponsorship deal with the low cost airline bmibaby. The agreement saw the company&#x27;s name incorporated into the league&#x27;s title and the airline&#x27;s branding at each of the league&#x27;s ten arenas. The deal was intended to last for seven seasons, but ended prematurely during the 2008–09 season.

On 30 April 2009, the Manchester Phoenix announced that they would withdraw from the league, and play instead in the English Premier Ice Hockey League, due to cost issues. This news followed the announcement that the Basingstoke Bison were also leaving to play in the EPL for the 2009–10 season.

===League expands and changes (2010–2020)===

After losing two teams at the end of the 2008–09 season the Elite League was boosted by a new franchise joining the league. The Braehead Clan were announced as the ninth team for the 2010–11 season. On 27 April 2010, the Dundee Stars were unanimously accepted into the League by the EIHL board as the tenth team.

The Hull Stingrays withdrew from the League on 11 August 2010, announced via the club&#x27;s official website, and later confirmed on the BBC&#x27;s site. However, after a takeover from the Coventry Blaze on 17 August 2010, the Hull Stingrays confirmed that they would indeed be participating in the league for the 2010–11 season. The Stingrays again withdrew, on 24 June 2015, as the club announced on its official website that it has been placed into liquidation.

From the 2012–13 season onwards, the league has consisted of two conferences; each consisting of five teams. These are the Erhardt Conference and the Gardiner Conference. These can roughly be split into north and south, with the Erhardt featuring the teams from Belfast, Cardiff, Coventry, Nottingham, and Sheffield; and the Gardiner featuring the teams from Dundee, Edinburgh, Fife, and Glasgow along with Hull Stingrays until 2015, and their replacements Manchester Storm from 2015 onwards.

On 27 April 2017 it was announced that the Milton Keynes Lightning and Guildford Flames were joining for the start of the 2017–18 season and that the league schedule would be increased to 56 games in the regular season with three new conferences of four teams.

Conference 1 consisted of the Braehead Clan, Dundee Stars, Edinburgh Capitals and Fife Flyers known as the Scottish Conference.

Conference 2 consisted of the Coventry Blaze, Guildford Flames, Manchester Storm and Milton Keynes Lightning known as the Southern Conference.

Conference 3 consisted of the Belfast Giants, Cardiff Devils, Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers known as the Arena Teams. This meant that teams would play teams in their own conference eight times (four home and four away) totaling 24 games and play the other conference&#x27;s teams four times (two home and two away) totaling 32 games, giving the league a total of 56 games.

In April 2018, when the Murrayfield Ice Rink asked for bidders for the ice time at the arena, the Edinburgh Capitals and Murrayfield Racers (a newly formed team) bid for the rights with the Racers winning the opportunity. The Racers asked for permission to join the EIHL, but on 30 April the league refused their application and they subsequently joined the Scottish National League (SNL).

On 4 May, the EIHL released a statement explaining that they would have to move forward without the Edinburgh Capitals with a board meeting on 22 May to discuss the league future format and decide on any clubs wishing to participate in place of Edinburgh.

After the conclusion of the 2018–19 season, the Milton Keynes Lightning officially left the EIHL after just two seasons in the league and moved to the newly created National Ice Hockey League (NIHL), returning the number of teams to 10. The three conference format was also scrapped.

===Recent years (2020–present)===

The 2019–20 EIHL season was cancelled in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only the Challenge Cup (won by Sheffield Steelers) was awarded with both the league and play-offs cancelled.

The 2020–21 EIHL season, originally scheduled for a September start, was suspended indefinitely on September 15, 2020, due to ongoing coronavirus restrictions and continuing social distancing which made the league season a non-starter.

While there were tentative plans for a shortened league season, featuring a handful of sides to potentially begin play in January 2021, this idea - and the prospect of a 2020–21 season - were shelved by the league in February 2021 due to concerns around funding.

Then, in March 2021, the Elite League announced that four of the English teams (Coventry, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield) would take part in the &#x27;Elite Series&#x27; between April–May 2021, a total of 24 games to be played at Nottingham&#x27;s Motorpoint Arena, culminating in a best-of-three play-off final series. Nottingham claimed the trophy by virtue of a 2–0 series win over the Sheffield Steelers in the final, winning game one 5-3 and game two 5-2.

In the 2021–22 EIHL season, the first full season to be completed since 2018–19 due to the impacts of the Covid pandemic, the Belfast Giants won both the Elite League title and the Challenge Cup, while the Cardiff Devils won the play-offs.

In May 2022, all ten Elite League clubs agreed to increase the gameday roster size from 19 to 20 - to take effect from the 2022–23 season. Import numbers in a gameday squad were once again capped at 14.

In April 2023, the league announced that the end of season play-off final weekend would continue to be played at Nottingham&#x27;s Motorpoint Arena until at least 2029.

In the 2022–23 EIHL season, the Belfast Giants became the first team since Nottingham in 2013 to complete the Elite League grand slam, after winning the league title, Challenge Cup and play-offs. The Giants finished ahead of second placed Guildford in the league, and defeated the Fife Flyers and Cardiff Devils in the Challenge Cup and play-off finals respectively.

The following season, 2023–24, the Sheffield Steelers won their first league title since 2016, the Challenge Cup and the play-offs to complete a grand slam of their own. It was Sheffield&#x27;s first grand slam in the Elite League era and first since 2001.

In May 2024, the Elite League announced a new Challenge Cup format, taking effect from the 2024–25 season. All 10 clubs agreed to scrap the cup quarter-finals, with a group stage feeding straight into the semi-finals.

==Structure==

Several competitions fall under the jurisdiction of the Elite League.

Up until the end of the 2018–19 season, the league consisted of three conferences, the results of which were compiled in one league table:
* &quot;Gardiner Conference&quot;: Dundee Stars, Fife Flyers, and Glasgow Clan
* &quot;Patton Conference&quot;: Coventry Blaze, Guildford Flames, and Manchester Storm.
* &quot;Erhardt Conference&quot;: Belfast Giants, Cardiff Devils, Nottingham Panthers, and Sheffield Steelers.

Teams played each other six times (three home, three away), making for a 60-game regular season, but after the departure of Milton Keynes Lightning in 2019, the conference system was scrapped for the first time since 2011–12. Each team now plays 54 games.

Two points are awarded for a win and one for an overtime or penalty shootout defeat. Overtime consists of five minutes of three-on-three hockey and ends immediately if a goal is scored. The team that has most points at the end of the regular season is declared champion. Each team receives a regular season participation trophy.

The playoffs are contested by the teams with the best regular season records. The winner is crowned the champion of the British Championship. The number of teams competing in the playoffs has varied. However, since the 2006–07 season, the top eight teams of the regular season have qualified for the quarter-finals, with their league position determining their seeding. All quarter-finals are two-legged ties. Both the semi-finals and the final take place over a single weekend in April at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham.

The Challenge Cup has taken a number of different formats, ranging from a table formed from the results of designated league fixtures to groups of four teams playing on a round-robin basis at the beginning of the season. During some seasons, Elite League games have also been classed as Challenge Cup games and points counted for both. The semi-finals and final are two-legged games, the winner being the team with the highest aggregate score at the end of the second game. All quarter- and semi-finalists receive a playoff participation trophy.

==Clubs==
Since 2019 and the departure of Edinburgh Capitals and Milton Keynes Lightning from the league, the competition has consisted of the same ten teams in the longest period of member stability since the league&#x27;s inception.

Since 2003, seven teams have left the league. 
===Potential future clubs===
The Aberdeen Lynx (currently competing in the Scottish National League) have previously stated that their ambition is to establish an Elite League team in the city in the future.

The Nottingham Panthers and Glasgow Clan owner Neil Black was rumoured to be setting up a new EIHL franchise in London, playing at Wembley Arena. Black had also stated in the past that he would like to see franchises in Manchester (which has now been achieved) and Dublin.

Wayne Scholes, owner of the Telford Tigers (currently in the National Ice Hockey League), has stated that his organisation does not have any immediate plans to make the step up, but has not ruled out the possibility of joining the EIHL in the future, saying that &quot;We have had conversations with the Elite League before but they have to invite you. You can&#x27;t approach them. It is one of those things where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it&#x27;s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are.&quot;

==EIHL Champions by season==

The following table sets out the League champions, National champions and Challenge Cup winners of the EIHL era only. Several previous top-tier leagues, such as the Sekonda Super League have also existed, in which some EIHL clubs competed successfully, and the end-of-season play-offs and Challenge Cup both have a long history prior to the founding of the EIHL, again feature many of the teams currently in EIHL.

Only four teams have won a domestic grand slam in the EIHL era; Coventry Blaze in 2004–05, Nottingham Panthers in 2012–13, Belfast Giants in 2022–23 and Sheffield Steelers in 2023-24. By contrast, teams have come within one match of a treble on no less than 13 occasions, beginning with the very first season when Panthers denied Sheffield Steelers by the odd goal in seven in the Challenge Cup final, and including the four completed seasons before last where Belfast Giants twice and Cardiff Devils twice, have been denied a &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27; by losing in either the Challenge Cup or play-off final. Although dominated as might be expected by the English teams that represent the majority of the clubs in the league (winning 34 of 55 available trophies up to 2023), the sole entrants from Northern Ireland and Wales, Belfast (13 trophies) and Cardiff (eight trophies), have both enjoyed significant success across all competitions in the EIHL era. In 2023 Fife Flyers became the first Scottish team in the EIHL era to reach a major final, losing 9-3 to Belfast Giants in the Challenge Cup final.

===Most trophies in EIHL era (2003-present)===
==Players==
Elite League teams rely heavily on players from outside the United Kingdom (termed &quot;imports&quot;). The majority of these players are from North America, and typically played in the minor North American leagues such as the ECHL and American Hockey League (AHL) before coming to Britain. For example, of the 21 players to play for champions Belfast Giants in the 2005–06 season, 10 were Canadian, 8 were British and 3 were American. The league restricts the number of import players which can be dressed for a game, with a current limit of 14 imports. Player turnover is high, with a large proportion of players spending a single season at a team before moving on, and multi-year contracts are uncommon.

As would be expected in a league dominated by North American players, the style of ice hockey in Britain is similar to that played in North America, and has a more physical style than that played in other, technically natured European countries. This was demonstrated during the 2004–05 NHL lock-out. Of the NHL players to join Elite League teams, the majority were players noted for physical play rather than puck-handling skills; such as Wade Belak and Eric Cairns.

While British players account for a minority of Elite League players, the league supplies the majority of players for the British national ice hockey team. All 22 players in the Great Britain squad for the 2018 World Championships played for Elite League teams in the preceding season.

==Media coverage==
===Television broadcast deals===
In the 1980s and 1990s, Sky Sports and &quot;BBC&#x27;s Grandstand&quot; programme covered the British Hockey League and Superleague and their important games and competitions regularly.

However, in 2001 the Superleague sold its broadcasting rights to Premium TV Ltd who planned to set up a new sports channel, which never materialised. British ice hockey was left without coverage from any television network. This situation continued through the final seasons of the Superleague and into the first seasons of the Elite League.

In 2005, Elite League officials concluded an agreement with the North American Sports Network to provide a weekly highlights and news programme. These usually provide highlights from a game recorded the previous weekend and are an hour in length.

In September 2007, the Elite League announced a deal with Sky Sports for a weekly show of Elite League highlights.

In 2010, Sky Sports showed the playoff final between the Belfast Giants and Cardiff Devils live, the first time Sky had shown a live game for several years. Sky Sports have recently announced plans to show live games along with a weekly highlight show during the 2010–11 season.

In the 2013–14 season, Premier Sports acquired the rights to film and broadcast 23 games from the Elite League with a live game shown every Saturday night from 23 November onwards.

On 6 December 2016, it was announced that a new TV show called &quot;Facing Off&quot; would be broadcast on a UK free-to-air channel called &quot;Front Runner TV&quot; every Thursday, Friday and Saturday to show the highlights of the week&#x27;s EIHL games. The deal ran to the end of 2016–17 EIHL season.

Then, on 20 July 2018, the EIHL agreed a two-year deal with FreeSports to broadcast one live EIHL game every two weeks, alongside a pre-season preview show, highlights package, and live coverage of the end of season play-off final. The coverage, which was available via Freeview, Sky, Virgin, FreeSat, TalkTalk, BT Vision and online via the TVPlayer, was fronted by Aaron Murphy who previously commentated on the league for Premier Sports.

In January 2020, the league announced that Premier Sports would show live coverage of the 2020 Challenge Cup final and 2020 Elite League play-off final.

In September 2021, the league confirmed that Premier Sports had become headline sponsors and the EIHL&#x27;s exclusive television partners for three seasons, beginning from the 2021–22 season. Coverage would again be fronted by Aaron Murphy, with analysis from Paul Adey, and consist of 27 live matches - including 23 league games, the Challenge Cup final and the end of season play-off final weekend. During this time, the league was known as the Premier Sports Elite League. In November 2022, following news Viaplay had acquired Premier Sports, the Elite League&#x27;s title sponsors changed to the Viaplay Elite League to reflect the rebrand.

The EIHL were without a major television rights holder during the 2023/24 season after ending their relationship with Viaplay. However, after Premier Sports re-acquired the contract from Viaplay in April 2024, they broadcast the end of season play-off final weekend from Nottingham. Aaron Murphy, Paul Adey and Chris Ellis were again the broadcast crew.

===Other coverage===
Ice hockey receives little national media coverage in the United Kingdom. Some national newspapers list results and provide short summaries of the league&#x27;s news but more extensive coverage remains minimal. There was a small surge in interest during the 2004–05 season when newspapers such as &quot;The Times&quot; reported on the NHL players playing the Elite League as a result of the lock-out but since the lock-out ended, coverage has returned to its previous levels.

Of the national newspapers only the &quot;Daily Star&quot; has a regular ice hockey column, which appears on Tuesday and Sunday.

Coverage in the towns and cities where Elite League clubs are based is more extensive, and local newspapers have dedicated ice hockey reporters who cover the local team. Local radio stations such as BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire, BBC Radio Nottingham, and BBC Radio Sheffield all provide programming on the sport. Radio Sheffield also provides a weekly ice hockey programme &quot;Iceline&quot; while Radio Nottingham has broadcast a similar programme, &quot;Powerplay&quot;, since the later stages of the 2005–06 season, and has a 15-minute weekly preview of games on Saturday evenings during the ice hockey season after the station&#x27;s coverage of the local football teams is completed. BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire have also followed suit with &quot;Faceoff&quot;, a programme broadcast on the first Thursday of the month during the season.

The Cardiff Devils are given weekly highlights coverage on local TV station, &quot;Made in Cardiff&quot;, which is available on Freeview Ch23, Sky Guide Ch134 and Virgin Ch159.

All of the teams also provide webcasts on match nights.

==Comparison to other leagues==

In attendance, the EIHL ranks seventh among the European top leagues with a 2,842 average. Three teams are among the top 100 of the continent: 2016 Challenge Cup champions Nottingham Panthers at 38th (5,720 average), the 2016 league champions Sheffield Steelers at 64th (4,830), and the 2012 league champions Belfast Giants at 70th (4,603)

Previously, the EIHL champions were invited to play in the IIHF Continental Cup, Europe&#x27;s second-level club competition. For the 2009–10 tournament, the EIHL&#x27;s entrants began the tournament in the penultimate (third) group stage. However, with the introduction of the Champions Hockey League, this has changed. From the 2015–16 season, the top two teams in the EIHL participate in the CHL, with either the team that wins the post-season playoffs, or the team finishing third if the playoffs winner is one of the top two, entering the Continental Cup.

During the 2012–13 NHL Lockout, several NHL players plied their trade in the Elite League, including; Matt Beleskey, Paul Bissonnette, Drew Miller, Tom Sestito and Anthony Stewart.

The league has had a reputation for attracting ex-NHL players, including Dustin Kohn who played for the Sheffield Steelers, Kevin Westgarth who played for the Belfast Giants, Cam Janssen, formerly of the Nottingham Panthers, ex-Braehead Clan captain Matt Keith and Stefan Della Rovere, Ryan O&#x27;Marra of the Coventry Blaze, and Brian McGrattan who played for the Nottingham Panthers.

Elsewhere Jared Staal – brother of NHLers Eric, Marc and Jordan – played a season for the Edinburgh Capitals while Patrick Bordeleau played a season with the Cardiff Devils.

Other recent ex-NHL players in the league include Jason Williams, Ric Jackman, Jay Rosehill, Jim Vandermeer, Pavel Vorobyev, Michael Garnett, Tyson Strachan, Tim Wallace, Aaron Johnson, Dylan Olsen, Patrick Dwyer, Griffin Reinhart, and Chris Stewart.

Meanwhile, in being drafted by the Arizona Coyotes in 2018, Sheffield Steelers forward Liam Kirk became the first English born and trained player to be drafted by an NHL side. Kirk signed a three-year, entry-level contract with Arizona in June 2021.

==Criticism of the EIHL==
The main criticism levelled at the EIHL is that the league is too expensive, an accusation given credence by the collapse of the London Racers mid-season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs (most notably the Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09).

Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league&#x27;s sustained viability.

This perceived problem with expenditure was given further credence when the Hull Stingrays announced, on 11 August 2010, that they were ceasing operations immediately, due to insufficient funds from sponsorships to guarantee completing the season. They were, however, taken over on 17 August 2010 by the Coventry Blaze and therefore the Hull Stingrays continued to operate. However, Hull did fold in 2015.

In 2011, the Newcastle Vipers announced that they would not be able to compete in the 2011–12 season due to financial difficulties and lack of a permanent home stadium. Newcastle had, up to this point, been playing their home games at Whitley Bay ice rink. A proposed new stadium in the Newcastle area did not materialise.

==Expansion==
Despite there being a limited number of suitable venues for league expansion, there have been various attempts during the EIHL&#x27;s lifespan to expand the league. After the successful addition of the Braehead Clan and the Dundee Stars for the 2010–11 season, the EIHL reported that it had entered discussions with the Fife Flyers formerly of the defunct BNL, and then resident in the SNL.

On 24 June 2011, it was confirmed that the Fife Flyers had been admitted to the EIHL in time for the commencement of the 2011–12 season.

Further to this, Neil Black, owner of the Nottingham Panthers and Glasgow Clan has expressed the desire to see a Manchester team back in the EIHL by 2015, along with teams in Dublin and London, subject to there being suitable venues available.

In mid-2013, stories began to circulate that the EIHL had approached AEG with the intention of placing a London-based franchise into Wembley Arena. League chairman Tony Smith confirmed that a franchise had been awarded to a London-based group for a franchise located within the capital.

On 29 March 2016, it was announced that the Milton Keynes Lightning (playing in the second-tier English Premier League) would be joining the Elite League for the 2017–18 season. They remained in the league for two seasons.

On 24 February 2017, it was announced that the Guildford Flames would make the step-up to the Elite League for the following season, thus expanding the league to twelve teams.

<text>In the Middle Ages, variations on the liar paradox were studied under the name of insolubilia (&quot;insolubles&quot;).

==Overview==
Although the liar paradox was well known in antiquity, interest seems to have lapsed until the twelfth century, when it appears to have been reinvented independently of ancient authors. Medieval interest may have been inspired by a passage in the &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot; of Aristotle. Although the &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot; are consistently cited by medieval logicians from the earliest &quot;insolubilia&quot; literature, medieval studies of &quot;insolubilia&quot; go well beyond Aristotle. Other ancient sources which could suggest the liar paradox, including Saint Augustine, Cicero, and the quotation of Epimenides appearing in the Epistle to Titus, were not cited in discussions of &quot;insolubilia&quot;.

Adam of Balsham mentioned, in passing, some paradoxical statements (dated to 1132), but he did not dwell on the difficulties raised by these statements. Alexander Neckham, writing later in the twelfth century, explicitly recognized the paradoxical nature of &quot;insolubilia&quot;, but did not attempt to resolve the inconsistent implications of the paradox. The first resolution was given by an anonymous author at the end of the twelfth or beginning of the thirteenth century. There was an established literature on the topic by about 1320, when Thomas Bradwardine prefaced his own discussion of &quot;insolubilia&quot; with nine views then current. Interest in &quot;insolubilia&quot; continued throughout the fourteenth century, especially by Jean Buridan.

The medieval &quot;insolubilia&quot; literature seems to treat these paradoxes as difficult but not truly &quot;insoluble&quot;, and, though interesting and meriting investigation, not central to the study of logic. This may be contrasted with modern studies of self-referential paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s paradox, in which the problems are seen as fundamentally insoluble, and central to the foundations of logic.

<text>Peter Ellis (1805–1884) was a British architect and inventor of the paternoster lift from Liverpool. He is best-known for designing Oriel Chambers, built in 1864, which is the world&#x27;s first building to feature a metal-framed glass curtain wall. For this achievement he appears in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;.

From the mid-1840s he lived at 40 Falkner Square, a house which he designed and on which an English Heritage Blue Plaque is now sited.

==Buildings==

Peter Ellis designed Oriel Chambers in 1864 at the corner of Water Street and Covent Garden in Liverpool, considered by many architectural historians to be one of the most influential buildings of its age, a precursor of the modernist style in architecture and one of the earliest attempts to break away from the classical tradition of commercial architecture. It was described by Charles Reilly, Professor of Architecture at Liverpool University as the &quot;oddest building in Liverpool, at once so logical and so disagreeable...as a cellular habitation for the human insect it is a distinct asset to the town,&quot; and by Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;one of the most remarkable buildings of its date in Europe.&quot;

His other well-known commission was 16 Cook Street, Liverpool, of 1866. This building has been noted for its &quot;surprisingly modern&quot; spiral staircase, cantilevered out from the main building and clad with sheets of iron and glass.

From evidence in the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; he is known to have had commissions for at least four other buildings (1856-1874), whilst the Corporation Lease Registers reveal that his early career (1833-1844) involved his design and construction of a variety of houses for sale, rent or personal use (see Career).

==Career==

Peter Ellis was born on 1 August 1805 at Shaw&#x27;s Brow (subsequently renamed William Brown Street), the third son in a family of seven born to Peter Ellis senior and Ann (née Appleton). The family moved to Primrose Hill in 1807 where Peter&#x27;s father was involved in the construction of courts, and to Gloucester Street (now buried beneath Lime Street Station) in 1811 where his father worked with other builders in developing the area. In 1822 they moved to Low Hill and it was whilst living there that Peter subsequently met Mary Helen Syers who was living in Everton Village and whom he married in 1836.

Although Peter first appeared in &quot;Gore&#x27;s Liverpool Directory&quot; in 1834 as an architect with an office in Renshaw Street, prior to that he would have learned his trade working with his father on several terraces of properties in Audley Street (1824), Kent Square (1830), and Great George Square / Upper Pitt Street (1832). Then in 1833 &quot;Peter Ellis the Younger of Liverpool Surveyor&quot; first appeared in the Corporation Lease Register regarding terraces of property to be built along the south east side of Great George Square and into Cookson Street.

In 1835 Peter acquired a lease on property and neighbouring building land in Sandon Street (originally a part of Chatham Street). One of the properties became Peter and Mary&#x27;s first home, and it was whilst they were living there that Peter submitted designs for the 1839 St George&#x27;s Hall competition subsequently won by Harvey Lonsdale Elmes. In 1843 Peter acquired a lease upon which he built 78 Canning Street and in the following year he obtained a lease on neighbouring land upon which he built what became 40 Falkner Square, the house in which he and Mary lived for the remainder of Peter&#x27;s life.

In 1845 Peter moved his office to Clayton Square and it was whilst he was there, in 1856, that he was commissioned to design St Saviour&#x27;s National Schools in Canning Street (the site now lies beneath the Liverpool Women&#x27;s Hospital), and, later, the Hardman Street Homoeopathic Dispensary, opened in 1860.

In the early 1860s Peter moved offices, briefly to Bank Buildings and then for a longer period to Orange Court (they lay on opposite sides of Castle Street), and it was in 1863 that a fire destroyed offices and a warehouse at the junction of Water Street and Covent Garden. The building was owned by Rev. Thomas Anderson and it was from him that Peter received the commission to design Oriel Chambers, the fire-proof replacement that was constructed upon the site (1864–65). Whilst still at Orange Court, Peter was then commissioned by the accountants Paterson and Thomas to design 16 Cook Street (1866–68), also a replacement for a pre-existing building.

Quentin Hughes suggested that it was possible that Peter&#x27;s career as an architect was adversely affected by criticism of Oriel Chambers, such as that which appeared in &quot;The Builder&quot; of 20 January 1866, where it was described as a &quot;large agglommeration of protruding plate glass bubbles&quot;, a &quot;vast abortion&quot; without any aesthetic qualities. He also noted that although Peter practised for a further eighteen years after the Cook Street commission, his entry in the 1867 edition of &quot;Gore&#x27;s Directory of Liverpool&quot; describes him as both architect and civil engineer, whilst in the 1884 directory the term &quot;civil engineer&quot; precedes &quot;architect&quot;, suggesting that architecture became a secondary strand in his career.

The extent to which the Oriel Chambers criticism was of primary significance in influencing either Peter&#x27;s future career or interests remains unclear. After &quot;The Builder&quot; article he went on to design a Welsh Baptist Chapel in Hall Lane and an office/warehouse in School Lane, whilst, by 1865 (if not earlier), he had already become sufficiently interested in engineering to begin producing patents on a variety of topics, the most significant of which concerned the invention of a continuously moving lift which he subsequently installed in Oriel Chambers in 1869.

Peter moved his office from Orange Court to Oriel Chambers in 1871, and it was there that he continued to practice as an architect, valuer, surveyor and civil engineer, with the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; containing reports and advertisements concerning his work up to May 1884. He died at the age of 79 at his home at 40 Falkner Square on 20 October 1884, the death certificate recording endocarditis (inflammation of the lining membrane of the heart) and pneumonia as the causes. He was buried on 23 October, and the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; the following day carried a warm tribute to him, of which this extract is representative: &quot;The deceased gentleman was held in high esteem by the members of his own profession and solicitors and others with whom he had business relations...Mr. Ellis, for more than half a century, was at the head of the leading practice in his way of business in Liverpool, and was ever ready with his kindly advice to those who sought it.&quot; Peter outlived all his siblings but he and Mary died without having had the joy of bringing up a son or daughter. They lie at peace together in Toxteth Cemetery.

==Influence==

Peter Ellis&#x27;s work may have influenced that of the American architect John Wellborn Root who came to Liverpool when 16 Cook Street was being constructed. For example, in the Rookery Building, Chicago, Root used a glass and iron spiral staircase similar to that in 16 Cook Street.

Quentin Hughes has suggested that Ellis&#x27;s career would have been very different if, like Root, he had gone to Chicago where his use of oriel windows to provide interior daylighting was adopted and exploited by American architects.

&quot;Oriel Chambers, along with the work of Kahn, were real touchstones for the practice&quot; of Arup Associates.

<doc id="1034235" wikidata="Q6469307" url="?curid=1034235" title="Ladder Bay (Saba)">
<text>Ladder Bay is an anchorage on the leeward side of the Caribbean island of Saba. The bay sits on the west side of the island, directly under a set of 800 steps hand carved into the rocks locally known as &quot;The Ladder&quot;. Until the construction of Saba&#x27;s first pier in the 1970s, Ladder Bay was a primary point of entry for supplies to the island. An abandoned customs house sits on the lip of a cliff overlooking the bay.

== History ==
Before European colonization, the area above Ladder Bay may have been occupied by Amerindians during the Ceramic Era. Archeologists have not yet found evidence of an Amerindian settlement above Ladder Bay, but they have found ceramic artifacts in the area.

Saba was settled by Europeans in the mid-17th century. There is long-standing documentation of early European settlements near Tent Bay, Fort Bay, and above Well&#x27;s Bay. But more recently, archeologists have found 17th-century ceramics above Ladder Bay, suggesting the area may have been occupied during early years of European settlement.

From the 1650s until the 1970s, the two primary ports of entry for Saba were at Ladder Bay and Fort Bay. Boats could offload cargo at Ladder Bay, which would then be transported up &quot;The Ladder&quot;, a series of steps carved into the ridge above Ladder Bay. The cargo would then be transported to Saba&#x27;s capital, The Bottom, via a footpath through an area known as The Gap.

Both cargo and people were brought onto Saba via The Ladder. Even large items were transported up The Ladder, one of the most famous being a piano.

In the 1930s, The Ladder in its current form, as well as the Customs House, were constructed. The steps of The Ladder were made of poured concrete, and the staircase walls from a mixture of concrete and rock.

In the 1970s, the Capt. Chance Leo Pier was constructed at Fort Bay. With a harbor at Fort Bay, the use of Ladder Bay as a port fell out of use. In 2017, the bottom 2 meters (6.5 ft) of The Ladder were severely damaged by Hurricane Maria.

Today, &quot;The Ladder&quot; is an iconic Saban monument and popular hiking location, and Ladder Bay is an official mooring area and the site of multiple popular dive sites.

== Hiking ==
The Ladder (Trail): The trailhead is located between The Bottom and Well&#x27;s Bay. The trail goes past the old customs house, and descends all 800 steps of The Ladder, before coming back up. The strenuous hike takes about 1 hour round trip. The dry forest portion of the trail includes diverse trees, including mahogany trees (e.g. &quot;Swietenia mahagoni&quot;) and cinnamon trees (&quot;Pimenta racemosa&quot;).

Middle Island Trail: The trail begins close to The Ladder trail, and has views of Well&#x27;s Bay and Ladder Bay. It is a heritage trail that includes ruins of an open cistern, stone walls of a farm, and a cavern. The hike takes about 40 minutes one-way.

== Diving ==

Ladder Bay is the location of multiple dive sites for scuba divers.

* Porites Point, named for the quantity of &quot;Porites&quot; coral at the locating, including Mustardhill Coral (&quot;Porites astreoides&quot;) and Branching Finger Coral (&quot;Porites furcata&quot;).
* Babylon, a site with dramatic overhangs (possibly reminiscent of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon) home to sea fans, as well as a site for seeing sharks, turtles, eels, and fish.
* Ladder Labyrinth, named for the labyrinth of tall, 10-foot coral and rock ridges that are for shrimp, crabs, and lobsters.
* 50/50, named for divers&#x27; choice of multiple areas to explore, including underwater lava formations, a shallow reef area, and a rubble field.

At Babylon, Ladder Labyrinth, and 50/50, divers can place their hands on hot, sulfur-colored sand, resulting from the active status of Saba&#x27;s volcano.

== Marine life ==

The bay is home to a variety of fish, including Burrfish, Chromis, Filefish, Glassy Sweepers, Horse-eye Jacks, Lancer Dragonets, Lizardfish, Peacock Flounders, Pikeblennies, Schoolmasters, Spotted Drums, Tarpons, Yellowfin Groupers, and Yellowhead Jawfish, as well as Nurse Sharks and Reef sharks.

Other marine life in Ladder Bay includes Channel Clinging Crabs, Green Turtles, Hawksbill Turtles, Spotted Moray Eels, Squat Lobster, and Tigertail Sea Cucumber.

Ladder Bay&#x27;s reefs include a variety of coral. The most common are Star coral (&quot;Astreopora)&quot;, Brain coral, and Gorgonian (&quot;Alcyonacea&quot;) coral, as well as &quot;Porites&quot; coral at the Porites Point dive site. The bay is also home to sea fans such as Deepwater Seafans.

== Moorings ==
Saba has two designated anchorage zones within the Saba National Marine Park: one between Ladder Bay and Wells Bay (west coast), and one in front of Fort Bay (southern coast). Between Ladder Bay and Wells Bay, the Saba National Marine Park manages about half a dozen moorings that are in about 60 feet (18 m) of water. The use of mooring buoys can help eliminator anchor damage to coral reefs.

Passengers of moored boats are advised to enter the island via through Fort Bay Harbor for safety reasons. Additionally, passengers from arriving yachts are required to go to Fort Bay to clear Customs and Immigration, as well as to check in and out with the Saba&#x27;s Harbor Master.

In March 2017, a French-owned boat broke free of its mooring, and became stranded on the rocks in Ladder Bay. No one was aboard, and the boat was successfully salvaged a few days later. That same year another vessel ran aground at Ladder Bay; all passengers were unharmed. In April 2023, a mooring holding a French charter boat broke off during the night while the crew was asleep. The crew was alerted and safely re-anchored, but only two visitor moorings remain.

<doc id="1034241" wikidata="Q720396" url="?curid=1034241" title="Henry Pownall">
<text>Lieutenant General Sir Henry Royds Pownall, (19 November 1887 – 10 June 1961) was a senior British Army officer who held several command and staff positions during the Second World War. In particular, he was chief of staff to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France and Belgium until the battle of France in May/June 1940. He was later chief of staff to General Sir Archibald Wavell until the fall of Singapore in February 1942, and was then chief of staff to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten in South East Asia in 1943–1944.

==Early career==
Henry Royds Pownall was born in London on 19 November 1887, the second son of Charles Assheton Whately Pownall and his wife, Dora Bourne Royds. His brother was Sir Assheton Pownall and his Grandfather The Ven. Assheton Pownall Archdeacon of Leicester. His father Charles Pownall was a consulting engineer with the Japanese railways, and Pownall lived in Japan from when he was three until he was eight years old. He received his education at Rugby School and Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery on 20 December 1906. He began his military service with the Royal Horse Artillery, where he was stationed at Lucknow with U Battery. He was promoted to lieutenant on 20 December 1909.

==First World War==
During the First World War, Pownall served on the Western Front in France and Belgium. He was promoted to captain on 30 October 1914, and awarded the Military Cross on 1 January 1917. and major on 31 March 1917. He was Brigade Major, Royal Artillery, of the 17th Division from 12 April 1917 to 12 March 1919. For his service during the war he was twice mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 1 January 1918.

==Interbellum==
On 10 December 1918, Pownall married Lucy Louttit, the widow of Captain John Gray, a British Indian Army officer of the 36th Sikhs who had been killed in the siege of Kut Al Amara in 1916. They had no children, but he acquired a stepson, Willoughby Gray, through his marriage.

Pownall attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1920 to 1921, and then served as a brigade major at the School of Artillery in Larkhill from 1924 to 1925. He continued his training and education as General Staff Officer (Grade 2) at the Staff College, Camberley from 1926 to 1929, where he became a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 3 January 1928. After completing his training at Staff College he took part in operations on the north west frontier of India through 1931, for which he was mentioned in despatches a third time, and awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order.

Pownall attended the Imperial Defence College in 1932, and, following this, he held a series of staff appointments, serving as the Military Assistant Secretary for the Committee of Imperial Defence from 1933 to 1935, then as Deputy Secretary for the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1936. His rank of lieutenant-colonel became substantive on 31 January 1935, and he was promoted to colonel on 1 May 1935, with his seniority backdated to 1 January 1932. From 1936 to 1938, he was Commandant of the Royal School of Artillery, with the rank of brigadier from 15 September 1936. As the threat of war grew, he was Director of Military Operations and Intelligence in the War Office from 1938 to 1939. He was promoted to major-general on 26 March 1938.

==Second World War==

Britain entered the war on 3 September 1939, and the following day Pownall was appointed Chief of General Staff of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), with the acting rank of lieutenant-general. He served in this capacity in France and Belgium until after the fall of France in June 1940, He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 11 July 1940, and again mentioned in despatches.

Pownall then assumed the position of inspector general for the recently created Home Guard and was Commander of British Troops in Northern Ireland, before being appointed the Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff (VCIGS) in the War Office in 1941. It was rumoured that he might succeed Field Marshal Sir John Dill as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), but this did not occur, Winston Churchill wanted to appoint Major-General Archibald Nye, but Nye managed to persuade him to appoint General Sir Alan Brooke. Whereupon Nye was appointed VCIGS.

Pownall became commander-in-chief of the British Far East Command in South East Asia from December 1941 until 1942, which did not achieve anything of note when it was succeeded by the short-lived ABDACOM, and he became chief of staff to General Sir Archibald Wavell. His rank of lieutenant-general became substantive on 17 January 1942. For this service, he was mentioned in despatches once more, and he was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. 

After ABDACOM was dissolved in February 1942, Pownall assumed the role of Commander-in-Chief, Ceylon, and then became commander-in-chief of the Persia and Iraq theatres in 1943. Finally, he was chief of staff to Vice Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of the Allied South East Asia Command from 1943 to 1944. He had an operation to remove a kidney stone on 12 August 1944 and did not return to duty until October. Mountbatten had doubts about Pownall&#x27;s health and asked for a replacement. He handed over to Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning in December 1944.

Pownall was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1945 New Year Honours on 1 January 1945, but never held another command. He retired from the British Army on 8 September 1945.

==Post war==
After the war, Pownall was chairman of Friary Meux Limited and a member of the committee of Lloyds Bank. He was the Chief Commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade from 1947 to 1949, and became the chancellor of the Order of St John in 1951. He served as a military consultant on the writing of Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The Second World War&quot; from 1948 to 1954.
Pownall died in London on 10 June 1961, aged 73. His papers are in the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives.

<doc id="1034243" wikidata="Q694081" url="?curid=1034243" title="Arno (singer)">
<text>Arnold Charles Ernest Hintjens (21 May 1949 – 23 April 2022), better known by his stage name Arno, was a Belgian singer. He was the frontman of TC Matic, one of the best-known Belgian bands of the 1980s. After the band split in 1986 he enjoyed a solo career.

==Career==
Arno sang in a mixture of English, French, Dutch and his native Ostend-Flemish dialect. For TC Matic, a band which achieved moderate artistic success throughout Europe, he wrote or co-wrote all the band&#x27;s material, much of it together with guitarist and producer Jean-Marie Aerts. After going solo he released more than a dozen albums during a successful career. In 2002 he received the title &quot;Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres&quot; (Knight in the Arts and Literature) of the French government. A 2004 biography by Gilles Deleux was translated in Dutch as &quot;Een lach en een traan&quot; (&quot;A Smile and a Tear&quot;).

In the Belgian film &quot;Camping Cosmos&quot; he played the homosexual lifeguard Harry who does not pay attention to Lolo Ferrari who is incarnating a caricature of Pamela Anderson.

At the beginning of 2020, Arno postponed his upcoming tour after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Until the end of his life he was performing and recording music. &quot;Opex&quot; was his last record, recorded while he was very ill. He died from the disease on 23 April 2022, in Brussels, at the age of 72.

<doc id="1034244" wikidata="Q666074" url="?curid=1034244" title="ECW World Heavyweight Championship">
<text>The ECW World Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship originally used in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and later, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was the original world title of the ECW promotion, spun off from the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. It was established under ECW in 1994 but was originally introduced in 1992 by the promotion&#x27;s precursor, Eastern Championship Wrestling, a territory of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). The inaugural champion was Jimmy Snuka in 1992; however, WWE considers the inaugural world heavyweight champion to be Shane Douglas, with his reign beginning on August 27, 1994, when Eastern Championship Wrestling split from the NWA to become Extreme Championship Wrestling.

The title was deactivated in 2001 when ECW went out of business. The assets of ECW were then purchased by WWE two years later during the summer of 2003. In 2006, WWE reactivated the championship as the world title of their newly established ECW brand. It was the third concurrently active world championship in the promotion, complementing the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship of the other two brands, Raw and SmackDown. The ECW Championship briefly appeared as the sole world title of the Raw brand in 2008 as a result of that year&#x27;s draft. When WWE disbanded the ECW brand in 2010, the championship was subsequently retired following the final episode of &quot;ECW&quot; with Ezekiel Jackson as the final titleholder, who consequently had the shortest reign at 2 minutes, 25 seconds as he won it during the episode.

==History==
===Origin===

The ECW World Heavyweight Championship was introduced originally in 1992 as the NWA-ECW Heavyweight Championship with Jimmy Snuka becoming the inaugural champion on April 25. However, its origin is attributed to events that began in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), an organization with many members promotions. In the early 1990s, Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) was a member of the NWA and by 1994, the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, the world title of the NWA, was vacant. Consequently, a tournament was organized to crown a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion and on August 27, NWA-ECW Heavyweight Champion Shane Douglas defeated 2 Cold Scorpio in the finals to win the title. However, Douglas immediately relinquished the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and instead proclaimed himself the new ECW World Heavyweight Champion. ECW subsequently seceded from the NWA and became Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). The ECW World Heavyweight Championship was thus established, spun off from the NWA title. It remained active until April 11, 2001, when ECW closed; World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) subsequently purchased its assets in 2003. The final champion Rhyno went on to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 2005.

===Recommission===
By 2005, WWE began reintroducing ECW through content from the ECW video library and a series of books, which included the release of &quot;The Rise and Fall of ECW&quot; documentary. With heightened and rejuvenated interest in the ECW franchise, WWE organized ECW One Night Stand on June 12, a reunion event that featured ECW alumni. Due to the financial and critical success of the production, WWE produced the second ECW One Night Stand on June 11, 2006, which served as the premiere event in the relaunch of the ECW franchise as a third WWE brand, complementary to Raw and SmackDown. On June 13, Paul Heyman, former ECW owner and newly appointed figurehead for the ECW brand, recommissioned the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to be the brand&#x27;s world title and awarded it to Rob Van Dam as a result of winning the WWE Championship at One Night Stand 2006. Heyman had originally stated that either the WWE Championship or the World Heavyweight Championship would &quot;become&quot; the ECW World Heavyweight Championship if a competitor designated to the ECW brand became WWE Champion or World Heavyweight Champion at the event. However, Rob Van Dam later declared that he would hold both titles simultaneously instead. The title became known as the ECW World Championship in July 2006, and later simply as the ECW Championship in July 2007.

===ECW World Championship Tournament (2007)===
The ECW World Championship Tournament was a tournament created to determine a new ECW World Champion after Bobby Lashley vacated his championship due to being drafted to &quot;Raw&quot; on June 11, 2007. The finals took place at . This tournament is notable because one of the semi-final rounds was Chris Benoit&#x27;s final match. The tournament final was supposed to be Benoit vs CM Punk but Benoit no-showed the event and was replaced by Johnny Nitro, who would go on to win the title. It was reported the day after the event that Benoit, his wife Nancy, and their son Daniel were found dead in their home in suburban Atlanta. The day after police ruled that Benoit himself had killed his wife and son before committing suicide. This event has gone on to be known as the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
(*) – Johnny Nitro was an event-day replacement added by WWE after Chris Benoit was a no-show, with the official statement a &quot;family emergency&quot;. It was later discovered Benoit&#x27;s double murder/suicide had taken place that weekend.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Brand designation===
Following the events of the WWE brand extension, an annual WWE draft was established, in which select members of the WWE roster are reassigned to a different brand. ECW was revived as a third brand in 2006 to rival Raw and SmackDown and continued to operate until February 16, 2010, rendering the title inactive once again.

==Championship belt designs==

The original belt was a five-plate title belt made by Mike Vartanian. The belt was an exact copy of NWA-ECW&#x27;s forerunner Tri-State Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s Heavyweight title. The only difference was that the NWA-ECW&#x27;s main plate featured the promotion’s name and had areas painted blue. During this belt&#x27;s period of use, it was treated badly and was grinded, repainted, and had jewels placed on the main plate, which would explain why it appears different in almost every photo of it. By the time the belt was replaced, it was in a very bad state and two of the side plates were broken off or missing.

When Eastern Championship Wrestling withdrew from the NWA to become Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1994, it continued using this belt until 1996 when it had a new belt created starting during Raven&#x27;s second title reign and was used through 1998.

In 1998, ECW had a new belt created for its championship that would be used until the promotion ceased operations in 2001.

Soon after its recommissioning, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship belt design was updated to a design similar to the belt used before ECW&#x27;s original closure in 2001, which featured a black leather strap with a snakeskin pattern on the rear, snaps to wrap around the waist of the wrestler who wore it, and five pieces made of gold. In the middle of the strap was a large centerpiece, which featured a design of a blue globe in the center, and to the left and right of the globe were a pair of baseball bats wrapped in barbed wire. At the top of the piece, a purple ECW logo and the words &quot;World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion&quot; were engraved with the words &quot;Heavyweight Wrestling&quot; in red, which gave the text a blood-like appearance. In addition, the entire piece was engraved with a pattern similar to that of a steel cage. Along the strap, on both ends, were four smaller pieces that featured a design similar to that of the centerpiece. The new belt as of June 20, 2006, was differentiated by a full black strap with barbed wire tooling, red ECW logos, and the innards of the steel cage pattern outlined in black.

On July 22, 2008, ECW General Manager Theodore Long introduced a new belt design for the ECW Championship. This design featured a large black leather strap with five platinum pieces. The large centerpiece features a design of a phoenix over a globe in the center with its wings expanded and rays of light emitting from it. At the top of the piece, the WWE logo and the words &quot;World Wrestling Entertainment&quot; were engraved with &quot;ECW&quot; in large letters engraved prominently over the phoenix. A nameplate, which had the name of the reigning champion etched, was located below it and at the bottom of the piece, the word &quot;Champion&quot; was engraved. Additionally, the entire piece was bordered by a jagged saw-like pattern. Along the strap, on both ends, were four small biker cross-shape pieces that featured a design similar to that of the centerpiece.

==Reigns==

Overall, there have been 49 ECW World Heavyweight Championship reigns shared among 32 individuals. The inaugural champion was Jimmy Snuka, who won the title by defeating Salvatore Bellomo in April 1992. The Sandman holds the most reigns as champion, with five. Shane Douglas, in his fourth reign, had the longest reign in the title&#x27;s history which lasted 406 days. Ezekiel Jackson&#x27;s 3-minute reign following his defeat of Christian on the television finale of &quot;ECW&quot; is the shortest, as the title was retired with the cancellation of the ECW brand. Christian&#x27;s second reign was the longest under WWE at 205 days.

<doc id="1034248" wikidata="Q7102250" url="?curid=1034248" title="Oriel Chambers">
<text>Oriel Chambers is an office building located on Water Street near the town hall in Liverpool, England. It was the world&#x27;s first building featuring a metal-framed glass curtain wall, which has since become a defining feature of skyscrapers around the world. Designed by architect Peter Ellis and built in 1864, it has been grade I listed due to its outstanding importance.

==History==
Ellis won the commission for Oriel Chambers by competition and completed it in 1864 as evidenced by the building&#x27;s inscription &quot;A.D. 1864&quot; in the gable. It comprises of floor space set over five storeys. Ellis maximised the influx of light by employing a grid of oriel windows, which became the building&#x27;s defining feature. 

Initially, it was not well received. &quot;The Builder&quot; of 20 January 1866 savaged it:
&quot;The plainest brick warehouse in town is infinitely superior as a building to that large agglomeration of protruding plate-glass bubbles in Water Street termed Oriel Chambers. Did we not see this vast abortion – which would be depressing were it not ludicrous – with our own eyes, we should have doubted the possibility of its existence. Where and in what are their beauties supposed to lie?&quot;

However, the potential of Ellis&#x27;s design was not lost on all of his contemporaries. John Wellborn Root studied in Liverpool as a teenaged boy, having been sent there by his father to be safe from the American Civil War following the Atlanta Campaign (1864). In all likelihood, he studied the then-brand-new Oriel Chambers and put the lessons learned to good use when he developed into an important architect of the Chicago School of Architecture, exporting Ellis&#x27;s ideas across the Atlantic Ocean. Long rows of bay windows (of which oriels are a type) characterise some of Burnham and Root&#x27;s 1880s American skyscrapers.

More importantly, Oriel Chambers, and Ellis&#x27;s building at 16 Cook Street, Liverpool, are amongst the precursors of modernist architecture for another reason. In addition to the extensive use of glass on their facades, both boast metal-framed glass curtain walls toward the courtyards, which makes them two of the world&#x27;s first buildings to include this feature. Both buildings rely on H-section iron columns at the perimeter, which support the floors and cladding. Ellis&#x27;s method for cladding was, however, not adopted by Burnham and Root: their Monadnock Building of 1891 has its distinctive bay windows still set in load-bearing brickwork. 

Recognising its modernity, unsurprisingly, the critical assessment of Oriel Chambers was far more favourable in the 20th century. Nikolaus Pevsner called it &quot;one of the most remarkable buildings of its date in Europe&quot; and in his earlier book, &quot;Pioneers of Modern Design&quot;, describes it thus:
The delicacy of the ironwork in the plate-glass oriel windows and the curtain walling at the back with the vertical supports retracted yet visible from outside is almost unbelievably ahead of its time.

Architect Adam Caruso (born 1962) describes Oriel Chambers in near-poetic words:
Its membranous windows are almost an expression of the open space of the interior pressing out into the space of the street.

==Today==
Today the building looks a little different, combining its period architecture with a 1950s extension added after German aerial bombing destroyed a small section during the Second World War.

In 2006 it was purchased from DCT Developments by Bruntwood for just over £5 million who then spent £750,000 refurbishing the building. Bruntwood sold the building in 2019 to Yakel Property Investment who planned to undertake works to update the building.

The building&#x27;s primary tenant is a set of barristers&#x27; chambers, which has been in occupation in various parts since 1965.

==Popular culture==
Oriel Chambers and 16 Cook Street were featured in the first episode of John Grundy&#x27;s television series &quot;Grundy&#x27;s Northern Pride&quot;, which focused on buildings in the north of England.

<text>Saint Gobain (died 670), also known as Goban, was an Irish monk and spiritual student of Saint Fursey at Burgh Castle, Norfolk, England.

Born in Ireland, he was a brother of Saint Wasnon, (to whom a church is dedicated in Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut). Gobain accompanied Fursey to France. Some accounts have him staying at the Abbey of Saint Vincent in Picardy, or the abbey of Corbény in Champagne, before settling in a hermitage in the forest of Voas, near the present Saint-Gobain. There he brought forth a spring by thrusting his pilgrim&#x27;s staff into the ground.

In 670, Gobain was beheaded by marauders, and buried in his oratory, which became a place of pilgrimage. His feast day is observed on 20 June.

<text>In chemistry, dehydrogenation is a chemical reaction that involves the removal of hydrogen, usually from an organic molecule. It is the reverse of hydrogenation. Dehydrogenation is important, both as a useful reaction and a serious problem. At its simplest, it is a useful way of converting alkanes, which are relatively inert and thus low-valued, to olefins, which are reactive and thus more valuable. Alkenes are precursors to aldehydes (), alcohols (), polymers, and aromatics. As a problematic reaction, the fouling and inactivation of many catalysts arises via coking, which is the dehydrogenative polymerization of organic substrates.

Enzymes that catalyze dehydrogenation are called dehydrogenases.

In metal manufacturing and repairs, dehydrogenation is a thermal treatment which consists in removing the hydrogen absorbed by an object during an electrochemical or chemical process, performed in a specific oven at a temperature of for a minimum time of 2 hours.

==Heterogeneous catalytic routes==
===Styrene===
Dehydrogenation processes are used extensively to produce aromatics in the petrochemical industry. Such processes are highly endothermic and require temperatures of 500 °C and above. Dehydrogenation also converts saturated fats to unsaturated fats. One of the largest scale dehydrogenation reactions is the production of styrene by dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. Typical dehydrogenation catalysts are based on iron(III) oxide, promoted by several percent potassium oxide or potassium carbonate.

===Other alkenes===
The cracking processes especially fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracker produce high-purity mono-olefins from paraffins. Typical operating conditions use chromium (III) oxide catalyst at 500 °C. Target products are propylene, butenes, and isopentane, etc. These simple compounds are important raw materials for the synthesis of polymers and gasoline additives.

===Alcohols to aldehydes===
Alcohols can be selectively dehydrogenated to give aldehydes. This in employed in the industrial production of butanone and is important in the production of certain aroma compounds.

==Oxidative dehydrogenation==
Relative to thermal cracking of alkanes, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is of interest for two reasons: (1) undesired reactions take place at high temperature leading to coking and catalyst deactivation, making frequent regeneration of the catalyst unavoidable, (2) thermal dehydrogenation is expensive as it requires a large amount of heat. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane is an alternative to classical dehydrogenation, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes.

Formaldehyde is produced industrially by oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol. This reaction can also be viewed as a dehydrogenation using as the acceptor. The most common catalysts are silver metal, iron(III) oxide, iron molybdenum oxides [e.g. iron(III) molybdate] with a molybdenum-enriched surface, or vanadium oxides. In the commonly used formox process, methanol and oxygen react at ca.  in the presence of iron oxide in combination with molybdenum and/or vanadium to produce formaldehyde according to the chemical equation:

==Homogeneous catalytic routes==
A variety of dehydrogenation processes have been described for organic compounds. These dehydrogenation is of interest in the synthesis of fine organic chemicals. Such reactions often rely on transition metal catalysts. Dehydrogenation of unfunctionalized alkanes can be effected by homogeneous catalysis. Especially active for this reaction are pincer complexes.

==Stoichiometric processes==
Dehydrogenation of amines to nitriles can be accomplished using a variety of reagents, such as iodine pentafluoride ().

In typical aromatization, six-membered alicyclic rings, e.g. cyclohexene, can be aromatized in the presence of hydrogenation acceptors. The elements sulfur and selenium promote this process. On the laboratory scale, quinones, especially 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) are effective.

==Main group hydrides==

The dehydrogenative coupling of silanes has also been developed.
The dehydrogenation of amine-boranes is related reaction. This process once gained interests for its potential for hydrogen storage.

==Early life==
Tisha Michelle Campbell was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and raised in Newark, New Jersey, where she attended Newark Arts High School, and also East Orange, New Jersey, where she attended Washington Academy of Music. The eldest of her parents&#x27; four children, Campbell grew up singing, encouraged by her family&#x27;s love for music. Her mother, Hattie &quot;Mona&quot; Washington (née Raye; formerly Shockley and Campbell), was a nurse, talent manager, gospel singer, and vocal coach. Her father, Clifton Campbell, was a factory worker, singer, and chess master, who worked with underprivileged children. Through her father, Campbell has an older half-brother and two younger half-sisters. Campbell has said that she was raped at age three by a male family friend who was baby-sitting her at the time.

==Career==
===Acting===
Campbell&#x27;s first television appearance was at the age of six, in an episode in 1974 of the PBS show &quot;The Big Blue Marble&quot;. As a child, she won many talent shows, going on to appear in such children&#x27;s programs as &quot;Kids Are People Too&quot;, &quot;Unicorn Tales&quot; (played lead Daisy Bunsen in episode, &quot;The Magnificent Major&quot;), and &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. At age 17, she performed in the musical feature film, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; as Chiffon, one of The Supremes-like girl group Greek Chorus, along with future &quot;Martin&quot; co-star and best friend, Tichina Arnold.

After graduating from the Arts High School in Newark, she moved to Hollywood, where she became a star on the NBC musical comedy-drama series, &quot;Rags to Riches&quot; (1987–88). She later starred in the musical comedy drama film &quot;School Daze&quot;, directed by Spike Lee, as Jane Toussaint.

In 1989, Campbell costarred in the crime film &quot;Rooftops&quot;. The following year, she starred alongside Eddie Murphy in the action comedy &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot;. She later appeared in a supporting role in the 1992 romantic comedy &quot;Boomerang&quot;, also starring Murphy. Her most notable film credit is 1990 comedy &quot;House Party&quot; for which she received Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination. She later co starred in its two sequels; &quot;House Party 2&quot; (1991), and &quot;House Party 3&quot; (1994). In 1997, she received her star billed role in the Trimark Pictures&#x27; comedy film &quot;Sprung&quot;. She later had the leading role in the independent drama film &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot; (2002), and appeared in Kevin Smith&#x27;s sex comedy film &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; (2008) playing the acerbic wife of Craig Robinson&#x27;s character.

In 1992, Campbell was cast as Gina Waters-Payne in the Fox comedy series &quot;Martin&quot;. She left the show in November 1996, returning to work after settling a lawsuit accusing co-star Martin Lawrence of sexual harassment. Campbell continued in the role until the series ended in 1997. The following year, she starred opposite Diahann Carroll in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot; (1998). Campbell returned to television in 2001, starring opposite Damon Wayans in the ABC comedy series &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;. In 2003, she won NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series for her role. The series ran for five seasons, ending in 2005.

After &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, Campbell was a regular in the Lifetime comedy series &quot;Rita Rocks&quot; (2008–09). In 2011, she starred opposite Ally Walker in the Lifetime police drama &quot;The Protector&quot;. The series was canceled after a single season. Also in 2011, she starred in the acclaimed Disney Channel original film &quot;Lemonade Mouth&quot;. In September 2015, she was cast in the ABC sitcom &quot;Dr. Ken&quot;, starring Ken Jeong. The series was cancelled after two seasons in 2017. In the beginning of 2018, she played Olympic gymnast Simone Biles&#x27; mother in the Lifetime movie &quot;The Simone Biles Story: Courage to Soar&quot;. Later in 2018, Campbell starred on the ABC drama pilot &quot;The Holmes Sisters&quot; about the lives of five African-American sisters, all officers in the NYPD. It was produced by Regina King and Robin Roberts.

===Music===
In 1993, Campbell released her debut album, &quot;Tisha&quot;, which was a moderate success, selling 40,000 copies. Two singles received minor airplay on the R&amp;B stations: &quot;Push&quot;, which was produced by Derek Bramble, and &quot;Love Me Down&quot;. Campbell contributed vocals for the soundtrack of the 1997 film, &quot;Sprung&quot;, in which she starred, singing a cover version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask My Neighbor&quot; with Tichina Arnold.

She appeared in several music videos in the 1990s and 2000s, including two for Will Smith (&quot;Will 2K&quot; and &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;) and one for Toni Braxton (&quot;You&#x27;re Makin&#x27; Me High&quot;). In 2012, Campbell starred in Mindless Behavior&#x27;s music video for &quot;Hello&quot;.

On September 21, 2015, she released the single, &quot;Steel Here&quot;. On February 24, 2016, Campbell released the single, &quot;Lazy Bitch&quot;, as well as an accompanying video, where she featured her friend, Tasha Smith. On February 2, 2018, Campbell released the single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be Alone Tonight&quot;. On October 6, 2019, she released the single, &quot;22 Summers,&quot; with an accompanying video.

===Philanthropy===
In 2011, Campbell co-founded Colored My Mind, a non-profit foundation dedicated to raising awareness of childhood autism in communities of color. She was inspired to start the organization by her son Xen, who was diagnosed with autism when he was 18 months old.

==Personal life==
On August 17, 1996, Campbell married actor Duane Martin. Together, they have two sons. In February 2018, Campbell filed for divorce after 21 years of marriage. The couple finalized their divorce in December 2020.

In November 1996, Campbell left the Fox series &quot;Martin&quot; during its final season, citing &quot;intolerable&quot; working conditions. In January 1997, Campbell filed a lawsuit against co-star Martin Lawrence on the counts of sexual harassment and abuse both on and off set. By April 1997, Campbell had settled the lawsuit, and returned to appear in the last two episodes of the series. Campbell and Lawrence have both stated that they have since reconciled.

<text>Air Chief Marshal Sir Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham, (18 September 1878 – 20 October 1953) was a senior commander in the Royal Air Force. During the First World War he served in the Royal Flying Corps as a wing commander and senior staff officer. Remaining in the new Royal Air Force (RAF) after the war, Brooke-Popham was the first commandant of its Staff College at Andover and later held high command in the Middle East. He was Governor of Kenya in the late 1930s. Most notably, Brooke-Popham was Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command until being replaced a few weeks before Singapore fell to Japanese troops.

==Family life and education==

Brooke-Popham was born in England in the Suffolk village of Mendlesham on 18 September 1878. His parents were Henry Brooke, a country gentleman of Wetheringsett Manor in Suffolk, and his wife Dulcibella who was the daughter of Robert Moore, a clergyman.

Brooke-Popham&#x27;s education was not atypical of a man entering the British officer class. He attended South Lodge School in Lowestoft from 1885 to 1891. After his school years at Haileybury and his officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the British Army in 1898. In January 1926, Brooke-Popham married Opal Mary, the daughter of Edgar Hugonin. They later had a son and a daughter.

==Early military career==
After graduating from Sandhurst in May 1898, Brooke-Popham was gazetted to the Oxfordshire Light Infantry in the rank of second lieutenant, and the following year promoted to lieutenant on 24 November 1899. As a subaltern he saw active service in the Second Boer War during 1899 and 1900 and on 26 April 1902 he was seconded for further duty in South Africa. 

During his time there he served in the Orange Free State, the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, and Cape Colony. He was promoted captain on 9 November 1904. By 1910 Brooke-Popham had returned to Great Britain. From 22 January 1910, he attended the Army Staff College at Camberley.

==Military aviation before the First World War==

Brooke-Popham was attached to Air Battalion Royal Engineers during its manoeuvres of 1911, after which he decided to learn to fly. He attended the flying school at Brooklands and gained Royal Aero Club certificate number 108 in July 1911. He returned to his regiment, the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, on 28 February 1912. 

However, in early 1912, he transferred to the Air Battalion, taking up duties as a pilot in March. The next month, he was appointed Officer Commanding of the Battalion&#x27;s Aeroplane Company.

With the creation of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) from the Air Battalion on 13 May 1912, Brooke-Popham was transferred to the RFC. He was appointed the first Officer Commanding of No. 3 Squadron. In a letter to the editor of &quot;Flight&quot; magazine, dated 23 January 1949, he wrote, &quot;I see from an old log book that though I was seconded to the Air Battalion at the end of March 1912, it was not till the 6th May that I flew to Larkhill to take over command of No.2 (Aeroplane) Co.&quot; No. 3 Squadron was the successor unit to the Air Battalion&#x27;s No. 2 (Aeroplane) Company which had been stationed at Larkhill, on Salisbury Plain, since its creation in April 1911 and thus became the oldest British, Empire or Commonwealth independent military unit to operate heavier-than-air machines.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the First World War, Brooke-Popham went to France as the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-General in the headquarters of the Royal Flying Corps, where he was responsible for the administrative and technical support to the squadrons deployed in the field. His understanding of the importance of air power and its support to land forces led him to criticize the lack of adequate air support to the British Expeditionary Force.

On 20 November 1914 Brooke-Popham was appointed Officer Commanding No. 3 Wing of the RFC. At this time the wing consisted of No. 1 and No. 4 squadrons, and on the same day as his appointment, Brooke-Popham received a temporary promotion to lieutenant colonel. 

During the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, Brooke-Popham directed his Wing&#x27;s operations and was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his part in the Battle.

By 1915, Brooke-Popham was too senior an officer to take part in much operational flying, and he also had limited experience of air combat. Rather, his energies were directed into administrative and organizational activities, as he served in several staff posts at the RFC&#x27;s headquarters in France. In May 1915 Brooke-Popham was appointed the RFC&#x27;s Chief Staff Officer, and in March 1916 he was the Corps&#x27; Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General, which saw him granted the temporary rank of brigadier-general.

In 1915, the capabilities of radio were still very limited. Observers in aircraft could not easily communicate with men on the ground. Men on the ground could not easily reply. In 1915, a technique was developed whereby troops on the ground could send messages to aviators by laying strips of white cloth on the ground. These strips are referred to as &quot;Popham strips&quot; in a novel set in the period.

With the establishment of the Royal Air Force in April 1918, Brooke-Popham was transferred to the newly created Air Ministry in London. He served as the Controller of Aircraft Production for the remainder of the War and for some months afterwards. In 1919, he served as Director of Aircraft Research.

Developed during the First World War, the Popham panel was named for him.

==RAF service during the inter-war years==
===Post-war honours===
Following the end of the First World War, Brooke-Popham was decorated for his contributions to the war effort. In January 1919 he was awarded the Air Force Cross and made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Later in the same year he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and was given a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force as a colonel. He was rapidly promoted to air commodore when the Air Force introduced its own rank system in August 1919.

===Career progression===

From 1919 to 1921, Brooke-Popham served as Director of Research at the Air Ministry and in November 1921 he was tasked with establishing the RAF Staff College at Andover and he became its first commandant on 1 April 1922.

In 1925 the Air Defence of Great Britain had been created and it was charged with defending the United Kingdom from aerial attack. The following year, Brooke-Popham was posted as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) the Fighting Area within the Air Defence of Great Britain and he served in this capacity for the next two years. During his time as AOC Fighting Area, Brooke-Popham oversaw the establishment of a chain of huge concrete mirrors which were designed for acoustic early warning and he received a knighthood in 1927.

On 1 November 1928, Brooke-Popham was appointed AOC Iraq Command. This high-profile position put him in charge of all British forces in Iraq and, when the post of high commissioner was vacant, he acted in that capacity as well. In late 1928, he mobilised and despatched the Victoria aircraft for the rescue of British embassy staff and others in the Kabul evacuation by air operation.

The start of 1931 saw Brooke-Popham promoted to air marshal and then posted as the first RAF officer to serve as Commandant of the Imperial Defence College. Two years later in 1933, he returned to the Air Defence of Great Britain, this time in the senior post of Air Officer Commander-in-Chief. Later that year Brooke-Popham received the honorary appointment of Principal Aide-de-Camp to the King. In 1935 he left the Air Defence of Great Britain to become the Inspector-General of the RAF. This was, however, a short-lived appointment and he was posted later that year.

===Commander-in-Chief RAF Middle East===
In late 1935, Brooke-Popham took up the post of Air Officer Commander-in-Chief RAF Middle East with his headquarters in Cairo. His appointment took place not long after the outbreak of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in October 1935 and his principal aim was to deter the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; from attacking British territory in north east Africa. In 1937, Brooke-Popham relinquished his command and returned to Great Britain, retiring from the RAF on 6 March.

==Private life==
In Q2 1926 in Tadcaster, he married Opal Mary Hugonin (16 Oct 1900 - Q2 1983). 
They had two children, Diana M in Q4 1926 in Marylebone and Francis P in Q3 1928 in Uxbridge.

In Q1 1948 in Westminster Diana married Robert H H Barton, and they had Margaret H, born Q4 1948 in Ploughley, Francis C H born Q3 1951 in Halstead, and Joanna M H , born Q4 1953 in Oxford.

In Q1 1957 in Greenwich, Francis married Susan C Fry; they had three daughters, Jane E in Q1 1960 in Gosport, Catherine A in Q1 1962 in Portsmouth and MARY L in Q3 1964 in Islington.
In 1986 in Taunton, he married Diana J Michael.

==Governor of Kenya==
Following Italy&#x27;s occupation of Ethiopia, the British Government wanted a military man to hold the post of Governor of Kenya. Brooke-Popham was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Kenya in 1937 and his military expertise was useful in helping the colony prepare for a possible war with Italy. Under his direction, a plan was devised which concentrated defensive resources on the strategically important port of Mombasa, which was judged to be the most likely Italian target. Although this left Nairobi and the highlands with only limited defences, the barren regions of northern Kenya meant that the inland settlements were geographically protected from the Italian threat further to the north. Eventually, as the Italian occupation of Ethiopia was characterized by strife and unrest, the threat to Kenya dissipated.

Brooke-Popham&#x27;s governorship was also marked by improved relations with the settlers. His predecessor had sought to dominate the political and economic life of the colony which had aroused repeated opposition from some of the settlers&#x27; leaders. However, in courting settler opinion, some historians have criticized Brooke-Popham for failing to deal with those settlers who wanted to limit African and Asian freedoms in Kenya.

In 1939 on the outbreak of the Second World War, Brooke-Popham ordered the internment of all Germans in Kenya, directed that all aircraft be commandeered, and devised a plan to keep the colony&#x27;s farms running. On 30 September 1939 he relinquished the governorship and returned to Britain.

==Second World War==
===Commonwealth Air Training Plan===
Brooke-Popham rejoined the RAF shortly after his return to Great Britain and only weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War. He was first appointed as head of the RAF&#x27;s training mission to Canada where he worked on the establishment of the Commonwealth Air Training Plan. In 1940 Brooke-Popham was made head of the training mission to South Africa where he continued work on the Plan.

===Commander-in-Chief Far East Command===
====Command arrangements====
On 18 November 1940, at the age of 62, Brooke-Popham was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command making him responsible for defence matters in Singapore, Malaya, Burma and Hong Kong. This was a considerably more demanding undertaking than any of Brooke-Popham&#x27;s many previous appointments. The Command was new and Brooke-Popham was the first RAF officer to be appointed Commander-in-Chief of a joint command during a world war. 

There was a significant gap between the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s responsibility and his authority, as Brooke-Popham was nominally responsible for all defence matters in the British Far East colonies but the Royal Navy units in these waters did not come under his command; rather they reported to their own naval commander-in-chief in London. The civil servants in the Far East also did not report to the Commander-in-Chief, working instead for ministers in London.

====Insufficient defences====

With the Japanese threatening south-east Asia, Brooke-Popham knew he had to build up the defences of the region. Those defences which already existed were primarily directed towards an attack from the sea and everywhere sufficient forces were lacking. The Command&#x27;s aerial defences were particularly deficient and the priority attached to operations in the Middle East meant that British resources were directed elsewhere. During the following year, Brooke-Popham struggled without much success to build up defences, get the much-needed reinforcements and rectify the unsound command arrangements.

====Operation &quot;Matador&quot;====

In August 1941 Brooke-Popham submitted a plan for the defence of Malaya to London for approval. This plan, code-named &quot;Matador&quot;, worked on the basis that the Japanese would land on the east coast of Thailand and then advance south. The essence of Operation &quot;Matador&quot; was that Allied forces would advance into Thailand and fight the Japanese there. The plan relied upon force levels not available to Brooke-Popham and involved violating the neutrality of Thailand, with whom a non-aggression pact had been signed the previous year. Concern regarding the situation prompted the government in London to send Duff Cooper as a special cabinet envoy. Cooper&#x27;s arrival in September 1941, did not help to maintain Brooke-Popham&#x27;s authority in a difficult situation.

On 22 November, with the Japanese establishing sea and air bases in southern Indo-China, Brooke-Popham urged London that Matador should be put into effect, granting him permission to advance into southern Thailand. Brooke-Popham did eventually receive permission on 5 December although many conditions were attached. The plan was reworked to take account of the limited forces available and on 8 December the war with Japan began. Two days before the Malayan Campaign began, Hudsons of No.1 Squadron (RAAF) spotted the Japanese invasion fleet but given uncertainty about the ships&#x27; destination and instructions to avoid offensive operations until attacks were made against friendly territory, Brooke-Popham did not allow the convoy to be bombed.

Although it had been agreed in London that Brooke-Popham should be replaced as commander-in-chief on 1 November 1941, the change was not made because of the critical situation. With the war with Japan now unfolding, many believed that Brooke-Popham was near to a nervous collapse. The cabinet envoy Duff Cooper urged his replacement and London agreed. On 27 December, at the height of the Battle of Malaya, Brooke-Popham handed over command to Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pownall. Brooke-Popham&#x27;s return to Britain was closely followed by the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942. Inevitably, Brooke-Popham was associated with the collapse and he was publicly attacked by some in Britain as the man chiefly responsible for the defeat.

===Later war years===
In May 1942, Brooke-Popham retired from active service in the RAF for the second time. His reputation severely damaged by the events in the Far East, he nevertheless continued to serve where he could. At some stage in 1942, Brooke-Popham became Inspector-General of the Air Training Corps, a position he held until 1945. From 1944 to 1946, he served as President of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes Council.

==Later years==
After Brooke-Popham relinquished his role as President of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes Council, he lived in retirement. Brooke-Popham died in the hospital at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire on 20 October 1953. His funeral took place at St. Edburg&#x27;s Church in Bicester and he was buried privately in Somerset.

==Papers==
Papers relating to Brooke-Popham&#x27;s service are held in the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King&#x27;s College London.

<doc id="1034274" wikidata="Q255347" url="?curid=1034274" title="Alexine Tinne">
<text>Alexandrine &quot;Alexine&quot; Pieternella Françoise Tinne (17 October 1835 – 1 August 1869) was a Dutch explorer in Africa who was the first European woman to attempt to cross the Sahara. She was an early photographer.

== Early life ==
Alexine Tinne was the daughter of Philip Frederik Tinne and his second wife, Baroness Henriette van Capellen. Philip Tinne was a Dutch merchant, who was heavily involved in the transatlantic spice trade. He worked at coffee plantations in Demerara (a Dutch and then British colony in modern Guyana). In 1813, Philip Tinne became a full partner in the Liverpool firm Sandbach, Tinne &amp; Company, a firm which from 1782 until the 1920s, owned ships and plantations, engaging in both slavery and the transport of slaves and sugar. Philip Tinne settled in England during the Napoleonic Wars and later returned to his native land, marrying Henriette, daughter of a Dutch Vice-Admiral, Theodorus Frederik van Capellen, and Petronella de Lange, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Sofia. Alexine was born when Philip was sixty-three.
Tinne was tutored at home and showed proficiency at painting, piano, languages, photography and geography. Her father died when she was ten years old. The immense wealth of her father, much of which was amassed due to his activities in the spice and sugar trade (when slavery was abolished in 1833, his company was awarded £150,452, the second-largest payment made to any mercantile concern), resulted in the young girl becoming the richest female in the Netherlands.

Tinne started experimenting with photography in her home town of The Hague and its harbour Scheveningen. She worked with several commercial photographers: Robert Jefferson Bingham (who visited The Hague), Francis Frith (whom she met in Egypt) and the J. Geiser photostudio in Algiers.

== Africa ==
Accompanied by her mother Harriette and her aunt, Tinne left Europe in the summer of 1861 for the White Nile region. After a short stay at Khartoum, the party traveled up the White Nile and became the first European women to reach Gondokoro. She fell ill and they were forced to return, reaching Khartoum on 20 November. Directly after their return, Theodor von Heuglin and Hermann Steudner met the Tinnes and the four of them planned to travel to the Bahr-el-Ghazal, a tributary of the White Nile, to reach the countries of the &#x27;Niam-Niam&#x27; (Azande). Heuglin and Steudner left Khartoum on 25 January, ahead of the rest of the expedition; the Tinnes following on 5 February. Heuglin also had geographical exploration in mind, intending to explore the uncharted region beyond the river and to ascertain how far westward the Nile basin extended. He also intended to investigate the reports of a vast lake in Central Africa eastwards of those already known, most likely the lake-like expanses of the middle Congo.

Ascending the Bahr-el-Ghazal, the limit of navigation was reached on 10 March. From Mishra-er-Rek, a journey was made overland, across the Bahr Jur and south-west by the Bahr Kosango to Jebel Kosango, on the borders of the Niam-Niam country. During the journey, all of the travellers suffered severely from fever. A student died in April and Tinne&#x27;s mother in July, followed by two Dutch maids. After much travel and dangers, the remainder of the party reached Khartoum at the end of March 1864, when Tinne&#x27;s aunt, who had stayed in Khartoum, died. Tinne buried her aunt and one maid and brought the corpse of her mother and the other maid back to Cairo. John Tinne, her half-brother from Liverpool, visited in January–February 1865, with the intention of persuading her to return home with him. Tinne was not to be persuaded and John left with the two corpses and a large part of her ethnographic collection. Her mother&#x27;s body later was buried at the Oud Eik en Duinen Cemetery in The Hague. Tinne&#x27;s ethnographic collection was donated by John to the Public Museum (now the Liverpool World Museum). 

Tinne successfully photographed during her 1862–1864 trip up the Nile and in the Bahr-el-Ghazal region, making her the author of the first known views of Gondokoro (1862), as well as of inhabitants of the areas explored. The extreme rarity of these photographs led them to be used as models for engravings illustrating several articles and books on these regions in the 1860s and 1870s.

Her botanical collections were described in a book entitled &quot;Plantae Tinneanae&quot;. It included the description of the new genus &quot;Blastania&quot;. &quot;Crinum tinneanum&quot; [&quot;Amaryllidaceae&quot;; present name &quot;Ammocharis tinneana&quot; ] was named in her honour.

At Cairo, Tinne lived in Oriental style during the next four years, visiting Algeria, Tunisia, and other parts of the Mediterranean. An attempt to reach the Touaregs in 1868 from Algiers failed.

== Some photographs by Alexine Tinne ==
== Sahara and death==

In January 1869, Tinne again made an attempt to reach the Touaregs. She started from Tripoli with a caravan, with the intention of traveling to Lake Chad, followed by Wadai, Darfur and Kordofan before reaching the upper Nile. In Murzuq, she met the German explorer Gustav Nachtigal, with whom she intended to cross the desert. As Nachtigal wanted to go to the Tibesti Mountains first, she set out for the South on her own. Her caravan advanced slowly. Due to her diseases (attacks of gout and inflammation of her eyes), she was not able to maintain order in her group.

In the early morning of 1 August, on the route from Murzuk to Ghat, she was murdered together with two Dutch sailors in her party, allegedly by Tuareg people in league with her escort. According to statements at the trial in Tripoli in December 1869–January 1870, two blows of a sword — one in her neck, one on one of her hands — made her collapse. They left her to bleed to death.

There are several theories as to the motive, none of them proven. One is that her guides believed that her iron water tanks were filled with gold. It is also possible that her death came as a result of an internal political conflict between local Tuareg chiefs. Another explorer, Erwin von Bary, who visited the same area in the 1870s, met participants of the assault and learned that it had been a blow against the &quot;great old man&quot; of the Northern Tuaregs, Ikhenukhen, who was to be removed from his powerful position, and the means was to be the killing of the Christians — just to prove that Ikhenukhen was too weak to protect travelers. Given the internal strife among the Northern Tuareg that lasted until the Ottoman occupation of the Fezzan Province (Southern Libya), this version is the most probable explanation of the otherwise unmotivated massacre.

== Legacy ==
It was believed that Tinne&#x27;s collections of ethnographic specimens in Liverpool were destroyed in 1941 during a bombing raid. The church built in her memory in The Hague was similarly destroyed. Recent research revealed however that around 75% (over 100 objects) of her ethnographic collection survived the air raid. Besides their value as a document of her two Sudan journeys, her collection, together with the contemporary one of Heuglin at Stuttgart (the Linden Museum), represent rare specimens of an early date belonging to material cultures in Sudan.

A small marker near Juba in Sudan commemorating the Nile explorers of the 19th century bears Tinne&#x27;s name, as well as a window plaque in Tangiers. Many of her remaining papers, including most of her letters from Africa, are stored at the National Archive in The Hague. Her photographs are at the National Archive and the Municipal Archive of The Hague. 

In 2024 Leiden University Library acquired eighteen photos made by Tinne in 1862 in Nubia and Sudan, including in the village of Gondokoro. These are among the earliest images taken in the heart of the African continent.

<text>.cz is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Czech Republic administered by CZ.NIC. 

==History==
Until Czechoslovakia was dissolved in 1993, it used the domain &quot;.cs&quot;.The .cz domain came into effect in January 1993, following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

In 2009, new European Union legislation came into effect, allowing the use of diacritics in second-level domains under the .eu domain only. 

== Registration ==
The .cz domain, operated by the CZ.NIC association, continued to only offer standard characters, citing insufficient demand and lower accessibility from abroad as reasons behind their decision.

Czech customers were among the most interested in the new domains, only Germans bought more, with the French in third. 

Over 850,000 internet sites had been registered as .cz by the end of 2011. 

In 2012, the number exceeded one million. The Czech Republic was therefore the 12th European Union member state with a top-level domain to top a million active domain names.

At the end of 2011, CZ.NIC reported that ownership of all domains, 58% were by individuals, whereas those held by organisations accounted for a minority of 42%. Domains were most popular in Prague, followed by Brno and Ostrava.

=== Requirements ===
Registrations must be ordered via accredited domain name registrars.

The maximum domain name length permitted is 63 characters, which may only be alphanumeric or the hyphen (-). 

Hyphens are restricted in that they may not be the first or last character, neither may they appear consecutively. 

As of 2013, there are six domains which use the maximum of 63 characters.

<text>Catherine Stenbock (Swedish: &quot;Katarina Gustavsdotter Stenbock&quot;; 22 July 1535 – 13 December 1621) was Queen of Sweden from 1552 to 1560 as the third and last wife of King Gustav I.

== Early life ==
Catherine Stenbock was born on 22 July 1535 in Torpa Castle, Sweden. She was the daughter of Riksråd Gustaf Olofsson Stenbock and Brita Eriksdotter Leijonhufvud, who was the sister of King Gustav&#x27;s previous consort Margaret Leijonhufvud. She was thus the maternal niece of Queen Margaret and first cousin of the royal children of that marriage, including future kings John III of Sweden and Charles IX of Sweden. Her siblings included Ebba Stenbock.

There is little information about her prior to her marriage. It is possible that she served as maid of honor to her aunt, the Queen, but either way, she was most certainly known to the King personally: due to the marriage of her aunt, her family belonged to the relations to the King named as &quot;Kungafränderna&quot; (`The King&#x27;s Relations´), who played an important role at court, and participated in the family events of the monarch, as well as he was present at the weddings and other events of her family. Her parents were both favored by the monarch. Their marriage was hosted by the King in parallel to his own first marriage in 1531, her father founded his career as a riksråd upon his loyalty to the King, and her mother was in the King&#x27;s confidence: it was said that &quot;In her [Queen Margaret&#x27;s] sister Bridget... he always had much trust&quot;. Upon the death of her aunt Queen Margaret in 1551, Catherine&#x27;s mother Brita and aunt Martha Leijonhufvud, in succession to Christina Gyllenstierna, were entrusted the care of the royal children until the King married again, which he was expected to do.

The King declared that a new marriage was necessary foremost because he needed a Queen for his court and a mother for his young children. In March 1552, he called her mother, her aunt Martha and her spouse, and the King&#x27;s nephew Per Brahe the Elder who was married to Catherine&#x27;s sister Beata, and it thought that her proposed the marriage to her family at this meeting. Her family was favorable to the match, as this would preserve the family connection they had made with the King through his previous marriage with Queen Margaret, an influence they would keep through Catherine. The reason the King stated to marry Catherine was the great costs and the time-consuming negotiations necessary secure a marriage with a foreign princess in the complicated political climate in Europe during the ongoing religious conflicts. The marriage to Queen Margaret had secured the King a loyal support with the Swedish nobility for his rule, a useful alliance with he confirmed by marrying again in to the same family by marrying the niece of his late spouse. Catherine herself is described as an 155 cm long, dark blonde beauty with blue eyes.

According to tradition, like her aunt and predecessor Catherine was engaged when the King decided to marry her, to the noble Gustav Johansson Tre Rosor (His last name meaning Three Roses), and after the marriage to the King, he once heard her say in her sleep: &quot;King Gustav is very dear to me, but I shall never forget The Rose&quot;. When the King came to her parents manor Torpa to propose to her personally, as the law demanded that she give her personal consent, it is said that she ran away and hid behind a bush in the garden. Whether truthful or not, the King had his way.

There was, however, opposition among the church against a marriage between the King and the niece of his former spouse, and the arch bishop protested quoting the Books of Moses prohibiting the marriage between a man and the widow of his uncle, which was interpreted as the ban against marriage to the relations of a dead spouse. The King had a commission headed by Georg Norman prove that the Old Testament applied only to Jews and that, in any case, it allowed for a man to marry the sister of his dead wife and thereby a marriage to the niece of his wife must be permitted. The King also had his royal council confirm to the church that the King married upon their request out of the need for a Queen rather than for an infatuation and that he had the right to marry whom he choose, after which the church agreed to the marriage.

== Queen ==
The marriage was conducted in the chapel of the Vadstena Abbey 22 August 1552, followed by the coronation of Catherine as Queen the following day. She was dressed in a golden dress during the wedding, and a silver one during her coronation, escorted, as was Queen Margaret during official ceremonies, by her male relatives. The wedding was surrounded what was seen as bad omens: the plague swept through parts of the nation, the city of Turku burned down, and people claimed to see bad omens and evil signs in the sky. The celebrations lasted for three days. When the court departed, the city of Vadstena burned down in a great fire, which was seen as another bad omen.

There is little information of Catherine Stenbock as Queen. As such, she was, with the assistance of her head lady-in-waiting Anna Hogenskild, made responsible to supervise the female courtiers and her cousins, the royal children; in the case of the princesses, until they married, and in the case of the princes, until they were no longer children. It seems as if her relationship to her royal stepchildren was a good one, with the exception of Duke Charles. 
Her private relationship to the King is not much mentioned, and it has been said that she: &quot;Accepted her part as Queen of Sweden with silent dignity&quot; and without attracting too much personal attention. It is said, however, that the King did find their age difference too great and contemplated writing a law which would prevent any future marriage between: &quot;Two people, of which one was young and one was old&quot;. 
As Queen, she was expected by her family to replace her aunt Queen Margaret in the role of acting as a loyal as a channel between her family and the King, preserving the influence of her family, a task she obediently fulfilled: in 1556, for example, she was asked by her aunt Martha Leijonhufvud of a document from the King regarding the rights to Läckö fief, a task she performed successfully. There are no information that she ever involved herself in any personal political agenda of any kind. One of the few incidents mentioned of her during her tenure as Queen was during the conflict between the young courtier Hogenskild Bielke and her brothers Erik and Olof, in which Bielke accused Olof and Erik of using their positions as brothers of the Queen to terrorize the other young male courtiers while being protected by Catherine. Her stepson John&#x27;s lover Karin Hansdotter originally belonged to her court.

In 1554 and in 1556, there were signs that she was pregnant, but no pregnancy was ever officially announced and none was ever confirmed. In 1555, she and the royal children accompanied the King to the province of Finland, where they stayed until 1556. During their stay on Åland, where they spend the winter upon their return after their visit to Finland, Catherine was affected by &quot;Sudden motherly problems&quot;, which has been interpreted as a miscarriage, which is the closest information available of a pregnancy of Catherine Stenbock.

In Stockholm on 1 October 1559, she was present at the wedding between her stepdaughter Princess Catherine and Edzard II, Count of East Frisia. On their departure from Sweden, the newly weds was accompanied by the sister of the bride and the brother of the groom, Princess Cecilia of Sweden and Johan II of East Frisia. On their stay in Vadstena, Cecilia and Johan were discovered by Crown Prince Eric to have a sexual affair. The great scandal were to be known as &quot;Vadstenabullret&quot; (Vadstena Rumble). Catherine and Edzard were placed in house arrest, Johan were imprisoned, while Eric and Cecilia where both called back to Stockholm. The King is said to have cried when he related the story to Queen Catherine. During the whole affair, Catherine Stenbock was on numerous occasions asked to act as mediator between the King and his children. She accompanied Cecilia to her confrontation with her father after her return to the capital, and she acted as channel through the King for Princess Catherine, who tried to negotiate Johan&#x27;s release and permission for her and her spouse to leave for East Frisia. In May 1560, Prince Eric asked her for a permission from his father to travel to England to propose to Elizabeth I of England.

King Gustav fell sick and died during the scandal. According to the chronicles, Catherine was present by his bedside during his entire sickness until death, had a bed brought in by his side where she slept, and eventually fell sick herself. She continued to act as mediator between the King and his children, and upon his complaints that they were not there, answer that they would have been, and wished to, had they not been so afraid for his anger.

== Reign of Eric XIV ==
King Gustav died on 29 September 1560 and was succeeded by his son in his first marriage, Eric XIV. In his will, Catherine was promised custody of the Princesses, who were to live at the court of Eric or her until they married, an allowance suitable for her position, and that his sons should always see to it that she had her needs taken care of. He did not specify which estates should be given to her in his will, but prior to his death, he had his two eldest sons Eric and John promise to grant her preferred choice, Strömsholm. In March, Catherine had Eric XIV issue a written statement of her right to Strömsholm, which remained her seat for the rest of her life, as well as several other lands and parishes in Sudermannia, as well as her own residence in the capital. The mother of the new King&#x27;s infamous adviser Jöran Persson, Anna, was the house keeper of the Queen Dowager&#x27;s court at Strömsholm.

Catherine Stenbock remained a widow for 61 years, and despite participating in various kinds of ceremonies, she dressed in mourning for the rest of her life. She was the first Swedish Queen Dowager referred to by the title &quot;Riksänkedrottning&quot; (Queen Dowager of the Realm). 
During most of the reign of Eric XIV, the King was unmarried, and Queen Dowager Catherine ceremoniously functioned as the first lady of the royal court. In 1562, for example, she and the King opened a ball given in honor of the Polish embassy sent to negotiate the wedding between the King&#x27;s brother Prince John and the Polish Princess Catherine Jagellon.

Queen Dowager Catherine seems to have had a good relationship to Eric XIV, who normally treated her with respect, referred to her as &quot;My Dear Stepmother&quot; and trusted her on certain critical occasions. During the conflict between the King and his brother Prince John, when the King had John imprisoned with his spouse, Catherine offered her assistance as mediator, but was refused by Eric who accused her of siding with John and reminded her that King Gustav had asked them all to show loyalty to his successor.

Catherine was given an important role in connection to the infamous Sture Murders. In the spring of 1567, the King had several noblemen imprisoned and taken to Uppsala, accused of treason. Among them were brother of Catherine, Abraham Gustafsson Stenbock; the spouse of her aunt Martha Leijonhufvud, Svante Sture; and her two cousins, Nils Svantesson Sture and Erik Svantesson Sture, and her uncle Sten Eriksson Leijonhufvud. On 24 May, the King had a fit of insanity and killed Nils Svantesson Sture, after which he had her other relatives, with the exception of Sten Eriksson Leijonhufvud, as well as another nobleman, killed. After this, the King left Uppsala. He was found some days later outside the city in a severe state, and taken to the capital, where he was left in the care of Karin Månsdotter. Catherine arrived to Uppsala the day of the murders. She was contacted by a delegation from the King headed by her uncle Sten Leijonhufvud and Hogenskild Bielke, recently also kept prisoners by the King, and asked to act as mediator between the King and the relatives of the murder victims. They escorted her to the capital, where she was given an audience with the King. This was to be the first audience with the King since the murders, and the royal court awaited her arrival, as no one had dared to come in the Kings presence since the Sture murders. When she entered the audience room, the King reportedly fell down on his knees before her and asked forgiveness for the murders. He gave her a written document giving her the authority to negotiate the settlement with the relatives of the murder victims, among them her aunt Martha Leijonhufvud. Through Catherine, Martha Leijonhufvud put forward her demands of a letter of protection against further persecution of the King; an official statement of the innocence of the murder victims; economic compensation and the arrest of the people truly responsible for the behavior of the monarch, which was regarded to be his adviser Jöran Persson. The King accepted all terms of the settlement, though he soon reinstated Persson.

During the illness and convalescence of the King, the Kingdom was ruled by a regency council including the uncles of Catherine, Per Brahe the Elder and Sten Leijonhufvud. During this period, Catherine made several visits to the imprisoned brother of the King, Prince John in Uppsala. She was also present when Eric XIV visited his brother in October and in his confusion asked him if he was the King or not. She managed to arrange a form of reconciliation between the brothers, and had Prince John moved to Arboga, where he was guarded less strictly. Catherine is given credit for contributing to the recovery of the King&#x27;s sanity later in that year.

On 9 June 1568, Catherine was made god mother of the King&#x27;s son by Karin Månsdotter, and carried him to his baptism. On 4 July 1568, she participated in the double wedding between the King and Karin Månsdotter and the Princess Sophia and Magnus II of Saxe-Lauenburg. In the procession to church, the Queen Dowager escorted the King&#x27;s bride, while the second bride, the King&#x27;s sister Princess Sophia, followed secondly with Princess Elizabeth, which was regarded an insult in matter of rank, as the marriage between the King and the commoner was regarded a scandal which was boycotted by the Dukes, the brothers of the King. There were reports, that the King had plans to have his brothers, as well as other enemies invited to the wedding, killed during the celebrations, but that the plans failed because Månsdotter warned the intended victims through Queen Dowager Catherine. According to another version, Catherine did so on her own initiative.

During the rebellion of the Dukes, the King&#x27;s brothers, which erupted after the controversial marriage of the King and ended in the dethronement of King Eric XIV that same year, Catherine and her stepdaughters, the Princesses Sophia and Elizabeth, were with the King in the capital. According to the official statement given by Prince John after the deposition in 1569, they were placed under guard, prevented from leaving and placed under the threat of being presented to Tsar Ivan the Terrible of Russia as hostages. Eric XIV had made an alliance with Russia against Poland, and the Tsar had presented the demand that he should give him his Polish sister-in-law, the spouse of Prince John, Princess Catherine Jagellon, as hostage to use against Poland, and a Russian embassy was at the time waiting in Stockholm to bring Catherine Jagellon to Russia. Eric XIV felt forced to decline this demand because of international pressure, but had offered to replace his Polish sister-in-law with his stepmother and his two sisters. According to John, the relationship between the King and the Queen Dowager was bad at this point, as he had accused her of having financed the Danes during the ongoing Northern Seven Years&#x27; War and threatened not only to give her, his sisters and their ladies-in-waiting over to the Russians but also to burn them alive. 

It is unclear how much of this is true and what is propaganda from the later John III to excuse the deposition of his brother, but what ever the case, Queen Dowager Catherine and Princesses Sophia and Elizabeth left the court and escaped to join the rebellious Dukes after having been given a threat of some kind by the King, likely when they were told of their planned Russian captivity. One version said that they were permitted to take a boat trip and continued until the other shore, and another one that they took a walk in the town and continued to the city gate: in any case, when they had left town, they were joined by the spouse of Princess Sophia, Magnus II of Saxe-Lauenburg, who had been sent by the King to pursue his brothers, but who instead took the Queen Dowager and the Princesses to join the rebels. When Eric XIV was forced to extradite his adviser Jöran Persson, it is possible that Catherine had a say in his fate: many decades later, she was threatened by the son of Persson, who blamed her for his father&#x27;s death. Around this time, the French ambassador Charles de Dancay described the queen dowager Catherine as &quot;a beautiful woman in her mid 30s&quot;.

During the following imprisonment of Eric XIV and Karin, their children were placed in the custody of Catherine Stenbock and their French governess Johanna (Jeanne) de Herboville from 1568 until 1570. Eric XIV had a good relation to Catherine: even after having been attacked by her brother Olof in prison, he gave her the credit for not having been put to death after his dethronement.

== Reign of John III==
After the succession of John III to the throne, her lands were questioned by her youngest stepson Duke Charles, as they were situated in his Duchy. All her fiefs in Södermanland were exchanged for Åland, which was a very favorable exchange, as Åland gave a much larger income than her previous lands. She had a good relationship with the King and often lent him money. Her estates made it possible for her to act as one of the foremost financiers of John III, particularly in his war with Russia, loans he was unable to pay her back. Her sole remaining estate in Södermanland were her main residence Strömsholm, which caused a conflict with Duke Charles. The Duke insisted that Strömsholm belonged to him because it was situated in his Duchy. He demanded that she evacuate the fief to him, sent armed troops to the area to prevent her from collecting taxes from the farmers of the area and threatened to attack the estate to remove her physically. The conflict escalated to this point prior to his marriage in 1579, because he wished to present Strömsholm as the residence of his bride. Catherine&#x27;s rights were protected by John III, who reminded Charles that although the King had not mentioned the estate in his will, he had asked the Princes to ensure the right of his widow to it verbally. The conflict, however, continued until 1582, when John III formally had the royal council declare a verdict in favor of Catherine in the matter and threaten Charles with the loss of his succession rights to the throne unless he respected the decision.

In 1570, Catherine had a wish to marry Duke Francis II of Saxe-Lauenburg, the brother-in-law of her stepdaughter Princess Sophia. These plans was however prevented by the spouse of Sophia, Magnus II of Saxe-Lauenburg. During the time of conflict between her and Duke Charles of the rights to Strömsholm (circa 1580), she received a proposal from a German Count Palatine, but declined the offer.

During the reign of John III, she no longer had such a prominent place at court, as the King was married. Because of her royal rank, she occupied a more and more dominant role in her own birth family, and often hosted family meetings and arranged family occasions such as weddings and funerals, and continued to act as a channel between her relatives and the royal house. In 1574, a scandal took place when her brother Erik Stenbock made his legendary elopement with their cousin, Malin Sture, daughter of her famous aunt Martha Leijonhufvud. The couple were in love, but had been forbidden to marry by Martha because they were cousins. Martha had the King imprison Erik, but Catherine and Duke Charles both acted as mediators, and managed to have Erik released and have their love marriage acknowledged within a year. In 1582, she participated in the meeting between Karin Månsdotter and Queen Catherine Jagellon at Svartsjö Castle.

Queen Catherine Stenbock, as well as Queen Gunilla Bielke, both acted as mediators during the conflict between the King and the Royal Council in 1589–90. During the conflict, John III suspected the Councillors of conspiring to depose him in favor of the son of Eric XIV. Catherine was informed that rumors circulated in which she was to have hosted a meeting for the Councillors at Strömsholm where they conspired to depose the King. She contacted the King and defended her against the accusations, and was never openly accused.

==Reign of Sigismund III Vasa==
In 1592, John III died and was succeeded by his son Sigismund III Vasa, the elected King of Poland, which was opposed by Duke Charles. Catherine participated in the burial of John III in 1594, and had her fiefs confirmed by Sigismund, with the right to appoint the officials in Åland. 

In 1595, civil war erupted between Sigismund and Duke Charles. Her brothers refused to join Duke Charles, who declared them, her brother-in-law Klaus Fleming, Governor of Finland, and her nephew as his enemies. Klaus Fleming had a new official appointed to her fief of Åland and used its supplies for Sigismund against Charles. This was likely done with the approval of Catherine, who had sent warnings about Charles to Fleming, but this could not be proven, even though Charles had one of Fleming&#x27;s men arrested and interrogated. In November 1597, Catherine&#x27;s fief Åland was confiscated by Charles on the ground of it having been used against him. The same year, after the warfare of Duke Charles toward the loyalists of Sigismund in Finland, Fleming was killed, and Catherine&#x27;s sister Ebba Stenbock and her daughters were taken captive by the Duke and imprisoned in Stockholm: the son of Ebba was killed during the Åbo Bloodbath in 1599. Several of the relatives of Queen Dowager Catherine remained loyal to Sigismund and fled to Poland. She visited Queen Christina to plead to the King through her in 1599. 

Duke Charles could prove nothing against Catherine herself, and her fief of Åland was eventually replaced by Drottningholm. Her residence of Strömsholm became a refuge for the abandoned wives and daughters of her male relatives, who fled to Sigismund in Poland and had their estates in Sweden confiscated, and she petitioned for the confiscated property to be returned to her female relations, sometimes eventually with success. Her sister Ebba and her daughters lived with her after they were released from prison in 1600. Among the female relations she received as maid of honor were Ebba Brahe in 1614, who was the removed from the employ of the mother of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to prevent a love match with the King, and whose wedding she hosted in 1618.

== Later life, death and legacy ==
Queen Dowager Catherine Stenbock spent her last years tending to her estates, engaging in iron works and other enterprises, and spending time with her relatives, especially her sisters. During her last years, she became periodically crippled, and was for this reason not able to attend the wedding of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1620.

She has been given a charitable reputation because she gave a safe haven to many female relations to the exiled loyalists of Sigismund, and because she often acted as a channel of the local peasantry and the royal house. 

She died on 13 December 1621, aged 86, at Strömsholm. 
Upon her death, it was said that: &quot;The poor have lost a friend, the orphans their mother&quot;. She was buried in Uppsala Cathedral, but without a monument of her own.

<text>Sir Francis Kynaston or Kinaston (1587–1642) was an English lawyer, courtier, poet and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1621 to 1622. He is noted for his translation of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; into Latin verse (as rime royal, &quot;Amorum Troili et Creseidae Libri Quinque&quot;, 1639). He also made a Latin translation of Henryson&#x27;s &quot;The Testament of Cresseid&quot;.

==Life==

Kynaston was born at Oteley Park, near Ellesmere, Shropshire, the eldest son of Sir Edward Kynaston and his wife Isobel Bagenal, daughter of Sir Nicholas Bagenal. His father was High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1599. On 11 December 1601 Kynaston matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford. He graduated B.A. from St Mary Hall on 14 June 1604 and M.A. at Oxford on 11 November 1611. He was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1611. He was knighted by James I at Theobalds on 21 December 1618.

In 1621 Kynaston was elected Member of Parliament for Shropshire. Believed to have been cupbearer to James I, he became esquire of the body by 1624 and continued to hold the post under Charles I until 1642.

At court Kynaston was the centre of a literary coterie. In 1635 he founded an academy of learning, called the Musæum Minervæ, for which he obtained a licence under the great seal, a grant of arms, and a common seal; Charles also contributed from the treasury. On 27 February 1636 Prince Charles, the Duke of York, and others visited the museum, and a masque by Kynaston, entitled &quot;Corona Minervæ,&quot; was performed in their presence. In July of the same year Sir George Peckham bequeathed money to the institution. At this time, Kynaston was living at Covent Garden in London. The Musaeum, which was beset by plagues in 1635 and 1637, financial difficulties and opposition from the universities and Inns of Court, closed by 1639. Its site was marked by Kynaston&#x27;s Alley, Bedfordbury.

Shortly after this, Kynaston was preoccupied with promoting a certain ‘hanging furnace,’ recommended by him to the lords of the admiralty for ships of war.

In 1642, at the beginning of the English Civil War, Kynaston was appointed a Commissioner of Array for Shropshire by the Royalist authorities but appears to have had no personal involvement or trouble. According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; he died, intestate during 1642 and was buried at Oteley (&quot;sic&quot;) but letters of administration for his estate were granted to his son Edward in 1649. 

Kynaston married, firstly, Margaret Lee, daughter of Sir Humphry Lee, 1st Baronet of Langley, in 1613. They had one son, Edward (c. 1613 – 1656), and four daughters - Frances (b. 1612), Rachel, Ann (d. 1642) and Barbara (d. 1619). Margaret died in 1623, following which he married Margaret, sister of Charles Mainwaring. The couple had no children and she survived Kynaston, dying in 1661.

==Works==

Kynaston published a translation of Chaucer&#x27;s ‘Troilus and Cressida,’ with a commentary, prefaced by fifteen short poems by Oxford writers, including William Strode and Dudley Digges (Oxford, 1635) which credited him with having rescued Chaucer&#x27;s work from the obscurity into which it had then fallen, making it understandable to readers in Kynaston&#x27;s day. Kynaston also contributed to the &quot;Musæ Aulicæ&quot; by Arthur Johnston, a rendering in English verse of Johnston&#x27;s Latin poems, London, 1635, and was author of an heroic romance in verse, &quot;Leoline and Sydanis&quot;, containing some of the legendary history of Wales and Anglesey, published with &quot;Cynthiades: Sonnets to his Mistresse&quot; (technically not precisely of the sonnet form) addressed by Kynaston to his mistress under the name of Cynthia (London, 1642).

<text>Ohio county government is the structure of official managerial and legal bodies of the counties of Ohio, USA. It is marked by a loose organization and a diffusion of power, the basic framework not having been changed since the nineteenth century. The Ohio Constitution allows counties to set up a charter government as many cities and villages do, but only Summit and Cuyahoga counties have done so. Counties operating under a constitutional government do not possess home rule powers and can do only what has been expressly authorized by the Ohio General Assembly. However, Article X of the Ohio Constitution gives county government benefits similar to those conferred on cities and villages under the home rule amendments of 1912.

==Officials==
Eighty-six of Ohio&#x27;s 88 counties (all except Summit as of 1981 and Cuyahoga as of 2011) have the following elected officials as provided by statute:

*Three county commissioners (the Board of Commissioners): Control budget; oversee planning and approve zoning regulations where county rural zoning is implemented; approve annexations to cities and villages; set overall policy; oversee departments under their control
*County auditor: Values property for taxation; issues dog, kennel, and cigarette licenses; issues licenses for retailers for sales tax purposes; inspects scales, fuel pumps, etc., used in commerce to see that they are accurate; maintains county accounting records and issues annual financial reports
*County clerk of court of common pleas: Keeps filings of lawsuits and orders of the county Court of Common Pleas, issues and records titles for motor vehicles
*County coroner: Determines causes of death in certain cases; is the only person with the power to arrest the sheriff.
*County engineer: Maintains county roads and land maps
*Prosecuting attorney: Prosecutes felonies and is the legal advisor to all other county officials and departments
*County recorder: Keeps all land records, including deeds, surveys, mortgages, easements, and liens
*County treasurer: Collects taxes, invests county money, provides financial oversight to municipalities and school districts in the county
*County sheriff: Chief law enforcement officer, polices areas without local police, runs the county jail, acts as officer of the local courts (transporting prisoners, serving subpoenas, acting as bailiff, etc.)

All of these officials are elected to four-year terms in November of even-numbered years after being nominated in partisan primary elections. One commissioner and the auditor are elected in the same year as the governor in one cycle; the other two commissioners and the other officials are elected in the same year as the president of the United States. The clerk, coroner, engineer, prosecutor, recorder, and sheriff begin their terms on the first Monday in January. The auditor&#x27;s term begins on the second Monday in March. The treasurer&#x27;s term begins on the first Monday in September. The commissioner who is elected with the governor begins his term on January 1. Of the other two seats, one term begins on January 2 and the second on January 3.

===Requirements to serve===
Any citizen of Ohio and the United States who is 18 years of age or older and lives in the county may run for commissioner, auditor, treasurer, clerk of courts, or recorder. The other offices have specific additional requirements: candidates for prosecutor must be licensed to practice law; candidates for coroner must be licensed to practice medicine for two years; candidates for engineer must be both licensed surveyors and engineers; and candidates for sheriff must have either a two-year college degree or five years of supervisory experience in law enforcement.

===Vacancies===
If a vacancy arises, it is filled by the county central committee of the political party to which the former official belonged, i.e., the Republicans appoint someone to an office held by a Republican and the Democrats to an office held by a Democrat. If an office becomes vacant before the November election in the even-numbered year midway through the term, the appointee must run in a special election for the remainder of the term. If the office becomes vacant after then, the appointment is for the remainder of the term.

===Board of County Commissioners===
The Board of County Commissioners is the combined executive and legislative branch of county government but as their control over the independently elected officials is limited, there is effectively no real executive. Though the commissioners receive a full-time salary, most commissioners have full-time occupations on the side and so many boards hire a county administrator to oversee the county&#x27;s day-to-day affairs. The board also employs a clerk to record its proceedings if it is deemed necessary to have a full-time clerk, otherwise the Auditor is &quot;ex officio&quot; the clerk. One of the members of the board is named president of the board.

The board of commissioners often create numerous subordinate departments to handle specific services. These vary from county to county; among the most common are departments for building and zoning, health, economic development, water and sewer service, and emergency management.

===Board of education===
There is also a county educational service center (previously known as the county board of education) presided over by a board of education, typically numbering five members, elected to staggered four-year terms in non-partisan elections in odd-numbered years. The center supplies services to the individual school districts in the county and exercises some limited control over the class of school districts known as &quot;local school districts.&quot; (&quot;City school districts&quot; and &quot;exempted village school districts&quot; are free from any oversight by the county board.) Some counties have combined their educational service centers with other counties&#x27;. Counties also have a board of mental retardation and developmental disabilities to educate disabled children. The members of the board are appointed.

==Elections==
Elections are administered in each county by a four-member board of elections which consists of two Republicans and two Democrats appointed by the Ohio Secretary of State at the recommendation of each county party. The board employs a director, who must be of the opposing political party of the chairman of the board of elections, and a deputy director, who must be of the political party of the chairman of the board.

==County courts==
Every county has a court of common pleas, which is the court of first instance for felonies and certain high-value civil cases. In many counties there are also municipal courts which operate in a defined territory and handle misdemeanors such as traffic tickets and smaller civil matters. Some counties also have one or more county courts, which handle the same cases as a municipal court but which occur outside the jurisdiction of a municipal court. In counties with large populations, the jurisdiction of the common pleas court may be divided into several specific departments, including a probate court (which handles wills, adoptions, and issues marriage licenses), a juvenile court, or a domestic relations court. All judges in Ohio are elected to six-year terms in non-partisan elections after being nominated in partisan primaries. County judges are elected in even-numbered years, municipal court judges in odd-numbered years.

<doc id="1034290" wikidata="Q177333" url="?curid=1034290" title="Buso Renkin">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki. It was serialized in publisher Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine from June 2003 to April 2005. The individual chapters were republished by Shueisha in ten (bound volumes). It follows Kazuki Muto, who becomes an alchemical warrior in the battle against alchemical monsters known as homunculi. Watsuki envisioned the manga as his last manga, and then he tried to do as much as he could with that genre. The series has been licensed by Viz Media for North American release.

The manga has been adapted into an anime television series, which was produced by studio Xebec and was broadcast on Japanese television network TV Tokyo from 2006 to 2007. In December 2007, the anime was announced for North American DVD release by Viz Media. In 2009, the series made its American television debut on the Funimation Channel, with American broadcast rights acquired by Funimation from Viz Media. The series has also spawned two drama CDs, two light novels, a PlayStation 2 video game, and many types of &quot;Buso Renkin&quot;-themed merchandise.

In Japan, the &quot;Buso Renkin&quot; manga has sold over 3 million volumes and was nominated for the science fiction works focused Seiun Award. It received a mixed reception from manga and anime publications. Watsuki&#x27;s art received the most positive comments from reviewers, while other aspects of the manga, such as its action and characters, have divided critics&#x27; opinions. The anime, which critics described as a generic fighting series, received mostly negative reception.

==Plot==

The narrative of &quot;Buso Renkin&quot; follows Kazuki Muto, who saves Tokiko Tsumura and is killed by an alchemical monster known as a homunculus. Tokiko, an alchemist warrior, feels responsible and revives him by replacing his destroyed heart with a . The kakugane is an alchemical device which, when activated, takes a weapon form based on its user&#x27;s personality, forming a buso renkinthe only thing that can destroy a homunculus. Kazuki creates his own buso renkin and joins Tokiko in the fight against the homunculi and their master, Koushaku Chouno. Chouno, who has renamed himself &quot;Papillon&quot;, is killed by Kazuki, but is later resurrected by the L.X.E., a humanoid homunculi group led by Chouno&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Bakushaku Chouno, now calling himself Dr. Butterfly. In various battles, Kazuki, Tokiko and Captain Bravo (their team leader) destroy most of the L.X.E.&#x27;s members. After learning that Dr. Butterfly believes him to be weak and useless, Papillon rebels against the L.X.E. and kills Dr. Butterfly.

Before his death, Dr. Butterfly drains the energy of the students at Kazuki&#x27;s school to heal and revive Victor, a being superior to humans and homunculi. Victor is confronted by Kazuki, but Victor is not interested in fighting and leaves. During the battle, however, Kazuki&#x27;s kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor&#x27;s—a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the philosopher&#x27;s stone. The black kakugane absorbs human life forces; to prevent this from happening, Kazuki&#x27;s death is ordered by the Alchemist Army. Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki, but Tokiko finds him alive. A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki&#x27;s death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former protégé of Tokiko&#x27;s) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki&#x27;s death is postponed because, as the Alchemists&#x27; leader explains, their top priority is to defeat Victor.

Kazuki and Tokiko find the white kakugane, which can negate the effects of the black kakugane and is guarded by Victor&#x27;s daughter Victoria, who is herself a humanoid homunculus. During the Alchemist Army&#x27;s final battle against Victor, Kazuki applies the white kakugane to Victor, but it only weakens him. To protect humankind from both of them, Kazuki propels himself and Victor to the moon. Later, Papillion creates a white kakugane to heal Kazuki. The Alchemist Army rescues Kazuki, creates another white kakugane and restores Victor&#x27;s humanity. Reunited with his daughter, Victor asks the Alchemist Army to turn him into a homunculus and tells them that he and his daughter will lead all the homunculi to the moon. The Alchemist Army dedicates itself to research a way to revert homunculi back into humans, ending their war activities. All Warriors abdicate their kakugane. Kazuki and Tokiko return to their daily lives together while Papillon becomes an urban legend throughout Japan.

==Production==

Nobuhiro Watsuki started writing &quot;Buso Renkin&quot; thinking it would be his last manga; he tried to do &quot;everything [he] ever wanted&quot; with that genre. He unexpectedly experienced problems drawing the manga&#x27;s fight scenes and said he &quot;struggled with the comedic elements&quot;. Watsuki drew references from several sources in &quot;Buso Renkin&quot;; from his past works &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; and &quot;Gun Blaze West&quot; to American comics, and from films to other anime and manga. Despite dealing with alchemy, Watsuki initially avoided mentioning the philosopher&#x27;s stone because he thought he could be accused of plagiarizing another series. He could not omit mentioning it, but he said that it is &quot;general knowledge&quot;. During the series&#x27; publication, Watsuki had four severe colds; the fourth cold made him so weak that he could not finish the chapter he was due to send to &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;.

==Manga==

The chapters of &quot;Buso Renkin&quot; were written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki and were serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from June 23, 2003, to April 25, 2005. The first 79 chapters were serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;; the final chapter was published in another magazine from Shueisha in two installments. Shueisha published the individual chapters in a series of ten (collected volumes), which were released between January 5, 2004, and April 4, 2006. 

In North America, Viz Media released the manga&#x27;s ten &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes between August 1, 2006, and February 5, 2008. In March 2012, Viz also made the manga available digitally through its Viz Manga App for the iPad and other iOS devices.

The manga has been licensed in Brazil by Editora JBC, France by Glénat, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in Italy by Panini Comics, and in Spain by Planeta DeLibros.

==Reception==
===Public response and awards===

In North America, the first volume has featured in the best-selling graphic novel ranking of Nielsen BookScan, and the fourth volume of the series was the seventh best-selling comic book of March 2007, according to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. In the same year, it was nominated for the Seiun Award for best science fiction comic title of the year.

===Critical response===
The manga&#x27;s critical reaction has been mixed. Most critics reached a consensus regarding the high quality of its art, describing it as &quot;crisp&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, and &quot;clean and well done&quot;. Other aspects of the series have divided critics&#x27; opinions. Manga Life&#x27;s Michael Aronson praised the enemy designs, while Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) criticized them, adding the series &quot;is not much fun to read, and certainly no fun to look at&quot;. Writing for Active Anime, Sandra Scholes found points of interest in the series&#x27; story, and praised its action. Santos said the action &quot;got all the drive and excitement of action&quot;, and Comic Book Bin&#x27;s Leroy Douresseaux called the series &quot;a mixture of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Naruto&quot;, but filled with even more weirdness&quot;.

Aronson said the storytelling and action needed &quot;clarity&quot;. Leigh Dragoon from Sequential Tart described &quot;Buso Renkin&quot; as &quot;derivative&quot; and &quot;hackneyed&quot;, and called the characters &quot;completely forgettable&quot;. Conversely, Patti Martinson writing for the same site said that they &quot;are distinctive and interesting&quot;. Martinson noted &quot;the complexity of the plot&quot;, though she said it is not difficult to follow. She added there was &quot;a lot of strong material&quot; that can be developed throughout the series. Holly Ellingwood praised the final volume, stating that Watsuki did &quot;a fabulous job of covering all fronts and the various characters, juggling them effectively&quot; and that it ends &quot;in an amazing way&quot;.

The anime was met with mostly negative critical reception. ANN critic Zac Bertschy said &quot;Buso Renkin&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t anything special&quot;, criticizing the &quot;threadbare plot exposition&quot; and its clichés, but praised the way it &quot;get[s] right to the action&quot;. Writing for ANN, Luke Carroll stated the series is generic and that it became &quot;[a] bit more tolerable ... during its light-hearted moments&quot;. Although ANN&#x27;s Carl Kimlinger said the anime follows the &quot; fighting formula&quot;, he praised Tokiko&#x27;s characterization, saying it is one characteristic that distinguish the series. Kimlinger also praised the way it &quot;improves considerably&quot; because of its twists in the plot. UK Anime Network&#x27;s Andy Hanley also called it &quot;generic&quot; at the start, but said it &quot;has a fairly decent stab&quot; in the second half. Chris Beveridge of Mania praised the balance between the humor and the &quot;lighter side&quot;, and stated that &quot;Buso Renkin&quot; &quot;took the clichés and obviousness of ideas and ran with it in an engaging and fun manner&quot;.

<doc id="1034291" wikidata="Q1154710" url="?curid=1034291" title="Soccer-specific stadium">
<text>A soccer-specific stadium, mainly in the United States and Canada, is a sports stadium either purpose-built or fundamentally redesigned for soccer and whose primary function is to host soccer matches, as opposed to a multi-purpose stadium which is for a variety of sports. A soccer-specific stadium may host other sporting events (such as lacrosse, American football and rugby) and concerts, but the design and purpose of a soccer-specific stadium is primarily for soccer. Some facilities (for example SeatGeek Stadium, Toyota Stadium and Historic Crew Stadium) have a permanent stage at one end of the stadium used for staging concerts.

A soccer-specific stadium typically has amenities, dimensions and scale suitable for soccer in North America, including a scoreboard, video screen, luxury suites and possibly a roof. The field dimensions are within the range found optimal by FIFA: long by wide. These soccer field dimensions are wider than the regulation American football field width of , or the width of a Canadian football field. The playing surface typically consists of grass as opposed to artificial turf, as the latter is generally disfavored for soccer matches since players are more susceptible to injuries. However, some soccer-specific stadiums, such as Portland&#x27;s Providence Park and Creighton University&#x27;s Morrison Stadium, do have artificial turf.

The seating capacity is generally between 18,000 and 30,000 for a Major League Soccer franchise, or smaller for college or minor league soccer teams. This is in comparison to the much larger American football stadiums that mostly range between 60,000 and 80,000 in which the original North American Soccer League teams played and most MLS teams occupied during the league&#x27;s inception. As opposed to gridiron-style football stadiums, where the front row of seats is elevated several feet above the field of play to allow spectators to see over the heads of substitute players and coaches on the sidelines, soccer-specific venues typically have the front row closer to the level of the pitch.

==History==

In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, first-division professional soccer leagues in the United States, such as the North American Soccer League and Major League Soccer, primarily used American football fields, many of which were oversized in terms of seating capacity and undersized in terms of the width of the soccer field; they often used artificial turf (none of which, at the time, were approved for international soccer under FIFA rules). Although many of the baseball parks had smaller capacities, natural grass, and a wider field, these parks were generally in use during summer, when North American–based soccer leagues, such as Major League Soccer, also hold their seasons, and the irregular field dimensions and sightlines were often considered undesirable.

Soccer-specific stadiums first came into use in the 1990s, after the multi-purpose stadium era.

The term &quot;soccer-specific stadium&quot; was coined by Lamar Hunt, who financed the construction of Columbus Crew Stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium constructed specifically for Major League Soccer. In the 2000s, other Major League Soccer teams in the United States began constructing their own stadiums. Canada&#x27;s first soccer-specific stadium was BMO Field in Toronto, home to Toronto FC. This stadium was renovated to accommodate Canadian football for the 2016 and subsequent seasons. The distinction is less prominent in Canada, where MLS&#x27;s attendance figures are comparable to those of the domestic Canadian Football League, and the CFL&#x27;s wider field means fewer compromises must be made to accommodate both; Tim Hortons Field was built purposely to both soccer specifications and CFL regulations. Of the three Canadian cities that host both MLS and CFL teams, only one (Montreal) has separate stadiums for each.

==Major League Soccer (MLS)==

===Under construction===
==National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL)==

===Current USLC and USL1 soccer-specific stadiums===
All USL Championship teams and USL League One teams will be required to play in self-owned, soccer-specific stadiums by the 2022 season. The following is a list of current USL stadiums that are soccer-specific stadiums:

==Other countries==

The term &quot;football-specific stadium&quot; is sometimes used in countries where the sport is known as football rather than soccer, although the term is not common in countries where association football is the dominant sport and thus football-specific stadiums are quite common. The term tends to have a slightly different meaning in these countries, usually referring to a stadium without an athletics track surrounding the field. Some soccer stadiums in Europe are also used for other sports, including rugby, American football, and field hockey. The problem with oversized stadiums designed for another sport is particularly visible in European American football leagues and conflicts between teams sharing the stadium (a notable example are Eintracht Braunschweig and the Braunschweig Lions which share a stadium) and (often municipal) owners of the stadiums sometimes arise, leading to attempts at single sport-specific venues.
In Australia the term has much the same meaning as that in the United States. The dominance of Australian rules football in the southern states means that unlike in New South Wales and Queensland, rectangular stadiums and grounds capable of hosting top level A-League soccer are rare. Hindmarsh Stadium in Adelaide, South Australia is an example of such a soccer-specific stadium, being built in the 1960s and progressively updated, the vast majority of matches played there are soccer, with very rare Rugby League or Rugby Union games. The Wyndham City Stadium and Wyndham Regional Football Facility are also examples. Many of the lower tier state league clubs own their own venues which also qualify as soccer specific.

<text>Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling is a fictional character played by British comedian Peter Cook throughout his career. Streeb-Greebling (or Greeb-Streebling, depending on Cook&#x27;s mood) is a stereotype of the upper class English duffer, described as &quot;narrow-minded&quot; and occasionally a &quot;heartless bastard&quot;. John Cleese described him as one of Cook&#x27;s range of &quot;men, particularly English men, so trapped by their culture that they never knew how to live&quot;.

He was usually presented in the form of interviews with various comedians or journalists acting as the interviewer, including Chris Morris and Ludovic Kennedy. The most frequent (and famous) interviewer was Cook&#x27;s comedy partner, Dudley Moore, in &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; and &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;.

==Biography==
Sir Arthur is the son of Lady Beryl Streeb-Greebling—a &quot;wonderful dancer&quot; who was still dancing at 107 years of age, and who &quot;was capable of breaking a swan&#x27;s wing with a blow of her nose&quot;—who inspired him to take up his life&#x27;s work of teaching ravens to fly underwater. Sir Arthur claims &quot;She came up to me in the conservatory—I was pruning some walnuts—and she said &#x27;Arthur&#x27;—I wasn&#x27;t Sir Arthur in those days—&#x27;if you don&#x27;t get underwater and start teaching ravens to fly, I&#x27;ll smash your stupid face off,&#x27; and I think it was this that sort of first started my interest in the whole business.&quot; However, his work is largely inconsequential. When Moore&#x27;s interviewer asks &quot;Is it difficult to get ravens to fly underwater?&quot; his honest response is &quot;Well, I think the word difficult is an awfully good one here. Yes, it is. It&#x27;s nigh impossible ... There they are sitting on my wrist. I say &#x27;Fly! Fly you little devils!!&#x27; ... [then] they drown. Little black feathery figure topples off my wrist and spirals to a watery grave. We&#x27;re knee deep in feathers off that part of the coast ... not a single success in the whole forty years of training.&quot; When a perplexed Moore asks if this makes his life a miserable failure, Sir Arthur is forced to reply, &quot;My life has been a miserable failure, yes.&quot;

Sir Arthur&#x27;s thirty-five years as a restaurateur were nothing short of disastrous. His restaurant &quot;The Frog and Peach&quot; was a catastrophic failure, owing to its location in the middle of a bog in the heart of the Yorkshire Moors, and its very limited menu—the &quot;nauseating&quot; &quot;Frog à la Pêche&quot; and the &quot;positively revolting&quot; &quot;Pêche à la Frog&quot;.

It was Sir Arthur&#x27;s father who inspired his life&#x27;s other work: the study of worms. Sir Arthur&#x27;s father claimed to have found the world&#x27;s longest worm, at approximately three thousand miles. He came across the head in the Andes and spent five years tracing it back to the Azores. However, accusations were made that he had actually discovered the head of one worm in the Andes and the tail of another worm in the Azores. As a result, Streeb-Greebling spent a great deal of his life trying to encourage worms to speak to him, again to no avail.

==Later interviews==
Towards the end of his life, Cook appeared as Streeb-Greebling, interviewed by Ludovic Kennedy in &quot;A Life In Pieces&quot;. The series of twelve five-minute interviews saw Sir Arthur recounting snippets of his life loosely based on &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;. Another set of more famous and successful interviews involving Cook as Streeb-Greebling with Chris Morris as the interviewer (basing his performance on his abrasive newsreader character from &quot;On the Hour&quot; and &quot;The Day Today&quot;) were broadcast on &quot;Why Bother?&quot; on BBC Radio 3 in 1994, less than a year before Cook&#x27;s death.

==Reaction==
William Cook described the character as &quot;one of Peter&#x27;s greatest comic creations&quot;, and felt it was a character that Peter Cook was &quot;born to play&quot;, seeing Streeb-Greebling as the closest to his own background. Harry Thompson agrees that the character was clearly autobiographical. Ben Thompson called the interviews with Morris &quot;some of the finest work either man has ever produced&quot;.

<doc id="1034312" wikidata="Q198609" url="?curid=1034312" title="Genuine (Stacie Orrico album)">
<text>Genuine is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Stacie Orrico. It was released by Forefront Records on August 29, 2000, in the United States. Orrico worked Mark Heimermann, Michael W. Smith, Tedd T, and Michael-Anthony Tyler on the album and co-wrote three tracks. &quot;Genuine&quot; earned generally mixed reviews and peaked at number 103 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look at Me,&quot; reached number one on the Christian hits radio (CHR) charts for eight consecutive weeks, breaking the record of any previous release on the musical chart. &quot;Don&#x27;t Look at Me&quot; also received a nomination for two GMA Dove Awards.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic editor Al Campbell rated the album two and a half stars out of five. He found that &quot;Genuine&quot; &quot;combines [Orrico&#x27;s] positive Christian convictions with musical inspiration, embracing the pop/urban influence represented by Christina Aguilera and Lauryn Hill. Orrico deals with tricky lyrical issues (insecurity, peer pressure, anorexia) while musically sustaining mainstream crossover appeal.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that &quot;Genuine&quot; &quot;is a muscular sound that offers lots to get listeners&#x27; attention but never obscures the charm of Orrico&#x27;s voice [...] All in all, this is an impressive debut from a young artist whose talent is sure to extend beyond the current teen-act boom.&quot;

==Chart performance==
&quot;Genuine&quot; debuted and peaked at number 103 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, setting a record in first-week sales for a Christian female debut, selling 13,000 copies. It also reached number six on the Top Christian Albums. By March 2001, &quot;Genuine&quot; sold more than 200,000 units in its first six months of release.

<text>The Besermyan, Biserman, Besermans or Besermens (, , ) are a numerically small Permian people in Russia.

The Russian Empire Census of 1897 listed 10,800 Besermans. There were 10,000 Besermans in 1926, but the Russian Census of 2002 found only 3,122 of them.

The Besermyan live in the districts of Yukamenskoye, Glazov, Balezino, and Yar in the northwest of Udmurtia. There are ten villages of pure Besermyan ethnicity in Russia, and 41 villages with a partial Besermyan population.

== History ==
The Besermyan are of Turkic origin, and are probably the result of a group of Tatars who were assimilated by the Udmurts. In the 13th century during his travel to Mongolia, papal envoy Plano Carpini claimed that the Besermyan were subjects of the Mongols. Russian chronicles sometimes made mention of the Besermyan but it&#x27;s unclear whether the term was meant to denote the modern group as it was a common derivation of the term &quot;musulman&quot; (Muslim). It is likely that the term had broader usage before it became an ethnonym.

== Culture ==
The language of the Besermyan is a dialect of the Udmurt language with Tatar influences. Although they speak a dialect of Udmurt, the Besermyan consider themselves a distinct people.

Some Besermyan traditions differ from other Udmurtian customs due to the Islamic influence during the Volga Bulgaria and Khanate of Kazan periods.

The Besermyan used to historically practice their own indigenous religion. According to scholar Shirin Akiner, most current Besermyan practice Sunni Islam. Some Besermyan also practice Christianity. The Russians began converting the Besermyan to Christianity around the middle of the 18th century.

==Genetics==
In a mtDNA research which was done on Besermyans there were 41 tested persons from the village of Yozhovo in Yukamenskovo raion of Udmurtia. The proportion of Eastern Eurasian haplogroups, primarily of haplogroup C, turned out to be significantly higher than that of the Udmurts. According to this indicator, the Besermyans genetically stand out against the background of the Volga-Ural region and are closer to the Turkic-speaking peoples of Southern Siberia.

A study was conducted of the Y-chromosome haplogroups of 53 Besermyans from the villages of Yukamenskoye and Yozhevo, as well as the village of Shamardan, Yukamensky district of Udmurtia. It turned out that more than half of the samples belong to haplogroup N, which may indicate the predominance of the Finno-Ugric component in the formation of the Besermyans along their male line.

Genetically, Besermayns seem to be descended mostly from Udmurts on their paternally and from the sub-group of Kazan Tatars - Chepetsk Tatars, maternally.

The data from lexicostatistics also did not reveal a noticeable Bulgar (Old Chuvash) substrate in the Besermyan dialect. Only Tatar adstrate, associated with the Chepetsk Tatars, can be traced.

According to a 2019 study, the Besermyan&#x27;s autosomal genetic admixture can be modeled as mostly Srubnaya-like and about 25 percent Nganasan-like.

<doc id="1034315" wikidata="Q142058" url="?curid=1034315" title="Mont-Laurier">
<text>Mont-Laurier () is a town and incorporated municipality in western Quebec, Canada, located on the banks of the Lièvre River (&quot;Rivière du Lièvre&quot;), a tributary of the Ottawa River. Known as the &quot;Capital of the Haute-Laurentides&quot;, the motto of the town is &quot;Laurus elationis praemium&quot;, which translates to &quot;Lift the laurels of reward&quot;. The demonym for its inhabitants is &quot;Lauriermontois&quot;.

According to the 2021 Canadian census, the population of Mont-Laurier is 14,180. It is the seat of Antoine-Labelle Regional County Municipality and the judicial district of Labelle.

==History==
The territory was originally inhabited by Oueskarinis, a sub tribe of Algonquians. The European settlers came from Sainte-Adèle in 1866, and the place was originally called &quot;Rapide-de-l&#x27;Orignal&quot; (English: Moose Rapids) in 1885, by Solime Alix. The name referred to, according to a legend, a panicked moose that made a huge leap at a waterfall on the Lièvre River. On Octobre 14, 1909, the place was incorporated as the Village Municipality of Mont-Laurier by separating from the Township Municipality of Campbell (founded in 1900). It was named in honour of Canadian Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

Just before the founding of the village municipality, the railway from Montreal through the Laurentides reached Mont-Laurier, with the first train arriving on September 15, 1909. Two months later the station was completed. As the terminus of the railway, it served as transit point for passengers and a center for receiving and shipping goods, handling between 100 and 125 freight cars every week. Freight wagons from Montreal brought coal, oil, or any other merchandise, while returning wagons were full of wood and animals. In 1940, a road from Mont-Laurier to Abitibi was built. This facilitated the growth of the trucking industry. Increased use of the road in the 1960s led to the decline of the railroad.

In 1950, Mont-Laurier changed statutes and became a &quot;ville&quot;. In 1971, it merged with the Township Municipality of Brunet (that succeeded Campbell Township in 1953).

On November 13, 1981, the &quot;P&#x27;tit train du Nord&quot; made its last passenger trip to Mont-Laurier, followed by the end of freight transport towards the end of the 1980s.

In 2003, Mont-Laurier merged with the neighbouring towns Des Ruisseaux and Saint-Aimé-du-Lac-des-Îles, with the name Mont-Laurier being chosen for the combined municipality. Following a 2004 demerger referendum vote, Saint-Aimé-du-Lac-des-Îles left Mont-Laurier in 2006 to be reconstituted as an independent municipality. The de-amalgamation did not affect Des Ruisseaux, which remains part of Mont-Laurier.

==Geography==
In addition to Mont-Laurier, the municipality also consists of the following population centres: Lac-Gatineau, Saint-Jean-sur-le-Lac, and Val-Limoges.

Mont-Laurier is located on the banks of the Rivière du Lièvre, a tributary of the Ottawa River, about from the river delta. Its location in the Laurentian Mountains places it at an altitude of 244 metres above mean sea level. It is surrounded by numerous lakes and mixed forests that support hunting, fishing and leisure, and the mainstay logging industry.

Mont-Laurier is located roughly at the halfway point of the major roadway from Montreal to Abitibi, Route 117, about northwest of Montreal. Route 309 follows the Lievre and leads to Gatineau, Quebec and Ottawa, Ontario, to the south.

===Climate===
Mont-Laurier has a humid continental climate (Dfb). It is strongly influenced by its inland position, with significant differences between the warm summers and the very cold winters. Precipitation is high year-round, causing significant snow cover in winter.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Mont-Laurier had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Economy==
Mont-Laurier is the administrative and commercial centre of the Haute-Lievre area. Many residents are employed by the various governments, the schools and the hospital. Most of the economic activity is generated by tourism, road transport and forestry. There is some agriculture, mostly dairy farming, and dairy products manufacturing.

==Government==
Michel Adrien, a black immigrant to Canada from Haiti, was elected mayor in 2003 with an 80% majority (in a town where more than 95% of the population are Caucasian, and less than 1% of the population are Black Canadians). With no opponent running against him, Adrien was reelected through acclamation in 2005, 2007 and 2009. In addition to a mayoral leader, the municipality is governed by a city council.

<text>Alexander Kilham (20 July 176220 December 1798) was an English Methodist minister.

==Early life==
He was born to parents Simon and Elizabeth Kilham at Epworth, Lincolnshire, possibly at a former farm, now known as Prospect House, otherwise 79 High Street.

==Ministry==
He was admitted by John Wesley in 1785 into the regular itinerant Methodist ministry. He became minister of a circuit in Sheffield; and also the leader and spokesman of the democratic party in the Connexion which claimed for the laity the free election of class-leaders and stewards, and equal representation with ministers at Conference. They also contended that the ministry should possess no official authority or pastoral prerogative, but should merely carry into effect the decisions of majorities in the different meetings.

Kilham further advocated the complete separation of the Methodists from the Anglican Church. In the controversy that ensued he wrote many pamphlets, often anonymous, and frequently provocative. For this he was arraigned before the Conference of 1796 and expelled, and he and William Thom then founded a movement initially called ‘The New Itinerancy’, then the Methodist New Connexion (1798, merged since 1907 in the United Methodist Church), and now part of the Methodist Church of Great Britain following the Methodist Union of 1932. Methodist church governance now largely reflects Kilham&#x27;s ideas.

Kilham and Thom jointly wrote the &quot;Out-lines of a constitution; proposed for the examination, amendment and acceptance, of the members of the Methodist New Itinerancy&quot;, which was published in 1797.

He died in 1798, and the success of the church he founded is a tribute to his personality and to the principles for which he strove. Kilham&#x27;s second wife, Hannah Kilham née Spurr (1774–1832), whom he married only a few months before his death, became a Quaker, and worked as a missionary in the Gambia and Sierra Leone; she transcribed to writing several West African languages.

<doc id="1034339" wikidata="Q1052390" url="?curid=1034339" title="Most recent common ancestor">
<text>A most recent common ancestor (MRCA), also known as a last common ancestor (LCA), is the most recent individual from which all organisms of a set are descended. The term is also used in reference to the ancestry of groups of genes (haplotypes) rather than organisms.

The MRCA of a set of individuals can sometimes be determined by referring to an established pedigree. However, in general, it is impossible to identify the exact MRCA of a large set of individuals, but an estimate of the time at which the MRCA lived can often be given. Such &quot;time to most recent common ancestor&quot; (&quot;TMRCA&quot;) estimates can be given based on DNA test results and established mutation rates as practiced in genetic genealogy, or by reference to a non-genetic, mathematical model or computer simulation.

In organisms using sexual reproduction, the &quot;matrilineal MRCA&quot; and &quot;patrilineal MRCA&quot; are the MRCAs of a given population considering only matrilineal and patrilineal descent, respectively. The MRCA of a population by definition cannot be older than either its matrilineal or its patrilineal MRCA. In the case of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, the matrilineal and patrilineal MRCA are also known as &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; (mt-MRCA) and &quot;Y-chromosomal Adam&quot; (Y-MRCA) respectively. The age of the human MRCA is unknown. It is no greater than the age of either the Y-MRCA or the mt-MRCA, estimated at 200,000 years.

Unlike in pedigrees of individual humans or domesticated lineages where historical parentage is known, in the inference of relationships among species or higher groups of taxa (systematics or phylogenetics), ancestors are not directly observable or recognizable. They are inferences based on patterns of relationship among taxa inferred in a phylogenetic analysis of extant organisms and/or fossils.

The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth, estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago (in the Paleoarchean).

==MRCA of different species==
The project of a complete description of the phylogenetic relationships among all biological species is dubbed the &quot;tree of life&quot;. This involves inference of ages of divergence for all hypothesized clades; for example, the MRCA of all Carnivora (cats, dogs, etc.) is estimated to have diverged some 42 million years ago (Miacidae).

The concept of the last common ancestor from the perspective of human evolution is described for a popular audience in &quot;The Ancestor&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Richard Dawkins. Dawkins lists &quot;concestors&quot; of the human lineage in order of increasing age, including hominin (humanchimpanzee), hominine (humangorilla), hominid (humanorangutan), hominoid (humangibbon), and so on in 40 stages in total, down to the last universal common ancestor (humanbacteria).

==MRCA of a population identified by a single genetic marker==

It is also possible to consider the ancestry of individual genes (or groups of genes, haplotypes) instead of an organism as a whole. Coalescent theory describes a stochastic model of how the ancestry of such genetic markers maps to the history of a population.

Unlike organisms, a gene is passed down from a generation of organisms to the next generation either as perfect replicas of itself or as slightly mutated &quot;descendant genes&quot;. While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via sexual reproduction, a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants. An organism produced by sexual cross-fertilization (allogamy) has at least two ancestors (its immediate parents), but a gene always has one ancestor per generation.

==Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCA==

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is nearly immune to sexual mixing, unlike the nuclear DNA whose chromosomes are shuffled and recombined in Mendelian inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA, therefore, can be used to trace matrilineal inheritance and to find the Mitochondrial Eve (also known as the &quot;African Eve&quot;), the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the mitochondrial DNA pathway.

Likewise, Y chromosome is present as a single sex chromosome in the male individual and is passed on to male descendants without recombination. It can be used to trace patrilineal inheritance and to find the Y-chromosomal Adam, the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the Y-DNA pathway.

Approximate dates for Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam have been established by researchers using genealogical DNA tests. Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived about 200,000 years ago. A paper published in March 2013 determined that, with 95% confidence and that provided there are no systematic errors in the study&#x27;s data, Y-chromosomal Adam lived between 237,000 and 581,000 years ago.

The MRCA of all humans alive today would, therefore, need to have lived more recently than either.

It is more complicated to infer human ancestry via autosomal chromosomes. Although an autosomal chromosome contains genes that are passed down from parents to children via independent assortment from only one of the two parents, genetic recombination (chromosomal crossover) mixes genes from non-sister chromatids from both parents during meiosis, thus changing the genetic composition of the chromosome.

== Time to MRCA estimates ==
Different types of MRCAs are estimated to have lived at different times in the past. These &quot;time to MRCA&quot; (&quot;TMRCA&quot;) estimates are also computed differently depending on the type of MRCA being considered. Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCAs (Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam) are traced by single gene markers, thus their TMRCA are computed based on DNA test results and established mutation rates as practiced in genetic genealogy. The time to the genealogical MRCA (most recent common ancestor by any line of descent) of all living humans cannot be traced genetically because the DNA of the great majority of ancestors is completely lost after a few hundred years. It is therefore computed based on non-genetic, mathematical models and computer simulations.

Since Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam are traced by single genes via a single ancestral parent line, the time to these genetic MRCAs will necessarily be greater than that for the genealogical MRCA. This is because single genes will coalesce more slowly than tracing of conventional human genealogy via both parents. The latter considers only individual humans, without taking into account whether any gene from the computed MRCA actually survives in every single person in the current population.

=== TMRCA via genetic markers ===
Mitochondrial DNA can be used to trace the ancestry of a set of populations. In this case, populations are defined by the accumulation of mutations on the mtDNA, and special trees are created for the mutations and the order in which they occurred in each population. The tree is formed through the testing of a large number of individuals all over the world for the presence or lack of a certain set of mutations. Once this is done it is possible to determine how many mutations separate one population from another. The number of mutations, together with estimated mutation rate of the mtDNA in the regions tested, allows scientists to determine the approximate time to MRCA (&quot;TMRCA&quot;) which indicates time passed since the populations last shared the same set of mutations or belonged to the same haplogroup.

In the case of Y-Chromosomal DNA, TMRCA is arrived at in a different way. Y-DNA haplogroups are defined by single-nucleotide polymorphism in various regions of the Y-DNA. The time to MRCA within a haplogroup is defined by the accumulation of mutations in STR sequences of the Y-Chromosome of that haplogroup only. Y-DNA network analysis of Y-STR haplotypes showing a non-star cluster indicates Y-STR variability due to multiple founding individuals. Analysis yielding a star cluster can be regarded as representing a population descended from a single ancestor. In this case the variability of the Y-STR sequence, also called the microsatellite variation, can be regarded as a measure of the time passed since the ancestor founded this particular population. The descendants of Genghis Khan or one of his ancestors represents a famous star cluster that can be dated back to the time of Genghis Khan.

TMRCA calculations are considered critical evidence when attempting to determine migration dates of various populations as they spread around the world. For example, if a mutation is deemed to have occurred 30,000 years ago, then this mutation should be found amongst all populations that diverged after this date. If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread and formation of regionally isolated populations then this must be reflected in the isolation of subsequent genetic mutations in this region. If genetic divergence and regional divergence coincide it can be concluded that the observed divergence is due to migration as evidenced by the archaeological record. However, if the date of genetic divergence occurs at a different time than the archaeological record, then scientists will have to look at alternate archaeological evidence to explain the genetic divergence. The issue is best illustrated in the debate surrounding the demic diffusion versus cultural diffusion during the European Neolithic.

=== TMRCA of all living humans ===
The age of the MRCA of all living humans is unknown. It is necessarily younger than the age of either the matrilinear or the patrilinear MRCA, both of which have an estimated age of between roughly 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.

A study by mathematicians Joseph T. Chang, Douglas Rohde and Steve Olson used a theoretical model to calculate that the MRCA may have lived remarkably recently, possibly as recently as 2,000 years ago. It concludes that the MRCA of all humans probably lived in East Asia, which would have given them key access to extremely isolated populations in Australia and the Americas. Possible locations for the MRCA include places such as the Chuckchi and Kamchatka Peninsulas that are close to Alaska, places such as Indonesia and Malaysia that are close to Australia or a place such as Taiwan or Japan that is more intermediate to Australia and the Americas. European colonization of the Americas and Australia was found by Chang to be too recent to have had a substantial impact on the age of the MRCA. In fact, if the Americas and Australia had never been discovered by Europeans, the MRCA would only be about 2.3% further back in the past than it is.

Note that the age of the MRCA of a population does not correspond to a population bottleneck, let alone a &quot;first couple&quot;. It rather reflects the presence of a single individual with high reproductive success in the past, whose genetic contribution has become pervasive throughout the population over time. It is also incorrect to assume that the MRCA passed all, or indeed any, genetic information to every living person. Through sexual reproduction, an ancestor passes half of his or her genes to each descendant in the next generation; in the absence of pedigree collapse, after just 32 generations the contribution of a single ancestor would be on the order of 2−32, a number proportional to less than a single basepair within the human genome.

== Identical ancestors point ==

The MRCA is the most recent &quot;common&quot; ancestor shared by all individuals in the population under consideration. This MRCA may well have contemporaries who are also ancestral to some but not all of the extant population. The &quot;identical ancestors point&quot; is a point in the past more remote than the MRCA at which time there are no longer organisms which are ancestral to some but not all of the modern population. Due to pedigree collapse, modern individuals may still exhibit clustering, due to vastly different contributions from each of ancestral population.

<doc id="1034351" wikidata="Q505477" url="?curid=1034351" title="Mitsubishi Galant Lambda">
<text>The Mitsubishi Galant Λ (Lambda) is a two-door, four-seat hardtop/notchback coupé built by Mitsubishi from 1976 until 1984. From 1978, it was exported under various names; such as the Mitsubishi Sapporo in Europe and South America (named for the Japanese city of Sapporo, which was considered to have positive international connotations after having hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics), the Dodge (Colt) Challenger and Plymouth Sapporo in North America and Puerto Rico, and the Chrysler Sigma Scorpion, Chrysler Scorpion and later the Mitsubishi Scorpion in Australia. It was also sold as a Sapporo in the United Kingdom under the &quot;Colt&quot; brand.

For the 1987 model year, Mitsubishi resurrected the Sapporo name for their Mitsubishi Galant Sapporo. However, this version was an unrelated front-wheel drive, four-door sedan.

==History==
Introduced in Japan in December 1976, the Lambda was described not as a coupé but a &quot;personal luxury car&quot;, as Mitsubishi already had the Lancer-based &quot;Celeste&quot; coupé in its line-up. It competed in Japan with the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric, Nissan Gloria, and the Mazda Cosmo coupes newly introduced to Japan. In Australia, the car was imported from Japan as a flagship model of Chrysler Australia&#x27;s successful Sigma range.


==Styling==
In the mid-1970s, smaller personal luxury cars were a growing trend. Pursuing this market segment, the Lambda/Sapporo featured frameless door glass, canopy vinyl roofs, velour upholstered interiors, wheel covers with whitewall tires, and numerous power assists. 

In 1980, the second generation featured styled steel wheels with blackwall tires, less chrome trim and interior courtesy lights, a fuse box with fuse built-in test light and under seat as well as console storage —&#x27; and a radio antenna incorporated into the trunk lid.

The wheelbase and bodywork were lengthened with a revised roofline while remaining within the Japanese Government dimension regulations. Revisions offered increased shoulder room, front and rear leg room, headroom and trunk capacity — and merited a new chassis code, shifting from A120 to A160. The shifter was moved closer to the driver, and ventilation was improved. The interior provided additional carpeting, acoustic dampening materials, and a double-thickness front bulkhead.

==Mechanicals==
The Mitsubishi Galant Lambda was available with a variety of engines, including diesel, several normally aspirated gasoline engines, and one of the earliest applications of the long-running turbocharged 2.0 L &quot;4G63T&quot; engine in the top GSR model which also featured independent rear suspension. It was available in the North American market in one basic configuration, which combined the GSR&#x27;s close-ratio transmission, a live axle rear suspension, and a larger engine. Rear disc brakes and alloy wheels were available together as a package. Other US options were minimal; air conditioning, cassette player, automatic transmission, cruise control, power door locks, power mirrors, power windows, and a moonroof.

The American, Australian, and Japanese-market 2.6 L &quot;Astron&quot; engine helped introduce Mitsubishi&#x27;s then-new &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; balance shaft engine technology, which minimized the inherent vibration of a large four-cylinder in-line engine. Japanese buyers were liable for more annual road tax for selecting the 2.6 L engine over the smaller engines. The US version also featured a &quot;Jet Valve&quot;, a small secondary intake valve that improved emissions by enhancing swirl in the combustion chamber, allowing for utilizing of a leaner fuel mixture. A similar engine without the Jet Valve was available in Mitsubishi-built trucks and the Canadian versions of the Sapporo/Challenger. It was also used in many Chrysler K-cars and their derivatives.

Beginning in 1980, Japanese versions were available with electronic fuel injection, or a new 2.3 L Astron turbodiesel engine.

The suspension was revised for the 1980 model year (the second generation), with improved geometry in front and an all-new four-link rear suspension. The turbo models were introduced, of which some came with independent rear suspension (as later applied to the Starion). The second generation also brought variable-assist power steering, which provided increased assistance at low speeds and less at higher speeds. It was also slightly bigger, with increased foot room, headroom, and luggage space.

The Galant Lambda GSR was a predecessor to the more sporting Mitsubishi Starion based on the same chassis and drivetrain. The Starion continued the rear-wheel-drive Galants&#x27; model codes, being called the A180, while the new front-wheel-drive Galants started afresh from E10.

==North America==

The car was marketed in North America as a captive import of the Dodge and Plymouth divisions of Chrysler. The cars differed only in minor details, such as taillights, interior trim, and available colors. Although mechanically identical, the Dodge Colt Challenger was positioned to appeal to the performance segment, while the Plymouth Sapporo targeted the luxury market. The earliest Dodge Colt Challengers were available only in a two-tone silver/charcoal paint to enhance its sportier nature. For the 1979 model year, four more color combinations became available. Equipment was complete for the time, with remote opening trunk, electrically controlled exterior mirrors, map lights, crushed velour seats, etcetera. The larger-engined cars included four-wheel disc brakes as standard; both engines were available with a five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic.

As in other markets, the Challenger/Sapporo received all-new bodywork for the 1981 model year. Originally a 1.6 L four was also available, but the second generation North American market cars received only the 2.6 L inline-four with balance shafts and . The Dodge versions became simply the Dodge Challenger after 1981, dropping the &quot;Colt&quot; part of the name. An electric sunroof was also new.

Although the car received generally positive reviews, it was unsuccessful in the United States. The Challenger and Sapporo were discontinued after the 1983 model year to make way for the products of the newly formed Chrysler-Mitsubishi joint venture, Diamond-Star Motors, as well as the entrance of Mitsubishi into the American market under its name. The same platform and 2.6 L engine under the Challenger and Sapporo were continued through 1989 as the Conquest sports car.

<text>In signal processing, the chirplet transform is an inner product of an input signal with a family of analysis primitives called chirplets.

Similar to the wavelet transform, chirplets are usually generated from (or can be expressed as being from) a single &quot;mother chirplet&quot; (analogous to the so-called &quot;mother wavelet&quot; of wavelet theory).

==Definitions==
The term &quot;chirplet transform&quot; was coined by Steve Mann, as the title of the first published paper on chirplets. The term &quot;chirplet&quot; itself (apart from chirplet transform) was also used by Steve Mann, Domingo Mihovilovic, and Ronald Bracewell to describe a windowed portion of a chirp function. In Mann&#x27;s words:

The chirplet transform thus represents a rotated, sheared, or otherwise transformed tiling of the time–frequency plane. Although chirp signals have been known for many years in radar, pulse compression, and the like, the first published reference to the &quot;chirplet transform&quot; described specific signal representations based on families of functions related to one another by time–varying frequency modulation or frequency varying time modulation, in addition to time and frequency shifting, and scale changes. In that paper, the Gaussian chirplet transform was presented as one such example, together with a successful application to ice fragment detection in radar (improving target detection results over previous approaches). The term &quot;chirplet&quot; (but not the term &quot;chirplet transform&quot;) was also proposed for a similar transform, apparently independently, by Mihovilovic and Bracewell later that same year.

==Applications==
The first practical application of the chirplet transform was in water-human-computer interaction (WaterHCI) for marine safety, to assist vessels in navigating through ice-infested waters, using marine radar to detect growlers (small iceberg fragments too small to be visible on conventional radar, yet large enough to damage a vessel).

Other applications of the chirplet transform in WaterHCI include the SWIM (Sequential Wave Imprinting Machine).

More recently other practical applications have been developed, including image processing (e.g. where there is periodic structure imaged through projective geometry),
as well as to excise chirp-like interference in spread spectrum communications, in EEG processing, and Chirplet Time Domain Reflectometry.

==Extensions==
The warblet transform is a particular example of the chirplet transform introduced by Mann and Haykin in 1992 and now widely used. It provides a signal representation based on cyclically varying frequency modulated signals (warbling signals).

<text>Fahrenhype 9/11 (stylized FahrenHYPE 9/11) is a 2004 documentary video made in response to Michael Moore&#x27;s documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. Part of a large group of documentaries that began appearing in the mid-2000s as improved technology allowed anyone to quickly and affordably create movies, the video was created in 28 days and was narrated by Ron Silver. Dick Morris (who also receives a co-writing credit), appears frequently, and features interviews with various political figures, including David Frum, Georgia Democratic Senator Zell Miller, social and political commentator Ann Coulter, and former Democratic New York City mayor Ed Koch.

The movie was released with a companion book, on October 5, 2004, the same day that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was released on home video.

==Reviews and response==
The documentary received four reviews at Rotten Tomatoes. Film reviewer Robert Koehler described the film in &quot;Variety&quot; as &quot;a broadside,&quot; and noted that &quot;it&#x27;s vastly inferior in content and style to its Moore produced counterpart.&quot; Jim Emerson reviewed the video as well, saying that the documentary &quot;isn&#x27;t exactly a thorough or level-headed piece of reasoning or investigative journalism; it&#x27;s every bit the hot-headed political advertisement that Moore&#x27;s film was, just a lot less funny.&quot;

After receiving complaints about fairness, a library in San Diego postponed and moved a free showing of Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; film to a location where it could be shown along with this video. Controversy was generated in Chicago when a student from the Northwestern University Young Republicans had publicized an election night party and showing of the documentary in the bar area of a theater, after the offer was rescinded by theater management. An after school showing of Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; requested by North Sutton, New Hampshire high school students was cancelled after several conservative parents complained. The high school superintendent told the teachers to, &quot;in the interests of balance&quot;, not show &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; without also showing &quot;Fahrenhype&quot;.
