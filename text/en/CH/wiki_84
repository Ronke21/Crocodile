<text>Bette Mildred Stephenson Pengelly (July 31, 1924 – August 19, 2019) was a Canadian medical doctor and politician in Ontario. She served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1987 and was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller.

==Background==
Stephenson was born in Aurora, Ontario, the daughter of Clara Mildred (Draper) and Carl Melvin Stephenson. She graduated from Earl Haig Secondary School in North York, Ontario in 1941 and was the only female in her class to go on to university. She entered University of Toronto Medical School at the age of 17, a year younger than what was then the minimum age for admission, after persuading the dean to waive both the rule and the $680 tuition fee.

She attained her medical degree from the University of Toronto in 1946. Stephenson practised medicine for more than 40 years. She was a member of the medical staff, a Director of the Outpatient Department, and Chief of the Department of General Practice at Women&#x27;s College Hospital. She was also a member of the medical staff at North York General Hospital.

She was a founding member of the College of General Practice in Canada, now known as the College of Family Physicians of Canada. She was also the first female member of the board of directors of the Ontario Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Association, and served as the first female president of both organizations. In 1974, she released a report stating that there were too many foreign-born students at the University of Toronto, particularly from China. The statements she made led some Chinese physicians to create the Federation of Chinese Canadian Professionals of Ontario which later became the Chinese Canadian Medical Society.

On behalf of the CMA, she lobbied then-Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau to remove abortion from the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. According to Stephenson, he agreed to do so but then reneged and instead introduced amendments to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; that provided for abortions only when the health of the woman was in danger as determined by a three-doctor hospital committee.

==Politics==
Stephenson was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1975 provincial election, representing the constituency of York Mills in North York. She was appointed to Bill Davis&#x27; cabinet as Minister of Labour on October 7, 1975. She won a convincing re-election victory over Liberal candidate Wilfred Caplan in the 1977 election.

On August 18, 1978, she was named Minister of Education and Minister of Colleges and Universities. As Minister, she ordered Toronto schools to use the Lord&#x27;s Prayer during opening or closing exercise instead of silent meditation. She was returned to the legislature with the largest majority of her career in the 1981 provincial election.

Stephenson was a driving force behind the ICON computer project, in which a thin client networked computer was designed and built to Ontario specifications for classroom use. Introduced in 1984, the ICON was controversial and was eventually orphaned with support discontinued in 1994.

Stephenson was not informed of Davis&#x27;s decision in 1984 to extend full funding to Catholic high schools until the policy had already been decided, and was privately opposed but did not resign from cabinet in protest due to her loyalty to Davis.

The Progressive Conservatives under Davis was considered a Red Tory party, however, Stephenson was on the party&#x27;s conservative wing. She considered running to succeed Davis at the January 1985 PC Party of Ontario leadership convention but did not want to split the vote with fellow right-winger Frank Miller who was also considering running, so the two agreed that only one of them would run. When Miller decided to announce his candidacy, Stephenson supported him prominently.

When Miller replaced Davis as Premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, he named Stephenson as the Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet.

Under Miller&#x27;s leadership, the Progressive Conservatives were reduced to a tenuous minority government in the 1985 provincial election. Stephenson was personally re-elected without difficulty, and was named as Ontario&#x27;s first female Treasurer and Deputy Premier on May 17. She accomplished little in these roles. Before having the chance as Treasurer to present a budget, the Miller government was defeated by a motion of non-confidence in June 1985, after the Liberals reached an agreement allowing them to form government with the support of the Ontario New Democratic Party. In opposition, she served as her party&#x27;s Critic for Health. She retired from politics at the 1987 provincial election.

==After politics==
In the 1990s, Stephenson was appointed as a board member on the province&#x27;s new Education Quality and Accountability Office, which monitors and reports to the public on the performance of the education system. From 1997 to 2005, she was chair of the Learning Opportunities Task Force. and was involved with the Gwillimbury Foundation in its attempt to build a university in Queensville, Ontario. She is a founding member of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and also served on the boards of the Ontario Innovation Trust and the police services board overseeing the Ontario Provincial Police.

In 1992, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of having &quot;made exceptional contributions to society throughout her career&quot;. In 1999, she was awarded the Order of Ontario and the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case. The Bette Stephenson Centre for Learning, a York Region District School Board school in Richmond Hill offering adult education programs, was named after her. In 2013, she was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

Stephenson died in Richmond Hill on August 19, 2019, at the age of 95.

<doc id="1036448" wikidata="Q5524054" url="?curid=1036448" title="Garrison Point Fort">
<text>Garrison Point Fort is a former artillery fort situated at the end of the Garrison Point peninsula at Sheerness on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. Built in the 1860s in response to concerns about a possible French invasion, it was the last in a series of artillery batteries that had existed on the site since the mid-16th century. The fort&#x27;s position enabled it to guard the strategic point where the River Medway meets the Thames. It is a rare example of a two-tiered casemated fort – one of only two of that era in the country – with a design that is otherwise similar to that of several of the other forts along the lower Thames. It remained operational until 1956 and is now used by the Sheerness Docks as a port installation.

==Strategic context==
The fort was constructed in response to a naval arms race between Britain and France. Britain&#x27;s coastal defences had not been substantially upgraded since the Napoleonic Wars, but a new generation of accurate and powerful guns, mounted on fast-moving, manoeuvrable iron-clad warships, had obsoleted the existing 18th and early 19th century forts along the British coastline. The Thames was seen as particularly vulnerable; as well as being one of the country&#x27;s most important trade routes, it possessed several naval installations of great importance, including the victualling yards at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet.

The government&#x27;s response to the increased threat was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. It recommended that many existing forts should be upgraded or rebuilt entirely, and that new forts should be constructed to guard particularly strategic or vulnerable points along the coast. In all, around 70 forts and batteries were constructed around the English coast as a result of the Royal Commission&#x27;s report.
Garrison Point had long been fortified. A square blockhouse was constructed there by 1547, during the reign of Henry VIII. It was in the process of being replaced with a new fort when it was destroyed in the June 1667 Raid on the Medway during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. It was rebuilt as a bastion fort by 1669 to a design by Bernard de Gomme, who also designed Tilbury Fort further upriver. Two additional fortifications, the Half Moon Battery and Cavalier Battery, were subsequently added to further strengthen the defences. The Royal Commission recommended that de Gomme&#x27;s red brick fortification and the two later batteries, which were incapable of withstanding modern guns, should be replaced by an armoured artillery fort on the same site. Its arc of fire would overlap that of Grain Fort and Grain Tower (and later Grain Wing Battery and Dummy Battery) on the other side of the Medway on the Isle of Grain.

==Construction and layout==

Construction began in February 1861 and continued until the last of its shielding was installed in June 1872, by which time about half of the guns were already in place. The new fort took the form of a semi-circular structure, one of only two built in the 1860s fortification programme (the other being Picklecombe Fort in Cornwall). It had two gun floors, each with 17 granite-faced casemates, in which 36 heavy guns were mounted behind 2,000 tons of iron shields. Another two gun turrets were planned for the roof but were not built. The magazines were located below ground in the basement of the fort. The bulk of the structure was built of brick, with concrete additions. The walls and piers are thick. The semi-circular row of casemates is closed off to the rear by a row of defensible buildings constructed from ashlar blocks of Kentish ragstone, with loopholes and gun ports in the flanks to facilitate close defence of the fort. A parade ground occupied the middle of the fort.

==Operational history==

Garrison Point Fort was initially armed with 9-inch and 10-inch rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns. By 1880 its armament had been expanded to include 9-inch, 10-inch, 11-inch and 12.5-inch RMLs. A Brennan torpedo station, used to launch wire-guided torpedoes, was added to the fort&#x27;s structure in 1884 and remained in use until around 1906. The RMLs were obsolete by the end of the 19th century and had been removed by 1896, when the casemates were all converted to barracks and stores. In 1909 two 6-inch Mk. VII breech-loading (BL) guns were mounted on the fort&#x27;s roof and four 12-pounder quick-firing guns were installed in a lower tier of the casemates.

A coastal artillery searchlight and concrete magazine were constructed to the east of the fort during the First World War, along with a machine-gun pillbox that no longer survives. Garrison Point Fort remained in service through the Second World War and was re-armed with two twin 6-pounder Quick Firing (QF) guns to defend against fast-moving attackers such as E-boats and destroyers. One of them was mounted on the fort&#x27;s roof and the other was situated outside the front of the casemates. New gun emplacements, gun towers, a magazine and a searchlight emplacement were all constructed at this time. By 1944 the threat of invasion or seaborne attack had diminished to the point that the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status.

After the war, the fort was used by the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service as an emergency port control centre in the event of a nuclear war. Part of the fort&#x27;s disused magazine was converted into a bunker housing nuclear defence officials. The fort was decommissioned in 1956 when the UK discontinued its coastal defence programme, and the structure was sold off to the owners of the adjacent Sheerness Docks.

==Current status==

The fort has been a Grade II listed building since 1977 and is part of the wider system of the Sheerness defences, listed as a scheduled monument. It is owned by Medway Ports Ltd, the operators of the Sheerness Docks, and is not publicly accessible as it lies within the port area. Some alterations have been made to the fort to enable its use in connection with the port. It was used for a time in the 1980s as a terminal for a now-defunct ferry service to the Continent, which involved fitting a walkway to the ferries through one of the casemates. A navigational radar control tower was installed on the fort&#x27;s roof in 1962.

Garrison Point Fort is reportedly in a state of &quot;slow decay&quot; which has led it to be listed on the Heritage at Risk Register. Although the interior has been largely stripped out, traces remain of the original fittings. A considerable amount remains of the Brennan Torpedo station and its launching rails, though it is corroding badly. While the fort&#x27;s structure is still basically intact its roof and much of its interior are derelict and decaying.

<text>Slough Fort is a small artillery fort that was built at Allhallows-on-Sea in the north of the Hoo Peninsula in Kent. Constructed in 1867, the D-shaped fort was intended to guard a vulnerable stretch of the River Thames against possible enemy landings during a period of tension with France. Its seven casemates initially accommodated rifled breech loading guns, which were replaced by the turn of the century by more powerful breech-loaders on disappearing carriages, mounted in concrete wing batteries on either side of the fort. It was likely one of the smallest of the forts constructed as a result of the 1860s invasion scare.

All of the guns were removed by 1912, though the fort continued in use during the First World War as a command post. It was decommissioned in 1920 and sold off in 1929. Since the 1960s, it has been used as a stables adjoining a holiday camp. The camp&#x27;s owners funded a partial restoration in 2012–13 that uncovered previously buried features of the fort.

==Strategic context==

The fort was constructed in response to a naval arms race between Britain and France. Britain&#x27;s coastal defences had not been substantially upgraded since the Napoleonic Wars, but a new generation of accurate and powerful guns, mounted on fast-moving, manoeuvrable iron-clad warships, had rendered obsolete the existing 18th and early 19th century forts along the British coastline. The Thames was seen as particularly vulnerable; as well as being one of the country&#x27;s most important trade routes, it possessed several naval installations of great importance, including the victualling yards at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet.

The government&#x27;s response to the increased threat was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. It recommended that many existing forts should be upgraded or rebuilt entirely, and that new forts should be constructed to guard particularly strategic or vulnerable points along the coast. In all, around 70 forts and batteries were constructed around the English coast as a result of the Royal Commission&#x27;s report. Slough Fort was probably one of the smallest of these.

==Construction==

The position of Slough Fort (which took its name from the now-disappeared farmsteads of Upper and Lower Slough, just west of the fort) was dictated by its position on a ridge overlooking a slope leading down to the riverside. It was the only point along a fourteen-mile stretch of the river between Cliffe to the west and Grain to the east where a landing could be effected, due to the marshes along the rest of the shoreline. A fort situated at that point could thus provide an effective defence against an enemy attempting to land here. It also served to fill the gap between the upriver forts (Cliffe, Coalhouse and Shornemead) and those at the mouth of the Medway (Grain and Garrison Point). As an 1869 report noted, the fort was constructed &quot;to prevent an enemy landing at the only accessible point for the purpose of attacking Chatham Dockyard from the north&quot;.
The land for the fort was bought by the War Office in 1861 for £1,639, but it was not built until 1867. The estimated cost of constructing the fort was reported in 1869 to be £27,343 (equivalent to £ today). It took the form of a semicircular arc of seven casemates facing the river with a defensive ditch in front. Each casemate was faced in granite with magazines below providing ammunition via hoist shafts. A defensible block constructed of Kentish ragstone closed off the arc and provided the fort&#x27;s domestic accommodation. The fort&#x27;s main entrance is at the centre of the defensible block. A small stone-paved parade ground occupied the centre of the fort. After it was built, the ground behind the fort was raised and made into a glacis. On the roof of the fort, accessed from the ground level by two spiral staircases, there was an observation post protected by a banquette (an elevated step to facilitate rifle fire against attackers at close range).

==Operational history==

Slough Fort was initially armed with seven 7-inch rifled breech loaders (RBLs) positioned in the casemates. It was manned by three officers, one NCO and 75 other ranks. Between October 1889 and December 1891, a pair of wing batteries were constructed from concrete on either side of the fort, with a range finder position being added to the fort&#x27;s roof. The new batteries accommodated two 9.2-inch and two 6-inch breech loaders on disappearing mountings, allowing them to recess below ground level once they had fired. These were much more powerful and longer ranged weapons than the old RBLs and were capable of engaging a battleship at a substantial distance. The old RBLs were removed.

The structure of the fort underwent substantial changes around this time. The casemates, which were now vulnerable to the more powerful artillery that had been developed since they were built, were covered almost up to roof level by an earthen glacis. Their interiors were also partly infilled with rubble, as was the defensive ditch in front of the casemates, providing additional protection against enemy fire as it helped to camouflage the structure. Two light quick-firing guns with ammunition lockers were installed on the fort&#x27;s roof to guard against small, fast-moving threats such as torpedo boats. The rest of the fort remained intact but was now used as a barracks for the wing batteries. Three of the truncated casemates were converted into married quarters, one became officers&#x27; quarters and the final three were used by the men. An additional set of detached quarters for a Warrant Officer and a small detachment of Royal Engineers was constructed to the south-east of the fort, along with barrack stores.

Two new 9.2-inch guns were installed in 1906 in the western wing battery. They were mounted on barbettes, enabling them to recoil along their axis and so delivering a much faster rate of fire. One 9.2-inch and one 6-inch gun on a disappearing mounting remained in the eastern wing battery before being removed in 1907. During the war the fort was used as a Battery Command Post operating in conjunction with a Port War Signal Station located to the fort&#x27;s east, which was responsible for monitoring all shipping entering or leaving the Thames. The remaining two 9.2-inch guns were removed in 1917 and reinstalled at Fletcher Battery, a newly built position on the Isle of Sheppey.

The Army discontinued the use of the fort in 1920 and in 1929 it was sold off and converted into a small zoo. It saw one further period of military usage during and immediately before the Second World War; it was used as an observation post from 1938, became part of the local anti-invasion system in 1939–40 and was used as part of the air defence network against V-1 flying bombs in 1944. After the war it belonged to the Allhallows Estate Company before passing to Strood Rural District Council. Plans were advanced to demolish it but the cost proved prohibitive. It was instead converted into a riding stables in the early 1960s.

==Current status==

Slough Fort is well-preserved and still substantially intact, though it has suffered some damage over the years (notably the loss of the outermost gun position of the left wing battery) and is surrounded on three sides by the caravans of the Allhallows Leisure Park. English Heritage designated it as a Grade II* listed building in 2009 in recognition of its unusually good state of preservation and for the way that it embodies &quot;both technological developments in armaments and coastal defence during the late-C19 to early-C20 as well as the changing views of the perceived defensive need on the north Kent coast at this time.&quot; The wing batteries have been listed separately, also since 2009, as a scheduled monument in recognition of their rarity.

The fort is currently privately owned and continues to be used as a stables; the casemates are used as stalls for the horses. The main body of the fort is not accessible to the public, but Bourne Leisure, the owners of the adjoining Allhallows Leisure Park, have funded a partial restoration. The wing batteries have been cleared of thousands of tons of accumulated debris, a walking trail linking them has been laid out and interpretative signs have been installed for the benefit of visitors to show how the fort once appeared and how it functioned when it was in use. The Slough Fort Preservation Trust is working to repair the fort and increase public access.

<doc id="1036466" wikidata="Q5311997" url="?curid=1036466" title="Dudleytown, Connecticut">
<text>Dudleytown is an abandoned settlement, located in a valley known as the Dark Entry Forest, in northwestern Connecticut in the United States, best known today as a ghost town. Due to vandalism and trespassers, the site is not open to the public.

Since the mid-1920s, the land occupied by the village has been maintained by philanthropists as a private land trust, who worked to reforest the land after decades of agricultural use. Only a few traces, such as cellar holes, remain of the original village. Due to rumors of ghost activity beginning in the 1980s, the village site has been subject to frequent vandalism, and the owners have since closed the land to the public.

==History==
Dudleytown was never an actual town. The name was given at an unknown date to a portion of Cornwall that included several members of the Dudley family. The area that became known as Dudleytown was settled in the early 1740s by Thomas Griffis, followed by Gideon Dudley and, by 1753, Barzillai Dudley and Abiel Dudley; Martin Dudley joined them a few years later. Other families also settled there.

As with every other part of Cornwall, Connecticut, Dudleytown was converted from forest to farm land. Families tilled the land for generations. Located on top of a high hill {all other references say it was in a valley}, Dudleytown was not ideally suited for farming. When more fertile and spacious land opened up in the Midwest in the mid-19th century, and as the local iron industry wound down, Cornwall&#x27;s population declined.

==Geography and conservation==
The village was located a few miles south of the Cornwall Bridge neighborhood of Cornwall. It was located in a valley, known as the Dark Entry Forest, due to the shadows caused by the mountains surrounding the village and access road. The town&#x27;s abandonment has meant that barely any ruins of the original township survive. During the early 20th century, old farms in Cornwall were sold to New Yorkers seeking a better life in the countryside, including Dudleytown, which has been privately owned since 1924 by Dark Entry Forest, Incorporated. The land surrounding the village site is today closed to the public.

In promoting the land trust to investors, a March 1924 prospectus for the Dark Entry Forest stated: &quot;This society is planned to promote forestation, to run a wood mill, to promote conservation of bird, animal and wildflower life, and to afford a playground for you and your children and your children&#x27;s children.&quot; Soon after acquisition, the owners planted thousands of trees. During the 1930s, New York&#x27;s Skidreiverein Club spent their winter weekends skiing on trails they built in the area; in the summers, they canoed down the Housatonic River. Horse riding camps for children were also held on the site.

==Rumors and vandalism==

Dudleytown is said to be haunted. A local rumor that has been frequently shared on the internet alleges the founders of the town were descended from Edmund Dudley, an English nobleman who was beheaded for treason during the reign of Henry VII. From that moment on, the Dudley family was placed under a curse which followed them across the Atlantic to America. This curse is blamed for instances of crop failures and mental illness, as well as several purported violent deaths in the village. Local historians have found no genealogical link between the Dudley family of Cornwall and the English nobleman and noted many other factual inconsistencies in the rumors. Records have shown the land was originally occupied by the Mohawk Nation, as sacred ground. The village&#x27;s decline has instead been attributed to its distance from clean drinking water and unsuitable soil for cultivation. One confirmed case of suicide of a village resident took place in New York state rather than within Cornwall.

Since the 1990s, police in Cornwall have responded to numerous cases of vandalism. In a 1993 interview with Playboy, actor Dan Aykroyd referred to Dudleytown as the &quot;most haunted place on earth&quot;. In the same interview, he mistakenly stated that Dudleytown was in Massachusetts. The 1999 movie, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, about a haunted forest, prompted increased interest in the allegedly haunted village. This increased the frequency of incidents of vandalism. The owners of the Dudleytown&#x27;s property have closed it to the public.

<doc id="1036472" wikidata="Q1911186" url="?curid=1036472" title="Maunsell Forts">
<text>The Maunsell Forts are towers built in the Thames and Mersey estuaries during the Second World War to help defend the United Kingdom. They were operated as army and navy forts, and named for their designer, Guy Maunsell. The forts were decommissioned during the late 1950s and later used for other activities including pirate radio broadcasting. One of the forts is managed by the unrecognised Principality of Sealand; boats visit the remaining forts occasionally, and a consortium named Project Redsands is planning to conserve the fort situated at Red Sands. The aesthetic attraction of the Maunsell forts has been considered to be associated with the aesthetics of decay, transience and nostalgia.

During the summers of 2007 and 2008 Red Sands Radio, a station commemorating the pirate radio stations of the 1960s, operated from the Red Sands fort on 28-day Restricted Service Licences. The fort was subsequently declared unsafe, and Red Sands Radio has moved its operations ashore to Whitstable.

Forts had been built in river mouths and similar locations to defend against ships, such as the Grain Tower Battery at the mouth of the Medway dating from 1855, Plymouth Breakwater Fort, completed 1865, the four Spithead Forts: Horse Sand Fort, No Mans Land and St Helens Forts which were built 1865–1880 and Spitbank Fort, built during the 1880s, the Humber Forts on Bull &amp; Haile Sands, completed in late 1919, and the Nab Tower, intended as part of a World War I anti-submarine defense but only set in place in 1920.

==Maunsell naval forts==

The Maunsell naval forts were built in the Thames estuary and operated by the Royal Navy, to deter and report German air raids following the Thames as a landmark, and prevent attempts to lay mines by aircraft in this important shipping channel.
There were four naval forts:
* Rough Sands (HM Fort Roughs) (U1) 
* Sunk Head (U2) 
* Tongue Sands (U3) 
* Knock John (U4) 

This artificial naval installation is similar in some respects to early &quot;fixed&quot; offshore oil platforms. It consisted of a rectangular reinforced concrete pontoon base with a support superstructure of two tall, diameter hollow reinforced concrete towers, walls roughly thick; overall weight is estimated to have been approximately 4,500 tons. The twin concrete supporting towers were divided into seven floors, four for crew quarters; the remainder provided dining, operational, and storage areas for several generators, and for fresh water tanks and antiaircraft munitions. There was a steel framework at one end supporting a landing jetty and crane which was used to hoist supplies aboard; the wooden landing stage itself became known as a &quot;dolphin&quot;.
The towers were joined above the eventual waterline by a steel platform deck upon which other structures could be added; this became a gun deck, on which an upper deck and a central tower unit were constructed. QF 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns were positioned at each end of this main deck, with a further two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns and the central tower radar installations atop a central living area that contained a galley, medical, and officers quarters.

The design of these concrete structures is equal to a military grade bunker, due to the ends of the stilts (under water), that are locked into the ground. Many species of fish live near the forts because the forts create cover. They have provided landmark references for shipping. They were laid down in dry dock and assembled as complete units. They were then fitted out—the crews going aboard at the same time for familiarization—before being towed out and sunk onto their sand bank positions in 1942.

The naval fort design was the latest of several that Maunsell had devised in response to Admiralty inquiries. Early ideas had considered forts in the English Channel able to combat enemy vessels.

During World War II, the Thames estuary Navy forts destroyed one German E-Boat.

===Rough Sands Fort (U1)===

Rough Sands fort was built to protect the ports of Felixstowe, Harwich and the town of Ipswich from aerial and sea attack. It is situated on Rough Sands, a sandbar located approximately from the coast of Suffolk and from the coast of Essex. Fort Roughs or the &quot;Rough Towers&quot; was &quot;the first of originally four naval forts designed by G. Maunsell to protect the Thames Estuary&quot;. The artificial sea fort was constructed in dry dock at Red Lion Wharf, Gravesend, and was commissioned &quot;H.M. Fort Roughs&quot; on 8 February 1942. After an eventful journey its grounding was supervised by Maunsell at 16:45 on 11 February 1942. With &quot;almost 100 men&quot; having earlier embarked at Tilbury docks, the fort began service immediately.

In 1966 Paddy Roy Bates, who operated Radio Essex, and Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly, who operated Radio Caroline, landed on Fort Roughs and occupied it. However, after disagreements, Roy Bates seized the tower as his own. O&#x27;Rahilly attempted to storm the fort in 1967, but Roy Bates defended the fort with guns and petrol bombs and continued to occupy it. The British Royal Marines were alerted and the British authorities ordered Roy Bates to surrender. He and his son were arrested and charged, but the court dismissed the case as it did not have jurisdiction over international affairs: Roughs Tower lay beyond the territorial waters of Britain. Bates took this as &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of his country and seven years later issued a constitution, flag, and national anthem, among other things, for the Principality of Sealand (founded on 2 September 1967).

===Sunk Head Fort (U2)===
Sunk Head fort was situated approximately from the coast off Essex and was grounded on 1 June 1942. The fort was decommissioned on 14 June 1945 though maintained until 1956 when it was abandoned. Unlike some of the other forts, Sunk Head was clearly well outside territorial waters, and when the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 came into effect in August 1967 the Government was anxious to ensure that it would not be taken over again by an offshore broadcaster. On 18 August 1967 Sunk Head was boarded by a contingent of the 24th Field Squadron of Royal Engineers from Maidstone from the tug Collie, commanded by Major David Ives. The Fort was weakened by acetylene cutting torches and 3,200 pounds of explosives were set. On 21 August 1967 Sunk Head was blown, leaving 20 feet of the leg stumps remaining.

===Tongue Sands Fort (U3)===
Tongue Sands Fort was situated approximately from the coast off Margate, Kent and was grounded on 27 June 1942. On the night of 22/23 January 1945, fifteen German E-boats were seen on radar, with five close by. The S.119 or S.199 operating out of IJmuiden, Holland was just over 4 miles away and came under heavy fire from Tongue Sands Fort&#x27;s 3.7-inch guns. The German E-Boat&#x27;s captain was unsure of where the attack was coming from and manoeuvred to avoid being hit, ramming another E-Boat in the process. The captain scuttled his badly damaged vessel.

The Tongue Sands Fort was decommissioned on 14 February 1945 and reduced to care and maintenance until 1949 when it was abandoned. The fort had settled badly when it was grounded and as a result became unstable. On 5 December 1947 the Fort shook violently and sections began falling into the sea. The caretaker crew sent a distress call and were rescued by &quot;HMS Uplifter&quot;. Divers later established that the foundations were solid, but in a later storm the fort took on a 15 degree list. During the mid-1960s under-scouring had further distorted the fort: large holes had appeared in east leg, sea water had flooded the lower levels and the platform had become detached with huge gaps between the deck. Tongue Sands Fort finally collapsed into the under-scouring hole during storms on 21/22 February 1996, leaving only a single 18 foot stump of the south leg remaining visible above sea level.

===Knock John Fort (U4)===

Knock John fort is situated approximately from the coast off Essex and was grounded on 1 August 1942. It was decommissioned on 14 June 1945 and evacuated on 25 June 1945. The platform was maintained until May 1956 when it was abandoned. In 2009, it was observed that there was a slight distortion of the legs when viewing the tower from west to east. It is thought that underscouring is the cause of this.

==Maunsell army forts==

Maunsell also designed forts for anti-aircraft defence. These were larger installations comprising seven connected steel platforms. Four towers arranged in a semicircle ahead of the control centre and accommodation each carried a QF 3.7-inch gun, a tower to the rear of the control centre mounted Bofors 40 mm guns, while the seventh tower, set to one side of the gun towers and further out, was the searchlight tower.

Three forts were placed in Liverpool Bay:
* &quot;Queens AA Towers&quot;
* &quot;Formby AA Towers&quot;
* &quot;Burbo AA Towers&quot;

and three in the Thames estuary:
* &quot;Nore&quot; (U5),
* &quot;Red Sands&quot; (U6)
* &quot;Shivering Sands&quot; (U7)

The Mersey forts were constructed at Bromborough Dock and the Thames forts at Gravesend. Proposals to construct forts off the Humber, Portsmouth &amp; Rosyth, Belfast &amp; Londonderry came to nothing. During World War II, the Thames estuary forts shot down 22 aircraft and about 30 flying bombs; they were decommissioned by the Ministry of Defence during the late 1950s.

===Nore Fort (U5)===

Nore fort was the only one built in British territorial waters at the time it was established. Other forts were in international waters until the three-mile limit was extended to . The fort was damaged badly in 1953 during a storm, then later in the year a Norwegian ship, &quot;Baalbek&quot;, collided with it, destroying two of the towers, killing four civilians and destroying guns, radar equipment and supplies. The ruins were considered a hazard to shipping and dismantled in 1959–1960. Parts of the bases were towed ashore by the Cliffe fort at Alpha wharf near the village of Cliffe, Kent, where they were still visible at low tide.
===Red Sands Fort (U6)===

There are seven towers in the Red Sands group at the mouth of the Thames Estuary. The towers had been connected by metal grate walk-ways. In 1959 consideration was given to refloating the Red Sands Fort and bringing the towers ashore but the costs were prohibitive.

Radio 390 (1965–1967) was a pirate radio station on Red Sands Fort. During that time, the fort was also used as the setting for the third season finale episode, &quot;Not So Jolly Roger&quot; (first aired on 7 April 1966), of the 1960&#x27;s UK television series Danger Man (known as Secret Agent in the U.S.) starring Patrick McGoohan; that episode concerned a pirate radio station that was a front for spies passing on secrets, and included substantial scenes filmed on location at the fort.

During the early 21st century, in response to proposals to demolish the fort, a group named Project Redsands was formed to try to preserve it. It was the only fort that could be visited safely from a platform in between the legs of one of the towers. The fort was inspected by the structural engineering company Structural Repairs in 2021. They found that 6 of the towers had severe structural defects, with elements already lost to the sea, the 7th tower also had the same defects, with elements due to imminently fall into the sea. The fort could not be accessed safely in its present condition.

===Shivering Sands Fort (U7)===
This group was built near the Thames estuary for anti-aircraft defence and made up of several towers north of Herne Bay from the nearest land. One of the seven towers collapsed in 1963 when fog caused the ship &quot;Ribersborg&quot; to stray off course and collide with one of the towers. In 1964, the Port of London Authority placed wind and tide monitoring equipment on the Shivering Sands searchlight tower, which was isolated from the rest of the fort by the demolished tower. This relayed data to the mainland via a radio link. In August and September 2005, artist Stephen Turner spent six weeks living alone in the searchlight tower of the Shivering Sands Fort in what he described as &quot;an artistic exploration of isolation, investigating how one&#x27;s experience of time changes in isolation, and what creative contemplation means in a 21st-century context&quot;.

===Liverpool Army Forts===
The Liverpool sea forts were constructed in the same way the forts in the Thames estuary were; they were designed to defend Liverpool and the industrial heartland of Liverpool from an aerial attack from the west. Originally 38 towers were intended to be built but only 21 towers were built (three forts). The forts were built from October 1941. No fort engaged in enemy action during WWII. Demolition of the structures started during the 1950s with these forts considered a priority over the Thames estuary ports due to being a hazard to shipping. Demolition was delayed in 1954 when the salvage ship working at Queens Fort was diverted to assist with the urgent demolition of The Nore Fort in the Thames Estuary, which had been damaged due to a collision with a Norwegian ship, leaving remains considered hazardous to shipping in the area. Demolition of the three forts was completed in 1955.

==Illicit radio stations==
Various forts were re-occupied for pirate radio during the mid-1960s.
In 1964, a few months after Radios Caroline and Atlanta began broadcasting, Screaming Lord Sutch installed Radio Sutch in one of the towers at Shivering Sands. Sutch soon became bored with the project and sold the station to Reginald Calvert who had assisted in establishing the station and who renamed the station Radio City and expanded operations into all of the five towers that remained connected. Calvert&#x27;s killing in a dispute concerning the station&#x27;s ownership (found to be self-defence rather than murder) contributed to the Government passing legislation against the offshore stations in 1967.

During the illicit radio era the Port of London Authority frequently complained that its monitoring radio link was being disrupted by the nearby Radio City transmitter.
Red Sands was likewise occupied by Radio Invicta, which was renamed KING Radio and then Radio 390, after its wavelength of approximately 390 metres. The station&#x27;s managing director was ex-spy and thriller writer Ted Allbeury.

The size of the Army forts made them ideal antenna platforms, since a large antenna could be based on the central tower and guyed from the surrounding towers.

A small group of radio enthusiasts established Radio Tower on Sunk Head Naval fort, but the station had a small budget, had poor coverage and lasted only a few months. Claims by the group that they also intended to provide television service from the fort were never credible. In order to prevent further illicit broadcasting, a team of Royal Engineers laid 2,200 lbs of explosive charges on Sunk Head, commencing on 18 August 1967. At 4:18 PM on 21 August the charges were detonated, destroying the entire superstructure and most of the concrete legs above the waterline.

Paddy Roy Bates occupied the Knock John Fort in 1965 and established Radio Essex, later renamed BBMS—Britain&#x27;s Better Music Station, but was better known for his post-pirate activities. After the termination of BBMS in late 1966 he moved the station&#x27;s equipment to Roughs Tower, further from the coast, but did not recommence broadcasting. He, or a representative, has lived in Roughs Tower since 1967, self-styling the tower as the Principality of Sealand.

==Cultural references==
The 1966 television series &quot;Danger Man&quot; episode &quot;Not-so-Jolly Roger&quot; was filmed partly at Redsands Army Sea Fort and includes an acknowledgement to Radio 390 in its closing credits. Redsands Fort was also used for the 1968 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot;, in which the complex stood in for a North Sea gas refinery besieged by an intelligent seaweed creature. In the 2020 film &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot;, the Redsands towers, seen from the air, appear as the exterior of a secret MI6 interrogation centre. In the 2013 movie The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, as the characters travel in a train along the coast, two Sea Forts can be seen in the water.

The Red Sands Fort and Radio City feature in the glam rock band Slade&#x27;s movie, &quot;Slade in Flame&quot;. The newly formed band, Flame, are interviewed by the pirate radio station, just as an attack is begun on the forts.

The Shivering Sands Forts, filmed from a North Sea ferry, appeared in the 1984 music video for the song &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;, by the Irish popular music band U2.

The 2002 video game &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; features the forts during the dragon campaign, where remnants of British Armed Forces make a last stand during a dragon apocalypse.

The 2015 video game &quot;Stranded Deep&quot; includes abandoned Sea Forts that have the appearance of Maunsell Army Forts. These are difficult-to-find Easter Eggs built into the game for players to explore.

The setting of the 2023 science fiction film &quot;Last Sentinel&quot; is based on a structure modelled after a single tower of the Maunsell army forts. 

The Red Sands Forts are seen in Episode 1 of Whitstable Pearl, mentioned as a drop-off and pick-up point for illicit drugs, as part of the story.

<text>The Division of Corangamite () is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It is named for Lake Corangamite, although the lake no longer falls within the division&#x27;s boundaries.

The division was redrawn in 2021, becoming a much smaller seat due to increased population growth. It now covers (down from ) along the Victorian coast, including the growing surf coast area, the southern suburbs of Geelong as well as rural areas to the west. Starting at in the east, the electorate takes in the entire Bellarine Peninsula, then runs down the surf coast as far as . The electorate then extends north into the Golden Plains Shire, where it includes the towns of , and .

Since the 2019 federal election, the current Member for Corangamite is Libby Coker, a member of the Australian Labor Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

Until the 1930s it was usually a marginal seat which leaned toward the conservative parties, but was won by the Australian Labor Party during high-tide elections. In 1918, it was the first seat won by what would become the Country Party.

It was held by the Liberals (and their immediate predecessor, the United Australia Party) without interruption from 1934 to 2007. A reasonably safe seat for most of the time from the 1950s to the 1990s, it became increasingly less safe from 1998 onward as successive redistributions pushed it further into Geelong. This resulted in the seat falling to Darren Cheeseman, the Labor candidate, by less than one percent at the 2007 federal election for the first time since 1929. Cheeseman was only the third Labor member ever to win the seat. Labor retained the seat in 2010 election against former journalist Sarah Henderson, making Cheeseman the first Labor MP to win re-election in the seat. Henderson sought a rematch in 2013, and won.

Henderson retained her seat in 2016 but a redistribution completed prior to the 2019 election pushed the seat further into Geelong. This resulted in the seat becoming notionally Labor, albeit with a very narrow margin. As Henderson failed to gain a swing towards her at the election, she lost the seat to the Labor candidate, Libby Coker. Coker&#x27;s win in 2019 was historically significant, as it marked the first time that the non-Labor parties had been in government without holding Corangamite.

In 2018, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) published its report on the proposed redistribution of Victoria&#x27;s federal divisions. The report proposed renaming Corangamite to Cox, after swimming instructor May Cox. Incumbent MP Sarah Henderson said the new name &quot;has already prompted some ridicule on social media&quot;, due to &quot;Cox&quot; being a homophone of &quot;cocks&quot;. In the commission&#x27;s final determination, the decision was made to retain the name of Corangamite. In 2021, the AEC again proposed to rename Corangamite, this time to Tucker after Aboriginal activist Margaret Tucker, however in the final determination, the renaming proposal was also abandoned over concerns that the name would be vandalised as &quot;Fucker&quot;. In the same 2021 redistribution, the seat was shrunk even further towards Geelong, losing its western half to the adjacent seat of Wannon and the north to Ballarat.

In July 2021, City of Greater Geelong Mayor and Bellarine Ward Councillor Stephanie Asher was preselected as the Liberal candidate for Corangamite. 
 However, Coker won a second term with 57 percent of the two-party vote, a swing of six percent. This was the strongest showing for Labor in the seat’s history.

In 2024, it was proposed that the seat be shrunk further towards Geelong and lose its western half to Corio and Wannon. Between the 2010 and 2021 redistributions, the seat has shrunk from to , an approximately 80% decrease in size and will further shrink if and when the 2024 redistribution is finalised.

Prominent members of the seat have included James Scullin, who later became the Prime Minister of Australia in 1929-32; Fraser government Minister Tony Street and longtime Liberal backbencher Stewart McArthur.

<doc id="1036490" wikidata="Q1066298" url="?curid=1036490" title="Print Screen">
<text>Print Screen (often abbreviated Print Scrn, Prnt Scrn, Prnt Scr, Prt Scrn, Prt Scn, Prt Scr, Prt Sc, Pr Sc, or PS) is a key present on most PC keyboards. It is typically situated in the same section as the break key and scroll lock key. The print screen may share the same key as system request.

==Original use==
Under command-line based operating systems such as MS-DOS, this key causes the contents of the current text mode screen memory buffer to be copied to the standard printer port, usually LPT1. In essence, whatever is currently on the screen when the key is pressed will be printed. Pressing the key in combination with turns on and off the &quot;printer echo&quot; feature. When echo is in effect, any conventional text output to the screen will be copied (&quot;echoed&quot;) to the printer. There is also a Unicode character for print screen, .

==Modern use==
Newer-generation operating systems using a graphical interface tend to save a bitmap image of the current screen, or screenshot, to their clipboard or comparable storage area. Some shells allow modification of the exact behavior using modifier keys such as the control key.

In Microsoft Windows, pressing will capture the entire screen, while pressing the key in combination with will capture the currently selected window. The captured image can then be pasted into an editing program such as a graphics program or even a word processor. Pressing with both the left key and left pressed turns on a high contrast mode (this keyboard shortcut can be turned off by the user). Since Windows 8, pressing the key in combination with (and optionally in addition to the key) will save the captured image to disk (the default pictures location). This behavior is therefore backward compatible with users who learned Print Screen actions under operating systems such as MS-DOS. In Windows 10, the key can be configured to open the &#x27;New&#x27; function of the Snip &amp; Sketch tool. This allows the user to take a full screen, specific window, or defined area screenshot and copy it to clipboard. This behaviour can be enabled by going to Snip &amp; Sketch, accessing Settings via the menu and enabling the &#x27;Use the PrtScn button to open screen snipping&#x27;.

In KDE and GNOME, very similar shortcuts are available, which open a screenshot tool (Spectacle or GNOME Screenshot respectively), giving options to save the screenshot, plus more options like manually picking a specific window, screen area, using a timeout, etc. Sending the image to many services (KDE), or even screen recording (GNOME), is built-in too.

Macintosh does not use a print screen key; instead, key combinations are used that start with . These key combinations are used to provide more functionality including the ability to select screen objects. captures the whole screen, while allows for part of the screen to be selected. The standard print screen functions described above save the image to the desktop. However, using any of the key sequences described above, but additionally pressing the will modify the behavior to copy the image to the system clipboard instead.

==Notable keyboards==
On the IBM Model F keyboard, the key is labeled PrtSc and is located under . On the IBM Model M, it is located next to and is labeled Print Screen.

<text>The city of Utrecht and the surrounding cities, villages, and townships form an agglomeration in the middle of The Netherlands. It is located entirely in the province of Utrecht, and is the eastern part of so-called North Wing the larger Randstad urban area.

The agglomeration has a population of about 690,000 people (a rough estimate based on data collected in 2001–2012). The following towns are commonly recognized as part of the agglomeration:
This interpretation of what is to be acknowledged the greater Utrecht area, is the most common one. The physically joint urban area (the innercity-Utrecht area and its surrounding authentic quarters, boroughs and outskirts; the town of Maarssen, which is connected to Utrecht by the Utrecht district of Zuilen and the Lage Weide industrial area; Nieuwegein which has grown attached to the south of the city during the seventies and nineties. To which are attached the smaller suburban towns of IJsselstein and Vianen; the former villages of De Meern and Vleuten, which have been annexed - also formally - by the Utrecht municipality and the western city expansion of Leidsche Rijn; the chained towns of De Bilt and Bilthoven, who are nearly connected to the east side of the city with less than a mile of recreational areas and infrastructure separating both) houses around half a million people. The other 100–200.000 inhabitants making up the entire agglomeration population mostly live in slightly more distant towns such as Zeist, Bunnik, Houten, Breukelen etc. These suburban towns and villages are situated, averagely about four of five miles from the outer districts of Utrecht city. 
The larger economic, cultural and educational area of which the city of Utrecht is the main centre is equal to the province of Utrecht excluding the small agglomeration of Amersfoort and the town of Veenendaal (which are more self-sufficient and self-orientated). It provides shopping facilities, employment, some large hospitals, cinemas, recreation and other facilities for around 800.000 people. If Woerden, Breukelen and Culemborg are to by included in the greater Utrecht area (seen the vast forensism towards the city) the population would be around 750.000.

In the 1970s and 1980s, large residential areas were built in Maarssen and Zeist, as well as in the new town Nieuwegein. In the 1990s, construction of new houses was concentrated in the new town Houten and in the Leidsche Rijn neighbourhood.

<doc id="1036495" wikidata="Q7777537" url="?curid=1036495" title="Theatre of the Ridiculous">
<text>Theatre of the Ridiculous is a theatrical genre that began in New York City in the 1960s.

== Beginnings of the genre==
The phrase &quot;Theatre of the Ridiculous&quot; was created in 1965 by actor and director Ronald Tavel to describe his own work, which was later recognized as the beginning of the genre. Referencing Martin Esslin&#x27;s concept of a Theatre of the Absurd, Tavel promoted the first Ridiculous performances with the manifesto: &quot;We have passed beyond the absurd: our position is absolutely preposterous.&quot; Theatre of the Ridiculous broke from the dominant trends in theater of naturalistic acting and realistic settings. The genre employed a broad acting style, often with surrealistic stage settings and props, and frequently made a conscious effort to be shocking or disturbing.

Ridiculous theatre brought elements of queer and/or camp performance to experimental theater. Cross-gender casting was common, as was casting non-professional actors, such as drag queens or other &quot;street stars&quot;. Ridiculous plays were often parodies or adaptations of popular culture, used as vehicles for social commentary and/or humour. Improvisation played a significant role in the often chaotic Ridiculous productions, with the script used as a starting point.

Prominent works from the genre include:

*&quot;Camille&quot;
*&quot;The Life of Lady Godiva&quot;
*&quot;Conquest of the Universe&quot;
*&quot;When Queens Collide&quot;
*&quot;The Mystery of Irma Vep&quot;

==The Play-House of the Ridiculous and the Ridiculous Theatrical Company==

The Play-House of the Ridiculous was a theatrical ensemble founded by John Vaccaro in the mid-1960s. The ensemble first produced works written by Tavel, beginning with &quot;Shower&quot; and &quot;The Life of Juanita Castro&quot;, which were originally intended as films to be produced at Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory. When these works were rejected by The Factory, Tavel decided to have them performed as plays, producing them together on a double-bill called &quot;Theater of the Ridiculous&quot;.

&quot;The Life of Lady Godiva&quot;, written by Ronald Tavel and directed by Vaccaro in 1967, was the first official production of the Play-House of the Ridiculous. Charles Ludlam, who would become a major figure in the &quot;Ridiculous&quot; genre, acted in the play as a last-minute replacement.

Vaccaro then directed a play written by Ludlam, &quot;Big Hotel&quot;, which opened in an East Village loft in February 1967. David Kaufman, discussing &quot;Big Hotel&quot;, has said: &quot;Various features of Ludlam&#x27;s 28 subsequent works figure prominently in his first play. His predilection for collage - folding in cultural references, both popular and obscure - is especially pronounced. Characters include Mata Hari, Trilby, Svengali and Santa Claus, and Ludlam acknowledged no fewer than 40 sources for &quot;Big Hotel&quot; - everything from ads and Hollywood films to literary classics, textbooks and essays.&quot;

Ludlam wrote a second play for the Play-House, &quot;Conquest of the Universe&quot;, but during rehearsals Ludlam and Vaccaro had a disagreement. Ludlam left to form his own company, which he named The Ridiculous Theatrical Group, and took many of the Play-House actors with him. Vaccaro held the rights to &quot;Conquest of the Universe&quot;, and was able to perform it first, delaying the production of Ludlam&#x27;s competing version (called &quot;When Queens Collide&quot;) for several months.

Vaccaro&#x27;s &quot;Conquest of the Universe&quot; was performed at the Bouwerie Lane Theatre with many members of Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory, including Mary Woronov, Taylor Mead, Ondine, and Ultra Violet. The Play-House of the Ridiculous was a resident company at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan.

===Gay themes===

Vaccaro&#x27;s Play-House of the Ridiculous and Ludlam&#x27;s Ridiculous Theatrical Company had similar approaches to gay themes. Both ensembles used cross-gender casting, often recruiting drag queens as actors.

One perspective of the Play-House of the Ridiculous is that they were reluctant to address queer themes. According to Ludlam, the Ridiculous Theatrical Company&#x27;s productions were more daring: &quot;I felt John [Vaccaro] was too conservative. He didn&#x27;t want homosexuality or nudity onstage because he was afraid of being arrested. I wanted to commit an outrage. For me, nothing was too far out.&quot; Another perspective is that Ludlam&#x27;s productions were too close to conventional comedy, while Vacarro&#x27;s work was more challenging, emphasizing social commentary. Leee Black Childers was quoted in Legs McNeil&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Please Kill Me&quot;:
In my opinion, John Vaccaro was more important than Charles Ludlam, because Ludlam followed theatrical traditions and used a lot of drag. People felt very comfortable with Charles Ludlam. Everyone&#x27;s attitude going to see Charles&#x27;s plays was that they were going to see a really funny, irreverent, slapstick drag show. They never felt embarrassed.

But John Vaccaro was way past that. Way, way past that. John Vaccaro was dangerous. John Vaccaro could be very embarrassing on many levels. He used thalidomide babies and Siamese triplets joined together at the asshole. One actor had this huge papier-mache prop of a big cock coming out of his shorts, down to his knees. He also couldn&#x27;t control his bowel movements, so shit was dripping down his legs the whole time and everyone loved it. People loved this kind of visually confrontational theater.
Vaccaro and Ludlam had different attitudes toward gayness and the theater. Ludlam talked about how the theatre had always been a refuge for gay people, and made clear that gay themes were important to his work. For Vaccaro, gayness was one theme among many that he used. Vaccaro made a distinction between theater people and gay people using the theater for camp and/or drag performances.

Ludlam did object to being identified solely as a gay, female impersonator who produced works that were merely camp. Morris Meyer commented on Ludlam&#x27;s ambivalence when discussing an interview he conducted with Ludlam: &quot;During a subsequent run of &quot;Camille&quot; in 1974, he argued emphatically two seemingly contradictory positions for his production. He maintained that his rendering of &quot;Camille&quot; is not an expression of homosexuality and, at the same time, that it represents a form of coming out.&quot;

Cross-gender performance was central to Ludlam&#x27;s work. Ludlam discussed his role as the Emerald Empress in Bill Vehr&#x27;s &quot;Whores of Babylon&quot;:

Bill wrote this line in &quot;Whores of Babylon&quot; in which his character said to mine, &quot;How well I understand that struggle in you between the warrior artist and the woman&quot; – this was a wonderful self-revelation – and my line, he wrote, was &quot;&quot;The&quot; woman? Don&#x27;t you know there are a thousand women in me and I&#x27;m tormented by each one in turn?

==Cultural influence==

Theatre of the Ridiculous had a strong influence on 1970s culture. Elements of the genre can be seen in glam rock, disco, and in the &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. The genre has also influenced more mainstream productions, such as &quot;Bat Boy&quot;, &quot;Urinetown&quot;, and &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;. Scott Miller cites the Play-House of the Ridiculous as a key source of &quot;a performance style that only recently is becoming mainstream, a style described by &quot;Bat Boy&quot;″s original director and co-author Keythe Farley as &#x27;the height of expression, the depth of sincerity,&#x27; a kind of outrageous but utterly truthful acting.&quot; Taylor Mac also credits Theatre of the Ridiculous as one of his professional influences.

Concerning 1970s fashion, Childers has said:
... John Vaccaro used tons of glitter, that was his trademark. Everyone wore glitter. The whole cast was always covered in glitter.

People had been wearing glitter for a long time and the drag queens were wearing it on the street, but I think &quot;glitter&#x27; really took off when John Vaccaro went shopping for costume material and he came across this little place in Chinatown that was having a big clearance sale on their glitter. He bought it all – giant shopping-bag-size bags of glitter in all colors.

John brought it back to the theater and encouraged everyone to use as much of it as they possibly could, anywhere they could possibly put it. Of course their faces were covered with glitter, their hair was full of glitter, the actors who played the Moon Reindeer had their entire bodies covered in green glitter. Baby Betty, who was playing a thalidomide baby, had glitter coming out of her pussy – so it was because of John Vaccaro that glitter became synonymous with outrageousness.
The Play-House of the Ridiculous connected Warhol&#x27;s Factory with the punk culture developing in the mid-1970s. Patti Smith performed in a play written by Jackie Curtis called &quot;Femme Fatale.&quot; According to Jayne County, also known as Wayne County: &quot;Actually, it was [a] simulation of shooting up speed while shrieking, &#x27;Brian Jones is dead!&#x27; That was Patti Smith&#x27;s big moment on the New York underground stage.&quot;

Lou Reed has attributed the origins of Rocky Horror and its cult following to the Theatre of the Ridiculous.

==John Vaccaro==

Ludlam wrote of Vaccaro: &quot;John has great instinct and is a brilliant actor. He gave me freedom. He allowed me to flip out all I wanted onstage. He never felt that I was too pasty, corny, mannered, campy. He let me do anything I wanted.&quot;

Vaccaro was known for being a challenge to work with, as when he kicked Jackie Curtis out of a production of a play that Curtis had written (&quot;Heaven Grand In Amber Orbit&quot;). Ludlam also wrote: &quot;He is very primitive and very difficult for most actors to work with, because he&#x27;s sort of savage. He gets you into doing things by rote. He criticizes ideas without giving any suggestions for , and then makes you do it over and over again. It&#x27;s psychological torture.&quot; Similarly, Childers has said: &quot;John Vaccaro was a very difficult man to work with because he used anger to draw a performance out of a person.&quot;

John Vaccaro died on August 7, 2016, at the age of 86.

<text>New Tavern Fort is an historic artillery fort in Gravesend, Kent. Dating mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, it is an unusually well-preserved example of an 18th-century fortification and remained in use for defensive purposes until the Second World War. It was built during the American War of Independence to guard the Thames against French and Spanish raiders operating in support of the newly formed United States of America. It was redesigned and rebuilt in the mid-19th century to defend against a new generation of iron-clad French warships.

By the start of the 20th century, the Thames defences had been moved further downriver to the estuary and the fort was disarmed. Its grounds were opened to the public as pleasure gardens, but the fort was temporarily taken back into military use during the Second World War. Today the fort and its magazines and other underground structures have been restored and are open to the public. It is unique in the UK for its display of guns and emplacements ranging from the 18th to the 20th centuries.

==Description==

===Ramparts and emplacements===

The fort is situated on the south bank of the River Thames, intended to support the much older Tilbury Fort on the north bank. The structure consists of a broad earthen rampart constructed in a zig-zag pattern, with a broad ditch in front of it. Eight emplacements, six of brick and two of concrete, are contained within the rampart with magazines underneath them. The interior of the fort - originally its parade ground - is occupied by a grass-covered lawn with flowerbeds, trees, ornamental bushes and a bandstand at the centre.

The ramparts face the river and can be divided into three sectors. The northern sector, originally called the North Face, contains two concrete semi-circular emplacements in which two 6&quot; breech-loading guns were installed in 1904. They are still occupied by guns of this type, though not the originals; this makes New Tavern Fort the only example in the UK of a fully re-armed two-gun 6&quot; battery for breech-loading guns. A concrete fire position is located immediately to the west and the remains of its instrument pillar can still be seen.

The middle sector - the easternmost part of the north rampart - was originally known as the Garden Face for its proximity to the gardens in the interior of the fort. It contains four brick emplacements built in 1868–72 to house rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns. One is protected by a thick iron shield with a gun-port in the middle, while the other three have unprotected open embrasures. All four are very well-preserved and still retain the rails on which the guns traversed. Doors on either side give access to the ammunition shafts which brought shells and cartridges up from the magazine. The shielded embrasure has been re-armed with an RML gun, making it a rare example of an embrasure of this type that has retained its original appearance.

The southern sector of the rampart was known as the East Face, for its direction facing the river. It incorporates two small brick emplacements constructed in the 1860s. They originally housed a pair of traversing guns that fired &quot;en barbette&quot;.

===Magazines and other features===

The entrance to the magazines is in the middle rampart and gives access to a and brick tunnel which zig-zags under the rampart. Sixteen storage rooms serving as expense magazines for cartridges and shells are situated off the tunnel, with ammunition lifts linking them to the gun positions above. The main magazine consisted of two cartridge and shell stores, from where the ammunition would be transported along the tunnel to the smaller expense stores. To ensure that there was no possibility of sparks or naked flames causing explosions, safety lighting was provided from behind glass screens while the magazine workers had to wear special magazine slippers and safety clothing to ensure that they could not create sparks when they moved.

The magazines have been partly refurbished with displays illustrating how they were used and exhibits relating to the military history of Gravesend, and are open as a visitor attraction on summer weekends. A separate brick-arched magazine lies below the north rampart and was used to store ammunition for the 6″ guns, as well as a fire appliance.

A wide ditch lies in front of the ramparts. Its width was increased in the 1860s, when it originally contained a fence intended to serve as an obstacle to attacking infantry. It is now filled with ornamental plants, pools and paths, and is designated as a nature area.

Almost nothing now remains of the original internal barracks and administration buildings. The only substantial exception is the medieval Milton Chantry, the oldest building in Gravesend, which was used as a barracks.

==History==

===Strategic context===

The lower Thames was of great strategic significance as the location of major military installations including the dockyard and arsenal at Woolwich, the powder magazine at Purfleet, and the victualling stores and shipyard at Deptford. In addition, it was essential to ensure that an enemy could not make a landing along the Thames, which offered a potential land corridor to London. The crossing between Gravesend and Tilbury was also of considerable importance, which had prompted the Tudors to build fortifications on both sides of the river at that point.

The impetus for the construction of New Tavern Fort came from the threat posed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s adversaries in the American War of Independence - the newly created United States of America and its European allies, France and Spain. Serious weaknesses in British coastal defences had been revealed in 1778 by the American adventurer John Paul Jones in his raid on Whitehaven, Cumbria. The activities of his squadron on the British east coast the following year, along with the failed Franco-Spanish Armada of 1779, prompted the British government to commission a survey of the country&#x27;s coastal defences. The state of the defences was found to be unacceptably deficient and plans were made for the building of 30 new batteries, positioned in an arc along the southern and eastern English coast from Norfolk to Cornwall.

The Thames portion of the survey was carried out by the engineer Thomas Hyde Page. He recommended the refurbishment of the existing Tudor-era Tilbury Fort on the riverbank opposite Gravesend, and the construction of an entirely new fort to replace the older Gravesend Blockhouse, another Tudor-era fortification of which only traces now remain. The new fort would be located to the east of the blockhouse, where it would have a greater reach downriver and would be able to cross its fire with that of Tilbury Fort. With fears increasing of a French invasion in support of their American allies, the government approved Page&#x27;s proposals and construction began soon afterwards.

===Construction and early years===

The fort was constructed between 1780 and 1783 on a site originally occupied by the New Tavern Inn, from which it took its name. As the land was private property occupied by a Mr. Houghton, a vesting act (the Plymouth, Sheerness, Gravesend, Tilbury – Fortifications Act 1780, 20 Geo. 3. c. 38) was passed to purchase it. It was originally an irregularly shaped unrevetted earthwork consisting of two batteries linked by a rampart. The first battery had two faces forming an angle towards the river, while the second smaller battery had a straight front. It was protected on the riverside by a flat-bottomed ditch within which was a pallisade made of timber standing about high. The two batteries were armed with fifteen heavy guns (24 and 32 pdrs.) which fired through embrasures.

Milton Chantry was incorporated into the fort&#x27;s perimeter and was converted into an artillery barracks. By the 1790s, additional buildings had been constructed, including quarters for the commanding officer, stables and magazines. The rear of the fort was originally open, but by the end of the 18th century a defence wall and caponier with loopholes for muskets had been built to close it off. A kiln was also built to heat shot to a red heat for setting ships on fire.

===19th century reconstructions===

During the 19th century, New Tavern Fort underwent major reconstructions, though it retained its basic plan and earthworks. The gun emplacements were modernised in 1848 to install platforms for traversing guns, and further magazines were built. Further upgrades were soon needed. By the end of the 1850s, Britain and France were engaged in a naval arms race. A new class of ironclad ships with powerful rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns, exemplified by the British HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; and the French &quot;La Gloire&quot;, posed a substantial threat to existing coastal defences. In response, the British government established a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom to review the defences and make recommendations on improvements. Noting the importance of the Thames and its vulnerability to seaborne attack, the Commission advocated in its report in 1860 that two principal lines of defence should be established along the Thames. Three forts would be constructed or rebuilt - Shornemead Fort and Cliffe Fort in Kent and Coalhouse Fort in Essex - to provide an outer line of defence, with further forts and batteries protecting key sites further downriver. The inner line of defence would be provided by Tilbury Fort and New Tavern Fort.

The fort underwent one more rearming before the Commissioners&#x27; recommendations were put into effect. Its existing guns were replaced in 1859 by ten 68-pounder guns, among the most powerful smooth-bore guns in service at the time, with a range of up to . Two of the 68-pdrs. were replaced by 1865 with a pair of 10-inch shell guns, with a further 8-inch shell gun added, though all were still smooth-bore guns. Four early breech-loading RBL 40 pounder Armstrong guns mounted on field carriages had replaced the earlier movable guns in 1862.

The focus of the Army&#x27;s fortification efforts was initially on the outer forts at Coalhouse Point, Cliffe and Shornemead, and it was not until January 1868 that instructions were issued by the War Office to reconstruct Tilbury and New Tavern Forts. The existing magazines and ramparts were demolished and new brick emplacements were built, on which were mounted ten 9-inch and one 12-inch RML guns capable of ranges of up to . Seven of the emplacements were protected by iron shields. The ramparts were extensively remodelled to accommodate new magazines, which were connected via lift shafts to serving rooms adjoining the emplacements. Colonel (later General) Charles George Gordon, who was to become famous for his death in the Siege of Khartoum in 1885, lived in Fort House in the grounds of the fort between 1865 and 1871 while he was overseeing the project.

===20th century===

The fort had lost much of its importance by the turn of the 20th century. Advances in naval firepower meant that the principal line of defence for the Thames had been moved downriver to the batteries at Grain and Shoeburyness, where bigger guns with a longer range could control the entire estuary mouth. The old RML guns were now obsolete, while the emplacements provided little protection against modern naval artillery. A War Office report of 1887-8 commented that New Tavern Fort&#x27;s &quot;guns are crowded, and behind weak parapets; the parapets should be revised, and the number of guns reduced, so that they may be more effectively mounted.&quot; Proposals were advanced for this to be done and for the range of the guns to be extended by remounting them on modified carriages, but neither of these improvements were implemented.

In 1905 the RML emplacements were replaced with two concrete pits for a pair of 6-inch breech-loading guns with a range of , with separate magazines constructed to support them. They were only emplaced for a few years and the fort was disarmed before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and was rearmed in 1930 with a pair of replacement 6-inch guns, used to train the Territorial Army&#x27;s Gravesend battery. At the same time, the Gravesend Corporation purchased the interior of the fort. The interior of the fort was opened to the public in 1932 as a pleasure garden, though the battery remained in use until 1938. Some of the fort&#x27;s internal structures were also demolished at this time.

Although it was no longer armed, New Tavern Fort continued to serve military purposes during the Second World War. A pair of communications masts were built on top of the disused magazines to support a naval radio monitoring station. Oral testimony suggests that the station was used to intercept enemy radio communications which were taken to Bletchley Park for decryption. The Admiralty requisitioned the magazines in 1941 to utilise them and the connecting tunnels as air raid shelters for HMS Gordon, a naval shore establishment based in the nearby Sea School.

Following the war, the fort was reopened to the public as a garden. Fort House, the Commanding Royal Engineer&#x27;s residence, was so badly damaged by a nearby V-2 rocket strike in 1944 that it had to be demolished; part of the Milton Chantry complex was also demolished in 1948. The Chantry&#x27;s chapel was reused as Gravesend Historical Society&#x27;s museum of local history from 1953 to 1970. In 1969, much of the rest of the Chantry was demolished. The remainder was taken into state guardianship in 1972 and became a heritage centre operated by Gravesham Borough Council.

===Today===

Today the fort forms part of Gravesham Borough Council&#x27;s Riverside Leisure Area. Its surface area is open all year round and the restored magazines are opened on summer weekends by a local heritage group. Restoration got underway in 1975, and in 1977 the fort was given a Grade II* listing for its architectural and historic interest, reflecting the unusual complete example that it presents.

Two salvaged 6-inch guns were reinstalled in the fort in the 1980s, making it the only completely armed two-gun battery of its type in the UK mainland. The magazines have also been refurbished and re-equipped to an extent that is unique in the UK. The fort&#x27;s display of guns and emplacements dating from the 18th to the 20th century is also unique.

<text>The System of Nature or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World (French: ) is a 1770 work of philosophy by Paul-Henri Thiry, Baron d&#x27;Holbach.

==Overview==

The work was originally published under the name of Jean-Baptiste de Mirabaud, a deceased member of the French Academy of Science. D&#x27;Holbach wrote and published this book – possibly with the assistance of Denis Diderot but with the support of Jacques-André Naigeon – anonymously in 1770, describing the universe in terms of the principles of philosophical materialism: the mind is identified with the brain, there is no &quot;soul&quot; without a living body, the world is governed by strict deterministic laws, free will is an illusion, there are no final causes, and whatever happens takes place because it inexorably must. The work explicitly denies the existence of God, arguing that belief in a higher being is the product of fear, lack of understanding, and anthropomorphism.

Though not a scientist himself, d&#x27;Holbach was scientifically literate and he tried to develop his philosophy in accordance with the known facts of nature and the scientific knowledge of the day, citing, for example, the experiments of John Needham as proof that life could develop autonomously without the intervention of a deity. It makes a critical distinction between mythology as a more or less benign way of bringing law-ordered thought on society, nature and their powers to the masses and theology. Theology which, when it separates from mythology raises the power of nature above nature itself and thus alienates the two (i.e. &quot;nature&quot;, all that actually exists, from its power, now personified in a being outside nature), is by contrast a pernicious force in human affairs without parallel. Its principles are summed up in a more popular form in d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s .

==Criticism==

The book was considered extremely radical in its day and the list of people writing refutations of the work was long. The Catholic theologian Nicolas-Sylvestre Bergier wrote a refutation titled &quot;Examen du matérialisme&quot; (&quot;Materialism examined&quot;). Voltaire, too, seized his pen to refute the philosophy of the in the article &quot;Dieu&quot; in his &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot;, while Frederick the Great also drew up an answer to it. Commenting on the book, Frederick observed: 

It is speculated that Frederick was motivated to write a criticism of the &quot;System of Nature&quot; because the book contained an attack not just on religion, but also on monarchy.

==Appreciation and influence==
D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s friend Denis Diderot had enthusiastically endorsed the book:

Percy Bysshe Shelley became an ardent atheist after reading &quot;The System of Nature&quot;, and proceeded to translate the book into English. According to Will Durant, the &quot;System of Nature&quot; contains the most comprehensive description of materialism and atheism in the entire history of philosophy.

In his student days, Goethe had recoiled with revulsion at the contents in the book: &quot;It appeared to us so grey, so Cimmerian, so corpse – like that we had difficulty in enduring its presence and shuddered before it as before a spectre&quot;; in his old age he harbored similar views: &quot;We belong to the laws of nature, even when we rebel against them.&quot;

According to Voltaire, the book was very popular among the populace, including &quot;scholars, the ignorant, and women&quot;.

<text>Shornemead Fort is a now-disused artillery fort that was built in the 1860s to guard the entrance to the Thames from seaborne attack. Constructed during a period of tension with France, it stands on the south bank of the river at a point where the Thames curves sharply north and west, giving the fort long views up and downriver in both directions. It was the third fort constructed on the site since the 18th century, but its location on marshy ground led to major problems with subsidence. The fort was equipped for a time with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns which were intended to support two other nearby Thamesside forts. However, the extent of the subsidence meant that it became unsafe for the guns to be fired and the fort was disarmed by the early 20th century.

Shornemead Fort was in use from its completion in 1870 to its abandonment in the 1950s. Much of it was demolished by the Army Demolition School of the Royal Engineers in the 1960s. The barracks and administrative buildings have been completely destroyed and only the front of the casemates survives along with the magazines underneath, though the latter are now flooded and inaccessible. The surviving fragments of the fort and the area around it are part of a nature reserve and can be visited by the public.

==Early development==

The Thames was guarded by a number of forts built around Gravesend and Tilbury in the 16th and 17th centuries but these were inadequate against the threat of the new generation of artillery that had emerged by the end of the 18th century. An artillery battery was established farther downriver at Shornemead in 1795–96, during the Napoleonic Wars, along with two other batteries at Lower Hope Point on the Kent side and Coalhouse Point on the Essex side. It was a small pentagonal structure with earthen ramparts, within which four 24-pdr. guns were mounted in open emplacements, with a range of . The first Shornemead Fort was provided with a barracks, magazine and defensible gorges and was planted with walnut trees nearby to supplement the garrison&#x27;s food supply and provide wood for the stocks of their muskets.

After the defeat of Napoleon the battery was abandoned. It was rebuilt in the mid-1840s, along with Coalhouse Fort. The second Shornemead Fort was constructed between 1848–52 to a polygonal plan inspired by the ideas of the French military engineer Montalembert, in a novel move away from the bastioned trace design used in other British forts of the time. It was an open battery like the first fort, but with much more numerous and powerful artillery – thirteen 32-pdr. guns on traversing carriages, each with a range of . The ramparts occupied three sides of the fort, facing the river. A barracks was constructed on the remaining two (landward) sides, along with bomb-proof magazines and defensive caponiers to flank the fort&#x27;s ditch. The marshy ground caused major problems and the fort was not completed until 1853. Subsidence badly cracked the cookhouse and barracks, and one of the caponiers split away from the rest of the structure.

By the late 1850s, Britain and France were locked in an arms race. A new generation of increasingly accurate and powerful guns had been developed (of the Rifled Muzzle Loader (RML) and Rifled Breech Loader (RBL) types), mounted on fast-moving, manoeuvrable steam-powered ironclad warships such as the French &quot;La Gloire&quot; and the British . Britain&#x27;s coastal defences had not been substantially upgraded since the Napoleonic Wars and the country&#x27;s existing fortifications were largely obsolete. The Thames possessed several naval installations of great importance, including the victualling yards at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet. It was not possible for large warships to reach central London, as the river was not yet deep enough to take ships of more than 400 tons above Deptford. As the American Civil War soon showed, it was quite possible for the warships of the day to run past forts and attack up coastal rivers.

The government&#x27;s response was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. It recommended that a triangle of forts should be established on the lower Thames, east of Gravesend. This would involve replacing the old Coalhouse Fort on the Essex shore with a new fortification, similarly replacing the existing Shornemead Fort and building a wholly new fort at Cliffe. The location of the forts would enable interlocking arcs of fire from their guns. It was originally intended that the forts would form part of a line of defences running all the way to Chatham, but the rest of this chain was never built. Shornemead was regarded as being in a particularly strategic location as it commanded river bends at which ships would have to slow down, making them more vulnerable.

==Construction==
The third and final iteration of Shornemead Fort was constructed between 1861 and 1870 at an estimated cost of £211,063. The fort and its counterparts at Coalhouse Point and Cliffe were designed, except for their ironwork, by Captain Siborne of the Royal Engineers. The iron and steel shields of their casemates were developed by Captain English and Lieutenant English of the Royal Engineers. It was substantially larger than its predecessor, replacing the vulnerable open emplacements with immensely strong casemates capable of resisting direct artillery fire. They were over thick, with layers of steel and wood faced with granite. The original plans envisaged the roof of the fort being used to emplace fourteen guns behind shields and a masonry parapet. Two pivot guns and twenty other guns would be housed at ground level within casemates. However, subsidence caused by the marshy ground was again a problem for the fort builders. The design could not be realised in its original form and it underwent substantial changes in 1867, part-way through construction.

In the final design, the plan to put guns on the fort&#x27;s roof were abandoned. Instead, eleven casemates were placed in an arc on one side of the D-shaped fort, pointing downriver towards Lower Hope Point. An open battery stood at the west end of the casemates, mounting three guns that pointed upriver toward Gravesend and Tilbury. This was to enable artillery support for the older forts at those two towns, which were now relegated to the second line of defence. A single-storey defensible barracks built from Kentish Ragstone stood at the rear of the fort. It was equipped with loopholes so that the garrison could fight off an attack from the landward side. Three caponiers protected the perimeter and an open parade ground occupied the centre of the fort. A ditch originally lay in front of the casemates and open battery but was filled in during the 1880s. The magazines underneath the casemates and open battery consisted of a line of storerooms for shells and cartridges, linked by a lighting passage at the rear and an ammunition passage at the front.

==Operational history==

Shornemead Fort was initially equipped with eleven 11-inch rifled muzzle loaders (RMLs) in casemates, with a range of , plus another three 9-inch RMLs in the west-facing open battery. They were mounted on special garrison carriages to absorb their recoil and could be trained using traverse rails to alter their direction of fire. In 1895 two 6-pdr. quick-firing (QF) guns were installed on the fort; they were intended to protect a minefield that would be installed in the river in the event of war. Searchlights were also installed in separate emplacements to the west of the fort. Around the same time, a submarine mining establishment was constructed, also located to the west of the fort.

At some point between 1895 and 1907, Shornemead Fort was disarmed. Subsidence had made it structurally unsafe for its emplaced guns to be fired, and it was in any case strategically redundant by that point. It was used for a time by the Thames Militia Division (Submarine Miners), Royal Engineers, as a training facility linked with the nearby submarine mining depot. It was temporarily re-armed in 1913 with two 12-pdr. QF guns in emplacements outside the fort and again in 1941 when it was designated as an emergency battery. Two 5.5-inch naval guns were installed in the same emplacements as the 1913 guns, east of the fort, with concrete gun houses protecting them. An embarkation hard was constructed on the riverside below the fort to support the D-Day operation. Aerial photographs from the time show the battery, fort, associated concrete pillboxes and searchlights surrounded by dense tangles of barbed wire. The fort was reduced to care and maintenance status in November 1943, while the battery was deactivated in 1945 and demolished around 1976.

The barrack accommodation of Shornemead Fort was used for many years by soldiers training on the nearby Milton rifle range. A permanent staff was based at the fort, and the barracks included lecture rooms, staff accommodation and even a swimming pool built to the east of the fort. The fort was abandoned after the end of World War II and was demolished in the 1960s by the Army Demolition School of the Royal Engineers as part of a training exercise. The staff accommodation and remains of the mining establishment were demolished in the 1970s.

==Current status==

The fort is now in a mostly destroyed condition with only the front of the casemates standing above ground. Some tidying-up has been performed, but the ruins are vulnerable to vandalism. Nothing remains of the barracks and administrative buildings of the fort. The magazines still exist below ground; they are flooded and were sealed off in 2008. The site can be visited by the public, as it is now part of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds&#x27; Shorne Marshes Nature Reserve. It is linked to the Lower Higham Road by a concrete road originally built by the military to provide access, and is passed by the Saxon Shore Way long-distance footpath.

<text>Coalhouse Fort is an artillery fort in the eastern English county of Essex. It was built in the 1860s to guard the lower Thames from seaborne attack. It stands at Coalhouse Point on the north bank of the river, at a location near East Tilbury which was vulnerable to raiders and invaders. It was the last in a series of fortifications dating back to the 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid-19th century fort built on the same site. Constructed during a period of tension with France, its location on marshy ground caused problems from the start and led to a lengthy construction process. The fort was equipped with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities of the time, including shell-proof casemates protected by granite facing and cast-iron shields. Its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was practically obsolete for its original purpose within a few years of its completion.

The fort&#x27;s armament was revised several times during its 70 years of military use, as its role evolved in the river&#x27;s defensive system. It was initially a front-line fortification, supported by Shornemead Fort and Cliffe Fort located to the south and east respectively on the Kent shore. Over time, as batteries and forts further downriver became the front line of the Thames defences, Coalhouse Fort was stripped of its main weapons and it was altered to support smaller quick-firing guns intended to be used against fast-moving surface and aerial targets. Its last military use was as a training facility for a few years after the Second World War.

Decommissioned in 1949, the fort was used as a storehouse for a shoe factory before it was purchased by the local council. The surrounding land was developed into a public park, but the fort itself fell into dereliction despite its historical and architectural significance. From 1985 it was leased to a voluntary preservation group, the Coalhouse Fort Project, which had been working to restore the fort and use it for heritage and educational purposes. Funding for its restoration was provided in part by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Warner Bros. film studio, which used the fort as a location for the opening scenes of the 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. The group closed in 2020.

==Development==
===Early defences===

East Tilbury, which stands at the western end of the section of the Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was fortified long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers. Settlements on both sides of the Thames were raided by the French in 1379 during the second phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent&#x27;s Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury.

Appeals from the local people led to the Crown agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen rampart and towers to protect the settlement. The site of these early defences is not known but might have been near where St Catherine&#x27;s Church now stands. A ditch of unknown date in that vicinity may represent a fragment of the medieval defences.

===Henrician defences===

Henry VIII ordered the construction of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.

The East Tilbury Blockhouse was built partly with stone taken from St Margaret&#x27;s Chapel in Tilbury, which was dissolved in 1536. Its form is not known but it probably consisted of a brick and stone structure, perhaps in a D-shape, with a rampart and ditch to enclose its landward side. It was recorded as having fifteen iron and brass cannon of various calibres in 1540; these had been increased to 27 by 1539–40. It had a small permanent garrison, consisting of a commander and his deputy, a porter, two soldiers and four gunners. The blockhouse may have been altered in 1545 but in 1553 it was disarmed. Although the corresponding blockhouse at Gravesend continued in use and that at Tilbury was eventually incorporated into Tilbury Fort between 1670 and 1683, the one at East Tilbury seems to have been abandoned before the end of the 16th century. By 1735 it had been inundated by the river and was in ruins. Its site by the shoreline has since been eroded away by tidal action, though it is possible that remains from the blockhouse may still survive under the river mud.

===Coalhouse Battery===

The June 1687 Raid on the Medway by the Dutch fleet during the Second Anglo-Dutch War exposed the weaknesses of the Thames defences. It took another hundred years for the defences on Gravesend Reach to be improved, in the form of new works at Gravesend and Tilbury built in the 1780s, but even then the potential of forward defence – to prevent enemies accessing the lower Thames – continued to be neglected. It was not until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars that the need for effective forward defence was addressed. Lieutenant Colonel Hartcup of the Royal Engineers carried out a survey of the Thames in 1794 in which he recommended building a triangle of artillery batteries to guard the entrance to Gravesend Reach and the next reach of the river, Lower Hope Reach. Two of the batteries would be located on the south bank at Shornemead, about north-west of Higham; at Lower Hope Point, about north-west of Cliffe; and on the north bank at East Tilbury, about north of the old Henrician blockhouse. The batteries would have a maximum range of about and their arcs of fire would overlap, enabling them to support each other.

The new battery was constructed during 1799 on marshy ground a short distance south-east of St Catherine&#x27;s Church. It took its name from the nearby Coalhouse Point, which was named for a coal wharf that once existed there to serve East Tilbury. The soft soil caused many problems but the work was completed by July of that year. It was equipped with four 24-pounder (pdr.) cannon mounted on traversing carriages, which enabled the gunners to track targets much more easily than had been the case with traditional garrison carriages. The battery faced the river with a semi-circular earthen rampart on which the guns were mounted. A walled-off area to the rear enclosed a barracks, magazine and shot kiln (for heating shot to set wooden ships on fire). The whole structure was surrounded by a polygonal water-filled ditch. It was modified in 1810 to raise the height of the rampart and to add a small expense magazine where ammunition was stored for immediate use. The French did not test the Thames defences, despite an invasion scare in 1804, and the battery was abandoned along with those at Lower Hope Point and Shornemead following Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat in 1815.

===First Coalhouse Fort===

Renewed tension between Britain and France in the 1840s led to a modernisation of some of Britain&#x27;s coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In the case of the Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.

The new fort was built as an extension to the north-west of the existing battery, and thus took an irregular plan. The rampart was extended to accommodate more guns – a total of seventeen 32-pdrs. – and a much enlarged interior replaced the old barracks and magazine. Caponiers at the east side and firing positions on the other sides facilitated musketry defence against land-based assailants. The fort was surrounded by a wide water-filled ditch. A bridge on the west (landward) side provided the only access route.

===Second Coalhouse Fort===

By the late 1850s, Britain and France were locked in an arms race. A new generation of increasingly accurate and powerful guns had been developed (of the rifled muzzle loader (RML) and rifled breech loader (RBL) types), mounted on fast-moving, manoeuvrable steam-powered ironclad warships such as the French &quot;La Gloire&quot; and the British . Such vessels posed a serious threat to the important naval installations on the Thames, including the victualling yards at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet. It was not possible for large warships to reach central London, as the river was not yet deep enough to take ships of more than 400 tons above Deptford. (Capital dredging later enabled much larger ships to reach as far as the Pool of London.) As the American Civil War was soon to show, it was quite possible for the warships of the day to run past forts and attack up coastal rivers.

The new weapons meant that the existing coastal and riverine forts were rendered largely obsolete. The American Civil War was soon to demonstrate that traditional brick and masonry forts could be reduced to rubble by rifled guns. The government&#x27;s response was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. The Royal Commission recommended that a triangle of forts should be established on the lower Thames, east of Gravesend. This would involve replacing the existing Coalhouse Fort on the Essex shore with a new fortification, similarly replacing the existing Shornemead Fort and building the wholly new Cliffe Fort opposite Coalhouse Point, which would replace the abandoned 18th-century battery at Lower Hope Point. The locations of the forts would enable interlocking arcs of fire from their guns. A boom defence and a minefield would be installed off Coalhouse Point in wartime to further boost the strength of the defences.

The design of the new fort was similar to that of the other Royal Commission forts on the Thames, with an arc of granite-faced casemates, reinforced by iron shields. These, it was believed, would be virtually invulnerable to enemy fire. It was originally envisaged that the fort would have two tiers (in a design similar to that of Garrison Point Fort at Sheerness) mounting around 56 guns; 28 in casemates and the rest in barbettes on the fort&#x27;s roof. Construction began on this basis in July 1861 but as the work progressed the design was changed, leaving the fort with only a single tier of casemates. Like its predecessors, its construction was seriously affected by the poor ground conditions and was disrupted by shifting and cracking foundations. Colonel Charles George Gordon, who was later to die in the siege of Khartoum, supervised its final phases of construction. The fort cost a total of £130,000 to build.

==Operational history==

===19th century===

It was originally intended that Coalhouse Fort would be armed with 68-pdr. smooth-bore guns, but these had become obsolete by the time it was completed in 1874. More powerful armour-piercing weapons were required, so the casemates were provided with four 12.5-inch and thirteen 11-inch RMLs with a range of about . A further three 9-inch RMLs were emplaced in the open battery. They were mounted on metal traversing platforms that could be elevated and traversed using hand-operated gearing devices. Operating the guns presented significant challenges; the 12.5-inch RMLs weighed up to apiece, used a charge weighing to fire a shell weighing to their maximum range, and broke windows half a mile away when they were fired. The detonations and clouds of choking black smoke generated when firing them presented a serious physical hazard to the gun crews.

The guns were controlled from a Battery Commander&#x27;s Post on the roof, from where commands to the gun detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns&#x27; targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned so that they could be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.

The rapid development of artillery weapons in the late 19th century meant that the casemate style of fortification had become virtually obsolete within a decade of the fort&#x27;s completion. Its original purpose of defending the river against large warships was taken over by a new East Tilbury Battery, constructed in 1891 about to the north-west just outside East Tilbury village. This contained six much more powerful breech-loading (BL) guns on Moncrieff disappearing carriages within concealed emplacements facing east up the river. A similar battery was built at Slough Fort on the Hoo Peninsula a few miles downriver.

At the same time, a new threat had emerged in the shape of the fast and highly manoeuvrable torpedo boat. Large guns were virtually useless against such vessels, so the fort was supplemented with another new battery built in 1893 some to the south where 6-pdr. quick-firing guns were installed. Similar batteries were built on the opposite shore at Shornemead and Cliffe Forts.

===Early 20th century===

By the start of the 20th century the fort&#x27;s casemates had been put out of use as they were too vulnerable to modern artillery. Instead, part of the fort&#x27;s front was covered with a sloping glacis made of earth, blocking the casemates and filling the inner defensive ditch. At least one of the front caponiers was also demolished around this time. Most of the old RMLs were retired and replaced with four Mk. VII six-inch BL guns and four 12-pdr quick-firing (QF) BL guns, with ranges of and respectively, mounted on concrete emplacements on the fort&#x27;s roof. The larger guns were intended to support those at East Tilbury Battery while the smaller ones provided a defence against fast-moving vessels such as destroyers and torpedo boats. Despite their obsolescence, two of the old 12.5-inch RMLs remained at the fort until as late as 1912. They were to be used as &quot;giant blunderbusses&quot; to spray torpedo boats with grapeshot if they got past the other guns.

Coalhouse Fort was manned during the First World War by No. 2 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, which manned the guns; the 2nd Company London Electrical Engineers operated the electric searchlights. A minefield was installed in the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse forts, with mechanically operated mines in the shallower parts of the river and remotely detonated mines in the navigable channel. Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore-based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel. Coalhouse Fort took on the role of an Examination Battery controlling the river traffic in conjunction with the River Examination Service. Incoming vessels were checked by tugs based alongside the old HMS &quot;Champion&quot;, moored in midriver, and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop, the fort was authorised to fire across its bows.

The fort&#x27;s armament was reduced during the war as other forts and batteries took over some of its duties. Two of the six-inch guns were shipped across the river to Cliffe Fort in 1914 and the QF guns on the roof were withdrawn. An anti-aircraft battery was established north-west of the fort for defence against Zeppelins and enemy bombers.

===1920s to 1940s===

Following the end of the war, it was proposed in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery firepower meant that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.

Coalhouse Fort became an &quot;emergency&quot; battery during the anti-invasion preparations of the early Second World War. The existing 6-inch guns were replaced in July 1941 with two 5.5-inch guns which had been removed from HMS &quot;Hood&quot; during a refit in April 1940. These had a range of and were installed in two of the old 6-inch emplacements. A steel shelter was constructed on the fort&#x27;s roof to protect the guns, which were also camouflaged with netting. A brick observation post on the roof provided range-finding, and two remotely controlled searchlights installed on the roof of the north caponier could illuminate the riverside below. The purpose of these installations was to protect against raids by cruisers and torpedo boats and to counter any landings in the Thames.

The fort&#x27;s defences were also enhanced with two light anti-aircraft guns, including a Bofors 40 mm gun installed on the roof in August 1943, while the fort&#x27;s perimeter was surrounded by barbed wire and trenches. Two spigot mortars were installed at the fort&#x27;s rear; their bases can still be seen today. A detached concrete observation tower was built just north of the fort for use as an Extended Defence Officer&#x27;s Post, to control the electrically detonated mines that had been laid in the river. A radar tower manned by naval personnel was also built south of the fort by 1941 to cover the approaches to the minefield, and an anti-aircraft battery was built to the north-west at Bowaters Farm in August 1939. It was frequently used in defence of the eastern approaches to London and was bombed on more than one occasion.

By 1944 the threat of invasion had abated and the fort was handed over to the Home Guard&#x27;s No. 356 Coast Battery detachment. Its complement at this time was a captain, two lieutenants and 103 other ranks. They were supplemented by a detachment of Wrens who operated a degaussing range established at Coalhouse Fort in 1943 under the name of HMS &quot;St Clement&quot;. Outbound ships passed over submerged sensors which detected whether the steel in their hulls had been demagnetised to a sufficient extent to make them undetectable by German magnetic mines. If they were detected, they would be recalled for further degaussing. As one of the Wrens later recalled, they found themselves &quot;surrounded by a wonderful array of young men, soldiers and marines of all ranks – and we were the only girls in sight.&quot;

HMS &quot;St Clement&quot; became a Combined Operations base and evolved into HMS &quot;St Clement I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;. As HMS &quot;St Clement III&quot;, the fort&#x27;s last military designation, it was used after 1946 by the Admiralty for training Sea Cadets and nautical youth groups. It was decommissioned in 1949.

==Architecture==

===Casemates===

Coalhouse Fort is exceptionally well-preserved; it provides one of the finest surviving examples of a mid-Victorian armoured casemate fort. It has twelve casemates arranged in a semi-circle facing south and east towards the river, with an annexed open battery facing south-west. The casemates are faced with massive slabs of granite and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from splinters dislodged by incoming fire.

Although the casemates have been altered over the years, many of their original features survive. None of the guns remain &quot;in situ&quot; but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates were divided into two sections. During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates&#x27; rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope were hung. These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts on either side of the emplacements.

The guns mounted in the open battery were lighter than those in the casemates and were not enclosed but traversed on rails in the open air. A covered section between each emplacement led to an ammunition lift shaft up which the shells and cartridges were raised using lifting gear that still survives.

Improvements to artillery technology necessitated significant changes to the fort&#x27;s structure towards the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort&#x27;s roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra weight on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.

===Magazines, barracks and roof===

The magazines, situated deep under the casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage at the front and a lighting passage behind. Great care was taken to reduce the possibility of an accidental explosion. The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the cartridge stores were covered by wooden battens. The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated from the rest of the magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.

A defensible barracks made of brick, faced in Kentish ragstone on the fort&#x27;s exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is indented to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel shutters. The first floor of the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort&#x27;s interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCOs and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.

An irregularly shaped parade area occupies the middle of the fort, which is divided by a sloping ramp leading up to the casemates. A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands to the right of the ramp. The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.

The roof of the fort, accessed via steps up from the open battery, was altered substantially during the first half of the 20th century to accommodate new guns and other structures. These include emplacements for 5.5-inch and 6-inch guns as well as 12-pdrs, searchlight positions, shelters, an observation post, a fire control building, a machine-gun parapet on the north caponier and a Royal Navy monitoring station.

===External facilities===
The fort was linked to a jetty, Coalhouse Wharf, on the riverside a short distance to the south. A standard gauge railway track led from the fort&#x27;s interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and supplies from the wharf. The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called &quot;Gog&quot; and &quot;Magog&quot;, built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s. The remains of the jetty are still visible, as are sections of the track within the fort&#x27;s entrance.
A two-storey concrete structure just north of the fort was used during the Second World War as an Extended Defence Officer&#x27;s Post to control the minefield outside the fort. It could also serve as a pillbox. A corresponding post stood on the Kent shore. A small concrete structure a further north-east of the fort may have been an electrical power house. The minefield was overlooked by a hexagonal radar tower about south of the fort, consisting of a concrete structure on a metal frame on which the radar array was mounted. This stands atop a brick building in which the power plant, electrical equipment radar screen and personnel accommodation were located. It was only used for a short time between 1941 and 1943 and is now considered structurally unsafe. Situated nearby is the detached battery built in 1893 to mount four 6-pdr. quick-firing guns. It is well-preserved and the emplacements, ready-use lockers and magazines are all still largely intact.

==Current status==
After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased and used as a storage facility by Bata Shoes, which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury. It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground was used as a coal store during a miners&#x27; strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the building itself decayed badly through neglect and vandalism.

Coalhouse Fort and the adjacent artillery defences to the south of the fort were collectively designated as a scheduled monument in 1962, in recognition of their status as &quot;a remarkable group of defensive sites&quot;.

The fort was leased to the Coalhouse Fort Project, a heritage charity operated by volunteers between 1985 and 2020. The project undertook the gradual restoration of the fort and held regular open days. Various items of 20th century military equipment were displayed in the interior of the fort; the casemates housed reconstructions and small military-related museums. The project was highly commended in the British Archaeological Awards and the fort has featured both in the BBC series &quot;Restoration&quot; and in the 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, in which it stood in for a Bhutanese prison in the first five minutes of the film. The British director Christopher Nolan had seen the TV series and decided that he wanted to set the film&#x27;s opening scenes in the fort.

The poor condition of parts of the structure and its state of slow decay led to it be listed in 2008 on the Heritage at Risk Register. English Heritage provided an emergency grant in 2009, supplemented by Thurrock Council and the filming fee from Warner Bros. for &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, to help make £200,000 worth of repairs to the gatehouse. These were completed in 2011. Grants from Veolia Thames and Thurrock Council, via the Heritage Lottery Fund, have funded the construction of a new block outside the fort entrance to house a cafe, toilets and information centre. A four-mile (6.4 km) riverside walk known as the Two Forts Way links Coalhouse Fort with its older counterpart Tilbury Fort; it is described as &quot;a challenging route suitable for able bodied walkers and experienced cyclists.&quot; Funded by the newly restructured Historic England (formerly English Heritage), a survey of the heritage site was completed in early 2017 and repairs to make the fort watertight were expected to begin in late 2017.

In January 2020, the Coalhouse Fort Project was discontinued in recognition of its success in saving and restoring the fort, leaving the site&#x27;s future direction to Thurrock Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund.

<doc id="1036528" wikidata="Q378166" url="?curid=1036528" title="Stankonia">
<text>Stankonia is the fourth studio album by the American hip hop duo Outkast. It was released on October 31, 2000, by LaFace Records and Arista Records. The album was recorded in the duo&#x27;s recently purchased Atlanta recording facility Stankonia Studios, which allowed for fewer time and recording constraints, and featured production work from Earthtone III (a production team consisting of Outkast and Mr. DJ) and longtime collaborators Organized Noize.

For the follow-up to their 1998 album &quot;Aquemini&quot;, the duo worked to create an expansive and experimental musical aesthetic, incorporating a diverse array of styles including funk, rave music, psychedelia, gospel, and rock within a Dirty South-oriented hip hop context. During the recording sessions, André 3000 began moving beyond traditional rapping in favor of a more melodic vocal style, an approach to which Big Boi and several other producers were initially unaccustomed. Lyrically, the duo touched upon a wide range of subject matters, including sexuality, politics, misogyny, African-American culture, parenthood, and introspection. &quot;Stankonia&quot; featured appearances from a variety of local musicians discovered by the group while they were visiting clubs in their native city of Atlanta, Georgia.

&quot;Stankonia&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics upon its release and has since been regarded by many to be one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling over 530,000 copies the first week. It was supported by three singles: &quot;B.O.B&quot;, &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot;, and &quot;So Fresh, So Clean&quot;; &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; became the group&#x27;s first single to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. At the 44th Annual Grammy Awards, Outkast won Best Rap Album for &quot;Stankonia&quot; and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 359 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, 361 in a 2012 revision, and 64 in a 2020 reboot of the list. A re-issue of the album for its 20th anniversary with previously unreleased remixes was released on October 30, 2020.

==Background==
In 1998, OutKast released their third album &quot;Aquemini&quot; to critical acclaim while diversifying and expanding their sound. The album&#x27;s success also attracted national attention to the Southern hip hop scene. Having collaborated on the &quot;Aquemini&quot; track &quot;Skew It on the Bar-B&quot;, the Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon later recalled the duo&#x27;s impact at the time: &quot;Before that, the South just wasn&#x27;t played in New York. But that song was hot, the flows was crazy. The cycle changed. It really opened up the door for Southern rappers.&quot;

In March 1998, OutKast purchased a studio nearby Northside Drive in Atlanta. Formerly owned by the R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown, the studio was the first place the duo had ever recorded vocals together – on a remix of TLC&#x27;s &quot;What About Your Friends&quot; (1992) – and held sentimental value for them. Outkast named the studio &quot;Stankonia&quot;, a word created by André 3000 as a portmanteau of the words &quot;stank&quot; (a slang synonym for &quot;funky&quot;) and &quot;Plutonia&quot; (the title of a poster in his bedroom depicting a futuristic city). As he explained, &quot;Stankonia is this place I imagined where you can open yourself up and be free to express anything&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poet/Playa&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
The recording of &quot;Stankonia&quot; began in spring of 1999 and lasted for about a year. Owning a studio helped the band expand creatively, as the duo did not need to worry about time constraints that would occur with a rented studio. André 3000 observed, &quot;You can sit there and fuck with just a kick and a snare all day long if you want to ... You&#x27;re not working on the clock. Really, you&#x27;re just working on your mind.&quot; Big Boi spent the majority of the recording time in the studio, while André 3000 worked at home, creating beats and experimenting with an acoustic guitar. One song that came from a jam session on the guitar was &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single. André 3000 also created song lyrics by writing words on the walls of his home: &quot;I had planned to paint my house anyway; writing on the walls was just something I would do.&quot; One stray lyric on his wall eventually developed into &quot;Gasoline Dreams&quot;.

Much of the album was formulated during &quot;vibe sessions&quot; in which the group and producers would visit clubs in downtown Atlanta, select performers they saw, and invite them to the studio. They would then &quot;sit around, smoke a few, drink a few&quot;, and create ideas for new songs. However, recording sessions became difficult as André 3000 grew tired of rapping on songs, which made Big Boi and the producers uneasy about how the music would sound. To maintain musical cohesion with Big Boi while continuing to expand his vocal palette, André decided to combine rapping with soul-inspired crooning, which had a major influence on &quot;Stankonia&quot;&#x27;s sound. &quot;Snappin &amp; Trappin&#x27;&quot; features a guest appearance from the then-unknown rapper Killer Mike. The rapper noted that while working with Outkast, he used the opportunity to try to &quot;compete&quot; with the duo to improve his rapping skills. Big Boi was impressed with Killer Mike&#x27;s abilities, noting, &quot;When I first heard him spit, his voice was just so commanding. He&#x27;s a very intelligent guy.&quot;

==Composition==

===Music and style===

While OutKast&#x27;s previous albums were considered to be laid-back, mellow efforts, &quot;Stankonia&quot; contains faster, more high-energy tempos, partially to reflect the &quot;chaotic times&quot; at the end of the 20th century. The group took note of new, harder drugs hitting the hip-hop scene and teenagers using ecstasy, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Big Boi reflected, &quot;Niggas living this life at a fast speed don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on around them. If you live fast, you gonna come out of here real fast, so the music need to show that.&quot; While recording &quot;Stankonia&quot;, the band refrained from listening to hip-hop, &quot;That music was starting to sound real comfortable. There wasn&#x27;t any adventure to it.&quot; Instead, the duo drew influence from musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Little Richard, Prince, and George Clinton, as well as Clinton&#x27;s Parliament-Funkadelic collective. However, the band refrained from producing a throwback sound with the record and instead hoped to utilize these influences in a modern, experimental fashion. André 3000 stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t want this to be the generation that went back to &#x27;70s rock. You gotta take it and do new things with it.&quot;

On &quot;Stankonia&quot;, OutKast experimented with a wide variety of musical genres. According to M. Matos of &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Stankonia&quot; &quot;turned the South&#x27;s predominantly reclined hip-hop sound into something freaky and menacing.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey said their experimentation resulted in &quot;a trippy sort of techno-psychedelic funk&quot;. &quot;B.O.B&quot; features &quot;jittery drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass rhythms&quot; and has been classified as a &quot;stylistic tour de force&quot; combining &quot;Hendrix-ian&quot; guitars, organs, and gospel vocals. On the track, André 3000 and Big Boi employ a &quot;frantic&quot; flow in order to keep pace with the song&#x27;s high-speed tempo, which runs at 155 beats per minute. &quot;Humble Mumble&quot; is a salsa-influenced track that evolves into a club groove, while &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; &quot;marries early Prince with late P-Funk&quot;. The smooth melodies of &quot;I&#x27;ll Call Before I Come&quot; have also been likened to Prince. &quot;Gasoline Dreams&quot; has been classified as a &quot;gritty rock scorcher&quot; comparable to the work of Public Enemy. David Bry of &quot;Vibe&quot; detected a &quot;polished 80&#x27;s pimp strut&quot; in &quot;So Fresh, So Clean&quot; and an &quot;appreciative, fat-ass bounce&quot; in &quot;We Luv Deez Hoes&quot;. The album ends with three psychedelic-influenced tracks, &quot;Toilet Tisha&quot;, &quot;Slum Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Stankonia (Stank Love)&quot;. &quot;Stankonia (Stank Love)&quot; has also been described as an &quot;homage of sorts&quot; to gospel choirs and &#x27;60s doo-wop groups, while also including a slowed down coda reminiscent of chopped and screwed hip hop.

===Lyrics===
According to Miles Marshall Lewis, &quot;Stankonia&quot; is among the most &quot;eclectic&quot; of mainstream progressive rap albums from its time. Paul Lester of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described OutKast&#x27;s lyrical style on the album by saying, &quot;They are, in a way, post-hip-hop, combining PM Dawn&#x27;s kooky confections with the Pharcyde&#x27;s hallucinatory whimsy, Public Enemy&#x27;s hardline politicking with De La Soul&#x27;s cartoon dementia, to fashion something vital and new.&quot; &quot;Gasoline Dreams&quot; assails the &quot;bling-bling&quot; aspirations of contemporary black culture, instead presenting a sobering view of circumstances upending the world in Outkast&#x27;s perspective (&quot;I hear that Mother Nature&#x27;s now on birth control / The coldest pimp be lookin&#x27; for somebody to hold&quot;). &quot;Red Velvet&quot; discusses the materialistic nature of the hip hop scene in particular, while &quot;Humble Mumble&quot; addresses critics who make negative assumptions about hip hop based on preconceived notions; André 3000 raps in the song: &quot;I met a critic / I made her shit her draws / She said she thought hip hop was only guns and alcohol / I said oh hell naw / but yet it&#x27;s that too / You can&#x27;t discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two.&quot;

The album commonly features the words &quot;stank&quot; and &quot;smell&quot; in their blues-rooted definition to mean &quot;low-down, blunt, pungent: a measure of authenticity&quot;. Outkast often incorporates word play into the lyrics, including &quot;Humble Mumble&quot;″s references to the &quot;underground smellroad&quot; and chants of &quot;I stank I can, I stank I can&quot;, an allusion to &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot;. The duo offers encouragement for maturity and facing adversity on the song, beginning with Big Boi&#x27;s verse advising that &quot;everything in life don&#x27;t always happen like it&#x27;s supposed to&quot; while referencing Isaiah 54:17 (&quot;No weapon formed against me prospers&quot;). Meanwhile, André 3000 frames his perspective in the context of progressing African Americans collectively: &quot;The game changes every day, so obsolete is the fist and marches / Speeches only reaches those who already know about it&quot;. Erykah Badu, his ex-girlfriend and friend at the time, concludes &quot;Humble Mumble&quot; with a &quot;soaring metaphysical gospel verse that celebrate[s] the circle of life&quot;, as pop-culture writer Roni Sarig details.

Much of the album discusses the status of women in the South, and contrasts with the misogynistic attitudes common in hip hop music. In the book &quot;Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide&quot;, contributing author Tony Green writes that songs such as &quot;Slum Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Toilet Tisha&quot; &quot;reimagine &#x27;round the way girls, not only as just more than one-dimensional accessories, but as objects of affection with lives and concerns that are worth exploring.&quot; In &quot;Toilet Tisha&quot;, the duo empathizes with suicidal pregnant teenagers. &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; is dedicated to the mother of a mother of an out-of-wedlock child, which André 3000 refers to as &quot;the baby&#x27;s mama&#x27;s mamas&quot;. Inspired by his relationship with Badu, who had given birth to their son Seven, the song serves as an apology to a &quot;baby mama&quot;&#x27;s mother for causing her daughter pain. &quot;I&#x27;ll Call Before I Come&quot; discusses the members putting a woman&#x27;s sexual needs before their own.

==Commercial performance==

&quot;Stankonia&quot; debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, selling 525,844 copies in its first week, behind Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Dynasty: Roc La Familia&quot;; which sold 557,789 copies, and ahead of U2&#x27;s &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, which finished in third place in the U.S. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) within its first week of release. It also reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop albums chart, remaining on the chart for 45 weeks. By February 2002, the album has sold 3.79 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. On November 3, 2003, &quot;Stankonia&quot; was certified quadruple platinum, for shipments of four million copies. In Canada, the album peaked at number four, and was certified double platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on September 23, 2003, for shipments of over 200,000 units. The record also became a top ten hit in Germany, Finland, and Norway, reaching the number six, number eight, and number eight spots on the countries&#x27; official charts, respectively.

The lead single released from &quot;Stankonia&quot;, &quot;B.O.B&quot;, peaked at number 69 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop songs chart. However, the single was banned from many urban Top 40 radio stations due to its title and the subject matter it was assumed to have. On February 3, 2001, &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; topped the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop songs chart, and then on February 17, the single also reached number one on the Hot 100, remaining on the chart for 22 weeks. The song also reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Songs chart, as well as number three on the magazine&#x27;s Radio Songs chart. The third single, &quot;So Fresh, So Clean&quot;, peaked at number 30 on the Hot 100, and stayed on the chart for 20 weeks. The single also peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop songs chart, and number 24 on the Radio songs chart.
==Critical reception==

&quot;Stankonia&quot; received universal acclaim from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 20 reviews. Derek A. Bardowell of &quot;NME&quot; noted that with &quot;Stankonia&quot;, OutKast &quot;hit that rare balance of creative eccentricity and mass appeal&quot; and wrote that the album contains &quot;eternal qualities that will unravel in time on an emotional, intellectual and spiritual level.&quot; Nathan Brackett of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the record &quot;one of the best albums of the year&quot; noting that all of the tracks contain &quot;a down-home generosity and accessibility&quot; and that &quot;even the most street-oriented songs have some sort of commentary in them.&quot; Tony Green of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praised OutKast&#x27;s &quot;feel for sonics and structure&quot; and stated, &quot;they&#x27;ve moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle.&quot; Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, &quot;given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it&#x27;s striking how few weak tracks there are&quot;. Aishah Hight of &quot;PopMatters&quot; stated, &quot;Within &quot;Stankonia&quot;, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice.&quot; &quot;Alternative Press&quot; commented that &quot;experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as &quot;Stankonia&quot;, because they have too much to lose&quot;, but felt that &quot;OutKast don&#x27;t care&quot;, writing that they &quot;coalesced the political and societal challenges of hip hop&#x27;s past into what is one of the genre&#x27;s most artistically unorthodox releases so far.&quot;

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; observed &quot;more bounce-to-the-ounce and less molasses in the jams, more delight and less braggadocio in the raps&quot;, and opined that Big Boi and André 3000&#x27;s &quot;realism and high spirits drive each other higher&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ken Tucker wrote that &quot;&quot;Stankonia&quot; reeks of artful ambition rendered with impeccable skill&quot; and described OutKast as &quot;endlessly good-humored and imaginative even when dealing with the most grim and mind-deadening facets of ghetto life.&quot; Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Soren Baker commented that &quot;Dre and Big Boi again reinvent themselves, this time as Parliament-inspired musicians who specialize on male-female relationships, boasting, and out-there lyrics.&quot; Baker concluded in his review, &quot;With another nearly flawless album, OutKast arguably solidifies their reputation as one of the best hip-hop groups of all time.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that &quot;the record&#x27;s most interesting moments are gorgeous Prince-style soul.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;OutKast&#x27;s music savors the viscous propulsion of funk, with raps and tunes that never ignore the body and its instinctive desires ... Yet OutKast – taking cues from a band it obviously reveres, Parliament-Funkadelic – never forgets that bodies are attached to minds.&quot; &quot;URB&quot; called the album &quot;a complex tome that enmeshes contemporary hip-hop values with a timeless Southern soul, while pushing the envelope damn near off the table.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; called it &quot;hip hop with the power to convert even the most reactionary nonbelievers.&quot;

==Legacy and influence==

&quot;Stankonia&quot; has received many accolades and appeared on many magazines&#x27; &quot;best of&quot; lists; in his book &quot;Dirty South&quot;, author Ben Westhoff noted that the album appeared on &quot;every critical best-list worth mentioning.&quot; At the 2002 Grammy Awards, OutKast won Best Rap Album for &quot;Stankonia&quot; and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot;. Despite OutKast&#x27;s being expected favorites, The Recording Academy instead chose the 2000 soundtrack album &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; for Album of the Year. Before the group&#x27;s nominations, much of the hip hop community felt that rappers were not being awarded enough attention from The Recording Academy. However, the album&#x27;s musical diversity allowed the band to reach a wider audience and was credited for opening the academy up to more hip hop musicians.

In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Stankonia&quot; as one of the 100 best albums of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 16 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Albums of the 2000s. In 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Stankonia&quot; number 13 on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s, and Rhapsody ranked it at number 2 on its &quot;100 Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list. Rhapsody also ranked the album number 6 on its &quot;Hip-Hop&#x27;s Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list. &quot;Vibe&quot; ranked the record at number 23 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums from 1985 to 2005&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;With hummable hits (&#x27;Ms. Jackson&#x27;) and out-there experiments (&#x27;B.O.B.&#x27;), the rap duo gave us all a visa to the funky if fictional land of Stankonia in 2000.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; listed &quot;Stankonia&quot; as one of the best 50 albums of 2001. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2024, Paste Magazine ranked &quot;Stankonia&quot; number 6 on its list of the greatest albums of all-time. In 2015, &quot;Mic&quot; stated that &quot;Stankonia helped hip-hop build its foundation in the mainstream,&quot; adding that in addition to the &quot;irresistibly quotable&quot; hit singles, &quot;the deep cuts are still some of the most rewarding experimental hip-hop around.&quot;

With &quot;Stankonia&quot;, OutKast became the first hip hop act to openly acknowledge rave culture as an influence. During the late 1990s, rappers tended to embrace slow, laid-back beats in their productions. On several tracks on &quot;Stankonia&quot;, the group employed faster, more chaotic tempos to reflect rave culture and the introduction of new drugs such as ecstasy into the hip hop scene. Boston-based DJ Armand Van Helden recalls, &quot;In the nineties, the bpms in hip-hop got slower and the clubs were moody ... it just kind of dragged. I really missed that kind of hands-in-the-air shit.&quot; A remix of &quot;B.O.B&quot; created by Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s Zack de la Rocha received airplay on alternative radio stations, expanding the group&#x27;s fanbase beyond hip hop and urban listeners. Despite containing anti-war sentiments, &quot;B.O.B&quot; became popular amongst American troops deployed in Afghanistan. While working on her acclaimed album &quot;The ArchAndroid&quot; (2010), American R&amp;B singer Janelle Monáe cited &quot;Stankonia&quot;&#x27;s experimental nature as an influence. Rapper Pill also acknowledged &quot;Stankonia&quot;, and particularly the production of Organized Noize, as an inspiration: &quot;The sounds, the instrumentation of the samples, the different horns—everything about the tracks were great to me.&quot;

<doc id="1036546" wikidata="Q1501717" url="?curid=1036546" title="HIV trial in Libya">
<text>The HIV trial in Libya (or Bulgarian nurses affair) concerns the trials, appeals and eventual release of six foreign medical workers charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, causing an epidemic at El-Fatih Children&#x27;s Hospital in Benghazi, Libya. About 56 of the infected children had died by August 2007. The total number of victims rose to 131 in 2022.

The defendants, arrested in 1999, were five Bulgarian nurses (often termed &quot;medics&quot;) and a Palestinian medical intern. They were first sentenced to death, then had their case remanded to Libya&#x27;s highest court, and were sentenced to death again, a penalty which was upheld by Libya&#x27;s highest court in early July 2007. The six then had their sentences commuted to life in prison by a Libyan government panel. They were released following a deal reached with European Union representatives on humanitarian issues; the EU did not condone the guilty verdict in Libya against the six. On 24 July 2007, the five medics and the doctor were extradited to Bulgaria, where their sentences were commuted by the Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and they were freed. Furthermore, a controversy has arisen concerning the terms of release, which allegedly include an arms trade as well as a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement signed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in July 2007. Both the French and Bulgarian presidents have denied that the two deals were related to the liberation of the six, although this has been alleged by a variety of sources, including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

The epidemic at El-Fatih and the subsequent trials were highly politicized and controversial. The medics say that they were forced to confess under torture and that they are innocent. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi later confirmed that Libyan investigators tortured the medics with electric shocks and threatened to target their families in order to extract the confessions, and confirmed that some of the children had been infected with HIV before the medics arrived in Libya. He said that the guilty verdict of the Libyan courts had been based on &quot;conflicting reports&quot; and said, &quot;There is negligence, there is a disaster that took place, there is a tragedy, but it was not deliberate.&quot;

Some of the world&#x27;s foremost HIV experts had written to courts and the Libyan government on the medics&#x27; behalf, blaming the epidemic on poor hygiene practices in the hospital. The epidemic is the largest documented outbreak of HIV within a hospital in history, and it was the first time HIV/AIDS became a public issue in Libya. Virologists Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi, supported the medics&#x27; case, and reaction to their convictions was swift, with a number of appeals from scientific and human rights organizations, and various official condemnations of the verdict along with diplomatic initiatives.

Three of the Bulgarian medics published autobiographical books regarding the trial: &quot;Eight and a Half Years Hostage of Gaddafi&quot; by Kristiyana Vulcheva, &quot;In Gaddafi&#x27;s Cage&quot; by Snezhana Dimitrova and &quot;Notes from Hell&quot; by Valya Cherveniashka and Nikolay Yordanov.

==El-Fatih epidemic in Libya and accusations==
The El-Fatih epidemic is the largest documented incident of nosocomial (hospital-induced) infection of HIV in history. The Libyan public was enraged and many foreign medical workers were arrested; six were eventually charged. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi initially blamed the CIA or Mossad for plotting to carry out a deadly experiment on the Libyan children.

The crisis first came to light in November 1998 when Libyan &quot;La&quot; magazine (issue 78) published an exposé about AIDS at the hospital. In December, the Association of Libyan Writers reported over 60 cases of AIDS so far that year in Libya. &quot;La&quot; interviewed Sulaiman al-Ghemari, Libyan Minister for Health, who told them that most of the cases concerned children. Parents believed their children were infected through blood transfusions in Benghazi&#x27;s main children&#x27;s hospital.
Although &quot;La&quot; magazine was shut down, it was eventually revealed that over 400 children had been infected. Libya requested and received an emergency WHO team, which was sent in December and stayed through January 1999. The WHO team issued a classified report on the situation.

In February 1999, the Bulgarian embassy announced that 23 Bulgarian specialists had been &quot;kidnapped.&quot; A week later they were informed by Libyan authorities that &quot;precautionary measures&quot; had been taken against Bulgarian doctors and nurses working at the Benghazi Children’s Hospital. Most of the nurses were recruited by Bulgarian state-owned company Expomed to work at the Libyan hospital, where pay was considerably higher than they could receive at home, beginning work in February 1998. On 7 March 1999, six members of the group subjected to &quot;precautionary measures&quot; were formally arrested on a warrant in connection with the case of infecting children in Benghazi with HIV. The group consisted of Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh, a Palestinian intern, and Bulgarian nurses Kristiyana Valtcheva, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo, Valya Chervenyashka and Snezhana Dimitrova. They later became widely known as &quot;the Benghazi Six&quot;.

==Libyan HIV victims==
Well over 400 children were infected with HIV at the El-Fatih Children&#x27;s Hospital. Some were receiving treatment in Europe. The death toll went up to 50. Parents and relatives of the children protested, and demanded that death penalties be carried out against those responsible. Libyan prime minister Shukri Ghanem insisted that the outcome of the trial was entirely a judicial matter. In a statement broadcast on Al Jazeera, Ghanem said that all efforts should now be focused on the infected children, &quot;who are subject to a death sentence each day.&quot; The families of the infected children also demanded compensation for the actions taken by the convicted medics; figures of up to $10 million per family were mentioned. In July 2007, Libya announced a settlement had been reached, with $400 million going to the 426 victims&#x27; families in exchange for conversion of the nurses&#x27; sentences from death to life in prison.

==Defendants==
Initially, 23 foreign medical personnel, mostly Bulgarian, were arrested; 17 were subsequently released and returned to Bulgaria. Additionally, 11 Libyan nationals were arrested and charged with the alleged crimes. Doctor Zdravko Georgiev went to Libya to see his wife (Valtcheva) and was subsequently detained and tried on the charge of illegally transacting in foreign currency. Several Libyans were also arrested and tried on non-capital offences: Abdul Azis Husein Mohammed Shembesh, Abdul Menam Ahmed Mohammed al-Sherif, Idris Maatuk Mohammed al-Amari, Salim Ibrahim Suleyman Abe Garara, Mansur al-Mansur Saleh al-Mauhub, Nureddin Abdulhamid Halil Dagman and Saad Musa Suleyman al-Amruni.

===Ashraf Ahmed al-Hadzhudzh===
Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh was defendant number one in the case. In the prosecution&#x27;s view he was a man in a deadly criminal ring of female nurses dedicated to a plot involving agents of foreign governments; large sums of money; illegal, adulterous sex; and illegal alcohol. He was convicted of murdering 426 Libyan children in carrying out the plot, with the intention of destabilizing the country. He was an intern who started working at the hospital two months before news of the epidemic broke out. His family fled Libya to the Netherlands because, according to them, they had been portrayed by the Libyan media as &quot;killers of innocent children&quot;. Ashraf&#x27;s cousin in the Palestinian Territories As&#x27;ad El-Hajouj told the Turkish Daily News that Ashraf had lost an eye and that one of his hands had been paralyzed due to torture endured in prison. Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh was granted Bulgarian citizenship on 19 June 2007.

===Kristiyana Vulcheva===
Kristiyana Vulcheva, wife of Zdravko Georgiev, was not recruited by Expomed. She was charged along with the others, but was ultimately found not guilty of all charges after initially having been convicted of currency violations. Purported by the prosecution to be the ringleader of the plot, it was claimed that she spoke Arabic and had a luxurious lifestyle. The other four testified that they had never seen Vulcheva before their blindfolds were taken off after their kidnapping by Libyan security, when they were first brought to the police compound in February 1999. Vulcheva was also the only one charged and convicted of illegally distilling alcohol. The defense pointed out that no device used to do this was produced at trial. She admitted in court to having seen Ashraf at the Benghazi Children&#x27;s Hospital. Unlike Ashraf, she never confessed to having sexual relations with him, which is required for a conviction for the crime of adultery under Libyan law. She retracted her confession that vials were given to her by a British citizen which were used to infect the children, denying knowing any such person as &quot;John the Englishman&quot; or having been paid &quot;large sums of money&quot; to infect the children.
After the re-imposition of the death sentence in 2006 it was announced that Vulcheva would be seeking to have Vladimir Sheitanov represent her again. Plamen Yalnuzov had replaced him as representative for the Bulgarians in 2002.

After the verdict her mother made a public plea: &quot;We are sending our plea to the British government and the victims of Lockerbie. We are well aware the issue is painful to all, but in the name of the most humane of the professions we ask them to be merciful and let Megrahi go.&quot;, referring to Abdelbaset al-Megrahi who was serving a life sentence in Scotland for the Lockerbie bombing.

Gaddafi has repeatedly compared the two cases. After the 2006 verdict he said, &quot;Organisations like the Arab League, the non-aligned movement and the Islamic Conference said al-Megrahi was a political prisoner and international observers said elements of foreign intelligence were present at the trial... Nobody asked for his release.&quot;

===Nasya Nenova===
Nasya Nenova attempted suicide. She testified that she confessed and attempted suicide because she was afraid she would be tortured again. She was interrogated alongside Ashraf and told the court they were beaten and that there was no interpreter. She did not confess to having illegal sexual relations with him. She, along with Vulcheva, are the only nurses who admitted knowing Ashraf by sight beforehand, but she said she had never spoken with him. She denied having attempted suicide out of guilt for what she had done. In court she stated that &quot;I am not guilty on any of the counts. My conscience is clear.&quot; and &quot;We had protection from no one, we had no doctor. We were alone there with those men who did everything they wanted to do&quot;. She said she attempted to retract her confession on 17 July 1999, but that a Colonel Juma came and threatened to renew the torture if she persisted.

She is seeking to reappoint Vladimir Sheitanov as a replacement for defence attorneys Yalnyzov and Byzanti after the 2006 death sentence.

===Valya Chervenyashka===

She is from Byala Slatina. She was recruited by Expomed company. Her husband, Emil Uzunov, in a 2003 interview with Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) said that the defense lawyer Bizanti was one of the torturers who beat the six medics during the initial interrogations. Chervenyashka had to correct the story. &quot;I suppose my husband was too nervous and over-reacted,&quot; she said.

Her daughter Antoaneta Uzunova has commented on the case. &quot;It&#x27;s been terrible...The charges were absurd then, they remain absurd now,&quot; she said in 2005. &quot;When I heard them being described as CIA agents...I knew what would happen,&quot; said Uzunova, 28. &quot;Then we found out our loved ones had been tortured in a most cruel way. It&#x27;s a nightmare.&quot;

At another time, she said &quot;Nurses from little towns in Bulgaria acting as agents of Mossad? It all sounds funny and absurd until you realize your mother could die for it.&quot;

She is seeking to reappoint Vladimir Sheitanov as a replacement for defense attorneys Yalnyzov and Byzanti after the 2006 death sentence.

In 2009, Cherveniashka co-wrote with the Bulgarian screenwriter Nikolay Yordanov а biographical book about her years in Libya. The book, titled &quot;Notes from Hell&quot;, was published in Bulgaria on 20 November 2009 and in South Africa in February 2010. It was published again as e-book in 2014 in Bulgarian and English and then in French as &quot;Notes De L’enfer: Une historie vraie&quot; in 2007. In November 2018, the English edition was recorded as audiobook, recorded by British actress Nano Nagle.

===Snezhana Dimitrova===
Dimitrova did not arrive at the hospital until 10 August 1998. She was recruited by Expomed. She is the only one of the condemned to have been picked up for questioning in the roundup of medical workers on 14 December 1998. She was held for two days, and then rearrested with the others on 10 February 1999.

In a handwritten 2003 declaration to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, Snezhana Dimitrova, described torture that had included electric shocks and beatings.

&quot;They tied my hands behind my back,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Then they hung me from a door. It feels like they are stretching you from all sides. My torso was twisted and my shoulders were dislocated from their joints from time to time. The pain cannot be described. The translator was shouting, &#x27;Confess or you will die here.&quot;&#x27;

===Valentina Siropulo===
&quot;I confessed during torture with electricity. They put small wires on my toes and on my thumbs. Sometimes they put one on my thumb and another on my tongue, neck or ear. It had a hand crank to make it go. They had two kinds of machines, one with a crank and one with buttons.&quot;

===Zdravko Georgiev===
Zdravko Georgiev, the husband of Kristiana Vulcheva, came to Libya after his wife was arrested. He was charged along with the others but ultimately was found not guilty of all charges after having been once convicted of currency violations.

==Scientific studies and reports==

===The WHO Report of P.N. Shrestha (1999)===
The World Health Organization (WHO) report (1999) describes the visit performed by the WHO team (P.N. Shrestha, A. Eleftherious and V. Giacomet) to Tripoli, Sirte and Benghazi 28 December 1998 to 11 January 1999, while the Bulgarians were still on staff.

===Montagnier/Colizzi===
There have been several reports done on the HIV outbreak. The most important of these, the Final Report of Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi, was commissioned by the Libyan Jamahiriya, and arranged through UNESCO. Montagnier and Colizzi had access to all the files of the infected subjects available at the Hospital as well as samples from European hospitals that had taken some of the sick children, as well as the samples at El-Fatih.

Their report concluded that the infection at the hospital resulted from poor hygiene and reuse of syringes, and that the infections began before the arrival of the nurses and doctor in 1998. Through hospital records and the DNA sequences of the virus, they traced it to patient n.356 who was admitted 28 times between 1994–97 in Ward B, ISO and Ward A, and theorized that this patient was the probable source of the infection. The first cross-contamination occurred during that patient&#x27;s 1997 admission. The report concludes that the admission records of a total of 21 of the children &quot;definitively prove that the HIV infection in the Al-Fatih Hospital was already active in 1997&quot; and that &quot;Ward B was already heavily contaminated in November 1997.&quot;

Montagnier and Colizzi both testified in person at the trial of record for the defense, and the report was submitted in evidence.

===Final report of Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi===
Luc Montagnier (Paris) and Vittorio Colizzi (Rome) were appointed as international scientific consultants by the Secretary of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.

===Libyan report===
The prosecution advanced a contrary report drawn up by a Libyan expert panel. The scientific community became politically embroiled in events when the criminal court in Benghazi rejected Montagnier/Colizzi in favor of the conclusions of the Libyan experts. After the conviction, Colizzi said the scientific evidence being used against them &quot;is so irrational it&#x27;s unbelievable&quot; and the verdict read &quot;like a bad spy film.&quot;

===Genetic analysis first published in &quot;Nature&quot;===
On 6 December 2006, the science journal &quot;Nature&quot; published a new study which examined the mutation history of the HIV found in blood samples from some of the children, and concluded that a number of those children had been infected well before the six defendants arrived in Libya. In addition, a common ancestor of the strains that infected the children was already present in Libya. The study was based on statistical models of the rate of evolution in HIV derived from previous outbreaks. The publication was reported in newspapers world-wide and sparked an editorial campaign by &quot;Nature&quot; calling for the acquittal of the defendants.

The authors of the study agreed to make fully available all the data they had used so that independent confirmations could be made.

===&quot;Libyan Journal of Medicine&quot;: How Do We Find the Truth?===
Omar Bagasra and his group discussed in detail the previous published reports and asked for examination of the CD4+ T lymphocytes of the infected children to exclude the possibility of their intentional infection with HIV. Their hypothesis is that the children were infected as part of an AIDS vaccine trial.

===Nobel Laureates===
114 Nobel Laureates in the sciences co-signed an open letter to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi calling for a fair trial.

==Torture==
All of the defendants said they had been tortured. This was later confirmed by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the leader of Libya. He said that the confessions were extracted through torture with electric shocks and threats targeted at the medics&#x27; families, and confirmed that some of the children had been infected with HIV before the medics arrived in Libya. He said that the guilty verdict of the Libyan courts had been based on &quot;conflicting reports&quot;, and said that
:&quot;There is negligence, there is a disaster that took place, there is a tragedy, but it was not deliberate.&quot;

Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh has reportedly lost an eye, and one of his hands has been paralyzed. Snezhana Dimitrova declared that her hands were tied behind her back and she was hung from a door dislocating her shoulders, and that she was told to &quot;confess or you will die here.&quot; Nasya Nenova testified that &quot;We were alone there with those men who did everything they wanted to do.&quot; In May 2005 Human Rights Watch interviewed them in Jadida prison.

In her book, Valya Cherveniashka describes the torture sessions in detail. In the chapter &quot;The Red Carpet&quot; she describes first day of interrogation:

In another chapter, &quot;The Hell in Me&quot;, there are tens of examples of torture, including dogs, hanging, beating, humiliating and many more.

Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh, the Palestinian intern, told Human Rights Watch &quot;We had barbaric, sadistic torture for a crime we didn’t do...They used electric shocks, drugs, beatings, police dogs, sleep prevention...The confession was like multiple choice, and when I gave a wrong answer they shocked me.&quot;

Valentina Siropulo told Human Rights Watch &quot;I confessed during torture with electricity. They put small wires on my toes and on my thumbs. Sometimes they put one on my thumb and another on either my tongue, neck or ear.&quot;

Kristiana Valcheva said interrogators used a small machine with cables and a handle that produced electricity, saying that &quot;During the shocks and torture they asked me where the AIDS came from and what is your role...&quot; She said that Libyan interrogators subjected her to electric shocks on her breasts and genitals. &quot;My confession was all in Arabic without translation, [...] We were ready to sign anything just to stop the torture.&quot;

Lawyers for the accused medical personnel have asked for 5 million Libyan dinars (approx. €3.1million/US$3.7 mullion as of 2005) as compensation. Much of the evidence is based on medical reports prepared by authorities from Bulgaria relating to marks and scars on the defendants. All of the accused Libyans deny the charges, and none of them were jailed. After several procedural delays, their trial began in late May 2005. On 7 June 2005, the 10 defendants were acquitted.

The prisoners were sued by several Libyan police officers for slandering them with the allegations of torture. However, on 27 May 2007, the prisoners were acquitted of these charges and the plaintiffs ordered to pay the legal fees.

==Trials==
The first case against the medics was brought in the People’s Court (Mahkamat al-Sha`b), a special court for crimes against the state. The trial began on 7 February 2000. The charges were: intentionally &quot;murdering with a lethal substance (Article 371 of the Penal Code), randomly killing with the aim of attacking the security of the State (Article 202), and causing an epidemic through spreading harmful virus, leading to the death of persons (Article 305).&quot; In addition, the Bulgarians were accused of acting contrary to Libyan customs and traditions, by engaging in non-marital sexual relations and drinking alcohol in public places, distilling alcohol and illegally transacting in foreign currency.

In April 2001 Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi made a speech at the African summit on HIV/AIDS. He told the conference that the world AIDS epidemic started when &quot;CIA laboratories lost control over the virus which they were testing on black Haitian prisoners.&quot; He called the HIV crisis in Benghazi &quot;an odious crime&quot; and questioned who was behind it. &quot;Some said it was the CIA. Others said it was the Mossad Israeli intelligence. They carried out an experiment on these children.&quot; He went on to say that the trial would be &quot;an international trial, like the Lockerbie trial.&quot;

===First trial===
The defendants all pled not guilty. The prosecution submitted the defendant&#x27;s confessions in evidence, but the defendants all repudiated their confessions. They gave interviews and testified at trial that they were forced to confess by the use of torture. This led to charges being filed against 10 Libyan security personnel, some of whom later claimed they had also been tortured, tortured to confess that they had tortured the medics. The guards were eventually acquitted in subsequent trials.

The prosecution described a plot to disrupt Libya by foreign secret services. &quot;To those services, child killing is nothing new. In this way they want to prevent Libya from playing an important role in the Arab World and to disturb calm in the country. The killing of the children by that virus is a means by which those secret services achieve their ends.&quot; In calling for the death penalty the prosecutor said: &quot;These people have no moral human feelings once they have killed those children. They have sold themselves to the devil, even though the Jamahiriya has given them the right to work and live without let or hindrance.&quot; He described the epidemic as a &quot;national catastrophe.&quot;

The defendants denied being part of a conspiracy. Nenova, Chervenyashka, Siropoulo and Dimitrova testified that they did not know Vulcheva until 24 hours after what they called their &quot;kidnapping&quot; from Benghazi, and, according to Nenova, only after their blindfolds were taken off. Vulcheva denied knowing &quot;John the Englishman&quot; or &quot;Adel the Egyptian&quot;. They all denied that they had been paid &quot;large sums of money&quot; to infect the children. Nenova and Vulcheva admitted that they had seen Ashraf at the Benghazi Children&#x27;s Hospital, but testified that they did not communicate with him and did not perform any tasks assigned by him.

The defense lawyers argued that physical evidence on all the charges was lacking, including, the blood bottles alleged to contain contaminated plasma, the device alleged to have been used by Kristiyana Vulcheva to distil alcohol, the syringes which were alleged to have been used to commit the crime, and the photos alleged to show sexual relationships between the defendants. Lawyer Sheitanov, argued that the medics had neither the time nor the conditions to carry out a conspiracy to commit the crime, since Nenova, Siropoulo and Chervenyashka started work at the children&#x27;s hospital on 17 February 1998, Dimitrova on 10 August and Ashraf on 1 August 1998.

A year after the trial began, the People&#x27;s Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction in the matter.&quot;The People&#x27;s Court has the jurisdiction to pronounce itself on state security-related cases and believes itself incompetent on this matter, the spreading of HIV which caused the death of more than one person is a fact, but the claims that the defendants were conspiring against the Libyan state are dubious and controversial&quot; The case was then bound over to ordinary criminal court. The People&#x27;s Court was disbanded in 2005.

===Second trial===

The second trial took place in the Benghazi Appeals Court, beginning 8 July 2003. The judges were from Derna, a town neighboring Benghazi. Judges from Tripoli and Benghazi refused to take on the case due to the high level of public sentiment in those cities. Tight security measures were in place. Police officers with submachine guns guarded the venue as relatives of the children gathered in front.

The prosecutor stated that the case documents did not reflect the real number of children. The real number of children is 429. A report by prominent AIDS experts Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi was admitted in evidence.

Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzito were called to testify in person on behalf of the medics.

Professor Montagnier, the co-discoverer of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV), testified that the virus in the 393 children studied is a rare type found mostly in West Africa, but also throughout the continent. Montagnier told the court that the outbreak was probably started by an infected child admitted for treatment at the hospital. He said that injection was not the only possible means of infection: Any other manipulation involving penetration of the skin, or even multiple use of the same oxygen mask, could have transmitted the virus. Montagnier was certain that the epidemic at the hospital started about a year before the Bulgarian nurses were hired. He said he was familiar with the case before his first visit to Libya in 1999 because he was in the process of studying the cases of hundreds of HIV-positive children from El-Fatih that were being examined or treated in hospitals in Switzerland, France and Italy. At the time he was working on these cases, some of the children did not yet have the symptoms because the incubation period of the virus is about 10 years.

Under cross-examination, Montagnier stated that it is possible to preserve the virus and then reactivate it if it has been held in plasma. It could be kept active for several days, depending on how it is stored. He testified that he was not aware of the existence of the technical capacity in Libya for monitoring this kind of storage, either during the epidemic or currently. Montagnier testified that during his first visit, the health authorities in Libya and the management of the Benghazi hospital showed serious concern over the infection, and that at the time they had no idea of the cause of the epidemic&#x27;s spread.

When questioned by the Bulgarian defense, he affirmed that the infection could have started outside the hospital ward where the Bulgarians were working.

The Court ordered a new expert study of the case record. It received the report from the Libyan panel in December. Contrary to the findings of Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi, this panel concluded that there was no evidence that an in-hospital infection led to the AIDS outbreak at the Benghazi hospital that affected 426 children. The Libyan doctors concluded that the mass infections were more likely due to deliberate actions.

Two of the Libyan experts were brought in to testify for the prosecution, Awad Abudjadja of the Libyan national committee on AIDS and Busha Allo, head of the infectious diseases ward of the Al Jamahiriya hospital in Tripoli. They testified that the virus load in the blood of the infected children was too high, an indication that the infection was intentional.

Another Libyan virologist Salim Al-Agiri was summoned by the defence. He told the court that the infection at the Benghazi children&#x27;s hospital was due to lack of prevention and poor control.

The prosecutors called for the death penalty based on Nassya Nenova&#x27;s confession. Nenova admitted in writing to injecting children with contaminated products that she had gotten from the Palestinian Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh. According to the confession she was unaware that they contained HIV, and believed she was testing a new drug. Nenova withdrew her confession before the Libyan People&#x27;s Court in 2001 and told that court they were extracted under duress. Libyan law disregards confessions extracted with violence.

The prosecutors claimed that Kristiana Vulcheva acted as the mastermind. They introduced transcripts of her bank accounts and said she performed money transfers, paying the other defendants. The prosecutors averred that Vulcheva had a luxurious lifestyle and that she speaks Arabic, citing that as a further proof of her guilt.

One piece of material evidence which they said called for the death penalty were five containers of plasma protein found to contain four varieties of HIV according to a report by Awad Abudadjadja, a coordinator of the Libyan national committee on AIDS.

On 6 May 2004 the Criminal Court in Benghazi sentenced to death by firing squad: Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh, Kristiyana Valtcheva, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo, Valya Chervenyashka and Snezhana Dimitrova, finding them guilty for the intentional infection of 426 Libyan children with AIDS. Zdravko Georgiev was found guilty of illegal transactions in foreign currency and sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of 600 dinars. He was ordered released for time served.

In public after the conviction Colizzi called the scientific evidence used against them &quot;so irrational it&#x27;s unbelievable&quot; and said the verdict read &quot;like a bad spy film.&quot;

===Retrial===
The convictions were appealed to the Libyan Supreme Court which heard the case beginning on 29 March 2005. The defense urged the court to revoke the death sentences and remand the case to the lower courts for retrial. Under Libyan law, the court could not accept any new evidence, although the defense team argued that there was wrongly interpreted evidence during the court sessions so far. There were a number of delays and postponements. Eventually the Supreme Court revoked the death sentences and ordered a new trial.

Bulgarian president Georgi Parvanov said the court ruling &quot;confirmed our hope that justice in this case will prevail.&quot; President Parvanov added: &quot;The unfair death sentences were reversed. ...We hope that the swiftness and the effectiveness demonstrated by the Libyan court in the past days will help solve the case as soon as possible.&quot;

US State Department spokesman, Justin Higgins, described the decision as a &quot;positive development since it removes the risk of the death penalty being carried out. As we have made clear before, we believe a way should be found to allow the medics to return to their home.&quot; The Council of Europe welcomed the decision and said it hoped the new trial will &quot;comply with the internationally recognised standards of fairness and due process.&quot;

On 19 December 2006, the court pronounced its verdict in the retrial, all six were guilty, and again sentenced to death by firing squad. Following the verdict the court published a 100-page document on the website of &quot;Libya Today&quot; newspaper explaining its decision.

According to the document:
*The mothers of the HIV-infected children do not carry the virus
*Unnaturally high levels of HIV in the children&#x27;s blood testified to the fact that the infection was intentional.
*The infection only spread in the specific hospital rooms that the five nurses were serving.

The research by the World Health Organization showed that the HIV infected children also had Hepatitis C, which was proof that the infection was intentional and malicious. However, co-infection with Hepatitis was emphasized as indicating poor hygiene and reuse of syringes by the WHO study authors themselves, as well as all of the other non-Libyan studies used by the defense, the opposite conclusion to this analysis by the court.

The court also said that it was not willing to accept the fact that the five were tortured because another court has already waived this accusation, and found therefore that the defendants all confessed in full consciousness and without being subject to any violence or torture.

==Commutation to life sentence==
On 17 July 2007, Libya&#x27;s High Judicial Council, its highest judicial body, announced that the sentences would be converted to life imprisonment. Earlier that day, Libya negotiated a $400 million settlement with the families of 426 HIV victims. The Judicial Council received authority to review the case after the Supreme Court upheld the death sentences one week prior to the commutation. The Judicial Council is controlled by the government and can commute sentences or grant pardons.

==Terms of release==
On 24 July 2007, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy officially announced that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the prisoners, including the Palestinian doctor, who had been granted Bulgarian citizenship a month earlier. They left Libya on a French government plane, with the EU&#x27;s external affairs commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, and the then wife of the French President, Cécilia Sarkozy, who traveled twice to Libya.

During his investiture speech as President beginning of May 2007, Sarkozy had alluded to the nurses, declaring: &quot;France will be to the sides of the Libyan nurses detained since 8 years...&quot;

The six prisoners were released after extensive negotiations between the EU (including Bulgaria, and particularly France&#x27;s President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife) and Libya. As a result of the resolution of the crisis, negotiations for further restoring Libya&#x27;s ties to the EU are in progress.

A 1985 prisoner-exchange agreement between Bulgaria and Libya was the legal instrument used for the transfer; technically Libya did not free the medics but rather allowed them to serve their sentences in Bulgaria. On landing in Sofia, however, they were pardoned by the Bulgarian President, Georgi Parvanov.

The French President said that &quot;some humanitarian mediation&quot; by the &quot;friendly&quot; government of Qatar was decisive in helping with the release of the medics. Sarkozy claimed that no additional money was given by France, Bulgaria, or the European Union in addition to the amount stipulated in the private agreement previously reached with the Libyan families. He also confirmed that the release of the medics would allow him to perform an official visit to Libya to meet the Libyan president to negotiate other international issues.

The EU believes the six are innocent – Libya does not. Libya complained that the six should not have been pardoned once they reached Bulgaria. Libya petitioned the Arab League, and was supported by Oman, but, as of 31 July no definitive Arab League support had been decided on and no complaint had been filed with the EU.

The EU maintains it did not pay compensation to either the infected children or their families: according to Sarkozy, Europe did not pay &quot;the slightest financial compensation&quot; for the medics&#x27; release. However, the European Commission committed $461 million to the Benghazi International Fund. Also, Bulgaria cancelled a probably non-collectible $57 million debt owed by Libya, and humanitarian funds were made available for both the infecteds&#x27; treatment and for a new children&#x27;s hospital in Benghazi. Saif Gaddafi declared that the humanitarian aid to the Benghazi hospital amounted to &quot;not less than 300 million euros,&quot; which was denied by the French, who declared that it was largely overestimated. The Benghazi International Fund received from abroad 600 million Libyan dinars and Libya received promises of equipment and personnel to train of Libyan medics over a period of five years.

Initially Gaddafi&#x27;s son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, contradicted Sarkozy&#x27;s claim that no additional agreements had been made. In exchange for the release of the nurses, he said Nicolas Sarkozy not only signed with Gaddafi security, health care and immigration pacts (assistance with border management and scholarships for Libyan students in the EU) : according to Libyan sources cited by the Agence France-Presse, a $230 million (168 million euros) MILAN antitank missile sale was also part of the release deal.

Saif al-Islam announced the existence of these deals in an interview to &quot;Le Monde&quot;. EADS also confirmed it after Saif Gaddafi&#x27;s declarations, contradicting the official position of the Elysée Palace. Another 128 million euro contract would have been signed, according to Tripoli, with EADS for a TETRA radio system. The Socialist Party (PS) and the Communist Party (PCF) criticized a &quot;state affair&quot; and a &quot;barter&quot; with a &quot;rogue state&quot;. The leader of the PS, François Hollande, requested the opening of a parliamentary investigation. The Parliamentary Commission is expected to be created in October 2007. The French left asked for Cécilia Sarkozy to be heard by the Commission, as she had played an &quot;important role&quot; in the release of the six according to Pierre Moscovici (PS). Arnaud Montebourg had criticized her role, accusing her of having fast-tracked the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bernard Kouchner, while Sarkozy himself praised his wife.

He also linked the release of the Bulgarian nurses and of the Palestinian physician to bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom concerning the extradition of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, convicted in the Lockerbie bombing case.

Following the controversy lifted by Saif Gaddafi&#x27;s revelations concerning the arms deal, Sarkozy claimed that the arms contract was not connected to the liberation of the six, declaring: &quot;The contract was not linked to the release of the nurses. What do they criticize me for? Getting contracts? Creating jobs for French workers?&quot;.

Furthermore, Saif Gaddafi retracted his 1 August statements three days later, claiming that the arms deal and the agreement for the delivery of a nuclear reactor were not linked to the liberation of the Bulgarian nurses. He stated that the deal with EADS had started 18 months ago, information that was confirmed by EADS.

Despite these denegations, it is commonly accepted that the arms deal would not have been possible if the six hadn&#x27;t been freed, as Europe generally would have sided with Bulgaria on this issue. The head of the Bulgarian intelligence, General Kirtcho Kirov, declared that important arms contracts and oil contracts were at stake.

Additionally, President Sarkozy pledged to sell Libya three civil nuclear power stations as part of a package of trade and assistance that will boost the role of French companies in the oil-rich country. During his visit to Libya on 25 July 2007, Sarkozy signed an agreement of cooperation on civil nuclear technology. He decided to build three civil nuclear power stations for the Libyan state. According to Paris, the nuclear power stations are meant for desalinization of sea water, but &quot;Le Monde&quot; has pointed out that the Libyans quickly bypassed any reference to desalinization. This deal was criticized by the French left-wing and also by German governmental sources, including Deputy Foreign Minister Gernot Erler, Greens leader Reinhard Buetikofer and SPD deputy Ulrich Kelber. And during Tony Blair&#x27;s visit end of May 2007, the British group BP signed a natural gas contract for 900 million dollars.

Furthermore, &quot;Le Parisien&quot; alleged on 13 August 2007 that the agreement concerning nuclear technologies did not concern desalinization of sea water, but focused in particular on the ERP third-generation nuclear reactor, worth $3 billion. The Parisian newspaper cited Philippe Delaune, the deputy of the deputy director of international affairs of the CEA atomic agency. It is the main share-holder of Areva, the firm which products ERP reactors. Although the French President denied any relationship between the deal with Areva and the liberation of the six, &quot;Le Parisien&quot; points out a troubling chronology: Areva was called to present its products to Libya at the end of June 2007, a short time before the release of the six. The French Socialist Party, through the voice of Jean-Louis Bianco, declared that this deal was &quot;geopolitically irresponsible.&quot; The German government also denounced the agreement. Through Siemens, they retain 34% of the shares of Areva&#x27;s subsidiary in charge of building the ERP (Areva NP).

This information from &quot;Le Parisien&quot; was immediately denied by Areva. Areva&#x27;s spokesman did admit that negotiations had taken place early June 2007, but that no particular technology transfer had been agreed upon. Furthermore, Philippe Delaune, the CEA&#x27;s spokesman, added that in any case, any transfer concerning the ERP technology would take at least ten or fifteen years.

While Areva did admit that general negotiations had taken place, Nicolas Sarkozy formally dismissed all of the story, claiming it was &quot;false.&quot; Bulgarian President Georgy Parvanov also claimed that the arms and nuclear agreements were not related to the release of the nurses.

==Books==

Three of the Bulgarian medics published auto-biographical books regarding the trial. Kristiyana Vulcheva&#x27;s &quot;8 and a half years hostage of Ghaddafi&quot; premiered in 2007. Snezhana Dimitrova&#x27;s &quot;In Gaddafi&#x27;s Cage&quot; was published a month later. In 2009 Valya Cherveniashka wrote her version of the story together with Nikolay Yordanov in &quot;Notes from Hell&quot;. Her book was published in South Africa in 2010, and re-issued worldwide as e-book in Bulgarian, English and French. In 2018 the English language edition was released as audiobook.

==Diplomatic front==
There have been a number of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.

On 24 December 2005, it was announced that Libya, Bulgaria, the EU and the US had agreed on the creation of a fund, which may have helped to resolve the matter. In the end, Saif al-Islam was heavily credited with the resolution of the crisis.

The Bulgarian independent daily newspaper &quot;Novinar&quot; published a set of 12 cartoons mocking Gaddafi, Libyan justice and the Bulgarian government&#x27;s quiet diplomacy vis-à-vis the HIV trial. Publication of the cartoons caused outrage in Tripoli, and the Libyan ambassador in Sofia delivered a protest note to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. In response, the Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister, Feim Chaushev, and President Parvanov apologized and distanced themselves from the &quot;Novinar&quot; cartoons.

The six medics were again sentenced to death. EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini quickly expressed his shock at the verdict and called for the decision to be reviewed, as was done by the Bulgarian government and international organizations, including Amnesty International, the World Medical Association and the International Council of Nurses.

The Libyan foreign ministry said international response to the convictions and death sentences was disrespectful to the Libyan people. The foreign ministry also said (as reported by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;) &quot;The political stance expressed by the Bulgarian government, the EU countries and others is a clear bias to[wards] certain values that are likely to trigger wars, conflicts and cause enmity between religions and civilizations.&quot;

==International: official positions==
The trials have been condemned by The European Union, individual EU member nations, the United States and Russia.

The African Union (AU) Commission has expressed concern at what it calls &quot;politicization&quot; of the case. According to the Angola Press the AU Commission said all of Africa was monitoring the case with great interest, and that attempts to politicize the matter must stop forthwith. The AU also expressed solidarity with the families of the victims. It said people should not aggravate the tragic case, where 56 of the infected children have already succumbed to AIDS.

According to Sofia News Agency, The Arab League &quot;asked all countries not to politicize the issue, as the accused have still one more chance for appealing their sentence. The League also underlined the need to be compassionate to the HIV-infected Libyan children in order to curb the consequences of this painful human catastrophe&quot;.

The Council of Europe passed Recommendation 1726 in 2005 titled &quot;Serious human rights violations in Libya – Inhuman treatment of Bulgarian medical staff&quot;. The Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly severely condemned this verdict which is contrary to the fundamental values they uphold...The Parliamentary Assembly...categorically condemns the barbaric way in which they were treated in the first few months after their arrest and the torture and ill-treatment to which they were subjected.

European Commission opposed the position of the Libyan court decision to sentence to death.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Alexander Yakovenko, Spokesman: &quot;According to our information, the Bulgarian medics&#x27; lawyers intend to appeal this decision in the Supreme Court of Libya. For our part, we hope that an additional trial in Tripoli, &quot;in which all the facts and the opinions of people involved in this case will be comprehensively examined.&quot;

The United States State Department did not agree with the decision of the court.

==NGOs: official positions==
Many non-governmental organizations took a stand against the sentences.

In a statement on 6 May 2004, a statement from Amnesty International was released: &quot;We are shocked by the imposition of these death sentences and call for the Libyan authorities to immediately quash them.

The ICN President Christine Hancock wrote: &quot;The sentence is unjust, unwarranted and unacceptable.&quot; &quot;We implore the Libyan government to rectify this dreadful situation as quickly as possible. The health workers are being unfairly held responsible for a tragedy which has caused outrage in Libya.&quot;

Yoram Blachar, chairman of the WMA Council, said after a meeting of the WMA wrote: &quot;I appeal to the Libyan authorities to quash this sentence. It is completely unjustified.&quot;

Many newspapers and journals came out against the sentences.

==Development of media coverage==
In Libya, &quot;La&quot; magazine (issue 78) published its exposé about AIDS at the hospital, but was shut down. Initial Bulgarian coverage focused on a scandal in the wake of the arrests when the Bulgarian news journal &quot;24 hours&quot; of 24 February published an investigation of money laundering at Expomed entitled, &quot;How we [lost] USD 5,048,292 in Libya.&quot;

The trial received almost no public attention outside Libya and Bulgaria until an account by Eric Favereau was published in the French paper Libération on 2 June 2000 entitled &quot;Libye : Six Bulgares accusés d’être à l’origine de 393 cas de sida Assassins d’enfants ou boucs émissaires de la Libye ? &quot; (Libya: six Bulgarians accused of causing 392 Aids cases – Child killers or Libya&#x27;s Scapegoats?).
Libya had requested help and France, Italy and Switzerland had received some of the sick children. Eighty children were sent to France in May 1999. The Swiss paper Neue Zuercher Zeitung followed with the article &quot;Bulgarians as Scapegoats&quot; and the Washington Times picked up the story.

In April 2001 the trial gained brief attention after Muammar Gaddafi gave his speech at the African summit on HIV/AIDS implicating the CIA.
Cold War era GRU defector Viktor Suvorov would claim on Radio Free Europe that the conspiracy theory espoused by Gaddafi about CIA creating HIV and letting it loose in Africa had been invented by the KGB and was still promoted by Russian secret services, who were controlling Libya.

This theory was widely published throughout the Balkans in Serbian and Greek newspaper articles. On 2 July 2001 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran a story by Peter Finn, interviewing Prof. Luc Perrin. Perrin dismissed the allegations of a deliberate infection, and WHO spokesperson Melinda Henry told the Post that members of WHO missions in Libya in 1998 and 1999 felt that further study was necessary, but they &quot;were not invited back.&quot;

The case continued to receive minor attention until the conclusion of the second trial and the imposition of the death penalty on 6 May 2004, which provoked a major reaction, and worldwide television coverage.

==Libyan recognition==
On 24 February 2011, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, Libya&#x27;s newly resigned Minister of Justice, told Al Jazeera that the responsibility for the HIV infection lies totally with Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s regime.
However Abdul Jalil, who became head of the Libyan NTC and then de facto head of state after the assassination of Gaddafi, was one of the judges who twice upheld the nurses&#x27; death sentence.

==Timeline==
*27 January 2007: The Bulgarian newspaper &quot;24 Часа&quot; reports that Gaddafi&#x27;s elder son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi expressed hope that the death sentence could be halted and that &quot;a satisfactory solution could be found.&quot;
*15 February 2007: Dimitar Ignatov, a 25-year-old US citizen with Bulgarian origins, who launched two phony web pages for gathering money in support of Libya-jailed nurses, was arrested in a joint raid conducted by policemen from both countries. The money obtained in the scam had gone to his personal account in a Chicago bank.
*17 February 2007: Lawyer Hari Haralampiev told Darik News that this was the last possible deadline for appealing the sentence before the Supreme Cassation Court of Libya. The court will have to hold the first hearing on the appeal within two months. The court&#x27;s decision on the case will be the final one in the trial. The Supreme Court may reconfirm or waive the sentences. If they decide to nod the death sentences, then the case would go to the Supreme Court Council where the sentences can be either confirmed, changed or abolished.
*21 February 2007: Another &quot;entrepreneur&quot; decides to cash in on the &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; campaign. A One-Lev shop in the southwestern town of Blagoevgrad has started selling the ribbons, despite the fact that they have only been distributed for free since the beginning of the campaign.
*25 February 2007: The nurses and medic plead innocent to charges of slandering Libyan officers Djuma Misheri and Madjit Shol at a hearing in Criminal Court in Tripoli. The nurses once again pointed them out as their torturers on 1999. They told the court, &quot;Everything that the two officers claim is a contemptible lie,&quot; and showed the scars the men left on their bodies. The prosecutor demanded the maximum three-year prison sentence for the nurses in the slander case.
*28 February 2007: Libyan authorities appeal against the court&#x27;s decision to acquit Bulgarian doctor Zdravko Georgiev.
*9 March 2007: Bulgarian media quote Libyan Foreign Affairs Committee Secretary Suleiman Shahoumi as saying in Libya&#x27;s General People&#x27;s Congress that the medics would not be executed even if the court upheld their sentence.
*15 March 2007: Tottenham Hotspur and Bulgarian international footballer, Dimitar Berbatov, says he will wear a &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; armband during Spurs&#x27; matches.
*16 March 2007: Bulgarian journalist Georgi Gotev proposes that Bulgarian parties and voters co-operate to elect the nurses as Bulgaria&#x27;s representatives to the European Parliament to pressure both Libya and the EU.
*27 May 2007: The prisoners were acquitted of slandering Libyan police officers when they said they were tortured.
*17 July 2007: The Benghazi International Fund had started handing out to families the US$1 million per affected child that would spare the medics&#x27; lives, BBC Tripoli correspondent Rana Jawad reported.
*17 July 2007: Libya commutes death sentences to life imprisonment.
*24 July 2007: Libya extradited all of the Medics.
AP Story

*24 July 2007: Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov pardoned the six medics 45 minutes after they touched down on home soil at Sofia&#x27;s international airport. &quot;Certain of their innocence, in accordance with the powers vested in him, President Parvanov pardons the medics,&quot; foreign minister Ivailo Kalfin said after welcoming the medics back.
*28 July 2007: Libyan officials said they had sent a memo to the Arab League calling for action against Sofia – and a protest to the EU – because Bulgaria&#x27;s decision to pardon the medics has angered Tripoli. The BBC reported that the Libyan authorities had expected the freed medics to serve their life terms in Bulgarian jails, Prime Minister Baghdadi Mahmudi said, adding that the deal to free the medics had involved money put up by the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Qatar, while France had promised to provide equipment for the Benghazi hospital, where the infections had taken place – and training for Libyan medical staff over five years.
*10 August 2007: Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the leader of Libya, admitted that the confessions were extracted through torture with electric shocks and threats targeted at the medic&#x27;s families, and confirmed that some of the children had been infected with HIV before the medics arrived in Libya. He said that the guilty verdict of the Libyan courts had been based on &quot;conflicting reports&quot;, and said that:&quot;There is negligence, there is a disaster that took place, there is a tragedy, but it was not deliberate.&quot;

*24 February 2011: Mustafa Abdul Jalil, Libya&#x27;s newly resigned Minister of Justice, told Al Jazeera that the responsibility for the HIV infection lay entirely with Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s regime. However Mustafa Abdul Jalil, who became head of the Libyan NTC and then Libyan head of state after the very public murder of Muammar Gadaafi, was one of the judges who sentenced the nurses to death.

<text>This is a list of the Members of Parliament appointed as Escheator of Ulster, a notional &#x27;office of profit under the crown&#x27; which was used at times to resign from the Irish House of Commons.

The escheator was originally responsible for the administration of escheat , a common law doctrine that transfers the real property of a person who has died without heirs to the crown or state.

The office was formerly substantive. It was founded in 1605, when the escheatorship for Ireland was divided among the provinces of Connaught, Leinster, Munster, and Ulster.

==Substantive holders==
* bef. 1760: John King

==Members of the Irish House of Commons==
* 1799: Luke Fox (Clonmines)

<doc id="1036559" wikidata="Q12060538" url="?curid=1036559" title="Hornsby railway station">
<text>Hornsby railway station is a suburban railway station located at the junction of the Main Northern and North Shore lines, serving the Sydney suburb of Hornsby. It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore Line and T9 Northern Line services and intercity Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line services, as well as NSW TrainLink regional services.

==History==
The station opened on 17 September 1886 as Hornsby, but was renamed Hornsby Junction on 1 November 1894. This was due to the construction of Normanhurst station to the south, which was initially named Hornsby as it was located in what was the more densely populated area of Hornsby at the time. Naming the station Hornsby Junction was an attempt to avoid confusion, but it was realised that having two Hornsby stations was still very confusing. On 1 May 1900, the suburb and station to the south was renamed Normanhurst, and Hornsby Junction reverted to Hornsby.

On 1 January 1890, Hornsby became a junction station with the opening of the North Shore line to St Leonards. In 1894, a third platform was built along with a locomotive depot to the east of the station. Hornsby was the northern extremity of the electrified network from 1930 until it was extended to Gosford in 1960. The wires did continue north of the station as far as the Hornsby Maintenance Depot.

The station was extensively upgraded in 1986, with lifts complete an upgraded footbridge at the southern end of the station.

As part of the CityRail Clearways Project, a fifth platform was constructed for use by through northbound trains. To allow for the new line, the Hornsby Signal Box was shifted 120 metres in 2007. The new platform opened on 16 March 2009, with the existing Platform 4 becoming a turnback platform for Northern line trains. The additional platform allows extra trains to run on the Northern line via the Epping to Chatswood line and improves reliability. As Hornsby is both an originating and terminating point for some services, on 10 July 2003 the communications system in a Millennium Train failed because the train&#x27;s software could not compute that the origin and destination of the service had the same name.

<doc id="1036577" wikidata="Q3302130" url="?curid=1036577" title="Cardiac electrophysiology">
<text>Cardiac electrophysiology is a branch of cardiology and basic science focusing on the electrical activities of the heart. The term is usually used in clinical context, to describe studies of such phenomena by invasive (intracardiac) catheter recording of spontaneous activity as well as of cardiac responses to programmed electrical stimulation - clinical cardiac electrophysiology. However, cardiac electrophysiology also encompasses basic research and translational research components. Specialists studying cardiac electrophysiology, either clinically or solely through research, are known as cardiac electrophysiologists.

==Description==
Electrophysiological (EP) studies are performed to assess complex arrhythmias, elucidate symptoms, evaluate abnormal electrocardiograms, assess risk of developing arrhythmias in the future, and design treatment. These procedures include therapeutic methods (typically radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation) in addition to diagnostic and prognostic procedures. Other therapeutic modalities used in this field include antiarrhythmic drug therapy and implantation of pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy devices. 

==Electrophysiological study==

The cardiac electrophysiology (EP) study typically measures the response of myocardium to programmed electrical stimulation (PES) on specific pharmacological regimens in order to assess the likelihood that the regimen will successfully prevent potentially fatal sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation VF (VF) in the future. Sometimes a &quot;series&quot; of EP study drug trials must be conducted to enable the cardiologist to select the one regimen for long-term treatment that best prevents or slows the development of VT or VF following PES. Such studies may also be conducted in the presence of a newly implanted or newly replaced cardiac pacemaker or ICD.

== Physician specialists ==
A specialist in cardiac electrophysiology is known as an electrophysiologist, or &quot;heart electrician&quot; in layman&#x27; terms. Cardiac electrophysiology is a subspecialty of cardiology in most countries and usually requires two or more years of EP fellowship training after a general cardiology residency. In early 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promoted cardiac electrophysiology to its own specialty category in the United States. Cardiac electrophysiologists are trained to perform interventional cardiac electrophysiology studies and cardiac rhythm management device implantations. 

=== Research cardiac electrophysiologist ===
Cardiac electrophysiologists specialize in a sub-area of electrophysiology, which in turn is a sub-area of physiology. This specialization usually requires education at the doctoral (PhD, DSc, or MD/DO) level to become a principal investigator for research projects. The area of research is often multi-disciplinary involving chemistry, bioelectrics, biology, and biomedical engineering. The flagship tools used by cardiac electrophysiologists overlap with the toolbox of the neuroscientist including patch clamp and optical mapping.

==Allied professionals ==
Mapping specialists (EP techs, EP physiologists) are typically educated up to the Bachelor&#x27;s or Master&#x27;s level and are employed by either a cardiac electrophysiology company or department. Often international certification such as Certified Electrophysiology Specialist (CEPS) by the International Board of Heart Rhythm Examiners (IBHRE) or EHRA Certified Electrophysiology Specialist (ECES) or equivalent is required.

==Subdiscipline==
Cardiac electrophysiology is a relatively young subdiscipline of cardiology and internal medicine. It was developed during the mid-1970s by Hein J. J. Wellens, professor of medicine at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands and attending cardiologist at the Academic Hospital in Maastricht. In 1980 the first microprocessor based stimulator was developed there.

==Textbook==
The author of the definitive textbook in the field is by the late Mark E. Josephson, former Robinette Professor of Medicine and chief of cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and attending cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. The most recent published edition of &quot;Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology: Techniques and Interpretations&quot; is the 6th edition in 2020.

==Professional societies==
The Heart Rhythm Society, founded in 1979, promotes education and advocacy for cardiac arrhythmia professionals (including cardiac electrophysiologists) and patients. European Heart Rhythm Association, a part of European Society of Cardiology, is active in Europe.

== Certification ==
Founded in 1985 as NASPExAM, the International Board of Heart Rhythm Examiners (IBHRE) offers knowledge based board exams for physicians and allied health professionals working in the field of cardiac electrophysiology and cardiac rhythm device management. European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) provides knowledge and practical competency based certification to physicians and allied health professionals as well as accreditation of cardiac electrophysiology training centres in Europe and neighbouring countries. 

==Mapping systems==
Electroanatomic mapping uses electric and magnetic fields to create three dimensional models of heart structures using specialized catheters.

<doc id="1036579" wikidata="Q972884" url="?curid=1036579" title="Whit Stillman">
<text>John Whitney Stillman (born January 25, 1952) is an American writer-director and actor known for his 1990 film &quot;Metropolitan&quot;, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He is also known for his other films, &quot;Barcelona&quot; (1994), &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998), &quot;Damsels in Distress&quot; (2011), as well as his most recent film, &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot;, released in 2016.

==Early life, family and education==
Stillman was born in 1952 in Washington, D.C., to Margaret Drinker (née Riley), from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a Democratic politician, John Sterling Stillman, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs under President John F. Kennedy (a classmate of Stillman&#x27;s father at Harvard), from Washington, D.C. His great-grandfather was businessman James Stillman; his great-great-grandfather, Charles Stillman, founded Brownsville, Texas.

Stillman was raised in Cornwall, New York, and experienced depression during puberty. &quot;I was very depressed when I was 11 or 12,&quot; he recounted to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. &quot;I was sent to the leading Freudian child psychologist in Washington, D.C. It was heck. The last thing I needed to talk about was guilt about sex.&quot; However, when his parents separated, he found that his depression ceased. &quot;I actually felt healthier.&quot;

Stillman&#x27;s godfather was E. Digby Baltzell, a University of Pennsylvania professor and chronicler of the American upper class.

He attended the Collegiate School in New York City, Potomac School in McLean, Virginia, and Millbrook School in Stanford, New York. He majored in history at Harvard University, where he wrote for its student newspaper &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;.

==Career ==
===Early career===
After graduating from Harvard in 1973, Stillman began working as an editorial assistant at Doubleday in New York City, followed by a stint as a junior editor at &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, a conservative magazine. Stillman has subsequently distanced himself from his work for the &quot;Spectator,&quot; stating that he now hates &quot;to be drawn into ideological debates&quot; and prefers to remain &quot;apolitical&quot;.

He was introduced to some film producers from Madrid and persuaded them that he could sell their films to Spanish-language television in the US. He worked for the next few years in Madrid and Barcelona as a sales agent for directors Fernando Trueba and Fernando Colomo, and sometimes acted in their films, usually playing comic Americans, as in Trueba&#x27;s film &quot;Sal Gorda&quot;.

===1990s===
&quot;Metropolitan&quot; (1990)
Stillman wrote the screenplay for &quot;Metropolitan&quot; from 1984 to 1988 while running an illustration agency in New York, and he financed the film by selling the insider rights to his apartment (for $50,000) and with the contributions of friends and relatives. Loosely based on Stillman&#x27;s Manhattan days, with his divorced mother during the week of Christmas break 1969 during his first year at Harvard, &quot;Metropolitan&quot; tells the story of the alienated Princetonian Tom Townsend&#x27;s introduction to the &quot;Sally Fowler Rat Pack&quot; (SFRP), a small group of preppy, Upper East Side Manhattanites making the rounds at debutante balls during Christmas break of their first year in college. Though he is a socialist deeply skeptical of the SFRP&#x27;s upper-class values, Tom (Edward Clements) grows increasingly attached to the cynical Nick (Chris Eigeman) and plays an important part, of which he is largely unaware, in the life of Audrey (Carolyn Farina), a young debutante. Many of the exclusive interior locations were lent to Stillman by family friends and relatives.

The film premiered and was screened as part of the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Metropolitan&quot; was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize (Drama) at the 1990 Sundance Film Festival. Stillman won Best First Feature at the 6th Independent Spirit Awards and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1991 for Best Original Screenplay. He won the 1990 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best New Director. The movie was a financial success, grossing about $3 million on a budget of $225,000. In an interview Stillman said of the film, &quot;The material seemed pretty rich, almost rank. And perhaps it&#x27;s better approaching a subject people feel strongly about, even if that strong feeling is hatred, than something colorless and unspecific. Also, I love anachronism and this was the chance to film, essentially, a costume picture set in the present day or recent past. But a large part of the idea was to disguise our pitifully low budget by filming the most elegant subject available.&quot;

&quot;Barcelona&quot; (1994)

&quot;Barcelona&quot;, his first studio-financed film, was inspired by his own experiences in Spain during the early 1980s. Stillman has described the film as &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, but with the title referring to two men rather than one. The men, Ted and Fred, experience the awkwardness of being in love in a foreign country culturally and politically opposed to their own.

&quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998)

&quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; was based loosely on Stillman&#x27;s experiences in various Manhattan nightclubs, including Studio 54. The film concerns Ivy League and Hampshire graduates falling in and out of love in the disco scene of Manhattan in the &quot;very early 1980s&quot;. Chloë Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale play roommates with opposite personalities who frequent disco clubs together. &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; concludes a trilogy loosely based on Stillman&#x27;s life and contains many references to the previous two films: a character considers a move to Spain to work for American ad agencies there after meeting with the &quot;Barcelona&quot; character of Ted Boynton, and &quot;Metropolitan&quot;&#x27;s heroine Audrey Rouget reappears briefly as a successful publisher, as do a few other characters from that film, as clubgoers. In 2000 Stillman published a novelization of the film, titled &quot;The Last Days of Disco, with Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards&quot;. The novelization won the French 2014 Prix Fitzgerald Award.

===2000s===
Stillman stated in 2006 that he was working on several unfinished scripts. He had been slated to direct a film adaptation of Christopher Buckley&#x27;s novel &quot;Little Green Men&quot;, but in a 2009 interview, Stillman said the adaptation is &quot;[not] happening, at least with me.&quot; He was writing another film, &quot;Dancing Mood&quot;, set in Jamaica in the 1960s, which was not produced.

&quot;Damsels in Distress&quot; (2011)

After a 13-year hiatus, Stillman released his fourth film, &quot;Damsels in Distress&quot;, starring Greta Gerwig, Adam Brody, Hugo Becker and Lio Tipton (credited as Analeigh Tipton). It premiered September 10 at the 2011 Venice Film Festival as the closing film and received favorable reviews. The film is &quot;about three young women at an East Coast university, the transfer student that joins their group and the young men they become entangled with.&quot;

&quot;The Cosmopolitans&quot; (2014)
In 2014, Stillman wrote and directed the pilot episode of the TV series &quot;The Cosmopolitans&quot; for Amazon Studios on August 28, 2014, the pilot was available and Amazon Prime users could watch the pilot episode and vote to pick it up for a full series. On July 11, 2016, Tom Grater reported that Stillman was commissioned by Amazon to write six new scripts to continue his original pilot film for &quot;The Cosmopolitans&quot;.

&quot;I explained to Amazon that I don’t like outlining or projecting what something’s going to be. I like to allow a story to arise as I’m writing scripts. I find it horrible when I try to think of something for the plot without really being on the ground and seeing where it goes. I was really resistant to do the mini-bible. So I gave them something, but I really didn’t want to do it that way. They also knew about the film, so they commissioned six scripts for the first season that they were going to let me postpone until I finished this film, which is now. So in ten days, we’ll be full on with that. It’s been really good because I think I was waiting for the idea I really want, and I think I have that now. It’s not exactly Paris, it’s a European idea. So it will be Chloe and Adam Brody. We’ll keep the pilot, that’s part of the story, but we’ll be going a different place with it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;- Whit Stillman, shortly before the world premiere of &quot; Love &amp; Friendship&quot; at Sundance

In 2016, Amazon stated that: &quot;Our agreements with the content provider don’t allow purchases of this title at this time.&quot;

&quot;The bulk of the pilot of “The Cosmopolitans” involves several of Stillman’s signature subjects. The first is a party: the male trio, plus Aubrey, head to a soirée at the posh apartment of an arrogantly wealthy Parisian acquaintance (or perhaps a German in Paris), Fritz (Freddy Åsblom). For Stillman, parties are laboratories where possibilities arise suddenly from the close and quickly ricocheting contacts of social atoms—and where social rules, hidden beneath the murky surface of daily life, emerge more clearly, in ritualized isolation. The second is something that happens at the party: a dance, but a formally patterned one where the rules are the very subject.&quot;&lt;br&gt;- Richard Brody, 27 August 2014

&quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot; (2016)

A film version of one of Jane Austen&#x27;s early short novels &quot;Lady Susan&quot; was reported by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; on January 22, 2016. This followed the indication that Little, Brown and Company would be publishing the screenplay adapted by Stillman The film premiered in January 2016 at the Sundance Film Festival under the title of &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot;. Although the plot of the film is adapted from &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, the actual title used (&quot;Love &amp; Friendship)&quot; is from another, unrelated early epistolary novel by Austen, unpublished during her lifetime. It received universal acclaim from critics.

The promotional announcement by Little, Brown and Company summarized Stillman&#x27;s adaptation stating; &quot;Recently widowed, Lady Susan arrives, unannounced, at her brother-in-law&#x27;s estate to wait out colorful rumors about her dalliances circulating through polite society. While there, she becomes determined to secure a new husband for herself, and one for her reluctant debutante daughter, Frederica, too. As Lady Susan embarks on a controversial relationship with a married man, seduction, deception, broken hearts, and gossip all ensue. With a pitch-perfect Austenian sensibility, Stillman breathes new life into Austen&#x27;s work, making it his own by adding original narration from a character comically loyal to the story&#x27;s fiendishly manipulative heroine, Lady Susan.&quot;

==Filmmaking style==

Stillman wrote and directed three comedies of manners released in the 1990s: &quot;Metropolitan&quot; (1990), &quot;Barcelona&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998); he published a novel based on the last of these films. After completing his film trilogy, Stillman left independent comedy and started researching and writing a series of scripts set abroad. In August 1998 (shortly after &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; was released) he left his loft conversion in Manhattan&#x27;s SoHo and moved to Paris. He returned to New York in 2010.

A fourth film, &quot;Damsels in Distress&quot;, was released in 2011, premiering out of competition as the closing film at the 68th Venice International Film Festival. &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2012 compared Stillman to Terrence Malick, another filmmaker who has &quot;come to owe a good part of their mystique to the very paucity of their oeuvre...The lengthy gaps in between (films) have created expectations that are hard to fulfil, and admirers have been inclined to overestimate their achievement.&quot; A reviewer at &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that the reason for the long gaps between his films is that &quot;Stillman is sometimes simply too damn smart for his own good. You can&#x27;t always tell at whom he&#x27;s poking fun, or why, and it becomes unfortunately easy to typecast him as the WASP answer to Woody Allen and conclude that his movies are insufferably irritating documents of privilege. He himself is aware of that possibility the whole time, and bastes his entire worldview in a rueful, ironic-romantic glaze.&quot;

Stillman&#x27;s effectiveness at the box-office has been mixed. He filmed &quot;Metropolitan&quot; for about $250,000, according to Stillman, with a box-office return of about $3 million. &quot;Barcelona&quot; was then filmed on a budget of under $3 million, returning just under $8 million. His third film was not a box-office success; its budget of $8 million returned about $3 million. Stillman, in an AOL interview following the twenty-fifth anniversary of &quot;Metropolitan&quot;, refers to himself as having been put into &quot;director&#x27;s prison&quot; for more than 10 years before he made &quot;Damsels&quot;. His 2016 film &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot;, a comedy based on a Jane Austen story, was a box-office success, grossing more than $20 million worldwide against a production budget of $3 million.

25-Year Wexner Center film retrospective

The Wexner Center for the Arts at the Ohio State University held a 25-year retrospective of the career and films of Stillman including his film titled &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot;. At the time of the retrospective, Stillman was asked: &quot;Your films all have a sort of costume drama sensibility, but without the costumes, and now you&#x27;ve made a costume drama, period dress and all.&quot; Stillman responded by stating that: &quot;&quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot; doesn&#x27;t loom as a costume drama, because it&#x27;s a pretty funny comedy, so it&#x27;s really not what you might anticipate. It&#x27;s not &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; in any way, shape or form. There are a lot of very good English comic actors who have done the supporting parts and really shine. I love Jane Austen. I sort of wanted something of my own to work on between paid script writing assignments. It&#x27;s good that I had so much time with no producer or studio executive wanting delivery quickly because it&#x27;s an incredibly funny novella she wrote, but hard to read and hard to dramatize. It&#x27;s an epistolary form from the 18th century and there are all these very funny ideas and lines buried within. It&#x27;s kind of an inaccessible format and it was a long process of adaptation.&quot;

 Criterion Collection Release 

In April 2016, The Criterion Collection released a retrospective box set edition of &quot;Metropolitan&quot;, &quot;Barcelona&quot;, and &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot;, available on Blu-ray and DVD. Stillman himself oversaw the digital transfers of the films and recorded audio commentaries along with members of the casts and crews.

==Bibliography==
Stillman wrote a novelization of &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux under the same title, with the added subtitle &quot;...With Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards&quot;. It won the French 2014 Prix Fitzgerald Award. Stillman also wrote the novelization of his 2016 film &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot;.

<doc id="1036581" wikidata="Q6805500" url="?curid=1036581" title="Media Lab Europe">
<text>Media Lab Europe (MLE) was a research institute in Dublin, Ireland, based on the MIT Media Lab concept. Created in 2000, it went into voluntary liquidation early in 2005. MLE was one of two such projects, the other of which, Media Lab Asia, split from MIT in 2003.

==Creation==
MLE was created in July 2000 and was initiated by the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. The lab received start-up funding of 35 million Euro from Irish Government, as well as sponsorship from industrial research partners (see below). It was located in a former Guinness warehouse in the historic Liberties area and was to have been a flagship project for the Irish Government&#x27;s Digital Hub project, an urban renewal scheme aiming to encourage digital media companies to locate in the area. The MLE board initially included celebrity Bono from U2: in 2002, he stepped down in favour of fellow band member The Edge whose technical interests better fit the laboratory&#x27;s mission and who (unlike Bono) regularly attended meetings of the board.

==Work==
The lab focused on innovation in digital technology and human-machine interaction. MLE was said to have managed to recreate the creative play research atmosphere of the MIT Media Lab. By 2004 MLE was in full swing, and in the lab&#x27;s short lifespan the researchers produced 21 refereed journal articles, 59 refereed full papers for conferences, and 62 refereed shorter papers for conferences, for a total of 142 refereed works. The facility achieved international recognition for a range of its work including EEG based mind-computer interfaces; the BumpList and Iso-phone. The latter two projects received honorary mention at the 2004 Prix Ars Electronica. Furthermore, MLE researchers regularly contributed to international research forums of the European Commission, the Association for Computing Machinery, and others concerned with advancing technologies and their constructive uses.

MLE held a highly successful international conference on &quot;New Interfaces for Musical Expression&quot; (NIME-02) in May 2002. In May 2004, in conjunction with Ireland&#x27;s hosting of the EU Presidency, MLE and the Department of Education and Science assembled &quot;New Futures for Learning in the Digital Age&quot;. MLE also organised an associated international symposium &quot;Incremental Progress or Fundamental Change?&quot;, featuring Prof. Seymour Papert, to question attitudes and progress in digital learning.

===Recognition issue===
MIT refused to accredit any degrees coming from the lab and re-iterated this refusal in 2005 when the Irish government sought accreditation as a condition of renewed funding. Concerns had been raised by the Irish academic community as early as 2001, in the Wall Street Journal.

==Demise==
The lab was unfortunate to have been founded just as the internet bubble collapsed and with it the corporate ability to invest in projects of this sort. Compounding difficulties, some members of the Irish university sector expressed concerns about the government money invested in the Lab, Although, in a call for proposals, the Higher Education Authority commented &quot;The HEA is delighted at the level of collaboration (between MLE and Irish universities) which has been achieved in the short time since Media Lab Europe was established.&quot;

2004 saw increasing emphasis on the long-term financial viability of the project and it encountered funding difficulties: it did not seem likely that the lab would become self-financing with its original funding model in the near future and the Irish government appeared unwilling to provide sufficient further support. On 14 January 2005 MLE&#x27;s Board announced that the lab would be put into voluntary liquidation and close. In the declaration of insolvency Ernst &amp; Young, the liquidator, noted a surplus of €325,000.

Commenting in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the MIT Media Lab, said that the research at MLE was &quot;beyond [his] wildest expectations&quot;; he was critical of European companies for their unwillingness to invest in the lab and said: &quot;Many visitors to MLE thought the work in Dublin was more edgy than at MIT. In this regard, Ireland received what it asked for in spades. The failing was economic and the financial model was freakishly untimely.&quot;

However, it was also reported in the media (see for example Weckler 2005) that both internal and government reports commissioned when the lab first reported financial difficulties came to critical conclusions about the initial elements of the labs operations and practices. For example, it was noted that the number of patents produced by the lab up to 2004 was very small, though the account did not reflect on how long processes of research development and patent application would normally take.

In additional reports, the working environment at MediaLab Europe was described as &quot;hell&quot;, &quot;chaos&quot; and &quot;inmates running the asylum&quot;, while independent assessments of the Laboratory&#x27;s operation commissioned by MLE noted significant improvements in management and operations since mid-2003. It was also reported in (Smith 2005) that the Irish government would have provided further but limited funding, if the board had agreed to governance changes. Inevitably such brief, unofficial reports cannot present the full picture of these complex negotiations, in which both parties discussed a range of possibilities but ultimately found closure of the lab to be the only mutually-agreeable option.

==Partners==
Research partners included Allied Irish Banks, BT, Ericsson, Intel, and Orange. The lab also cooperated with several Irish universities and the Higher Education Authority.

==Related organisations==
The Irish Government has funded a new research organisation at the same location, the National Digital Research Centre, with a more applied focus.

MLE was not the only attempt to recreate the innovative spirit of the MIT Media Lab: Media Lab Asia was founded by MIT and the Indian government in 2001, but it parted ways with MIT in 2003. Consistent with the premise of MIT&#x27;s OpenCourseWare movement, it seems there may be no substitute for &quot;being there.&quot;

<text>Roy Chadwick, CBE, FRSA, FRAeS (30 April 1893 – 23 August 1947) was an English aircraft design engineer for the Avro Company. 

Born at Marsh Hall Farm, Farnworth, Widnes, the son of the mechanical engineer Charles Chadwick, he was the chief designer for Avro and was responsible for practically all of their aeroplane designs. He is famous in particular for designing the Avro Lancaster bomber, its follow-up Avro Lincoln and preliminary designs of the Avro Vulcan V-bomber. He also converted the Lincoln into the Shackleton. His Avro Yorks carried one-third of the entire British tonnage during the Berlin Airlift. Chadwick married Mary Gomersall in 1921 and had two daughters.

==Early life==
Chadwick attended St Clements Church School in Urmston, then studied at night school from 1907 to 1911 at the Manchester Municipal College of Technology whilst training as a draughtsman at the British Westinghouse Electrical Company in Trafford Park under George Edwin Bailey of Metropolitan-Vickers.

==Avro years==
At age 18 in September 1911, he began work as Alliott Verdon-Roe&#x27;s (later Sir Alliott) personal assistant and the firm&#x27;s draughtsman at A.V. Roe and Company, Avro, based at Brownsfield Mill, Manchester. Under the direction of A.V. Roe, Chadwick drafted the Avro D, a two-seater tractor biplane, the Avro E, which was converted to a floatplane, and in 1912, the Avro F, the world&#x27;s first monoplane and enclosed-cabin machine. He then worked on the draughtsmanship for the Avro 500, 501 and 503, which led to Avro&#x27;s World War I light bomber and trainer, the Avro 504.

In 1915 at age 22, Chadwick designed the Avro Pike, a twin-engined pusher biplane bomber. That year, when starting to design entire aircraft, he was based at Hamble, near Southampton. In 1918 he was appointed Avro&#x27;s Chief Designer when Avro had about 40 employees. He designed the Avro Baby and in 1920, the Avro Aldershot, the world&#x27;s largest single-engined bomber and variants of the Aldershot, the Avro Ava and the Avro Andover.

In 1925 he designed an all-metal plane, the single-seater fighter Avro Avenger and in 1926, the Avro Avian in which Bert Hinkler flew the first solo flight from England to Australia in 1928. In 1928, he moved back to the Avro factory in Woodford, Greater Manchester, used by BAE Systems until its closure in 2012. That year, he designed an eight-passenger high wing plane, the Avro 10 and a four-passenger version, the Avro 4. In 1929, he designed the RAF trainer, the Avro Tutor, a smaller version, the Avro Cadet and an enclosed version, the Avro Commodore. This was followed by the Avro Anson, used in World War II for training crews and as transport aircraft.
In the late 1930s work began on a long-range bomber, the Avro Manchester, followed by the Avro Lancaster (Avro 683) of which 7,300 were built. In 1939, production of Avro aircraft was moved to a new factory at Greengate in Chadderton, owned by BAE Systems until its closure in 2012. In 1941, he designed a long-range transport, the Avro York and larger variants of the Lancaster, the Avro Lincoln and the Avro Lancastrian.

After the war, he designed Britain&#x27;s first pressurised airliner, the Avro Tudor, based around the Lancaster-derivative Avro Lincoln, though few were built and also the Avro Shackleton in 1946. His final involvement with Avro was overseeing the initial designs of the Avro Vulcan (Avro 698) from 1946. Author Harald Penrose describes Chadwick in &quot;British Aviation&quot; as &quot;Artistic with unbounded enthusiasm and unsparing energy, Roy Chadwick was a great designer of intuitive diagnostic ability rather than a scientist, yet like all great masters was in step with the tide of knowledge and contemporary outlook.&quot; Chadwick was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1943 Birthday Honours for his contribution to the design of the Lancaster and in particular for the adaptations he made to it in preparation for the low-level attacks on the German dams, during the Dam Busters raid Operation Chastise. The same year he was granted the Honorary Freedom of the City of London.

==Death==
Chadwick died on 23 August 1947 in a crash during the takeoff of the prototype Avro Tudor 2 &quot;G-AGSU&quot; from Woodford Aerodrome, in the vicinity of Shirfold Farm. The accident was due to an error in an overnight servicing in which the aileron cables were inadvertently crossed. His bust is displayed at the RAF Club in London, among other notable designers, and at the Chadwick Centre at the International Bomber Command Centre in Lincoln.

==Legacy==
The Chadwick Centre at the International Bomber Command Centre in Lincolnshire is named in honour of Chadwick. He is commemorated by a blue plaque on the surviving office building of the Avro factory at Greengate. and a blue plaque at 38 Chessel Avenue in Bitterne, Hampshire, where he lived from 1922 to 29 when the AVRO design team was based nearby at Hamble.

The A523 bypass around Poynton, which crosses the former Woodford Aerodrome runway, has been named Roy Chadwick Way in his honour. Another Roy Chadwick Way has been created in BAE Systems&#x27; new Enterprise Zone at the site of the old Samlesbury Aerodrome.

<doc id="1036593" wikidata="Q6730604" url="?curid=1036593" title="Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West">
<text>Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West is an Independent Local Radio station based in Liverpool, England, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Greatest Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Merseyside, Cheshire, and south west Lancashire. The station forms part of Greatest Hits Radio North West.

As of December 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 331,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

== Early history ==
Originally it was known as &quot;1548 City Talk&quot;, this service existed between 1989 and 1991 originally between 0700 and 1900 on weekdays. It was not a success, and a &quot;Gold&quot; format of music was introduced as the station initially became &quot;Radio City Gold&quot;, and then &quot;City Gold&quot;.

Radio City was purchased by EMAP in 1998, and City Gold was rebranded Magic 1548 as part of the network of Magic stations on AM. In December 2001, EMAP decided that it was more economical for the Magic network to share off-peak programmes and in line with the other Magic AM stations began networking between 10am-2pm, 7pm-10am, and then 2am-6am (because of Pete Price&#x27;s phone-in, which switched stations in January 2006). This resulted in Magic 1548 having more local programming on weekdays. During these hours it was simply known as Magic, although there were local commercial breaks, and local news on the hour.

In January 2003, the station ceased networking with the London station, Magic 105.4, and a regional network was created with Piccadilly Magic 1152 in Manchester at the hub at the weekend and Magic 1152 in Newcastle during the week. During networked hours, local adverts are aired, as well as a local news summary on the hour.

From July 2006, more networking was introduced across the Northern Magic AM network which meant only 4 hours a day was to be presented from the local studios, between 06:00 and 10:00am. In April 2012 Magic 1548, inline with the majority of other Magic North stations, dropped local weekend breakfast shows.

Between March 2013 and December 2014, weekday breakfast was syndicated from Piccadilly Magic 1152 in Manchester.

=== Radio City 2 ===
Magic 1548 was rebranded as Radio City 2 in January 2015, as part of the launch of Bauer&#x27;s City 2 network. Along with the rebranding, local news and traffic bulletins were reintroduced.

In July 2015, Bauer submitted a formal request to OFCOM to swap Radio City 2&#x27;s format and frequencies with that of Radio City Talk. The company proposed to reintroduce local breakfast and drive time programming to the station and an enhanced local news service, alongside programming provided by the City 2 network. The request was approved three months later and the switchover took place on Monday 7 December 2015.

=== Greatest Hits Radio ===
On 7 January 2019, Radio City 2 rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West.

On 1 September 2020, the station was merged with several local radio stations to form a new regional station, Greatest Hits Radio North West, as part of an expansion of the Bauer network. 

The national weekday breakfast show was broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Liverpool studios at St Johns Beacon until December 2024, when programming was moved to Bauer’s Manchester network centre. 

After Wire FM closed down, GHR Liverpool &amp; The North West inherited the 107.2 MHz FM frequency. 

== Programming ==
Networked programming originates from Bauer&#x27;s London, Manchester and Edinburgh studios.

=== News ===
Bauer&#x27;s Manchester newsroom broadcasts local news bulletins for Liverpool hourly from 6am-7pm on weekdays, and from 7am-1pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines are broadcast on the half hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked bulletins on weekend afternoons, originating from Bauer&#x27;s Manchester newsroom.

<text>Ashley Chadbourne McKinley (June 23, 1896 – February 11, 1970) was an accomplished American aerial photographer and colonel in the U.S. Army Air Corps who helped pioneer aviation at subzero temperatures. He accompanied Richard E. Byrd as an aerial photographer on his expedition to the South Pole.

==Early career==
McKinley joined Battery A of the Missouri National Guard on June 21, 1916, and served on the Mexican Border until December 21 of the same year. Following the United States&#x27; entry into the First World War, he enlisted in the United States Army Signal Corps on August 7, 1917, and became a dirigible pilot. He was commissioned as a 1st lieutenant in the Officer&#x27;s Reserve Corps on December 7, 1917, to date from November 27. He was placed on active duty on December 16, 1917.

During World War I, he commanded a balloon observation company. He later taught aerial photography and surveying. He was promoted to the rank of captain on November 20, 1918, shortly after the armistice.

==Interwar period==
Due to the post war draw down, McKinley&#x27;s appointment as captain was vacated and he was made a 2nd lieutenant in the Army Air Service on September 21, 1920 (to rank from July 1, 1920). He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on April 12, 1921.

On April 3, 1926, McKinley resigned from the Army to begin an aerial surveying and photography service. In 1928–1929, he was a photographer for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition. He was one of four men (along with Richard Byrd, Bernt Balchen and Harold June) aboard the first aircraft to fly over the South Pole on November 29, 1929. He was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross by Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley on July 9, 1930.

==World War II==
In 1941, as the United States prepared to enter the Second World War, McKinley rejoined the Army Air Corps as a major. He was in charge of the cold-weather operations of the Army Air Force at Ladd Field in Fairbanks, Alaska. McKinley was the first person to suggest that U.S. aircraft be constructed to operate in subzero temperatures and that the Air Force should build a facility to test aircraft in subzero temperatures. He was transferred to Eglin Field for the construction of the facility. He had risen to the rank of colonel by the war&#x27;s end in 1945.

==Post war==
McKinley transferred from the Army to the newly created United States Air Force in 1947. He served in Korea in 1951 during the Korean War with the rank of colonel.

==Retirement==
After retiring from the Air Force as a colonel on June 30, 1956, McKinley worked as a civilian consultant to Admiral Richard Byrd.

In 1959 he became a member of the Florida Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

Colonel McKinley died in Florida and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In June 1971, the McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base was named in his honor.

<doc id="1036598" wikidata="Q5128160" url="?curid=1036598" title="Classic Gold GEM">
<text>Solid Gold GEM AM (later Classic Gold GEM-AM) was an Independent Local Radio station, broadcasting to much of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Rutland and East Staffordshire from studios in Nottingham, and later Dunstable, Bedfordshire.

The station ran as Solid Gold GEM AM until the mid-1990s when it was absorbed into the rest of the Classic Gold network, and was replaced on 3 August 2007 by a new network called simply Gold. The result of the merger of the Classic Gold and Capital Gold networks under one owner, GCap Media. The GEM name has since re-emerged with the launch of the internet station Solid Gold Gem AM in 2012.

==History==

The station began as GEM-AM in 1988 (the letters GEM standing for Great East Midlands). It was one of the most well-regarded gold-formatted stations to come to the British airwaves in the late 1980s and was launched as a response to government disapproval of the simulcasting of radio companies&#x27; FM programming on their mediumwave frequencies. GEM was the offshoot of Radio Trent, which began to cater for a younger audience and became known as &quot;Trent FM&quot; upon the frequency split, and the new AM service was launched to much fanfare with a team of Olympic style runners completing a marathon from Leicester to Derby and finally to Nottingham (the three main areas to which GEM was to broadcast).

GEM&#x27;s medium wave broadcasts to Nottinghamshire on 999 kHz and Derbyshire on 945 kHz were initially supplemented by transmissions on 1260 kHz to Leicestershire, but in 1992 this last frequency was given over to programming for Leicester&#x27;s large Asian population (Sunrise Radio, later Sabras Radio).

In 1994 GEM&#x27;s owners Midland Radio plc were bought, by expanding radio company GWR, which gradually networked the station&#x27;s programming with that of other gold stations it had purchased elsewhere in the country. The station was subtly rebranded &quot;Classic Gold GEM&quot; and over time, it became more &quot;Classic Gold&quot; and less &quot;GEM&quot;, until only four hours of local programming was left.

By the end of the 1990s, Classic Gold GEM and GWR&#x27;s network of other medium wave &quot;Classic Gold&quot; stations across the country were sold to media company UBC, in order for GWR to comply with government rules of the time, restricting how much share of listening one company could own. This and the other stations in the group became known as Classic Gold Digital Network.

Former Radio 1 presenter Tony Blackburn co-presented a national breakfast show on the network until 2007.

==Presentation==

Presenters on the station included some who were already established personalities in the East Midlands region. Among them were John Peters (who launched the station as he had done with Trent in 1975). In the late 1980s a new South Asian programme hosted by DJ Magnam brought extra listenership to GEM-AM from the large South Asian community that lived in Derby and Nottingham. A number of the original presenters were later to be heard on a newer oldies and easy listening station broadcasting to the East Midlands, this time on Saga 106.6 FM, which came on air in 2003, and was later rebranded as 106.6 Smooth Radio after it was acquired by GMG Radio. Many of Saga 106.6 FM&#x27;s jingles were made by JAM Creative Productions of Dallas, Texas, and Steve England, and made reference to the Great East Midlands. Classic Gold GEM used ident jingles from Manchester company Alfasound, and then PAMS and JAM.

==GCap Media and Global Radio==

In summer 2007, when ownership restrictions were relaxed, Classic Gold&#x27;s original owners, now called GCap Media after a merger, bought the network of stations back from UBC Media Group.

Having two gold networks on its hands, GCap decided to merge them. In early August 2007, the Classic Gold and Capital Gold networks were joined under the new name Gold, and local output declined further.

The station had a 4% audience reach in Nottingham, and 6% in Derby in 2006. In 1993 the reach was 24% in Nottingham, 23% in Derby. (*RAJAR ratings 1993/2006)

The dwindling audience tuning into the station&#x27;s medium wave frequencies has in recent years been supplemented by those listening to a stream on the internet, and also on DAB Digital Radio in Nottingham and Leicester. The bit rate for this broadcast was reduced in 2006 to accommodate more radio stations to the digital multiplex, but was later increased back to stereo.

After nineteen years broadcasting from the basement &#x27;Studio B&#x27; at Radio Trent&#x27;s Castle Gate headquarters, Classic Gold&#x27;s Nottingham studios moved, along with Trent&#x27;s, to the sixth floor of Chapel Quarter, an office building on the corner of Mount Street and Chapel Bar, in January 2007.

==Solid Gold Gem AM==
On 4 November 2012, the internet radio station Solid Gold Gem AM was launched following the original GEM-AM format. While Solid Gold Gem AM had no connection to the original GEM AM in Nottingham, its line-up featured many of the original presenters including Andy Marriott, Krissi Carpenter, Paul Burbank, Craig Strong, Tim Rogers and Len Groat who was Head of Programmes and Music at the original GEM-AM from 1988 to 1994. A commercial free station, it styles itself as &quot;radio like it used to be&quot;. On 27 November 2014, and shortly after the station had celebrated its second anniversary, it was announced that Solid Gold Gem would cease broadcasting from midnight on 30 November. However, a week after its closure, a relaunch was announced for 15 December. The station would also now be managed by Len Groat, and a second station, Serenade Radio, was launched in February 2015. No reason was given for the broadcasting hiatus.

The station has now rebranded to Solid Gold Gem and it broadcasts 24 hours a day without advertising.

<doc id="1036601" wikidata="Q709280" url="?curid=1036601" title="Arthur Streeton">
<text>Sir Arthur Ernest Streeton (8 April 1867 – 1 September 1943) was an Australian landscape painter and a leading member of the Heidelberg School, also known as Australian Impressionism.

==Early life==
Streeton was born in Mount Moriac, Victoria, south-west of Geelong, on 8 April 1867, the fourth child of Charles Henry and Mary (née Johnson) Streeton. His family moved to the Melbourne suburb of Richmond in 1874. His parents were English migrants who had met on their voyage to Australia in 1854. In 1882, Streeton commenced art studies with George Folingsby at the National Gallery School.

In 1885, Streeton exhibited works for the first time with the Victorian Academy of Art. He found employment as an apprentice lithographer under Charles Troedel.

==Career==

During the summer of 1886–87, Streeton, aged nineteen, first befriended Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin while painting &quot;en plein air&quot; at Mentone Beach. The pair greatly admired Streeton&#x27;s work and invited him to join them at artists&#x27; camps they had established in both Mentone and Box Hill. They were later joined by Charles Conder, beginning a two-year period of close creative companionship, and forming the core group of what became known as the Heidelberg School movement, later also called Australian impressionism. Streeton&#x27;s work rapidly improved during this period, and by 1888 he was widely considered one of Victoria&#x27;s most gifted young painters.
Streeton was exhibiting and perhaps painting in the studio of his friend Roberts at Grosvenor Chambers, Collins Street by May 1888.

===Eaglemont camp, Heidelberg===

In the summer drought of 1888, Streeton travelled by train to the attractive agricultural and grazing suburb of Heidelberg, 11 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s city centre. He intended to walk the remaining distance to the site where Louis Buvelot painted his 1866 work &quot;Summer afternoon near Templestowe&quot;, which Streeton considered &quot;the first fine landscape painted in Victoria&quot;. On the return journey to Heidelberg, wet canvas in hand, Streeton met Charles Davies, brother-in-law of friend and fellow &quot;plein air&quot; painter David Davies. Charles gave him &quot;artistic possession&quot; of an abandoned homestead atop the summit of Mount Eagle estate, offering spectacular views across the Yarra Valley to the Dandenongs. For Streeton, Eaglemont (as it became known) was the ideal working environment—a reasonably isolated rural location accessible by public transport. The house itself could be seen by visitors as they arrived at Heidelberg railway station.
Streeton spent the first few nights at Eaglemont alone with the estate&#x27;s tenant farmer Jack Whelan (who appears in Streeton&#x27;s &quot;pioneer&quot; painting &quot;The selector&#x27;s hut (Whelan on the log)&quot;, 1890), and slept upon the floor, the rooms being bare of furniture. Of his first few nights at the house, Streeton said it was &quot;creaking and ghostly. A long dark corridor seemed full of past visions, and out of doors a blurred rich blackness against the sharp brilliance of the Southern Cross ... But tobacco and wine weighed healthily against the darkness&quot;. He descended the hill daily to Heidelberg village for meals before jaunting into the bush with a billycan of milk and swag of paints and canvases. The first artists to paint with Streeton at Eaglemont were the National Gallery students Aby Altson and John Llewellyn Jones, followed by John Mather and Walter Withers. Like Streeton, Withers painted from nature amidst suburban bush around Melbourne, employing earthy colours with loose, impressionistic brushstrokes. By the end of 1888, he became a weekend visitor to the camp.

About the same time, Streeton met the artist Charles Conder, who travelled down from Sydney in October 1888 at the invitation of Tom Roberts. One year Streeton&#x27;s junior, Conder was already a committed &quot;plein airist&quot;, having been influenced by the painterly techniques of expatriate impressionist Girolamo Nerli. Conder and Roberts joined Streeton at Eaglemont in January 1889 and helped make some modest improvements to the house. Despite austere living conditions, Streeton felt content: &quot;Surrounded by the loveliness of the new landscape, with heat, drought, and flies, and hard pressed for the necessaries of life, we worked hard, and were a happy trio.&quot; Streeton and Conder quickly became friends and influenced one another&#x27;s art. Their shared love of South Australian poet Adam Lindsay Gordon&#x27;s lyrical verse is revealed in the titles of some of their Eaglemont paintings, including Streeton&#x27;s romantic gloaming work &quot;″Above us the great grave sky″&quot; (1890, taken from Gordon&#x27;s poem &quot;Doubtful Dreams&quot;). Later, critics would describe some of the pair&#x27;s Eaglemont paintings as companion pieces, as both artists often painted the same views and subjects using a high-keyed &quot;gold and blue&quot; palette, which Streeton considered &quot;nature&#x27;s scheme of colour in Australia&quot;.

Two of Streeton&#x27;s best-known works were painted during this period—&quot;Golden Summer, Eaglemont&quot; (1889) and &quot;″Still glides the stream, and shall for ever glide″&quot; (1890)—each a sunlit pastoral scene of golden-paddocked plains stretching to the distant blue Corhanwarrabul. In 1891, Arthur Merric and Emma Minnie of the Boyd artistic dynasty took &quot;Golden Summer, Eaglemont&quot; to Europe where it became the first painting by an Australian-born artist to be exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, and was awarded a &quot;Mention honourable&quot; at the 1892 Paris Salon.

===Sydney and travels inland===
On 2 June 1890, in the wake of an economic depression in Melbourne, Streeton sailed to Sydney, and initially stayed there with his sister in the suburb of Summer Hill. He soon relocated to Curlew Camp, a &quot;plein air&quot; artists&#x27; camp on Sydney Harbour, where he painted many views of his natural surroundings and was visited by a number of artists, including Julian Ashton and Albert Henry Fullwood, who stayed at the camp for extended periods. Tom Roberts later joined him also, continuing their artistic friendship. From 1891, Streeton began travelling widely in rural New South Wales. As well as painting scenes of Sydney Harbour and Coogee, and urban scenes of Sydney, it was during the early to mid-1890s that he painted some of his major rural landscapes, including the &quot;Hawkesbury River&quot; series and &#x27;&quot;Fire&#x27;s on&quot;&#x27;.

Sydney Harbour inspired many of Streeton&#x27;s most poetic Symbolist paintings, a number of which infuse the Australian landscape with mythological subjects. The city also spurred his interest in the decorative arts as he painted on fans, furniture, musical instruments and other objects. The influence of Japanese art, such as &quot;kakemono&quot; (hung scrolls), is evidenced in the extreme vertical formats and compositional elements he favoured around this time.

In 1893, Streeton wrote in Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; criticising a proposal by a mining company to develop a colliery on the shores of Sydney Harbor, which would necessitate the cutting down of a great many gum trees. His letter, which came to be known as &quot;Streeton&#x27;s shriek&quot;, read in part:
The letter helped raise public alarm over the proposal, and in 1895, Streeton painted &quot;Cremorne pastoral&quot;, his largest harbour composition, as &quot;an elegiac image of what [he] believed would be lost&quot; if the project went head. When it went on exhibition later that year, the Art Gallery of New South Wales acquired the work and publicly endorsed Streeton&#x27;s protests. The government, in the face of mounting backlash, was forced to abandon the mining project. &quot;Cremorne pastoral&quot;&#x27;s status as an environmental protest painting is considered groundbreaking in Australian art history.

===Overseas and life in England===

In 1897 Streeton sailed for London on the &quot;Polynesian&quot;, stopping at Port Said before continuing on via Cairo and Naples. He held an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1900 and became a member of the Chelsea Arts Club in 1903. Although he had developed a considerable reputation in Australia, he failed to achieve the same success in England. His trips to London were financed by the sales of his paintings at home in Australia.

His time in England reinforced a strong sense of patriotism towards the British Empire and, like many, anticipated the coming war with Germany with some enthusiasm. In 1906, Streeton returned to Australia and completed some paintings at Mount Macedon in February 1907 while staying with his patrons the Pinschofs at Hohe Warte. These included the notable five feet by three feet Australia Felix (a view from Mt. Toorong) and a number of other smaller paintings. 

Streeton returned to London in October. He married Esther Leonora Clench, a Canadian violinist, in 1908 and paintings done during their honeymoon in Venice in September that year, including &quot;The Grand Canal&quot;, were exhibited in Australia in July 1909 as &quot;Arthur Streeton&#x27;s Venice&quot;. In Australia again in April 1914 he held exhibitions in Sydney and Melbourne and went back to England in early 1915.

===War artist===

Along with other members of the Chelsea Arts Club, including Tom Roberts, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (British Army) at the age of 48. He worked at the 3rd London General Hospital in Wandsworth and reached the rank of corporal.
Streeton was made an Australian Official War Artist with the Australian Imperial Force, holding the rank of Honorary Lieutenant, and he travelled to France on 14 May 1918 and was attached to the 2nd Division, receiving his movement order on 8 May 1918. He worked in France, with a break in August, until October 1918. Expected by the Commonwealth to produce sketches and drawings that were &quot;descriptive&quot;, Streeton concentrated on the landscape of the scenes of war and did not attempt to convey the human suffering. Unlike more famous military artists who depicted the definitive moments of battle, Streeton produced &quot;military still life&quot;, capturing the everyday moments of the war. Streeton explained what was at that time an unconventional point of view – a perspective which was based in experience:

Two paintings from this period, &quot;Villers Bretonneux&quot; (1918) and &quot;Boulogne&quot; (1918), are in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

===Later years===
After the war, Streeton resumed painting in the Grampians and Dandenong Ranges. Streeton built a house on five acres (20,000m2) at Olinda in the Dandenongs where he continued to paint, though in 1936 he complained that it &#x27;tends to interfere with the gardening,&#x27; and only produced art for &#x27;a couple of months in the year,&#x27; though he was then preparing a Sydney exhibition in time for his 70th birthday. 

Streeton won the Wynne Prize in 1928 with &quot;Afternoon Light, Goulburn Valley&quot;. He was an art critic for &quot;The Argus&quot; from 1929 to 1935 and in 1937 was knighted for services to the arts. 

Streeton died in September 1943 and is buried at Ferntree Gully cemetery.

==Legacy==

Streeton Drive, a main thoroughfare in Weston Creek is named after Sir Arthur, as is Streeton Primary School, in the Melbourne suburb of Yallambie.

There is also a memorial for Streeton just outside Geelong, Victoria.

In 2008, three expatriate Australian classical musicians living in Geneva, Switzerland founded a piano trio they named the Streeton Trio after the painter.

Streeton&#x27;s works appear in many major Australian galleries and museums, including the National Gallery of Australia and state galleries, and the Australian War Memorial. In September 2015, Streeton&#x27;s Coogee clifftop landscape &quot;Blue Pacific&quot; (1890) became the first painting by an Australian artist, and only the second painting by a Western artist outside Europe, to hang in the permanent collection of the National Gallery, London. It sits alongside major impressionist works by Claude Monet and Édouard Manet.

== Prices ==

Streeton&#x27;s paintings are amongst the most collectible of Australian artists and attracted high prices during his lifetime. &quot;Golden Summer, Eaglemont&quot; sold for around 1000 guineas in 1924 and in 1995 it was bought in a private sale by the National Gallery of Australia for A$3.5 million, both times setting a sales record for an Australian painting. In 1985, &quot;Settler&#x27;s Camp&quot; sold at auction for A$800,000 and this remained the record auction price for Streeton&#x27;s work until 23 May 2005, when his 1890 painting, &quot;Sunlight Sweet, Coogee&quot;, was sold for A$2.04 million (A$1.853 million before tax), becoming only the second painting by an Australian artist to exceed the A$2 million mark at auction (after Frederick McCubbin&#x27;s 1892 work &quot;Bush Idyll&quot;, which sold for A$2.3 million in 1998). The painting was part of the Foster&#x27;s Group collection and was sold at auction by Sotheby&#x27;s. That record was eclipsed when, on 21 April 2021, Streeton&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Canal&quot; (1908) was auctioned in Melbourne for A$3.068 million.

<text>Sir Oliver Napier (11 July 1935 – 2 July 2011) was the first leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. In 1974 he served as the first and only Legal Minister and head of the Office of Legal Reform in the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive set up by the Sunningdale Agreement.

==Early life==
Napier was educated at St. Malachy&#x27;s College, Belfast and the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast before starting work as a solicitor.

==Political career==
Napier joined the Ulster Liberal Party, rising to become vice president by 1969. That year, he led a group of four party members who joined the New Ulster Movement, accepting the post of joint chairman of its political committee. The Liberal Party promptly expelled him, but, working with Bob Cooper, he used his position to establish a new political party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, which sought to become a political force that could command support from across the divided communities of the province, but remaining pro-union. This aimed to offer an alternative to what Napier described as the sectarianism of the Ulster Unionist Party. Despite his faith he was a supporter of the Union.

He served as the party&#x27;s joint leader from 1970 until 1972, then as its sole leader from 1973 to 1984. Under his leadership Alliance participated in successive assemblies that sought to solve the debate on the province&#x27;s position, including the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973 in which Napier was a minister in the power-sharing Executive. In 1979 he came closer to winning a seat in the Westminster Parliament than any other Alliance candidate up to that point when he was less than a thousand votes behind Peter Robinson&#x27;s winning total in Belfast East in a tight three-way marginal. This record was beaten in 2010, when Naomi Long ousted Robinson from the same seat. When Napier stepped down as leader in 1984 he received many plaudits for his work. The following year he was knighted and in 1989 he stood down from Belfast City Council, seemingly to retire.

However, in 1995 he returned to the political fray when he contested the North Down by-election for the Alliance, standing again in the 1997 general election.

In 1996 he was elected to the Northern Ireland Peace Forum for North Down.

Prior to his death Oliver Napier was the last prominent member of the Ulster Liberal Party.

==Public positions==
Napier served on the board of governors of the first integrated school in Northern Ireland, Lagan College.

<text>Seaforth Dock (also known as the Royal Seaforth Dock) is a purpose-built dock and container terminal, on the River Mersey, England, at Seaforth, to the north of Liverpool. As part of the Port of Liverpool and Liverpool Freeport, it is operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. Situated at the northern end of the dock system, it is connected to Gladstone Dock to the south, which via its lock entrance provides maritime access to Seaforth Dock from the river.

Despite planning permission having been obtained almost sixty years previously, work commenced during the 1960s on Liverpool&#x27;s largest dock facility. In part the work was intended to reconstruct or compensate for damage suffered during World War II. The dock was the largest built in the United Kingdom for some time, with of quay and a depth of and world&#x27;s largest lock gates.

Opened in 1971, the site consists of about , of which is water. Technological changes, such as containerization, caused the loss of numerous jobs on the docks. In the 21st century, the dock handles mainly containers, oils, timber, fruit and vegetables, grain and animal feed. The dock became a free port in 1984.

A fruit and vegetable terminal opened at the dock in 2008. The terminal primarily received produce from Spain. However, this facility closed in 2013.

== Wind turbines ==
In 1999, Peel Energy installed six Vestas V44-600 kW wind turbines along the river wall for a total nameplate capacity of 3.6MW. 

== Rail connection ==
Seaforth Dock is served by one rail line, the Canada Dock branch line. The Olive Mount rail chord at Edge Hill junction was re-opened early 2009 to increase the throughput of the service to Seaforth Dock, giving direct access for freight from the Port of Liverpool to the West Coast Main Line. In May 2016 it was announced that the line&#x27;s final section into the dock estate would be upgraded to double track from single track to increase capacity to the port. Combined with improved signalling at Earlestown, the improvements will enable up to 48 trains a day to enter the port. Work on the line is expected to be completed by 2019.

==Liverpool2==
Liverpool2 is a Post-Panamax container terminal extension which opened in November 2016 as an expansion to Seaforth dock.

<text>Maurice Henry Hewlett (1861 – 15 June 1923) was an English historical novelist, poet and essayist.

==Biography==
He was born at Weybridge, the eldest son of Henry Gay Hewlett, of Shaw Hall, Addington, Kent. He was educated at the London International College, Spring Grove, Isleworth, and was called to the bar in 1891. He gave up the law after the success of &quot;The Forest Lovers&quot;. From 1896 to 1901 he was Keeper of Lands, Revenues, Records and Enrolments, a government post as adviser on matters of medieval law.

Hewlett married Hilda Beatrice Herbert on 3 January 1888 in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Vauxhall, where her father was the incumbent vicar. The couple had two children, a daughter, Pia, and a son, Francis, but separated in 1914, partly due to Hilda&#x27;s increasing interest in aviation. In 1911, Hilda had become the first woman in the UK to gain a pilot&#x27;s licence.

He settled at Broad Chalke, Wiltshire. His friends included Evelyn Underhill, and Ezra Pound, whom he met at the Poets&#x27; Club in London. He was also a friend of J. M. Barrie, who named one of the pirates in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; &quot;Cecco&quot; after Hewlett&#x27;s son.

Hewlett&#x27;s 1900 novel &quot;The Life and Death of Richard Yea-and-Nay&quot;, about Richard the Lionheart, was a favourite novel of T. E. Lawrence. Lawrence said he had read &quot;The Life and Death of Richard Yea-and-Nay&quot; several times. Another of Hewlett&#x27;s historical novels was &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Quair&quot; (1904), about Mary, Queen of Scots. &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Quair&quot; was cited as an influence by Ford Madox Ford, who said that &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Quair&quot; &quot;taught me a good deal&quot;. Hewlett also wrote six novels based on the Icelandic Family sagas, these include &quot;The Light Heart&quot; and &quot;Thorgils of Treadholt&quot;. Hewlett also wrote &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (based on &quot;Gisli&#x27;s Saga&quot;), &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Tale&quot; (based on &quot;Kormak&#x27;s Saga&quot;), &quot;Frey and His Wife&quot; (based on Ogmund Dytt&#x27;s tale), and &quot;Gudred the Fair&quot; (based on the &quot;Greenland sagas&quot;).

Hewlett was parodied by Max Beerbohm in &quot;A Christmas Garland&quot; in the part titled &quot;Fond Hearts Askew&quot;.

Hewlett&#x27;s brother Henry William Hewlett was also a published novelist, writing under the name William Hewlett.

Maurice Hewlett died in London on 15 June 1923 at age 62.

<text>Fifth grade (also 5th Grade or Grade 5) is the fifth or sixth year of formal or compulsory education. In the United States, this is mostly the last grade of primary school, but for some states, it could be the first year of middle school. Primary school generally goes from Kindergarten and ends in fifth or sixth grade. Students in fifth grade are usually 10–11 years old. In different countries they have different names for fifth grade. The list of different versions are below depending on the country:

== United Kingdom ==
In England and Wales, the equivalent is Year 6. 

In Scotland, 10–11 year olds are in primary school P7.

== Ireland ==
In Ireland, the equivalent is 5th class.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the equivalent is Year 5, which children generally start between the ages of ten and eleven. It is the second last year of primary school and the 6th year of school overall. 

== Philippines ==
In the Philippines, the equivalent is Grade 5, and students can also start at the age of 9.

== United States ==
People in the USA (United States of America) go through the 6th year of school. In the USA, grade 5 is known as 5th grade, potentially the last year of elementary school or the first year of middle school.

In the United States, 41 states have implemented Common Core standards for 5th-grade curriculum in the English language and srts/mathematics.

Key English Language Arts Common Core standards for 5th grade students include:

* Ability to determine the theme of a book, story, or poem from details in the text
* Compare and contrast two or more characters, settings, or events in a story
* Describe how the narrator or speaker&#x27;s point of view may influence how events are described
* Compare and contrast stories in the same genre.

Key Mathematics Common Core standards for 5th grade students include:

* Write and interpret numerical expressions in operations and algebraic thinking
* Ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions
* Convert like measurement units
* Understand volume as an attribute of 3-dimensional space
* Graph points on the coordinate plane
* Classify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their properties

<text>Woland () is a fictional character in the novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; by the Russian (Soviet) author Mikhail Bulgakov, written between 1928 and 1940. Woland is the mysterious foreigner and professor whose visit to Moscow sets the plot rolling and turns the world upside-down.

His demonic entourage, which includes witches, succubi, and a gigantic talking cat, his role in the plot, and the fact that &quot;Voland&quot; is a (now outdated) German word for a devil or evil spirit, all imply that he is, in fact, the Devil. More controversial interpretations see him as the Apostle Peter (based on Jesus’ remark to Peter, &quot;Get thee behind me, Satan&quot;) or even the Second Coming of Christ.

Edward Ericson argues that Woland is essentially &quot;the Satan of orthodox (specifically Russian Orthodox) Christian theology [...] He is both a tempter of men and an unwitting instrument of divine justice, a being who owes his existence and power to the very one he opposes.&quot;

In conceiving of Woland, Bulgakov draws heavily from the figure of Mephistopheles in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, a connection made explicit by the use of an epigraph from the poem at the beginning of the novel. Additionally, the name Woland itself is derived from a name by which Mephistopheles refers to himself during the Walpurgisnacht scene: squire Voland (). Other allusions to Goethe&#x27;s Mephistopheles include Woland&#x27;s cane with the head of a poodle and his limp. Another influence on Woland is Charles Gounod&#x27;s opera &quot;Faust&quot;.

==In adaptations==
*Veniamin Smekhov played him in a Moscow stage adaptation.
*In the 1972 Italian-Yugoslavian adaptation, &quot;Il maestro e Margherita&quot;, Woland was played by French actor Alain Cuny.
*In the 1990 Polish TV series, &quot;Mistrz i Malgorzata&quot;, Woland was played by Gustaw Holoubek.
*In the 1994 Russian film adaptation, Woland was played by Valentin Gaft.
*In the 2005 Russian miniseries adaptation, Woland was played by Oleg Basilashvili.
*In the 2024 Russian film adaptation, Woland was played by August Diehl.

<doc id="1036642" wikidata="Q158701" url="?curid=1036642" title=".22 short">
<text>.22 short is a variety of .22 caliber rimfire ammunition. Developed in 1857 for the first Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, the .22 rimfire was the first American metallic cartridge. The original loading was a bullet and of black powder. The original .22 rimfire cartridge was renamed .22 short with the introduction of the .22 long in 1871.

Developed for self defense, the modern .22 short, though still used in a few pocket pistols and mini-revolvers, is mainly used as a quiet round for practice by the recreational shooter. The .22 short was popularly used in shooting galleries at fairs and arcades; several rifle makers produced &quot;gallery&quot; models for .22 short exclusively. Due to its low recoil and good inherent accuracy, the .22 short was used for the Olympic 25 meter rapid fire pistol event until 2004, and they were allowed in the shooting part of modern pentathlon competitions before they switched to air pistols.

Several makes of starter pistols use .22 short blank cartridges. Some powder-actuated nail guns use .22 short blanks as a power source.

==Overview==
Most .22 short bullets are made of lead (usually coated with grease or wax, or copper) in round nose or hollow point styles. Bullets for use at shooting galleries were often made of compressed powdered metal that disintegrated on impact to avoid ricochets and over-penetration of backstops. The standard velocity .22 short launches a bullet at with 70 ft·lbf (95 J) of energy from a 22 in (559 mm) rifle barrel and can penetrate of soft pine.

As a hunting round, the high velocity hollow point Short is useful only for small game such as tree squirrels and rabbits. For small game hunting in general, the greater energy and wider ammunition selection of the .22 long rifle make it a more popular choice. In the American South, the .22 short hollow point is still very popular for use on raccoons, which are treed at night using dogs and shooting is at close range. In some states, the .22 short is the only legal round to use for such hunting.

Although the .22 long rifle has surpassed the .22 short in the marketplace, many ammunition companies still produce .22 shorts, and in a fairly wide variety. Most makers utilize the standard solid round nose bullet and hollow point bullet weights for the .22 short. Several types are made by CCI: a CB Short at , target Shorts at , their standard Short round with plated round nose bullet at , and a high speed hunting load with plated hollow point bullet at . The .22 short high-velocity exceeds the performance of the .22 long (with the exception of CCI&#x27;s High Velocity 1217fps long loading), and the .22 short has displaced the .22 long as an alternate to the .22 long rifle for many .22 shooters. Fiocchi makes their Exacta Compensated Super Match SM200 with lead round nose at . Remington produces a high velocity plated round nose at . Aguila makes both a match lead round nose at , and a &quot;high speed&quot; round with plated bullet also listed at . Also available is the RWS R25 match ammunition at . Eley also makes their rapid fire match cartridge at .

Most of the target oriented and CB Shorts are very quiet, due to being subsonic. When fired from a full-length rifle barrel, most .22 short loadings are as quiet as if not quieter than, the average air rifle.

The Aguila SubSonic Sniper round uses a .22 short case with a bullet (twice the weight of the .22 short bullet and 50% heavier than a .22 long rifle bullet) giving an overall length of a .22 long rifle round, making categorizing the SSS problematic: while the SSS case size is .22 short, the firing chamber of the barrel must be .22 LR dimensions to accept the SSS cartridge.

===.22 short-caliber rifles===
There have been many rifles chambered for the .22 short over the years, but only several lever action rifles are currently chambered for this round, notably Henry Repeating Arms and Marlin Firearms Co. lever action rifles. The Marlin Golden 39A model represents the oldest and longest continuously produced shoulder firearm in the world. Many rifles in .22 short were made between 1901 and 1940, mostly intended for gallery shooting and small game hunting. Remington and Winchester produced the most rifles in .22 short. Remington has made their Model 24 and Model 241 &quot;Speedmaster&quot; semi-autos as well as their Model 12 and 121 &quot;Fieldmaster&quot; pump actions in .22 short. Remington&#x27;s Nylon 66 GS Gallery Special (1962 to 1981) was one of the last .22 short-only rifles made especially for shooting gallery use. Winchester produced a variety of different rifles in .22 short, including the 1873 lever action, 1885 single shot (in both low wall and high wall variations), Model 1890, 1906 and 62A pump actions, Model 74 semi-auto, and Model 61 pump action. Many of their bolt-action rifles were available on a special-order basis in .22 short. Browning/FN also produced their takedown semi-auto in .22 short, on the same John Browning design upon which the Remington Model 24 is based.

Many of these rifles are now collectors’ items, particularly the Winchesters, and demand a premium in price over the same rifle chambered in .22 long rifle.

Many rifles marked &quot;.22 short, long and long rifle&quot; (or &quot;.22 S, L, LR&quot;) will not shoot shorts with the same accuracy as they will a long rifle round nor as accurately as a rifle designed for .22 short. This is due to the excess chamber length needed to allow chambering of .22 LR cartridges. This requires the bullet from a .22 short to travel a short distance before it engages the rifling, which is detrimental to accuracy. In addition, barrels made for .22 short are rifled with a rate of twist of one turn in twenty inches, while barrels made for .22 long rifle have a twist of one turn in sixteen inches.

<text>The .22 long is a variety of .22 caliber (5.6 mm) rimfire ammunition. The .22 long is the second-oldest of the surviving rimfire cartridges, dating back to 1871, when it was loaded with a bullet and of black powder, 25% more than the .22 short on which it was based. It was designed for use in revolvers, but was soon chambered in rifles as well, in which it gained a reputation as a small game cartridge.

In 1887, the .22 long case was combined with the heavier bullet of the .22 extra long of 1880 to produce the .22 long rifle, giving a longer overall length and a higher muzzle energy. Many firearms designed for the .22 long rifle will chamber and fire the shorter round, though the .22 long generally does not generate sufficient energy to operate semi-automatic guns. The one prominent survivor of the .22 long is the .22 CB long, a long-cased version of the .22 CB.

The original .22 long loading used the same powder charge as the .22 long rifle, .22 long bullet was significantly lighter, but it did not result in higher velocities for the .22 long when fired from a rifle. The large barrel volume to chamber volume ratio of a .22 rimfire rifle means that the powder gasses have expanded as far as they can before the bullet reaches the muzzle of a normal-length rifle barrel, and the light .22 long bullet has less inertia than the .22 long rifle. The quieter report and lower penetration of the .22 long cartridge were often seen as desirable qualities.

The .22 long rifle performs as well in a short handgun barrel as the .22 long, and outperforms it in a long rifle barrel.

Modern Hypervelocity loadings of the .22 long rifle use bullets as light as , and modern blends of powder to generate velocities higher than normal loads, and chamber pressures high enough to cycle semi-automatic firearms reliably. The most well known of these is the CCI Stinger, which goes so far as to stretch the case length slightly. The overall length is still within the max overall length for the .22 long rifle.

The .22 long is still produced even after the change over to smokeless powders. CCI currently loads a high-velocity .22 long with a muzzle velocity of and a muzzle energy of

<text>Edith Massey (born Edith Y. Dornfeld; May 28, 1918 – October 24, 1984) was an American actress and singer. Massey was best known for her appearances in a series of movies by director John Waters. She was one of the Dreamlanders, Waters&#x27;s stable of regular cast and crew members.

== Early life ==
Born as Edith Dornfeld on May 28, 1918, in New York City, she was the daughter of Bessie (née Lansnek, 1896–1925) and Samuel Dornfeld (1891–1918), an Austrian-born Jewish couple. Samuel, who was a World War I veteran, died five months after Massey&#x27;s birth due to complications as a result from a gas attack during the war.

The 1920 United States Federal Census recorded Edith, age one, living on Lewis Street in Manhattan, New York, with her three-year-old sister, Etta, and their widowed mother, Bessie, who was 22 years old. The following year, on March 9, 1921, Bessie married her second husband, Max Grodsky, in Denver, Colorado.

According to Massey&#x27;s half-brother, Morris Grodsky, their parents &quot;just threw up their hands one day, dropped off those who couldn&#x27;t fend for themselves at a local orphanage or &#x27;home,&#x27; and disappeared&quot;. According to Grodsky, who was also left there, the Jewish orphanage was not a terrible place, though he remembered being always hungry. Massey&#x27;s mother died March 1, 1925.

In the 1975 documentary &quot;Love Letter to Edie&quot;, Massey said she was raised in an orphanage and eventually was placed in a foster home. Her foster family members were cruel to her and, as a teenager, she ran away to Hollywood. In the documentary &quot;Divine Waters&quot; (1981), Massey explained that she was &quot;born in New York, but raised in Denver...I was movie crazy, so I went to California to try and get in the movies, but instead I became a barmaid.&quot;

While in Los Angeles, California, she married soldier Findley Eli Stitson on November 26, 1938, leaving him about five years later because she got &quot;restless&quot;. However, in &quot;Divine Waters&quot;, Massey said that the marriage lasted &quot;about seven years. It was my fault; I left him for another man, so I blame myself for it.&quot;

She worked in several odd jobs through the years, and she eventually relocated to Baltimore, Maryland where she worked as a barmaid at Pete&#x27;s Hotel in the Fell&#x27;s Point neighborhood. Filmmaker John Waters met Massey while she was working at Pete&#x27;s Hotel in 1969 and offered her a role as herself in the film &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;. In the early 1970s, she quit her job at Pete&#x27;s and opened a thrift store called Edith&#x27;s Shopping Bag, also in Fell&#x27;s Point.

== Collaboration with John Waters ==
Massey gained a cult following from her appearances in five films directed by John Waters: &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; (1970), in which she appeared as herself and, in a dream sequence, as the Virgin Mary; &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (1972), playing Divine&#x27;s egg-loving mother, Edie; &quot;Female Trouble&quot; (1974), as Aunt Ida; &quot;Desperate Living&quot; (1977), as the evil Queen Carlotta of Mortville; and in her final role in a Waters film, &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981), as Cuddles Kovinsky.

== Later career and death ==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Massey capitalized on the infamy of Waters&#x27;s films by touring as the lead singer of a punk band, Edie and the Eggs. She also posed for a series of greeting cards. Later, when the Baltimore winters became too much for her to endure, she moved to Venice, California, where she opened another thrift store with the money she earned from acting in Waters&#x27;s films. In 1980, she was featured in John Mellencamp&#x27;s music video for &quot;This Time&quot; and also appears on the cover of Mellencamp&#x27;s album &quot;Nothin&#x27; Matters and What If It Did&quot;.

In 1982, Massey recorded a cover of The Four Seasons&#x27; &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; that was included on the compilation albums &quot;The Rhino Brothers Present the World&#x27;s Worst Records&quot; and &quot;A Date With John Waters&quot;.

The year she died, Massey starred in her final film, &quot;Mutants in Paradise&quot;. She read for a role in Paul Bartel&#x27;s Western parody &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; (1985) opposite longtime co-star Divine, but actress Nedra Volz was cast instead.

Massey died of complications of lymphoma and diabetes on October 24, 1984, aged 66, in Los Angeles. Her body was cremated, and her ashes were scattered in the Garden of Roses at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
Director Robert Maier made a &quot;mockumentary&quot; short about her in 1975 titled &quot;Love Letter to Edie&quot;. There is a director&#x27;s authorized version re-mastered from his original 16mm color film footage.

<doc id="1036651" wikidata="Q1140255" url="?curid=1036651" title="Input–output model">
<text>In economics, an input–output model is a quantitative economic model that represents the interdependencies between different sectors of a national economy or different regional economies. Wassily Leontief (1906–1999) is credited with developing this type of analysis and earned the Nobel Prize in Economics for his development of this model.

==Origins==
Francois Quesnay had developed a cruder version of this technique called Tableau économique, and Léon Walras&#x27;s work &quot;Elements of Pure Economics&quot; on general equilibrium theory also was a forerunner and made a generalization of Leontief&#x27;s seminal concept.

Alexander Bogdanov has been credited with originating the concept in a report delivered to the All Russia Conference on the Scientific Organisation of Labour and Production Processes, in January 1921. This approach was also developed by Lev Kritzman. Thomas Remington, has argued that their work provided a link between Quesnay&#x27;s tableau économique and the subsequent contributions by Vladimir Groman and Vladimir Bazarov to Gosplan&#x27;s method of material balance planning.

Wassily Leontief&#x27;s work in the input–output model was influenced by the works of the classical economists Karl Marx and Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi. Karl Marx&#x27;s economics provided an early outline involving a set of tables where the economy consisted of two interlinked departments.

Leontief was the first to use a matrix representation of a national (or regional) economy.

== Basic derivation ==
The model depicts inter-industry relationships within an economy, showing how output from one industrial sector may become an input to another industrial sector. In the inter-industry matrix, column entries typically represent inputs to an industrial sector, while row entries represent outputs from a given sector. This format, therefore, shows how dependent each sector is on every other sector, both as a customer of outputs from other sectors and as a supplier of inputs. Sectors may also depend internally on a portion of their own production as delineated by the entries of the matrix diagonal. Each column of the input–output matrix shows the monetary value of inputs to each sector and each row represents the value of each sector&#x27;s outputs.

Say that we have an economy with formula_1 sectors. Each sector produces formula_2 units of a single homogeneous good. Assume that the formula_3th sector, in order to produce 1 unit, must use formula_4 units from sector formula_5. Furthermore, assume that each sector sells some of its output to other sectors (intermediate output) and some of its output to consumers (final output, or final demand). Call final demand in the formula_5th sector formula_7. Then we might write

:formula_8

or total output equals intermediate output plus final output. If we let formula_9 be the matrix of coefficients formula_4, formula_11 be the vector of total output, and formula_12 be the vector of final demand, then our expression for the economy becomes
which after re-writing becomes formula_13. If the matrix formula_14 is invertible then this is a linear system of equations with a unique solution, and so given some final demand vector the required output can be found. Furthermore, if the principal minors of the matrix formula_14 are all positive (known as the Hawkins–Simon condition), the required output vector formula_11 is non-negative.

=== Example ===

Consider an economy with two goods, A and B. The matrix of coefficients and the final demand is given by

:formula_17

Intuitively, this corresponds to finding the amount of output each sector should produce given that we want 7 units of good A and 4 units of good B. Then solving the system of linear equations derived above gives us

:formula_18

=== Further research ===

There is extensive literature on these models. The model has been extended to work with non-linear relationships between sectors. There is the Hawkins–Simon condition on producibility. There has been research on disaggregation to clustered inter-industry flows, and on the study of constellations of industries. A great deal of empirical work has been done to identify coefficients, and data has been published for the national economy as well as for regions. The Leontief system can be extended to a model of general equilibrium; it offers a method of decomposing work done at a macro level.

=== Regional multipliers ===
While national input–output tables are commonly created by countries&#x27; statistics agencies, officially published regional input–output tables are rare. Therefore, economists often use location quotients to create regional multipliers starting from national data. This technique has been criticized because there are several location quotient regionalization techniques, and none are universally superior across all use-cases.

=== Introducing transportation ===

Transportation is implicit in the notion of inter-industry flows. It is explicitly recognized when transportation is identified as an industry – how much is purchased from transportation in order to produce. But this is not very satisfactory because transportation requirements differ, depending on industry locations and capacity constraints on regional production. Also, the receiver of goods generally pays freight cost, and often transportation data are lost because transportation costs are treated as part of the cost of the goods.

Walter Isard and his student, Leon Moses, were quick to see the spatial economy and transportation implications of input–output, and began work in this area in the 1950s developing a concept of interregional input–output. Take a one region versus the world case. We wish to know something about inter-regional commodity flows, so introduce a column into the table headed &quot;exports&quot; and we introduce an &quot;import&quot; row.

A more satisfactory way to proceed would be to tie regions together at the industry level. That is, we could identify both intra-region inter-industry transactions and inter-region inter-industry transactions. The problem here is that the table grows quickly.

Input–output is conceptually simple. Its extension to a model of equilibrium in the national economy has been done successfully using high-quality data. One who wishes to work with input–output systems must deal with industry classification, data estimation, and inverting very large, often ill-conditioned matrices. The quality of the data and matrices of the input-output model can be improved by modelling activities with digital twins and solving the problem of optimizing management decisions. Moreover, changes in relative prices are not readily handled by this modelling approach alone. Input–output accounts are part and parcel to a more flexible form of modelling, computable general equilibrium models.

Two additional difficulties are of interest in transportation work. There is the question of substituting one input for another, and there is the question about the stability of coefficients as production increases or decreases. These are intertwined questions. They have to do with the nature of regional production functions.

===Technology Assumptions===
To construct input-output tables from supply and use tables, four principal assumptions can be applied. The choice depends on whether product-by-product or industry-by-industry input-output tables are to be established.

==Usefulness==

Because the input–output model is fundamentally linear in nature, it lends itself to rapid computation as well as flexibility in computing the effects of changes in demand. Input–output models for different regions can also be linked together to investigate the effects of inter-regional trade, and additional columns can be added to the table to perform environmentally extended input–output analysis (EEIOA). For example, information on fossil fuel inputs to each sector can be used to investigate flows of embodied carbon within and between different economies.

The structure of the input–output model has been incorporated into national accounting in many developed countries, and as such can be used to calculate important measures such as national GDP. Input–output economics has been used to study regional economies within a nation, and as a tool for national and regional economic planning. A main use of input–output analysis is to measure the economic impacts of events as well as public investments or programs as shown by IMPLAN and Regional Input–Output Modeling System. It is also used to identify economically related industry clusters and also so-called &quot;key&quot; or &quot;target&quot; industries (industries that are most likely to enhance the internal coherence of a specified economy). By linking industrial output to satellite accounts articulating energy use, effluent production, space needs, and so on, input–output analysts have extended the approaches application to a wide variety of uses.

===Input–output and socialist planning===
The input–output model is one of the major conceptual models for a socialist planned economy. This model involves the direct determination of physical quantities to be produced in each industry, which are used to formulate a consistent economic plan of resource allocation. This method of planning is contrasted with price-directed Lange-model socialism and Soviet-style material balance planning.

In the economy of the Soviet Union, planning was conducted using the method of material balances up until the country&#x27;s dissolution. The method of material balances was first developed in the 1930s during the Soviet Union&#x27;s rapid industrialization drive. Input–output planning was never adopted because the material balance system had become entrenched in the Soviet economy, and input–output planning was shunned for ideological reasons. As a result, the benefits of consistent and detailed planning through input–output analysis were never realized in the Soviet-type economies.

== Measuring input–output tables ==

The mathematics of input–output economics is straightforward, but the data requirements are enormous because the expenditures and revenues of each branch of economic activity have to be represented. As a result, not all countries collect the required data and data quality varies, even though a set of standards for the data&#x27;s collection has been set out by the United Nations through its System of National Accounts (SNA): the most recent standard is the 2008 SNA. Because the data collection and preparation process for the input–output accounts is necessarily labor and computer intensive, input–output tables are often published long after the year in which the data were collected—typically as much as 5–7 years after. Moreover, the economic &quot;snapshot&quot; that the benchmark version of the tables provides of the economy&#x27;s cross-section is typically taken only once every few years, at best.

However, many developed countries estimate input–output accounts annually and with much greater recency. This is because while most uses of the input–output analysis focus on the matrix set of inter-industry exchanges, the actual focus of the analysis from the perspective of most national statistical agencies is the benchmarking of gross domestic product. Input–output tables therefore are an instrumental part of national accounts. As suggested above, the core input–output table reports only intermediate goods and services that are exchanged among industries. But an array of row vectors, typically aligned at the bottom of this matrix, record non-industrial inputs by industry like payments for labor; indirect business taxes; dividends, interest, and rents; capital consumption allowances (depreciation); other property-type income (like profits); and purchases from foreign suppliers (imports). At a national level, although excluding the imports, when summed this is called &quot;gross product originating&quot; or &quot;gross domestic product by industry.&quot; Another array of column vectors is called &quot;final demand&quot; or &quot;gross product consumed.&quot; This displays columns of spending by households, governments, changes in industry stocks, and industries on investment, as well as net exports. (See also Gross domestic product.) In any case, by employing the results of an economic census which asks for the sales, payrolls, and material/equipment/service input of each establishment, statistical agencies back into estimates of industry-level profits and investments using the input–output matrix as a sort of double-accounting framework.
== Dynamic Extensions ==
===The Leontief IO model with capital formation endogenized ===
The IO model discussed above is static because it does not describe the evolution of the economy over time: it does not include different time periods. 
Dynamic Leontief models are obtained by endogenizing the formation of capital stock over time. 
Denote by formula_19the vector of capital formation, with formula_20 its formula_21th element, and by formula_22 the amount of capital good formula_21 (for example, a blade) used in sector formula_24 ( for example, wind power generation), for investment at time formula_25. We then have 

formula_26

We assume that it takes one year for investment in plant and equipment to become productive capacity. Denoting by formula_27 the stock of formula_21 at the beginning of time formula_25, and by formula_30 the rate of depreciation, we then have:

Here, formula_31 refers to the amount of capital stock that is used up in year formula_25. 
Denote by formula_33 the productive capacity in formula_25, and assume the following proportionalty between formula_27 and formula_33:
The matrix formula_37 is called the capital coefficient matrix. 
From () and (), we obtain the following expression for formula_19: 

formula_39

Assuming that the productive capacity is always fully utilized, we obtain the following expression for () with endogenized capital formation:

formula_40

where formula_41 stands for the items of final demand other than formula_19.

Rearranged, we have

formula_43

wehere formula_44. 

If formula_45 is non-singular, this model could be solved for formula_46 for given formula_47 and formula_48:

formula_49

This is the Leontief dynamic forward-looking model

A caveat to this model is that formula_45 will, in general, be singular, and the above formulation cannot be obtained. 
This is because some products, such as energy items, are not used as capital goods, and the corresponding rows of the matrix formula_45 will be zeros. 
This fact has prompted some researchers to consolidate the sectors until the non-singularity of formula_45 is achieved, at the cost of sector resolution. Apart from this feature, many studies have found that the outcomes obtained for this forward-looking model invariably lead to unrealistic and widely fluctuating results that lack economic interpretation. This has resulted in a gradual decline in interest in the model after the 1970s, although there is a recent increase in interest within the context of disaster analysis.

==Input–output analysis versus consistency analysis==
Despite the clear ability of the input–output model to depict and analyze the dependence of one industry or sector on another, Leontief and others never managed to introduce the full spectrum of dependency relations in a market economy. In 2003, Mohammad Gani, a pupil of Leontief, introduced consistency analysis in his book &quot;Foundations of Economic Science&quot;, which formally looks exactly like the input–output table but explores the dependency relations in terms of payments and intermediation relations. Consistency analysis explores the consistency of plans of buyers and sellers by decomposing the input–output table into four matrices, each for a different kind of means of payment. It integrates micro and macroeconomics into one model and deals with money in a value-free manner. It deals with the flow of funds via the movement of goods.

<doc id="1036654" wikidata="Q60589" url="?curid=1036654" title="Andreas Karlstadt">
<text>Andreas Rudolph Bodenstein von Karlstadt (148624 December 1541), better known as Andreas Karlstadt, Andreas Carlstadt or Karolostadt, in Latin, Carolstadius, or simply as Andreas Bodenstein, was a German Protestant theologian, University of Wittenberg chancellor, a contemporary of Martin Luther and a reformer of the early Reformation.

Karlstadt became a close associate of Martin Luther and one of the earliest Protestant Reformers. After Frederick III, Elector of Saxony concealed Luther at the Wartburg (1521–1522), Karlstadt and Thomas Müntzer started the first iconoclastic movement in Wittenberg and preached theology that was viewed as Anabaptist, but Karlstadt and Müntzer never regarded themselves as Anabaptists.

Karlstadt operated as a church reformer largely in his own right, and after coming in conflict with Luther, he switched his allegiance from the Lutheran to the Reformed camp, and later became a radical reformer before once again returning to the Reformed tradition. First, he served as one of many Lutheran preachers in Wittenberg. He travelled widely, but only within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire, visiting German-speaking, French-speaking and Italian-speaking lands. By the end of his life he had allied himself with Heinrich Bullinger in Switzerland and worked in Basel, where he eventually died. Despite coming closer to the Reformed tradition by the time of his death, Karlstadt maintained his own distinct understanding on many theological issues throughout much of his life.

==Education==

Karlstadt received his doctorate of theology in 1510 from the University of Wittenberg. Previously, Karlstadt had been educated at Erfurt (1499–1503) and in Cologne (1503–1505). Karlstadt obtained his master&#x27;s degree from the newly founded university at Wittenberg in 1505, and received his doctorate from the same university five years later.

In the same year in which Karlstadt received his doctorate he became archdeacon and the chair of the theology department. In 1511 he became chancellor of Wittenberg university. In 1512 he awarded Martin Luther his doctorate. From 1515–16, he studied in Rome, where he obtained the double degree in canon and civil law (utriusque juris) at the Sapienza university.

==Reformation==
Before 1515, Karlstadt was a proponent of a modified scholasticism. He was a &quot;secular&quot; cleric with no official ties to any monastic order. His beliefs were challenged during his stay in Rome, where he alleges he saw large-scale corruption in the Catholic Church, and on a document dated 16 September 1516 he wrote a series of 151 theses. (These should not be confused with Luther&#x27;s 95 theses (1517) that attacked indulgences.)

In 1519, Johann Eck challenged Karlstadt to the Leipzig Debate. There, Eck debated with Luther as well as Karlstadt.

On 15 June 1520 Pope Leo X issued the papal bull &quot;Exsurge Domine&quot; that threatened Luther and Karlstadt with excommunication, and condemned several of their theses. Both reformers remained steadfast, and excommunication followed in 1521 in the papal bull &quot;Decet Romanum Pontificem&quot;.

After the Diet of Worms (January–May, 1521), and while Luther was hiding at Wartburg Castle, Karlstadt worked toward reform in Wittenberg. On Christmas Day 1521, he performed the first &quot;reformed&quot; communion service. 
He did not elevate the elements of communion, wore secular clothing during the service, and purged all references to sacrifice from the traditional Mass. He shouted rather than whispered the words of institution (&quot;This is my body...&quot;, etc.) in German instead of Latin, rejected confession as a prerequisite for communion, and let the communicants take both bread and wine on their own during the Communion.

In January 1522, the Wittenberg city council authorized the removal of imagery from churches and affirmed the changes introduced by Karlstadt on Christmas. Karlstadt wrote his thesis &quot;On the Removal of Images and That There Should Be No Beggars Among Christians&quot; in 1522, shortly after this authorization from the city council.
On 19 January Karlstadt married Anna von Mochau, the fifteen-year-old daughter of a poor nobleman. 
On 20 January the imperial government and the Pope ordered Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony to undo the changes. 
Frederick let most of the Mass revert to its Catholic form, but in a letter to the Wittenberg Council, he noted his personal compassion for Karlstadt.

===Relationship with Luther===
In the first week of March, Luther returned from Wartburg. From 9–16 March Luther gave eight sermons in which he stressed some theological similarities with Karlstadt, but, in hindsight, urged caution. 
This was a major turning point between Karlstadt and Luther. 
Karlstadt reasserted some of his moderately mystical leanings, continued wearing peasants&#x27; clothing, asked to be called &quot;Brother Andreas,&quot; and became disillusioned with academic life. In fact, he renounced his three doctoral degrees, and, according to one source, &quot;gave excellent but infrequent lectures.&quot;

In May 1523, Karlstadt was invited by the church of Orlamünde to be its pastor, and he accepted at once. 
Here he instituted all his radical reforms, and Orlamünde became the model of a congregationalist reformation. Church music and art were set aside, clerical matrimony was preached, and infant baptism was rejected. Perhaps most importantly, in Orlamünde Karlstadt denied the physical but affirmed the spiritual presence of Christ in the communion.

From Spring 1524, Luther started to campaign against Karlstadt, denying his right to publish and preach without Luther&#x27;s authorization. 
In June, Karlstadt resigned as archdeacon. 
In July, Luther published the &quot;Letter to the Saxon Princes&quot;, in which he argued that Thomas Müntzer and Karlstadt agreed, and were both dangerous sectarians with revolutionary tendencies. Karlstadt defended the observance of the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, as a holy day to the Lord. Martin Luther differed from him as he believed that Christians were free to observe any day of the week, provided it was uniform. His defense of the Sabbath, and others among the Anabaptists, caused him to be censured as a Jew and a heretic.

On 22 August 1524, Luther preached in Jena. 
Karlstadt hid in the crowd during Luther’s preaching, and wrote to Luther, asking to see him. 
This led to the well-known confrontation at the Black Bear Inn in a conversation recorded by a Martin Reinhardt and published within a month. 
There was a number of misunderstandings between the two men. 
For example, Luther said that he was convinced that Karlstadt had revolutionary tendencies, despite the fact that Karlstadt had all along rejected violence in the name of religion, and rejected Thomas Müntzer&#x27;s invitation to join the League of the Elect. 
Karlstadt&#x27;s answer was published in 1524 in Wittenberg, and is still extant. This showed that Karlstadt continued to reject the violence that led to the German Peasants&#x27; War. Another defamation was Luther&#x27;s accusation that Karlstadt was not authorized to preach at the city church in Wittenberg during Luther’s stay at Wartburg. The conversation ended when Luther gave Karlstadt a guilder and told him to write against him. In September 1524 Karlstadt was exiled from Saxony by Frederick the Wise and George, Duke of Saxony. Luther also wrote against Karlstadt in his 1526 &quot;The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ—Against the Fanatics&quot;.

===Peasant War===
When the Peasant War broke out, Karlstadt was threatened and wrote to Luther and asked for assistance. 
Luther took him in, and Karlstadt lived secretly in Luther&#x27;s house for eight weeks. However, Karlstadt had to sign a pseudo retraction, titled &quot;Apology by Dr. Andreas Karlstadt Regarding the False Charge of Insurrection Which has Unjustly Been Made Against Him.&quot; 
It also contained a preface by Luther. 
In March, Katharina, Luther&#x27;s wife, became godmother to one of Karlstadt&#x27;s children. Karlstadt was not allowed to preach or publish, and supported his family as a farmer and peddler near Wittenberg until 1529.

===Iconoclasm and Marian views===
Some of the Protestant reformers, in particular Andreas Karlstadt, together with Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the Decalogue&#x27;s prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven images of God. As a result, religious statues and images were destroyed and damaged in spontaneous individual attacks as well as unauthorised iconoclastic riots. Erasmus described in a letter of 1529 such a riot that had occurred in Basel:

Karlstadt has been seen as closely associated with &quot;Bildersturm&quot; (see Beeldenstorm), as he was at the time. In 1522, he convinced the Council of Wittenberg to order the removal of a number of images from the local churches, which had &quot;catastrophic consequences.&quot; Martin Luther distanced himself from these actions. On 12 March 1522 Karlstadt spoke about Marian pictures, which were venerated at the time, and urged that they all be removed. Special aim was taken at Marian pictures visited in pilgrimages, but he also called for the removal of all public religious imagery and symbols. He asked for the destruction of Marian shrines such as the church Mary the Beautiful in Regensburg. Karlstadt was supported by Martin Bucer, Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin.

Yet this was more than a local German event. Significant iconoclastic riots took place in Zürich (in 1523), Copenhagen (1530), Münster (1534), Geneva (1535), Augsburg (1537), and Perth (1559). The Seventeen Provinces (now the Netherlands and Belgium and parts of northern France) were hit by a large wave of Protestant iconoclasm in the summer of 1566. In the Netherlands this is called the &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot; and began with the destruction of all the images of the Monastery of Saint Lawrence in Steenvoorde after a &quot;Hagenpreek&quot; (field sermon) by Sebastiaan Matte, and the sacking of the Monastery of Saint Anthony after a sermon by Jacob de Buysere. The &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot; is often held to mark the start of the Dutch Revolt against the Habsburg rulers of the Netherlands, although the fighting did not begin in earnest for some years. 
===Death and legacy===
Fleeing Saxony, Karlstadt served as a minister in Switzerland in Altstätten and Zürich. In 1534, he went to Basel as minister of the university church and Professor of Hebrew and Dean of the university. He remained in Basel until he died of the plague on 24 December 1541.

During Karlstadt&#x27;s lifetime he published about 90 writings in about 213 editions. Between the years 1518–1525, 125 editions of his works were published in Germany, more than any other writer, save Luther. Karlstadt anticipated many Anabaptist viewpoints. His books on the Lord&#x27;s Supper were published with the co-operation of the Swiss Brethren in Zürich, specifically Felix Mantz and probably Andreas Castelberg, as well as Karlstadt&#x27;s brother-in-law, Gerhard Westerburg of Cologne, who baptized over 2,000 adults in his swimming pool. Karlstadt&#x27;s influence on Protestantism in general included the abolition of mandatory celibacy (he married more than three years before Luther, and published several writings on the subject, both in Latin and German). As to images and liturgy, he influenced Zwingli and the Anabaptists directly, and, indirectly, the Baptists and Presbyterian Protestants. He had a remarkable impact on the furrier Melchior Hoffman, who spread Anabaptist ideas to northern Germany and what is now the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, the founders of the English Baptists, John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, accepted central teachings from the Waterlander Mennonites.

<doc id="1036673" wikidata="Q1140480" url="?curid=1036673" title="With the Lights Out">
<text>With the Lights Out is a box set by the American rock band Nirvana, released on November 23, 2004. It contains three CDs and one DVD of previously rare or unreleased material, including B-sides, demos, and rehearsal and live recordings. The title comes from the lyrics of Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 single &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. 

&quot;With the Lights Out&quot; was planned for release in 2001, but was delayed by a legal battle with Courtney Love, the widow of Nirvana singer, Kurt Cobain. As of 2016, it had sold 546,000 copies in the US.

==Background==
Rumors of a posthumous Nirvana anthology surfaced in the mid-1990s, not long after the death of the singer and guitarist, Kurt Cobain, in April 1994. It was reported in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in April 1999 that the surviving Nirvana members, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, were planning a box set to be released in 2000 at the earliest. It was later announced that a 45-track box set would be released in September 2001, to mark the 10th anniversary of the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, but it was delayed by a legal battle with Cobain&#x27;s widow, Courtney Love.

Much of the dispute centered on the unreleased song &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot;, recorded in January 1994 during the band&#x27;s final studio session. Grohl and Novoselic wanted it for the box set, but Love blocked its release and sued them for control of Nirvana&#x27;s legacy. Love&#x27;s lawsuit asserted that &quot;the parties have fundamentally different concepts of how to manage the musical and artistic legacy of Kurt Cobain&quot;, which resulted &quot;in a stalemate of decision making&quot;. She believed that &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; would be &quot;wasted&quot; on a box set, and instead belonged on a single-disc compilation similar to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;1&quot;.

In 2002, the legal battle was settled, and &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; appeared on the &quot;best-of&quot; compilation &quot;Nirvana&quot;. This paved the way for what became the &quot;With the Lights Out&quot; box set, which arrived in November 2004, over three years after its original release date but with more music than originally promised, including an acoustic demo of &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot;.

==Release==
===Promotion===
Before the release of &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, a promotional EP, &quot;Selections from With the Lights Out&quot;, was sent to radio stations, featuring the songs &quot;White Lace and Strange&quot;, &quot;Blandest&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; from the box set. &quot;Lithium&quot; was also released as an exclusive iTunes downloadable single on November 22, 2004. The music video for the original version of &quot;In Bloom&quot;, made in 1990 and first released on the &quot;Sub Pop Video Network Program&quot; VHS compilation in 1991, was released to music television to promote the box set. The video appears on the box set&#x27;s DVD. An online trailer was also released for the box set, featuring footage from the DVD and audio from the three CDs.

===Packaging===
&quot;With the Lights Out&quot; is packaged in heat-sensitive material which changes color when touched, revealing images of recording session tapes.

Each of the three CDs loosely represents the rare recordings from three periods in Nirvana&#x27;s history, in line with the band&#x27;s three studio albums, &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;Nevermind&quot; and &quot;In Utero&quot;, which were released in 1989, 1991 and 1993 respectively. The DVD contains rare live performances and rehearsals from throughout the band&#x27;s career.

It includes a 60-page booklet which contains liner notes by Thurston Moore of the American rock band Sonic Youth and the journalist Neil Strauss, as well as photographs and a chronological catalog of the band&#x27;s recording history, including studio sessions, television and radio appearances, live performances and home demo recordings sessions.

The band&#x27;s May 6, 1987 radio session at KAOS 89.3 FM in Olympia, Washington, is mislabeled as being from April 17, 1987.

==Reception==

&quot;With the Lights Out&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom saw it as a valuable glimpse into the band&#x27;s evolution. Julian Marshall of the &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a humanising, comprehensive and often heartbreaking document of a man who, in five years, changed the face of music, almost by accident&quot;. John Jeremiah Sullivan of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; called it &quot;an appropriately eccentric testament to Cobain&#x27;s talent&quot;.

However, several critics felt it contained too much second-rate material never intended for release. Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote, &quot;Those hoping for a trove of overlooked gems will be disappointed ... Simply put, there&#x27;s enough good stuff here for a solid single disc.&quot; Tim O&#x27;Neil of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;The majority of the material presented here will appeal only to a select group of hardcore fans, music historians and critics.&quot;

==&quot;Sliver: The Best of the Box&quot;==

===Recording and release===
&quot;Sliver: The Best of the Box&quot; is a compilation album by the American rock band, Nirvana, released in November 2005. It contains 19 tracks from the band&#x27;s 2004 rarities box set, &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, as well as three previously unreleased recordings: &quot;Spank Thru&quot;, from the 1985 &quot;Fecal Matter&quot; demo, a 1990 studio recording of &quot;Sappy&quot;, and a 1991 boombox demo of &quot;Come as You Are&quot;. &quot;Sliver: The Best of the Box&quot; opened at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Nielson Soundscan reported that as of 2016, &quot;Sliver: The Best of the Box&quot; has sold 376,000 copies in the U.S.

===Artwork===
According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the title and cover photograph for &quot;Sliver: The Best of the Box&quot; were chosen by Frances Bean, the daughter of Cobain and Courtney Love. The cover photograph depicts a cardboard box filled with Nirvana and Cobain tapes, including a copy of the Fecal Matter demo. Some of the tapes have spilled out of the box and are strewn across the floor.

<text>PartiallyClips was a webcomic, created by Rob Balder, which ran from 2002 to 2015. At the start of 2010, Balder handed authorship of the comic to Tim Crist, the comedy musician behind Worm Quartet.

== Premise ==
&quot;PartiallyClips&quot; is a constrained comic. Each three-panel strip consists of a single clip art image – the comic has no original art – repeated and unchanged in each panel, with added speech balloons and/or captions to create the joke.

&quot;PartiallyClips&quot; tends to use dark humor; frequently, the picture used is rather idyllic, which is common in public-domain clip art, but the added dialogue or captions twist the scene. &quot;PartiallyClips&quot; also frequently comments on modern life and culture, especially aspects of Internet culture. There are no recurring characters or plots.

Its name is a mondegreen: &quot;Partially Clips&quot; sounds similar to &quot;Partial eclipse&quot;.

== Distribution and reception ==
&quot;PartiallyClips&quot; was updated twice weekly, on Sundays and Thursdays. The &quot;partiallyclips.com&quot; website stopped updating on 17 June 2015. During 2018, the PartiallyClips website went down and as of July 2023 remains unavailable. The archives were available on the Erfworld domain, but are no longer available after that domain has largely been taken down due to personal tragedy.

In addition to its online audience, the strip was also self-syndicated to print, targeted at alternative weekly newspapers. It appeared in roughly 25 newspapers and magazines, and was published in a book, &quot;Suffering For My Clip Art: The Best Of Partially Clips Volume 1&quot;. Material from &quot;PartiallyClips&quot; was included in &quot;&quot;.

PartiallyClips was included in a 2009 short list of webcomics included in an NPR article. The article&#x27;s author, Glen Weldon, described it as &quot;a combination of found art, a finely honed comic sensibility, and awesomeness run rampant.&quot;

<text>Joseph Keter (born 13 June 1969) is a former Kenyan athlete, winner of 3000 m steeplechase at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Born in Lessos, Nandi District, Joseph Keter, an officer of Kenyan Army, had only one good season throughout his athletics career, which culminated with an Olympic gold medal.

==Career==
In Atlanta, the hot favourite to 3000 m steeplechase gold medal was a world record holder Moses Kiptanui. But in the Olympic final, Kiptanui was strongly challenged by his Armed Forces&#x27; colleague Keter. The Kenyan pair reached the final water jump side by side, but then Keter slowly edged ahead to win the gold medal by 1.11 seconds.

After the Olympic Games, Keter beat Kiptanui again in Zürich, running his personal best 8.05.99. After that glorious season, Keter kept running for some seasons and won the IAAF Grand Prix in 3000 m steeplechase in 1997.

<doc id="1036698" wikidata="Q916302" url="?curid=1036698" title="Worlds Apart (...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead album)">
<text>Worlds Apart is the fourth studio album by ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. It was released on January 25, 2005 by Interscope Records and reached #92 on the UK Albums Chart.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Rest Will Follow&quot;, was played on college radio and on some alternative stations throughout America. &quot;Caterwaul&quot; also received some airplay. &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; sold 13,000 copies in its first week of release in America, and went on to sell 56,000 albums in total, approximately half of what &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; sold in America.

==Production==
The album release was postponed from the winter of 2004 to January 2005 by Interscope to protect it from late-year releases by Eminem (also released on Interscope) and Destiny&#x27;s Child., in effect giving a better selling market. Vocalist Conrad Keely commented: &quot;I have constant anxiety that the record won&#x27;t sell. We hope we appeal to not just people of this generation, but people of future generations. We&#x27;re trying to do something that&#x27;s timeless and timely. Something that&#x27;s culturally significant. To have it overlooked would be, for me, a nightmare.&quot;
===Design===
In an interview with PopMatters, Keely described the development of the &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; cover art, stating that while he typically incorporates his free time drawings and paintings into the band&#x27;s albums, this cover collage was more specifically designed. However, Interscope insisted that he cite and clear all sources of his art, much of which was found in museums around the world. Given the improbability of the task, illustrator Cyril Van der Haegen was hired to paint Keely&#x27;s design and tweak various elements. Keely also summarized the theme of the collage:
&quot;I wanted an allegory depicting the history of human conflict. I wanted everybody to be fighting, like in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, where all the superheroes are fighting each other. I actually wanted to sneak in one of the &quot;New Mutants&quot;.&quot;

==Reception==

The album so far has a score of 67 out of 100 from Metacritic based on &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Filter&quot; gave the album a score of 92% and called it &quot;the best album Trail of Dead has ever made.&quot; Neumu.net gave it nine stars out of ten and called it &quot;a stunning showcase for AYWKUBTTOD&#x27;s mature sound, full of unexpected subtleties, musical wild-cards and detours.&quot; E! Online gave it an A− and called it &quot;killer stuff for any frame of mind.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a very favorable review and stated that &quot;Trail of Dead has made the album of its career.&quot; Yahoo! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and called it &quot;A frequently astonishing album that combines bruising rock and limp-wristed flourish in almost equal measure.&quot; Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it &quot;a delicately violent piece of art.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave it a favorable review and stated that &quot;With &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, the band takes a confident, blind leap toward a potentially confounding future, and lands solidly and triumphantly.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; gave it a B and stated that &quot;Between these boy-noise roils you can see how much the band want to be their generation&#x27;s Yes.&quot; &quot;Under the Radar&quot; gave it seven stars out of ten and stated that &quot;The band&#x27;s musical scope has significantly expanded... and for the better.&quot; Drowned in Sound gave it seven out of ten and said that the band might have &quot; missed the bullseye. But that&#x27;s no reason to yell &quot;sell out!&quot;, or to deride them as poseurs.&quot;

Other reviews are either average, mixed, or negative: &quot;Mojo&quot; gave the album three stars out of five and stated that &quot;for all that bombast... there&#x27;s a disappointing, un-Texan restraint.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; also gave it three stars and said it was &quot;no less viscerally thrilling [than its predecessor] but pursues a number of ear-bogglingly unlikely paths.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; likewise gave it three stars and called it &quot;Unexpectedly clean-cut... the time-signature shifts and feedback swirls that earned [the band] minor adulation are sidelined in favor of pushy, arena-sized choruses.&quot; Likewise, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; gave it three stars and called it &quot;The least pretentious--and most accessible--thing AYWKUBTTOD have ever released. That&#x27;s probably because it sounds a lot like your record collection.&quot; Tiny Mix Tapes also gave it three stars out of five and said, &quot;All these flowery production choices can at times be quite seductive, despite the glaring mishandling of the vocals astride them.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave it a mixed review and stated that &quot;the band relies almost entirely on Keely, who dabbles in major-chorded piano balladry, a Southern rock opera complete with down-home piano and backup voices, whispery Beth Orton-style trip-hop, and high-pitch heart-on-sleeve emoting. It&#x27;s all so precious; let&#x27;s hope they still break shit live.&quot; Drawer B also gave it a very mixed review and said that &quot;Trail of Dead sounds utterly reinvigorated yet dangerously reinvented.&quot; &quot;NME&quot;, however, gave it a score of three out of ten and said that the album &quot;reads like a suicide note of a band that&#x27;s tried to intellectualise its place in the canon of Western music and, in doing so, recognised its own irrelevance.&quot;

==Track listing==




† features a violin solo by Hilary Hahn&lt;br&gt;
‡ different from the live video from &quot;The Secret of Elena&#x27;s Tomb&quot;

==Track information==

===&quot;Ode to Isis&quot;===

The whole song follows a pattern of three bars of 5/4 followed by one bar of 6/4. It starts at a soft volume with only a piano, builds in volume and intensity, comes to include strings, and operatic-style singing, and ends with a woman&#x27;s shrill scream. The melody stays essentially the same throughout the whole song and from bar to bar, the only deviation being the last quarter note of the 6/4 phrases. The song starts with the basic melody played staccato on the lower end of the piano&#x27;s register. Tom-tom drums, a tambourine, singing and strings begin quietly at the start of the second melody cycle and steadily grow in intensity and volume throughout the whole song. The muted screams of women can be heard throughout the latter half of the song. At the very end of the song, a woman&#x27;s voice starts in the left channel and ends in the right as she says the name of the band. Aside from this spoken phrase, the lyrics are:
:&quot;Isis, Horus, Ra, Set&quot;
:&quot;Isis, Horus, Ra, Set&quot;
:&quot;Isis, Horus, Ra, Set&quot;
:&quot;Isis, Horus, Anubis&quot;

===&quot;Will You Smile Again?&quot;===
&quot;Will You Smile Again?&quot; is about &quot;the idea of the composer who is unable or unwilling to face the weight of their own genius, and allow their fears to stop them from accomplishing great work.&quot; The band wanted a picture of Brian Wilson, who was releasing &quot;Smile&quot; at the time, to accompany the song on the CD artwork. However, an art director at Interscope Records said they couldn&#x27;t, and so a picture of Bach appears instead.

===&quot;Worlds Apart&quot;===
&quot;Worlds Apart&quot; is a protest song, bemoaning the current state of American popular culture and recent United States foreign policy, specifically the War on Terrorism, also against MTV, soccer moms, and the state of parenting in today&#x27;s society. It makes explicit reference to the September 11, 2001 attacks with the lyrics &quot;How they laugh as we shovel the ashes / Of the twin towers. / Blood and death, we will pay back the debt / Of this candy store of ours.&quot; These lyrics are also briefly heard in a chanted reprise of this song, at the end of &quot;The Best&quot;.

<doc id="1036702" wikidata="Q1055486" url="?curid=1036702" title="Licensing Act 1737">
<text>The Licensing Act 1737 (10 Geo. 2. c. 28) or the Theatrical Licensing Act 1737 is a former act of Parliament in the Kingdom of Great Britain, and a pivotal moment in British theatrical history. Its purpose was to control and censor what was being said about the British government through theatre. The act was repealed by the Theatres Act 1843, which was itself replaced by the Theatres Act 1968. The Lord Chamberlain was the official censor and the office of Examiner of Plays was created under the act. The examiner assisted the Lord Chamberlain in the task of censoring all plays from 1737 to 1968. The examiner read all plays which were to be publicly performed, produced a synopsis and recommended them for licence, consulting the Lord Chamberlain in cases of doubt. The act also created a legal distinction between categories of &quot;legitimate theatre&quot; and &quot;illegitimate theatre&quot;.

==Forerunner==
The function of censorship of plays for performance (at least in London) fell to the Master of the Revels by the time of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The power was used mostly with respect to matters of politics and religion (including blasphemy). It was certainly exercised by Edmund Tylney, who was Master from 1579 to 1610. Tylney and his successor, George Buck, also exercised the power to censor plays for publication. The Master of the Revels, who normally reported to the Lord Chamberlain, continued to perform the function until, with the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, stage plays were prohibited. Stage plays did not return to England until the Restoration in 1660. During the creation of the Licensing of 1737, Robert Walpole was the standing Master of the Revels

== Purpose of the act ==
Laws regulating theatre in the early 18th century were not strictly enforced. People had free rein to say anything they wanted through theatre, including all their troubles with the government. Free speech in theatre was seen as a threat to the government, facilitating the spread of revolutionary ideas. The act enhanced government control and censorship.

== Examiner of Plays ==
In addition to reading plays and writing Reader&#x27;s Reports for the Lord Chamberlain the Examiners were expected to visit theatres to ensure their safety and comfort and to see that the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s rules were carried out with regard to the licences. They were also required to appear at subpoenas in law cases relating to licensing, and to examine Play Bills. From 1911 Examiners were required to write reports on plays for the Lord Chamberlain. A copy of the play script and Reader&#x27;s Report were held by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s office and are now held by the British Library in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Plays collection.

In the years 1922–1938 when The Earl of Cromer was the Lord Chamberlain nearly 13,000 plays were licensed, an average of 820 a year; under 200 plays were refused a licence, an average of 12 per year.

There were 21 Examiners of Plays between 1738 and 1968.

The Examiners had a variety of qualifications and experience for the position. Edward Pigott (1824–1895) was a journalist on the &quot;Daily News&quot; and had an extensive knowledge of European literature and languages. George Redford (d. 1916), a playwright, resigned his post in 1913 to become the first president of the British Board of Film Censors. Ernest Bendall (1846–1924) had been a clerk in the Paymaster-General&#x27;s Office for 30 years retiring in 1896 to become a journalist and drama critic for several London newspapers. Charles Brookfield was an actor, playwright and journalist. George Street was an essayist, novelist and playwright. Henry Game (d. 1966) trained as an artist, was an amateur actor and was known for his knowledge of the theatre. Charles Heriot (d. 1972) was an actor and producer. Sir St Vincent Troubridge (1895–1963) was in the military as well as being a theatre historian. Ifan Kyrle Fletcher (d. 1969) was a theatre historian and antiquarian bookseller. Timothy Harward studied theatre and literature at university, becoming a theatre journalist for the &quot;Irish Times&quot; and lecturer at Regent Street Polytechnic.

<doc id="1036703" wikidata="Q1756554" url="?curid=1036703" title="Mickey Blue Eyes">
<text>Mickey Blue Eyes is a 1999 American romantic comedy crime film directed by Kelly Makin. Hugh Grant stars as Michael Felgate, an English auctioneer living in New York City who becomes entangled in his soon-to-be father-in-law&#x27;s mafia connections. Several of the minor roles are played by actors later featured in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

The film&#x27;s title comes from Michael being forced to impersonate a gangster, who is spontaneously named &quot;Kansas City Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes&quot;; coincidentally, it is also a play on &quot;Jimmy Blue Eyes,&quot; nickname of real-life mobster Vincent Alo. Later on, the film served as an inspiration for 2007 Bollywood film &quot;Welcome&quot;.

The film was released on August 20, 1999. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $54.3 million against its $20 million budget.

==Plot==
Michael Felgate is an English auctioneer living in New York City where he manages the Cromwell auction house. He proposes marriage to his girlfriend Gina Vitale, but is disheartened to be turned down. Gina tearfully explains that her father Frank and most of her cousins and uncles are gangsters deeply involved in a Mafia crime family, and she is concerned that Michael will be forced into their world. Michael assures her that he will not let this happen, but barely is their engagement party over before he is unwittingly involved in a money laundering scam, and soon the FBI takes an interest in him.

When one of the money laundering scams at Michael&#x27;s auction house goes wrong, Gina&#x27;s cousin Johnny confronts and attacks Michael. Gina takes his gun and fires a warning shot into the ceiling, which ricochets and accidentally kills Johnny. Johnny&#x27;s father Vito finds out, and he tells Frank he will kill Gina unless Frank kills Michael during his wedding speech. Having grown fond of Michael, Frank confesses what Vito has ordered him to do to Michael and the two of them turn to the FBI in return for protection. The FBI set up an elaborate operation in which Michael&#x27;s execution will be faked at the wedding reception. Michael is given a hidden recording device and is tasked with trying to record Vito into admitting his criminal activity on tape before he is &quot;executed&quot;.

Michael&#x27;s plan fails, and when Vito realises that his execution is a set-up, he orders Vinnie to kill Michael. Vinnie shoots Gina in what appears to be an accident. Vito is arrested for ordering Michael&#x27;s execution. As Frank and Michael mourn Gina&#x27;s apparent death in the back of her ambulance, it is revealed that her death was faked as well, and that Vinnie and Gina were also involved with the FBI as a back-up plan.

==Cast==
== Production ==
On November 4, 1997, Hugh Grant was announced as a cast member of the film.

The film was originally set to be released internationally by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, through a financing agreement with one of the film&#x27;s producers Castle Rock Entertainment, but it ended up being released by Universal Pictures International instead. This is one of a handful of films, and among the last, until 2007, to be self-released by Universal internationally, and shortly afterwards, the theatrical distribution arm was merged into United International Pictures.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
The film earned $10.2 million in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $33.9 million in the United States and a total of $54.3 million worldwide. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; the film was a &quot;marginal money loser&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 45% based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;High-brow humorists doing low-brow humor never hit their stride.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

==Links to &quot;The Sopranos&quot;==
The film is notable for the number of actors who would go on to appear in the HBO TV series, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, including:

* Tony Sirico - Paulie Gualtieri
* John Ventimiglia - Artie Bucco
* Vincent Pastore - Sal &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero

* Joseph R. Gannascoli - Vito Spatafore
* Burt Young - Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Baccalieri, Sr.

<text>Solarized is the fourth solo album released by Ian Brown, the former lead singer of the Stone Roses. The album was first released in the United Kingdom on 13 September 2004.

==Background==
The album was the first album release on the revived Polydor imprint Fiction Records.

Canadian and Australian releases did not feature &quot;Happy Ever After&quot;. The North American edition of &quot;Solarized&quot; contains an exclusive U.S. bonus track called &quot;Lovebug&quot;.

The song &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; was used in an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; during the review of the 2007 Jaguar XK. It has also been used in the series &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot; and for the adverts of &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot;.

Unlike his previous, and subsequent albums, &quot;Solarized&quot; was not originally released on vinyl, but in April 2016, it was finally released on a limited run of 2000 vinyl copies as part of Record Store Day.

<text>Fort Borstal was built as an afterthought from the 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, by convict labour. Construction started in 1875 but was suspended in 1885. The fort was completed around 1895. it was one of a series of four forts that ringed Chatham.

Fort Borstal was designed to hold the high ground southwest of Rochester, South East England. It is of polygonal design and was not originally armed. An anti-aircraft battery was based there in the Second World War.

A gauge railway was built connecting the four Chatham ring forts of Borstal, Bridgewoods, Horsted and Luton. A rope-worked incline led west from Fort Borstal down to a gravel pit and wharf on the River Medway. About of track remains intact at Fort Borstal.

After many years&#x27; use as a pig farm and store for the nearby Young Offenders Institution it was sold in 1991 to a company hoping to make it a museum, but that proved unsuccessful and the fort has been converted into living accommodation. There is no public access to the site.

<text>KCJJ (1630 kHz, &quot;The Mighty 1630&quot;) is a radio station licensed to Iowa City, Iowa, United States. The station is owned by Stephen Soboroff&#x27;s (Steve Bridges) River City Radio, Inc.

KCJJ broadcasts with 10,000 watts during the day and 1,000 watts at night. It can be heard throughout Eastern Iowa during the day and in many states in the central and eastern United States at night. KCJJ streams on its website and through TuneIn and the KCJJ app. In studio shows are streamed on YouTube.

==Programming==

KCJJ has a full service format with hot adult contemporary music. The Morning Show is hosted by &quot;Captain&quot; Steve Bridges, Jim Hunter, Tom Suter, and Pat Harty. Middays are handled by Tommy Lang, and Nights by Molly Suter. Weekends include Tom and Liam Heath. Local News is aired hourly and High School Sports are featured nightly. KCJJ is affiliated with CBS and CNN. The station airs weathercasts from Severestudios.com, the syndicated Lex and Terry Show, The Mike O&#x27;Meara Show, and NASCAR auto racing.

==History==

KCJJ originated as an application for a new station on 1560 kHz in Iowa City, which was filed in 1971, but was not issued a construction permit until 1976. The station began regular broadcasting on January 15, 1977.

===Expanded Band assignment===

On March 17, 1997, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that 88 stations had been given permission to move to newly available &quot;Expanded Band&quot; transmitting frequencies, ranging from 1610 to 1700 kHz, with KCJJ authorized to move from 1560 kHz to 1630 kHz. A construction permit for the expanded band station was assigned the call sign KCJK on November 10. The next year, the two stations swapped call signs, with AM 1560 changing from KCJJ to KCJK, and AM 1630 changing from KCJK to KCJJ. This was reported locally as taking place at 6 am on October 14, although FCC records list the change taking place 9 days later.
FCC policy provided that original stations and their expanded band twins could operate simultaneously for up to five years, after which owners would have to turn in one of the two licenses, depending on whether they preferred the new assignment or elected to remain on the original frequency. It was decided to transfer full operations to the expanded band station, and on May 7, 2002, the license for the original station on 1560 kHz (KCJK), was cancelled, with AM 1630 continuing as KCJJ.

===99 Plus KFMH===
An Internet-only revival of the original 99.7 KFMH began streaming in March 2013, and is the sister station of KCJJ. 99pluskfmh.com has an adult alternative Album format, as it did originally from 1973–1994. Many of the original DJs have returned as has the program Off The Beaten Track, hosted by Roberto Nache. The station streams at https://99pluskfmh.com/ and on devices through TuneIn and the KCJJ app.

<doc id="1036756" wikidata="Q676855" url="?curid=1036756" title="ArmaLite AR-18">
<text>The ArmaLite AR-18 is a gas-operated rifle chambered for 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. The AR-18 was designed at ArmaLite in California by Arthur Miller, Eugene Stoner, George Sullivan, and Charles Dorchester in 1963 as an alternative to the Colt AR-15 design, a variant of which had just been selected by the U.S. military as the M16. A semi-automatic version known as the AR-180 was later produced for the civilian market. While the AR-18 was never adopted as the standard service rifle of any nation, its production license was sold to companies in Japan and the United Kingdom, and it is said to have influenced many later weapons such as the British SA80, the Singaporean SAR-80 and SR-88, the Belgian FN F2000, the Japanese Howa Type 89 and the German Heckler and Koch G36.

==Background==
Soon after the adoption of the 7.62×51mm NATO M14 rifle in 1957, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Continental Army Command (CONARC) began an investigation of small-caliber, high-velocity (SCHV) rifles as an offshoot of the military&#x27;s existing research program, Project SALVO. ArmaLite and Winchester Arms were solicited by CONARC to provide prototype automatic rifles chambered for high-velocity centerfire .22 rounds. The ArmaLite AR-15 was a scaled-down version of the 7.62mm AR-10, which had appeared too late to be a serious contender against the M14 for adoption by the US Army. Its competitor was the Winchester .224 Light Rifle, a &quot;Carbine&quot; Williams prototype carbine design in a .22 high velocity round which was similar to, but not interchangeable with, the .223 Remington (5.56×45mm). During the protracted U.S. military trials of the AR-15, ArmaLite&#x27;s corporate owners Fairchild essentially gave up on the design, and sold the AR-15 production rights to Colt. Fairchild also spun off ArmaLite as an independent company, allowing the new owners to buy all of the company&#x27;s designs except for the AR-10 and AR-15. When the U.S. military ultimately selected the AR-15 as the M16, ArmaLite could no longer profit from its adoption.

The ArmaLite AR-16 appeared in the later 1950s. The AR-16, a 7.62mm NATO selective-fire rifle, was Eugene Stoner&#x27;s final design for ArmaLite. The AR-16 and its predecessor, the AR-12 were designed by Stoner in response to demands by the military forces of smaller, less developed nations for a less expensive, yet state-of-the-art selective-fire military rifle that unlike the AR-10 and AR-15, could be produced inexpensively of heavy-gauge sheet metal using automatic screw machines, lathes, and presses. The AR-12 originally featured a direct-impingement (DI) gas operation system, but this was changed to a more conventional short-stroke gas piston in the AR-16 after ArmaLite sold the production rights to the DI system to Colt Firearms. The AR-16 had a short, 15-inch barrel, hinged wooden butt, and weighed 8.75 pounds empty; only three examples were built. Eugene Stoner left ArmaLite in 1961, shortly before Fairchild divested itself of ownership.

The U.S. military&#x27;s later adoption of the AR-15 gave legitimacy to its 5.56mm cartridge, and ArmaLite sought to develop a competing design chambered in 5.56mm that did not infringe on the Colt license agreement. With Stoner gone, it was decided to scale down the AR-16, and ArmaLite&#x27;s new chief designer, Arthur Miller, embarked on the project. The resulting 5.56mm design appeared in 1963 and was named the AR-18. Miller later received for the rifle in 1969.

==Construction and design==
Overall, the new AR-18 rifle is much more conventional than previous ArmaLite designs, although it uses the relatively new stamped steel construction from its predecessor, the AR-16. Despite being pioneered by the Germans during WW2 in weapons such as the MP 44, and later adopted for the Soviet AKM, the use of stamped and welded sheet metal components was still uncommon in the manufacture of military rifles in the West in the early 1960s, which had, until then, largely retained the use of traditional machined forgings. Compared to the smooth lines of the AR-15, which had demonstrably finer tolerances in parts fit, the AR-18 faced criticism over its stamped and welded construction. However, the rifle proved to be both reliable and very accurate at all ranges up to . Its simple construction promised significantly reduced production costs, and allowed it to be license-produced locally on less advanced machinery, potentially reducing dependence on foreign manufacturers.
The AR-18&#x27;s action is powered by a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel. The gas piston is of three-piece design to facilitate disassembly, with a hollow forward section with four radial gas vent holes fitting around a stainless steel gas block projecting rearwards from the foresight housing. The gas is vented from the barrel and travelled via a vent through the foresight housing into the hollow front section of the piston, which causes it to move rearwards a short distance. The rear end of the piston emerges through the barrel extension to contact the forward face of the bolt carrier, causing it in turn to move rearwards. The bolt itself is of similar configuration to the AR-15 with seven radial locking lugs engaging corresponding recesses in the barrel extension, and the extractor in place of the eighth lug. The bolt is moved into and out of the locked position via a cam pin that engaged a helical slot in the bolt carrier, which rides on two metal guide rods (each with its own return spring) instead of contacting the receiver walls, providing additional clearance for foreign matter entering the receiver. Unlike the AR-15, the cocking handle fits directly into a recess in the bolt carrier and reciprocates with it during firing, allowing the firer to force the breech closed or open if necessary. The cocking handle slot has a spring-loaded cover that can be closed by the user to prevent debris entering the receiver, and it will open automatically as the bolt carrier moves rearwards after the first shot. The recoil springs are housed within the receiver, differing from the AR-15 which houses its more elaborate buffer mechanism in the buttstock. The AR-18&#x27;s compact design enables the use of a side-folding stock with a hinging mechanism (which proved to be less than adequately rigid).

The sights are of similar design and sight picture to those of the AR-15 - a 2-position flip aperture rear sight and post foresight - but the rear sight is made of stampings. A notable change is the use of a more conventional lower sight line closer to the axis of the bore, in contrast to the elevated sights of the AR-15. A dovetail is spot welded to the receiver in front of the rear sight for a proprietary ArmaLite quick-detachable scope mount.

The magazines were of a brand new proprietary design and were different than those of the AR-15. The original magazines made by ArmaLite and Howa were of gray anodized aluminum alloy with black plastic followers and came in 5- and 20-round capacities. (The 5-round magazine, like that of the Colt AR-15 Sporter, was just a full-size 20-round magazine blocked to only hold 5 rounds.) They lacked the magazine catch cutouts of the AR-15 magazines, making them incompatible. Sterling Armaments Company later produced black-enameled steel magazines in 20- 30- and 40-round capacities that did have cutouts and were able to feed from an AR-15. However, the AR-18/AR-180 was never capable of using the Colt AR-15/M16&#x27;s stock 20- or 30-round STANAG magazines. Gunsmiths have been able to convert AR-15/M16 magazines to feed in the AR-18, though they require modified followers or they will put strain on the bolt catch.

The AR-18 was also designed to use the same standard accessories as the M16. It used a three-pronged flash hider that was similar to that used on the early M16. This was usually replaced by an aftermarket enclosed M16A1 &quot;birdcage&quot;-type model. It could mount the standard M7 bayonet, although it was not available for sale through ArmaLite. &quot;Sporterized&quot; late-production Howa-made AR-180 rifles had extended metal tabs through the mounting lugs to prevent this. A plastic copy of the fixed folding metal bipod issued with the early M-16 was available and came in a similar protective case. AR-180 users were leery of buying a non-adjustable bipod made of thermoset plastic so few were sold, making it a rare accessory today. A padded rifle case that could carry the rifle with the scope mounted was available. It could hold two spare 20-round magazines and the bipod or bayonet in pouches.

Overall, the design is simple and effective with some clever touches; for example the bolt guide rod assembly guides the bolt in the receiver, retains the recoil springs and the rear end of the top handguard, as well as serving as the latch holding the upper and lower receivers together in the closed position. Disassembly is somewhat similar to the AR-15, with the working parts accessed by the rifle pivoting open on a hinge pin immediately forward of the magazine well.

==Production==
The AR-18 was put into limited production at ArmaLite&#x27;s machine shop and offices in Costa Mesa, California. A semi-automatic version of the AR-18 known as the AR-180 was later produced for the civilian market between 1969 and 1972. ArmaLite was never equipped to build small arms on a production basis, and the Costa Mesa AR-18 and AR-180 rifles frequently show evidence of hand-fitting. A production license was granted to Nederlandsche Wapen-en Munitiefabriek (NWM) of Den Bosch, the Netherlands, but it is doubtful that any AR-18 rifles were actually produced there. A license to produce the AR-18/180 was then sold to Howa of Japan, and the rifle was produced from 1970 until 1974, when new controls on export of military arms by the Japanese government forced the company to cease all small arms production. Between 1975 and 1978, there was a brief pause in production as ArmaLite was finalizing an agreement with Sterling Armaments Company, United Kingdom to produce the rifle under license. From 1979 until 1985, Sterling produced the AR-18 and AR-180. In 1983, ArmaLite was sold to Elisco Tool &amp; Manufacturing of the Philippines, which planned to pitch the AR-18 as a replacement for the license-produced M16A1 then in service with the Armed Forces of the Philippines. As a result, production stopped in 1985 as the tooling was sent to the Philippines. Under Elisco several modifications to the design were implemented and twenty (20) prototypes of four designated types (AR 101, AR 102, AR 103, AR 104) were built and underwent testing and evaluation. About 3,500 of these rifles, collectively designated the &quot;AR Series 100&quot; were approved for production. Production plans for the AR Series 100 would fail to push through as Elisco would be dissolved and its assets liquidated in the late 1980s. In mid-1968 ArmaLite set up pilot production in its Costa Mesa plant producing 1,171 AR-18s and 4,018 AR-180s between 1969 and 1972. Howa produced 3,927 AR-180s between 1970 and 1974. Sterling manufactured 12,362 AR-180s between 1979 and 1985. In all, just 21,478 AR-180s were manufactured over 16 years of production between 1969 and 1985.

==Operational use==
Unlike the AR-15/M16, the AR-18 did not see substantial sales success, and was never officially adopted by any country as its standard service rifle. The reasons for this are unclear, but may have had something to do with the existing sales popularity of the AR-15/M16, as well as the need for additional field testing and evaluation of the Costa Mesa-produced rifles, which were still in the advanced prototype stage. The AR-18 was purchased for evaluation trials by various armed forces, including the United States (1964) and the United Kingdom (1966). These suffered various malfunctions during evaluation trials by various nations. During the US trials at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1964, the AR-18&#x27;s functioning was found to vary from lot to lot of ammunition. The evaluating board concluded that while the basic design of the AR-18 was sound, it required additional minor revisions and changes to improve safety and reliability before it could be considered for adoption as a service rifle. The British Ministry of Defence (MOD) tested the AR-18 in March 1966, and found the design unsatisfactory in performance during mud and sand trials. ArmaLite made several minor production modifications to the design commencing in 1965, and the U.S. Army was directed to re-evaluate the AR-18 at the end of 1969. Testing was conducted at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, conducted by arsenal employees and the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia. However, American procurement officials were not interested in acquiring yet another 5.56 mm service rifle. A number of deficiencies were listed and the testing authority stated that, although the AR-18 had military potential, it needed further development. In 1968, dissatisfied with efforts to market the AR-18, Arthur Miller left ArmaLite.

Instead, the AR-180 was sold on the civilian market, while the AR-18 sold in small quantities to police and law enforcement organizations, as well as armies and security forces of nations such as Botswana, Haiti, Malaysia and Eswatini. Still others found their way into the hands of paramilitary groups, such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Northern Ireland, (see also Provisional IRA arms importation). The ArmaLite rifle was for many years the most lethal weapon available to the IRA. For this reason, it became an iconic symbol within that movement. An Irish rebel song, &quot;Little Armalite&quot;, focuses on the role played by the AR-18 in the Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign. The Armalite company reportedly bought 1000 copies of a recording for its salesmen to distribute. The 1980s Republican political strategy of parallel political and paramilitary campaigns was also christened the &quot;Armalite and ballot box strategy&quot;.

==Variants==

The standard AR-18 versions manufactured by ArmaLite, Howa and Sterling differ only in minor details. ArmaLite and Howa rifles have a satin grey phosphate finish, while Sterling rifles sported two finishes; Serial numbers S15001 through S20000 had a black, glossy enamel painted finish. Starting with serial number S20001, a blued finish was used for the remainder of production. Rifles were normally equipped with a sling, cleaning kit (bore/brush), and a knife-type bayonet with scabbard. An optional bipod with a case was available.

The AR-180 is capable of semi-automatic fire only and was externally identical in appearance to the AR-18 with one exception; the selector has only two positions, omitting the third &quot;AUTO&quot; position found on the AR-18. There are minor differences between the variants; to select &quot;FIRE&quot; on the Howa rifles the selector lever must be pivoted 180 degrees from &quot;SAFE&quot; so it is pointing forward towards the muzzle (where &quot;AUTO&quot; would be on a selective-fire rifle), while on the Sterling rifles, the &quot;SEMI&quot; position is the same as the &quot;SEMI&quot; position on a selective-fire rifle; 90 degrees from &quot;SAFE&quot; with the selector lever pointing down. Towards the end of AR-180 production at ArmaLite&#x27;s Costa Mesa shop in 1972, some unused AR-18 lowers were used to assemble AR-180s. The &quot;SEMI&quot; and &quot;AUTO&quot; positions were scrubbed and the &quot;AUTO&quot; position was relabeled &quot;FIRE&quot;. The selector lever on these particular rifles would have to be pivoted 180 degrees from &quot;SAFE&quot; to &quot;FIRE&quot; the same way as Howa manufactured rifles.

Sterling made an AR-180 sporter variant called the &quot;Sharpshooter&quot;. It was identical to the regular AR-180 except it came with black neoprene covers for the forend and buttstock. The forend cover gave the shooter a positive gripping surface and the buttstock cover contained a cheekpiece pad to help gain a full cheekweld when shooting.

Sterling manufactured a small number of sporter variants called the AR-180 SCS, of which only 385 were reputed to have been made. It has a large single-piece wooden thumbhole stock that replaces the butt, pistol grip and handguard of conventional versions. The metal parts differ in the lack of the ejection port cover, a PH prefix to the serial number and adapted safety and magazine release controls.

Sterling also manufactured small numbers of a short version, the AR-18S. This version uses the same basic mechanism and folding butt, but has a barrel and a length of with the butt extended. The shortened barrel is fitted with a cone-shaped flash suppressor to address the additional muzzle flash resulting from the short barrel. Some examples have an additional pistol grip fitted to the underside of the handguard.

Sterling had also planned to market a pistol version of the AR-18S to complement the standard AR-180, known as the AR-180SP. A single prototype AR-180SP was completed and submitted to the ATF in 1982 to determine if it was suitable for importation, but it is not known if it was ever approved for import or if any more examples were imported beyond the lone prototype sent to ATF.

A 2.75 × 20 mm telescopic sight was available but few were sold. Early-production models are marked in meters rather than yards and have a different reticle. It is marked &quot;ArmaLite&quot;, and has a quick-detachable, see-through mount that attaches to an integral dovetail spot-welded to the top of the receiver. The mount could also feasibly be used with other scopes if they had a 1-inch diameter tube.

A delayed-blowback upper was also developed by Ross Rudd using a hesitation lock but not manufactured due to financial backing reasons.

==Later developments==
The ArmaLite brand was purchased in 1996 by Eagle Arms, a U.S. small arms manufacturer, which adopted the ArmaLite brand for its company. An updated model of the AR-180 was introduced in 2001 as the AR-180B, with a molded polymer lower receiver replacing the stamped steel original. The new lower receiver is combined with the buttstock, which is fixed on the AR-180B, instead of the side-folding butt on the original AR-18 and AR-180. Other AR-180B changes include the use of standard AR-15 trigger group and rear sight parts, a straight cocking handle replacing the earlier cranked style and the deletion of the original AR-18/180 spring-loaded dust cover for the cocking handle slot. The AR-15 magazine release is also used, in contrast to the original AR-18 which had a different magazine release and corresponding slot in the body of the magazine, meaning AR-15 magazines needed a new slot cut to fit properly in the AR-18. As a result, the AR-180B uses standard AR-15/M16 magazines. An AR-180B version with a Picatinny rail was planned for production. In 2007 the AR-180B was discontinued due to poor sales.

There are aftermarket parts to improve the AR-180B. NoDak Spud made a replacement black-anodized aluminum-alloy lower-receiver. StormWerkz made a series of stock adapters compatible with this model of lower receiver to allow the use of fixed or folding AR-180B or AR-15 stocks. StormWerkz also made an adapter that allowed the use of a Picatinny rail that comes in four variants and installs over the dovetail on the top of the receiver.

The Canadian company Wolverine Supplies teamed up with Canadian gunmaker Kodiak Defence to commission the creation of a new AR-180 variant, the WK180-C. The WK180-C does away with the stamped steel and polymer construction of the AR-18, AR-180, and AR-180B, instead, it uses 6061-T6 aluminium to form the upper and lower receivers. This rifle ships with an adaptor to mount AR-15 style stocks (and comes with a collapsible AR15 stock). As Length of pull (LOP) is long with many AR15 stocks, some users have retrofit Cz Vz58 folding stocks to these rifles. While this option works well, it requires the use of lower iron sights and optics.

In 2019 Brownells, Inc. released BRN-180 complete upper assembly, a new take on the AR-180 design built around the AR-18 short-stroke piston system. The BRN-180 is designed to be fitted to mil-spec AR-15 lower receivers and unlike standard AR-15s the BRN-180 can be fired with the stock folded. The BRN-180 comes with an adjustable gas block and a free-floating modular handguard and is available in barrel lengths.

== Influence ==
When the AR-18 was designed, a plethora of different methods of gas and recoil operation existed in self-loading intermediate caliber rifles. Since then, self-loading intermediate caliber rifles have converged toward three methods of gas operation. These are: AR-15 style direct impingement, the AK-style long stroke gas piston and the short-stroke gas system found in the AR-18 rifle. While the AK and AR-15 are the first and second most produced intermediate caliber rifles of all time, the AR-18 gas system is the ancestor for the majority of short stroke gas systems found in selective fire military rifles. The AR-18 mechanism is the basis for many rifles in major military service. Rifles which use a copy or derivative of the AR-18 gas system include: HK G36, HK416, FN F2000, FN-SCAR, Steyr AUG, CZ 805 BREN, Chinese QBZ-95, HOWA Type 89, SAR-88, T65, T86, T91, T112 and British SA80 family of weapon systems.

In some cases, designs borrow more than just the AR-18&#x27;s gas system. Successive rifle designs borrow other components such as the bolt carrier group or upper receiver. The HOWA Type 89 is an AR-18, modernized to fit the needs of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. The Singapore SAR-88 and Taiwanese T-91 utilize a complete AR-18 upper receiver. Early British SA80 prototypes featured ArmaLite produced AR-18 upper receivers mated to a prototype stamped metal bullpup lower receiver. The finalized SA80 weapon systems use the AR-18 gas system and bolt carrier group. The Remington Adaptive Combat Rifle derives its bolt carrier group from the AR-18.

<doc id="1036765" wikidata="Q5471557" url="?curid=1036765" title="Fort Luton">
<text>Fort Luton was built between 1876 and 1892 south of Chatham, Medway, South East England.
It is one of the five late Victorian land front forts built to defend the overland approaches to Chatham. It is the smallest of the Chatham forts and was built near to the village of Luton.
==Construction and purpose==
The fort was ordered under the auspices of the 1859/60 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom, but it was deleted by Parliament in an attempt to save money and divert funds to the construction of the sea forts, and the Land Front Forts of Milford Haven, Plymouth, Cork and Portsmouth/ Isle of Wight Fortresses. The 1869 &#x27;Report on the Construction Condition and Costs of Fortification&#x27; criticised the lack of landward protection for Chatham, yet it was not until 1872 that the Treasury relented and the land was purchased. Even so, it was not until 1876 that the order was given by the War Office, after approval by Parliament for construction to commence. The original design was by William Jervois, but as by 1876 he had been promoted to major general he had no further part in its planning. The work was surveyed and &quot;pegged out&quot; on the ground that same year. In 1877 work on the building started, using convict labour and an gauge light railway to bring up the materials from Borstal Creek jetty.

The method adopted was to build all structures directly on to the land surface, and no form of preparation tunnelling was attempted. The work was slow due to lack of funds and the insistence of using convict labour, which meant that the labour force was constantly changing due to release or transfers to other prisons. In 1882 the work stopped for a re-think and once again restarted in 1886 when the decision was taken to delete from the plan one quarter of the design. This meant the loss of the Main Magazine (which was to have been in the western corner) and one quarter of this structure survived, much modified to become the above ground water tank. The well was also removed from the plan so the water main had to be laid from Fort Horsted and the proposed under-bridge caponier was never even started. From 1886 to 1892, when the fort was finally completed, the ditch was dug and the spoil was used to cover the exposed buildings, some of which had been standing for over ten years, and to form the ramparts, the six very basic gun emplacements, two to each flank and a pair overlooking Luton Valley. Even so, no armament is on record as ever having been issued to Fort Luton other than that brought in by units participating in the Annual Militia and Volunteer camps. The final act of engineering was the installation of the drawbridge in 1892 which is a rare type of rolling bridge and possibly the only one still left in the UK

==Siege trials==
For the next thirteen years the fort was used for summer camps and, on alternate years, the Chatham Siege Trials. The final one in 1907 was the largest in both scope and number of men employed, and was in effect a rehearsal for a major war. Three breaches were made in the counterscarp wall and three &quot;camoflets&quot; were exploded in the moat bottom. The &quot;defenders&quot; dug a large counter-mine shaft outwards from the base of the moat. The breaches were repaired in 1908 by infilling with flint rubble, but the main counter-mine shaft was left. As a result of all this, in 1914, the north scarp wall shifted slightly and had to be braced by a steel joist from off the top of the counterscarp wall. The damage to the moat and the subsequent repair are still visible.

==Layout of the fort==
The Fort consists of a D-shaped rampart with prepared earthen gun positions for movable armament, two to each flank. The front parapet was prepared for infantry defence. Beneath the rampart are four ammunition stores with vertical lifts to handling rooms on the rampart above. To the rear of the main rampart at the gorge of the fort is a series of eight casemated barrack rooms serving as accommodation for the garrison, ammunition stores and general stores. All are constructed of concrete with an earth covering. At each end of the casemates is a tunnel to the ammunition stores. The casemates formed a longitudinal parados protecting the ramparts from reverse fire. The main entrance to the fort was over the rolling bridge at the centre of the casemates. The ditch surrounding the fort was intended to be dry.

==The ditch==
The ditch is lined with concrete on both the scarp and counterscarp faces. It has on both faces a slight batter of three degrees from the vertical. The depth varies from 25 ft. to 30 ft. maximum and the width at the base also varies, being wider on the rear (long north east to south west) face and at its narrowest on the southern and northern flanks. It is 15 ft. wide. There are no caponiers or counterscarp galleries in the ditch, the only known major British Defence work to adopt a purely passive defence posture.

There is much evidence of the 1907 siege works in this ditch, three of the counter-mine shafts still survive, now mostly covered up with debris and rubbish (post 1962). Near the RSJ which spans the moat are seen five massive cracks and more repair work, again from the siege trials of 1907, but this time, the hole in the base of the ditch was not dug by the defenders but was the result of a failed &quot;camoflet&quot; or &quot;petard&quot;. Accounts vary as to the title of the device used, but it was a type of tunnel driven from the attacker&#x27;s side along the length of the moat to here and exploded. The first left the now mostly back-filled crater but at the second attempt blew a section of the wall outwards causing the damage still to be seen.

After the sale of Fort Luton to Kent County Council the ditch fell into rapid disuse and became an illegal dump for all manner of refuse. A great pile of debris has been allowed to build up beneath and to either side of the drawbridge and beneath the RSJ. The disuse of the ditch has also caused much growth of vegetation.

==The fort in use==
From 1914 to 1919 the fort was used as a Transit Barracks for troops en route to Europe. From 1920 till 1933 it was used as a store. In 1938 conversion of the fort to a Gun Operations Room (GOR) began. In August 1939 it opened as GOR for the 27th. AA Brigade (Thames and Medway South) Gun Defended Area. Brigadier C.W. Bayne-Jardin D.S.C. M.C. was in command until relieved circa 1942, after which other officers of the same rank continued in command until December 1945.

From 1945/6 to 1961 the fort was used by Army Cadet Force and T.A. Summer camps. In 1961 or 1962 it was sold to Kent County Council (D100 procedure) for educational uses, but the KCC just wanted the land to build the nearby Fort Luton Boys Secondary School, and the fort was abandoned. In 1990 it was bought by a private individual who ran the site as a model museum and visitor attraction with tea shop. In 2001 the fort closed and has since been taken into private ownership and is being restored. The fort has statutory Scheduled monument status.

Fort Luton has been under new ownership since 2012; after 3 years it was decided that it should become a community interest company.

<text>Fort Amherst, in Medway, South East England, was constructed in 1756 at the southern end of the Brompton lines of defence to protect the southeastern approaches to Chatham Dockyard and the River Medway against a French invasion. Fort Amherst is now open as a visitor attraction throughout the year with tours provided through the tunnel complex

==History==

The primary purpose of all the Medway fortifications was the defence of the Naval Dockyard. This was largely the result of the Raid on the Medway in 1667 when the Dutch fleet inflicted heavy damages on the dockyard. Defences were planned for the dockyard from 1708 and land was then acquired by two Acts of Parliament in 1708 and 1709. The land was surveyed in 1715 by the Duke of Marlborough. The first plan of defences was an enceinte (ring of fortifications), from Gun Wharf, Chatham, to north of the village of Brompton.

In 1755, the &#x27;Prince of Wales&#x27; Bastion, &#x27;Prince Williams Bastion&#x27;, &#x27;Kings Bastion&#x27;, &#x27;Prince Edwards Bastion&#x27;, &#x27;Prince Henry&#x27;s Bastion&#x27; and the &#x27;Prince Fredericks Bastion&#x27; were all built. These and the ditches, built during the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63), became known as the &quot;Chatham lines&quot; and were entered by four gateways with bridges. The fortifications were designed in 1755 by Captain John Peter Desmaretze of the Board of Ordnance and consisted of a earthwork ditch and a parapet.

In 1757, an infantry barracks (for a troop garrison) was built to man the defences.

During the American Revolutionary War (1778–83), the lines were enhanced and strengthened. The strongpoint of the design were two Redoubts - &#x27;Amherst&#x27; (at the southern end) and &#x27;Townsend&#x27; (at the northern end). Amherst Redoubt later became Fort Amherst. Each was equipped with 14 42-pounders, 10 9-pounders, 8 6-pounders and 2 4-pounder guns.

In 1779, during the construction, workmen found an existing foundation of a Roman building. Several finds, including pieces of Roman brick and tile, were made. Roman coins were also found, including one of the Empress Faustina, and one of the Emperor Claudius. The finds were recorded by Rev. James Douglas, working as Lt Douglas with the Royal Engineers &#x27;North Lincs Militia, who later wrote a book describing all of his archaeological research - &quot;Nenia Britannica&quot;.
During the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15) the Chatham defences were enlarged and considerably strengthened. Further batteries were added (such as the Cornwallis Battery) and the ditches revetted (lined with brick), to the plans of General Hugh Debbrieg, chief engineer for Lord Amherst. Debbrieg had originally helped in the &quot;Cumberland Lines&quot; planning with Capt. Desmaretze. His plan for the Chatham lines, drawn by Joseph Heath and dated 1755, is kept at the British Museum.

Also in 1802–11, prisoners, mostly convicts from St Mary&#x27;s Island, were set to work on extending the tunnels and creating vast underground stores and shelters, new magazines, barracks, gun batteries and guardrooms. More than 50 smooth-bore cannon were also mounted. The last building works were completed in about 1820. A maze of tunnels, used to move ammunition around the fort, were dug into the chalk cliffs.

A second gun battery, &#x27;Townsend Redoubt&#x27;, was built at the northeastern corner of the dockyard at the same time as Fort Amherst. Both forts were inside the 1756 brick-lined earthwork bastions known as the &quot;Cumberland Lines&quot;, which surrounded the whole east side of the dockyard down to St Mary&#x27;s Island. These have now been built over.

Fort Clarence in Rochester and Fort Pitt, on the Rochester-Chatham borders, were built in 1805–15 to protect the southern approaches.

Although the Lines were never put to the test, their design would have made a formidable defence against any invasion force.

In 1820, because of improvements in artillery equipment and greater firing ranges, the defences were declared obsolete. The entire fortified area was then used as a training-ground during the Victorian era, with practice sieges becoming so popular that they attracted thousands of visitors to Chatham. VIPs were seated on the Casemated Barracks that once stood in the Lower Lines and also on Prince William&#x27;s Barracks within Fort Amherst itself.

One such siege is described in Charles Dickens &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;.
Fort Amherst has been described by English Heritage as the most complete Napoleonic fortification in Britain and as such has great national historical significance.

In 1959, the site was scheduled as an ancient monument.

The fort was still in use during the Second World War when it served as an Air Raid Warning command post. It later underwent restoration to make more areas accessible to the public. An attempt was made by the Royal Engineers, to convert the Fort into a display ground for their military vehicles, as an offshoot of the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham, but this was prevented by a lack of finance.

==Current use==

In the late 1970s a group of enthusiasts were given permission by the Ministry of Defence to start tidying up the site, with the intention of restoring the fort. In 1980 the fort was purchased from the ministry by the Fort Amherst and Lines Trust and public open days began.

Fort Amherst is now managed and operated by the Fort Amherst Heritage Trust, a Registered Charity, which opens the fort to visitors every day of the year and provides daily tours at 11am and 2pm (subject to changes). The trust have also run a programme of regular events, including ghost tours, which typically take place on the first Friday evening of each month, and over-night paranormal investigations through the tunnels. Halloween tours have also taken place, where guests make their way through the dark rooms and passages.

Some of the cannons are fired on Sundays throughout the year and periodically during school holidays.

The fort was one of the filming locations for the 1986 Warner Bros. film &quot;The Mission&quot; and the 2011 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; as well as the 2015 BBC TV adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;.

On Sundays, during the summer 2008 season, the fort was open to the public, without charge, to promote the Great Lines Heritage Park and the proposed World Heritage Site application for Chatham Dockyard and its Defences.

In 2012 the 200th anniversary of the establishment, under Royal Warrant of the Royal Engineers at Brompton Barracks (the Royal School of Military Engineering), was marked by a team of Royal Engineers designing, building and assembling the Bridge. The bridge leads to a part of the fort also known as Spur Battery and to the Inner Lines - the Napoleonic defensive ditches. These parts are accessible only at special times and during guided visits.

In 2012 the fort received about 20,000 visitors.

<doc id="1036782" wikidata="Q933092" url="?curid=1036782" title="International Blind Sports Federation">
<text>The International Blind Sports Federation () is a non-profit organisation founded 1981 in Paris, France. It was formerly known as the International Blind Sports Association. IBSA&#x27;s mission is to promote the full integration of blind and partially-sighted people in society through sport and to encourage people with a visual impairment to take up and practise sports. IBSA is a full and founding member of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). 

In March 2022, in light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, it banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from its events.

== History ==

The International Blind Sports Association, known by the acronym &#x27;IBSA&#x27;, was formed in 1981.

The inaugural IBSA president was Paralympic runner and skier Jens Bromann (from Denmark) who served eight years, before becoming involved with the International Paralympic Committee from 1988 to 1992. IBSA was one of four organisations, later six, which formed the &#x27;International Co-coordinating Committee Sports for the Disabled in the World&#x27; (ICC) in 1982, which on 22 September 1989 became the International Paralympic Committee, as the global governing body of the Paralympic movement.

Second president (1993 to 2001) was Enrique Sanz (from Spain), followed by Enrique Perrez (2001 to 2005; also from Spain). Fourth president Michael Barredo (from Philippines) served two terms, from 2005 to 2013. Jannie Hammershøi (from Denmark), a former Paralympic goalball athlete, commenced in September 2013 to serve three terms.

The association changed its name to federation between 2002 and 2003, when based in Spain and used the web address www.ibsa.es. The federation was later relocated and registered to Bonn, Germany. Its logo also changed at sometime from a representation of a globe, to its initials with the federation name below; in both logos, the acronym of IBSA being represented in Braille dots.

Sixth president Sandro Di Girolamo (from Italy), the president of the Italian blind sports association, commenced a four-year term from Monday 11 October 2021. The term was cut short with an extraordinary general assembly for 30 June 2023, whereupon Ilgar Rahimov (from Azerbaijan) commenced his four-year term.

== Sports ==

IBSA is the international federation for several sports for people with a visual impairment, including three Paralympic sports (blind football, goalball and Para judo), powerlifting, ten-pin bowling, nine-pin bowling, torball, and showdown. 

Competition is held within five regions: Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. For the sport of goalball, competitively Asia and Oceania are drawn together as &#x27;Asia-Pacific&#x27; region.

== Sporting events ==
IBSA&#x27;s showcase event is the IBSA World Championships and Games, held every four years. The first games took place in 1998 in Madrid, Spain, followed by the event in 2003 at Quebec City, Canada. The third edition of the games was held in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2007, and the 2011 games took place in Antalya, Turkey.

In 2015, between 8 May and 18 May, the 5th IBSA World Championships and Games was held in Seoul, South Korea, and included competitions in powerlifting, judo, goalball, football, chess, tenpin bowling, tandem cycling, swimming, showdown, and athletics.

IBSA also organizes world and regional championships in many of its sports. Regional or continental championships are generally held in odd years, while world championships take place every four years in even years when there are no Paralympic Games.

<doc id="1036786" wikidata="Q5471349" url="?curid=1036786" title="Hoo Fort">
<text>Hoo Fort is a nineteenth-century military installation on the River Medway in Kent, England, that formed part of the defences of Chatham Naval Dockyard. Hoo Fort, like Fort Darnet downstream, was built on the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission. It is located on Hoo Island covering Pinup Reach, the inner navigable channel of the River Medway. Hoo Island sits to the south of the Hoo Peninsula and is within the parish of Hoo, Kent. The fort can be viewed from along the Saxon Shore Way, accessible from Vicarage Lane in Hoo.

==History==

Originally designed for two tiers of guns mounted in a circle, with a boom strung between Hoo Fort and Fort Darnet, there were many problems with subsidence, and after extensive cost overruns the forts were completed in 1871 with a single tier of eleven 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns, and no boom. Each gun was mounted in an individual casemate with heavily armoured firing port.

The forts were decommissioned before the First World War. In the Second World War, the fort was used as an observation post, with platforms and pillboxes built on top. The fort is still in fair condition. It is a Scheduled Monument and is owned by Medway Ports.

<text>Fort Darnet is a nineteenth-century military installation on the River Medway in Kent, England, that formed part of the defences of Chatham Naval Dockyard. Fort Darnet, like its twin Hoo Fort upstream, was built on the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission on an island covering Pinup Reach, the inner navigable channel of the River Medway.

Building started on the island in 1870 and then finished in 1872. The forts were originally designed for two tiers of guns mounted in a circle, with a boom strung between them, but there were many problems with subsidence. After extensive cost overruns they were completed in 1872 with one tier of eleven guns: a mixture of eight 9-inch and three 7-inch rifled muzzle-loaders. The boom was not implemented, though there were plans to mine the channel if thought needed. Fort Darnet was originally designed for a garrison of up to 100 men.

The fort was used for gunnery practice until one of the guns cracked in its casemate, as reported in ‘The Chatham Observer’ on 25 January 1879.

The forts were never used in anger, and were decommissioned before the First World War. In the Second World War the fort was used as an observation post, with platforms and pillboxes built on top. The fort is still in fair condition, however the magazine level is flooded. The island can be freely visited by boat, though the landing is muddy.

Up to the 1980s, the island was used for picnicking and other leisure pursuits.

It is scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.

<text>Dow Medical College is a public medical school located in the city of Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. It was founded in 1945 and named after British civil servant Sir Hugh Dow, Governor of Sindh.

In 2003, it became a constituent college of the newly formed Dow University of Health Sciences.

==History==
Sir Hugh Dow laid foundation stone of Dow Medical College, Karachi, on 10th December 1945, at the site of old NJV School. Three weeks later, on 31st December 1945, the college consisting of forty-five students, including one female Muslim student, transferred from Hyderabad to Karachi. The Government of Sindh under the lead of then Health minister Dr. Hemandas Wadhwani, arranged this transfer. The 20 member teaching faculty was led by Dr Kewalram Tarasing Ramchandani as the Principal. Some staff taught multiple subjects. It was initially housed in the old NJV High School Building on Mission Road. The new building was inaugurated in November 1946. Until 1947, it was an affiliate of University of Bombay. After the independence of India, it was under the University of Sindh. After the University of Karachi was founded, it became its affiliate. It was in 2003 when the Dow University of Health Sciences was established as an independent institution, with Dow Medical College and two other colleges being put under its umbrella.

==E-CME Program ==

Dow University of Health Sciences launched its web-based Continuing Medical Education Program named the &quot;e-CME Program for the Family Physicians&quot;.

==Social service activities==
==Notable alumni==

<text>The Arnolfini Portrait (or The Arnolfini Wedding, The Arnolfini Marriage, the Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife, or other titles) is an oil painting on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, dated 1434 and now in the National Gallery, London. It is a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.

It is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich &quot;in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello&#x27;s or Masaccio&#x27;s work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term&quot;. The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.

Van Eyck used the technique of applying several layers of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour. The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini&#x27;s world. Van Eyck took advantage of the longer drying time of oil paint, compared to tempera, to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms. The wet-in-wet (wet-on-wet), technique, also known as , was highly utilized by Renaissance painters including Jan van Eyck. The medium of oil paint also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.

The illusionism of the painting was remarkable for its time, in part for the rendering of detail, but particularly for the use of light to evoke space in an interior, for &quot;its utterly convincing depiction of a room, as well of the people who inhabit it&quot;. Whatever meaning is given to the scene and its details, and there has been much debate on this, according to Craig Harbison the painting &quot;is the only fifteenth-century Northern panel to survive in which the artist&#x27;s contemporaries are shown engaged in some sort of action in a contemporary interior. It is indeed tempting to call this the first genre painting – a painting of everyday life – of modern times&quot;.

==Description==
Jan van Eyck&#x27;s characteristic Early Netherlandish style depicts the scene with a high level of detail. The painting is generally in very good condition, though with small losses of original paint and damage, which have mostly been retouched. Infrared reflectograms of the painting show many small alterations, or pentimenti, in the underdrawing: to both faces, to the mirror, and to other elements. The couple is shown in an upstairs room with a chest and a bed in it during early summer as indicated by the fruits on the cherry tree outside the window. The room probably functioned as a reception room, as it was the fashion in France and Burgundy where beds in reception rooms were used for seating, except, for example, when a mother with a new baby received visitors. The window has six interior wooden shutters, but only the top opening has glass, with clear bulls-eye pieces set in blue, red and green stained glass.

The two figures are very richly dressed; despite the season both their outer garments, his tabard and her dress, are trimmed and fully lined with fur. The furs may be the especially expensive sable for him and ermine or miniver for her. He wears a hat of plaited straw dyed black, as often worn in the summer at the time. His tabard was more purple than it appears now (as the pigments have faded over time) and may be intended to be silk velvet (another very expensive item). Underneath he wears a doublet of patterned material, probably silk damask. Her dress has elaborate &quot;dagging&quot; (cloth folded and sewn together, then cut and frayed decoratively) on the sleeves, and a long train. Her blue underdress is also trimmed with white fur.

Although the woman&#x27;s plain gold necklace and the rings that both wear are the only jewellery visible, both outfits would have been enormously expensive, and appreciated as such by a contemporary viewer. There may be an element of restraint in their clothes (especially the man) befitting their merchant status – portraits of aristocrats tend to show gold chains and more decorated cloth, although &quot;the restrained colours of the man&#x27;s clothing correspond to those favoured by Duke Philip of Burgundy&quot;.
The interior of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, and would have been very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands. There existed a friendship between Giovanni Arnolfini and Philip the Good who sent his court painter Jan van Eyck to portray Arnolfini Double. The relation possibly began with a tapestry order including the images of Notre Dame Cathedral in return of a good payment.

The view in the mirror shows two figures just inside the door that the couple are facing. The second figure, wearing red, is presumably the artist although, unlike Velázquez in , he does not seem to be painting. Scholars have made this assumption based on the appearance of figures wearing red head-dresses in some other van Eyck works (e.g., the &quot;Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)&quot; and the figure in the background of the &quot;Madonna with Chancellor Rolin&quot;). The dog is an early form of the breed now known as the Affenpinscher.

The painting is signed, inscribed and dated on the wall above the mirror: &quot;Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434&quot; (&quot;Jan van Eyck was here 1434&quot;). The inscription looks as if it were painted in large letters on the wall, as was done with proverbs and other phrases at this period. Other surviving van Eyck signatures are painted in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; on the wooden frame of his paintings, so that they appear to have been carved in the wood.

==Identity of subjects==
In their book published in 1857, Crowe and Cavalcaselle were the first to link the double portrait with the early 16th century inventories of Margaret of Austria. They suggested that the painting showed portraits of Giovanni [di Arrigo] Arnolfini and his wife. Four years later James Weale published a book in which he agreed with this analysis and identified Giovanni&#x27;s wife as Jeanne (or Giovanna) Cenami. For the next century most art historians accepted that the painting was a double portrait of Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini and his wife Jeanne Cenami, but a chance discovery published in 1997 established that they were married in 1447, thirteen years after the date on the painting and six years after van Eyck&#x27;s death.

It is now believed that the subject is either Giovanni di Arrigo or his cousin, Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini, and a wife of either one of them. This is either an undocumented first wife of Giovanni di Arrigo or a second wife of Giovanni di Nicolao, or, according to a recent proposal, Giovanni di Nicolao&#x27;s first wife Costanza Trenta, who had died perhaps in childbirth by February 1433. In the latter case, this would make the painting partly an unusual memorial portrait, showing one living and one dead person. Details such as the snuffed candle above the woman, the scenes after Christ&#x27;s death on her side of the background roundel, and the black garb of the man, support this view. Both Giovanni di Arrigo and Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini were Italian merchants, originally from Lucca, but resident in Bruges since at least 1419. The man in this painting is the subject of a further portrait by van Eyck in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, leading to speculation he was a friend of the artist.

==Scholarly debate==
In 1934, Erwin Panofsky published an article entitled &quot;Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &#x27;Arnolfini&#x27; Portrait&quot; in the &quot;Burlington Magazine&quot;, arguing that the elaborate signature on the back wall, and other factors, showed that it was painted as a legal record of the occasion of the marriage of the couple, complete with witnesses and a witness signature. Panofsky also argues that the many details of domestic items in the painting each have a disguised symbolism attached to their appearance. While Panofsky&#x27;s claim that the painting formed a kind of certificate of marriage is not accepted by all art historians, his analysis of the symbolic function of the details is broadly agreed, and has been applied to many other Early Netherlandish paintings, especially a number of depictions of the Annunciation set in richly detailed interiors, a tradition for which the &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; and the &quot;Mérode Altarpiece&quot; by Robert Campin represent the start (in terms of surviving works at least).

Since then, there has been considerable scholarly argument among art historians on the occasion represented. Edwin Hall considers that the painting depicts a betrothal, not a marriage. Margaret D. Carroll argues that the painting is a portrait of a married couple that alludes also to the husband&#x27;s grant of legal authority to his wife. Carroll also proposes that the portrait was meant to affirm Giovanni Arnolfini&#x27;s good character as a merchant and aspiring member of the Burgundian court. She argues that the painting depicts a couple, already married, now formalizing a subsequent legal arrangement, a mandate, by which the husband &quot;hands over&quot; to his wife the legal authority to conduct business on her own or his behalf (similar to a power of attorney). The claim is not that the painting had any legal force, but that van Eyck played upon the imagery of legal contract as a pictorial conceit. While the two figures in the mirror could be thought of as witnesses to the oath-taking, the artist himself provides (witty) authentication with his notarial signature on the wall.

Jan Baptist Bedaux agrees somewhat with Panofsky that this is a marriage contract portrait in his 1986 article &quot;The reality of symbols: the question of disguised symbolism in Jan van Eyck&#x27;s Arnolfini Portrait.&quot; However, he disagrees with Panofsky&#x27;s idea of items in the portrait having hidden meanings. Bedaux argues, &quot;if the symbols are disguised to such an extent that they do not clash with reality as conceived at the time ... there will be no means of proving that the painter actually intended such symbolism.&quot; He also conjectures that if these disguised symbols were normal parts of the marriage ritual, then one could not say for sure whether the items were part of a &quot;disguised symbolism&quot; or just social reality.

Craig Harbison takes the middle ground between Panofsky and Bedaux in their debate about &quot;disguised symbolism&quot; and realism. Harbison argues that &quot;Jan van Eyck is there as storyteller ... [who] must have been able to understand that, within the context of people&#x27;s lives, objects could have multiple associations&quot;, and that there are many possible purposes for the portrait and ways it can be interpreted. He maintains that this portrait cannot be fully interpreted until scholars accept the notion that objects can have multiple associations. Harbison urges the notion that one needs to conduct a multivalent reading of the painting that includes references to the secular and sexual context of the Burgundian court, as well as religious and sacramental references to marriage.

Lorne Campbell in the National Gallery Catalogue sees no need to find a special meaning in the painting: &quot;... there seems little reason to believe that the portrait has any significant narrative content. Only the unnecessary lighted candle and the strange signature provoke speculation.&quot; He suggests that the double portrait was very possibly made to commemorate a marriage, but not a legal record and cites examples of miniatures from manuscripts showing similarly elaborate inscriptions on walls as a normal form of decoration at the time. Another portrait in the National Gallery by van Eyck, &quot;Portrait of a Man (Leal Souvenir)&quot;, has a legalistic form of signature.

Margaret Koster&#x27;s new suggestion, discussed above and below, that the portrait is a memorial one, of a wife already dead for a year or so, would displace these theories. Art historian Maximiliaan Martens has suggested that the painting was meant as a gift for the Arnolfini family in Italy. It had the purpose of showing the prosperity and wealth of the couple depicted. He feels this might explain oddities in the painting, for example why the couple are standing in typical winter clothing while a cherry tree is in fruit outside, and why the phrase &quot;Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434&quot; is featured so large in the centre of the painting. Herman Colenbrander has proposed that the painting may depict an old German custom of a husband promising a gift to his bride on the morning after their wedding night. He has also suggested that the painting may have been a present from the artist to his friend.

In 2016, French physician Jean-Philippe Postel, in his book &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Arnolfini&quot;, agreed with Koster that the woman is dead, but he suggested that she is appearing to the man as a spectre, asking him to pray for her soul.

==Interpretation and symbolism==

===Figures and marriage===
It is thought that the couple are already married because of the woman&#x27;s headdress. A non-married woman would have her hair down, according to Margaret Carroll. The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles – the woman stands near the bed and well into the room, symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house and solidifying her in a domestic role, whereas Giovanni stands near the open window, symbolic of his role in the outside world. Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer; his wife gazes obediently at her husband. His hand is vertically raised, representing his commanding position of authority, whilst she has her hand in a lower, horizontal, more submissive pose. However, her gaze at her husband can also show her equality to him because she is not looking down at the floor as lower-class women would. They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal, not his lowly subordinate.

The symbolism behind the action of the couple&#x27;s joined hands has also been debated among scholars. Many point to this gesture as proof of the painting&#x27;s purpose. Is it a marriage contract or something else? Panofsky interprets the gesture as an act of fides, Latin for &quot;marital oath&quot;. He calls the representation of the couple &quot;qui desponsari videbantur per fidem&quot; which means, &quot;who were contracting their marriage by marital oath&quot;. The man is grasping the woman&#x27;s right hand with his left, which is the basis for the controversy. Some scholars like Jan Baptist Bedaux and Peter Schabacker argue that if this painting does show a marriage ceremony, then the use of the left hand points to the marriage being morganatic and not . A marriage is said to be morganatic if a man marries a woman of unequal rank. However, the subjects originally thought by most scholars to be represented in this painting, Giovanni Arnolfini and Giovanna Cenami, were of equal status and rank in the courtly system, so the theory would not hold true. On the opposite side of the debate are scholars like Margaret Carroll. She suggests that the painting deploys the imagery of a contract between an already married couple giving the wife the authority to act on her husband&#x27;s behalf in business dealings. Carroll identifies Arnolfini&#x27;s raised right hand as a gesture of oath-taking known as &quot;&quot;fidem levare&quot;, and his joining hands with his wife as a gesture of consent known as &quot;fides manualis&quot;&quot;.

Although many viewers assume the wife to be pregnant, this is not believed to be so. Art historians point to numerous paintings of female virgin saints similarly dressed, and believe that this look was fashionable for women&#x27;s dresses at the time. Fashion would have been important to Arnolfini, especially since he was a cloth merchant. The more cloth a person wore, the more wealthy he or she was assumed to be. Another indication that the woman is not pregnant is that Giovanna Cenami (the identification of the woman according to most earlier scholars) died childless, as did Costanza Trenta (a possible identification according to recent archival evidence); whether a hypothetical unsuccessful pregnancy would have been left recorded in a portrait is questionable, although if it is indeed Costanza Trenta, as Koster proposed, and she died in childbirth, then the oblique reference to pregnancy gains strength. Moreover, the beauty ideal embodied in contemporary female portraits and clothing rest in the first place on the high valuation on the ability of women to bear children. Harbison maintains her gesture is merely an indication of the extreme desire of the couple shown for fertility and progeny.

There is a carved figure as a finial on the bedpost, probably of Saint Margaret, patron saint of pregnancy and childbirth, who was invoked to assist women in labor and to cure infertility, or possibly representing Saint Martha, the patroness of housewives. From the bedpost hangs a brush, symbolic of domestic duties. Furthermore, the brush and the rock crystal prayer-beads (a popular engagement present from the future bridegroom) appearing together on either side of the mirror may also allude to the dual Christian injunctions &quot;ora et labora&quot; (pray and work). According to Jan Baptist Bedaux, the broom could also symbolize proverbial chastity; it &quot;sweeps out impurities&quot;.

===Mirror===

The small medallions set into the frame of the convex mirror at the back of the room show tiny scenes from the Passion of Christ and may represent God&#x27;s promise of salvation for the figures reflected on the mirror&#x27;s convex surface. Furthering the Memorial theory, all the scenes on the wife&#x27;s side are of Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection. Those on the husband&#x27;s side concern Christ&#x27;s life. The mirror itself may represent the eye of God observing the wedding vows. A spotless mirror was also an established symbol of Mary, referring to the Holy Virgin&#x27;s Immaculate Conception and purity. The mirror reflects two figures in the doorway, one of whom may be the painter himself. In Panofsky&#x27;s controversial view, the figures are shown to prove that the two witnesses required to make a wedding legal were present, and Van Eyck&#x27;s signature on the wall acts as some form of actual documentation of an event at which he was himself present.

According to one author &quot;The painting is often referenced for its immaculate depiction of non-Euclidean geometry&quot;, referring to the image on the convex mirror. Assuming a spherical mirror, the distortion has been correctly portrayed, except for the leftmost part of the window frame, the near edge of the table, and the hem of the dress.

===Other objects===

The little dog may symbolize fidelity (fido), loyalty, or alternatively lust, signifying the couple&#x27;s desire to have a child. Unlike the couple, he looks out to meet the gaze of the viewer. The dog could be simply a lap dog, a gift from husband to wife. Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions, reflecting the wealth of the couple and their position in courtly life. The dog appears to be a Griffon terrier, or perhaps an Affenpinscher.

The green of the woman&#x27;s dress symbolizes hope, possibly the hope of becoming a mother. Its intense brightness also indicates wealth, since dyeing fabric such a shade was difficult and expensive. Her white cap could signify purity or her status as married. Behind the pair, the curtains of the marriage bed have been opened; the red curtains might allude to the physical act of love.

The single candle in the left-front holder of the ornate six-branched chandelier is possibly the candle used in traditional Flemish marriage customs. Lit in full daylight, like the sanctuary lamp in a church, the candle may allude to the presence of the Holy Ghost or the ever-present eye of God. Alternatively, Margaret Koster posits that the painting is a memorial portrait, as the single lit candle on Giovanni&#x27;s side contrasts with the burnt-out candle whose wax stub can just be seen on his wife&#x27;s side, in a visual play on a common metaphor: he lives on, she is dead.

The cherries present on the tree outside the window may symbolize love. The oranges which lie on the window sill and chest may symbolize the purity and innocence that reigned in the Garden of Eden before the Fall of Man. They were uncommon and a sign of wealth in the Netherlands, but in Italy were a symbol of fecundity in marriage. More simply, the fruit could be a sign of the couple&#x27;s wealth, since oranges were very expensive imports. 

The male subject&#x27;s over-shoes, called pattens, were a covering for indoor footwear that were made as protection from the outdoor elements. The idea that he has taken his off may imply that he would no longer stray, hinting at his fidelity towards his wife, potentially signifying that, for religious reasons, he would not remarry after her death. This is further used as proof that the female subject was painted posthumously.

In January 2018 the woman&#x27;s dress was the subject of the BBC Four programme &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot; with fashion historian Amber Butchart.

==Provenance==

The provenance of the painting begins in 1435 when it was dated by van Eyck and presumably owned by the sitter(s). At some point before 1516 it came into the possession of Don Diego de Guevara (d. Brussels 1520), a Spanish career courtier of the Habsburgs (himself the subject of a fine portrait by Michael Sittow in the National Gallery of Art). He lived most of his life in the Netherlands, and may have known the Arnolfinis in their later years.

By 1516 he had given the portrait to Margaret of Austria, Habsburg Regent of the Netherlands, when it shows up as the first item in an inventory of her paintings, made in her presence at Mechelen. The item says (in French): &quot;a large picture which is called Hernoul le Fin with his wife in a chamber, which was given to Madame by Don Diego, whose arms are on the cover of the said picture; done by the painter Johannes.&quot; A note in the margin says &quot;It is necessary to put on a lock to close it: which Madame has ordered to be done.&quot; In a 1523–24 Mechelen inventory, a similar description is given, although this time the name of the subject is given as &quot;Arnoult Fin&quot;.

In 1530 the painting was inherited by Margaret&#x27;s niece Mary of Hungary, who in 1556 went to live in Spain. It is clearly described in an inventory taken after her death in 1558, when it was inherited by Philip II of Spain. A painting of two of his young daughters, &quot;Infantas Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catalina Micaela of Spain&quot; (Prado), commissioned by Philip clearly copies the pose of the figures. In 1599 a German visitor saw it in the Alcazar Palace in Madrid. Now it had verses from Ovid painted on the frame: &quot;See that you promise: what harm is there in promises? In promises anyone can be rich.&quot; It is very likely that Velázquez knew the painting, which may have influenced his , which shows a room in the same palace.
In 1700 the painting appeared in an inventory after the death of Carlos II with shutters and the verses from Ovid.

The painting survived the fire in the Alcazar which destroyed some of the Spanish royal collection, and by 1794 had been moved to the &quot;Palacio Nuevo&quot;, the present Royal Palace of Madrid. In 1816 the painting was in London, in the possession of Colonel James Hay, a Scottish soldier. He claimed that after he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Waterloo the previous year, the painting hung in the room where he convalesced in Brussels. He fell in love with it, and persuaded the owner to sell. More relevant to the real facts is no doubt Hay&#x27;s presence at the Battle of Vitoria (1813) in Spain, where a large coach loaded by King Joseph Bonaparte with easily portable artworks from the royal collections was first plundered by British troops, before what was left was recovered by their commanders and returned to the Spanish.

Hay offered the painting to the Prince Regent, later George IV of the United Kingdom, via Sir Thomas Lawrence. The Prince had it on approval for two years at Carlton House before eventually returning it in 1818. Around 1828, Hay gave it to a friend to look after, not seeing it or the friend for the next thirteen years, until he arranged for it to be included in a public exhibition in 1841. It was bought the following year (1842) by the recently formed National Gallery, London for £600, as inventory number 186, where it remains. By then the shutters had gone, along with the original frame.

<doc id="1036804" wikidata="Q15040615" url="?curid=1036804" title="Harry Golden">
<text>Harry Lewis Golden (May 6, 1902 – October 2, 1981) was an American writer and newspaper publisher.
==Early life==
Golden was born Herschel Goldhirsch (or Goldenhurst) in the shtetl Mikulintsy, Austria-Hungary. His mother Nuchama (nee Klein)
was Romanian and his father Leib was Austrian.

In 1904 Leib Goldhirsch, a former Hebrew teacher, emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, only to move the family to New York City the next year and &quot;became an editor of the Jewish Daily Forward.&quot;

For a time, Harry worked as a newspaper seller on the Lower East Side and could remember shouting out headlines about the Leo Frank case about which he later wrote a book. As a teenager, he became interested in Georgism, and later spoke on its behalf.

He became a stockbroker but lost his job in the 1929 stock market crash. Convicted of mail fraud because he had held onto funds entrusted and thereby caused a loss to investors, Golden served four years in a Federal prison at Atlanta, Georgia and, decades later President Richard M. Nixon gave Golden a full presidential pardon for the mail fraud conviction.

==Desegregation==
In 1941, he moved to Charlotte, where, as a reporter for the &quot;Charlotte Labor Journal&quot; and &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, he wrote about and spoke out against racial segregation and the Jim Crow laws of the time.
From 1942 to 1968, Golden published &quot;The Carolina Israelite&quot; as a forum, not just for his political views but also observations and reminiscences of his boyhood in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. He traveled widely: in 1960 to speak to Jews in West Germany and again to cover the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann in Israel for &quot;Life&quot;. He is referenced in the lyrics to Phil Ochs&#x27; song, &quot;Love Me, I&#x27;m a Liberal&quot;: &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve memorized Lerner and Golden.&quot;

His satirical &quot;The Vertical Negro Plan,&quot; involved removing the chairs from any to-be-integrated building, since Southern whites did not mind standing with blacks such as at bank tellers&#x27; windows, only sitting with them.

Golden reportedly convinced a southern department store manager to put an &quot;Out of Order&quot; sign by the water fountain marked &quot;White&quot;; within three weeks all were drinking from the &quot;Colored&quot;-designated drinking fountain.

Calvin Trillin devised the Harry Golden Rule, which states that &quot;in present-day America it&#x27;s very difficult, when commenting on events of the day, to invent something so bizarre that it might not actually come to pass while your piece is still on the presses.&quot;

Golden&#x27;s books include three collections of essays from the &quot;Israelite&quot; and a biography of his friend, poet Carl Sandburg. One of those collections, &quot;Only in America&quot;, was the basis for a play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. He also maintained a correspondence with Billy Graham.

==Personal==
His Irish Catholic wife, the former Genevieve Gallagher, had predeceased him.

==Critical attention==
Theodore Solotaroff addressed the &quot;Harry Golden phenomenon&quot; in &quot;Harry Golden &amp; the American Audience&quot; in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, March 1961.

Irving Howe compared Philip Roth&#x27;s early novel &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; to &quot;For 2¢ Plain&quot; in a critical review of Roth&#x27;s novel in &quot;Commentary&quot; when &quot;Complaint&quot; was published in 1969.

<doc id="1036805" wikidata="Q721857" url="?curid=1036805" title="Giovanni Arnolfini">
<text>Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini ( – after 1452) was a merchant from Lucca, a city in Tuscany, Italy. He spent most of his life in Flanders, then part of the Duchy of Burgundy, probably always based in Bruges, a wealthy trading city and one of the main towns of the Burgundian court. The Arnolfini were a powerful family in Lucca, involved in the politics and trade of the small but wealthy city, which specialised (like Florence) in weaving expensive cloth.

==Life==
Giovanni, known as &quot;di Nicolao&quot; or &quot;son of Nicolao&quot; to distinguish him from his cousin &quot;Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini&quot; (see below), moved to Bruges in Flanders at an early age to work in the family business and lived there for the rest of his life. He became wealthy trading in silk and other fabrics, tapestries and other precious objects, although in later years he seems to have suffered business reverses, and to have retired from trading. His fame arises because he is the most likely candidate, out of a number of male Arnolfinis, to have been the subject of two portraits by Jan van Eyck, the famous Flemish painter. These are: &quot;The Arnolfini Portrait&quot; of Giovanni and his wife, dated 1434 and now in London, and another portrait, evidently of the same sitter when slightly older, now in Berlin (below). 

He was presumably born in Lucca, where his parents lived, but neither the place nor the date are documented. He was sent to Bruges while still technically a child, as the first record of him is a letter from his father Nicolao in Lucca to his agent in Bruges in 1419 empowering the agent to &quot;emancipate&quot; Giovanni – that is, to declare him adult. Since there was no fixed age for this, it gives no real clue as to his date of birth. 

In the next few years, Giovanni di Nicolao worked with a very successful Italian merchant, Marco Guidiccioni, another Lucchese who was connected to him by marriage. Records of some of his dealings with the Ducal court have survived, but these were probably only part of his business activities. In 1422 he tried to sell a valuable gold collar to King Henry V of England, and in 1423 he sold Duke Phillip the Good six tapestries of scenes from the Life of the Virgin, which the Duke gave to the Pope. Other sales to the Court are recorded, although he may have been acting on behalf of Guidiccioni. 
In 1426 he married Costanza Trenta, who is at first sight not the wife in the portrait, as a letter by her mother of 26 February 1433 mentions that she had died. She was also from Lucca, and her aunt Ginevra Cavalcanti was married to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, brother of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. On the other hand, Margaret Koster has recently proposed that the double portrait may be a memorial one, including an image of Costanza, but painted a year after her death. 

In 1442 he signed an agreement whereby, for a moderate fee, he became a burgess of Bruges after promising not to trade as a merchant. He was permitted to practise &quot;the small burgess&#x27;s crafts&quot;, but whether he ever did is unknown. In 1446 and 1452 he is documented as an arbitrator in disputes between other Lucchese merchants (in 1446 including his cousin Giovanni) over property; these are his last appearances in the documentary record. The double portrait remained in Flanders (see the Provenance section in that article), which suggests that Giovanni died there. He was referred to as &quot;Hernoul-le-Fin&quot; in the first inventory record of the double portrait.

A slightly younger first cousin of Giovanni called Giovanni de Arrigo Arnolfini (or &quot;Jehan Arnoulphin le jeune&quot; by the Burgundian accountants), also came to live in Bruges and was even more successful than Giovanni de Nicolao. Giovanni de Arrigo Arnolfini married, and was survived by, Giovanna (Jeanne) Cenami, and they were the couple thought to be the shown in the &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; from 1861 until 1994, when a French naval historian, Jacques Paviot, discovered in the Ducal accounts that the Duke had in 1447 presented two silver pots to &quot;Jehan Arnoulphin&quot; on his marriage – by this time Van Eyck had been dead for six years. Jane or Jeanne Arnolfini is documented further until her death in Bruges in 1480. A further two Arnolfinis, each a younger brother of one of the two Giovannis, are possible candidates as the subject of the Van Eyck portraits, as they lived in, or passed through, Bruges; but neither was apparently there in 1434.

<doc id="1036809" wikidata="Q75930" url="?curid=1036809" title="Nikolaus Storch">
<text>Nikolaus Storch (born pre-1500, died after 1536) was a German weaver and radical lay-preacher in the Saxon town of Zwickau. He and his followers, known as the Zwickau Prophets, played a brief role during the early German Reformation years in south-east Saxony, and there is a view that he was a forerunner of the Anabaptists. In the years 1520–1521, he worked closely with the radical theologian Thomas Müntzer.

==Weaver and lay preacher==
Very little is known about the life of Storch. There are no data about his place or date of birth, but he is assumed to be a native of Zwickau itself. His activities both in and away from Zwickau are not well-documented. He left no letters or other writings. He was a weaver by trade, but it is not known whether he was an apprentice or a master-weaver. Zwickau, at that time a town of around 7,000 inhabitants, was a prosperous town with a significant cloth trade, with the burgeoning silver-mining operations in the surrounding Ore Mountains. The influx of wealth from the mines meant that several local master-weavers had the capacity to break smaller competitors. This introduced volatile social and economic relationships into the town. The weavers&#x27; religious organisation in Zwickau – the &quot;Fronleichnams-Bruderschaft&quot; or &#x27;Brotherhood of Corpus Christi&#x27; – had an altar at the church of St. Catherine in the town.

Prior to 1520, a splinter group broke away from this guild under Storch&#x27;s leadership, a sect whose members believed that the source of true Christian belief came through visions and dreams. Storch was remarkably well-read in the Bible, having been taught by Balthasar Teufel, one-time schoolmaster of Zwickau. Storch had made several trips to Bohemia in the line of business, and there had come under the influence of the Taborites of Žatec (Saaz). In Zwickau he conducted &#x27;corner sermons&#x27; in the houses of other weavers. The town chronicler Peter Schumann thought of Storch as &#x27;someone with a profound knowledge of Scripture and expert in the things of the Spirit&#x27; 

==Working with Thomas Müntzer==

When the radical reformer Thomas Müntzer was appointed to preach at St. Catherine&#x27;s Church, in October 1520, after a short period at the neighbouring St Mary&#x27;s, he and Storch began to work together. Müntzer was greatly interested in Storch&#x27;s doctrines, although he viewed Storch as a like-minded individual, rather than a follower or someone to follow. During the winter of 1520–21, tensions in the town ran high between Catholics and reformers, plebeians and richer citizens, sects and town-council. A number of disturbances took place in the town, usually involving the lower classes and frequently resulting in acts of violence against the Catholic monks.

On 14 April 1521, a &#x27;Letter of the 12 Apostles and 72 Disciples&#x27; was posted up in the town, addressed to the Lutheran/Humanist reformer Johann Sylvanus Egranus, who had crossed swords with Müntzer and Storch on several occasions already. Egranus was described now as the &quot;desecrator and slanderer of God ... who hounds God&#x27;s servant ... a heretical rogue&quot;. The letter was almost certainly the work of Storch&#x27;s group, but it defended both Storch and Müntzer jointly. It enumerated, in verse, all the false doctrines of Egranus, his denial of the suffering of the soul, his worship of the ‘world’ and of money, and his preference for the company of &#x27;bigwigs&#x27; :
 &quot;And you seek mere chattles, cash and praise,
 But that’s the last thing you&#x27;ll get from the 72 Disciples,
 And just watch what you&#x27;ll get from the 12 Apostles,
 And then even more from the Master...
 And we want to prove in writing that you&#x27;re an arch-heretic&quot;
In a defamatory letter of that same month, Müntzer was depicted thus: “at that time preacher at St Katharine’s, [he] made them [the Storchites] his supporters, won over the weavers, particularly one named Nichol Storch, whom he praised so mightily from the pulpit, raised him above all other priests as the only one who knew the Bible better and who was highly favoured by the Spirit...that Storch dared to give corner-sermons beside Thomas... Thus this Nichol Storch was favoured by Master Thomas; who recommended from the pulpit that laymen should be our prelates and priests”. Although this same report talked of the &#x27;Storchite sect&#x27;, there is no indication that this included Müntzer: indeed, the report states that the &#x27;secta Storchitorum ... conspired and gathered together as Twelve Apostles and Seventy-Two other Disciples ... reinforced by Master Thomas and his followers&#x27;, which strongly suggests that there were two separate groupings.

In the event, the town-council retained enough authority in April to crack down on the unrest. Müntzer was forced to flee the town on 16 April, after yet another riot by Storch&#x27;s supporters, 56 of whom were put behind bars.

One of Müntzer&#x27;s friends, Markus Stübner (or Thoma) of Elsterberg, accompanied Müntzer on a journey to Prague, which lasted from late June until late November 1521; Stübner then returned to Saxony and teamed up with Storch.

After his departure from Zwickau in April 1521, Müntzer had no more dealings with Storch. In June 1521, he wrote to Mark Stübner wondering why Storch had not written to him. But his question is not shaded with any annoyance. His only other reference to Storch in later days was in a letter to Luther of July 1523: &quot;You raise objections about Markus and Nicholas. What manner of men they are is up to them, Galatians 2... As to what they said to you, or what they have done, I know nothing about it&quot;. &#x27;Galatians 2&#x27; is a quite telling reference: this tells the story of certain early Christians who, through lack of principle, drew back from arguments with the Jews. This judgement in 1523 indicates his doubts about Storch in the intervening period, and – with the man – his ideas.

==Wittenberg==

After the events of April, an uneasy peace settled over Zwickau which lasted until the end of the year. But in early December, the town-council summoned Storch and other members of his group to a hearing. The result of this being unfavourable, Storch left town. Nothing daunted, in mid-December 1521, he, along with Markus Stübner and Thomas Drechsel, turned up in Wittenberg to argue their interpretation of the reforms before the &#x27;official&#x27; leaders. Luther was sitting at that time in the Wartburg Castle, whither he was spirited in April 1521 after the Imperial Diet at Worms, so it was left to his lieutenant Philipp Melanchthon and Nikolaus von Amsdorf to greet and debate with Storch, specifically on visions and baptism. Melanchthon&#x27;s immediate reaction was one of excitement, a feeling shared by several of his colleagues. However, caution reared its head, and he decided to seek advice from Electoral Prince Friedrich and from Luther. To Prince Friedrich he wrote on 27 December: “Your Highness is aware that many, various and dangerous dissensions have been awoken in Your Highness’ Zwickau... Three men, expelled by the authorities because of those disturbances, have come here, two of them common but literate weavers, the third an academic [Stübner]. I have listened to them; it is a wonder, but they sat down to preach, and said clearly that they had been sent by God to teach, that they spoke familiarly with God, that they could see the future; in short that they were prophets and apostles. How much I was moved by them, I cannot easily express. Certain things persuade me not to condemn them... No one other than Martin can judge them more closely...” 

In a covering note to Friedrich’s chaplain, Georg Spalatin, Melanchthon added: &quot;The Holy Spirit is in these men...&quot; The reaction of this leader of the Wittenberg movement was quite surprising; anyone without university training or a theological education was generally given short shrift; in later years, most unordained reformed preachers were regarded as &#x27;Anabaptists&#x27;. But in the last months of 1521, radicalism was rampant, and Wittenberg was open to suggestion.

Prince Friedrich&#x27;s reaction to Melanchthon&#x27;s letter was to despatch Spalatin to Wittenberg post-haste to interview the three ‘Zwickau Prophets’, and to warn Melanchthon against Storch, whereupon Melanchthon changed his tune, and expressed an interest only in the question of baptism.

==Later life==
Storch stayed for a while in Wittenberg and then moved on. It is suggested that he spent some years in the west of Thuringia, and Luther reported that he was active in Andreas Karlstadt&#x27;s town of Orlamünde in March 1524. A warning was issued by the Nuremberg preacher Dominicus Sleupner to the Strasburg town-council who stated that Storch was in their town in December 1524. However, none of these three reports have been validated.

According to the chronicler Enoch Widmann, Storch was in the Bavarian town of Hof at the end of 1524, working as a weaver, but still preaching and gaining followers. Towards the end of January 1525, he applied to the mayor of Zwickau to be allowed to return to his home-town, but this was refused. There is a false report of his death in Munich at the end of 1525, but he was still being mentioned in the Zwickau town records of 1536 – therefore alive, and back in or around Zwickau. After that date, there is no further report of him.

==Doctrines==
A summary of Storch&#x27;s teachings in Zwickau was made in a letter, dated 18 December 1521, to Duke John of Saxony. The letter was probably written by the new Lutheran preacher at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Nikolaus Hausmann: &quot;some men doubted whether the belief of the godfather can be of use in the baptism. And some think that they can be blessed without being baptised. And some state that the Holy Bible is not useful in the education of men, but that men can only be taught by the Spirit, for if God had wanted to teach men with the Bible, then He would have sent us a Bible down from heaven. And some say that one should not pray for the dead. And suchlike horrible abominations which are giving your Lordship&#x27;s town an unchristian and Picardish name.&quot;

In 1529, Melanchthon looked back to 1521 and described Storch&#x27;s doctrines: &quot;God had shown him in dreams what He wanted. He claimed that an angel had come to him and had said that he would sit upon the throne of the Archangel Gabriel, and would thus be promised mastery over all the earth. He also said that saints and the Elect would reign after the destruction of the Godless, and that, under his leadership, all the kings and princes of the world would be killed and the Church would be cleansed. He arrogated to himself the judgment of souls, and claimed that he could recognise the Elect. He simply laughed about Mass, baptism and communion. He invented certain worthless tricks with which he intended to prepare men for the reception of the Spirit: if they spoke little, dressed poorly and ate poorly and together demanded the Holy Spirit of God...&quot;

The Lutheran Mark Wagner listed eight articles of faith proposed by Storch, which included: a condemnation of the ‘Christian’ institution of marriage, whilst propagating the idea that ‘anyone can take women whenever his flesh commands him...and live with them promiscuously as he wishes’; a call for the communalisation of property; an invective against secular and ecclesiastical authorities; arguments against infant baptism - but not, incidentally, in support of adult baptism; condemnation of the ceremonies of the Church; and a proclamation of Free Will in matters of faith.

==Legacy==
In general, Storch was considered by commentators of the 16th century as a leading ‘Anabaptist’. However, there was a tendency to call almost any radical preacher an Anabaptist, with hindsight only and without distinction. Such classification therefore needs to be treated with caution.
He is credited with having established Anabaptism in central Germany, after the report by the Hof chronicler Widmann that he practised adult-baptism in the town of Hof.

He is also credited by Melanchthon (in a letter to Camerarius, 17 April 1525) with having played a leading role in the Peasants War of 1525. This supposition is entirely without foundation, and probably reflects Melanchthon&#x27;s continuing guilt about his waverings in 1521.

<text>This glossary of nautical terms is an alphabetical listing of terms and expressions connected with ships, shipping, seamanship and navigation on water (mostly though not necessarily on the sea). Some remain current, while many date from the 17th to 19th centuries. The word nautical derives from the Latin &quot;nauticus&quot;, from Greek &quot;nautikos&quot;, from &quot;nautēs&quot;: &quot;sailor&quot;, from &quot;naus&quot;: &quot;ship&quot;.

Further information on nautical terminology may also be found at Nautical metaphors in English, and additional military terms are listed in the Multiservice tactical brevity code article. Terms used in other fields associated with bodies of water can be found at Glossary of fishery terms, Glossary of underwater diving terminology, Glossary of rowing terms, and Glossary of meteorology.

<text>A strong element in contemporary Canadian culture is rich, diverse, thoughtful and witty science fiction.

==History of Canadian science fiction==
The first recorded Canadian works of science fiction or proto-science fiction include Napoléon Aubin&#x27;s unfinished serial, &quot;Mon Voyage à la Lune&quot;, a satirical Moon voyage published in 1839, and James De Mille&#x27;s novel, &quot;A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder&quot;, published posthumously in 1888.

Another early instance is the 1896 work &quot;Tisab Ting, or, The Electrical Kiss&quot;, a pseudonymous first novel by an Ida May Ferguson of New Brunswick under the pseudonym &quot;Dyjan Fergus&quot;. Set in late 20th century Montreal, it features an &quot;electrical genius&quot;: a &quot;learned Chinaman&quot; who woos and wins a Canadian wife through his superior scientific knowledge as embodied in &quot;the Electrical Kiss&quot;. It is of interest mainly because of its early publication date and female authorship; a microfiche reprint was issued in 1980.

In 1948, the 6th World Science Fiction Convention, also called Torcon, was held in Toronto. Although it was organized by members of a local science fiction fandom group called &quot;The Derelicts&quot; and chaired by local fan Edward &quot;Ned&quot; McKeown, the Guests of Honor, Robert Bloch (pro) and Bob Tucker (fan), were both Americans. Among those in attendance were Forrest J Ackerman, Bloch, Leslie A. Croutch, E. Everett Evans, James &quot;Rusty&quot; Hevelin, David H. Keller, Judith Merril, Sam Moskowitz, Chad Oliver, George O. Smith, Will Sykora, Tucker, and Donald Wollheim.

Like many aspects of Canadian culture, Canadian science fiction emerged from a variety of isolated sources, including A. E. van Vogt, the fantasy works of John Buchan, the poetry of Phyllis Gotlieb, and a handful of other writers. In the late 20th century, political upheaval in the United States brought such talents as Spider Robinson and Judith Merril to Canada.

In 1973, the World Science Fiction Convention was held again in Toronto, bringing a new generation of interest to writers like Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. This led to a range of activities and interest in the genre. Merril began hosting quarterly gatherings of authors in a loose group called &quot;Toronto Hydra&quot;, a tradition she had brought from the New York SF community. In 1977, the Ottawa Science Fiction Society was founded, providing a venue for writers such as Charles R. Saunders and Charles de Lint through their club fanzine &quot;Stardock&quot;, as well as sponsoring Maplecon in its early years.

In the early 1980s, the Ontario Science Fiction Club was set up by Robert J. Sawyer, while the Bunch of Seven became the first known science fiction writing circle in Canada, helping the success of authors like S. M. Stirling and Tanya Huff, which later led to the Cecil Street Irregulars which included writers like Cory Doctorow. De Lint, Huff and Guy Gavriel Kay became notable for using Canadian settings in science fiction and fantasy, and William Gibson pioneered the cyberpunk subgenre with his novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;.

In Quebec, Élisabeth Vonarburg and other authors developed a related tradition of French-Canadian SF. The Prix Boreal was established in 1979 to honour Canadian science fiction works in French. The Prix Aurora Awards (briefly preceded by the Casper Award) were founded in 1980 to recognize and promote the best works of Canadian science fiction in both French and English.

Regular annual science fiction conventions, notably Ad Astra, brought fans and writers together to further broaden awareness and appreciation of science fiction literature in Canada.

By the 1990s, Canadian science fiction was well established and internationally recognized; mainstream authors such as Margaret Atwood began including SF in their repertoire.

SF Canada, Canada&#x27;s National Association of Speculative Fiction Professionals, was established in 1992.

==Canadian science fiction authors==
Some of the most famous Canadian writers of science fiction include Margaret Atwood, John Clute, Charles de Lint, Cory Doctorow, James Alan Gardner, William Gibson, Ed Greenwood, Tanya Huff, H. L. Gold, Nalo Hopkinson, Guy Gavriel Kay, Judith Merril, Spider Robinson, Robert J. Sawyer, Karl Schroeder, Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, A. E. van Vogt, and Robert Charles Wilson.

==Canadian science fiction in film and television==
The Canadian Broadcasting Company began producing science fiction as early as the 1950s. CTV produced &quot;The Starlost&quot; at the CFTO studios in Scarborough. In the early 1990s, Toronto and Vancouver became prominent centres of television and film production, with shows like &quot;Forever Knight&quot; and &quot;RoboCop&quot;, then &quot;The X-Files&quot; raised the profile of Canadian science fiction television much higher, although only &quot;Forever Knight&quot; was itself set in Canada. By the late 1990s, a significant fraction of science fiction and fantasy on television was produced in Canada. In the early 2000s, due to changes in tax laws, production companies shifted much of their operations from Toronto to Vancouver.

Some of the most popular science fiction movies and TV shows seen around the world are made primarily or entirely in Vancouver &amp; Toronto which are both often called Hollywood North, or elsewhere in Canada. Quebec produces shows in French. Canadian studios also produced a large volume of animation, notably specializing in 3D animation.

Canadian science fiction films of note include:
* &quot;eXistenZ&quot;
* &quot;Cube&quot;
* &quot;Nothing&quot;
* &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;
* &quot;Scanners&quot;
* &quot;Screamers&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Last Night&quot;

==Awards==
* Aurora Awards—Canadian science fiction novels (English and French), administered by the Canadian Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Association
* Prix Boréal - Canadian science fiction awards for works in French
* Sunburst Awards - annual juried award for Canadian speculative fiction novel in two categories: adult and young adult
* Constellation Awards - given to actors, writers, and technical artists for excellence in science fiction film and television, as selected by the Canadian viewing public

<text>&quot;The Bazaar&quot; is a song by Canadian rock band The Tea Party. It was released as a promotional single in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and the USA. The music video was shot in Istanbul, and its Grand Bazaar. An acoustic version was recorded also and released on Alhambra as &quot;The Grand Bazaar&quot;.

&quot;The Bazaar&quot; is a standard three-piece rock song with an introduction composed of harmonium and goblet drums. Jeff Burrows described the song as fusing &quot;the exotic with heavier rock side of the band better than any other song&quot;.

The song has been covered by the symphonic metal band Hollenthon as a bonus track on their 2008 album, &quot;Opus Magnum&quot;.

<text>The [[Bayreuth]] Circle (German: &quot;Der Bayreuther Kreis&quot;) was a name originally applied by some writers to devotees of Richard Wagner&#x27;s music who attended and supported the annual Bayreuth Festival in the later 19th and early twentieth centuries. As some of these devotees espoused nationalistic German politics, and some of them were supporters of Adolf Hitler from the 1920s onwards, this group of people has been associated by some writers with the rise of Nazism. 

==History==
The term &#x27;Bayreuth Circle&#x27; was originally applied to the enthusiasts of Wagner&#x27;s music who were also associated with or subscribed to the publication &quot;Bayreuther Blätter&quot;, established in the 1880s by Wagner himself and edited by Hans von Wolzogen. This journal, apart from containing snippets by Wagner himself on social, political and aesthetic matters, was also strongly nationalistic and anti-Semitic. Its circulation was small and it was not politically influential.

After the death of Wagner in 1883, his second wife Cosima, in continuing to propagate what she saw as her husband&#x27;s views, was supported by a number of active anti-Semites, including Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Ludwig Schemann. Schemann, the founder of the German Gobineau Society, &#x27;did a great deal to bring Gobineau&#x27;s term &#x27;Aryan&#x27; into vogue amongst German racists&#x27;. Chamberlain (d. 1927), who wrote an influential anti-Semitic book, &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, &quot;married Eva Wagner, daughter of the composer.

==Assertions of political influence==
There never was any organisation named the &#x27;Bayreuth Circle&#x27; or any group of people who identified themselves by that name, but the term has been used by some historians from about the 1960s onwards as a convenient label for Hitler supporters associated with Bayreuth. Examples of such association are given in the following citations. 

:&quot;Only with timely support from the Bayreuth circle, especially Houston S. Chamberlain, Winifred Wagner, and henchmen like Dietrich Eckhart in the Thule Society, could the unimpressive Hitler assume the self- then public image of a Wotan/Siegfried figure, complete with telling nickname: &quot;Wolf.&quot; &quot; 

:&quot;Thus Hitler himself admitted: `It was Cosima Wagner&#x27;s merit to have created the link between Bayreuth and National Socialism&#x27;. It was the Bayreuth circle which raised Wagner&#x27;s message to the status of gospel, manoeuvring his ideas into a Germanic-Christian doctrine of salvation.&quot;

Strong on assertion, such statements are void of supporting evidence: it should be borne in mind that Eckhardt died in 1923, Chamberlain was dead in 1927, and Cosima Wagner in 1930, i.e. before the first political victory of the Nazi party in the September 1930 elections. Whilst these personages were (or would have been) undoubtedly supporters of Hitler, they played little or no part, and had no influence, in his climb to power. These citations also make the typical, and unsubstantiated, assumption of many modern historians that the German people in general (or even active Nazis in particular) knew, or cared, anything at all about Wagner or his operas.

Evidence for any political active role played by a &#x27;Bayreuth Circle&#x27; as a group is therefore highly contentious.

==Personalities cited as members==
Amongst those often listed as &#x27;members&#x27; of a Hitlerian Bayreuth Circle are Cosima Wagner (d. 1930), second wife of the composer, Winifred Wagner, wife of the composer&#x27;s son Siegfried, and H. S. Chamberlain. None of the Wagners, however, played any personally active role in the Nazi movement, although Hitler was undoubtedly influenced by Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot;. Chamberlain himself joined the Nazi Party and contributed to its publications. The Nazi journal &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; dedicated five columns to praising him on his 70th birthday, describing &quot;Foundations&quot; as the &quot;gospel of the Nazi movement&quot;. Hitler later attended Chamberlain&#x27;s funeral in January, 1927 along with several highly ranked members of the Nazi party. Other members of the putative &#x27;Circle&#x27;, such as Winifred Wagner, were sycophants of Hitler, partly from political sympathy, partly in the hopes of obtaining advantages (including financial support) for the Bayreuth Festival. There is however no evidence that the actions of either Chamberlain or Winifred Wagner - or others associated with Bayreuth - led Hitler to power or had any influence over him once he obtained it.

==Bayreuth and Nazi appropriation of German culture==
Later in the Nazi era, as part of the regime&#x27;s propaganda intentions of &#x27;Nazifying&#x27; German culture, specific attempts were made to appropriate Wagner&#x27;s music as &#x27;Nazi&#x27; and pseudo-academic articles appeared such as Paul Bulow&#x27;s &quot;Adolf Hitler and the Bayreuth Ideological Circle&quot; (Zeitschrift fur Musik, July 1933). Such articles, as pointed out by cultural historian Frederic Spotts, were Nazi attempts to rewrite history to demonstrate that Hitler was integral to German culture. Modern writers who assert any political or social significance to the &#x27;Bayreuth circle&#x27; risk falling into the traps thus set by Nazi ideologues.

<doc id="1036847" wikidata="Q463126" url="?curid=1036847" title="Coriolanus">
<text>Coriolanus ( or ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1605 and 1608. The play is based on the life of the legendary Roman leader Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus. Shakespeare worked on it during the same years he wrote &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, making them his last two tragedies.

Coriolanus is the name given to a Roman general after his military feats against the Volscians at Corioli. Following his success, others encourage Coriolanus to pursue the consulship, but his disdain for the plebeians and mutual hostility with the tribunes lead to his banishment from Rome. In exile, he presents himself to the Volscians, then leads them against Rome. After he relents and agrees to a peace with Rome, he is killed by his previous Volscian allies.

==Synopsis==
The play opens in Rome shortly after the expulsion of the Tarquin kings. There are riots in progress after stores of grain have been withheld from ordinary citizens. The rioters are particularly angry at Caius Marcius, a brilliant Roman general whom they blame for the loss of their grain. The rioters encounter a patrician named Menenius Agrippa, as well as Caius Marcius himself. Menenius tries to calm the rioters, while Marcius is openly contemptuous, and says that the plebeians are not worthy of the grain because of their lack of military service. Two of the tribunes of Rome, Brutus and Sicinius, privately denounce Marcius. Marcius leaves Rome after news arrives that a Volscian army is in the field.

The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius, has fought Marcius on several occasions and considers him a blood enemy. The Roman army is commanded by Cominius, with Marcius as his deputy. While Cominius takes his soldiers to meet Aufidius&#x27;s army, Marcius rallies Roman troops in front of the Volscian city of Corioli. The siege of Corioli is initially unsuccessful, but the Romans conquer it when Marcius is able to force open the gates of the city. Even though he is exhausted from the fighting, Marcius marches quickly to join Cominius and fight the other Volscian forces. Marcius and Aufidius meet in single combat, fighting until Aufidius&#x27;s own soldiers drag him away from the battle.
In recognition of his great courage, Cominius gives Caius Marcius the agnomen, or &quot;official nickname&quot;, of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. When they return to Rome, Coriolanus&#x27;s mother Volumnia encourages her son to run for consul. Coriolanus is hesitant to do this, but he bows to his mother&#x27;s wishes. He effortlessly wins the support of the Roman Senate, and seems at first to have won over the plebeians as well. However, Brutus and Sicinius scheme to defeat Coriolanus and instigate another plebeian riot in opposition to his becoming consul. Faced with this opposition, Coriolanus flies into a rage and rails against the concept of popular rule. He compares allowing plebeians to have power over the patricians to allowing &quot;crows to peck the eagles&quot;. The two tribunes condemn Coriolanus as a traitor for his words and order him to be banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who banishes Rome from his presence.

After his exile from Rome, Coriolanus makes his way to the Volscian capital of Antium, and asks Aufidius&#x27;s help to wreak revenge upon Rome for banishing him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus, allowing him to lead a new assault on Rome.

Rome, in its panic, tries desperately to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance, but both Cominius and Menenius fail. Finally, Volumnia is sent to meet her son, along with Coriolanus&#x27;s wife Virgilia and their child, and the chaste gentlewoman Valeria. Volumnia succeeds in dissuading her son from destroying Rome, urging him instead to clear his name by reconciling the Volscians with the Romans and creating peace.

Coriolanus concludes a peace treaty between the Volscians and the Romans. When he returns to the Volscian capital, conspirators, organised by Aufidius, kill him for his betrayal.

==Sources==

&quot;Coriolanus&quot; is largely based on the &quot;Life of Coriolanus&quot; in Thomas North&#x27;s translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans&quot; (1579). The wording of Menenius&#x27;s speech about the body politic is derived from William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Remaines of a Greater Worke Concerning Britaine&quot; (1605), where Pope Adrian IV compares a well-run government to a body in which &quot;all parts performed their functions, only the stomach lay idle and consumed all&quot;; the fable is also alluded to in John of Salisbury&#x27;s &quot;Policraticus&quot; (Camden&#x27;s source) and William Averell&#x27;s &quot;A Marvailous Combat of Contrarieties&quot; (1588).

Other sources have been suggested, but are less certain. Shakespeare might also have drawn on Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab Urbe condita&quot;, as translated by Philemon Holland, and possibly a digest of Livy by Lucius Annaeus Florus; both of these were commonly used texts in Elizabethan schools. Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot; were available in manuscript translations, and could also have been used by Shakespeare. He might also have made use of Plutarch&#x27;s original source, the &quot;Roman Antiquities of Dionysius of Halicarnassus&quot;, as well as on his own knowledge of Roman custom and law.

==Date and text==
Most scholars date &quot;Coriolanus&quot; to the period 1605–10, with 1608–09 being considered the most likely, although the available evidence does not permit great certainty.

The earliest date for the play rests on the fact that Menenius&#x27;s fable of the belly is derived from William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Remaines&quot;, published in 1605. The later date derives from the fact that several other texts from 1610 or thereabouts seem to allude to &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, including Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epicoene&quot;, Robert Armin&#x27;s &quot;Phantasma&quot; and John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Prize, or the Tamer Tamed&quot;.

Some scholars note evidence that may narrow down the dating to the period 1607–09. One line may be inspired by George Chapman&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; (late 1608). References to &quot;the coal of fire upon the ice&quot; (I.i) and to squabbles over ownership of channels of water (III.i) could be inspired by Thomas Dekker&#x27;s description of the freezing of the Thames in 1607–08 and Hugh Myddleton&#x27;s project to bring water to London by channels in 1608–09 respectively. Another possible connection with 1608 is that the surviving text of the play is divided into acts; this suggests that it could have been written for the indoor Blackfriars Theatre, at which Shakespeare&#x27;s company began to perform in 1608, although the act-breaks could instead have been introduced later.

The play&#x27;s themes of popular discontent with government have been connected by scholars with the Midland Revolt, a series of peasant riots in 1607 that would have affected Shakespeare as an owner of land in Stratford-upon-Avon; and the debates over the charter for the City of London, which Shakespeare would have been aware of, as it affected the legal status of the area surrounding the Blackfriars Theatre. The riots in the Midlands were caused by hunger because of the enclosure of common land.

For these reasons, R.B. Parker suggests &quot;late 1608 ... to early 1609&quot; as the likeliest date of composition, while Lee Bliss suggests composition by late 1608, and the first public performances in &quot;late December 1609 or February 1610&quot;. Parker acknowledges that the evidence is &quot;scanty ... and mostly inferential&quot;.

The play was first published in the First Folio of 1623. Elements of the text, such as the uncommonly detailed stage directions, lead some Shakespeare scholars to believe the text was prepared from a theatrical prompt book.

==Analysis and criticism==

A. C. Bradley described this play as &quot;built on the grand scale,&quot; like &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Macbeth,&quot; but it differs from those two masterpieces in an important way. The warrior Coriolanus is perhaps the most opaque of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragic heroes, rarely pausing to soliloquise or reveal the motives behind his proud isolation from Roman society. In this way, he is less like the effervescent and reflective Shakespearean heroes/heroines such as Macbeth, Hamlet, Lear and Cleopatra, and more like figures from ancient classical literature such as Achilles, Odysseus, and Aeneas—or, to turn to literary creations from Shakespeare&#x27;s time, the Marlovian conqueror Tamburlaine, whose militaristic pride finds its parallel in Coriolanus. Readers and playgoers have often found him an unsympathetic character, as his caustic pride is strangely, almost delicately balanced at times by a reluctance to be praised by his compatriots and an unwillingness to exploit and slander for political gain. His dislike of being praised might be seen as an expression of his pride; all he cares about is his own self-image, whereas acceptance of praise might imply that his value is affected by others&#x27; opinion of him. The play is less frequently produced than the other tragedies of the later period, and is not so universally regarded as great. (Bradley, for instance, declined to number it among his famous four in the landmark critical work &quot;Shakespearean Tragedy.&quot;) In his book &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Language&quot;, Frank Kermode described &quot;Coriolanus&quot; as &quot;probably the most fiercely and ingeniously planned and expressed of all the tragedies&quot;.

T. S. Eliot famously proclaimed &quot;Coriolanus&quot; superior to &quot;Hamlet&quot; in &quot;The Sacred Wood&quot;, in which he calls the former play, along with &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, the Bard&#x27;s greatest tragic achievement. Eliot wrote a two-part poem about Coriolanus, &quot;Coriolan&quot; (an alternative spelling of Coriolanus); he also alluded to &quot;Coriolanus&quot; in a passage from his own &quot;The Waste Land&quot; when he wrote, &quot;Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus.&quot;

&quot;Coriolanus&quot; has the distinction of being among the few Shakespeare plays banned in a democracy in modern times. It was briefly suppressed in France in the late 1930s because of its use by the fascist element, and Slavoj Žižek noted its prohibition in Post-War Germany due to its intense militarism.

==Performance history==

Like some of Shakespeare&#x27;s other plays (&quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;; &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;; &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;), there is no recorded performance of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; prior to the Restoration. After 1660, however, its themes made it a natural choice for times of political turmoil. The first known performance was Nahum Tate&#x27;s bloody 1682 adaptation at Drury Lane. Seemingly undeterred by the earlier suppression of his &quot;Richard II&quot;, Tate offered a &quot;Coriolanus&quot; that was faithful to Shakespeare through four acts before becoming a Websterian bloodbath in the fifth act. A later adaptation, John Dennis&#x27;s &quot;The Invader of His Country, or The Fatal Resentment&quot;, was booed off the stage after three performances in 1719. The title and date indicate Dennis&#x27;s intent, a vitriolic attack on the Jacobite &#x27;Fifteen. (Similar intentions motivated James Thomson&#x27;s 1745 version, though this bears only a very slight resemblance to Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Its principal connection to Shakespeare is indirect; Thomas Sheridan&#x27;s 1752 production at Smock Alley used some passages of Thomson&#x27;s. David Garrick returned to Shakespeare&#x27;s text in a 1754 Drury Lane production.

Laurence Olivier first played the part at The Old Vic in 1937 and again at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1959. In that production, he performed Coriolanus&#x27;s death scene by dropping backwards from a high platform and being suspended upside-down without the aid of wires.

In 1971, the play returned to the Old Vic in a National Theatre production directed by Manfred Wekwerth and Joachim Tenschert with stage design by Karl von Appen. Anthony Hopkins played Coriolanus, with Constance Cummings as Volumnia and Anna Carteret as Virgilia.

Other performances of Coriolanus include Alan Howard, Paul Scofield, Ian McKellen, Ian Richardson, Tommy Lee Jones, Toby Stephens, Robert Ryan, Christopher Walken, Morgan Freeman, Colm Feore, Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hiddleston and David Oyelowo.

In 2012, National Theatre Wales produced a composite of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot; with Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Coriolan&quot;, entitled Coriolan/us, in a disused hangar at MOD St Athan. Directed by Mike Brookes and Mike Pearson, the production used silent disco headsets to permit the text to be heard while the dramatic action moved throughout the large space. The production was well received by critics.

In December 2013, Donmar Warehouse opened their new production. It was directed by Josie Rourke, starring Tom Hiddleston in the title role, along with Mark Gatiss, Deborah Findlay, Hadley Fraser, and Birgitte Hjort Sørensen. The production received very strong reviews. Michael Billington with &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;A fast, witty, intelligent production that, in Tom Hiddleston, boasts a fine Coriolanus.&quot; He also credited Mark Gatiss as excellent as Menenius, the &quot;humorous patrician&quot;. In &quot;Variety&quot;, David Benedict wrote that Deborah Findlay in her commanding maternal pride, held beautifully in opposition by Birgitte Hjort Sørensen as Coriolanus&#x27;s wife Virgilia. Helen Lewis, in her review of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, along with two other concurrently running sold-out Shakespeare productions with celebrity leads—David Tennant&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; and Jude Law&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;—concludes &quot;if you can beg, borrow or plunder a ticket to one of these plays, let it be &quot;Coriolanus&quot;.&quot; The play was broadcast in cinemas in the UK and internationally on 30 January 2014 as part of the National Theatre Live programme.

==Adaptations==
Bertolt Brecht adapted Shakespeare&#x27;s play in 1952–55, as &quot;Coriolan&quot; for the Berliner Ensemble. He intended to make it a tragedy of the workers, not the individual, and introduce the alienation effect; his journal notes showing that he found many of his own effects already in the text, he considered staging the play with only minimal changes. The adaptation was unfinished at Brecht&#x27;s death in 1956; it was completed by Manfred Wekwerth and Joachim Tenschert and staged in Frankfurt in 1962.

In 1963, the BBC included Coriolanus in &quot;The Spread of the Eagle&quot;.

Slovak composer Ján Cikker adapted the play into an opera which premiered in 1974 in Prague.

In 1983, the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; series produced a version of the play. It starred Alan Howard and was directed by Elijah Moshinsky.

In 2003, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed a new staging of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (along with two other plays) starring Greg Hicks at the University of Michigan. The director, David Farr, saw the play as depicting the modernisation of an ancient ritualised culture, and drew on samurai influences to illustrate that view. He described it as &quot;in essence, a modern production. The play is basically about the birth of democracy.&quot;

In 2011, Ralph Fiennes directed and starred as Coriolanus with Gerard Butler as Aufidius and Vanessa Redgrave as Volumnia in a modern-day film adaptation &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray in May, 2012. It has a 93% rating on the film review site Rottentomatoes.com. Slavoj Žižek argued that unlike preceding adaptations, Fiennes&#x27; film portrayed Coriolanus without trying to rationalise his behaviour, as a raw figure for the &quot;radical left&quot; whom he compares to Che Guevara, whom Žižek characterises as making clear that &quot;a revolutionary also has to be a &#x27;killing machine&#x27;&quot;.

In 2019, the Tanghalang Pilipino staged a Filipino translation of the tragedy. It was translated by Guelan Varela-Luarca and was directed by Carlos Siguion-Reyna. The play was led by TP Actors Company&#x27;s senior member Marco Viaña as Coriolanus, opposite to him is Brian Sy as Tullus Aufidius, Frances Makil-Ignacio and Sherry Lara alternating the role of Volumnia. Along with them are Jonathan Tadioan as Menenius, JV Ibesate as Velutus, Doray Dayao as Brutus, and the Tanghalang Pilipino Actors Company.

===Parody===
While the title character&#x27;s name&#x27;s pronunciation in classical Latin has the &quot;a&quot; pronounced &quot;[aː]&quot; in the IPA, in English the a is usually pronounced &quot;[eɪ].&quot; Ken Ludwig&#x27;s &quot;Moon Over Buffalo&quot; contains a joke dependent upon this pronunciation, and the parody &quot;The Complete Wrks of Wllm Shkspr (Abridged)&quot; refers to it as &quot;the anus play&quot;. Shakespeare pronunciation guides list both pronunciations as acceptable.

Cole Porter&#x27;s song &quot;Brush Up Your Shakespeare&quot; from the musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; includes the lines: &quot;If she says your behaviour is heinous,/Kick her right in the Coriolanus&quot;.

Based on &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, and written in blank verse, &quot;Complots of Mischief&quot; is a satirical critique of those who dismiss conspiracy theories. Written by philosopher Charles Pigden, it was published in &quot;Conspiracy Theories: The Philosophical Debate&quot; (Ashgate 2006).

<text>The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) was an academic publishing service, founded by Eugene Garfield in Philadelphia in 1956. ISI offered scientometric and bibliographic database services. Its specialty was citation indexing and analysis, a field pioneered by Garfield.

==Services==
ISI maintained citation databases covering thousands of academic journals, including a continuation of its longtime print-based indexing service the Science Citation Index (SCI), as well as the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). All of these were available via ISI&#x27;s Web of Knowledge database service. This database allows a researcher to identify which articles have been cited most frequently, and who has cited them. The database provides some measure of the academic impact of the papers indexed in it, and may increase their impact by making them more visible and providing them with a quality label. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that appearing in this database can double the number of citations received by a given paper. The company&#x27;s main product was &quot;Current Contents&quot;, which gathers the tables of contents for recent academic journals.

The ISI also published the annual &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; which list an impact factor for each of the journals that it tracked. Within the scientific community, journal impact factors continue to play a large but controversial role in determining the kudos attached to a scientist&#x27;s published research record.

A list of over 14,000 journals was maintained by the ISI. The list included some 1,100 arts and humanities journals as well as scientific journals. Listings were based on published selection criteria and are an indicator of journal quality and impact.

ISI published &quot;Science Watch&quot;, a newsletter which every two months identified one paper published in the previous two years as a &quot;fast-breaking paper&quot; in each of 22 broad fields of science, such as Mathematics (including Statistics), Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. The designations were based on the number of citations and the largest increase from one bimonthly update to the next. Articles about the papers often included comments by the authors.

The ISI also published a list of &quot;ISI Highly Cited Researchers&quot;, one of the factors included in the Academic Ranking of World Universities published by Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This continues under Clarivate.

==History==
Initially, the company was named Documation. In 1992, ISI was acquired by Thomson Scientific &amp; Healthcare, and became known as Thomson ISI. It was a part of the Intellectual Property &amp; Science business of Thomson Reuters until 2016, when the IP &amp; Science business was sold, becoming Clarivate Analytics. Clarivate has since established ISI as part of its Scientific and Academic Research group.

== ISI Highly Cited ==

&quot;ISI Highly Cited&quot; is a database of &quot;highly cited researchers&quot;—scientific researchers whose publications are most often cited in academic journals over the past decade, published by the Institute for Scientific Information. Inclusion in this list is taken as a measure of the esteem of these academics and is used, for example, by the Academic Ranking of World Universities. It was founded under ISI and as of 2018 continues under the same name at Clarivate.

The methodology for inclusion is to consider papers in the upper first percentile based on citation counts of all articles indexed in the Scientific Citation Databases and published in a single, fixed year. Papers in the upper first percentile with respect to their year of publication are called highly cited papers. Each paper in the data is assigned to one or more of 21 categories, based on the ISI classification of the journal in which the article was published. The Highly Cited Researchers list is compiled by selecting, in every field, those researchers with the highest number of highly cited papers in a 10-year, rolling time period. The number of highly cited researchers varies from field to field and is determined accordingly to the total number of researchers contributing to the single field.

The categories are:
The publication list and biographical details supplied by the researchers are freely available online, although general access to the ISI citation database is by subscription.

<text>The impact factor (IF) or journal impact factor (JIF) of an academic journal is a scientometric index calculated by Clarivate that reflects the yearly mean number of citations of articles published in the last two years in a given journal, as indexed by Clarivate&#x27;s Web of Science.

As a journal-level metric, it is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field; journals with higher impact factor values are given the status of being more important, or carry more prestige in their respective fields, than those with lower values.

While frequently used by universities and funding bodies to decide on promotion and research proposals, it has been criticised for distorting good scientific practices.

==History==
The impact factor was devised by Eugene Garfield, the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in Philadelphia. Impact factors began to be calculated yearly starting from 1975 for journals listed in the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; (JCR). ISI was acquired by Thomson Scientific &amp; Healthcare in 1992, and became known as Thomson ISI. In 2018, Thomson-Reuters spun off and sold ISI to Onex Corporation and Baring Private Equity Asia. They founded a new corporation, Clarivate, which is now the publisher of the JCR.

==Calculation==
In any given year, the two-year journal impact factor is the ratio between the number of citations received in that year for publications in that journal that were published in the two preceding years and the total number of &quot;citable items&quot; published in that journal during the two preceding years:

formula_1

For example, &quot;Nature&quot; had an impact factor of 41.577 in 2017:

formula_2

This means that, on average, its papers published in 2015 and 2016 received roughly 42 citations each in 2017. 2017 impact factors are reported in 2018; they cannot be calculated until all of the 2017 publications have been processed by the indexing agency.

The value of impact factor depends on how to define &quot;citations&quot; and &quot;publications&quot;; the latter are often referred to as &quot;citable items&quot;. In current practice, both &quot;citations&quot; and &quot;publications&quot; are defined exclusively by ISI as follows. &quot;Publications&quot; are items that are classed as &quot;article&quot;, &quot;review&quot; or &quot;proceedings paper&quot; in the Web of Science (WoS) database; other items like editorials, corrections, notes, retractions and discussions are excluded. WoS is accessible to all registered users, who can independently verify the number of citable items for a given journal. In contrast, the number of citations is extracted not from the WoS database, but from a dedicated JCR database, which is not accessible to general readers. Hence, the commonly used &quot;JCR Impact Factor&quot; is a proprietary value, which is defined and calculated by ISI and can not be verified by external users.

New journals, which are indexed from their first published issue, will receive an impact factor after two years of indexing; in this case, the citations to the year prior to volume 1, and the number of articles published in the year prior to volume 1, are known zero values. Journals that are indexed starting with a volume other than the first volume will not get an impact factor until they have been indexed for three years. Occasionally, &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; assigns an impact factor to new journals with less than two years of indexing, based on partial citation data. The calculation always uses two complete and known years of item counts, but for new titles one of the known counts is zero. Annuals and other irregular publications sometimes publish no items in a particular year, affecting the count. The impact factor relates to a specific time period; it is possible to calculate it for any desired period. For example, the JCR also includes a five-year impact factor, which is calculated by dividing the number of citations to the journal in a given year by the number of articles published in that journal in the previous five years.

==Use==
While originally invented as a tool to help university librarians to decide which journals to purchase, the impact factor soon became used as a measure for judging academic success. This use of impact factors was summarised by Hoeffel in 1998:

Impact Factor is not a perfect tool to measure the quality of articles but there is nothing better and it has the advantage of already being in existence and is, therefore, a good technique for scientific evaluation. Experience has shown that in each specialty the best journals are those in which it is most difficult to have an article accepted, and these are the journals that have a high impact factor. Most of these journals existed long before the impact factor was devised. The use of impact factor as a measure of quality is widespread because it fits well with the opinion we have in each field of the best journals in our specialty...In conclusion, prestigious journals publish papers of high level. Therefore, their impact factor is high, and not the contrary.

As impact factors are a journal-level metric, rather than an article- or individual-level metric, this use is controversial. Eugene Garfield, the inventor of the JIF agreed with Hoeffel, but warned about the &quot;misuse in evaluating individuals&quot; because there is &quot;a wide variation [of citations] from article to article within a single journal&quot;. Despite this warning, the use of the JIF has evolved, playing a key role in the process of assessing individual researchers, their job applications and their funding proposals. In 2005, &quot;The Journal of Cell Biology&quot; noted that:

Impact factor data ... have a strong influence on the scientific community, affecting decisions on where to publish, whom to promote or hire, the success of grant applications, and even salary bonuses.

More targeted research has begun to provide firm evidence of how deeply the impact factor is embedded within formal and informal research assessment processes. A review in 2019 studied how often the JIF featured in documents related to the review, promotion, and tenure of scientists in US and Canadian universities. It concluded that 40% of universities focused on academic research specifically mentioned the JIF as part of such review, promotion, and tenure processes. And a 2017 study of how researchers in the life sciences behave concluded that &quot;everyday decision-making practices as highly governed by pressures to publish in high-impact journals&quot;. The deeply embedded nature of such indicators not only effect research assessment, but the more fundamental issue of what research is actually undertaken: &quot;Given the current ways of evaluation and valuing research, risky, lengthy, and unorthodox project rarely take center stage.&quot;

==Criticism==
Numerous critiques have been made regarding the use of impact factors, both in terms of its statistical validity and also of its implications for how science is carried out and assessed. A 2007 study noted that the most fundamental flaw is that impact factors present the mean of data that are not normally distributed, and suggested that it would be more appropriate to present the median of these data. There is also a more general debate on the validity of the impact factor as a measure of journal importance and the effect of policies that editors may adopt to boost their impact factor (perhaps to the detriment of readers and writers). Other criticism focuses on the effect of the impact factor on behavior of scholars, editors and other stakeholders. Criticism of impact factors also extends to its impact on researcher behavior. While the emphasis on high-impact journals may lead to strategic publishing practices that prioritize journal prestige over the quality and relevance of research, it&#x27;s important to acknowledge the &quot;privilege paradox&quot;. Younger researchers, particularly those from under-represented regions, often lack the established reputation or networks to secure recognition outside of these metrics. This can lead to a narrow focus on publishing in top-tier journals, potentially compromising the diversity of research topics and methodologies. Further criticisms argue that emphasis on impact factor results from the negative influence of neoliberal politics on academia. Some of these arguments demand not just replacement of the impact factor with more sophisticated metrics but also discussion on the social value of research assessment and the growing precariousness of scientific careers in higher education.

===Inapplicability of impact factor to individuals and between-discipline differences===
It has been stated that impact factors in particular and citation analysis in general are affected by field-dependent factors which invalidate comparisons not only across disciplines but even within different fields of research of one discipline. The percentage of total citations occurring in the first two years after publication also varies highly among disciplines from 1–3% in the mathematical and physical sciences to 5–8% in the biological sciences. Thus impact factors cannot be used to compare journals across disciplines.

Impact factors are sometimes used to evaluate not only the journals but the papers therein, thereby devaluing papers in certain subjects. In 2004, the Higher Education Funding Council for England was urged by the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee to remind Research Assessment Exercise panels that they are obliged to assess the quality of the content of individual articles, not the reputation of the journal in which they are published. Other studies have repeatedly stated that impact factor is a metric for journals and should not be used to assess individual researchers or institutions.

===Questionable editorial policies that affect the impact factor===
Because impact factor is commonly accepted as a proxy for research quality, some journals adopt editorial policies and practices, some acceptable and some of dubious purpose, to increase its impact factor. For example, journals may publish a larger percentage of review articles which generally are cited more than research reports. Research undertaken in 2020 on dentistry journals concluded that the publication of &quot;systematic reviews have significant effect on the Journal Impact Factor ... while papers publishing clinical trials bear no influence on this factor. Greater yearly average of published papers ... means a higher impact factor.&quot;

Journals may also attempt to limit the number of &quot;citable items&quot;—i.e., the denominator of the impact factor equation—either by declining to publish articles that are unlikely to be cited (such as case reports in medical journals) or by altering articles (e.g., by not allowing an abstract or bibliography in hopes that Journal Citation Reports will not deem it a &quot;citable item&quot;). As a result of negotiations over whether items are &quot;citable&quot;, impact factor variations of more than 300% have been observed. Items considered to be uncitable—and thus are not incorporated in impact factor calculations—can, if cited, still enter into the numerator part of the equation despite the ease with which such citations could be excluded. This effect is hard to evaluate, for the distinction between editorial comment and short original articles is not always obvious. For example, letters to the editor may be part of either class.

Another less insidious tactic journals employ is to publish a large portion of its papers, or at least the papers expected to be highly cited, early in the calendar year. This gives those papers more time to gather citations. Several methods, not necessarily with nefarious intent, exist for a journal to cite articles in the same journal which will increase the journal&#x27;s impact factor.

Beyond editorial policies that may skew the impact factor, journals can take overt steps to game the system. For example, in 2007, the specialist journal &quot;Folia Phoniatrica et Logopaedica&quot;, with an impact factor of 0.66, published an editorial that cited all its articles from 2005 to 2006 in a protest against the &quot;absurd scientific situation in some countries&quot; related to use of the impact factor. The large number of citations meant that the impact factor for that journal increased to 1.44. As a result of the increase, the journal was not included in the 2008 and 2009 &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;.

Coercive citation is a practice in which an editor forces an author to add extraneous citations to an article before the journal will agree to publish it, in order to inflate the journal&#x27;s impact factor. A survey published in 2012 indicates that coercive citation has been experienced by one in five researchers working in economics, sociology, psychology, and multiple business disciplines, and it is more common in business and in journals with a lower impact factor. Editors of leading business journals banded together to disavow the practice. However, cases of coercive citation have occasionally been reported for other disciplines.

===Assumed correlation between impact factor and quality===
The journal impact factor was originally designed by Eugene Garfield as a metric to help librarians make decisions about which journals were worth indexing, as the JIF aggregates the number of citations to articles published in each journal. Since then, the JIF has become associated as a mark of journal &quot;quality&quot;, and gained widespread use for evaluation of research and researchers instead, even at the institutional level. It thus has significant impact on steering research practices and behaviours.

By 2010, national and international research funding institutions were already starting to point out that numerical indicators such as the JIF should not be considered as a measure of quality. In fact, research was indicating that the JIF is a highly manipulated metric, and the justification for its continued widespread use beyond its original narrow purpose seems due to its simplicity (easily calculable and comparable number), rather than any actual relationship to research quality.

Empirical evidence shows that the misuse of the JIF—and journal ranking metrics in general—has a number of negative consequences for the scholarly communication system. These include gaps between the reach of a journal and the quality of its individual papers and insufficient coverage of social sciences and humanities as well as research outputs from across Latin America, Africa, and South-East Asia. Additional drawbacks include the marginalization of research in vernacular languages and on locally relevant topics and inducement to unethical authorship and citation practices. More generally, the impact factors fosters a reputation economy, where scientific success is based on publishing in prestigious journals ahead of actual research qualities such as rigorous methods, replicability and social impact. Using journal prestige and the JIF to cultivate a competition regime in academia has been shown to have deleterious effects on research quality.

A number of regional and international initiatives are now providing and suggesting alternative research assessment systems, including key documents such as the Leiden Manifesto and the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). Plan S calls for a broader adoption and implementation of such initiatives alongside fundamental changes in the scholarly communication system. As appropriate measures of quality for authors and research, concepts of research excellence should be remodelled around transparent workflows and accessible research results.

JIFs are still regularly used to evaluate research in many countries, which is a problem since a number of issues remain around the opacity of the metric and the fact that it is often negotiated by publishers.

===Negotiated values===
Results of an impact factor can change dramatically depending on which items are considered as &quot;citable&quot; and therefore included in the denominator. One notorious example of this occurred in 1988 when it was decided that meeting abstracts published in &quot;FASEB Journal&quot; would no longer be included in the denominator. The journal&#x27;s impact factor jumped from 0.24 in 1988 to 18.3 in 1989. Publishers routinely discuss with Clarivate how to improve the &quot;accuracy&quot; of their journals&#x27; impact factor and therefore get higher scores.

Such discussions routinely produce &quot;negotiated values&quot; which result in dramatic changes in the observed scores for dozens of journals, sometimes after unrelated events like the purchase by one of the larger publishers.

===Distribution skewness===
Because citation counts have highly skewed distributions, the mean number of citations is potentially misleading if used to gauge the typical impact of articles in the journal rather than the overall impact of the journal itself. For example, about 90% of &quot;Nature&quot;″s 2004 impact factor was based on only a quarter of its publications. Thus the actual number of citations for a single article in the journal is in most cases much lower than the mean number of citations across articles. Furthermore, the strength of the relationship between impact factors of journals and the citation rates of the papers therein has been steadily decreasing since articles began to be available digitally.

The effect of outliers can be seen in the case of the article &quot;A short history of SHELX&quot;, which included this sentence: &quot;This paper could serve as a general literature citation when one or more of the open-source SHELX programs (and the Bruker AXS version SHELXTL) are employed in the course of a crystal-structure determination&quot;. This article received more than 6,600 citations. As a consequence, the impact factor of the journal &quot;Acta Crystallographica Section A&quot; rose from 2.051 in 2008 to 49.926 in 2009, more than &quot;Nature&quot; (at 31.434) and &quot;Science&quot; (at 28.103). The second-most cited article in &quot;Acta Crystallographica Section A&quot; in 2008 had only 28 citations.

Critics of the JIF state that use of the arithmetic mean in its calculation is problematic because the pattern of citation distribution is skewed and citation distributions metrics have been proposed as an alternative to impact factors.

However, there have also been pleas to take a more nuanced approach to judging the distribution skewness of the impact factor. Ludo Waltman and Vincent Antonio Traag, in their 2021 paper, ran numerous simulations and concluded that &quot;statistical objections against the use of the IF at the level of individual articles are not convincing&quot;, and that &quot;the IF may be a more accurate indicator of the value of an article than the number of citations of the article&quot;.

===Reproducibility===
While the underlying mathematical model is publicly known, the dataset which is used to calculate the JIF is not publicly available. This prompted criticism: &quot;Just as scientists would not accept the findings in a scientific paper without seeing the primary data, so should they not rely on Thomson Scientific&#x27;s impact factor, which is based on hidden data&quot;. However, a 2019 article demonstrated that &quot;with access to the data and careful cleaning, the JIF can be reproduced&quot;, although this required much labour to achieve. A 2020 research paper went further. It indicated that by querying open access or partly open-access databases, like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and Scopus, it is possible to calculate approximate impact factors without the need to purchase Web of Science / JCR.

===Broader negative impact on science===
Just as the impact factor has attracted criticism for various immediate problems associated with its application, so has there also been criticism that its application undermines the broader process of science. Research has indicated that bibliometrics figures, particularly the impact factor, decrease the quality of peer review an article receives, cause a reluctance to share data, decrease the quality of articles, and a reduce the scope in of publishable research. &quot;For many researchers the only research questions and projects that appear viable are those that can meet the demand of scoring well in terms of metric performance indicators – and chiefly the journal impact factor.&quot;. Furthermore, the process of publication and science is slowed down – authors automatically try and publish with the journals with the highest impact factor – &quot;as editors and reviewers are tasked with reviewing papers that are not submitted to the most appropriate venues&quot;.

==Institutional responses to criticism of the impact factor==
Given the growing criticism and its widespread usage as a means of research assessment, organisations and institutions have begun to take steps to move away from the journal impact factor. In November 2007 the European Association of Science Editors (EASE) issued an official statement recommending &quot;that journal impact factors are used only—and cautiously—for measuring and comparing the influence of entire journals, but not for the assessment of single papers, and certainly not for the assessment of researchers or research programmes&quot;.

In July 2008, the International Council for Science Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the Conduct of Science issued a &quot;statement on publication practices and indices and the role of peer review in research assessment&quot;, suggesting many possible solutions—e.g., considering a limit number of publications per year to be taken into consideration for each scientist, or even penalising scientists for an excessive number of publications per year—e.g., more than 20.

In February 2010, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) published new guidelines to reduce the number of publications that could be submitted when applying for funding: &quot;The focus has not been on what research someone has done but rather how many papers have been published and where.&quot; They noted that for decisions concerning &quot;performance-based funding allocations, postdoctoral qualifications, appointments, or reviewing funding proposals, [where] increasing importance has been given to numerical indicators such as the h-index and the impact factor&quot;. The UK&#x27;s Research Assessment Exercise for 2014 also banned the journal impact factor although evidence suggested that this ban was often ignored.

In response to growing concerns over the inappropriate use of journal impact factors in evaluating scientific outputs and scientists themselves, the American Society for Cell Biology together with a group of editors and publishers of scholarly journals created the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). Released in May 2013, DORA has garnered support from thousands of individuals and hundreds of institutions, including in March 2015 the League of European Research Universities (a consortium of 21 of the most renowned research universities in Europe), who have endorsed the document on the DORA website.

Publishers, even those with high impact factors, also recognised the flaws. &quot;Nature&quot; magazine criticised the over-reliance on JIF, pointing not just to its statistical flaws but to negative effects on science: &quot;The resulting pressures and disappointments are nothing but demoralizing, and in badly run labs can encourage sloppy research that, for example, fails to test assumptions thoroughly or to take all the data into account before submitting big claims.&quot; Various publishers now use a mixture of metrics on their website; the PLOS series of journals does not display the impact factor. Microsoft Academic took a similar view, stating that h-index, EI/SCI and journal impact factors are not shown because &quot;the research literature has provided abundant evidence that these metrics are at best a rough approximation of research impact and scholarly influence.&quot;

In 2021, Utrecht University promised to abandon all quantitative bibliometrics, including the impact factor. The university stated that &quot;it has become a very sick model that goes beyond what is really relevant for science and putting science forward&quot;. This followed a 2018 decision by the main Dutch funding body for research, NWO, to remove all references to journal impact factors and the h-index in all call texts and application forms. Utrecht&#x27;s decision met with some resistance. An open letter signed by over 150 Dutch academics argued that, while imperfect, the JIF is still useful, and that omitting it &quot;will lead to randomness and a compromising of scientific quality&quot;.

==Related indices==
Some related metrics, also calculated and published by the same organization, include:

* &quot;Cited half-life&quot;: the median age of the articles that were cited in &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; each year. For example, if a journal&#x27;s half-life in 2005 is 5, that means the citations from 2001 to 2005 are half of all the citations from that journal in 2005, and the other half of the citations precede 2001.
* &quot;Aggregate impact factor&quot; for a subject category: it is calculated taking into account the number of citations to all journals in the subject category and the number of articles from all the journals in the subject category.
* &quot;Immediacy index&quot;: the number of citations the articles in a journal receive in a given year divided by the number of articles published.
* &quot; Journal citation indicator&quot; (&quot;JCI&quot;): a JIF that adjusts for scientific field; it is similar to Source Normalized Impact per Paper, calculated based on the Scopus database. JCI is available for all journals in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS CC) -- including the AHCI, ESCI, BCI, CPCI—while JIF is only available for the SCIE and SSCI; however, starting in June 2023, JIF will also be issued for all journals in the WoS CC.
* &quot;JIF quartile ranking&quot;: a rank based on the four quartiles within a given subject or topic category.
* &quot;JIF percentile ranking&quot;: a percentile rank computed for a particular subject category.
A given journal may attain a different quartile or percentile in different categories.

As with the impact factor, there are some nuances to this: for example, Clarivate excludes certain article types (such as news items, correspondence, and errata) from the denominator.

===Other measures of scientific impact===

Additional journal-level metrics are available from other organizations. For example, &quot;CiteScore&quot; is a metric for serial titles in Scopus launched in December 2016 by Elsevier. While these metrics apply only to journals, there are also author-level metrics, such as the h-index, that apply to individual researchers. In addition, article-level metrics measure impact at an article level instead of journal level.

Other more general alternative metrics, or &quot;altmetrics&quot;, that include article views, downloads, or mentions in social media, offer a different perspective on research impact, concentrating more on immediate social impact in and outside academia.

===Counterfeit impact factors===
Fake impact factors or bogus impact factors are produced by certain companies or individuals. According to an article published in the &quot;Electronic Physician&quot;, these include Global Impact Factor, Citefactor, and Universal Impact Factor. Jeffrey Beall maintained a list of such misleading metrics. Another deceitful practice is reporting &quot;alternative impact factors&quot;, calculated as the average number of citations per article using citation indices other than JCR such as Google Scholar (e.g., &quot;Google-based Journal Impact Factor&quot;) or Microsoft Academic.

False impact factors are often used by predatory publishers. Consulting Journal Citation Reports&#x27; master journal list can confirm if a publication is indexed by the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;. The use of fake impact metrics is considered a red flag.

<doc id="1036866" wikidata="Q3218426" url="?curid=1036866" title="Lastminute.com">
<text>lastminute.com is an online travel and leisure retailer. 

The company was founded by Martha Lane Fox and Brent Hoberman in 1998 and was a part of the UK internet boom of the late 1990s, part of the dot-com bubble and trading on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol &#x27;LMN&#x27;.

In May 2005, LastMinute.com was acquired from Sabre by the Bravofly Rumbo Group which rebranded as Lastminute.com Group.

==History==

===From foundation to flotation: April 1998 to March 2000===
lastminute.com was founded in London by Martha Lane Fox and Brent Hoberman in 1998 to offer late holiday deals online. The founders were colleagues at media strategy consultants Spectrum.

By January 2000, the site had more than 500,000 regular users and its offerings had expanded to include travel, gifts and entertainment, with a specialisation in selling distressed inventory.

Prior to its flotation, the company raised a further $31m. It opened offices in Paris, Munich and Stockholm. During the ten months ending December 1999, the company handled £37m of transactions, which generated £330,000 of income.

The shares floated on the London Stock Exchange on 14 March 2000. The shares were placed at 380p, valuing the company at £571m. The price rose on the first day of trading to 511p, giving a valuation of £768m, before falling back to 492.5p later in the day. The paper wealth of the founders of the business went up to around £300m.

Two hundred and fifty thousand private investors had applied for shares in the flotation. 33m shares – 25% of the company – were being offered for sale, the bulk to institutional investors. Private applicants received just 35 shares each.

===Public listed company: March 2000 to May 2005===

Two weeks after listing, the share price had dropped to 270p. In the first week of April, the shares dipped below 190p, half the issue price. On Monday, 17 April 2000, after the biggest ever one-day fall in the New York stock market the preceding Friday, £35bn were wiped off the value of the London Stock Exchange. By now, lastminute.com was trading at 30% of its flotation price.

Its share price was rising again when the firm announced its first quarter&#x27;s results on 6 May 2000. The company had handled £7.16m of transactions, up 68% compared with the previous period. During this period, the company had invested in a new version of the website as well as international expansions. These factors pushed pre-tax losses up from £6m to £11m. The market responded to the better-than-expected figures and the shares closed the day up 8p at 245p. Two weeks later, however, the shares closed at 141p, as concerns over dotcom stocks increased, after boo.com went into liquidation.

The introduction of a new website – allowing late deals to be targeted according to users&#x27; personal tastes – was delayed but finally unveiled on 27 November 2000.

Meanwhile, on 14 August, lastminute.com announced the acquisition of Degriftour, a French online travel agent, for £27.1m cash and 19.7m new shares, worth 162p each at the previous day&#x27;s close.

Allan Leighton, the former head of Asda and president of the European division of Wal-Mart, joined the company as non-executive chairman on 20 October. The role was unpaid but he was granted options over 1m shares at a strike price of 137.5p. The market reacted with a 9p drop in the share price to 128p. The firm&#x27;s shares sank below 100p for the first time on 8 November and closed at 80p on 10 November. Full year results to 30 September 2000, announced on 4 December, were slightly ahead of expectations. Losses increased from £4.5m to £35.7m, while transaction value increased from £2.64m to £34.2m, excluding transactions by Degriftour. The company generated more revenue from interest payments than from ongoing business activities. Shares rose 4.9% to 75p. In November 2001 the company reported a £54m loss.

In November 2003, Lane-Fox announced that she would step down as managing director at the end of the year – in which the company made its first pre-tax profit of £200,000, short of analyst expectations of £4m. The company was acquired in 2005 by Sabre Holdings, owner of online travel company Travelocity, paying 165p per share, a 57 per cent premium to the share price prior to the takeover talks, but less than half the flotation price. The deal valued the company at £577 million.

Up until 2005, the company had not made a net profit since it floated five years earlier. In February 2005, it reported pre-tax losses of £26.5m. Hoberman stayed with the business until spring 2006 when he handed over the reins as CEO to Ian McCaig.

===Post-acquisition===
Following acquisition, a number of Sabre/Travelocity executives joined lastminute.com between 2005 and 2007, including Ed Kamm (former CFO of Travelocity, who was to succeed McCaig as CEO at the end of 2010), Damon Tassone, Josh Feuerstein (who are now co-founders at Intent Media) and Arun Rajan (now CTO at Zappos).

The team was further increased by the arrival of Brian Murphy to head up Holiday Autos and MedHotels (he had previously been at Hertz, Thomas Cook and American Express) Simon Thompson as CMO (who had previously been at Honda and Motorola and subsequently went to Apple), Joe Kenny from Cisco and Arnaldo Munoz from easyJet.

In April 2007, Coolgorilla released a downloadable version of the Talking Phrasebooks for Nokia and Sony Ericsson mobile devices with lastminute.com branding.

During 2008–2010, hires included Alistair Rodger (formerly Commercial Director at Hilton) and James Donaldson (who joined from News International to replace Kamm as CFO) and Mark Newton from AMEX.

It was the above teams of executives that led the business through a five-year period after the acquisition which was characterised by increased profitability and in January 2009, lastminute.com released nru (&quot;near you&quot;) a GPS-based restaurant search application for Android in the UK. A US version was released in May 2009, together with restaurant review guide, Zagat.

In 2009, lastminute.com was among the first online players to offer limited inventory &#x27;flash&#x27; sales which it branded &#x27;WIGIGs&#x27; (When It&#x27;s Gone It&#x27;s Gone). During this period the company also divested itself of its travel agent &#x27;bed booking bank&#x27; for hotels, MedHotels, which it sold to Thomas Cook for an undisclosed sum. The successful leisure car rental business, Holiday Autos, remained in the portfolio.

Structurally, the business also began to look quite different through the 2006–2010 period. Its technology hosting was moved to the US, offshore technology development became prevalent through use of Sabre&#x27;s facilities in South America, North America and India and lastminute.com itself opened a new centre in Poland to handle much of its back-office and customer fulfilment functions.

===2011–2015===
In early 2011, lastminute.com launched a pan-European marketing campaign called &#x27;Stories Start Here&#x27;, to position the brand as an online leisure, entertainment and travel retailer.

More recently, the company&#x27;s communications strategy focussed on a return to its &#x27;last minute&#x27; roots, promoting the customer savings that can be achieved when booking at the last minute. A revisited focus on &#x27;the weekend&#x27; has also been an important development for the company, which created a dedicated section of their website in August 2011, providing weekend-specific offers.

In August 2014, lastminute.com ranked in 6th place in a Travel Brand Index conducted by an independent market research firm.

In December 2014, the firm was bought by Bravofly Rumbo for £76 million, a fraction of the £600 million Sabre had paid for it in 2005.

===2015–2018===
In 2015, Bravofly Rumbo Group (SIX: BRG), changed its corporate name to lastminute.com over the course of the year. The change of the corporate name reflected the new brand strategy of the group, following the acquisition of lastminute.com. While the existing digital brands Bravofly, Volagratis, Rumbo and Jetcost continued to target online growth, lastminute.com will now become the core brand supported by increased marketing investments. An advertising campaign, with more than double the investment versus 2014, was launched early June and ran across three key markets – UK, France and Italy – representing 65% of revenues of the group at that time.

In September 2016, the lastminute.com group, acquired WAYN, Where Are You Now?’ to implement a content factory within the Group and differentiate lastminute.com positioning against other online travel players. WAYN, the world&#x27;s largest social travel network, has been integrated with lastminute.com group&#x27;s new media business and aims to boost the ability to engage a young and captive audience with the addition of WAYN’S 20 million registered members and 2 million monthly unique visitors.

In November 2017, lastminute.com group announced the acquisition of hotelscan to diversify its metasearch value proposition. Founded in 2012, hotelscan has created a search engine for Hotels, Bed &amp; Breakfasts, Hostels, Apartments and other types of accommodations, Its daily updated database has around 1.3 million properties, with data from over 100 online booking websites, provides travelers with relevant content to find room availability.

In December 2017, lastminute.com group decided to scale up its positioning in Germany and bought Comvel GmbH, founded 2004 in Munich, which operates the travel website weg.de, one of Germany&#x27;s best-known online travel sites which had been a wholly owned subsidiary of ProSiebenSat.1 Group since January 2014. weg.de offers its customers the entire range of travel options, with its primary focus on package holidays and all-inclusive vacations.

==Criticism==
In 2009, lastminute.com attracted much criticism on consumer sites and blogs regarding their association with highstreetmax.com, a brand owned by Adaptive Affinity, in turn owned by US corporation Vertrue. The company was accused of subjecting customers to negative option selling, whereby if they click or do not untick a certain box they find later that they were subject to unauthorised credit card withdrawals for membership schemes they had not signed up for, whose details they were not advised and whose supposed benefits they did not see. This attracted the attention of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s consumer affairs programme &quot;You and Yours&quot; on 30 January 2008 and the consumer pages of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in July 2008.

The firm responded by discontinuing the relationship with highstreetmax.com and saying, &#x27;Once our customers leave our site they are given an option to sign-up for a third-party cash back programme. When they sign up within the terms and conditions it is made clear that further payments will be taken. However we have had some feedback from customers who have inadvertently signed up. On this basis we feel that it is the right thing to do to take this off our site.&#x27;

On 18 May 2020, Lastminute.com was listed 49th worst of 53 Travel Companies in giving refunds for cancelled flights and refunds by Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis. They were given a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -87 calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who rated their experience with the firm as &#x27;Poor&#x27; from the percentage who rated their experience as &#x27;Great&#x27;. The number who rated their experience as &#x27;OK&#x27; is not factored in. Only 4 others out of 53 were given poorer scores.

In 2020, Lastminute.com and competitor GoToGate attracted criticism from consumer group &quot;Which?&quot; after the company failed to meet its promise to refund customers for Covid-impacted holidays. The online travel agent was investigated by the Competitions and Market Authority (CMA) in December 2020, as a result of this failure. A survey conducted by &quot;Which?&quot; in the same month ranked Lastminute.com as &quot;the worst booking site in the UK&quot;, with the year &quot;being an even worse bet, because of the way it has treated customers during the coronavirus pandemic&quot;.

<doc id="1036883" wikidata="Q1427600" url="?curid=1036883" title="Somite">
<text>The somites (outdated term: primitive segments) are a set of bilaterally paired blocks of paraxial mesoderm that form in the embryonic stage of somitogenesis, along the head-to-tail axis in segmented animals. In vertebrates, somites subdivide into the 
dermatomes, myotomes, 
sclerotomes and syndetomes that give rise to the vertebrae of the vertebral column, rib cage, part of the occipital bone, skeletal muscle, cartilage, tendons, and skin (of the back).

The word &quot;somite&quot; is sometimes also used in place of the word &quot;metamere&quot;. In this definition, the somite is a homologously-paired structure in an animal body plan, such as is visible in annelids and arthropods.

==Development==

The mesoderm forms at the same time as the other two germ layers, the ectoderm and endoderm. The mesoderm at either side of the neural tube is called paraxial mesoderm. It is distinct from the mesoderm underneath the neural tube, which is called the chordamesoderm that becomes the notochord. The paraxial mesoderm is initially called the &quot;segmental plate&quot; in the chick embryo or the &quot;unsegmented mesoderm&quot; in other vertebrates. As the primitive streak regresses and neural folds gather (to eventually become the neural tube), the paraxial mesoderm separates into blocks called somites.

===Formation===

The pre-somitic mesoderm commits to the somitic fate before mesoderm becomes capable of forming somites. The cells within each somite are specified based on their location within the somite. Additionally, they retain the ability to become any kind of somite-derived structure until relatively late in the process of somitogenesis.

The development of the somites depends on a clock mechanism as described by the clock and wavefront model. In one description of the model, oscillating Notch and Wnt signals provide the clock. The wave is a gradient of the fibroblast growth factor protein that is rostral to caudal (nose to tail gradient). Somites form one after the other down the length of the embryo from the head to the tail, with each new somite forming on the caudal (tail) side of the previous one.

The timing of the interval is not universal. Different species have different interval timing. In the chick embryo, somites are formed every 90 minutes. In the mouse the interval is 2 hours.

For some species, the number of somites may be used to determine the stage of embryonic development more reliably than the number of hours post-fertilization because rate of development can be affected by temperature or other environmental factors. The somites appear on both sides of the neural tube simultaneously. Experimental manipulation of the developing somites will not alter the rostral/caudal orientation of the somites, as the cell fates have been determined prior to somitogenesis. Somite formation can be induced by Noggin-secreting cells. The number of somites is species dependent and independent of embryo size (for example, if modified via surgery or genetic engineering). Chicken embryos have 50 somites; mice have 65, while snakes have 500.

As cells within the paraxial mesoderm begin to come together, they are termed somitomeres, indicating a lack of complete separation between segments. The outer cells undergo a mesenchymal–epithelial transition to form an epithelium around each somite. The inner cells remain as mesenchyme.
====Notch signalling ====

The Notch system, as part of the clock and wavefront model, forms the boundaries of the somites. DLL1 and DLL3 are Notch ligands, mutations of which cause various defects. Notch regulates HES1, which sets up the caudal half of the somite. Notch activation turns on LFNG which in turn inhibits the Notch receptor. Notch activation also turns on the HES1 gene which inactivates LFNG, re-enabling the Notch receptor, and thus accounting for the oscillating clock model. MESP2 induces the EPHA4 gene, which causes repulsive interaction that separates somites by causing segmentation. EPHA4 is restricted to the boundaries of somites. EPHB2 is also important for boundaries.

====Mesenchymal-epithelial transition====

Fibronectin and N-cadherin are key to the mesenchymal–epithelial transition process in the developing embryo. The process is probably regulated by paraxis and MESP2. In turn, MESP2 is regulated by Notch signaling. Paraxis is regulated by processes involving the cytoskeleton.

====Specification====
The Hox genes specify somites as a whole based on their position along the anterior-posterior axis through specifying the pre-somitic mesoderm before somitogenesis occurs. After somites are made, their identity as a whole has already been determined, as is shown by the fact that transplantation of somites from one region to a completely different region results in the formation of structures usually observed in the original region. In contrast, the cells within each somite retain plasticity (the ability to form any kind of structure) until relatively late in somitic development.

=== Derivatives ===
In the developing vertebrate embryo, somites split to form dermatomes, skeletal muscle (myotomes), tendons and cartilage (syndetomes) and bone (sclerotomes).
Because the sclerotome differentiates before the dermatome and the myotome, the term dermomyotome refers to the combined dermatome and myotome before they separate out.

====Dermatome====
The dermatome is the dorsal portion of the paraxial mesoderm somite which gives rise to the skin (dermis). In the human embryo, it arises in the third week of embryogenesis. It is formed when a dermomyotome (the remaining part of the somite left when the sclerotome migrates), splits to form the dermatome and the myotome. The dermatomes contribute to the skin, fat and connective tissue of the neck and of the trunk, though most of the skin is derived from lateral plate mesoderm.

====Myotome====
The myotome is that part of a somite that forms the muscles of the animal. Each myotome divides into an epaxial part (&quot;epimere&quot;), at the back, and a hypaxial part (&quot;hypomere&quot;) at the front. The myoblasts from the hypaxial division form the muscles of the thoracic and anterior abdominal walls. The epaxial muscle mass loses its segmental character to form the extensor muscles of the neck and trunk of mammals.

In fishes, salamanders, caecilians, and reptiles, the body musculature remains segmented as in the embryo, though it often becomes folded and overlapping, with epaxial and hypaxial masses divided into several distinct muscle groups.

====Sclerotome====

The sclerotome (or cutis plate) forms the vertebrae and the rib cartilage and part of the occipital bone; the myotome forms the musculature of the back, the ribs and the limbs; the syndetome forms the tendons and the dermatome forms the skin on the back. In addition, the somites specify the migration paths of neural crest cells and the axons of spinal nerves. From their initial location within the somite, the sclerotome cells migrate medially towards the notochord. These cells meet the sclerotome cells from the other side to form the vertebral body. The lower half of one sclerotome fuses with the upper half of the adjacent one to form each vertebral body. From this vertebral body, sclerotome cells move dorsally and surround the developing spinal cord, forming the vertebral arch. Other cells move distally to the costal processes of thoracic vertebrae to form the ribs.

== In arthropods==

In crustacean development, a somite is a segment of the hypothetical primitive crustacean body plan. In current crustaceans, several of those somites may be fused.

<text>Pelješac (; Chakavian: ; ) is a peninsula in southern Dalmatia in Croatia. The peninsula is part of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County and is the second largest peninsula in Croatia. From the isthmus that begins at Ston, to the top of Cape Lovišta, it is long.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Pelješac&quot; is most likely derived from the name of a hill above town of Orebić, which is Pelisac. This is a relatively new name for the peninsula. Other names have been used throughout history, such as the South Slavic &quot;Stonski Rat&quot;, the Latin &quot;Puncta Stagni&quot; and the Italian &quot;Ponta di Stagno&quot;.

==Geography==

The Bay of Mali Ston separates the peninsula from the Klek peninsula of Bosnia and Herzegovina and from the Croatian mainland. The Strait of Pelješac is located at its far western end, and it divides the peninsula from the island of Korčula. In the western part of the peninsula is the highest summit of Pelješac, Zmijino Brdo (lit. Snake&#x27;s Hill) with the peak Sveti Ilija at .

==Municipalities==

Administratively the peninsula is divided into the municipalities of:
* Orebić in the western part, with 3,705 inhabitants (2021)
* Trpanj in the northwest, a population of 683
* Janjina in the center, with 522 people
* Ston in the east, with 2,491 residents

==History==
===Prehistory===

The best known archeological site on the peninsula is Nakovana, which has preserved artifacts indicating continuous human settlement over several millennia.

The earliest known historic records of Pelješac are from ancient Greece. The area became part of the Roman province of Dalmatia after the Illyrian Wars (220 BC to 219 BC.). Roman migration soon followed.

=== Medieval history ===
In the 6th century Pelješac came under Byzantine rule.
Upon the arrival of the Slavs, the area from the Neretva river to Rijeka Dubrovačka, and from the northern Herzegovina mountains to the Adriatic coast, new socio-political entities had been established, namely &quot;Neretva&quot;, &quot;Primorje, Travunija&quot; and &quot;Zahumlje&quot;, and ruled by newly risen local nobility. Ston with &quot;Rat&quot; (then the name for the Pelješac peninsula) and Mljet were under the rule of one of these principalities, namely under the &quot;knez&quot; of Zahumlje. These local rulers acknowledged the supremacy of Byzantium. After Mihajlo Višević, who acknowledged the authority of Bulgarian emperor Simeon, Zahumlje was ruled over by different dynasties. Around 950, it was briefly ruled by Duke Časlav. At the end of the 10th century, Samuilo was the Lord of Zahumlje, and the dukedom belonged to king Ivan Vladimir. In 1168, the Dukedom and Zahumlje were conquered by Grand Prince of Raška Stefan Nemanja. Thirty years later, Zahumlje was invaded by Andrija, the Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia. In 1254, Béla IV of Hungary invaded Bosnia and Zahumlje. From 1304, Zahumlje was ruled by Mladen Šubić, then again for a short period by local župan, and from 1325 by Stjepan II Kotromanić. Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik), acquired it from Bosnian rulers in several purchases over several decades, first in 1333 and then on 15 January 1399. King Tvrtko II confirmed purchase of the &quot;Bosansko Primorje&quot; to Dubrovnik on 24 June 1405.

The old Ston was located on the slopes of the hills of Gorica and St. Michael, south of the Ston field. There were several early Christian churches there, the largest of which was St. Stephen&#x27;s Church. The bishopric church of Mary Magdalene stood until it was bombed by the Allies in 1944. The only church that still remains is the church of St. Michael, built in the middle of the late antique castrum.

The original old town was demolished in the earthquake of 1252. With the arrival of the Republic, a new city was built on today&#x27;s location. When renovations were made at the church of St. Michael at the top of the hill, fragments of Roman decorative plaster, Roman tombstones and antique ceramics were found, confirming this assumption. According to some sources, Ston experienced a destructive civil war in 1250, and in these conflicts the city suffered a great deal of destruction.

The turbulent times at the beginning of the 14th century spread across the entire country of Zahumlje. The usurpation by the Branivojević brothers, forced the people of Dubrovnik to fight them in 1326 with the help of Stjepan II Kotromanić. That year, people from Dubrovnik settled Ston, and immediately began to invest and rebuild, and established a new Ston to defend the Pelješac and protect the slaves from which they had earned big revenue. Since the conflict between the Ban in Bosnia and Serbian king, the Dubrovniks purchased Pelješac with Ston from both rulers in 1333.

Eastern Orthodoxy had appeared in Pelješac in the late 12th century, when the Catholic bishop was expelled from Ston and an Orthodox episcopate was established on the peninsula. However, despite the dominance of Orthodoxy, Catholicism had been preserved in the region,
and when the Pelješac peninsula came under the rule of Dubrovnik in 1333, it was still mostly inhabited by Catholics, with the presence of Orthodox and Bogomils. One of the first tasks of the new administration was therefore to spread Catholicism, create parishes and build churches and monasteries, in accordance with the principles of &quot;Cuius regio&quot;. In 1335, the Dubrovnik government expelled the Orthodox clergy and monks, bringing in Franciscans. And although some Orthodox priests remained in Pelješac afterwards, they were no longer present in the region from the 1380s onwards.

===Modern history===
The Walls of Ston are large fortifications built by the Republic of Ragusa. They are the second longest walls in Europe. Ston also has one of the oldest salt planes in this part of the world.

The French Empire occupied the region in 1806, abolishing the old Republic, and in 1808 turned it into the Illyrian Provinces. In 1815 it was given to the Austrian Empire and since 1867 became part of the Cisleithania of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Between 1918 and 1941 it was a part Kingdom of Yugoslavia and from 1945 it was part of Socialistic Republic of Croatia within Socialistic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. From 1991 it is part of Republic of Croatia.

==Transport==

The D414 road is the longest state road on the peninsula, connecting all municipalities, together with D415 towards Trpanj and D416 towards Prapratno. County roads in turn connect Lovište, Žuljana and Hodilje, and a number of local roads to the more remote villages. The Pelješac Bridge located near Brijesta connects the peninsula to the mainland near Komarna, and through it connects the southern semi-exclave of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County with the rest of the country via its territorial waters. It bypasses the narrow strip of coastline at Neum that grants Bosnia and Herzegovina sea access. There are car ferry routes connecting Trpanj to Ploče on the mainland, Orebić to Korčula on the eponymous island, and Prapratno to Sobra on Mljet.

<text>A battle rifle is a service rifle chambered to fire a fully powered cartridge.

The term &quot;battle rifle&quot; is a retronym created largely out of a need to differentiate automatic rifles chambered for fully powered cartridges from automatic rifles chambered for intermediate cartridges, which were later categorized as assault rifles. Battle rifles were most prominent from the 1940s to the 1970s, when they were used as service rifles. While modern battle rifles largely resemble modern assault rifle designs, which replaced battle rifles in most roles, the term may also describe older military full-power semi-automatic rifles such as the M1 Garand, SVT-40, Gewehr 41, Gewehr 43, Type 4, FN Model 1949, and MAS-49.

== History ==
=== World War I ===
====Semi-automatic====
First examples of semi-automatic fully powered-cartridge rifles used in World War I are the Fusil Automatique Modèle 1917 in 8×50mmR Lebel and the Winchester Model 1910 in .401 Winchester Self-Loading.
====Select fire====

During World War I, all of the world&#x27;s armies were equipped with bolt-action rifles, and the thought of fully automatic fire in a design that was lightweight and controllable enough to be used by a single soldier was seen as something that would be extremely useful in the static conditions of trench warfare.
The Russian Empire produced the world&#x27;s first battle rifle, the Fedorov Avtomat, which was select-fire and fired the rather underpowered 6.5mm Arisaka round from a 25-round box magazine. Only about 100 were produced and used during the war, before the Russian Civil War forced Russia to withdraw its forces in 1917, and so there is an absence of reports on the combat effectiveness of Fedorov rifles, but they continued to be produced until 1925. Fedorov rifles were also used in limited numbers during the opening stages of the Winter War. 

France developed the Chauchat-Ribeyrolles 1918 submachine gun, an automatic shortrifle chambered in 8×50mmR Lebel, intended to defend tank crews.

=== World War II ===
The battle rifle was of major significance during World War II, with the United States, Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and Imperial Japan all producing them in some capacity. Millions were produced during this era, but overall, with the sole exception of the United States, bolt-action rifles were much more common on the battlefield.

==== M1 Garand ====

At the outbreak of World War Two, the United States was the only nation in the world to have formally adopted a battle rifle as their service rifle. The M1 Garand fired the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, which loaded from an eight-round en bloc clip. When empty, this clip would eject upwards out of the rifle, making a distinctive &quot;ping&quot; sound in the process, after which a new en bloc clip could be inserted into the rifle. The adoption of the semi-automatic rifle allowed American riflemen to field much greater sustained firepower than their Allied and Axis contemporaries, who were still using bolt-action rifles as their primary rifle. The Garand continued to see front line service during the Korean War, saw limited service during the Vietnam War, and served as the basis for the creation of the M14 rifle.

==== SVT-40 ====

The Soviet Union issued one major battle rifle, the SVT-40, which was invented by Fedor Tokarev, who is also well known for creating the Tokarev pistol. It uses the 7.62×54mmR cartridge, and reloaded with a 10-round magazine, but the receiver was open-top, meaning it could also be loaded with 5-round stripper clips, the same ones used in the Mosin-Nagant. The SVT&#x27;s performance was overall unsatisfactory, owing largely to its lack of reliability, in particular that it needed frequent cleaning, and the stock was of a poor quality. Nonetheless, over 1 million rifles were produced, and it continued to see service until the end of the war. Like the Mosin-Nagant, it was replaced by the AK-47 shortly after World War II. A select fire variant named the AVT-40 was also produced in limited numbers where regular machine guns such as the DP-27 were not available, but the weapon&#x27;s 10 round capacity made it somewhat unsuitable for fully automatic fire.

==== FG-42 ====

Nazi Germany was responsible for a large amount of experimental weaponry during the war. Among these was the FG-42, a rifle built specifically for the Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers). The rifle was meant to be a jack-of-all-trades that would be used during the first stages of an airborne operation, before heavier weapons like the MG-42 could be sent in. The FG-42 was a select fire rifle, which had a 20-round magazine that loaded on the left of the rifle, and it used the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge. It was first used during the Battle of Rhodes (1943), and continued to see limited service until the end of the war, with a total of about 7,000 produced. Postwar observers were very impressed by the rifle, resulting in the British EM-2 rifle and the American M60 Machine Gun, which was standard issue in the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Both of these designs were heavily influenced by the FG-42.

==== Gewehr 41 and 43 ====

Another German design built during the Second World War was the Gewehr 41, which was produced by Walther Arms and Mauser, and had a 10-round internal magazine, loaded with 2 stripper clips and used the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge. About 145,000 were produced before the Mauser design was worked upon and made into the Gewehr 43. Externally, the two rifles look mostly identical, and the main difference that sets them apart is that the G43 reloads with external box magazines (10 rounds), and has a short-stroke piston, whereas the G41 uses the same system as that in the M1922 Bang rifle. Over 400,000 G43s were built.

==== Type 4 ====

During the Pacific War, the Empire of Japan created the Type 4 rifle, also known as the Type 5, to act as a counter to the American M1 Garand. While initial attempts were made as rudimentary copies of the Garand, it was found that the Japanese 7.7×58mm Arisaka cartridge didn&#x27;t respond well to being fitted into the Garand&#x27;s internals, and so, the en-bloc clip design of the Garand was replaced with a 10-round internal magazine, loaded with stripper clips, as was seen in the German Gewehr 41. Only 250 were built, in 1945, when the Imperial Japanese Army was already at its breaking point, and production ceased with the surrender in August of that year.

===Cold War===
====FN FAL====

The most enduring battle rifle of the Cold War is the FN FAL (&quot;Fusil Automatique Léger&quot;). The FAL is a rifle produced by Belgian company FN Herstal, firing 7.62×51mm NATO from 20 or 30 round box magazines. It was first produced in 1953, at which point all the nations of the Warsaw Pact except Czechoslovakia (which first used its own vz. 52 rifle before switching to the vz. 58 model), were all equipping with the AK-47, or some variant of it, but most NATO countries had their own, domestically produced designs. For instance, the United Kingdom used the Lee-Enfield, the United States used the M1 Garand, and France used the MAS-49. The FAL was supposed to solve this issue; however, the United States chose not to adopt it, primarily because their own design, the M14 rifle, was a pound lighter, less internally complex, and there was financial benefit for the United States in producing it domestically. At the time of its creation, it was adopted by several NATO countries, including Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, among many others. The United Kingdom manufactured their own version of the FAL, the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle, which is semi-automatic only. Though assault rifles are typically more common in contemporary usage, the FAL is still in active service in many nations (none of which are in NATO), most notably Brazil. In total, the FAL has been used by over 90 countries and over 7,000,000 have been produced, leading to the rifle&#x27;s other, unofficial name: &quot;The Right Arm of the Free World.&quot;

====Heckler &amp; Koch G3====
The &#x27;Heckler &amp; Koch G3 (&quot;Gewehr 3&quot;) is a roller-delayed blowback operating system rifle developed in the 1950s by the German armament manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch (H&amp;K) in collaboration with the Spanish state-owned design and development agency CETME (&quot;Centro de Estudios Técnicos de Materiales Especiales&quot;), firing 7.62×51mm NATO from 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 round detachable box magazines and 50 or 100 round detachable drum magazines. It was first produced in 1959. The modular designed G3 has over the years been exported to over 70 countries and manufactured under licence in at least 15 countries, bringing the total number built to around 7,800,000.

====M14====

The M14 rifle is an American design, made to replace the M1 Garand, which was used as the basis for the M14. It is a select fire weapon, firing 7.62×51mm NATO from 20-round detachable box magazines. It was the primary infantry rifle used during the Vietnam War, but once deployed into combat, there were complaints about the weapon&#x27;s performance, such as it was too difficult to control in full auto, its profile was too long, and the weapon was generally unreliable. A 1962 Department of Defense report described it as &quot;completely inferior&quot; to the M1 Garand. It went into production in 1959 and about 1,300,000 M14 rifles have been produced. The M14 was eventually replaced by the M16 assault rifle, which was a controversial decision as the M16&#x27;s less powerful 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, combined with the fact it was much smaller and lighter, and had plastic furniture instead of wood, led some soldiers to sarcastically call the new rifle the &#x27;Mattel 16&#x27;. Despite initial shortcomings, however, the M16 remains in American military service to this day, and it is the most produced rifle in 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge.

====AR-10====
The ArmaLite AR-10 is a 7.62×51mm NATO battle rifle designed by Eugene Stoner in 1955, as a late entrant to the United States Army&#x27;s Light Rifle Trials to replace the M1 Garand in US service. It was initially manufactured by ArmaLite (then a division of the Fairchild Aircraft Corporation) and under a manufacturing license by Artillerie Inrichtingen. First introduced in 1956, the AR-10 used an innovative combination of a straight-line barrel/stock design with phenolic composite, a new filed gas-operated bolt and carrier system and forged alloy parts resulting in a small arm significantly easier to control in automatic fire and over lighter than other infantry rifles of the day. Over its production life, the original AR-10 was built in relatively small numbers, with fewer than 10,000 rifles assembled. However, the ArmaLite AR-10 (later developed into the ArmaLite AR-15, M16 rifle, and M4 carbine) would become the progenitor for a wide range of firearms.

===Contemporary usage===

After WW2, the USSR was the first global power to make an assault rifle the standard infantry weapon, with the AK-47 family of firearms. After the United States formally adopted the M16 rifle in the 1960s, nearly every other nation adopted the assault rifle paradigm over the following decades. Because they were more controllable, much lighter, and still offered acceptable levels of penetration, intermediate cartridges were considered a better choice, and gradually battle rifles began to be replaced with weapons such as the Steyr AUG, Heckler &amp; Koch G36, FAMAS, and SA80. However, battle rifles do continue to be used in certain roles where the extra power is appreciated, for example, designated marksmen in the Bundeswehr use the HK417. Other examples of contemporary battle rifles include the SCAR-H, Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle, Desert Tech MDRx, IWI Tavor 7, and XM7 rifle.

<doc id="1036930" wikidata="Q58265" url="?curid=1036930" title="Béarnaise sauce">
<text>Béarnaise sauce (; ) is a sauce made of clarified butter, egg yolk, white wine vinegar, and herbs. It is regarded as a &quot;child&quot; of hollandaise sauce. The difference is in the flavoring: béarnaise uses shallot, black pepper, and tarragon, while hollandaise uses white pepper or a pinch of cayenne.

The sauce&#x27;s name derives from the province of Béarn, France. It is a traditional sauce for steak.

==History==
According to a common explanation, the sauce was accidentally invented by the chef Jean-Louis-François Collinet, the accidental inventor of puffed potatoes (&quot;pommes de terre soufflées&quot;), and served at the 1836 opening of Le Pavillon Henri IV, a restaurant at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The restaurant was in the former residence of Henry IV of France, a gourmet himself, who was from Béarn.

Although the sauce is a French invention, it caught on in the Nordic countries in the late 20th century, where it forms a major part of local steak cuisine with steaks and fries, and is occasionally used there as topping on pizza, whether as part of the pizza or as a cold dressing put on afterwards.

==Preparation==
As with hollandaise, there are several methods for preparing béarnaise. 

The most common method of preparation uses a &quot;bain-marie&quot;, whisking to a temperature of , where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks. 

Auguste Escoffier and other sources call for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon, and crushed peppercorns (later strained out).

Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a finished hollandaise (without lemon juice). &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; describes a blender preparation with the same ingredients.

==Derivatives== 
* Sauce Choron (also called béarnaise tomatée) uses tomato purée instead of herbs. It is named after Alexandre Étienne Choron.
* Sauce Foyot (also called Valois) is béarnaise with meat glaze (glace de viande) added.
* Sauce Paloise uses mint instead of tarragon.

<text>F1000 (formerly &quot;Faculty of 1000&quot;) is an open research publisher for scientists, scholars, and clinical researchers. F1000 offers a different research evaluation service from standard academic journals by offering peer-review after, rather than before, publishing a research article. Initially, F1000 was named after the 1,000 faculty members that performed peer-reviews, but over time F1000 expanded to more than 8,000 members. When F1000 was acquired by Taylor &amp; Francis Group in January 2020, it kept the publishing services. F1000Prime (AKA Faculty Opinions) and F1000 Workspace (AKA Sciwheel) were acquired by different brands.

==History==
&quot;Faculty of 1000&quot; was founded in 2000 by publishing entrepreneur Vitek Tracz in London. Initially, it was named after the 1,000 experts it had reviewing academic works, but over time F1000 expanded to more than 8,000 members. In 2002, it introduced F1000Prime (later known as Faculty Opinions), which recommended scientific articles selected by its experts. At first, F1000 was focused on biology, but later expanded to additional scientific fields over time, including a focus on medicine beginning in 2006.
The company was part of the Science Navigation Group until its acquisition by Taylor &amp; Francis in January 2020. As part of the deal, founder Vitek Tracz remained the owner of Prime and Workspace, leaving the new F1000 (and F1000Research) owned by Taylor &amp; Francis. Faculty Opinions (F1000Prime) was later acquired by a tech company called H1 in February 2022. F1000 now only provides publishing and related services.

== Services==

F1000 is an open research publisher for academic works. Its model focuses on publishing findings quickly using a post-publication peer-review system. Authors submit an article and all of its underlying data. F1000 does a prepublication check and publishes the article, usually within a couple weeks. After the article is published, an expert is assigned to conduct a peer-review of the work. The peer-review is done publicly, online, and on an ongoing basis. The expert conducting the peer review discloses their name and any vested interests, abandoning the double-blind, anonymous peer-review system that is typical in academic publishing. Additionally, other organizations like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (platform Gates Open Research) and the European Commission (platform Open Research Europe) contract out the development and support of their own open-access publishing systems to F1000.

It publishes articles and &quot;collections&quot; of other research content such as presentations. Users can filter articles to see only those that have passed peer review. In January 2020, the publisher Taylor &amp; Francis bought &quot;F1000Research&quot;.

===Previous services===
F1000 used to operate Faculty Opinions, formerly known as &quot;F1000Prime&quot;, until F1000 was acquired by Taylor &amp; Francis in 2020. The founder of F1000 remained the owner of Prime, which he subsequently sold to tech company H1 in February 2022. Faculty Opinions draws attention to scientific works that are well-rated by F1000&#x27;s experts. The Faculty Opinions ranking system further provides an alternative article highlighting system from the use of article impact metrics like total citation count. Faculty Opinions experts nominate primary research papers they felt were important or interesting, write a description of the work&#x27;s significance, then link to where the work was originally published.

Sciwheel, formerly F1000Workspace, was a citation manager platform previously operated by F1000. SciWheel also offered article recommendations based on a user&#x27;s existing reference library. After the acquisition, it was owned by F1000 founder Vitek Tracz, before being acquired by SAGE Publishing in 2022.

<text>Kuruman is a small town in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. It is known for its scenery and the Eye of Kuruman, a geological feature that brings water from deep underground. The abundance of water produces an unexpected swathe of green amidst the barren plains and is known as the &quot;Oasis of the Kalahari&quot;. It was at first a mission station of the London Missionary Society founded by Robert Moffat in 1821. It was also the place where David Livingstone arrived for his first position as a missionary in 1841. The Kuruman River, which is dry except for flash floods after heavy rain, is named after the town.
==Origins==
Kuruman is regarded as the &quot;Oasis of the Kalahari&quot;. It is set out on the Ghaap Plateau and receives its water source from a spring called &quot;The Eye&quot; which rises in a cave in the semidesert thornveld area in the Kalahari region. Kuruman is the main town in the area and the spring gives about 20 to 30 million litres of water daily to approximately 10 000 inhabitants. It is also known as &quot;Die Oog&quot; or &quot;Gasegonyane&quot; in the Kalahari region.

The name Kuruman is derived from the Chief who lived in the area, named Kudumane. Robert Moffat, a missionary from the London Missionary Society, also lived there from 1820 to 1870. Moffat helped build the Moffat Church which was completed in 1838 and is still used for regular church services. While living in Kuruman, Moffat translated the bible into the Tswana language: this was the second bible in an indigenous southern African language.

==Location and climate==
Kuruman is situated on the main route between Gauteng and Namibia/Cape Town via Upington. The route is growing in popularity because of its beautiful nature and various tourist attractions. Kuruman lies virtually on the edge of the Kalahari at the foot of a range of low hills. It has relatively mild weather patterns compared to other Northern Cape towns, such as Upington and Springbok, and is surrounded by more vegetation than Upington and Springbok, which are mostly semi-arid to desert environments.

==Economy==

Mining and agriculture (cattle and game) support Kuruman&#x27;s thriving economy. Minerals mined in Kuruman include manganese, iron ore, tiger&#x27;s eye and crocidolite. The richest deposits of crocidolite in the world are found in the Kuruman district.

== Attractions ==

===The Eye of Kuruman===

This is a natural fountain delivering approximately of crystal clear water daily which supplies domestic water, feeds the Kuruman River and spills more water into two irrigation canals which are in length. The Eye was claimed to have been discovered in 1801 and this led to the establishment of the mission station in the early 19th century. The Eye then came to be described as &quot;The fountain of Christianity&quot;. It is the biggest natural fountain in the Southern Hemisphere. In the early years, Tswana people called this fountain &quot;Gasegonyane&quot; which means &quot;small water calabash with bubbling water&quot;.
