<text>George Corley Wallace Jr. (August 25, 1919 – September 13, 1998) was the 45th governor of Alabama, serving from 1963 to 1967, again from 1971 to 1979, and finally from 1983 to 1987. He is remembered for his staunch segregationist and populist views; however, in the late 1970s, Wallace moderated his views on race, renouncing his support for segregation. During Wallace&#x27;s tenure as governor of Alabama, he promoted &quot;industrial development, low taxes, and trade schools.&quot; Wallace unsuccessfully sought the United States presidency as a Democratic Party candidate three times, and once as an American Independent Party candidate, carrying five states in the 1968 election. Wallace opposed desegregation and supported the policies of &quot;Jim Crow&quot; during the Civil Rights Movement, declaring in his infamous 1963 inaugural address that he stood for &quot;segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever&quot;.

Born in Clio, Alabama, Wallace attended the University of Alabama School of Law, and served in the United States Army Air Force during World War II. After the war, he won election to the Alabama House of Representatives, and served as a state judge. Wallace first sought the Democratic nomination in the 1958 Alabama gubernatorial election. Initially a moderate on racial issues, Wallace adopted a hard-line segregationist stance after losing the 1958 nomination. Wallace ran for governor again in 1962, and won the race. Seeking to stop the racial integration of the University of Alabama, Wallace earned national notoriety by standing in front of the entrance of the University of Alabama, blocking the path of black students. Wallace left office when his first term expired in 1967 due to term limits. His wife, Lurleen, won the next election and succeeded him, with him as the de facto governor. Lurleen died of cancer in May 1968, ending Wallace&#x27;s period of influence; her doctor had informed him of the cancer&#x27;s diagnosis in 1961, but Wallace had not told his wife.

Wallace challenged sitting president Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Democratic presidential primaries, but Johnson prevailed in the race. In the 1968 presidential election, Wallace ran a third-party campaign in an attempt to force a contingent election in the United States House of Representatives, thereby enhancing the political clout of segregationist Southern leaders. Wallace won five Southern states but failed to force a contingent election. he remains the most recent third-party candidate to receive pledged electoral college votes from any state.

Wallace won election to the governorship again in 1970, and ran in the 1972 Democratic presidential primaries, having moderated his stance on segregation. His campaign effectively ended when he was shot in Maryland by Arthur Bremer, and Wallace remained paralyzed below the waist for the rest of his life. Wallace won re-election as governor in 1974, and he once again unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1976 Democratic presidential primaries. In the late 1970s, Wallace announced that he became a born-again Christian, and moderated his views on race, renouncing his past support for segregation. Wallace left office in 1979, but re-entered politics and won election to a fourth, and final, term as governor in 1982. Wallace is the third longest-serving governor in U.S. history, having served 5,848 days in office.

==Early life==

George Corley Wallace Jr. was born in Clio, Alabama, to George Corley Wallace Sr. and Mozelle Smith. Since his parents disliked the designation &quot;Junior&quot;, he was called &quot;George C.&quot;, to distinguish him from his father, George Corley Sr., and paternal grandfather, the physician George Oscar Wallace, who was called &quot;Doc Wallace&quot;. He had two younger brothers, Gerald and Jack, and a younger sister named Marianne. During World War I, Wallace&#x27;s father left college to pursue a life of farming when food prices were high. When his father died in 1937, his mother had to sell their farmland to pay existing mortgages. Wallace was raised as a Methodist.

From age ten, Wallace was fascinated with politics. In 1935, he won a contest to serve as a page in the Alabama Senate, and confidently predicted that he would one day be governor. Wallace became a regionally successful boxer in high school, then went directly to law school in 1937 at the University of Alabama School of Law in Tuscaloosa. He was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. It was at the University of Alabama that he crossed paths with future political adversary Frank Minis Johnson Jr., who would go on to become a prominent liberal federal judge. Wallace also knew Chauncey Sparks, who became a conservative governor. These men had an effect on his personal politics reflecting the ideologies of both leaders later during his time in office. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1942.

Early in 1943, Wallace was accepted for pilot training by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Soon afterwards Wallace contracted life-threatening spinal meningitis, but prompt medical attention with sulfa drugs saved his life. Left with partial hearing loss and permanent nerve damage, he was instead trained as a flight engineer. During 1945, as a member of a B-29 crew with 468th Bombardment Group, stationed in the Mariana Islands as part of the Twentieth Air Force, Wallace took part in air raids on Japan and reached the rank of staff sergeant. In mid-1945, Wallace received an early discharge on medical grounds, due to &quot;severe anxiety&quot;, and a 10% disability pension for &quot;psychoneurosis&quot;. (The Twentieth Air Force was commanded by General Curtis LeMay, who was his running mate in the 1968 presidential race.)

== Racial attitude ==
While some may argue that Wallace did not espouse racist views, most sources support the conclusion that he was motivated by racist ideology.

For instance, one source on Wallace&#x27;s career as a judge reports: &quot;every black attorney who argued a case in Wallace&#x27;s ... courtroom was struck by his fairness ... But no one who knew Wallace well ever took seriously his earnest profession – uttered a thousand times after 1963 – that he was a segregationist, not a racist.&quot;

A reporter covering state politics in 1961 observed that, while other Alabama politicians conversed primarily about women and Alabama football, for Wallace &quot;it was race – race, race, race – and every time that I was closeted alone with him, that&#x27;s all we talked about.&quot;

Wallace&#x27;s preoccupation with race was based on his belief that black Americans comprised a separate and inferior race. In a 1963 letter to a social studies teacher, Wallace stated they were inclined to criminality – especially &quot;atrocious acts ... such as rape, assault and murder&quot; – because of a high incidence of venereal disease. Desegregation, he wrote, would lead to &quot;intermarriage ... and eventually our race will be deteriated [sic] to that of the mongrel complexity.&quot;

==Early career==
In 1938, at age 19, Wallace contributed to his grandfather&#x27;s successful campaign for probate judge. Late in 1945, he was appointed as one of the assistant attorneys general of Alabama, and, in May 1946, he won his first election as a member to the Alabama House of Representatives. At the time, he was considered a moderate on racial issues. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he did not join the Dixiecrat walkout at the convention, despite his opposition to U.S. President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s proposed civil rights program. Wallace considered it an infringement on states&#x27; rights. The Dixiecrats carried Alabama in the 1948 general election, having rallied behind Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. In his 1963 inaugural speech as governor, Wallace excused his failure to walk out of the 1948 convention on political grounds.

In 1952, he became the Circuit Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit in Alabama. Here he became known as &quot;the fighting little judge&quot;, a nod to his past boxing association. He gained a reputation for fairness regardless of the race of the plaintiff. It was common practice at the time for judges in the area to refer to black lawyers by their first names, while their white colleagues were addressed formally as &quot;Mister&quot;; black lawyer J. L. Chestnut later said that &quot;Judge George Wallace was the most liberal judge that I had ever practiced law in front of. He was the first judge in Alabama to call me &#x27;Mister&#x27; in a courtroom.&quot;

On the other hand, Wallace issued injunctions to prevent the removal of segregation signs in rail terminals, becoming the first Southern judge to do so. Similarly, during efforts by civil rights organizations to expand voter registration of blacks, Wallace blocked federal efforts to review Barbour County voting lists. He was cited for criminal contempt of court in 1959.

As judge, Wallace granted probation to some blacks, which may have cost him the 1958 gubernatorial election.

=== 1958 gubernatorial campaign ===
In 1958, Wallace ran in the Democratic primary for governor. Since the 1901 constitution&#x27;s effective disfranchisement of Black Alabamians, the Democratic Party had been virtually the only party in Alabama. For all intents and purposes, the Democratic primary, which was a political crossroads for Wallace, was the only real contest at the state level. State Representative George C. Hawkins of Gadsden ran, but Wallace&#x27;s main opponent was Attorney General of Alabama John M. Patterson, who ran with the support of the Ku Klux Klan, an organization Wallace had spoken out against. Despite being endorsed by the NAACP, Wallace lost the nomination by over 34,400 votes.

After the election, aide Seymore Trammell recalled Wallace saying, &quot;Seymore, you know why I lost that governor&#x27;s race? ... I was outniggered by John Patterson. And I&#x27;ll tell you here and now, I will never be outniggered again.&quot; In the wake of his defeat, Wallace adopted a hard-line segregationist stance and used this stance to court the white vote in the next gubernatorial election in 1962. When a supporter asked why he started using racist messages, Wallace replied, &quot;You know, I tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these things that have been part of my career, and nobody listened. And then I began talking about niggers, and they stomped the floor.&quot;

==Governor of Alabama==

===Segregation===
In the 1962 Democratic primary, Wallace finished first, ahead of State Senator Ryan DeGraffenried Sr., and taking 35 percent of the vote. In the runoff, Wallace won the nomination with 55 percent of the vote. As no Republican filed to run, this all but assured Wallace of becoming the next governor. He won a crushing victory in the November general election, taking 96 percent of the vote. As noted above, Democratic dominance had been achieved by disenfranchising most blacks and many poor whites in the state for decades, which lasted until years after federal civil rights legislation was passed in 1964 and 1965.

Wallace took the oath of office on January 14, 1963, standing on the gold star marking the spot where, nearly 102 years earlier, Jefferson Davis was sworn in as provisional president of the Confederate States of America. In his inaugural speech, Wallace said:

This sentence had been written by Wallace&#x27;s new speechwriter, Ku Klux Klan leader Asa Earl Carter.

In 1963, President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s administration ordered the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Division from Fort Benning, Georgia to be prepared to enforce the racial integration of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In a vain attempt to halt the enrollment of black students Vivian Malone and James Hood, Governor Wallace stood in front of Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama on June 11, 1963. This became known as the &quot;Stand in the Schoolhouse Door&quot;.

In September 1963, Wallace attempted to stop four black students from enrolling in four separate elementary schools in Huntsville. After intervention by a federal court in Birmingham, the four children were allowed to enter on September 9, becoming the first to integrate a primary or secondary school in Alabama.

Wallace desperately wanted to preserve segregation. In his own words: &quot;The President [John F. Kennedy] wants us to surrender this state to Martin Luther King and his group of pro-Communists who have instituted these demonstrations.&quot;

Wallace predicted, during a Milwaukee, Wisconsin speech on September 17, 1964, that the office-holding supporters of a civil rights bill would politically &quot;bite the dust&quot; by 1966 and 1968.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; characterized him not so much as a segregationist but more as a &quot;populist&quot; who pandered to the white majority of Alabama voters. It notes that his failed attempt at presidential politics created lessons that later influenced the populist candidacies of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Jack Newfield wrote in 1971 that Wallace &quot;recently has been sounding like William Jennings Bryan as he attacked concentrated wealth in his speeches&quot;.

===Economics and education===

The principal achievement of Wallace&#x27;s first term was an innovation in Alabama industrial development that several other states later copied: he was the first Southern governor to travel to corporate headquarters in northern states to offer tax abatements and other incentives to companies willing to locate plants in Alabama.

He also initiated a community college system that has now spread throughout the state, preparing many students to complete four-year degrees at Auburn University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, or the University of Alabama. Wallace Community College (Dothan), is named for his father. Wallace Community College Selma (Selma), and Wallace State Community College (Hanceville) are named for him. Lurleen B. Wallace Community College in Andalusia is named for Wallace&#x27;s first wife, Lurleen Burns Wallace.

The University of South Alabama, a new state university in Mobile, was chartered in 1963 during Wallace&#x27;s first year in office as governor.

==1964 Democratic presidential primaries==
On November 15–20, 1963, in Dallas, Wallace announced his intention to oppose the incumbent president, John F. Kennedy, for the 1964 Democratic presidential nomination. Days later, also in Dallas, Kennedy was assassinated, and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded him as president.

Building upon his notoriety after the University of Alabama controversy, Wallace entered the Democratic primaries in 1964 on the advice of a public relations expert from Wisconsin. Wallace campaigned strongly by expressing his opposition to integration and a tough approach on crime. In Democratic primaries in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Maryland, Wallace garnered at least a third of the vote running against three Johnson-designated surrogates.

Wallace was known for stirring crowds with his oratory. &quot;The Huntsville Times&quot; interviewed Bill Jones, Wallace&#x27;s first press secretary, who recounted &quot;a particularly fiery speech in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1964 that scared even Wallace, [where he] angrily shouted to a crowd of 1,000 people that &#x27;little Pinkos&#x27; were &#x27;running around outside&#x27; protesting his visit, and continued, after thunderous applause, saying, &#x27;When you and I start marching and demonstrating and carrying signs, we will close every highway in the country.&#x27; The audience leaped to its feet and headed for the exit&quot;, Jones said, &quot;It shook Wallace. He quickly moved to calm them down.&quot;

At graduation exercises in the spring of 1964 at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, Wallace received an honorary doctorate. At the commencement, Bob Jones Jr., read the following citation as a tribute to Wallace:

==1964 unpledged elector slate==
In 1964, Alabama Republicans stood to benefit from the unintended consequences of two developments: (1) Governor Wallace vacating the race for the Democratic presidential nomination against President Johnson, and (2) the designation of unpledged Democratic electors in Alabama, in effect removing President Johnson from the general election ballot. Prior to the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, Wallace and his aides Bill Jones and Seymore Trammell met in the Jefferson Davis Hotel in Montgomery with Alabama Republican leader James D. Martin, who had narrowly lost the U.S. Senate election in 1962 to J. Lister Hill. Wallace and his aides sought to determine if Barry M. Goldwater, the forthcoming Republican presidential nominee who as a senator from Arizona had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on libertarian and constitutional grounds, would advocate repeal of the law, particularly the public accommodations and equal employment sections. Bill Jones indicated that Wallace agreed with Goldwater&#x27;s anti-communist stance but opposed the Republican&#x27;s proposal to make Social Security a voluntary program. Jones stressed that Wallace had sacrificed his own presidential aspirations that year to allow a direct Republican challenge to President Johnson. It was later disclosed that Wallace proposed at the meeting with Martin to switch parties if he could be named as Goldwater&#x27;s running-mate, a designation later given to U.S. Representative William E. Miller of New York. Goldwater reportedly rejected the overture because he considered Wallace to be a racist.

The unpledged electors in Alabama included the future U.S. senator, James Allen, then the lieutenant governor, and the subsequent Governor Albert Brewer, then the state House Speaker. National Democrats balked over Johnson&#x27;s exclusion from the ballot, but most supported the unpledged slate, which competed directly with the Republican electors. As &quot;The Tuscaloosa News&quot; explained, loyalist electors would have offered a clearer choice to voters than did the unpledged slate.

The 1964 Republican electors were the first since Reconstruction to prevail in Alabama. The Goldwater-Miller slate received 479,085 votes (69.5 percent) to the unpledged electors&#x27; 209,848 (30.5 percent). The Republican tide also brought to victory five Republican members of the United States House of Representatives, including William Louis Dickinson, who held the Montgomery-based district seat until 1993, and James D. Martin, the Gadsden oil products dealer who defeated then State Senator George C. Hawkins for the U.S. House seat formerly held by Carl Elliott. Hardly yet sworn into the U.S. House, Martin already had his eyes on Wallace&#x27;s own position as governor.

==First Gentleman of Alabama==
Term limits in the Alabama Constitution prevented Wallace from seeking a second term in 1966. Therefore, Wallace offered his wife, Lurleen Wallace, as a surrogate candidate for governor. In the Democratic primary, she defeated two former governors, Jim Folsom and John M. Patterson, Attorney General Richmond Flowers Sr., and former U.S. Representative Carl Elliott. Largely through the work of Wallace&#x27;s supporters, the Alabama restriction on gubernatorial succession was later modified to allow two consecutive terms.

Wallace defended his wife&#x27;s proxy candidacy. He felt somewhat vindicated when Republicans in Idaho denied renomination in 1966 to Governor Robert E. Smylie, author of the article entitled &quot;Why I Feel Sorry for Lurleen Wallace&quot;. In his memoirs, Wallace recounts his wife&#x27;s ability to &quot;charm crowds&quot; and cast-off invective: &quot;I was immensely proud of her, and it didn&#x27;t hurt a bit to take a back seat to her in vote-getting ability.&quot; Wallace rebuffed critics who claimed that he had &quot;dragooned&quot; his wife into the race. &quot;She loved every minute of being governor the same way ... that Mrs. (Margaret) Smith loves being senator.&quot;

During the 1966 campaign, George Wallace signed state legislation to nullify desegregation guidelines between Alabama cities and counties and the former United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Wallace claimed that the law would thwart the national government from intervening in schools. Critics denounced Wallace&#x27;s &quot;political trickery&quot; and expressed alarm at the potential forfeiture of federal funds. Republican gubernatorial candidate James D. Martin accused the Democrats of &quot;playing politics with your children&quot; and &quot;neglecting academic excellence&quot;.

Martin also opposed the desegregation guidelines and had sponsored a U.S. House amendment to forbid the placement of students and teachers on the basis of racial quotas. He predicted that Wallace&#x27;s legislation would propel the issuance of a court order compelling immediate and total desegregation in all public schools. He also compared the new Alabama law to &quot;another two-and-a-half-minute stand in the schoolhouse door&quot;.

Lurleen Wallace defeated Martin in the general election on November 8, 1966. She was inaugurated in January 1967, but on May 7, 1968, she died in office of cancer at the age of 41, amid her husband&#x27;s ongoing second presidential campaign. On her death, she was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Albert Brewer, who had run without Republican opposition amid the Wallace–Martin races. George Wallace&#x27;s influence in state government thus subsided until his next bid for election in his own right in 1970. He was &quot;first gentleman&quot; for less than a year and a half.

==1968 third-party presidential run==

Planning for Wallace&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign began with a strategy session on the evening of the March 1967 inauguration of Lurleen Wallace. The meeting featured prominent white supremacists and anti-Semites, including: Asa Carter; William Simmons of the White Citizens&#x27; Council; Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark; former Mississippi governor Ross Barnett; Leander Perez, a fervent Louisiana segregationist and anti-Semite; Kent Courtney, a John Bircher; and &quot;a representative sent by Willis Carto, head of the Liberty Lobby and publisher of the anti-Semitic magazine &quot;American Mercury.&quot;&quot; 
Wallace ran for president in the 1968 election as the American Independent Party candidate, with Curtis LeMay as his candidate for vice president. Wallace hoped to force the House of Representatives to decide the election with one vote per state if he could obtain sufficient electoral votes to make him a power broker. Wallace hoped that Southern states could use their clout to end federal efforts at desegregation. His platform contained generous increases for beneficiaries of Social Security and Medicare. Wallace&#x27;s foreign policy positions set him apart from the other candidates in the field. &quot;If the Vietnam War was not winnable within 90 days of his taking office, Wallace pledged an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops ... Wallace described foreign aid as money &#x27;poured down a rat hole&#x27; and demanded that European and Asian allies pay more for their defense.&quot;

Richard Nixon feared that Wallace might split the conservative vote and allow the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, to prevail. He mostly attracted the Southern Democrats who were dissatisfied with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act that were signed earlier in the decade by President Lyndon B. Johnson. However, some Democrats feared Wallace&#x27;s appeal to organized blue-collar workers would damage Humphrey in Northern states such as Ohio, New Jersey and Michigan. Wallace ran a &quot;law and order&quot; campaign similar to Nixon&#x27;s, further worrying Republicans.

In Wallace&#x27;s 1998 obituary, &quot;The Huntsville Times&quot; political editor John Anderson summarized the impact from the 1968 campaign: &quot;His startling appeal to millions of alienated white voters was not lost on Richard Nixon and other Republican strategists. First Nixon, then Ronald Reagan, and finally George Herbert Walker Bush successfully adopted toned-down versions of Wallace&#x27;s anti-busing, anti-federal government platform to pry low- and middle-income whites from the Democratic New Deal coalition.&quot; Dan Carter, a professor of history at Emory University in Atlanta, added: &quot;George Wallace laid the foundation for the dominance of the Republican Party in American society through the manipulation of racial and social issues in the 1960s and 1970s. He was the master teacher, and Richard Nixon and the Republican leadership that followed were his students.&quot;

Wallace considered Happy Chandler, the former baseball commissioner, two-term former governor of Kentucky and former Senator from Kentucky, as his running mate in his 1968 campaign as a third-party candidate; as one of Wallace&#x27;s aides put it, &quot;We have all the nuts in the country; we could get some decent people–-you working one side of the street and he working the other side.&quot; Wallace invited Chandler, but when the press published the prospect, Wallace&#x27;s supporters objected; Chandler had supported the hiring of Jackie Robinson by the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Wallace retracted the invitation, and (after considering Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland Sanders) chose former Air Force General Curtis LeMay of California. LeMay was considered instrumental in the establishment in 1947 of the United States Air Force and an expert in military affairs. His four-star military rank, experience at Strategic Air Command and presence advising President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis were considered foreign-policy assets to the Wallace campaign. By 1968, LeMay had retired and was serving as chairman of the board of an electronics company, but the company threatened to dismiss him if he took a leave of absence to run for vice president. To keep LeMay on the ticket, Wallace backer and Texas oil tycoon H. L. Hunt set up a million-dollar fund to reimburse LeMay for any income lost in the campaign. Campaign aides tried to persuade LeMay to avoid questions relating to nuclear weapons, but when asked if he thought their use was necessary to win the Vietnam War, he first said that America could win in Vietnam without them. However, he alarmed the audience by further commenting, &quot;we [Americans] have a phobia about nuclear weapons. I think there may be times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons.&quot; The &quot;politically tone-deaf&quot; LeMay became a drag on Wallace&#x27;s candidacy for the remainder of the campaign.

In 1968, Wallace pledged that &quot;If some anarchist lies down in front of my automobile, it will be the last automobile he will ever lie down in front of&quot; and asserted that the only four letter words that hippies did not know were &quot;w-o-r-k&quot; and &quot;s-o-a-p.&quot; Responding to criticism of the former comment, Wallace later elaborated that he meant such a protester would be punished under the law, not run over. This type of rhetoric became famous. He accused Humphrey and Nixon of wanting to radically desegregate the South. Wallace said, &quot;There&#x27;s not a dime&#x27;s worth of difference between the Republicans and Democrats&quot;, a campaign slogan that he had first perfected when Lurleen Wallace defeated James D. Martin.

Major media outlets observed the support Wallace received from extremist groups such as White Citizens&#x27; Councils. It has been noted that members of such groups had permeated the Wallace campaign by 1968 and, while Wallace did not openly seek their support, he also never refused it. Indeed, at least one case has been documented of the pro-Nazi and white supremacist Liberty Lobby distributing a pro-Wallace pamphlet entitled &quot;Stand up for America&quot; despite the campaign&#x27;s denial of such a connection. Unlike Strom Thurmond in 1948, Wallace generally avoided race-related discussions. He mostly criticized hippies and &quot;pointy-headed intellectuals&quot;. He denied he was racist, saying once, &quot;I&#x27;ve never made a racist speech in my life.&quot;

While Wallace carried five Southern states, won almost ten million popular votes and 36 electoral votes, Nixon received 301 electoral votes, more than required to win the election. Wallace remains the last non-Democratic, non-Republican candidate to win any pledged electoral votes. Wallace also received the vote of one North Carolina elector who had been pledged to Nixon.

Many found Wallace an entertaining campaigner. To &quot;hippies&quot; who called him a fascist, he replied, &quot;I was killing fascists when you punks were in diapers.&quot; Another notable quip: &quot;They&#x27;re building a bridge over the Potomac for all the white liberals fleeing to Virginia.&quot;

Wallace decried the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s binding opinion in &quot;Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education&quot;, which ordered immediate desegregation of Southern schools – he said the new Burger court was &quot;no better than the Warren court&quot; and called the justices &quot;limousine hypocrites&quot;.

==Second term as governor==

In 1970, Wallace sought the Democratic nomination against incumbent governor Albert Brewer, who was the first gubernatorial candidate since Reconstruction to seek African American voter support. Although in the 1966 gubernatorial election then state Attorney General Richmond Flowers championed civil rights for all and, with the support of most of Alabama&#x27;s black voters, finished second in the Democratic primary. Brewer unveiled a progressive platform and worked to build an alliance between blacks and the white working class. Of Wallace&#x27;s out-of-state trips, Brewer said, &quot;Alabama needs a full-time governor!&quot;

In the primary, Brewer received the most votes but failed to win a majority, which triggered a runoff election.

In what later U.S. President Jimmy Carter called &quot;one of the most racist campaigns in modern southern political history&quot;, Wallace aired television advertising with slogans such as &quot;Do you want the black bloc electing your governor?&quot; and circulated an ad showing a white girl surrounded by seven black boys, with the slogan &quot;Wake Up Alabama! Blacks vow to take over Alabama.&quot; 
Wallace slurred Brewer, whom he called &quot;Sissy Britches&quot;, and his family. In the runoff, Wallace narrowly won the Democratic nomination. and won the general election in a landslide.

Though Wallace had promised not to run for president a third time, the day after the election, he flew to Wisconsin to campaign for the upcoming 1972 United States presidential election. Wallace, whose presidential ambitions would have been destroyed by a defeat for governor, has been said to have run &quot;one of the nastiest campaigns in state history&quot;, using racist rhetoric while proposing few new ideas.

== 1972 Democratic presidential primaries and attempted assassination ==

On January 13, 1972, Wallace declared himself a Democratic candidate. The field included Senator George McGovern, 1968 nominee and former U.S. vice president Hubert Humphrey, and nine other Democratic opponents.

Wallace announced that he no longer supported segregation and had always been a &quot;moderate&quot; on racial matters. This position has been compared to that of Nixon, who in 1969 had instituted the first affirmative action program, the Philadelphia Plan that established goals and timetables. However, Wallace (similarly to Nixon) expressed continued opposition to desegregation busing.
For the next four months, Wallace&#x27;s campaign proceeded well. In Florida&#x27;s primary, Wallace carried every county to win 42% of the vote.

=== Attempted assassination ===
On May 15, 1972, Wallace was shot four times by Arthur Bremer while campaigning at the Laurel Shopping Center in Laurel, Maryland, at a time when he was receiving high ratings in national opinion polls. Bremer was seen at a Wallace rally in Wheaton, Maryland, earlier that day and two days earlier at a rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Wallace was hit in the abdomen and chest, and one of the bullets lodged in Wallace&#x27;s spinal column, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life. No bullets hit his major organs though one narrowly missed his large Aorta. A five-hour operation was needed that evening, and Wallace had to receive several units of blood to survive. Three others who were wounded in the shooting also survived. The shooting and Wallace&#x27;s subsequent injuries put an effective end to his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The assassination attempt was caught on film.

Bremer&#x27;s diary, &quot;An Assassin&#x27;s Diary&quot;, published after his arrest, shows he was motivated in the assassination attempt by a desire for fame, not by political ideology. He had considered President Nixon an earlier target. He was convicted at trial. On August 4, 1972, Bremer was sentenced to 63 years in prison, later reduced to 53 years. Bremer served 35 years and was released on parole on November 9, 2007.

CBS News correspondent David Dick won an Emmy Award for his coverage of the attempt on Wallace&#x27;s life.

== Rest of the campaign ==

Following the assassination attempt, Wallace was visited at the hospital by Democratic Representative and presidential primary rival Shirley Chisholm, a representative from Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. At the time, she was the nation&#x27;s only African-American female member of Congress. Despite their ideological differences and the opposition of Chisholm&#x27;s constituents, Chisholm felt visiting Wallace was the humane thing to do. Other people to visit Wallace in hospital were President Nixon, Vice President Spiro Agnew, and presidential primary rivals Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, and Ted Kennedy. He also received telegrams from former President Lyndon Johnson, California governor Ronald Reagan and Pope Paul VI.

After the shooting, Wallace won primaries in Maryland and Michigan, but his near assassination effectively ended his campaign. From his wheelchair, Wallace spoke on July 11, 1972, at the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.

Since Wallace was out of Alabama for more than 20 days while he was recovering in Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Maryland, the state constitution required Lieutenant Governor Jere Beasley to serve as acting governor from June 5 until Wallace&#x27;s return to Alabama on July 7. Wallace resumed his gubernatorial duties and easily won the 1974 primary and general election, when he defeated Republican State Senator Elvin McCary, a real estate developer from Anniston, who received less than 15% of the ballots cast.

In 1992, when asked to comment on the 20th anniversary of his attempted assassination, Wallace replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve had 20 years of pain.&quot;

==1976 Democratic presidential primaries==
In November 1975, Wallace announced his fourth bid for the presidency, again participating in the Democratic presidential primaries. Wallace&#x27;s campaign was plagued by voter concern about his health as well as the media use of images that portrayed him as nearly helpless. His supporters complained that such coverage was motivated by bias, citing the discretion used in coverage of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s paralysis, before television became commercially available. In the Southern primaries and caucuses, Wallace carried only Mississippi, South Carolina and his home state of Alabama. If the popular vote in all primaries and caucuses were combined, Wallace would have placed third behind former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter and California governor Jerry Brown. After the primaries were completed, and he had lost several Southern primaries to Carter, Wallace left the race in June 1976. He eventually endorsed Carter, who defeated Republican incumbent Gerald Ford.

== Final term as governor ==

In the late 1970s, Wallace announced that he was a born-again Christian and apologized to black civil rights leaders for his past actions as a segregationist. He said that while he had once sought power and glory, he realized he needed to seek love and forgiveness. In 1979, Wallace said of his stand in the schoolhouse door: &quot;I was wrong. Those days are over, and they ought to be over.&quot; He publicly asked for forgiveness from black Americans.

In the 1982 Alabama gubernatorial Democratic primary, Wallace&#x27;s main opponents were Lieutenant Governor George McMillan and Alabama House Speaker Joe McCorquodale. In the primary, McCorquodale was eliminated, and the vote went to a runoff, with Wallace holding a slight edge over McMillan. Wallace won the Democratic nomination by a margin of 51 to 49 percent. In the general election, his opponent was Montgomery Republican Mayor Emory Folmar. Polling experts at first thought the 1982 election was the best chance since Reconstruction for a Republican to be elected as governor of Alabama. Ultimately, though, it was Wallace, not Folmar, who claimed victory.

During Wallace&#x27;s final term as governor (1983–1987) he appointed a record number of black Americans to state positions, including, for the first time, two as members in the cabinet.

On April 2, 1986, Wallace announced at a press conference in Montgomery that he would not run for a fifth term as Governor of Alabama, and would retire from public life after leaving the governor&#x27;s mansion in January 1987. Wallace achieved four gubernatorial terms across three decades, totaling 16 years in office.

== Marriages and children ==
Wallace married Lurleen Brigham Burns on May 22, 1943. The couple had four children together: Bobbi Jo (1944) Parsons, Peggy Sue (1950) Kennedy, George III, known as George Junior (1951), and Janie Lee (1961), who was named after Robert E. Lee. Lurleen Wallace was the first woman to be elected governor of Alabama, which she did as a stand-in for her husband, who was barred from serving another term. In 1961, in keeping with the practice of many at the time to shield patients from discussion of cancer, which was greatly feared, Wallace had withheld information from her that a uterine biopsy had found possibly precancerous cells. He also failed to seek appropriate care for her. When she saw a gynecologist for abnormal bleeding in 1965, her diagnosis of uterine cancer came as a complete shock. Lurleen was outraged to learn from one of her husband&#x27;s aides that the staffers had known of her cancer since Wallace&#x27;s 1962 campaign three years earlier. Wallace continued to make campaign stops nationwide during Lurleen&#x27;s last weeks of life and persistently lied to the press about her condition, claiming in April 1968 that &quot;she has won the fight&quot; against cancer. After Lurleen&#x27;s death in 1968, the couple&#x27;s younger children, aged 18, 16, and 6, were sent to live with family members and friends for care (their eldest daughter had already married and left home).

Their son, commonly called George Wallace Jr., is a Democrat-turned-Republican formerly active in Alabama politics. He was twice elected state treasurer as a Democrat, and twice elected to the Alabama Public Service Commission. He lost a race in 2006 for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. In 2010, Wallace Jr. failed by a wide margin to win the Republican nod to regain his former position as state treasurer.

On January 4, 1971, Wallace wed the former Cornelia Ellis Snively (1939–2009), a niece of former Alabama governor Jim Folsom, known as &quot;Big Jim&quot;. &quot;C&#x27;nelia&quot; had been a performer and was nicknamed &quot;the Jackie Kennedy of the rednecks.&quot; The couple had a bitter divorce in 1978. A few months after that divorce, Cornelia told &quot;Parade&quot; magazine, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe George needs a family. He just needs an audience. The family as audience wasn&#x27;t enough for his ego.&quot; Snively died at the age of 69 on January 8, 2009.

On September 9, 1981, Wallace married Lisa Taylor, a country music singer; they divorced on February 2, 1987, weeks after Wallace had left office for the fourth and final time.

Peggy was 12 years old when her father ran successfully for governor. She has shared that she was not treated nicely out in public due to her father&#x27;s segregationist views. Some people would not shake her hand because of her last name. She would go to school wanting to befriend the black students, but she assumed that they would not like her because of what her father had done.

== Final years and death ==

In a 1995 interview, Wallace said that he planned to vote for Republican Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential election, commenting, He&#x27;s a good man. His wife is a born-again Christian woman and I believe he is, too.He also revealed that he had voted for George H. W. Bush, another Republican, in 1992. His son, George Wallace Jr., officially switched from Democrat to Republican that same year. Wallace himself declined to identify as either a Republican or a Democrat. But he added, &quot;The state is slowly going Republican because of Clinton being so liberal.&quot;

In his later years, Wallace grew deaf and developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Wallace eventually apologized and met with Vivian Malone Jones and James Hood, the black students who he had attempted to block from integrating the University of Alabama via the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door. The George Wallace Family Foundation had chosen Malone to receive the first Lurleen B. Wallace Award of Courage in October 1996, and Wallace himself presented the award to her. The night before the presentation, Malone and Wallace met privately where he apologized for his conduct, and she told him she had long-since forgiven him. Wallace praised her during the award presentation the next day, saying &quot;Vivian Malone Jones was at the center of the fight over states&#x27; rights and conducted herself with grace, strength and, above all, courage.&quot;

When Hood returned to the University of Alabama to earn a Ph.D. in interdisciplinary studies, he started a book on Wallace in 1996 and sat at his bedside for hours of interviews. Hood believed in the sincerity of Wallace&#x27;s apologies, saying that Wallace was haunted by people&#x27;s lack of forgiveness for his actions. Hood graduated in 1997 and requested that Wallace present his degree, and Wallace would have if not for his poor health. Hood instead attended Wallace&#x27;s 1998 funeral.

At a restaurant a few blocks from the State Capitol, Wallace became something of a fixture. In constant pain, he was surrounded by an entourage of old friends and visiting well-wishers and continued this ritual until a few weeks before his death. Wallace died of septic shock from a bacterial infection in Jackson Hospital in Montgomery on September 13, 1998. He had respiratory problems in addition to complications from his gunshot spinal injury. His grave is located at Greenwood Cemetery, in Montgomery.

==Legacy==

Wallace was an unusual candidate who refused to condemn political violence. Ziblatt and Levitsky describe Wallace as an autocratic figure who exhibited a casual disregard for the constitution. Wallace was the subject of a documentary, &quot;George Wallace: Settin&#x27; the Woods on Fire&quot; (2000), shown by PBS on &quot;The American Experience&quot;.

With four failed runs for president, Wallace was unsuccessful in national politics. His impact on American politics was significant with his biographers calling him &quot;the most influential loser&quot; in 20th century American politics. In a YouTube documentary, Pat Buchanan stated that Wallace influenced &quot;Nixon and Agnew, the Reagan movement, the Buchanan movement, the Perot movement.&quot;

The TNT cable network produced a movie, &quot;George Wallace&quot; (1997), directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Gary Sinise. Sinise received an Emmy Award for his performance during a ceremony held the day Wallace died. Sinise reprised this role in the 2002 film &quot;Path to War&quot;. In the 2014 film &quot;Selma&quot;, which was set during the Civil Rights Movement, which then-Governor Wallace publicly opposed, Wallace was portrayed by actor Tim Roth. The George Wallace Tunnel on Interstate 10, constructed in 1973, was named for him. Three community colleges in Alabama are named for Wallace: Wallace Community College, Wallace Community College Selma, and Wallace State Community College. Lurleen B. Wallace Community College is named for his wife. In 2020, amidst a change in public opinion, many Alabama universities were pushed to rename campus buildings that were originally named after Wallace. This included, but was not limited to, the University of Montevallo and Auburn University. The University of Montevallo has been unsuccessful in renaming the George C. Wallace Speech and Hearing Center because the building was named via Act 110 by the Alabama Legislature in 1975.

<text>The Town of Hempstead is the largest of the three towns in Nassau County (alongside North Hempstead and Oyster Bay) on Long Island, in New York, United States. The town&#x27;s combined population was 793,409 at the 2020 census, making it the most populated town in the United States, containing the majority of the population of Nassau County.

It occupies the southwestern part of the county, on the western half of Long Island. Twenty-two incorporated villages (one of which is named Hempstead) are completely or partially within the town.

If Hempstead were to be incorporated as a city, it would be the second-largest in New York, behind New York City; it is about three times the size of Buffalo, which has long been the state&#x27;s second-largest city. It would be the 18th-largest city in the country, behind San Francisco, California, and ahead of Seattle, Washington. Hempstead is the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside New York City.

Hofstra University&#x27;s campus is located in Hempstead.

== History ==
The town was first settled around 1644 following the establishment of a treaty between English colonists, John Carman and Robert Fordham, and the Lenape Indians in 1643. Although the settlers were from the new English colony of New Haven (1638), later incorporated into, Connecticut in 1662, a patent was issued by the government of New Netherland after the settlers had purchased land from the local natives. This transaction is depicted in a mural in the Hempstead Village Hall, reproduced from a poster commemorating the 300th anniversary of Hempstead Village.

In local Dutch-language documents of the 1640s and later, the town was invariably called &quot;Heemstede,&quot; and several of Hempstead&#x27;s original 50 patentees were Dutch, suggesting that Hempstead was named after the Dutch town and/or castle of the same name, both of which are located near the cities of Haarlem and Amsterdam. However, the authorities possibly had Dutchified a name given by co-founder John Carman, who was born in 1606 in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England, on land owned by his ancestors since the 13th century.

In 1664, the settlement under the new Province of New York adopted the Duke&#x27;s Laws, austere statutes that became the basis upon which the laws of many colonies were to be founded. For a time, Hempstead became known as &quot;Old Blue&quot;, as a result of the &quot;Blue Laws&quot;.

During the American Revolution, the Loyalists in the south and the American sympathizers in the north caused a split in 1784 into &quot;North Hempstead&quot; and &quot;South Hempstead&quot;. South Hempstead was renamed to Hempstead in 1796.

Richard Hewlett, who was born in Hempstead, served as a Lieutenant Colonel with the British Army under General Oliver De Lancey in the American Revolution. Afterward, Hewlett departed the United States with other Loyalists and settled in the newly created Province of New Brunswick in what later became Canada. A settlement there was named Hampstead, in Queen&#x27;s County next to Long Island in the Saint John River.

With the 1898 incorporation of the Borough of Queens as part of the city of New York, and the 1899 split of Queens County to create Nassau County, some southwestern portions of the Town of Hempstead seceded from the town and became part of the Borough of Queens.

In 2024, Hempstead sued New York City for implementing congestion pricing in the most congested and polluted parts of Manhattan. Hempstead Town Supervisor Don Clavin argued that the congestion pricing was an unfair burden on suburban commuters into Manhattan.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 191.3 square miles (495.5 km2), of which 120.0 square miles (310.7 km2) is land and 71.4 square miles (184.8 km2) (37.30%) is water.

The western town line is the border of Queens County in New York City. Its northern border, with the town of North Hempstead and the town of Oyster Bay, is along the main line of the Long Island Rail Road and along Old Country Road in Garden City heading east towards the Wantagh Parkway. Its eastern border, also with the town of Oyster Bay, runs parallel to (and several hundred feet west of) Route 107. To the south is the Atlantic Ocean, off of Atlantic Beach, Lido Beach, Point Lookout, and Jones Beach, as well as the city of Long Beach.

The most popular beach on the east coast of the United States, Jones Beach State Park, is located in Hempstead. The beach is a popular destination for Long Islanders and residents of New York. The beach itself receives approximately six million visitors per year.

== Government ==

=== Town government ===
As of 2023, the Town of Hempstead is headed by Donald X. Clavin, Jr. (R–Garden City). The responsibilities of the office include presiding over meetings of the Town Council and directing the legislative and administrative function of that body. The position also entails creating and implementing the town&#x27;s budget. One famous former supervisor was Republican Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, who later represented New York in the United States Senate from 1981 to 1999.
Prior to 1994, the town also had a Presiding Supervisor, who along with the Supervisor, sat on what was then Nassau County&#x27;s main governmental body, the Board of Supervisors, along with the Supervisors of the towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay and the independent cities of Long Beach—formerly a part of Hempstead Town until its incorporation as a separate municipality in 1922—and Glen Cove, which had been carved out of Oyster Bay Town in 1917. Typically, the Presiding Supervisor, besides chairing the weekly county Board of Supervisors meetings, acted as the senior official in the town government with the Supervisor in a more junior, subordinate role; a number of Supervisors moved up to Presiding Supervisor whenever that office became vacant, including, in succession during the 1970s, Ralph G. Caso and Francis T. Purcell, both of whom later went on to become the county executive, and then Al D&#x27;Amato, before he moved up to the Senate. Having the Presiding Supervisor on the county board along with the Supervisor gave Hempstead—by far the most populous of the county&#x27;s three towns and two cities—the most clout on that body. However, in 1993–94, a federal judge ruled that the board&#x27;s makeup violated the one-person, one-vote constitutional principle and also gave no representation to the country&#x27;s growing minority population. As a result of that ruling, the Board of Supervisors was replaced by a 19-member county legislature. Gregory P. Peterson served as the last Presiding Supervisor, as the position was abolished with the demise of the county board.
The Current Tax Collector is Jeanine Driscoll.

==== Hempstead Town Council ====

# Dennis Dunne, Sr. (R–Levittown)

The Town of Hempstead formerly elected the offices of Constable, Overseer of the Poor, Town Assessor, Town Treasurer, Town Auditors, Superintendent of Highways, Overseer of the Public Cemetery, and Justices of the Peace.

<doc id="259901" wikidata="Q245315" url="?curid=259901" title="Liu Bei">
<text>Liu Bei (, ; ; 161 – 10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande (), was a Chinese warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who later became the founding emperor of Shu Han, one of the Three Kingdoms of China.

Despite early failings and lacking both the material resources and social status his rivals commanded, he gathered support among disheartened Han loyalists who opposed Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian and led a popular movement to restore the Han dynasty. Liu Bei overcame a number of setbacks to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, and parts of Hubei and Gansu.

Culturally, due to the popularity of the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Liu Bei is widely regarded as the ideal benevolent and humane ruler who cared for his people and selected good advisers for his government. His fictional counterpart in the novel was a salutary example of a ruler who adhered to the Confucian set of moral values, such as loyalty and compassion. Historically, Liu Bei, like many Han rulers, was greatly influenced by Laozi. He was a brilliant politician and leader whose skill was a remarkable demonstration of &quot;Confucian in appearance but Legalist in substance&quot;.

==Physical appearance==
The historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; described Liu Bei as a man seven &quot;chi&quot; and five &quot;cun&quot; tall (approximately 1.74 metres), with long arms that &quot;extended beyond his knees&quot; and ears so large that &quot;he could see them&quot;. According to the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot;, Liu Bei has been called &quot;Big Ears&quot; (大耳) by both Lü Bu and Cao Cao. Furthermore, an anecdote shared with Zhang Yu mentions that Liu Bei in his fifties was noted to be beardless.

==Family background==
According to the third-century historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Liu Bei was born in Zhuo County, Zhuo Commandery (present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei). He was a descendant of Liu Sheng, who was the ninth son of Emperor Jing and the first King of Zhongshan in Han dynasty. However, Pei Songzhi&#x27;s fifth-century commentary, based on the &quot;Dianlüe&quot; (), said that Liu Bei was a descendant of the Marquis of Linyi (). The title &quot;Marquis of Linyi&quot; was held by:
* Liu Fu (劉復; a great-nephew of Emperor Guangwu) and later by Liu Fu&#x27;s son Liu Taotu (), who were descendants of Liu Fa (劉發), King Ding of Changsha – another son of Emperor Jing.
* Liu Rang (劉讓), a descendant of Liu Shun (劉舜), King Xian of Changshan, – yet another son of Emperor Jing.

Thus, it was possible that Liu Bei descended from either of those two patrilineal lines rather than Liu Sheng&#x27;s line.

Liu Bei&#x27;s grandfather Liu Xiong () and father Liu Hong () both served in provincial and commandery offices. Liu Bei&#x27;s grandfather, Liu Xiong was recommended as a candidate for civil office in the &quot;xiaolian&quot; process. Then, he rose to become prefect of Fan (范) in Dong Commandery.

==Early life (161–184) ==

Liu Bei&#x27;s father, Liu Hong, didn&#x27;t live long, so Liu Bei grew up poor, as, even if Liu Bei&#x27;s claim to royal lineage was genuine, he did not inherit much wealth from his royal ancestors since Han law decreed that each generation of royals must divide their inheritance among all male children, with Liu Bei&#x27;s generation too far removed from his illustrious ancestors&#x27; to provide substantial wealth. As such, Liu Bei was not considered different from commoners. To support themselves, Liu Bei and his mother sold shoes and woven straw mats. Despite this, Liu Bei was full of ambition from childhood. In the southeast of his house, there was a mulberry tree that was very tall (11,5 meters high). When looked from far away, the tree&#x27;s shade was similar to a small cart therefore people from all around the village felt that this tree was unique with some saying that the house would produce a person of nobility. A fortune teller named Li Ding (李定) of Zhuo stated: &quot;This family will certainly produce an estimable man.&quot; When he was a kid, Liu Bei would play beneath the tree with other children from the village. He would often say: &quot;I must ride in this feather covered chariot (emperor chariot).&quot; Liu Bei&#x27;s uncle Zijing (子敬) thought of Liu Bei&#x27;s dream as foolish and that he would bring destruction to his house.

In 175, when he was 14, his mother sent him to study with Lu Zhi, a distinguished man and former grand administrator of Jiujiang Commandery. Lu Zhi was from Zhuo Commandery, the same as Liu Bei. One of his fellow-students was Gongsun Zan of Liaodong, with whom he became friends. Since Gongsun Zan was older, Liu Bei treated him as an elder brother. Another fellow-student was his kinsman Liu Deran (). Liu Deran&#x27;s father, Yuanqi (元起), often gave Liu Bei material support to help him and his mother and treated him the same as his son, Liu Deran. Yuanqi&#x27;s wife wasn&#x27;t happy about this and told him: “Each has his own family. How can you regularly do this?” Yuanqi answered: “This boy is in our clan, and he is an extraordinary person.”

The adolescent Liu Bei was said to be unenthusiastic about studying. However he was fond of dogs and horses; he also displayed interest in hunting, music and dressing in fine clothing. He enjoyed associating with braves (&quot;haoxia&quot;), and in his youth he fought and hung out with them. He would not manifest his anger or happiness and always showed a pleasant face in front of others. Liu Bei was charismatic and all the heroic youth bonded with him.

Around this time, two very wealthy great horse merchants from Zhongshan, Zhang Shiping () and Su Shuang (), met Liu Bei while passing through Zhuo commandery selling horses. They were so struck by his appearance and personality that they gifted him much money and wealth, allowing Liu Bei to assemble a large group of followers.

==Yellow Turban Rebellion (184–189) ==
In 184, at the end of the reign of Emperor Ling, the Yellow Turbans rose up and started the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Every province and commandery called for righteous men to defend the country. Liu Bei saw what was happening and became much more politically aware. He called for the assembly of a militia to help government forces suppress the rebellion, rallying a group of loyal followers, including among them Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Jian Yong.

Liu Bei led his militia to join the local government forces led by Colonel Zou Jing, participating in battles against the rebels with distinction. Around this time, Liu Ziping of Pingyuan heard of Liu Bei&#x27;s reputation as a brave man. When Zhang Chun (張純) rebelled, the Qing Province was ordered by imperial decree to send an attendant official to lead an army to defeat Zhang Chun. As they passed through Pingyuan, Ziping recommended Liu Bei to the attendant official. Liu Bei accepted and joined him. When they met the rebels in the field, Liu Bei was gravely wounded and had to feign being dead. After the rebels left, Bei&#x27;s friend loaded him onto a cart, carrying him away to safety. In recognition of his contributions, the Han central government appointed Liu Bei as the Commandant (尉) of Anxi County (安喜縣; northwest of present-day Anguo, Hebei), one of the counties in Zhongshan Commandery ().

Later, the Han central government decreed that any official who had gained a post as a reward for military contributions was to be dismissed, yet Liu Bei doubted that he would be dismissed. When he saw an inspector sent to his prefecture, he wanted to meet him. The inspector, however, refused to see him, claiming illness. Liu Bei was furious; he returned to his office, led clerks and soldiers to the postal relay station, and forced his way through the door, proclaiming: &quot;I have been secretly instructed by the commandery administrator to arrest the inspector!&quot; Thereupon he bound the inspector, took him to the outskirts of the district, and tied him to a tree. Liu Bei undid his ribbon of office and hung it on the inspector&#x27;s neck, whereupon he had the inspector lashed more than one hundred times with a bamboo stave. Liu Bei wanted to kill the inspector, but was dissuaded by the latter&#x27;s pleas for mercy. Afterwards, he vacated his office.

He then travelled south with his followers to join another militia. Around this time, the General-in-Chief He Jin sent the Chief Commandant Guanqiu Yi (毌丘毅) to Danyang with the mission to recruit soldiers and Liu Bei joined him in fighting the Yellow Turbans remnants in Xu Province. When they reached Xiapi, they met the rebel army and Liu Bei fought hard with talent. As a reward for his contributions, he was appointed as Assistant (下密丞) in the commandery office. Again, he resigned from his post. According to the &quot;Records of Heroes&quot; written by Wang Can, Liu Bei then visited the imperial capital where he met Cao Cao. He joined him as they returned to Cao Cao&#x27;s ancestral home in Pei State, which is present-day Bozhou, Anhui. where they recruited and gathered many people.

Thereafter, the Han central government appointed Liu Bei as the Commandant () of Gaotang County before promoting him to Prefect ().

==Warlord state==
=== In Gongsun Zan&#x27;s service (189–194) ===

When Emperor Ling died in 189, the land fell into chaos. Therefore, Liu Bei raised an army and joined the Campaign against Dong Zhuo. Later, when he returned to Gaotang County, the commandery was overwhelmed by rebels, so he opted to move north to join an old friend, the warlord Gongsun Zan. In 191, they scored a major victory against another warlord Yuan Shao (the leader of the former alliance against Dong Zhuo) in their struggle for control of Ji Province and Qing Province. Gongsun Zan nominated Liu Bei to be the Chancellor () of Pingyuan State and sent him to join his subordinate Tian Kai in fighting Yuan Shao&#x27;s eldest son Yuan Tan in Qing Province. In defending against the governor of Ji province, Yuan Shao he fought many battles with distinction. Therefore, he was appointed probationary Prefect (令) of Pingyuan and later was made the concurrent Chancellor (相).

While he was in Pingyuan, a resident named Liu Ping (劉平), who had long held Liu Bei in low esteem and who was ashamed of having to serve under him, hired an assassin to kill Liu Bei. Liu Bei, however, didn&#x27;t realize the assassin&#x27;s intention, treating him so generously that the assassin could not bring himself to kill him. The assassin informed Liu Bei about Liu Ping&#x27;s plot before he left. Such was the extent to which Liu Bei had won the hearts of the people. Pingyuan was poor and its people starving, so some banded together to commit robbery. Liu Bei guarded against such bandits while carrying out generous economic measures. He had elites and commoners sit on the same mat and eat from the same pot. He felt no cause to be disdainful, so people attached themselves to him in droves.

During his tenure at Pingyuan, Kong Rong worked as the Chancellor of Beihai State (北海國) and was besieged by an army led by Yellow Turbans. He sent Taishi Ci to ask for reinforcement from Liu Bei. When he learned of this, Liu Bei said: &quot;So, Kong Wenju knows that there is a Liu Bei in this world?&quot; Thereafter, he sent troops to rescue Kong Rong and the siege was lifted.

=== Succeeding Tao Qian (194) ===

At this time, an alliance of Yuan Shu, Tao Qian and Gongsun Zan opposed an alliance of Yuan Shao, Cao Cao and Liu Biao. In 194, Cao Cao attacked Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province. In face of strong pressure from Cao Cao, Tao Qian appealed to Tian Kai for help. Tian Kai and Liu Bei led their armies to support Tao Qian. Liu Bei himself led over 5,000 soldiers with mixed barbarian cavalry from the Wuhuan of You province. He also conscripted several thousand commoners.

Despite initial success in the invasion, Cao Cao&#x27;s subordinate Zhang Miao rebelled and allowed Lü Bu to take over Cao Cao&#x27;s base in Yan Province, forcing Cao Cao to retreat from Xu Province. Tao Qian asked Liu Bei to station his army in nearby Xiaopei and gave him 4,000 more troops from Danyang in addition to the troops and Wuhuan cavalry already under his command. Thus, Liu Bei broke with his superior Tian Kai for Tao Qian. Tao Qian became Liu Bei&#x27;s mentor and Liu Bei benefited greatly under the tutelage of Tao Qian who governed like a Confucian populist which influenced Liu Bei&#x27;s future governance. Then, Tao Qian memorialized the court to have Liu Bei appointed as the inspector of Yu province. Liu Bei led his army to Xiaopei, then proceeded to raise troops around the area, and actively built-up connections with influential clans and people of the region. In a rather short period of time, he had gained the support of the two most powerful families in Xu Province: the Mi family led by Mi Zhu and Mi Fang and the Chen family led by Chen Gui and Chen Deng.

The previously mentioned Chen Deng was a man of great talent and enjoyed giving appraisal of well known people. He once said to the scholar Chen Jiao (陳矯) about Liu Bei: &quot;When It comes to those of bold character that are destined to be heroes, those who lay great plan to become hegemon-kings, I respect Liu Bei.&quot; Then he grouped him along with Chen Ji, Hua Xin and Kong Rong as outstanding individuals.

Soon Tao Qian&#x27;s illness became serious and he told to the &quot;Bieja&quot; (別駕; important assistant to the governor of the province) Mi Zhu: &quot;Other than Liu Bei, there is no one who can bring peace to this province.&quot; Upon Tao Qian&#x27;s death in 194, the Mi family backed Liu Bei instead of one of Tao Qian&#x27;s sons to be the new Governor of Xu Province. Mi Zhu then led the residents of the province to meet Liu Bei however he was still hesitant and apprehensive about taking this post. He then consulted Kong Rong and Chen Deng.

Chen Deng told him: &quot;Today the House of Han is in decline and the empire is in chaos. It is the moment to establish merit and to accomplish affairs. This province is rich with a population of one million. We wish to impose on you the post of the inspector and have you assume charge of the affairs of the province.&quot; Liu Bei answered: &quot;Yuan Shu is nearby at Shouchun. That man is from a line of four dukes in five generations. The empire is turning to him. You can give the province to him.” Chen Deng then said: &quot;Gonglu (Yuan Shu&#x27;s courtesy name) is arrogant. He is not the ruler to bring order out of the chaos. Now, I wish to assemble 100 000 infantry and cavalry for my lord. Above, you can assist our sovereign and bring aid to the common people then you could fulfill the calling of the Five Hegemons. Below you could allocate territory and preserve the boundaries. Finally, you could write your achievements on bamboo and silk to be recorded for the posterity. If the inspector does not assent then I also dare not to obey the inspector.&quot;

The chancellor of Beihai, Kong Rong also told him: &quot;Is Yuan Gonglu someone who will be concerned about the state and forget his family? In what way are dried bones in the grave worthy of our attention? As far as today&#x27;s matter is concerned, the people will adhere to men of talent and ability. If one does not accept what heaven offers to him then it will be too late if you regret, it later.” Both of them advised him to form an alliance with Yuan Shao.

At that time, Chen Deng with Mi Zhu along with the others sent a messenger to call on to Yuan Shao saying: &quot;Heaven has sent down disastrous stench and misfortune has fallen upon our humble and small region. Recently, Tao Qian has died and the people are without a ruler. They fear that greedy rapace will one day take advantage of the opening to extend themselves therefore are very anxious. However, they will embrace the former Administrator of Pingyuan Liu Bei as their rightful leader. Hence allowing the people to know that they have someone to rely on. Just now rebel are around all the regions; there&#x27;s not a moment of peace to remove his armor. Hence we respectfully send lower officials to report this to the officials in charge.&quot; Yuan Shao answered: &quot;Liu Xuande is liberal and refined. He is also known as a man of trust and righteousness. Now, (the people of) Xu region happily accepts him; this matches my own desires.&quot; Liu Bei finally took over Xu Province after Yuan Shao recognised the legitimacy of his governorship.

=== Conflict with Lü Bu (195–198) ===

In 195, Lü Bu was defeated by Cao Cao and sought shelter under Liu Bei. In the next year, Yuan Shu led an army to invade Xu Province. In response, Liu Bei led his troops to counter Yuan Shu&#x27;s advances near present-day Xuyi County and stopped him at Xuyi and Huaiyin (淮陰). Around this time, Cao Cao memorialized to appoint Liu Bei as General Who Subdues The East (鎮東將軍) and enfeoffed him as marquis of Yicheng Village (宜城亭侯). This was in the first year of the Jian&#x27;an period (196).

Liu Bei and Yuan Shu had a standoff for about a month without any decisive result. In the meantime, Zhang Fei whom Liu Bei left in charge of Xiapi Commandery (下邳郡; around present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu), the capital of Xu Province, murdered Cao Bao, the Chancellor of Xiapi after an intense quarrel. Cao Bao&#x27;s death stirred up unrest in Xiapi Commandery which provided the warlord Lü Bu an opportunity to link up with defectors from Liu Bei&#x27;s side to seize control of Xiapi Commandery and capture Liu Bei&#x27;s family.

Upon receiving news of Lü Bu&#x27;s intrusion, Liu Bei immediately headed back to Xiapi Commandery but most of his troops scattered along the way. With his remaining men, Liu Bei moved eastward to take Guangling Commandery where Yuan Shu&#x27;s forces defeated him. Liu Bei then retreated to Haixi County (海西縣; southeast of present-day Guannan County, Jiangsu).

However, surrounded by hostile forces and facing a lack of food supplies. Liu Bei&#x27;s army, both soldiers and military officers resorted to cannibalism. Pressed by poverty and hunger, Liu Bei&#x27;s men wanted to return to Xiapi. Liu Bei eventually had no choice but to send an official request to surrender to Lü Bu who accepted his surrender and ordered Liu Bei to return to the seat of Xu and to combine their strength to defeat Yuan Shu. He then prepared the regional inspector&#x27;s chariot and returned his family to the bank of the Si River as an act of good faith. Before Liu Bei left, there was a farewell banquet and everyone seemed happy.

Lü Bu, fearing that Yuan Shu would turn on him after eliminating Liu Bei obstructed Yuan Shu&#x27;s attempts to destroy Liu Bei. At this time, Lü Bu&#x27;s commanders said to him: &quot;Liu Bei has changed his allegiance too often. It is difficult to know what he is going to do and develop relations with him. Soon, you will have to think of a way to take care of him.&quot; However, Lü Bu didn&#x27;t listen to them and even related the matter to Liu Bei. Liu Bei was alarmed and maneuvered to distance himself sending a messenger to Lü Bu with a request to be relocated to Xiaopei. Lü Bu agreed, and Liu Bei was able to safely arrive at Xiaopei where he immediately raised 10 000 troops.

Upon seeing Liu Bei&#x27;s growing power, Lü Bu became worried that Liu Bei would turn against him so he launched a preemptive attack on Xiaopei. Liu Bei was defeated and fled to the imperial capital, Xuchang, where he took shelter under Cao Cao, the warlord who had been controlling the Han central government since he had brought the figurehead Emperor Xian of Han to Xuchang in 196. Cao Cao welcomed Liu Bei warmly, used Emperor Xian&#x27;s name to appoint him as the Governor of Yu Province and put him in command of some troops. Liu Bei then returned to the Eastern front to keep an eye on Lü Bu.

During the year 197, Yang Feng and Han Xian were brigands who raided the area between Yang and Xu provinces and were ordered by Lü Bu to lead their troops to raid Liu Bei&#x27;s supplies. However, Liu Bei successfully lured them into a trap. Yang Feng was killed while Han Xian managed to escape.

In 198, Lü Bu renewed his alliance with Yuan Shu to counter Cao Cao&#x27;s growing influence. Lü Bu ordered his soldiers to gather gold and money to buy some military hores however along the way Liu Bei led his troops and managed to capture the gold and money. In response, Lü Bu sent Gao Shun and Zhang Liao to attack Liu Bei at Peicheng. Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to support Liu Bei but he was unable to rescue Liu Bei and they were defeated by Gao Shun again he had his family captured by Gao Shun who sent them to Lü Bu. Liu Bei fled to Xuchang to take shelter under Cao Cao who brought Liu Bei along as he personally led an army to attack Lü Bu in Xu Province. Later that year, the combined forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei defeated Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi; Lü Bu was captured and executed after his defeat.

Before his execution, Lü Bu tried to convince Cao Cao to let him live. He told him: &quot;Let me serve under you and you would be unopposed in the realm.&quot; Cao Cao still had some doubts. Then, Liu Bei said: &quot;Will you have Lü Bu treat you the same way as he treated the General Ding Yuan and the Grand Instructor Dong Zhuo?&quot; At this remark, Cao Cao nodded while Lü Bu was glaring at Liu Bei and told him: &quot;Big Ears (大耳), you are the most untrustworthy of all.&quot;

Liu Bei recovered his wife and children and followed Cao Cao back to Xu. Cao Cao sent a memorial to have Liu Bei promoted as General Of The Left. Cao Cao treated him with great sympathy. When they went out, they would ride in the same chariot and when they sat, it was on the same mat. Cao Cao&#x27;s advisors Cheng Yu and Guo Jia urged Cao Cao to have Liu Bei killed however Cao Cao refused to follow their advice because he feared that in doing so he would lose the respect of the heroes and scholars in the realm.

=== Role in the Cao–Yuan conflict (199–201) ===

By 199, Cao Cao enjoyed a strong political advantage over his rivals because he had Emperor Xian and the Han central government firmly under his control. During this time, Liu Bei participated in a conspiracy with Dong Cheng, Colonel of the Chang River Encampment Zhong Ji (種輯), General Wu Zilan (吳子蘭) and General Wang Zifu (王子服) to assassinate Cao Cao, after Dong Cheng had received a secret edict from within the Emperor Xian&#x27;s clothing and girdle to kill Cao Cao. Around this time, Cao Cao said brusquely to Liu Bei: &quot;Currently among the heroes of the empire, there is only you and I. The ilk of Benchu are not worth counting.” At this moment, Liu Bei was taking a bite and from the shock dropped his chopstick and spoon. He excused himself on account of a clap of thunder and told Cao Cao: &quot;When the wise said, “If there is a sudden clap of thunder and a fierce wind, I must change my countenance” it was truly with reason. The awesomeness of a single clap can cause this!&quot;

However, at the same time, Liu Bei was anxious to leave Xuchang and be free of Cao Cao&#x27;s control. Thus, upon hearing news that Yuan Shu was on his way to join Yuan Shao after his defeat, Liu Bei requested permission from Cao Cao to lead an army to stop Yuan Shu. Cao Cao agreed and sent Liu Bei and Zhu Ling to lead an army to block Yuan Shu, who couldn&#x27;t pass through them and was forced to retreat back to his base in Shouchun and died there later that year. While Zhu Ling returned to Xu, Liu Bei remained in command of the army and led them to attack and seize control of Xu Province after murdering Che Zhou (), the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao. Liu Bei then moved to Xiaopei while leaving Guan Yu in charge of Xu Province&#x27;s capital, Xiapi.

According to the Wu Li (吳歷) written by Hu Chong, Cao Cao sent loyal men acting as spy to his commanders during entertainments then on some pretext have them killed. Liu Bei often close his gates and concentrate his time to gardening. While Cao Cao would send someone to keep an eye on him. After the spy left, Liu Bei told Guan Yu and Zhang Fei: &quot;How could I become a gardener? Cao Cao is really suspicious. We cannot stay with him.&quot; At night, he opened the rear gate and along with his followers left on light horseback. All the clothing he previously received was sealed and left behind. Then he headed for Xiaopei to raise his army.

Pei Songzhi about this commented: &quot;Cao Cao had Liu Bei lead an army to attack Yuan Shu, Guo Jia along with others were against his decision however he refused to listen to them. The matter should be clear. Liu Bei didn&#x27;t escape because he was growing vegetables. All of this is absurd!&quot; However the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; also gave a similar account with other information such as Guo Jia and Cheng Yu warning Cao Cao that Liu Bei had left, and Cao Cao sending riders to stop him but they failed to do so. It also stated that when he learned about Liu Bei doing trivial things, Cao Cao said: &quot;Old Big Ears (大耳) is really oblivious to what is happening.&quot;

Chang Ba (昌霸) of Donghai used this occasion to rebel. Also, many commanderies and prefectures joined Liu Bei in rebellion against Cao Cao. Soon, their numbers totaled more than ten thousand. In the meantime, Yuan Shao had defeated Gongsun Zan and was preparing to attack Cao Cao in the Henan region. Liu Bei then sent his adviser Sun Qian to meet Yuan Shao and request that he launch an immediate attack on Cao Cao but Yuan Shao refused. In 200, Cao Cao discovered Dong Cheng&#x27;s conspiracy and had all the participants rounded up and executed along with their families. Liu Bei survived the purge because he was not in Xuchang.

Having achieved stability in Xuchang, Cao Cao turned his attention towards preparing for a battle with Yuan Shao. He fortified many key crossing points along the south banks of the Yellow River and set up a main camp at Guandu. At the same time, he sent his subordinates Liu Dai () and Wang Zhong to attack Liu Bei in Xu Province but they were defeated. Cao Cao then made a highly risky move: He predicted that Yuan Shao would not make any advances so he secretly left his defensive position along the Yellow River and personally led an army to Xu Province to attack Liu Bei. Under the weight of Cao Cao&#x27;s attacks, Liu Bei&#x27;s forces quickly disintegrated and Xu Province fell to Cao Cao. Guan Yu, isolated in Xiapi Commandery, was captured by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces and decided to surrender and temporarily serve under Cao Cao. Liu Bei headed north to join Yuan Shao.

Liu Bei first went to Qing province which was under Yuan Tan&#x27;s supervision. Liu Bei had formerly recommended Yuan Tan as a maocai (茂才), therefore they had good relations. Yuan Tan himself led infantry and cavalry to welcome him. Both of them then left for Pingyuan. Yuan Tan sent a messenger to report to his father, who sent a commander to greet Liu Bei and personally went 200 li from Ye to welcome him. Both Yuan Shao and Yuan Tan greatly esteemed Liu Bei. He stayed a month and a few days; soon his soldiers regrouped under him. He participated in the Battle of Yan Ford alongside Yuan Shao&#x27;s general Wen Chou against Cao Cao&#x27;s forces, but they suffered a defeat and Wen Chou was killed in battle.

As Liu Pi, a former Yellow Turban rebel, started a revolt in Runan Commandery (southeastern Henan), Liu Bei convinced Yuan Shao to provide him troops to assist Liu Pi. At the same time, Guan Yu rejoined Liu Bei. When Liu Bei arrived, many among the commandery joined and supported him. Along with Liu Pi then led their forces from Runan Commandery to attack Xuchang while Cao Cao was away at Guandu; however Cao Ren foresaw that most of them were new recruits or Yuan Shao&#x27;s soldiers not yet ready to follow Liu Bei&#x27;s orders, therefore he quickly assembled his cavalry and defeated them. Liu Bei then returned to Yuan Shao and urged him to ally with Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province. Yuan Shao sent Liu Bei with some troops to Runan Commandery to assist another rebel leader, Gong Du (). Liu Bei and Gong Du defeated and killed Cai Yang (), one of Cao Cao&#x27;s officers who led troops to attack them.

Before killing Cai Yong, Liu Bei proclaimed: &quot;I may be lacking in power but even if you were ten thousand still you couldn&#x27;t defeat me. Only Cao Mengde would force me to flee.&quot; Indeed, Liu Bei defeated and killed Cai Yong along with others and fled when he learned that Cao Cao was leading an army.

=== Taking refuge under Liu Biao (201–208) ===

In 201, Cao Cao led his army to attack Liu Bei in Runan Commandery after his victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. Liu Bei sent Mi Zhu and Sun Qian as ambassadors to Liu Biao. Liu Biao himself came to the outskirts to greet Liu Bei and his followers and treated them with utmost courtesy due an honoured guest. He gave him some troops and sent him to station at Xinye County in northern Jing Province to guard against Cao Cao&#x27;s advances. Soon many men of talents joined Liu Bei and his rank greatly increased. Liu Biao didn&#x27;t trust him completely and secretly guarded against Liu Bei.

In 202, Liu Biao ordered Liu Bei to fend off Xiahou Dun, Yu Jin and the other officers at Bowang. Liu Bei led his army and set up an ambush. Eventually, he set fire to his own camp and faked a retreat. When Xiahou Dun led his soldiers to the pursuit, they were crushed by the troops lying in ambush at Battle of Bowang. Liu Bei stayed in Jing Province for about seven years. When he was talking with Liu Biao, he rose up to go to the toilet. Then, he noticed that the flesh in his thighs had increased, he sighed heavily and wept. When he returned to his seat, Liu Biao was surprised and asked him about it. Liu Bei replied: &quot;When I was younger, I&#x27;ve never left the saddle. My thighs were thin. Now I do not ride anymore, they have grown. The days and months pass like a stream, and old age will come, but I have achieved nothing. That&#x27;s why I am sad.&quot;

Once, Liu Bei camped at Fancheng with his soldiers. Liu Biao was friendly to him however he was also anxious about Liu Bei&#x27;s conduct and did not place much trust in him. One day, had asked Liu Bei to join him for a banquet. Kuai Yue and Cai Mao however wanted to use this as an occasion to kill him. Liu Bei saw through this, pretended to go to the toilet and nimbly escaped. His horse was named Dilu (的盧), and he quickly rode him. However, during the pursuit, he fell into the waters of the Tan Stream west of Xiangyang city. Liu Bei was drowning and couldn&#x27;t get away from the river. He then cried: &quot;Dilu! Today I&#x27;m in dire straits! Give it your all!&quot; Dilu then jumped three zhang (7 meters) in a single leap and thus both of them got across. Quickly they found a ferry and crossed the river. While they were at half of the river, the pursuers caught up to them and could only apologize on Liu Biao&#x27;s behalf.

In 207, Cao Cao planned a campaign to conquer the Wuhuan in the north but was apprehensive that Liu Biao might attack his base, however he was assured by Guo Jia that Liu Biao would not do so for fear of Liu Bei being more powerful than he was. Cao Cao agreed, and Guo Jia&#x27;s point was proven later, when Liu Biao refused to attack Xu when Liu Bei advised him to do so. When Cao Cao returned from Liucheng. Liu Biao told to Liu Bei: &quot;I didn&#x27;t adopt your proposal and now I lost this great opportunity.&quot; Liu Bei answered: “Now the empire is in chaos and every day there are battles. What seem to be a good opportunity may present himself later. If you are able to respond to them accordingly then this isn&#x27;t worth regret.&quot;
Away from the battlefields in the east and under Liu Biao&#x27;s efficient rule, Jing Province was prosperous and a popular destination for literati fleeing from the destruction of war. Liu Bei asked Sima Hui, a revered recluse, about scholars. Sima Hui&#x27;s friend Pan Degong named Zhuge Liang and Pang Tong as exceptional talents who could comprehend important events of their time well. Xu Shu also urged Liu Bei to call on Zhuge Liang. Liu Bei went to see Zhuge Liang and finally had an audience with him after three visits. Zhuge Liang presented Liu Bei with his Longzhong Plan, a general long-term plan outlining the takeover of Jing Province and Yi Province to set up a two-pronged final strike at the imperial capital.

Liu Bei was greatly pleased and became a closer colleague of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s each day saying that he felt like a fish that has found water.

According to the &quot;Wei Shu&quot; (魏書), when Liu Biao saw that his illness was serious, he planned to entrust Liu Bei with Jing province. Liu Biao told him: &quot;My sons lack talent while all the generals are not up to the task. After my death, I wish for you to be in charge of this province.&quot; Liu Bei answered: &quot;Your sons are all wise. I hope your Lordship recover from your illness.&quot; Among Liu Bei&#x27;s retinue, some advised him to follow Liu Biao&#x27;s suggestion. However Liu Bei told them: &quot;Liu Biao treats me with generosity. If I followed this proposal, people would believe that I&#x27;m just looking after personal gains. I couldn’t bear that.&quot; The &quot;Records of Heroes&quot; also mentioned that when Liu Biao was ill, he sent a memorial to have Liu Bei promoted to Governor of Jing province.

Pei Songzhi believed that as Liu Biao and his wife already had decided to remove the eldest son from the succession for a younger one they favoured, there would be no reason for him to provide Jing province to Liu Bei. Therefore, he said that those were incorrect statements.

Liu Biao died in 208 and his younger son Liu Cong succeeded him and surrendered to Cao Cao without informing Liu Bei. By the time Liu Bei heard news of Liu Cong&#x27;s surrender, Cao Cao&#x27;s army had already reached Wan. When he heard of his surrender, he had someone close to him ask about it. Liu Zhong then sent Song Zhong (宋忠) to Liu Bei. When they met, Cao Cao was in Wan and Liu Bei was furious. He said to Song Zhong: &quot;All of you act in such an undesirable way and have not been honest with us from the start. Now only when catastrophe is near do you dare to show your face. Are you thinking of me as a fool?&quot; Liu Bei pulled his sword on Song Zhong and said: &quot;If I were to behead you now, it would quell my rage. However, it would be a shame for a man of my stature to kill someone like you when they are about to fall.&quot; Liu Bei sent Song Zhong away and summoned his officers to discuss of the next strategy. Among them, some wanted Liu Bei to persuade Liu Zhong, his officials and the nobles (吏士) of Jing province to flee south to Jiangling. However, Liu Bei replied: &quot;When Liu Biao was near death, he gave me responsibility for his orphaned sons. Now I would have to betray him and his trust to save myself and this isn&#x27;t something I am ready to do. After death, how could I face him!&quot;

Liu Bei led his troops away and abandoned Fancheng, leading civilians and his followers on an exodus to the south. Around this time, Zhuge Liang advised Liu Bei to launch an attack on Liu Cong, so that Jing province could belong to him. Liu Bei answered that he couldn&#x27;t bear to do it. Then he passed near Liu Cong&#x27;s city and wanted to see him. However, Liu Cong was afraid and would not move. Many of Liu Cong&#x27;s supporters and the people of Jing joined him. Around this time, Liu Bei took his leave at Liu Biao&#x27;s grave. He wept at the situation facing Jing province.

By the time they reached Dangyang (當陽; south of present-day Duodao District, Jingmen, Hubei), his followers numbered more than 100,000 and they moved only 10 &quot;li&quot; a day. Liu Bei sent Guan Yu ahead to wait for him in Jiangling, where abundant supplies and an arsenal were stored, with Jing Province&#x27;s fleet. Among Liu Bei&#x27;s followers, some said to him: “You should move fast and then hold Jiangling. Although our force is large, few among us have military equipment. If Cao Cao&#x27;s army comes, how will you stop him?” Liu Bei answered to them: “In coping with a situation one must always consider men as fundamental. Now that men are joining me, how can I reject them!”

Xi Zuochi commented about this: &quot;Although the Former Lord faced many difficulties, along the way his faith and loyalty became even clearer. As the situation became worrysome and danger even closer, his words didn&#x27;t stray away from reason. When he remembered how Liu Biao had treated him, his sentiments touched all the soldiers among the army. When he personally cared for those serving righteousness, all were ready to share defeat with him. Looking at the way he could establish strong bonds with others, how could he not act as such! Wouldn&#x27;t it be appropriate that he managed to bring a great entreprise to its conclusion!&quot;

Afraid that Liu Bei might reach Jiangling County which had military stores before he did, Cao Cao led his cavalry on a pursuit to Xiangyang. When he learned that Liu Bei had already passed through there, he urged his 5000 elite troops to move as quickly as possible. In a day and a night they covered over 300 li and Cao Cao caught up with Liu Bei and captured most of his people and baggage at the Battle of Changban. Leaving his family behind, Liu Bei fled with only scores of followers. He made it to the Han Ford where he met with Guan Yu&#x27;s fleet, they crossed the Mian River to Jiangxia Commandery and the Yangtze River to Xiakou, where they took shelter with Liu Qi, Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son and met up with over 10,000 followers. Liu Qi objected to his brother&#x27;s surrender to Cao Cao and was able to maintain Jiangxia Commandery and Xiakou allowing more of his father&#x27;s former subordinates to escape from Cao Cao. Following this, Zhuge Liang told Liu Bei that the situation was critical and pressed Liu Bei to grant him authority to start an alliance with Sun Quan.

==Alliance with Sun Quan==

===Battles of Red Cliffs and Jiangling (208–211) ===
When Liu Bei was still at Dangyang, Lu Su met him, discussed with him of the situation in the empire and hinted that he should ally with the warlord Sun Quan against Cao Cao. After that, Lu Su asked Liu Bei where he wanted to go next. Liu Bei answered that he and Wu Ju (吳巨) the Administrator of Cangwu Commandery were friends and that he desired to join him. Lu Su told Liu Bei: &quot;Sun Quan is talented and kind. His treats both the elites and the worthies with respect. All the heroes from the south of the Yangtze river already joined him. He also holds the six commanderies, his troops trained and the supplies abundant. You should join him. Now, I propose this plan to you. You should send a confidant of you as an envoy to the east and establish connections, promote the gains of this alliance and together we shall follow the same goal. But you speak of Wu Ju. He has no talents and command a distant commandery. He will soon be under another. How could you entrust yourself to him?&quot; Liu Bei agreed with Lu Su.
Zhuge Liang, as Liu Bei&#x27;s representative, followed Lu Su to meet Sun Quan at Chaisang County (柴桑縣; southwest of present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi), where they discussed the formation of a Sun–Liu alliance against Cao Cao. Sun Quan already knew of Liu Bei great reputation and was impressed by Zhuge Liang&#x27;s exceptional eloquence. Therefore, Liu Bei and Sun Quan formed their first alliance against the southward expansion of Cao Cao.

Liu Bei followed Lu Su&#x27;s plan and led his army to Fankou (樊口). While Zhuge Liang was still on his diplomatic trip to Wu; Cao Cao had already led his vast army from the north and was near. Hearing about this, Liu Bei was afraid. Each day, he sent a scout to learn if Sun Quan&#x27;s army arrived. One day, the scout reported that Zhou Yu&#x27;s army was here. Liu Bei asked him if it wasn&#x27;t Cao Cao&#x27;s armies from Xu and Qing provinces. However the scout reassured him that he recognized Zhou Yu&#x27;s boats. Liu Bei had a messenger sent to them. Zhou Yu told the messenger that he couldn&#x27;t move because of his duty but wished to see and assist Liu Bei. Liu Bei told to Guan Yu and Zhang Fei that after they make contact and established the alliance, It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to them to refuse their invitation then joined Zhou Yu via a single boat. He told Zhou Yu that they needed a plan to defeat Cao Cao and asked about the number of troops he had. Zhou Yu answered 30 000 which Liu Bei felt was not enough. Zhou Yu insisted that It would be enough for his plan and he only needs to watch him destroy Cao Cao&#x27;s army. Liu Bei wished to deliberate with the others. Zhou Yu told him that he couldn&#x27;t leave his post and if he wanted to discuss with Lu Su, he could separately go see him, he also adds that Zhuge Liang would be here in 2 or 3 days. Liu Bei felt disconcerted and although he knew of Zhou Yu&#x27;s talent didn&#x27;t believe he would defeat Cao Cao. Therefore, along with 2 000 soldiers, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei refuse to link his own force with Zhou Yu allowing a position where he could either advance or withdraw.

Sun Sheng about this commented: &quot;Liu Bei was a hero. He put himself in a position of certain defeat and reported his predicament to Wu. After he received their help, there was no need for scout and strategy to withdraw. The statements from the Jiang Biao Zhuan (江表傳) are from the documents of the people of Wu therefore offer their one-sided favorable version of those events.&quot;

Both sides clashed at the Battle of Red Cliffs, which concluded with a decisive victory for the Sun–Liu side. Liu Bei and the Sun troops advanced by land and water until Cao Cao was pushed to Nan Commandery. Cao Cao retreated north after his defeat and left behind Cao Ren and Xu Huang to guard Jiangling County and Yue Jin to defend Xiangyang.

Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, led by Zhou Yu, attacked Cao Ren after their resounding victory to wrestle for control of Jiangling County. According to the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Liu Bei recommended Liu Qi to be the new Inspector of Jing Province and led his men to capture the four commanderies in southern Jing Province – Changsha () led by Han Xuan, Lingling () led by Liu Du, Guiyang led by Zhao Fan and Wuling led by Jin Xuan. Lei Xu (雷緒) of Lujiang (廬江) also amassed many followers and led ten thousand of soldiers to Liu Bei. Liu Bei set up his base at Gong&#x27;an County and continued to strengthen his forces. While the &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; (江表傳) gives a more favorable account of Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. According to it, following their victory, Zhou Yu divided some area to the south for Liu Bei. Liu Bei established his camp at Youjiangkou (油江口) latter called Gong&#x27;an County. Many of Liu Biao&#x27;s officers and scholars who were previously forced to join the northern armies rebelled and used this opportunity to join Liu Bei. Rather than conquer the southern commanderies, Liu Bei believed that the territory given to him was too small to secure his people and therefore received them from Sun Quan.

When Liu Qi died in 209 shortly after Liu Bei secured his position in southern Jing Province. All of Liu Qi&#x27;s followers wanted for Liu Bei to succeed him as the new Inspector of Jing Province with his administrative seat at Gongan which he accepted. To further strengthen the Sun–Liu alliance, Liu Bei travelled to Sun Quan&#x27;s territory to marry Sun Quan&#x27;s younger sister, Lady Sun. After the political marriage, Sun Quan not only recognised the legitimacy of Liu Bei&#x27;s control over southern Jing Province, but also agreed to &quot;lend&quot; Nan Commandery to him.

Sun Quan sent an envoy to Liu Bei and expressed his desire for both of them to conquer Yi province. The emissary reported to Liu Bei: &quot;The Rice Bandit, Zhang Lu has made his base in Ba and acted as a king. He served as Cao Cao&#x27;s eyes and ears and wants to conquer Yi province. Liu Zhang is weak and can&#x27;t defend himself. If Cao Cao gained Yi province the Jing would be in danger! Now, you should first conquer Liu Zhang then Zhang Lu. The tail and the head are connected. Once we united Wu and Chu even if there is ten Cao Cao, there would be no need for worry.&quot;

Liu Bei&#x27;s officers thought Liu Bei should conquer this land alone since Sun Quan couldn&#x27;t extend his land beyond Jing province. Yin Guan (殷觀) at this time was master of records of Jing province, he said: &quot;If you act as the vanguard for Sun Quan and moved your army but fall to conquer Yi province then while you are away, Sun Quan could use this to his advantage, and everything would be lost! For the time being, you should only encourage his attack on Yi while you explain that you recently conquered several commanderies and cannot act yet. Sun Quan would not dare to pass through us to take Yi alone. With such a strategy of advance and withdrawal, you can reap both the benefits of Sun Quan and the Yi province.” Liu Bei agreed and followed this plan, he then had Yin Guan promoted to be mounted escort attendant.

And so, Liu Bei answered to Sun Quan: &quot;The people of Yi province are strong and rich moreover the land is hard to conquer. Even if Liu Zhang is weak, he can defend himself. Zhang Lu is crafty and may not be loyal to Cao Cao. Now with the fierce soldiers of Yi and the complicate terrain, the battle is far harder and may be something that Wu Qi couldn&#x27;t accomplish even less an officer of Sun. Even if Cao Cao wanted to destitute the emperor, he still is officially his protector. And when the civils saw his defeat at Cibhi, they said that his ambition was over, and his power ended. However, he already possesses two thirds of the empire, and he surely wants to take his horse to the farest of the world and led his army to Wu-Gui Commanderies. Why would he allow us to expend ourselves while waiting for his death? Now if we were to attack an ally (Liu Zhang) without reason, Cao Cao would use this opportunity to crush us while we are infighting. This is not a good plan.&quot;

Sun Quan didn&#x27;t listen and sent Sun Yu to lead his troops and camped at Xiakou (夏口). However, Liu Bei blocked this army and would not allow them to pass. He said to Sun Yu: &quot;If you take Yi then I shall let my hair down, go into the mountains and become a hermit so I would not lose the trust of the empire.&quot;Also he ordered Guan Yu to encamp at Jiangling, Zhang Fei at Zigui, Zhuge Liang in Nan commandery and Liu Bei himself led his men at Zhanling. When Sun Quan saw this, he grasped Liu Bei&#x27;s intentions and had to order Sun Yu to return.

Subsequently, former subordinates of Liu Biao who were unwilling to serve Cao Cao came to join Liu Bei. After the death of Zhou Yu in 210 and Liu Bei&#x27;s growing influence in southern Jing Province, Sun Quan&#x27;s position in the north became more untenable. Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu as the frontline commander of Sun Quan&#x27;s armies and moved the headquarters to Lukou (), yielding all commanderies of Jing Province (except Jiangxia Commandery) and access to Yi Province to Liu Bei.

==Establishing the Shu kingdom==

===Conquering Yi Province (211–214) ===
In 211, Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), heard that Cao Cao planned to attack the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. As Hanzhong Commandery was a strategic location and the northern &quot;gateway&quot; into Yi Province, Liu Zhang was afraid. At this time, the mounted escort Zhang Song told him: &quot;Cao Cao&#x27;s armies are strong and without a match in the empire. If he was able to use Zhang Lu&#x27;s grain stores and launch an invasion of Yi province, who could stop him.&quot; Liu Zhang answered that he was worried but without a plan. Zhang Song answered: &quot;Liu Bei is of the same clan as you and he is an unstoppable rival of Cao Cao. He commands troops with talent. If we used him to conquer Zhang Lu, Zhang Lu would surely be defeated. With Zhang Lu vanquished, Yi province would be safe and even if Cao Cao were to come, he would be defeated.&quot;

After listening to the advice from Zhang Song, Liu Zhang sent Fa Zheng with 4000 men to form an alliance with Liu Bei and presented him with many expensive gifts. Zhang Song and Fa Zheng privately disapproved of Liu Zhang&#x27;s governance and looked at Liu Bei as a solution for a legitimate successor. When Liu Bei met them, he welcomed them warmly and treated them with kindness. He used this opportunity to learn more about Yi province, mostly the weaponry, stores, and number of horses, as well as other strategic locations and their distances to each other. Zhang Song and his entourage told him about everything and furthermore drew a map of Yi province with the location of the mountains and rivers. With their help, Liu Bei learned all about Yi province. Liu Zhang invited Liu Bei to join him in Yi Province to capture Hanzhong Commandery before Cao Cao did.

Liu Bei led an expedition force of several ten thousand soldiers into Yi Province after leaving behind Zhuge Liang, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun to guard Jing Province. Liu Zhang welcomed Liu Bei, when they saw each other, both of them were friendly. Before this, Zhang Song told Fa Zheng to report to Liu Bei that with Pang Tong&#x27;s backing, they could ambush Liu Zhang at the meeting spot. However, Liu Bei thought that the plan was too hasty for such an important act.

Liu Zhang then sent a proposition to have Liu Bei be made Commander in Chief and colonel director of the retainers. Liu Bei also proposed Liu Zhang to be General Who Subdues The West and Gouvernor of Yi province. Liu Zhang provided him with more troops under his command and have him supervised the White River Army. With those reinforcement, Liu Bei&#x27;s army was over 30 000 men with plenty of weapons and horses. While Liu Zhang left for Chengdu, Liu Bei headed to Jiameng Pass (southwest of present-day Guangyuan, Sichuan) at the border between Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu&#x27;s territories. Instead of engaging Zhang Lu, Liu Bei halted his advance and focused on building connections and gaining influence around the area. He was kind and virtuous and so he soon gained the hearts of the masses

Next year, in 212, Cao Cao launched a campaign against Sun Quan, and he soon called Liu Bei for help. Liu Bei sent a messenger to Liu Zhang: &quot;Cao Cao campaigned against Sun and now they are in danger. Both me and them were like &quot;lips and teeth&quot;. Moreover, Guan Yu is fighting against Yue Jian at Qingni (清泥). If I don&#x27;t go to help him now and he is defeated, then he will invade Jing province and the danger will be greater than Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu is looking to preserve his state. He isn&#x27;t worth worrying about.&quot; Liu Bei requested another 10,000 soldiers and additional provisions to defend Jing Province. Liu Zhang gave him only 4,000 troops and half the supplies he requested. Liu Bei used this as a way to motivate his troops: &quot;I&#x27;m fighting the enemies of the province. My men are tired and cannot enjoy a peaceful life, while Liu Zhang amasses wealth in his palaces but reward merits feebly. He hopes for the worthy and the brave to go fight in his place. But how can he think as such?&quot;

To set into motion their plan, Fa Zheng and Meng Da joined Liu Bei&#x27;s side while Zhang Song would stay at Chengdu to serve as a double agent. Zhang Song was worried that Liu Bei would indeed leave. He sent a letter to him and Fa Zheng where he reminded them not to give up and leave now that success is near. At this time, Zhang Su (張肅), Zhang Song&#x27;s brother, discovered his brother&#x27;s secret communications with Liu Bei and reported the issue to Liu Zhang. Liu Zhang was furious and stunned when he heard that Zhang Song had been helping Liu Bei to take over Yi Province from him – he executed Zhang Song and ordered his officers guarding the passes to Chengdu to keep secret documents and letters to Liu Bei.

When Liu Bei found out about this, he was furious. Before Yang Huai () and Gao Pei (), Liu Zhang&#x27;s subordinates guarding Boshui Pass, knew about Liu Bei&#x27;s true motive, he lured them into a trap and executed them for behaving disrespectfully towards him. He took command of Yang Huai&#x27;s and Gao Pei&#x27;s troops afterwards. Next, Liu Bei had Huang Zhong and Zhuo Ying lead his soldiers against Liu Zhang. When he entered the different passes, he took the commanders as hostage along with their family. He then advanced with his troops and turned to attack Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan).

In the spring of 213, Liu Zhang sent Liu Gui, Ling Bao, Zhang Ren, Deng Xian, Wu Yi and other officers to stop him at Fu. However, all were soundly defeated and had to retreat to Mianzhu. They were killed or captured by Liu Bei&#x27;s forces. Despite being the most trusted vassal of Liu Zhang, Wu Yi soon changed allegiance. Li Yan and Fei Guan were sent to help them at Mianzhu, but they surrendered to Liu Bei as well. Liu Bei&#x27;s army was getting stronger, and he sent commanders to pacify the other prefectures. Among them were Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun. They led their army and pacified Baidi, Jiangzhou and Jiangyang. Only Guan Yu stayed behind to defend Jing province.

Now the remnant force was under command of Liu Zhang&#x27;s son, Liu Xun, and he retreated to Luo County (northwest of Chengdu, Sichuan). There, Pang Tong was killed by a stray arrow, and the siege became a prolonged one for nearly a year. In 214, Luo County fell to Liu Bei. Previously, when Liu Bei launched his campaign against Liu Zhang; Zhao Jian (趙戩) a Wei official who served as a clerk in the chancellor&#x27;s office believed Liu Bei would fall mentioning his past failures and Yi&#x27;s natural defences. However Fu Gan (傅幹) chastised him and said: &quot;Liu Bei is generous and lenient; his men are willing to fight to the death for him. Zhuge Liang is a perceptive administrator able to adapt to changing situations. He is honorable, talented in planning and worked as his chancellor. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are brave and also possess righteousness. Both of them are known as warriors who are a match for ten thousand men (萬人敵) and are his commanders. These three men are heroes. Knowing of Liu Bei&#x27;s awareness along with those three heroes assisting him. How he could not succeed?&quot;

Liu Zhang continued to hold up inside Chengdu. Ma Chao, a former warlord and vassal under Zhang Lu, defected to Liu Bei&#x27;s side and joined him in attacking Chengdu. Although Chengdu&#x27;s citizens were terrified by Ma Chao&#x27;s army, they insisted on putting up a desperate fight against the enemy. However, Liu Zhang surrendered to Liu Bei after stating that he did not wish to see further bloodshed. Liu Bei then succeeded Liu Zhang as the Governor of Yi Province and relocated him to Gong&#x27;an County in Jing Province. The Yi province was rich and prosper, Liu Bei had a banquet prepared for the officers and soldiers. He used the gold and silver to repay them and distributed fabrics and grain to the common people.

Liu Bei married Wu Yi&#x27;s sister and went on numerous public tours to consolidate his control on the newly conquered Yi Province. He promoted Zhuge Liang to an office that granted him control over all affairs of state and appointed Dong He as Zhuge Liang&#x27;s deputy. Fa Zheng as his strategist. Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Ma Chao as his commanders. Xu Jing, Mi Zhu and Jian Yong as his guests. The rest of Liu Bei&#x27;s followers, new and old, were entrusted with new responsibilities and promoted to new ranks with Liu Zhang&#x27;s followers promoted into prominent positions so their talents would not be wasted. Among the talented with ambitions, all competed for Liu Bei&#x27;s attention.

===Sun–Liu territorial dispute (215–217) ===
After Liu Bei&#x27;s conquest of Yi Province, Sun Quan sent Lu Su as an emissary to demand the return of the commanderies in Jing Province, but Liu Bei refused and told him to wait until he took Liang province. Sun Quan was furious then sent Lü Meng and Ling Tong to lead 20,000 men to attack southern Jing Province and they succeeded in capturing Changsha, Guiyang and Lingling commanderies. In the meantime, Lu Su and Gan Ning advanced to Yiyang County with 10,000 men to block Guan Yu) and took over command of the army at Lukou. Liu Bei personally went to Gong&#x27;an County with 50 000 soldiers while Guan Yu led 30,000 men to Yiyang County. When war was about to break out, Liu Bei received news that Cao Cao was planning to attack Hanzhong Commandery after Zhang Lu fled to Baxi.

Liu Bei became worried about Cao Cao seizing Hanzhong Commandery. and requested for a border treaty with Sun Quan for the Jing province with Jiangxia, Changsha and Guiyang going to Sun Quan while Nan commandery, Lingling and Wuling would go back to Liu Bei, setting the new border along the Xiang River. Liu Bei led his army back to Ba commandery and had Huang Quan sent to lead troops to meet Zhang Lu, however he already had surrendered to Cao Cao.

===Hanzhong Campaign (217–219) ===
In 215, Cao Cao defeated Zhang Lu at the Battle of Yangping and seized Hanzhong Commandery. Sima Yi and Liu Ye advised him to take advantage of the victory to attack Yi Province, since it was still unstable under Liu Bei&#x27;s new government and Liu Bei himself was away in Jing Province. Cao Cao, who was not fond of the terrain of the region, refused and left Xiahou Yuan, Zhang He and Xu Huang to defend Hanzhong Commandery.

In anticipation of a prolonged war, Zhang He led his army to Dangqu Commandery (宕渠郡; around present-day Qu County, Sichuan) in order to relocate the population of Ba Commandery (巴郡; present-day Chongqing and eastern Sichuan) to Hanzhong Commandery. Meanwhile, Liu Bei appointed Zhang Fei as the Administrator of Baxi Commandery () and ordered him to take over the region. Zhang Fei and Zhang He faced each other for 50 days, which concluded with a victory for the former following a surprise attack on the latter. Narrowly escaping, Zhang He retreated to Nanzheng County on foot, and the Ba region became part of Liu Bei&#x27;s territory.
In 217, Fa Zheng pointed out the strategic necessities of seizing Hanzhong Commandery and advised Liu Bei to drive Cao Cao&#x27;s force out of the area. Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and others to capture Wudu Commandery (), while he assembled an army and advanced to Yangping Pass. Zhang Fei was forced to retreat after his aides Wu Lan () and Lei Tong () were defeated and killed by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. Liu Bei, engaged Xiahou Yuan at Yangping Pass, tried to cut the enemy&#x27;s supply route by sending his general Chen Shi to Mamingge (), but was routed by Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s subordinate, Xu Huang. Liu Bei then pressed on Zhang He at Guangshi () but failed to achieve any success; at the same time, Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He were not able to hinder Liu Bei from mobilising forces around the area. The war turned into a stalemate, and Cao Cao decided to gather an army in Chang&#x27;an to fight Liu Bei.

In the spring of 219, Liu Bei and Xiahou Yuan had faced each other for over a year. Liu Bei led the main army to the south of the Mian River () and ordered Huang Zhong to set up camps on Mount Dingjun, where Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s encampment in the valley below could be easily monitored. One night, Liu Bei sent 10,000 troops to attack Zhang He in Guangshi and set fire to Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s barricades. Xiahou Yuan then led a small detachment to put out the fire and sent the main army to reinforce Zhang He as he was overcome by Liu Bei. Fa Zheng saw an opportunity for attack and signalled to Liu Bei to launch an assault. Liu Bei sent Huang Zhong to attack the weakened enemy from above. Huang Zhong targeted Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s unit and completely routed it. Both Xiahou Yuan and Zhao Yong, Cao Cao&#x27;s appointed Inspector of Yi Province, were killed in the battle.

Zhang He, who had been informally elected to succeed Xiahou Yuan by Du Xi and Guo Huai, retreated to the northern bank of the Han River, and awaited Cao Cao&#x27;s reinforcement from Chang&#x27;an. Liu Bei knew Cao Cao would come yet he knew he would hold Hanzhong. He secured all strategic points at the exit of the passes linking Chang&#x27;an and Hanzhong Commandery while Cao Cao was approaching via Xie Valley. Liu Bei faced Cao Cao for several months but never engaged the latter in battle, effectively forcing Cao to retreat as many of his soldiers started to desert. Zhang He also retreated to Chencang County (陳倉縣; east of present-day Baoji, Shaanxi) to set up defences for a potential invasion by Liu Bei. Liu Bei led his main army to Nanzheng County and sent Meng Da and Liu Feng to capture Fangling () and Shangyong () commanderies from Shen Dan (申耽).

In 219, after Liu Bei conquered Hanzhong Commandery, his subjects urged him to declare himself a vassal king too to challenge Cao Cao, who was enfeoffed as a vassal king (&quot;King of Wei&quot;) by Emperor Xian in 219. Liu Bei thus declared himself &quot;King of Hanzhong&quot; () and set up his headquarters in Chengdu, the capital of Yi Province.

He designated his son Liu Shan as his heir apparent. Wei Yan was put in charge of Hanzhong Commandery. Xu Jing and Fa Zheng were respectively appointed as Grand Tutor and Prefect of the Masters of Writing in Liu Bei&#x27;s vassal kingdom, while Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong were respectively appointed Generals of the Vanguard, Right, Left and Rear.

===Becoming an emperor (219–221) ===

In early winter 219, Sun Quan&#x27;s forces led by Lü Meng invaded Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province and captured and executed Guan Yu. After learning of Guan Yu&#x27;s death and the loss of Jing Province, Liu Bei turned furious and ordered his troops to begin preparing for war with Sun Quan. In early 220, Cao Cao died and was succeeded by his son, Cao Pi. Later that year, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty and established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the emperor. With some reports saying that the Han Emperor had been killed, Liu Bei declared mourning and adopted mourning clothes. He gave the emperor the posthumous title of The Filial Commiserating Emperor (孝愍皇帝).

Following the rumors of Emperor Xian&#x27;s death, there were many favorable omens and soon more and more officials among Liu Bei&#x27;s court advocated to have him declared Emperor, but Liu Bei refused.

After a dispute with Liu Feng and fearing that Liu Bei would hold him responsible for not reinforcing Guan Yu, Meng Da alongside many of his followers defected to Wei. Assisted by Xu Huang and Xiahou Shang, they conquered Fangling, Shangyong and Xicheng commanderies from Liu Bei&#x27;s adopted son, Liu Feng. Upon his return to Chengdu, Liu Bei was furious with Liu Feng&#x27;s loss and his refusal to send reinforcement to Guan Yu in 219. Upon Zhuge Liang&#x27;s suggestion, Liu Bei had Liu Feng commit suicide. Liu Bei wept upon his death.

In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor too and established the state of Shu Han; he claimed that his intention was to keep the Han dynasty&#x27;s lineage alive. He changed the reign year and made Zhuge Liang his chancellor and Xu Jing his minister over the masses. He established a bureaucracy and an ancestral temple where he offered sacrifices to Emperor Gao (the founding emperor of the Han Dynasty). He designated Lady Wu as his empress and made his son Liu Shan crown prince. Later, he named his son Liu Yong prince of Lu and his other son Liu Li prince of Liang.

==Defeat and death (221–223) ==
In the August 221, Liu Bei personally led an army to attack Sun Quan to avenge Guan Yu and retake his lost territories in Jing Province, while leaving Zhuge Liang in charge of state affairs in Chengdu. Sun Quan sent a letter seeking for peace, but Liu Bei refused. Even though Zhang Fei was murdered by his subordinates during the onset of the battle, Liu Bei was still able to achieve initial victories against the Sun commandants stationed at Wu and Zigui until Lu Xun, the frontline commander of Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, ordered a retreat to Yiling. Lu Xun held his position there and refused to engage the invaders.

Knowing that his enemy was not expecting a sudden strike, Lu Xun ordered a counterattack and set fire to the Shu camps linked to each other by wooden fences. 40 camps of Liu Bei&#x27;s expedition force were destroyed in the fire attack and the remaining troops were defeated and forced to flee west to Ma&#x27;an Hills (northwest of Yiling), where they set up a defence. Lu Xun caught up with and besieged Liu Bei there before his men could recuperate. Liu Bei managed to escape overnight to Baidicheng by ordering his men to discard their armour and set them aflame to form a fire blockade. Lu Xun was unable to overcome the blockade and did not press any further attack. Liu Bei retreated to Yufu County (魚復縣; present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing), which he renamed &quot;Yong&#x27;an&quot; (永安; literally &quot;everlasting peace&quot;). Eventually because of Cao Pi&#x27;s invasion of Wu, Lu Xun and Liu Bei renewed their alliance.

A few weeks before the decisive engagement between the Shu and Wu forces, there was an impressive yellow aura that manifested into the sky. Many saw this as an omen. After his defeat, Liu Bei lamented about this: &quot;My defeat is Heaven&#x27;s will!&quot;

Sun Quan heard that Liu Bei was in Baidi and sent an envoy for peace, Liu Bei accepted and had Zhong Wei (宗瑋) sent in response. When Huang Yuan (黃元), the administrator of Hanjia, heard that Liu Bei was ill, he rebelled because he feared that after his death, his bad relationship with Zhuge Liang would bring him problems. He was defeated by Cheng Hu (陳曶) and executed. Liu Bei stayed in Baidicheng until his death from a serious illness on 10 June 223. On his deathbed, he named Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents to support Liu Shan and encouraged his sons to live well and do right.

Liu Bei&#x27;s posthumous decree to Liu Shan was as such: When he was near death, he told his son Liu Yong to treat with his brothers the chancellor as a father and do their utmost to help him.

His body was brought back to Chengdu and entombed at Huiling (惠陵; southern suburb of present-day Chengdu) four months later. Liu Bei was given the posthumous name Zhaolie. Liu Shan succeeded him as the emperor of Shu Han, while Zhuge Liang later solidified peace with Sun Quan and rebuilt the old Sun–Liu alliance against Cao Pi formally.

==Appraisal==

Chen Shou, once a subject of Shu and the historian who wrote Liu Bei&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), appraised Liu Bei as follows:

Chang Qu, historian and compiler of the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; in the fourth-century later used by Pei Songzhi in his annotations to the historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; also gave his appraisal of Liu Bei:

However, the opinions of modern historians are more negative. As Rafe de Crespigny writes in &quot;Fire over Luoyang: A History of the Later Han Dynasty 23–220 AD&quot;:

Rafe de Crespigny also gave a more neutral appraisal of Liu Bei in &quot;A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23–220 AD)&quot;:

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; is a 14th-century historical novel which romanticises the historical figures and events before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Written by Luo Guanzhong more than 1,000 years after the Three Kingdoms period, the novel incorporates many popular folklore and opera scripts into the character of Liu Bei, portraying him as a benevolent and righteous leader, endowed with charismatic potency (called &quot;de&quot; 德 in Chinese) who builds his state on the basis of Confucian values. This is in line with the historical background of the times during which the novel was written. Furthermore, the novel emphasises that Liu Bei was related, however distantly, to the imperial family of the Han dynasty, thus favouring another argument for the legitimacy of Liu Bei&#x27;s reign.

&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; gives additional features Liu Bei&#x27;s physical appearance. It mentions that Liu Bei is seven &quot;chi&quot; and five &quot;cun&quot; tall, with ears so large that they touch his shoulders and that he can even see them, long arms that extend beyond his knees, a fair and jade like face, and lips so red that it seems as though he is wearing lipstick. He wields a pair of double edged swords called &quot;shuang gu jian&quot; ().

See the following for some fictitious stories in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; involving Liu Bei:
* Oath of the Peach Garden
* Battle of Hulao Pass
* The Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage

==General worship of Liu Bei==

Liu Bei is worshipped as the patron of shoemakers in Chengdu. It is said that in 1845, during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor in the Qing dynasty, the shoemakers guild in Chengdu, who called themselves &quot;disciples of Liu Bei&quot;, sponsored the construction of the Sanyi Temple in Liu Bei&#x27;s honour. After being relocated many times, the temple can be found in Wuhou District today.

Since the Chinese government loosened its control on religious practices in recent years, the worship of Liu Bei among shoemakers has again gained popularity in Chengdu. In 2005, a large procession was carried out in front of the Sanyi Temple to commemorate Liu Bei – the first such event since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949.

A commentary carried by the &quot;Yangtse Evening Post&quot; criticised such practice as mere commercial gimmickry to exploit the fame of Liu Bei. It argued that although Liu Bei sold straw-woven shoes and mats for a living when he was young, he was hardly the inventor of shoes. According to legend, it was Yu Ze who made the first pairs of shoes with softwood during the time of the Yellow Emperor. However, the criticism did not dampen the enthusiastic shoe industry owners in their decision to erect a statue of Liu Bei in the West China Shoe Center Industrial Zone, which was still under construction in Wuhou District as of August 2005.

==In popular culture==
===Film and television===
Notable actors who have portrayed Liu Bei in films and television series include: Sun Yanjun in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1994); Chang Fu-chien in &quot;Guan Gong&quot; (1996); Elliot Ngok in &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot; (2008); You Yong in &quot;Red Cliff&quot; (2008–09); Yu Hewei in &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; (2010); Alex Fong in &quot;The Lost Bladesman&quot; (2011); Yan Yikuan in &quot;God of War, Zhao Yun&quot; (2016); Tony Yang in &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; (2019).

===Card games===
In the collectible card game &quot;&quot; there is a card named &quot;Liu Bei, Lord of Shu&quot; in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set. In the selection of hero cards in the Chinese card game &quot;San Guo Sha&quot;, there is also a &quot;Liu Bei&quot; card that players can select at the beginning of the game. In the Roll-and-write game &quot;Shu&#x27;s Tactics&quot;, a hero named Liu Bei appears in chapter 3.

===Video games===
Liu Bei is featured as a playable character in all instalments of Koei&#x27;s video game series &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, as well as &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;, a crossover between &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot;. He also appears in other Koei video game series such as the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; series and &quot;Kessen II&quot;.

Liu Bei is the protagonist in &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot;, a RPG on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Released in the United States by Capcom in 1989, the game also loosely follows the plot of the novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

Liu Bei&#x27;s armour (based on the designs appearing in the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series) is available in the MMORPG &quot;MapleStory&quot;. Also featured are Cao Cao, Guan Yu, Zhuge Liang, Sun Quan, and Diaochan&#x27;s designs.

Liu Bei is featured in the sequel to Level-5&#x27;s game and anime &quot;Inazuma Eleven GO&quot;, Chrono Stone, as well as Cao Cao, Zhuge Liang, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.

<text>Lockport is a town in Niagara County, New York, United States. The population was 20,529 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from the series of canal locks on the Erie Canal. The locks lift boats from the lowland of Lake Ontario past the Niagara Escarpment.

The Town of Lockport is in the south-central part of the county and surrounds the City of Lockport.

==History==
Many early settlers were Quakers and helped make the area a bastion of anti-slavery. The Town of Lockport was established in 1824 from Cambria and Royalton, the same year the canal was completed up to the City of Lockport.

Cold Springs Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 44.7 square miles (115.8 km2), of which 44.6 square miles (115.6 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km2) (0.18%) is water.

The south border of the town is formed by Tonawanda Creek. The Erie Canal passes through the north part of the town and the City of Lockport. New York State Route 78 marks the west town line of Lockport.

<text>Lockport is both a city and the town that surrounds it in Niagara County, New York, United States. The city is the Niagara county seat, with a population of 21,165 according to 2010 census figures, and an estimated population of 20,305 as of 2019.

Its name derives from a set of Erie Canal locks (Lock Numbers 34 and 35) within the city that were built to allow canal barges to traverse the of the Niagara Escarpment. It is part of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area.

== History ==

The New York State Legislature authorized the Erie Canal&#x27;s construction in April 1816. The route proposed by surveyors was to traverse an area in central Niagara County, New York, which was then &quot;uncivilized&quot; and free of White settlers. At the time, the nearest settlers were in nearby Cold Springs, New York. Following the announcement, land speculators began to buy large plots along and near the proposed route of the canal. By December 1820, when the exact location of the step locks had been determined, the area that would become Lockport was owned by only fifteen men, many of whom were Quakers.

The canal reached Lockport in 1824, but the Flight of Five Locks were not completed until 1825. By 1829, Lockport was an established village. The community was centered on the locks, and consisted mainly of immigrant Scottish and Irish canal workers brought in as labor. The workers remained in Lockport after the completion of the locks, giving the city a heavy Celtic influence still discernible today, especially in the central and northern areas.

The city of Lockport was incorporated in 1865. The Erie Canal was supplanted by the larger New York State Barge Canal in 1918, and the famous south &quot;Flight of Five&quot; locks was replaced by two much larger locks E34 and E35. The north &quot;Flight of Five&quot; lock chambers still remain as a spillway.

In recent years, public officials and private businesses have made an effort to promote Lockport history as a regional or national tourist attraction. This includes the completion of the Canal Discovery Center, the Lockport Cave and Underground Boat Ride tour, and the Lockport Locks and Erie Canal Cruises. Local officials are seeking state grants to reconstruct the historic &quot;Flight of Five&quot; and make it a living history site complete with boat rides and reenactors. Published reports state that such a living history site in Lockport, marketed as a day trip from Niagara Falls, could draw thousands of tourists to Lockport each year.

The city has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places. They include the Bacon-Merchant-Moss House, Col. William M. and Nancy Ralston Bond House, Chase-Crowley-Keep House, Chase-Hubbard-Williams House, Nathan Comstock Jr. House, Conkey House, &quot;Day Peckinpaugh&quot;, Dole House, Gibbs House, High and Locust Streets Historic District, Hopkins House, House at 8 Berkley Drive, Lockport Industrial District, Lowertown Historic District, Maloney House, Benjamin C. Moore Mill, Niagara County Courthouse and County Clerk&#x27;s Office, Thomas Oliver House, Pound–Hitchins House, Stickney House, Union Station, United States Post Office, Peter D. Walter House, Watson House, and White-Pound House.

Lockport&#x27;s largest employer is General Motors Components, the former Harrison Radiator Corporation, which was founded locally in 1912 and which became a division of General Motors Corporation in 1918. After 10 years of ownership by Delphi Corporation as Delphi Thermal Systems, it returned to General Motors in October 2009.

In 1948, the Lockport Chief of Police denied a permit for a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses minister to preach in a public park using a sound truck. In &quot;Saia v. New York&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the city ordinance as a violation of the First Amendment.

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.6 square miles (22.4 km2), of which 8.5 square miles (22.1 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) (1.39%) is water. The Erie Canal passes through the center of the city, turning south toward Tonawanda Creek. It climbs the Niagara Escarpment through a series of two modern locks. Originally, a double set of five smaller combined locks were used.

Lockport is at the junction of several major truck routes, including NY Route 78 (Transit Road), NY Route 31, NY Route 77 and NY Route 93. It is 17 miles north of Interstate 90 via NY Route 78. The highest point is the bell tower at 452 High Street, with the street itself being the highest street as measured by frontage above the 650 feet elevation.

Lockport lies in area code 716.

Edmund Lee was quoted as saying it was &quot;built not for the aristocracy, but for all the people.” It is designed with a mix of art deco and Italian Renaissance styles complete with wall and ceiling murals. The theatre underwent an interior redesign in 1936, with John Eberson as the architect. In 1969, the Palace Theatre closed its doors, and it stood vacant until it was bought by Granchelli Real Estate in 1972. Although there was talk of demolishing the theatre, the Palace reopened later that same year &quot;under either direct or indirect management of the Dipson Theatres chain.&quot; The theatre underwent restorations in 1973, and it reopened in 1974. By 1999 profits started to dwindle as other businesses began to leave Lockport&#x27;s downtown area and patrons became less frequent. Later that same year, &quot;Curtain Up Productions&quot; leased the space until 2003, when the theatre was sold to Historic Palace Theatre Inc., a community-based not-for-profit organization which has maintained its commitment to keeping the theatre active. In 2021, the Palace Theatre finished its most recent restoration project at a cost of $4.1 million, with &quot;$600,000 coming through Lockport&#x27;s Downtown Revitalization Initiative award.&quot;

<text>Gauss&#x27;s Theorema Egregium (Latin for &quot;Remarkable Theorem&quot;) is a major result of differential geometry, proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1827, that concerns the curvature of surfaces. The theorem says that Gaussian curvature can be determined entirely by measuring angles, distances and their rates on a surface, without reference to the particular manner in which the surface is embedded in the ambient 3-dimensional Euclidean space. In other words, the Gaussian curvature of a surface does not change if one bends the surface without stretching it. Thus the Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic invariant of a surface.

Gauss presented the theorem in this manner (translated from Latin):

:Thus the formula of the preceding article leads itself to the remarkable Theorem. If a curved surface is developed upon any other surface whatever, the measure of curvature in each point remains unchanged.

The theorem is &quot;remarkable&quot; because the definition of Gaussian curvature makes ample reference to the specific way the surface is embedded in 3-dimensional space, and it is quite surprising that the result does &quot;not&quot; depend on its embedding.

In modern mathematical terminology, the theorem may be stated as follows:

== Elementary applications ==

A sphere of radius &quot;R&quot; has constant Gaussian curvature which is equal to 1/&quot;R&quot;2. At the same time, a plane has zero Gaussian curvature. As a corollary of Theorema Egregium, a piece of paper cannot be bent onto a sphere without crumpling. Conversely, the surface of a sphere cannot be unfolded onto a flat plane without distorting the distances. If one were to step on an empty egg shell, its edges have to split in expansion before being flattened. Mathematically, a sphere and a plane are not isometric, even locally. This fact is significant for cartography: it implies that no planar (flat) map of Earth can be perfect, even for a portion of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Thus every cartographic projection necessarily distorts at least some distances.

The catenoid and the helicoid are two very different-looking surfaces. Nevertheless, each of them can be continuously bent into the other: they are locally isometric. It follows from Theorema Egregium that under this bending the Gaussian curvature at any two corresponding points of the catenoid and helicoid is always the same. Thus isometry is simply bending and twisting of a surface without internal crumpling or tearing, in other words without extra tension, compression, or shear.

An application of the theorem is seen when a flat object is somewhat folded or bent along a line, creating rigidity in the perpendicular direction. This is of practical use in construction, as well as in a common pizza-eating strategy: A flat slice of pizza can be seen as a surface with constant Gaussian curvature 0. Gently bending a slice must then roughly maintain this curvature (assuming the bend is roughly a local isometry). If one bends a slice horizontally along a radius, non-zero principal curvatures are created along the bend, dictating that the other principal curvature at these points must be zero. This creates rigidity in the direction perpendicular to the fold, an attribute desirable for eating pizza, as it holds its shape long enough to be consumed without a mess. This same principle is used for strengthening in materials, most familiarly with corrugated fiberboard and corrugated galvanised iron, and in some forms of potato chips as well.

<doc id="259911" wikidata="Q3826299" url="?curid=259911" title="Boonville (village), New York">
<text>Boonville is a village in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 2,072 at the 2010 census. The village is named after Gerrit Boon, an agent of the Holland Land Company. It is located within the town Boonville in the northern part of Oneida County, north of Utica.

==History==

The first settlement, initiated by Gerrit Boon from Leiden, the Netherlands, was made in 1795. The village was incorporated in 1855. The original name of the community, provided by Boon, was &quot;Kortenaer&quot; (after Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer, a Dutch admiral).

Andrew Edmunds was credited with being the founder of Boonville. Edmunds had arrived with Garrit Boon, who is believed to be the first to attempt permanent settlement in Boonville in the spring of 1795. Both men arrived together, constructed a sawmill on Mill Creek, only for it to be completely destroyed by fire when adding a gristmill. As winter approached, Boon and Edmunds relocated to Barneveld to return in the spring to rebuild the saw mills and welcome other settlers on behalf of the land company.

In 1812 or 1819 the Hulbert House was established and currently stands on the town square in Boonville. This inn is known as the first two-story building to be built in the village of Boonville. Although, historians disagree as to which year the Hulbert House was built, they agree that it was built by Ephraim Owens.

In the 1800s it is said to have been the most famous hotel between Erie Canal and the St. Lawrence River. The Hulbert House was originally built as a hotel and inn and has the same functions in current day. The Hulbert House welcomes travelers for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a relaxing overnight stay. While it has changed ownership throughout the years, the Hulbert House is still continuing its tradition which began over 180 years ago.

In the 1830s to the 1850s the Black River Canal was designed and constructed to connect the Erie Canal(Barge) to the Black River from Rome to Boonville - a distance of 25 miles. This section, connecting Rome and Boonville, is known as the Southern section of the overland canal. It&#x27;s constructed of 70 locks to lift the boats and water 693 feet. The Northern section of the overland canal connected Boonville and Lyons Falls, 10 miles in distance and requiring 39 locks to descend the boats and water 386 feet. In all, the Black River Canal had 109 locks and is still a world record.

The Black River Canal had a vital role in the livelihood of the North Countries growth and prosperity, giving it access to Eastern and Midwestern markets to help preserve, house, and display artifacts from the canal era. A museum was constructed. The museum is located on a site formerly occupied by Titus Powers Iron Works, built circa 1850 near the Main Street Bridge. Later this site became the Holdrige and Gilbert Foundry and Machine Shop.

In 1933, a significant clash occurred between the state police and farmers here.

In 1983, a tornado ripped through Boonville.

In 2004, Ethan Allen Interiors, a major employer in the village, closed down leaving many residents looking for work.

In 2020, several residential and commercial buildings along Main Street were destroyed by a fire. Fire departments from nine nearby towns participated in the containment effort.

The Boonville Historic District, Erwin Library and Pratt House, Black River Canal Warehouse, Five Lock Combine and Locks 37 and 38, Black River Canal, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>New Hartford is a town in Oneida County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 21,874. The name of New Hartford was provided by a settler family from Hartford, Connecticut.

The Town of New Hartford contains a village named New Hartford. New Hartford is the largest suburb of Utica, which is located directly north of the town and village.

==History==
New Hartford was settled in March 1788 when Jedediah Sanger, who was bankrupted in 1784 by a fire at his farm in Jaffrey, New Hampshire and afterwards moved to the area.

===Sanger land purchase===

====Common history====
According to the earliest recorded history (&quot;Annals and Recollections of Oneida County, Jones, 1851&quot;), Sanger bought , the land was sold at a price of fifty cents an acre. This land, thought to be separated into two equal parts by the Sauquoit Creek, was part of the Town of Whitestown at the time. Within a year, Sanger sold the area east of the creek to Joseph Higbee, the areas&#x27; second resident, for one dollar per acre. A subsequent survey found this area was .

====Possible inaccuracy====
This narrative of a 1000-acre purchase by Sanger for $500 and the ensuing resale to Higbee of half the land for $500 (a 100% profit) is repeated in &quot;The History of Oneida County, New York by Samuel W. Durant, 1878&quot; which used the &quot;Jones&#x27; Annals&quot; of 1851 as a primary reference. The story was expressed in an address at the 1888 New Hartford Centennial by Henry Hurlburt, again citing &quot;Jones&#x27; Annals&quot; as his source. It is again repeated in &quot;Our County and Its People: A Descriptive Work on Oneida County, New York, Wager, 1896&quot;.

However, a footnote in &quot;Transactions of the Oneida Historical Society at Utica, New Hartford Centennial, 1889&quot;, which documented the 1888 centennial, questions the validity of the story through research of property deed records. The footnote cites one deed for the sale of four 492 acre lots from John G. Leake to Sanger in November 1790 for approximately $1.16 per acre (US dollars were not the currency in use at the time), and another deed shows the sale of one of the four lots to Higbee in December 1791 for approximately $1.06 per acre. Also listed is a deed conveying to Sanger from George Washington and George Clinton for $1.27 per acre in 1790. From the recorded deeds, the land Sanger sold to Hibgee was sold for slightly less than the price originally paid by Sanger.

In spite of the research done in 1889, the original story is popularly told. This version can be found at the Town of New Hartford website and is attributed to the New Hartford Historical Society:

&quot;Sanger traveled to Philadelphia and purchased of land at $.50 per acre on credit from George Washington and George Clinton. The following year he shrewdly sold a little over half the land on the east side of the Sauquoit Creek to Joseph Higbee (Higby) at $1.00 per acre.&quot;

===Other land===
Present-day New Hartford covers over in area, considerably more than that contained in Sanger&#x27;s original purchases. Sanger&#x27;s purchase had been part of the Coxe Patent, land purchased directly from the colonial government of New York.

Other portions of New Hartford is made up of land from the following Patents:

*Cosby&#x27;s Manor, deeded on January 2, 1734, to Joseph Worrell and 10 others.
*Sadaqueda (Sauquoit) Patent, deeded on June 25, 1736, to Fredrick Morris, Lendert Gasenvoort and others.
*Coxe Patent, deeded on May 30, 1770, to William Coxe, Daniel Coxe, Rebecca Coxe, John Tabor Kempe and his wife Grace (Coxe). Daniel, William, and Rebecca were the children of Daniel Coxe, Jr. and grandchildren of Daniel Coxe. Kempe was Attorney General of New York at the time and remained loyal to England during the Revolution. As a loyalist, his property was confiscated after the war and the Coxe patent was divided with General George Washington, General DeWitt Clinton, and Colonel Marinus Willett owning large parts of the patent.
*Bayard Patent, deeded on June 12, 1771, to William Bayard, Alexander Ellis, and fifty-three others

===Early settlers===
In 1789, Sanger relocated his family to the settlement and erected a sawmill. A gristmill was added in 1790. Both mills utilized the water of the Sauquoit for power.

Another early settler was General Oliver Collins (1762–1838), Connecticut native, Revolutionary War veteran and father of future Congressman Ela Collins. Collins settled a farm in the area then known as Middle Settlement in 1789 and resided there until his death. Shortly after arriving, he was commissioned Captain in the local militia and rose to the rank of Brigadier-general at the time of the War of 1812. Eli Butler arrived from Middletown, Connecticut, also in 1789.

John French (1766–1839) arrived from New Hampshire in 1792 and settled another farm, as did Colonel Nathan Seward (1758–1815) of Connecticut, also a Revolutionary War veteran.

Other settlers included Nathan Seward, Ashbel Beach, Amos Ives, Solomon Blodget, Salmon Butler, Joel Blair, Agift Hill, Stephen Bushnell, Joseph Jennings.

Captain David Risley, Revolutionary War veteran and brother Allen Risley, and Truman and Webster Kellogg settled in the area that is now the hamlet of Washington Mills.

There were two families named Olmstead, and a Seymour, Hurlburt, Kilborn, and Montague. More settlers from Connecticut were Henry Blackstone, Zenas Gibbs, Ashbel Tylor, and Nehemiah Ensworth (from Canterbury), all arriving in 1791. The first child born to the settlers was Uriel H. Kellogg.

===Civic formation===
Thirty-nine years after Sanger arrived, the Town of New Hartford was created on April 12, 1827, formed from the Town of Whitestown. Whitestown originally contained all of New York state west of Herkimer, and was subsequently split into many counties and towns with New Hartford being the last. The legislative act was entitled &quot;An Act to Divide the Town of Whitestown, in the County of Oneida.&quot; The early settlers had adopted the name New Hartford for the settlement, and the name was retained for the town.

The first town meeting was held on April 24, 1827, and the following positions were filled: town supervisor, town clerk, assessors (3), commissioner of highways (3), overseers of the poor (2), collector, commissioners of common schools (3), inspectors of schools (3).

Seven years later, the town was enlarged, with a piece of the Town of Kirkland by legislative act on April 26, 1834.

The legislature passed an act on November 22, 1855, transferring a small part of New Hartford, Westmoreland, and Whitestown to Kirkland, enabling the hamlet of Clark Mills to be contained entirely within Kirkland instead of being partly within four different towns.

===Village of New Hartford===
Many manufacturing ventures started in New Hartford after its settlement and throughout the 19th century.

The Village of New Hartford was incorporated in 1870, from approximately of the town by a vote of 32 to 9. On December 21, 1871, the area of the village east of the Sauquoit Creek was reverted to the town.

===Early manufacturing and commerce===

* Carpets: Ingrain carpets were made on the first ingrain loom in the state by an Englishman named Butterfield. Ingrain carpets are a reversible, flat weave carpet popular from the 18th century to the early 20th century. This form of carpeting has no pile and the pattern is shown in opposing colors on both faces, making it possible to turn the carpet over when one side was worn or soiled.
* Nails: The first cut nails made in the state were produced by Jonathan Richardson, who purchased wine and liquor casks and made cut nails from the iron hoops of the casks.
* Tanneries were established by Thomas and Ezekiel Williams, and another by Stephen Childs.
* Paper and textiles: Factories were established for the production of paper, batting, cotton cloth, and knitted fabric.

The earliest manufacturing operations were concentrated along the Sauquoit Creek and utilized water as the primary power source. The power of the creek was the reason that New Hartford had such extensive manufacturing operations for a town of its size. Business in New Hartford exceeded that of Utica due to the water power of the creek. Most factories later transitioned to steam power.

Another boon to the economy of New Hartford was the Seneca Turnpike, a toll road connecting Utica to the western part of the state. The Seneca Road Company was formed in 1800 to improve the main road running west from Utica, NY and operate it as a toll road or turnpike. The original road ran north of New Hartford, but Jedediah Sanger purchased stock in the company and through his influence, the turnpike was routed through New Hartford. The turnpike traffic made New Hartford prosper, outstripping other towns in the area and rivaling neighboring Utica until the Erie Canal was constructed through Utica, removing most cross-state traffic from New Hartford. Utica then grew into a large city and New Hartford continues to this day to be a suburb.

<doc id="259925" wikidata="Q425596" url="?curid=259925" title="Archibald Prize">
<text>The Archibald Prize is an Australian portraiture art prize for painting, generally seen as the most prestigious portrait prize in Australia. It was first awarded in 1921 after the receipt of a bequest from J. F. Archibald, the editor of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; who died in 1919. It is administered by the trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales and awarded for &quot;the best portrait, preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics, painted by an artist resident in Australia during the twelve months preceding the date fixed by the trustees for sending in the pictures&quot;. The Archibald Prize has been awarded annually since 1921 (with two exceptions) and since July 2015 the prize has been AU$100,000.

== Winners==
===Prize money===
*1921 – £400
*1941 – £443 / 13 / 4
*1942 – £441 / 11 / 11
*1951 – £500
*1970 – $2,000
*1971 – $4,000
*2006 – $35,000
*2008 – $50,000
*2013 – $60,000
*2012 – $75,000
*2015 – $100,000

== Additional prizes==
Since 1988 two other prizes have been added to the Archibald prize event. 

===People&#x27;s Choice Award===
The People&#x27;s Choice Award, in which votes from the public viewing the finalists are collected to find a winner was first awarded in 1988. The award comes with a monetary prize of A$3,500. The inaugural People&#x27;s Choice Award prize was won by Fred Cress with his portrait of fellow artist John Beard, which had won the Archibald Prize. This was the first &#x27;double&#x27; win until Craig Ruddy won both awards with his portrait of David Gulpilil (David Gulpilil, Two Worlds) in 2001.

===Packing Room Prize ===
In 1992 the Packing Room Prize was established, in which the staff who receive the portraits and install them in the gallery vote for their choice of winner. The prize-winner is not always an Archibald finalist. Head packer Brett Cuthbertson receives 52% of the vote between packers for the prize. The Packing Room Prize is awarded annually and since June 2014, the prize has been A$1,500.

To date there has never been an Archibald Prize winner who has also been a Packing Room Prize winner. (In fact, a number of Packing Room Prize winners have not been Archibald Prize finalists). For this reason winning the Packing Room Prize is known as &quot;the kiss of death award&quot;. (However, there were two People&#x27;s Choice Awards given to Archibald Prize winners in 1988 and 2004.)

There has twice been a matching Packing Room Prize and People&#x27;s Choice Award winner – although neither won the main prize – to Paul Newton&#x27;s portrait of Roy Slaven and HG Nelson in 2001, and to Jan Williamson&#x27;s portrait of singer/songwriter Jenny Morris in 2002.

Danelle Bergstrom has won the Packing Room Prize twice, first in 1995 with a portrait of singer/songwriter Jon English, and again in 2007 with a portrait of actor Jack Thompson, with the work entitled Take Two.

In 2020 Meyne Wyatt became the first Indigenous artist to win the Packing Room Prize.

===Salon des Refusés===
Since 1992, a selection of entrants not included amongst the finalists has been included in the Salon des Refusés. 

====Salon des Refusés People&#x27;s Choice Award====
Since 1999, Sydney based law firm Holding Redlich have sponsored a Salon des Refusés People&#x27;s Choice Award.

== Young Archie competition ==
The Young Archie competition was established in 2013 for children aged 5–18. Entrants are divided into four age categories.

== Associated prizes ==
The Archibald Prize is held at the same time as the Sir John Sulman Prize, the Wynne Prize, the Mortimore Prize for Realism, the Australian Photographic Portrait Prize, the Young Archie competition and (before 2003) the Dobell Prize. The Archibald is the next richest portrait prize in Australia after the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize.

In 1978 Brett Whiteley won the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes all in the same year, the only time this has happened. It was his second win for the Archibald and the other prizes as well.

The satirical Bald Archy Prize, supposedly judged by a cockatoo, was started in 1994 at the Coolac Festival of Fun as a parody of the Archibald Prize; it attracted so many visitors that it has moved to Sydney.

== History and controversies ==
The prize has attracted a good deal of controversy and several court cases. The most famous was in 1943, when William Dobell&#x27;s winning painting, &quot;Mr Joshua Smith&quot;, a portrait of fellow artist Joshua Smith, was challenged because of claims it was a caricature rather than a portrait.

Max Meldrum criticised the 1938 Archibald Prize winner, Nora Heysen, saying that women could not be expected to paint as well as men. Heysen was the first woman to win the Archibald Prize, with a portrait of Madame Elink Schuurman, the wife of the Consul General for the Netherlands.

In 1953, several art students, including John Olsen, protested against William Dargie&#x27;s winning portrait, the seventh time he had been awarded the prize. One protester tied a sign around her dog which said &quot;Winner Archibald Prize – William Doggie&quot;. Dargie went on to win the prize again in 1956.

On becoming Prime Minister in 1972, Gough Whitlam commissioned his friend Clifton Pugh to paint the official portrait. Normally the Australian Parliament Historical Memorial Committee would have commissioned a portrait. Pugh&#x27;s portrait of Whitlam won the 1972 Archibald Prize.

In 1975, John Bloomfield&#x27;s portrait of Tim Burstall was disqualified on the grounds that it had been painted from a blown up photograph, rather than from life. The prize was then awarded to Kevin Connor. In 1983, John Bloomfield sued for the return of the 1975 prize which was unsuccessful. As a result of the controversy, the application form for the Archibald Prize was modified to make it clear that the subject must be painted from life. Bloomfield later claimed that Eric Smith&#x27;s winning 1981 portrait of Rudy Komon was painted from a photograph taken in 1974. This claim was refuted by Smith and Komon and the Trustees agreed with the artist and the complaint was dismissed on 23 September 1983.

In 1985, administration of the trust was transferred to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, after a court case where the Perpetual Trustee Company took the Australian Journalists Association Benevolent Fund to court.

In 1997, the painting by Evert Ploeg of the &quot;Bananas in Pyjamas&quot; television characters was deemed ineligible by the trustees because it was not a painting of a person.

Another controversy involved the 2000 Archibald winner, when artist Adam Cullen lodged a complaint with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, that it had used his painting, &quot;Portrait of David Wenham&quot;, in a television commercial.

In 2002, head packer Steve Peters singled out a painting of himself by Dave Machin as a possible winner for the Packing Room Prize. It did not win, but it was hung outside the Archibald exhibition. Following that, portraits of the head packer were no longer allowed.

In 2004, Craig Ruddy&#x27;s image of David Gulpilil, which won both the main prize and the &quot;People&#x27;s Choice&quot; award, was challenged on the basis that it was a charcoal sketch rather than a painting. The claim was dismissed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in June 2006.

In 2008, Sam Leach&#x27;s image of himself in a Nazi uniform made the front page of Melbourne&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; and sparked a national debate about the appropriateness of his choice of subject matter. The prize money was also changed to $50,000. It was changed twice more, and is worth $100,000.

In 2020 the competition was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the first time an Indigenous painter (Vincent Namatjira) won the prize.

<text>Elbridge is a town in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 5,476. The town is named after Elbridge Gerry, the fifth Vice President of the United States, and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

The Town of Elbridge is west of Syracuse, on the western border of the county. The town contains two villages, one named Jordan and one which is also named Elbridge.

== History ==
Elbridge was part of Military Township No. 5 (Camillus) created following the American Revolution and given to veterans in lieu of payment for service during the War for Independence. This tract comprised most of present-day Camillus and all of Van Buren and Marcellus in what is now the County of Onondaga in Central New York&#x27;s Finger Lakes Region. The Town of Elbridge was formed in 1829 from the Town of Camillus.

The Town of Elbridge includes two incorporated villages: the Village of Elbridge (incorporated in 1848) and the Village of Jordan (incorporated in 1835).

An 1896 article from &quot;Onondaga&#x27;s Centennial&quot; by Dwight H. Bruce describes the area as &quot;a densely wooded wilderness, frequented by Indians and inhabited by bears, wolves and other beasts of the forest and could not have presented an appearance other than of gloomy waste.&quot; It can be assumed that neither the Natives nor the incoming settlers necessarily agreed with Bruce&#x27;s negative assessment. Before the arrival of the white settlers, the native presence was prevalent and sustained. The Onondaga (&quot;People of the Hill&quot;) of the Iroquois Nation had several fortified settlements in the area. The largest still exists on the Seneca River in what is now known as Jack&#x27;s Reef. In fact, according to some legends, Cross Lake, which forms the northern boundary of the town, was the home of the historical Hiawatha.

In 1791, government surveyor Josiah Buck arrived to map the area. Two years later he returned with his family to become the first Anglo-European settler. Buck was followed in short order by Captain William Stevens, his wife and six children. Town historians believe it is probable that Captain Stevens named the town after Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry, who participated with Stevens in the Boston Tea Party raid in 1773.

== Village of Elbridge ==
The Village of Elbridge was located on a well-traveled Indian trail that eventually became New York State Route 5. Several waterways, principally Skaneateles Creek and Carpenter&#x27;s Brook, provided water power and sustenance. As the town and village expanded with the arrival of new settlers, businesses such as mills, taverns and shops were established. Many industries were located on Skaneateles Creek, including several chair factories and the Amphion Piano Player Company. The Elbridge Electrical Manufacturing Company made electric motors and produced the first electric starter for automobiles. The growth of the village as a prosperous farming and industrial community peaked between 1850 and 1870.

In 1835 Nathan Munro founded the Munro Academy, which eventually became [Munro Collegiate Institute] in 1854. Elbridge Elementary School now occupies the site which The Architectural Instructor Journal called &quot;an open landscape... surrounded by trees, which with the irregularity of the [Gothic-style] plan and outline of the structure itself, contribute to its picturesque effect.&quot; (1856). The Main Street of Elbridge (Route 5) is lined with beautiful 19th century homes, including at least one that is said to have been a station on the Underground Railroad and the Wayside Inn. The latter was featured some years ago on national television as one of America&#x27;s haunted places. According to some stories, a traveler died of a heart attack on the third floor and his spirit, dubbed &quot;George&quot;, still flirts with women and plays practical jokes.

== Village of Jordan ==
The Village of Jordan, the larger of the two villages, is located in the northwest section of the town. This settlement became a center of trade and manufacturing with the building of the Erie Canal, which passes directly through town. The remains of the Jordan aqueduct are now a park in downtown Jordan. Later, the main railroad line that traveled the length of New York State ran through Jordan. The fortunes of the village declined when the canal closed in 1912 and the railroads lost business to the trucking industry. Although the New York State thruway runs through the Town of Elbridge, and very close to Jordan itself, there was no exit built for the town. Still, a few industries remain including OWI Wire Mill, Bennet Bolt Works and Northeast Electronics.

== Tessy Plastics ==
Elbridge (specifically the Town of Elbridge) is the headquarters for Tessy Plastics, which manufactures injection molded plastic products. The company, which was founded in 1973 by Henry Beck, employs 1,000 people worldwide – 500 at the Elbridge plant alone. The privately owned and operated company provides fabricated parts and supplies to Xerox, Gillette, Duracell, BT Fuze, Abbott Point of Care, Scott Aviation, Johnson and Johnson companies, Lutron, and Welch Allyn. Although Tessy lost some income when its largest client, Xerox, stopped selling inkjet printers, it has continued to expand with its medical work. In 2003 it added a manufacturing addition to the main Elbridge plant and added another in 2004.

<text>Manlius is a village in Onondaga County, New York, United States, and a southeast suburb of Syracuse. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,662.

The Village of Manlius is located near the southern boundary of the Town of Manlius. An area of approximately three blocks within the village, running along Seneca Street and parallel to Pleasant Street, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Manlius Village Historic District.

==History==

Originally one of the communities in the Central New York Military Tract (defined as Township Number Seven), the town of Manlius was settled in 1794. The village, however, was settled two years before by John A. Shaeffer, a German. The first schoolhouse in Manlius was erected in 1798. Built out of logs, it was located near a local resident&#x27;s mill, named only as Mr. Costello. By 1801, the village began to grow, with six buildings and several amenities, including a blacksmith, store, doctor, lawyer, and a tavern. By the turn of the 19th century, there was also a post office defined as &quot;Liberty Square&quot;. However, the name of Liberty Square was eventually renamed Manlius Square. After four years, Manlius had grown at a rapid rate, with the building of thirty houses. The growing village was defined as one of the most prominent business locations in Onondaga County. The community became the first village in the county in 1813.

Before the construction of the Erie Canal, Manlius was a large business point along the Cherry Valley Turnpike and Seneca Turnpikes. Since the traveling of goods passed through Manlius on these turnpikes, every other structure along the highways were taverns. Between Manlius and nearby Chittenango, New York, there were only about six or seven public buildings. Most of this stretch of the Seneca Turnpike is now New York State Route 173.

For twenty years, Manlius was the largest trade center in Onondaga County, with what is now Syracuse, a swamp at the time. Into the early 20th century, its St. John Military Academy was a respected private school for young men.

The Manlius Village Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Manluis was a township of the former Central New York Military Tract. Manlius is the name of several important Romans, but exactly which one was being honored is no longer known. The current town was first settled around 1790.
The town of Manlius was founded in 1794, along with Onondaga country which decreased with the formation of new towns (DeWitt, Onondaga, Salina) and part of Syracuse.

<text>Marcellus is a village in the town of Marcellus in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,745. The village is southwest of Syracuse and is in the southern part of the town of Marcellus.

==History==
Settled in the late eighteenth century, the village was incorporated in 1853. Water power from Nine Mile Creek attracted mill development (wool, paper, and gunpowder) while the Seneca Turnpike (image above), passing through the village center, provided access.

The Dan Bradley House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

==Landmarks==
The Village of Marcellus retains some of the finest architectural and historic landmarks in Central New York, such as the Dan Bradley House (59 South Street), one of the oldest and least-altered houses of the region. Ambitious for its early date, it retains fine detail in the Federal style, including original windows with old glass. The Dan Bradley House was possibly built in the late eighteenth century. The Caleb Gasper House (formerly the Marcellus Free Library, 4 Slocombe Street), c. 1811, retains an entrance likewise in the Federal Style. Two important Greek Revival mansions are the Curtis Moses House (36 South Street), c. 1838, and the Dr. Lake I. Tefft House (18 North Street), c. 1830. The First Presbyterian Church of Marcellus (East Main and North Streets), 1851, is a Greek-Revival landmark. Although clad in modern vinyl siding, it is otherwise little altered. The Hiram Reed House (31 North Street), 1853, is an example of a residence in the new Italianate style of the mid-nineteenth century, surrounded by park-like grounds. The Edward Talbot House (Masonic Lodge, 46 East Main Street), c. 1835, is an earlier brick building altered in the Italianate style. Original entry porch columns were removed in more recent times, but otherwise the building is an example of mid-nineteenth-century architecture.

==Geography==
Marcellus is in a scenic region at (42.985572, -76.341378). Otisco Lake is to the south, Skaneateles Lake to the west, and Nine-Mile Creek, a trout stream, to the north. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.6 square mile (1.6 km2), all land.

<text>Skaneateles ( , ) is an affluent village in the town of Skaneateles, in Onondaga County, New York, United States. The village is named after, and located on the shores of, Skaneateles Lake, one of the Finger Lakes. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 2,533 residents.

==History==
Following the Revolutionary War, settlers rapidly populated the eastern Finger Lakes region in the 1790s. Water power from the outlet of Skaneateles Lake made the site of the present village attractive for settlement. Although it had been thought that the first permanent white settler in the area was John Thompson, further research has shown that Abraham A. Cuddeback from Minisink, New York was the first to arrive in 1794.
The old Genesee Road, which connected Utica, Marcellus, Auburn, Geneva and Avon became the Seneca Turnpike in 1800; the first bridge across Skaneateles Creek was built that year. The Seneca Turnpike, together with the Hamilton and Skaneateles Turnpike which opened in 1826, made the new community more accessible. Isaac Sherwood, founder of the Sherwood Inn, developed a stagecoach line through Skaneateles.

The village, which incorporated in 1833 and 1855, attracted prominent residents from an early date. In 1803, a major New York State landowner from New York City, William J. Vredenburgh, erected a sizable mansion. In 1839, Nicholas Roosevelt, &quot;one of the leading industrial entrepreneurs of the period [who] had built the big steam engines for the Philadelphia waterwork,&quot; also from New York City, retired to Skaneateles with his wife, Lydia Latrobe – daughter of the noted architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe.

In the same year, Richard DeZeng, an engineer and canal builder, retired from Oswego, New York to a mansion on the lake. Another Roosevelt family member, Samuel Montgomery Roosevelt, acquired DeZeng&#x27;s Greek Revival house which later became known as Roosevelt Hall. It may be the work of Ithiel Town, the partner of Alexander Jackson Davis, who designed the house of Reuel Smith, a wealthy Massachusetts importer who retired to Skaneateles. Built in 1852, the architecturally distinguished house, designed in the Gothic Revival style, has been listed in the National Registry; its plans are in the Library of Congress.

Many early residents such as James Canning Fuller came from Great Britain, largely because of the Quaker community here, giving the early village a cosmopolitan tone. Fuller and his wife Lydia maintained an active Underground Railroad station at their village home (built 1815, extant at 98 Genesee Street.) Fuller was co-founder of the British-American Institute, a Canadian school for fugitive slaves, together with the adjoining settlement of Dawn near Dresden, Ontario.

For more than two centuries, Skaneateles has also attracted visitors and tourists. An excursion boat launched in 1816 was probably the first instance of commercial tourist recreation in the Finger Lakes region.



==Geography==
The village is located at the north end of Skaneateles Lake at the eastern end of the Finger Lakes region. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The main highway through the community is U.S. Route 20 (Genesee Street), which heads westward toward Auburn. US 20 and Skaneateles also serve as the northern terminus of NY Route 41 and its suffixed route NY Route 41A. The village is also the southern terminus of NY Route 321.

==Demographics==
, there were 2,450 people, 1,094 households, and 674 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 1,190 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 97.84% White, 0.12% Black or African American, 0.82% Asian, 0.08% from other races, and 1.02% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.14% of the population.

There were 1,094 households, out of which 27.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.4% were married couples living together, 7.3% had an unmarried female householder, and 28.9% were non-families. 25.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 2.92.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 22.9% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 16.8% from 25 to 44, 35.6% from 45 to 64, and 19.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48.1 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.9 males.

The median household income in the village was $77,456, and the median family income was $117,788. In 2000, males had a median income of $64,524 versus $30,833 for females. The per capita income for the village was $49,957. About 3.31% of families and 6.20% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.6% of those under age 18 and 3.8% of those age 65 or over. In 2006, 164 residential properties in the Town of Skaneateles were assessed at more than a million dollars, compared to only two such properties in all the rest of Onondaga County.

==Government==
The Village of Skaneateles is governed by a five-person board consisting of the mayor and four trustees, each of whom is elected to a two-year term. On April 1, 2021, Mary Sennett succeeded Marty Hubbard as mayor, the first time a female has held this office in village history.

In the late 2000s, the village was involved in a controversy with the trucking industry which uses Route 20 through the village to reduce travel time and bypass tolls on the New York State Thruway. Most of the truck traffic hauls garbage from New York City to a landfill near Seneca Falls, New York. As of 2008, the state government was considering imposing restrictions on truck traffic. In November 2008, truckers staged a massive convoy through the Village during its popular holiday-time Dickens Festival.

The village lies within the town of Skaneateles, which has its own elected officials and staff. The Town and Village Joint Comprehensive Plan of 2005 examined consolidating the two entities into one government to reduce redundancies and create efficiencies. In 2009, the New York State Legislature passed legislation to ease such consolidations under the premise that they would create efficiencies and reduce tax burdens.

==Local attractions==

The village consists of a small commercial core with surrounding residential streets; the downtown area sits immediately on the lake. There are three publicly accessible parks on the lake within the downtown area. The main commercial streets in the village are Genesee Street (U.S. Route 20), Jordan Road, and Fennell Street. Genesee and Jordan streets, the core of the Skaneateles Historic District, are noted for their mix of mid-19th and early 20th century retail buildings which today contain a mix of retailers, including restaurants, boutiques, real estate offices, and banks. Fennell Street, which has a more industrial history and was the alignment for the railroad spur that served the village until the mid-20th century, contains more of the village&#x27;s car-oriented retail stores, including a supermarket, pharmacies, and post office.

Village attractions include boat excursions, inns, restaurants and a spa, as well as boutique shopping and art galleries. The summer Skaneateles Festival of music is a seasonal event, as is the annual Skaneateles Antique and Classic Boat Show and the Dickens Christmas in Skaneateles with actors in period costume performing on the streets. The Skaneateles Festival is where famous violinist Hilary Hahn played her first concerts as a young girl.

<text>Skaneateles ( , ) is a town in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 7,112. The name is from the Iroquois term for the adjacent &quot;Skaneateles&quot; Lake, which means &quot;long lake.&quot; The town is on the western border of the county and includes a village, also named Skaneateles. Both the town and village are southwest of Syracuse.

==History==

The area was part of the former Central New York Military Tract. On February 26, 1830, the town of Skaneateles was formed from the town of Marcellus, and the town later annexed areas of the Town of Spafford in 1840. Early turnpikes facilitated development. The town was noted for participation in reform movements before the Civil War.

In 1843, the Skaneateles Community acquired and successfully operated a large farm and developed small industries. It ultimately failed because of internal difficulties, as well as external concern about its unorthodox social practices. Locals sometimes referred to it as &quot;No God,&quot; because of the atheistic views of members. The Skaneateles Community published a newspaper, the &quot;Comunitist&quot; between 1844 and 1846 when the community dissolved. Buildings are extant, known as &quot;Community Place,&quot; now serving as a bed-and-breakfast.

Some Skaneateles men volunteered for the ill-fated Upper Canada Rebellion (1837) to liberate Canada and were imprisoned by the British in Australia. Quaker congregations were involved in abolitionist activity. Underground Railroad sites have been documented in Skaneateles. Although the larger city of Syracuse nearby was known nationally as a center of abolition and Underground Railroad activity, Skaneateles was said (by Beauchamp, an early historian) to have &quot;eclipsed Syracuse as an anti-slavery town.&quot;

On July 4, 1876, resident John Dodgson Barrow delivered the centennial address in Skaneateles recounting the history of the village up to that time. In 1891, he had it printed in Syracuse as a 20-page book.

The Brook Farm, Community Place, and Kelsey-Davey Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

===Overview===
Developed near Canandaigua Lake at the site of the historic Seneca village of &quot;Tganödä:gwëh,&quot; by the mid-19th century Canandaigua was an important railroad junction and home port for several steamboats that operated on the lake. After the Civil War, local industries included two brick works, the Lisk Manufacturing Company, several mills, and the regionally prominent McKechnie Brewery. The shire town of the original county of western New York, Canandaigua was the site of the trial of Susan B. Anthony in 1873 on charges of voting illegally because only men were allowed to vote.

In the 21st century, the town is a center for business, government, health care, and education. Canandaigua is the home of Constellation Brands, founded as Canandaigua Wine Company, which produces Manischewitz wine; Finger Lakes Community College; Thompson Health System; the Constellation Brands – Marvin Sands Performing Arts Center (CMAC); Granger Homestead; the &quot;Canandaigua Lady&quot; paddle-wheel tour boat; and Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park.

===Chronological===
French explorers Robert de La Salle and René de Bréhant de Galinée visited the region in 1669. They recorded seeing a burning spring known to the Seneca in what is now known as the nearby Town of Bristol. The water of the spring appears to burn as a flame; this is caused by escaping natural gas, and several such burning springs have been noted in the Canandaigua area.

The city was the historic site of &quot;Tganödä:gwëh,&quot; a Seneca village. The village site was later used for West Avenue Cemetery. The village was formed by former residents of the Ganondagan Seneca village, destroyed by the French in 1687.

The Tganödä:gwëh Seneca village, consisting of 23 longhouses, was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War by the Sullivan Expedition on September 10, 1779. American rebels had mounted this attack in reprisal for an attack by Mohawk and other British allies on Cherry Valley in the eastern part of the territory. The American forces attacked Iroquois villages throughout western New York, destroying 40 and burning the winter stores of the people. The Iroquois fled to Fort Niagara as refugees, and many died of starvation that winter.

After the war, pioneer settlers came from eastern New York and New England. They founded the city&#x27;s public high school, Canandaigua Academy, in 1791. On November 11, 1794, the Treaty of Canandaigua was signed in the town by representatives of the United States of America and the Six Nations of the Iroquois; the British had ceded Iroquois lands without consulting them, and the US forced most of the Iroquois Native Americans out of the state. It established two small reservations for the Seneca and Oneida, who had been allies of the American rebels, but they suffered considerable enmity and discrimination after the war.

What is now the city, separated from the Town of Canandaigua to become the Village of Canandaigua in 1815 and a city in 1913.

In 1807–1808, Jesse Hawley, a flour merchant from Geneva, served 20 months in the Canandaigua debtors&#x27; prison. He was an early proponent of building a canal through the Mohawk Valley to improve shipping and connect the Hudson River with Lake Erie. During his time in prison, he published 14 influential essays on the canal concept.

Stephen A. Douglas was a student at Canandaigua Academy between 1830 and January 1833; he later moved west and was elected as US senator from Illinois. He was the 1860 Democratic Party presidential nominee, losing to Republican Abraham Lincoln.

This area of New York was a center of activism for women&#x27;s suffrage and other progressive movements. In 1873, the Ontario County Courthouse, located in the City of Canandaigua, was the site of the trial of Susan B. Anthony, a leader of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, who was arrested for voting at a time when only men were allowed to vote. She was found guilty and fined $100, which she did not pay.

John Willys, born in Canandaigua in 1873, operated a bicycle sales and repair shop there, before later becoming a successful automobile manufacturer.

On October 30, 1900, Theodore Roosevelt made a brief stop in Canandaigua to give a campaign speech at Atwater Park.

In 1945, Marvin Sands founded Canandaigua Wine Company. With a growing American market for wine in the late 20th century, the company expanded rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s. It joined other companies in forming Constellation Brands, and became the world&#x27;s largest wine and spirits distributor. In 2006, Canandaigua Wine Company rebranded as Centerra Wine Co., a subsidiary of Constellation Wines, U.S., Inc.

On March 14, 2006, President George W. Bush visited Canandaigua, giving speeches at Canandaigua Academy and Ferris Hills, an independent residential living community for seniors. He was describing Medicare Part D for senior citizens. The text of his speech at Ferris Hills can be found here.

<doc id="259942" wikidata="Q5532974" url="?curid=259942" title="Geneva (town), New York">
<text>Geneva is a town in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 3,478 at the 2020 census. The actual source of the name is ambiguous.

The Town of Geneva is in the southeastern part of the county and borders the City of Geneva.

Geneva is known for being the home of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station run by Cornell University.

== History ==
The town is situated in the territory of the historic Seneca, who had an important village at Kanadaseaga (&quot;Seneca Castle&quot;), at the north end of Seneca Lake. This village was fortified during the Colonial Period as a defense against the French and was later used as a British stronghold during the American Revolution. It was destroyed by the Sullivan Expedition.

Post-revolution settlement began around 1788. The town was established from part of the Town of Seneca in 1872.

Seth Reed and his family settled here and owned an 18-mile tract of land in Ontario County between 1787 and 1795 before becoming the earliest settlers of Erie, Pennsylvania. Colonel Reed had been involved in the Battle of Bunker Hill and the Canada campaign while serving in the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. His latter experiences in this region of New York may have attracted him to Ontario County and Geneva.

In 1806, the village called Geneva began to set itself apart from the town and was incorporated as a village in 1812. A new charter making Geneva a first class village was granted in 1871.

The loss of this territory to the City of Geneva made the town the smallest in the county.

== Geography ==

<text>Naples is a town in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 2,417 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Naples contains a village, also called Naples. The town is located in the southwestern corner of Ontario County. It is located in the Finger Lakes region of New York.

The annual Naples Grape Festival is held in September, and the area is known for its wineries and grape pie.

== History and other information ==
Naples was part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase.

The town was established in 1789 along with Ontario County, on the old Native American village Nundawao, and settlement began the following year. The town was also part of the Underground Railroad, with old houses still having hiding spots to this day. The town, known in 1789 as &quot;Watkinstown&quot; (after Captains Nathan and William Watkins, Revolutionary War veterans and early settlers) and in 1796, they called the town &quot;Middletown&quot;. And then, finally, the town was given the name &quot;Naples&quot; in 1808. Naples was not quickly settled due to its rough terrain. Part of the new town was used to form the Town of Italy in 1815, and another part was used to form part of the Town of Springwater in 1816.

Grapes, first planted in the 1860s, led to the modern grape and wine industry of the town and also led to the annual grape festival which began in 1961, one of which was broadcast on the World Food Network.

The village is home to St. Januarius Catholic Church, a unique architectural design by James Johnson. With the local grape industry as inspiration, much of the church was designed with grapes in mind.

The Widmer&#x27;s Winery produces Manischewitz wine.

Naples Academy was founded in 1860. The main building of the current Academy was built during the New Deal program during the Great Depression by one of the public works programs set out by FDR. The school district currently serves grades Pre-K through 12, with grades Pre-K through 6 being in the Elementary School and grades 7 through 12 in the Jr/Sr High School across the street.

<text>Chester is a town in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 12,646 at the 2020 census. Chester contains a village, also called Chester.

Chester is the birthplace of Philadelphia-style cream cheese.

== History ==
The Lenape people have settled in Orange County for over 5,000 years. Europeans first settled in the 1700s which were ethnic Dutch and English colonists. 
The economy of the early town was based on dairy products, particularly milk. This industry flourished because completion of the Erie Railroad in 1841, which ran through Chester, enabled local farmers to ship their products to New York City, where demand was high. For instance, local farmer Phil Gregory would ship 240 quarts () of milk by train to New York City. The railroad earned $1.20 ($ in modern dollars) in freight charges; Gregory&#x27;s business eventually grew to 300,000 quarts () of milk per day, which in turn gave the railroad over $1,000 ($ in modern dollars) in daily profit.

===Late 20th century to present===
In 2018, the Town of Chester approved a large residential development. It learned that the development appeared to be targeted toward the Satmar Hasidic community, whose rapid growth in this area had caused tensions. The large families of the Orthodox created strains for the local public school system, and there were other tensions between the strict Kiryas Joel and neighboring communities. Town supervisor Alex Jamieson told a local newspaper that the town would be buying up areas of undeveloped open space, including around the planned development in Chester, in order &quot;to keep the Hasidic out so that they can&#x27;t control the Town Board.&quot; His comments were widely reported and criticized by &quot;The Forward&quot; as antisemitic.

==Geography==

<text>Goshen is a village in and the county seat of Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 5,777 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Kiryas Joel-Poughkeepsie-Newburgh metropolitan area as well as the larger New York metropolitan area.

The village is within the town of Goshen, some fifty miles northwest of New York City, on New York State Route 17 in the center of Orange County. Goshen is the home of the Harness Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame, and hosted harness racing&#x27;s top event, the Hambletonian, from 1930 to 1956, at the former Good Time Park. Racing is still held at the Historic Track, a National Historic Landmark in the center of the village.

== History ==
The village was settled in 1714 and incorporated on March 28, 1809. In 1727 it was declared the &quot;half-shire town&quot; of Orange County, a predecessor to its current status as county seat. It did not take on that full status, however, until Rockland County was split from the county in 1798, and Goshen was designated the seat since Orangetown was in the new county. For a while afterward it shared that status with Newburgh, moved into Orange as compensation for the lost territory, but since the late 19th century all county government functions have been centralized in Goshen.

Goshen was the site of the hanging of the famous outlaw Claudius Smith, a British Loyalist who— along with the Mohawk Indian Chief Joseph Brant— raided the countryside surrounding Goshen during the American Revolutionary War. He and Brandt are said to have buried their many stolen treasures in the hills surrounding Goshen, and that Claudius is himself buried somewhere on the grounds of the old Presbyterian Church – with his skull having been embedded in the wall. Smith was hanged on January 22, 1779, and exactly six months later, on July 22, 1779, Brant raided what is now Port Jervis. A militia from Goshen set out to stop Brant, engaging in the disastrous Battle of Minisink, in which 45 local militiamen were killed. A monument in the center of town marks the spot where their bones were buried in a mass grave 43 years after the battle.

As early as the 1750s, residents used to race their horses along what is now Main Street in the village&#x27;s downtown. In 1838, a circular track was built around a nearby circus ground. This was the first incarnation of the Historic Track, where races are still held for one week each year, making it the oldest horse racing facility still in use in the United States. Later, the larger Good Time Park was built, which hosted the Hambletonian in later years. The Harness Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame near the track recognizes Goshen&#x27;s historic importance to the sport.

In the early 20th century, the village was the home of the Interpines sanitarium, as well as the Coates-Goshen automobile, which was built and produced for two years from 1908 to 1910. In 1950, Goshen had a population of 3,311 people. By 1990, the village had been largely built out, and the number of people stood at 5,255; despite a building boom in the town, the village has remained about the same size.

In 1992, the tiny, provincial village was rocked by the same criminal, Catholic priesthood pedophilia that was gradually being exposed nation and worldwide. Fr. Edward Pipala (then age 53) the pastor of St. John the Evangelist, R. Catholic Church on Murray Ave, had been molesting troubled, young teens in a number of parishes, including Sacred Heart in Monroe, NY, Staten Island and Croton Falls, NY for decades.

==Government==

The village has a mayor-council government that follows the same form as all other villages with that government in New York: a five-member village board consisting of a mayor and four trustees, all with equal voting power. The mayor is the village&#x27;s chief executive and carries out all day-to-day management functions. The mayor is Scott Wohl and the four trustees are Tony Scotto, Chris Gurda, Molly O&#x27;Donnell and Daniel Henderson.

The Orange County Government Center is located in Goshen; a brutalist work by Paul Rudolph.

==Infrastructure==
Fire protection is provided to the village by the Goshen Fire Department, an all-volunteer organization comprising three fire companies (Dikeman Engine and Hose, Cataract Engine and Hose and Minisink Hook and Ladder). Each of the companies are housed in separate modern fire stations located in the district.

<text>Goshen is a town in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 14,571 at the 2020 census. The town is named after the Biblical Land of Goshen. It contains a village also called Goshen, which is the county seat of Orange County. The town is centrally located in the county.

== History ==
European settlement began around 1714, although plans for this were made beginning about 1654. The town was established in 1788, after the American Revolutionary War and New York becoming a state. As population increased in the area, in 1830, part of Goshen was divided off to form the new Town of Hamptonburgh. In 1845, another part was used to form the Town of Chester.

When the French and Indian War began in 1756, the men of Goshen took up arms. The old &quot;Journal of the Assembly&quot; relates the services of Captain George DeKay as an express between Goshen and Minisink. It mentions as his guards Peter Carter, David Benjamin, Philip Reid, and Francis Armstrong. It tells also that Colonel Vincent Mathews was paid two pounds to furnish guides to regulars posted at Goshen from October 1757, to February 1758. Colonels Clinton and DeKay fortified block houses for the settlers&#x27; defense. Samuel Gale was paid 56 pounds to furnish provisions to troops on the frontiers near Goshen. Colonel Benj. Tusten, Captain Daniel Case, and Captain J. Bull were reimbursed for their expenses in building block houses Nos. 1 and 2 on the western frontier in January 1757.

In 1763, Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Golden appealed to the General Assembly for troops to relieve the militia on the borders of Orange and Ulster counties, an area infiltrated by the enemy. At this time the Town of Goshen extended from the Hudson River to the New Jersey border. In 1764 a bill was passed dividing the precinct of Goshen into two precincts, to be called Goshen and Cornwall. After this division, Cornwall embraced the present towns of Cornwall, Monroe and Blooming Grove, while Goshen included the present town of Warwick.

Revolutionary fervor built in the years before war broke out in the late eighteenth century. On June 8, 1775, over 360 men signed the Revolutionary pledge at Goshen, headed by Henry Wisner at the top of the list. Once General George Washington, riding eastward on the Florida road toward his headquarters at Newburgh, stopped with his staff to chat with local children at the old school house near the stone quarry.

The battle of Minisink took place on July 22, 1779. The Goshen regiment, under Colonel Tusten, was nearly destroyed by an estimated 500 Indians and Tories commanded by Joseph Brant (Mohawk), also known as &quot;Thayendanegea&quot;, the Scourge. He held a colonel&#x27;s commission from George III. The Goshen regiment marched against Brant&#x27;s forces to avenge a raid made by Brant upon the settlers near Minisink on July 20. They were joined by a small reinforcement, under Colonel Hathorn, of the Warwick regiment, and the latter assumed command. While marching along the west bank of the Delaware River, they discovered the Indians about three quarters of a mile away, and Colonel Hathorn chased them. Brant took advantage of the woods and moved to the rear of the attacking party. His forces completely routed the small colonial force that opposed them. The colonists had little ammunition and some fled; more men were killed in that stage than in battle. Colonel Tusten, a surgeon, dressed his men&#x27;s wounds and stayed on the field until he became a casualty. Of the 80 Goshen men in the engagement, 44 were killed outright and numerous others died later of their wounds.

Colonel Benjamin Tusten, who was a physician and surgeon by profession, came originally from Southold, L. I., in 1746, at the age of three years. His parents located on the banks of the Otterkill on the patent granted to Elizabeth Denn. His father, Benjamin Tusten, was appointed one of the judges of the courts of the county and also a colonel in the Orange County regiment of militia. The son, Benjamin, was sent to an academy at Jamaica, Long Island. At age nineteen, he returned to Goshen to study medicine with Doctor Thomas Wiskham. He later studied further in Newark, New Jersey, and New York City., returning in 1769 to practice medicine in Goshen, where two other physicians, Doctor John Gale and Doctor Pierson, had already located. He was very successful and was widely known as a surgeon. He married Miss Brown, by whom he had two sons and three daughters. In 1777 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the Goshen regiment of militia under General Allison, and in 1778 was appointed surrogate of Orange County, which office he held when he lost his life at Minisink.

Captain John Wood, of Colonel Tusten&#x27;s regiment, was captured in the battle of Minisink. Brant spared his life, reportedly because he saw Wood give a Masonic sign and was himself a Mason. Wood was taken captive and transported to a Mohawk village in Upper Canada. He left a journal of events that discussed the life and character of Brant.

Noah Webster, most notable for his work on An American Dictionary of the English Language, which later became part of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, established and taught at school in Goshen called The Farmers&#x27; Hall Academy from 1782-1783. This academy is also noted for having been attended by former secretary of state William H. Seward. The original two-room brick structure of the academy now sits within the Goshen Town Hall, as described by the Historical Marker located outside the building in the center of the Village of Goshen.

===19th century===
On July 22, 1822, the village of Goshen erected a monument to the dead of the Minisink battle. The remains of those men were gathered from the battlefield for burial in a mass grave marked by the monument. On July 22, 1862, a more elaborate monument was dedicated to these men. The funds were bequeathed in the will of Dr. Merritt H. Cash, of Minisink.

The current county courthouse in Goshen was constructed in 1841 and reflects the Greek Revival style in architecture. This is prevalent among buildings of a similar age in the Town and was popular for many county courthouses.

Goshen&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church was constructed in 1720. In the colonial era, public hangings were conducted at the tree located just outside the church The church&#x27;s steeple, more than 8 stories tall, towers over the historic center of the town. As late as 1890, the church continued to be the tallest structure in the county, visible from miles away. The church connects to a series of tunnels under the town. No one knows their original purpose. (A drone video of the church can be seen here: The First Presbyterian Church.)

Horse racing was popular in Goshen and other towns. Competitors raced horses on the roads from 1783, at the end of the Revolution. What is now known as Goshen Historic Track opened in 1838 and is the oldest half-mile track in the world. It was originally opened as a 1/3rd-mile circle around a circus ground, which was then succeeded by multiple iterations including a square track until the current half-mile oval was constructed in 1873. It is also &quot;the oldest continuously operated horse racing track in the country&quot; and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. This region was important in the development of harness racing, and owners bred horses to excel in this sport. On June 24, 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant visited the town, staying in a local house and watching racing from a barn on the property.

After the Civil War began, Goshen was the site for Camp Wickham, which held volunteers raised in Goshen in the summer of 1862. The 124th Regiment of Volunteers was mustered into federal service in Goshen on September 5, 1862, serving nearly three years. They mustered out at Washington&#x27;s Headquarters in Newburgh, New York on June 14, 1865. The soldiers of this regiment fought in the Appomattox Campaign, and were present at the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Courthouse.

===20th century to present===
In 2007, Michael Kohn, an 18-year-old Goshen Volunteer firefighter, started a fire that destroyed a house at 113 Webster Ave. Kohn pleaded guilty to arson, admitting also to starting fires in another house, a barn and a vehicle within a short period. He said that he had been struggling with depression. He was sentenced to five to fifteen years in prison.

In 2014, Devin Giordano and Jennifer Molyneaux murdered 81-year-old Helen Mills in her Goshen home, after breaking in to steal money for drugs. The pair pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2015, and Giordano pleaded guilty to other counts, including arson and robbery. Giordano was sentenced to 20 years to life for the murder.

===Legoland===
On May 29, 2021, Lego opened a Legoland theme park in Goshen, which is 60 miles north of New York City. The park opened on May 29, 2021, with protocols for protection from the COVID-19 pandemic and cost over $500 million to build. Built by Merlin Entertainment, the park contains a 250 room lego hotel, rides, and is spread across 500 acres of land. It was the first major theme park to open in the Northeast in 40 years. The park is estimated to have 10,000 visitors a day and contain more than 15,000 lego models.

====Controversy====
From the moment Goshen was identified as a home for the park, the company was met with pushback from local community members and faced constant controversy. Beginning in 2017, locals identified as &quot;Concerned Citizens for the Hudson Valley&quot; met at the Legoland welcome center to protest the park&#x27;s construction, complaining about the lack of transparency and the presence of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; meetings. In November 2017, residents filed a suit in the Orange County Supreme Court to block the construction of the park. They argued that the Goshen town board fast-tracked the approval and construction of the park understanding that many Goshen residents would disapprove of the park&#x27;s construction.

In October 2021, the New York Times published an article highlighting the controversy around the park and the many complaints of town locals. The article described how state inspectors cited Legoland for 67 environmental violations which resulted in fines totaling more than $600,000. The article also highlighted the many political battles that took place during town halls and outside many of the town&#x27;s popular establishment. Many residents argued that they moved to Goshen for the local nature and the quiet atmosphere. However, during the early months of construction, many residents filed complaints of noise and topsoil runoff. Officials noted that the park would pay $88 million over 20 years, a fee for every ticket sold, taxes on its sales and revenue, and about $61 million towards Goshen schools for two decades.

<text>Montgomery is a village located in Orange County, New York, United States. Located northwest of New York City, and southwest of Albany, this quaint community is an historical and cultural hub of the Hudson Valley region and has grown in the last 30 years to become an outer-ring commuter suburb within the New York metropolitan area. The population was 3,834 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. The village is named after General Richard Montgomery, an officer of the American Revolution.

The Village of Montgomery is inside the Town of Montgomery.

== History ==

The original name for the village was Ward&#x27;s Bridge, from James Ward, one of the first settlers, who built and operated a grist mill in what is now the village during the mid-18th century. A bridge over the Wallkill River near the mill was named after him, and even today the name and the bridge, which carries Route NY-17K into the village, remain in use.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.8 km2), of which 1.4 square miles (3.6 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km2) (4.14%) is water.

Most of that water area is accounted for by the portions of the Wallkill which forms Montgomery&#x27;s northern boundary; there are no other significant bodies of water in the village. The village is completely surrounded by the Town of Montgomery.

From the river the village extends to the southwest almost two miles (3.2 km), generally longer than it is wide, with a projecting area to the southeast along Goodwill Road. The village&#x27;s downtown is centered on its historical core, the area covered by the Bridge Street and Union Street-Academy Hill historic districts, just south of Ward Street (NY-17K). Clinton Street, one block south of Ward, is lined with shops and restaurants. Further to the east, some larger businesses are located near the former Wallkill Valley Railroad (WVRR) tracks, still used by Norfolk Southern as a freight spur.

Away from downtown, the streets become primarily residential, with newer housing. There are some undeveloped areas at the northern and southern extremes of the village, the latter taking the form of actively farmed fields. To the west-southwest of downtown, closer to the river, is Montgomery&#x27;s major park, Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Park.

These lands in the west are the lowest-lying in the village. Much of its topography rises gently from the river, with little relief save the Academy Hill area on the east edge of downtown where the village hall is located, and a hill at the junction of Purple Martin Road and Cardinal Drive that is the highest point in the village, marked by a water tower.

===Transportation===

Route 17K leads east to Newburgh and west to Bloomingburg, where it ends at NY 17, the future I-86. Its major intersection in the village, Montgomery&#x27;s only traffic light, is the three-way intersection with Union Street, the northern terminus of NY-211, which connects it to Middletown to the southwest. Just south of the village, NY-416 branches off from 211, providing access to Goshen via NY-207 at its southern terminus. 

Interstate 84 passes close to the southeast. The nearest access to the village is Exit 5, reached by taking Route 17K or Goodwill Road east to NY 208. From here it is a six-mile drive to the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87), the nearest major north–south road. New York City is another 58 miles south from Newburgh on the Thruway.

The nearest passenger rail connection is the Campbell Hall station on Metro-North&#x27;s Port Jervis Line, located on Watkins Road near State Route 207, approximately 7 miles southwest of Montgomery. It provides commuter rail service to the Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey. Many commuters also use Metro-North&#x27;s Beacon station, 17 miles east of Montgomery, to travel to Midtown Manhattan. Some officials in Walden, where the freight spur ends, have been lobbying Metro-North to restore passenger service along the old WVRR freight spur, which also raises the possibility of a station in Montgomery.

Orange County Airport, KMGJ, is located just south of the village. Commercial passenger service is available at Stewart International Airport outside Newburgh, a short distance east via I-84.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 3,636 people, 1,304 households, and 971 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 1,338 housing units at an average density of .

==General Montgomery Day==

Since 1989 the village has held its annual General Montgomery Day event on the Saturday following Labor Day. The festivities begin with a parade along Union Street to village hall on Clinton Street; there is also an run. Streets are closed off downtown and vendors and various local organizations set up tents. Visitors come from all around the Hudson Valley; there have been as many as 30,000 some years. The village used to suspend its open-container law for the day until some incidents arising from the heavy drinking made them reconsider. It concludes with fireworks in the evening at the Pleasure Ground park.

==Fire protection==
Montgomery is protected by an all volunteer Fire Department which has been active and dedicated to the community since 1810. The Montgomery Fire Department, which is the oldest volunteer fire department in Orange County, was organized on March 6, 1810, with the appointment of the first three village fire wardens. The Fire Department protects the residents of the Village of Montgomery as well as portions of the Town of Montgomery, totaling almost 8,000 citizens. The response district covers three large schools (Valley Central Middle and High Schools, Montgomery Elementary, and multiple smaller specialized schools), the Wallkill River, numerous lakes and ponds, and the Orange County Airport. The Montgomery Fire Department operates out of 1 Fire Station Located at 136 Ward Street and responds to vehicle accidents, ALS medical calls, fires, hazardous material incidents, and rescue incidents. The Montgomery Fire Department runs 2 Engines, 1 Ladder, 1 Heavy Rescue, 1 ALS Fly Car, 1 Brush Unit, 1 Rescue Boat and Ice Rescue Trailer, and 1 Fire Police Vehicle.

==Education==
It is in the Valley Central School District (Montgomery).

<text>Montgomery is a town in Orange County, New York, United States. Located roughly northwest of New York City, the town of Montgomery is an historical and cultural hub of the Hudson Valley region and has been a steadily growing outer-ring commuter suburb, in the last 30 years, within the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population was listed as 23,322.

The town was named in the honor of Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 at the Battle of Quebec. The northern town line is contiguous with the Ulster County border. Montgomery is immediately west of the town of Newburgh. Within its borders are three villages, one eponymous, as well as Walden and most of Maybrook.

==History==

The early town began as a patent to Henry Wileman in 1710, who was the first settler. He was the first of a group of Palatine Germans to emigrate and settle land around what is now the village of Montgomery.

The town was originally established as Hanover in 1772, but became the town of Montgomery in 1782.

The community of Montgomery was set off by incorporation as a village in 1810, and in 1855, the community of Walden was incorporated as well. Maybrook was the last village to be incorporated, in 1926.

==Geography==
Montgomery is bordered on the east by the town of Newburgh and on the north by the town of Shawangunk in Ulster County. The town of Crawford is to the west. The towns of Wallkill, Hamptonburgh and New Windsor, from west to east, border on the south.

The village of Walden is located in the north central portion of town. Montgomery is close to the center, and Maybrook is in the southeast corner. There are few significant year-round settlements outside of the villages; there is a summer colony around Lake Osiris in the northern section of town. Some inhabitants of Lake Osiris have made it their permanent residence. Fox Hill Bruderhof is located on the southern edge of Walden and has about 250 residents who work in their furniture factory and the Plough Publishing House.

The town&#x27;s topography is generally level and low, except along parts of its eastern and western boundaries, reflecting the passage of the Wallkill River through it from north to west. There are large swamps in the south portion of town, some of them draining into the Otter Kill. Further north, the land becomes drier and more arable. It is mostly farmed, used for small residential subdivisions or left as undeveloped open space. There are a few exceptions: the business parks along Bracken, Neelytown and Stone Castle roads and NY 208, several of the Valley Central schools, the large Shop Rite plaza on Goodwill Road and Orange County Airport.

Two areas along the river have been set aside as parks. The county&#x27;s Winding Hills Park is partially within Montgomery, as are portions of two larger state-level protected areas: Highland Lakes State Park and Stewart State Forest. The Thomas Bull Memorial Park, which expands over 719 acres and is the second largest developed park in Orange County, is named after a sympathizer to the British during the American Revolution.

The Wallkill River is the town&#x27;s major watercourse, flowing through it from south to north past both the villages Montgomery and Walden, also partially serving as its border with Hamptonburgh. Two of its tributaries flow through Montgomery as well. The Muddy Kill, located entirely within the town, drains the area below the Comfort Hills in west central Montgomery. Tin Brook, the Wallkill&#x27;s only major eastern tributary, rises just southeast of the town and flows north, then west, through Walden to drain into the river just north of the village.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 51.1 square miles (132.3 km2), of which, 50.4 square miles (130.6 km2) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.7 km2) of it (1.25%) is water. The highest point in the town is the U.S. Geological Survey&#x27;s Garrison benchmark at a corner of the Ulster County line on Kings Hill, at above sea level; this is also the highest point in the neighboring Town of Newburgh as well. The lowest elevation is , where the Wallkill River flows across the northern town and county line.

==Transportation==

Montgomery is referred to as the &quot;transportation hub of the northeast&quot; from the days prior to the 1940s. The Erie Railroad (later part of Erie Lackawanna) had the Goshen-Montgomery branch that went from Montgomery southward to Campbell Hall, Campbell Hall Junction, to the Erie Railroad&#x27;s main line at Goshen. The Wallkill Valley Railroad (later absorbed into the New York Central) ran north from Montgomery, to New Paltz, to Kingston, connecting there to the New York Central&#x27;s West Shore Railroad. Both railroads discontinued passenger operations on those lines by 1938. As of the late 20th century the rail lines have been reduced to freight spurs and rail trails, and roads have taken over that role.

Orange County Airport, a small airport located in Montgomery, opened in 1943.

<text>New Windsor is a town in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 27,805 at the 2020 census. It is located on the eastern side of the county and is adjacent to the Hudson River and the City of Newburgh.

== History ==
The region was originally inhabited by the Munsee people, part of the Lenape confederation. The first European settlers were colonists from Scotland who arrived in 1685. New Windsor was founded by the General Assembly of New York on April 5, 1763.

===European Settlements===
Settlement rights in the area that now encompasses the town were obtained from the Munsee by Governor Thomas Dongan, who encouraged the settlement of a party of Scottish colonists led by David Toshack, the Laird of Monzievaird, and his brother-in-law Major Patrick McGregorie. They arrived in 1685 and settled in the area overlooking the Hudson River near Moodna Creek. McGregorie is said to have built a cabin north of the creek on Conwanham&#x27;s Hill at Plum Point, while Toshack set up a trading post south of the creek on Sloop Hill. In June 1685, Governor Dongan appointed McGregorie Muster-Master of Militia for the City and Province of New York.

A rival claim was obtained in 1694 by Captain John Evans of HMS &quot;Richmond&quot;, who was granted powers and privileges as lord of the manor. The next governor, the Earl of Bellomont, decided that this was unfair to the settlers, and had the Evans grant annulled in 1699. An additional patent of 1,000 acres was issued in 1709 to William Chambers and William Southerland. Around 1709, the portion of the town nearest the Hudson River was organized under the Precinct of the Highlands (Ulster County), remaining thus until 1743. In 1762, separate precincts were created for the Town of New Windsor and Newburgh.

The name of the town is from Windsor, England, with the &quot;New&quot; being prefixed. By whom this was conferred cannot be ascertained, but first appears in 1728 records of the London &quot;Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts&quot;. Among the earliest roads was the King&#x27;s Highway, later known as &quot;the Goshen Road&quot;, which ran north and south. Among the early residents of the town was William Ellison, who, as early as 1732 kept a store and owned sloops that sailed from New Windsor to New York. Captains James and William Jackson also owned their own sloops.

===American Revolutionary War===
During much of the Revolutionary War, New Windsor served as the major depot for the Continental Army and Army Medical Dept. The majority of town residents supported the war efforts and its leaders.

In October 1782, the troops began to arrive and set up tents, while they began building their huts. This encampment or cantonment covered 1600 acres (6.5 km2) and quartered 6000–8000 men, women and children from New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maryland. Here this army built a log city of over 700 huts for the soldiers and many other outbuildings, guardhouses, blacksmith shops, a stable, kitchens, and a hospital. In addition, a long building called the &quot;Temple&quot; was constructed. It was proposed by Rev. Israel Evans, Chaplain to the Army, that a structure be built for religious services. The building also served a general meeting hall. Upon its completion, the officers held a ball.

In order to reward the fidelity and faithfulness of soldiers, Gen. Washington ordered the establishment of an honor, the Badge of Military Merit, to be bestowed on them. Today, this honor is known as the Purple Heart. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located New Windsor.

In an effort to preserve this encampment, the town of New Windsor acquired a tract consisting of much of the former hut sites. Since 1936, the town of New Windsor and the membership of the National Temple Hill Association have striven to ensure the preservation of this, the final winter encampment.

===Post-Revolution===
The Little Britain Presbyterian Church was organized by Irish and Scottish immigrants. The first church building was constructed in 1765 and used by the Continentals as a hospital. This was subsequently destroyed by fire and a new structure was erected in 1807.

In 1814, the town was divided into nine school districts. The first school was a one-room schoolhouse built on Quassaick Avenue in 1841. Epiphany Apostolic College was founded in 1925. The site is now owned by the Newburgh Enlarged City School District.

&quot;Circa&quot; 1858 to 1859, the Palmer and Longking company operated on the Quassaick Creek the first large scale factory for the manufacture of &quot;bellows-box&quot; daguerreotype cameras. The factory, on the site of Sterrit&#x27;s former pin factory, had approximately thirty-five employees. The building was later converted to a flour mill and subsequently burned down.

==Historical sites==

*Knox&#x27;s Headquarters: In 1724 Thomas Ellison purchased the Vincent Matthews property at Vails Gate. In 1754 Thomas Ellison Jr. had noted stonemason William Bull of Hamptonburgh build a stone mansion and mill off Forge Hill Road. The property later passed to his son, John Ellison. Grain from as far west as Montgomery was ground and sold at this mill. The house later served during the Revolutionary War as a Continental Army&#x27;s headquarters for generals Nathanael Greene, Horatio Gates and subsequently by Henry Knox.
*New Windsor Cantonment State Historic Site: A patent was granted to Colonel John Haskell in 1719 of 2,000 acres and another 2,000 acres in 1721 upon which he settled in 1726. He erected a log manor on what was known as the Dusenberry farm, upon which the army erected the Temple when encamped there. In addition to the Last Encampment of the Continental Army hut sites owned by the town of New Windsor, the temple site is operated by the state of New York, known as the New Windsor Cantonment. Located there is the Mountainville Hut, believed to be a survivor from the encampment.

* Squire Patton House: A farmhouse owned by the Patton family built in the 1790s with subsequent exterior additions and interior embellishments. A synthesis of English and Dutch vernacular styles prevalent among colonial houses in the Hudson Valley.
*Edmonston House: James Edmonston came from County Tipperary, Ireland in 1720. For time his log cabin was the only house between New Windsor and what would become Washingtonville. A stone house located on Route 94 was built by James&#x27; son William in 1755 to replace the log cabin.
* The Thomas McDowell House, located on Lake Road in the Little Britain section of the town was built around 1770 by McDowell, an early settler of the area. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.
* The Brewster House: Samuel Brewster and his brother Henry came to New Windsor about 1743 and had been among the first proprietors of the township in 1749. The Brewster House was built in 1762 as a simple fieldstone house. Brewster was a member of the Committee of Safety during the American Revolution. He is mainly remembered in local history as the owner of a saw-mill, forge and anchor shop and assisted in forging the chain which was stretched across the Hudson River in the hope of checking the movement of British vessels up that stream. The building now houses Schlesinger&#x27;s Steak House.

==Churches==
* The Vails Gate United Methodist Church (originally the New Windsor Methodist Church) was founded in 1789. The congregation met in John Ellison&#x27;s store until 1807 when a church was built on land donated by Ellison. It was the first Methodist Church built in Orange County.
* St. Thomas Episcopal Church is located on River Road in New Windsor, New York, a short distance off US 9W. It was established in 1818 on land bequeathed by Thomas Ellison. It is a small stone building listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.
* St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church began as a mission church on Coffey Avenue in 1880. In August 2015 St. Joseph&#x27;s parish merged with the parish of St. Thomas of Canterbury in Cornwall-on-Hudson.
* Ridgecrest Baptist Church on Blooming Grove Turnpike was begun in 1962.

==Transportation==

Little Britain Road is one of the oldest in the town.

Stewart International Airport is located partially in New Windsor and partially in the town of Newburgh. Formerly Stewart Air Force Base, the airport is named after Capt. Lachlan Stewart, who skippered schooners and other sailing vessels about 1850–1870. Stewart was also a lumber merchant and later retired to a dairy farm. In 1930, his grandson, Thomas Archibald (&quot;Archie&quot;) Stewart, persuaded his uncle, Samuel L. Stewart, to donate land at &quot;Stoney Lonesome&quot;, to the city of Newburgh for an airport.

Stewart continued as part of the Strategic Air Command until the late 1960s or early 1970s when the Air Force turned the base over to the MTA for use as a cargo facility. The grand plan to create a jetport lead to the acquisition of over 8000 acres (32 km2) of the present day buffer zone and the loss of many early farms and structures. During the late 1980s, through the efforts of the late State Senator Schermerhorn, the airport passed into the hands of the NY State Dept. of Transportation. Today, Stewart International in addition to its civilian capability, is the home base of the NY Air National Guard and United States Marine Corps Reserve MAG-49 Detachment Bravo.

There is a new entrance to Stewart International Airport, via New York State Route 747. Now for the first time, the airport can be accessed directly from the Interstates without encountering local traffic on the state roads.

<text>Avoirdupois (; abbreviated avdp.) is a measurement system of weights that uses pounds and ounces as units. It was first commonly used in the 13th century AD and was updated in 1959.

In 1959, by international agreement, the definitions of the pound and ounce became standardized in countries which use the pound as a unit of mass. The &quot;International Avoirdupois Pound&quot; was then created. It is the everyday system of weights used in the United States. It is still used, in varying degrees, in everyday life in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and some other former British colonies, despite their official adoption of the metric system.
The avoirdupois weight system&#x27;s general attributes were originally developed for the international wool trade in the Late Middle Ages, when trade was in recovery. It was historically based on a physical standardized pound or &quot;prototype weight&quot; that could be divided into 16 ounces. There were a number of competing measures of mass, and the fact that the avoirdupois pound had three even numbers as divisors (half and half and half again) may have been a cause of much of its popularity, so that the system won out over systems with 12 or 10 or 15 subdivisions. The use of this unofficial system gradually stabilized and evolved, with only slight changes in the reference standard or in the prototype&#x27;s actual mass.Over time, the desire not to use too many different systems of measurement allowed the establishment of &quot;value relationships&quot;, with other commodities metered and sold by weight measurements such as bulk goods (grains, ores, flax) and smelted metals; so the avoirdupois system gradually became an accepted standard through much of Europe.

In England, Henry VII authorized its use as a standard, and Queen Elizabeth I acted three times to enforce a common standard, thus establishing what became the Imperial system of weights and measures. Late in the 19th century various governments acted to redefine their base standards on a scientific basis and establish ratios between local avoirdupois measurements and international SI metric system standards. The legal actions of these various governments were independently conceived, and so did not always pick the same ratios to metric units for each avoirdupois unit. The result of this was, after these standardisations, measurements of the same name often had marginally different recognised values in different regions (although the pound generally remained very similar). In the modern day, this is evident in the small difference between United States customary and British Imperial pounds.

An alternative system of mass, the troy system, is generally used for precious materials. The modern definition of the avoirdupois pound (1 lb) is exactly kilograms.

== Etymology ==

 is from Anglo-Norman French (later ), literally &quot;goods of weight&quot; (Old French , as verb meaning &quot;to have&quot; and as noun meaning &quot;property, goods&quot;, comes from the Latin , &quot;to have, to hold, to possess something&quot;; = &quot;from&quot;/&quot;of&quot;, cf. Latin; = &quot;weight&quot;, from Latin .) This term originally referred to a class of merchandise: , &quot;goods of weight&quot;, things that were sold in bulk and were weighed on large steelyards or balances. 
Only later did the term become identified with a particular &quot;system of units&quot; used to weigh such merchandise. Inconsistent orthography throughout history has left many variants of the term, such as and . (The Norman became the Parisian . In the 17th century was replaced with .)

The current spelling of the last word is in the current standard French orthography, but the spelling &quot;avoirdupois&quot; remained as is in the anglosphere.

==History==

The rise in use of the measurement system corresponds to the regrowth of trade during the High Middle Ages after the early crusades, when Europe experienced a growth in towns, turned from the chaos of warlordism to long-distance trade, and began annual fairs, tournaments and commerce, by land and sea. There are two major hypotheses regarding the origins of the avoirdupois system. The older hypothesis is that it originated in France. A newer hypothesis is that it is based on the weight system of Florence.

The avoirdupois weight system is thought to have come into use in England around 1300. It was originally used for weighing wool. In the early 14th century several other specialized weight systems were used, including the weight system of the Hanseatic League with a 16-ounce pound of grains and an 8-ounce mark. However, the main weight system, used for coinage and for everyday use, was based on the 12-ounce tower pound of grains. From the 14th century until the late 16th century, the system&#x27;s basis and the prototype for today&#x27;s international pound, the avoirdupois pound, was also known as the wool pound or the avoirdupois wool pound. 
The earliest known version of the avoirdupois weight system had the following units: a pound of grains, a stone of 14 pounds, a woolsack of 26 stone, an ounce of pound, and finally, the ounce was divided into 16 &quot;parts&quot;.

The earliest known occurrence of the word &quot;avoirdupois&quot; (or some variant thereof) in England is from a document entitled &quot;Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Weights and Measures&quot;). This document is listed in early statute books under the heading &quot;31 Edward I&quot; dated 2 February 1303. More recent statute books list it among statutes of uncertain date. Scholars nowadays believe that it was probably written between 1266 and 1303. Initially a royal memorandum, it eventually took on the force of law and was recognized as a statute by King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I.
It was repealed by the Weights and Measures Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 74). In the &quot;Tractatus&quot;, the word &quot;avoirdupois&quot; refers not to a weight system, but to a class of goods, specifically heavy goods sold by weight, as opposed to goods sold by volume, count, or some other method. Since it is written in Anglo-Norman French, this document is not the first occurrence of the word in the English language.

===Toward a uniformity of measures===

Three major developments occurred during the reign of Edward III (r. 1327–1377). First, a statute cited as 14 Edw 3 Stat. 1 c. 12 (1340) &quot;Bushels and Weights shall be made and sent into every County.&quot;

The second major development is the statute 25 Edw 3 Stat. 5 c. 9 (1350) &quot;The Auncel Weight shall be put out, and Weighing shall be by equal Balance.&quot;

The third development is a set of 14th-century bronze weights at the Westgate Museum in Winchester, England. The weights are in denominations of 7 pounds (corresponding to a unit known as the clip or wool-clip), 14 pounds (stone), 56 pounds (4 stone) and 91 pounds ( sack or woolsack). The 91-pound weight is thought to have been commissioned by Edward III in conjunction with the statute of 1350, while the other weights are thought to have been commissioned in conjunction with the statutes of 1340. The 56-pound weight was used as a reference standard as late as 1588.

A statute of Henry VIII (24 Hen 8 c. 3) made avoirdupois weights mandatory.

In 1588 Queen Elizabeth increased the weight of the avoirdupois pound to grains and added the troy grain to the avoirdupois weight system. Prior to 1588, the &quot;part&quot; ( ounce) was the smallest unit in the avoirdupois weight system. In the 18th century, the &quot;part&quot; was renamed &quot;drachm&quot;.

===Original forms===
These are the units in their original Anglo-Norman French forms:

====Post-Elizabethan units====
In the United Kingdom, 14 avoirdupois pounds equal one stone. The quarter, hundredweight, and ton equal respectively, 28 lb, 112 lb, and 2,240 lb in order for masses to be easily converted between them and stone. The following are the units in the British or imperial version of the avoirdupois system:

&quot;Note:&quot; The plural form of the unit &quot;stone&quot; is either &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;stones&quot;, but &quot;stone&quot; is most frequently used.

===American customary system===

The thirteen British colonies in North America used the avoirdupois system, but continued to use the British system as it was, without the evolution that was occurring in Britain in the use of the stone unit. In 1824 there was landmark new weights and measures legislation in the United Kingdom that the United States did not adopt.

In the United States, quarters, hundredweights, and tons remain defined as 25, 100, and respectively. The quarter is now virtually unused, as is the hundredweight outside of agriculture and commodities. If disambiguation is required, then they are referred to as the smaller &quot;short&quot; units in the United States, as opposed to the larger British &quot;long&quot; units. Grains are used worldwide for measuring gunpowder and smokeless powder charges. Historically, the dram ( grains; not to be mixed up with the apothecaries&#x27; dram of 60 grains) has also been used worldwide for measuring gunpowder charges, particularly for shotguns and large black-powder rifles.

<text>Newburgh () is a town in Orange County, New York, United States. It forms part of the Kiryas Joel–Poughkeepsie–Newburgh metropolitan area, which is a part of the New York metropolitan area, and is a suburban satellite of the urbanized city of Newburgh. The city of Newburgh was a part of the town prior to 1865. New York Stewart International Airport is partially located within the township, and much of the land into which it could have been expanded has been turned into Stewart State Forest.

As of the 2020 census, the population of the town is 31,985. The 2010 census determined the population was 29,801, marking the first time ever that the population of the town of Newburgh officially exceeded that of the neighboring city of Newburgh (with a population of 28,866). Estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau during 2018 show the Newburgh township&#x27;s population exceeded 30,000. As of 2020 the town and neighboring city of Newburgh had a combined population of 60,842.

The town of Newburgh is known as the &quot;crossroads of the Northeast&quot;, a phrase coined in the 1980s by then-town supervisor Robert J. Kirkpatrick Jr., not only because of Stewart Airport and the Hudson River, but also because two major interstate highways cross the town: Interstate 84 (east and west) and Interstate 87, also known as the New York State Thruway (north and south). Previously, the highways were accessible to each other via a short stretch of New York State Route 300 (a major north–south thoroughfare and a main commercial corridor in the town) but a direct connection between I-84 and the Thruway was completed in December 2009, after being under construction for five years.

==History==
Newburgh was originally settled in 1709 by German Palatine refugees under the name of &quot;Neuburg&quot;, who were soon supplemented by a significant number of Scottish immigrants. It was chartered as a precinct in 1762. It was while Newburgh was a precinct, during the closing months of the American Revolutionary War, that General George Washington established his headquarters at the Hasbrouck House in what is now the city of Newburgh. It was during this time that the Newburgh letter was written by Lewis Nicola and the Newburgh Conspiracy took place.

Newburgh was rechartered as a town in 1788. At that time, it was a part of Ulster County. In 1798, the town of Newburgh and several other towns in southern Ulster County were transferred to Orange County, to compensate for the southernmost part of Orange County being cut away to form Rockland County. The town of Newburgh has remained a part of Orange County ever since. The village of Newburgh was incorporated in 1800. Then as now, villages in New York State remained a part of their parent towns. However, when the village was re-chartered as the city of Newburgh in 1865, it became totally independent of the town.
The town of Newburgh remained overwhelmingly rural and sparsely populated until well into the 20th century. There were many apple orchards in the northern part of the town, and dairy and vegetable farms in the remainder of the town. It is believed one of the largest was Brookside Dairy Farm, just west of the city of Newburgh on the north side of the old Newburgh-Cochecton Turnpike (now Route 17K). The farm was owned by the Stewart family (which gave both Stewart Avenue on the site and Stewart International Airport their names) and ran as far north as South Plank Road, now also known as Route 52. It was known in its day for its state of the art facilities which produced dairy products in an innovative and scientific way. The farm also included an ice business on the banks of Brookside Pond. After World War II, the southern part of the farm became a popular drive-in theater, and the northern part was the site of a baseball stadium known as Tarr Oval, which was used by the Newburgh Little League for many years. The PepsiCo bottling plant and corporate offices are now located on the site of Tarr Oval.

Since Orange Lake is nearly 600 feet above sea level, its outlet stream (sometimes called Bushfield Creek) powered many varied mills as it wound its way to the Hudson River, including a saw mill, grist mill and coinage mill right at the outlet from the lake, all owned by Thomas Machin. A flour mill stood where the stream now travels beneath Route 300. In a different part of town, the Gidney family operated a grist mill on Gidneytown Creek. Today, the site of the Gidney Mill is owned by the town, and the old brick chimney from the mill remains standing and is marked by an historic site marker. The animal control center for the town is also located on this property. The old gunpowder mills in what is now Algonquin Park today serve as the focal point of the only historic district in the town. For many years, there was a bleachery owned by the Chadwick Family.

In the 19th century, hamlets sprung up throughout the town, between farms. These were small communities which (typically) consisted of a general store, a church, sometimes a cemetery, and a post office, quite often in the home of the postmaster or as part of the general store. Each hamlet also included a few scattered homes, often of tradespeople.

The population of the town of Newburgh was only 4,246 in 1900 and 6,092 in 1940, on the eve of World War II. However, after World War II the population skyrocketed as more and more farmland and forestland was converted to housing developments. Many of the new residents of the town in the 1940s and 1950s were World War II veterans who were able to purchase their own homes under the provisions of the G.I. Bill. Also, the booming economy after World War II allowed many families to afford to purchase automobiles, which made residency in the suburbs away from central city cores practical for the first time. In addition, parents of baby boomer children desired to raise these children in a suburban or rural atmosphere as opposed to crowded city life.

Also after World War II, the costs of continued farming, especially shipping costs, made farming more and more unprofitable. Many farm owners subdivided their farms for home building, and some were forced by financial reasons to do so. This post-World War II housing explosion pretty well petered out by the time of the energy crisis and recession in the early to mid-1970s. This lull in new housing was also a result of the departure of many major employers who left the city of Newburgh and other surrounding communities to relocate in southern states, where the cost of labor was much cheaper. This exodus of local employment climaxed with the closing of Stewart Air Force Base—by far the region&#x27;s largest employer—in 1970. There are several housing developments—Wedgewood Park being perhaps the most prominent example—which received subdevelopment and building approval in the 1960s but were not actually built until many years later.

Home building started again in the late 1980s as more and more New York City, Westchester County, and Rockland County residents fled urban sprawl and spiraling tax rates. While in the 1950s and 1960s a drive of two to three hours one way to commute to work was unacceptable, by the 1990s many people considered it routine.

The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the town grew by 3,000 just in the five-year period from 2000 to 2005 alone. Since 2000, homes in virtually every part of the town are being built on lots which twenty years ago were considered unsuitable for this purpose.

The town became less and less a residential suburb for local employees and more and more a &quot;bedroom&quot; community for commuters to jobs outside the region.

In 1960, the population was 15,547. It went over 20,000 by 1970, and nearly exceeded 30,000 in the 21st century.

On January 5, 2010, the United States Census Bureau opened an office at 1437 Route 300, just south of the intersection with Route 52, which oversaw the 2010 census count in Orange, Sullivan and Delaware counties.

While the census count in 2010 showed that, for the first time in history the population of the town of Newburgh exceeded that of the city of Newburgh, the population increase was not sufficient to render the town the most populous municipality in Orange County. The towns of Monroe and Warwick, located in the southern part of Orange County in the path of commuter routes, both greatly exceeded the town of Newburgh in 2010, despite both being rural farm communities of less than 10,000 each fifty years earlier.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (7.04%) is water.

The northern town line and approximately one third of the western town line is the border of Ulster County, and the eastern town line, marked by the Hudson River, is the border of Dutchess County.

The town of Newburgh is bordered on the north by the town of Plattekill (Ulster County) and the town of Marlborough (Ulster County), which includes the hamlet of Marlboro. It is bordered on the west by the town of Shawangunk (Ulster County) which includes the hamlet of Wallkill and by the town of Montgomery (Orange County), which includes the villages of Walden, Montgomery and Maybrook. The entire southern boundary is with the town of New Windsor (Orange County) with the exception of a quadrant, nearly a perfect quadrilateral in shape, adjoining the town at its southeast corner. This is the city of Newburgh. The eastern boundary of the town of Newburgh is the Hudson River, which separates it from the Dutchess County towns of Poughkeepsie, Wappinger, and Fishkill.

===Topography===
The town of Newburgh has a hilly terrain. Although bounded on the east by the Hudson River, access to that river is severely limited from the town because most of the shoreline is typified by steep bluffs.

Several hills in the town of Newburgh exceed above sea level. The southern tip of Marlboro Mountain, most of which including the summit is located in Ulster County, extends southward into the town of Newburgh east of Pressler Road and west of Frozen Ridge Road. While the peak of the mountain in Ulster County is over above sea level, the southernmost extremity of the mountain in the town of Newburgh is over . Fox Hill, in the northwestern corner of the town near the boundary with the town of Shawangunk, also exceeds . Its sister peak of Kings Hill, across Route 300, is also over high. Straddling the border with the town of Shawangunk, it is dominated by a large Christian cross, lit at night, erected and maintained at the summit by the private property owner.

The most prominent elevation in the town, due to its central location, is Cronomer Hill. The summit of Cronomer Hill, the name of which derives from an Indian chief who allegedly lived atop the hill during Revolutionary War times, is above sea level. Most of Cronomer Hill is now a park owned and maintained by Orange County and remains heavily forested. The summit, accessible by auto via a road intersecting with Route 32, features an observation tower from which can be seen views of major portions of the mid Hudson Valley, including the Newburgh Beacon Bridge in its entirely, much of Dutchess County across the Hudson, and major portions of Stewart Airport to the southwest, as well as much of the city of Newburgh and town of New Windsor. A cell phone tower is at the summit of Cronomer Hill.

Another prominent elevation in the town is Prospect Hill, behind Fostertown School, about above sea level. Prospect Hill is traversed on its eastern side by Frozen Ridge Road, so called due to the name popularly given to the steep ridge north of Prospect Hill.

Prospect Hill Road is in the extreme northwest corner of the town of Newburgh, nowhere near Prospect Hill itself.

The two Rossville hills flank either side of New York Route 32 just south of the town border, near the intersection with East Road. They are each about above sea level. Other elevations in the town of Newburgh worthy of mention are Soap Hill and Cedar Cliff, each overlooking the Hudson in the extreme northeast corner of town. Although each is less than above sea level, their close proximity to the Hudson River renders them picturesque.

==Demographics==

The median income for a household from 2014 to 2018 was $87,602 and the mean income was $105,061, making the town of Newburgh wealthier than the city of Newburgh.

== Education ==
An 1875 map on display at Town Hall indicates that at that time 14 different school districts existed in Newburgh, each of which had its own schoolhouse, each of which elected its own school board, and each of which hired its own teachers. As late as the mid-1950s, it was common in the town for one teacher to teach more than one grade in one classroom.

In the post-World War II era, with the first explosion in population in the town (as the town began the transition from rural to suburban) as well as with &quot;Baby boomers&quot; beginning their schooling, the need came about for larger and more modern school buildings. During the 1950s, new elementary schools were built in Balmville, Gardnertown, East Coldenham, Leptondale and Union Grove. Fostertown School retained its older building, but the first of several modern additions was constructed in 1957.

Each of these elementary schools had their own locally elected school boards. Each had clearly defined boundaries which determined which elementary school each student would attend. Attendance at high school was not universal prior to World War II, but after that time most Newburgh students attended the two junior high schools (North Junior High and South Junior High) and one high school (Newburgh Free Academy, popularly known as NFA) in the city of Newburgh.

In 1963, the Newburgh Enlarged City School District was formed. It consisted of the entire city of Newburgh and most of the town of New Windsor. In addition, it absorbed the following school districts within the town of Newburgh: Balmville (District One), Orange Lake (District Three), Fostertown (District Four), Gardnertown (District Eight), and Union Grove (District Eleven).

Roseton (District Five) and Middlehope (District Nine) joined the Unified Marlboro School District in Ulster County, much to the distress of the Newburgh School officials, who were counting on the tax revenue from the Central Hudson power plants in Roseton, which at the time consisted of about 55% of the total tax base in the town of Newburgh (today that ratio is about 32%).

East Coldenham (District Ten) joined the Valley Central School District, centered in the town of Montgomery.

Leptondale (District Fourteen), due to physical proximity, always sent its students to Wallkill Middle School and Wallkill High School, in Ulster County, which is much closer than Newburgh Free Academy (NFA). For this reason, Leptondale is a part of the Wallkill Central School District. Both schools were built by the Borden family, of dairy fame. In fact, Wallkill Middle School was renamed John G. Borden School in 2004.

There are four different school districts in the town of Newburgh–each of them headquartered in a different surrounding municipality.

The new Meadow Hill Elementary School, built in 1970 in what was at that time the fastest growing portion of the town, replaced Union Grove school, which was eventually demolished.

In the early 1970s, the courts mandated busing to achieve racial balance. In response, the elementary schools in the Newburgh Enlarged City School District, including those within the town of Newburgh, became magnet schools. Geography no longer determines which elementary school each student attends.

School taxes in the Newburgh Enlarged City School District and in the Wallkill School District are still collected by school district tax collectors who are employees of those school districts. School taxes in these districts cannot be accepted by the Receiver of Taxes at Newburgh Town Hall. School taxes in the Marlboro and Valley Central School Districts, on the other hand, &quot;must&quot; be paid to the Town of Newburgh Receiver of Taxes because these school districts do not have their own tax collectors on their payrolls.

There are a total of 13,027 taxable parcels of property in the town of Newburgh.

== Government ==
The old building on the corner of NY 300 and Gardnertown Road dates back to the early 20th century and was originally Gardnertown Elementary School. When the current school, now called Gardnertown Magnet School, was built in the mid-1950s, this building became Newburgh Town Hall. It remained so until 1973, when the current town hall was built right next door. At that point, the historic old building became police headquarters. When the current police headquarters was built in the late 1980s, adjacent but in the other direction, facing Gardnertown Road, this building became a secondary town hall, housing the code compliance, building, zoning, and planning board offices.

Like all of the towns within New York State, Newburgh is governed by a town board. In Newburgh, the board consists of four councilpersons, and a town supervisor who presides and exercises limited executive authority. The supervisor is elected to a two-year term, in odd numbered years. The four councilpersons are elected to four-year terms, but are staggered so that two are elected in each odd numbered year. A town clerk is also elected to a two-year term, concurrent with the supervisor, and a receiver of taxes is elected to a four-year term. Unlike most towns in New York State, the assessor of real property is not an elected official, but is appointed by the town board. Likewise the superintendent of highways is appointed, not elected. Two town justices are elected to four-year terms: one in odd numbered years; the other (due to a midterm death in 1997) in even numbered years. The town justices (formerly called justices of the peace) are the chief judicial officials of the town, and since 1963 no longer sit as members of the town board, as had previously been the case.

Newburgh is one of twenty towns in Orange County. There are also three cities in Orange County. Despite its size, it is one of only eight towns in the county to contain no incorporated villages.

==Transportation==

Stewart International Airport is located partially in the town of Newburgh but mostly in the town of New Windsor.

U.S. Route 9W, New York Route 17K, New York Route 32, New York Route 52, New York Route 207 and New York Route 300 all pass through the town. Two roads in the town of Newburgh are owned and maintained by Orange County: County Route 23 (known locally as Rock Cut Road and Forest Road) and County Route 86 (Fostertown Road). All other public roads are maintained by the Town Highway Department, headquartered at 90 Gardnertown Road. However, there are many private roads in the Town of Newburgh.

Interstate 84 passes through from east to west and has a junction with Interstate 87 (the New York State Thruway). In 2011, the NYSDOT administered the milling and repaving of Interstate 84 through the town from the Interstate 87 interchange to the NY 17K exit. This work also included replacing steel bridge joints with epoxy-based bridge joints. The prime contractor was Tilcon New York Inc., a West Nyack, New York based contractor.

Short Line, part of Coach USA, also provides daily service along U.S. Route 9W heading to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan and West Point Military Academy.

== Communities and locations in the town ==

*Algonquin Park – Although completely surrounded by the town of Newburgh, this parkland was donated by private developers (who had purchased the property with the intent of building homes on it) to the city of Newburgh for use as a park. Part of the land was purchased and donated to the city by Frederic Delano, a local resident who was the uncle of future President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Newburgh Lion&#x27;s Club added land to the donation in the 1930s, and it remained a City of Newburgh park until the mid-1970s, at which time the city could no longer maintain its upkeep. After lying idle for several years, Orange County took it over and today it remains a part of the County Parks and Recreation Department. The ruins of the old gunpowder mill on the parkland is one of only two such remnants in the United States, and is part of the Orange Mill Historic District, the only Historic District within the Town.
*Algonquin Park Boulder – A centerpiece of Algonquin Park had long been a huge boulder which had been in place at least since the Ice Age. Children played on and around it and park patrons of all ages utilized it as a resting place, shade oasis, and a place for meeting. On several occasions the County attempted to remove the boulder, only to face strong opposition from local residents. In the early 1990s, then County Executive Mary McPhillips suggested it be removed for safety reasons. Local historic and civic groups impressed on County officials the landmark status and sentimental value of the boulder and obtained pledges that it would never be removed. In the mid-1990s, a new administration in the County seat again proposed removing the rock, this time for the purpose of constructing a soccer field. The county was presented with petitions signed by over 600 residents asking that the boulder be retained. The then-County Executive, Joseph Rampe, and the Commissioner of Parks, Graham Skea, both pledged that the boulder would never be removed. The soccer field was built just north of Gardnertown Road, also County parkland, so it was assumed there was no longer any threat to the boulder. Then, on the morning of June 25, 2008, the sound of jackhammers alerted neighbors that the boulder was being destroyed. It was soon a pile of rubble. The destruction of the boulder took place on the second to the last day on the job of Parks Commissioner J. Brett Simmons, who succeeded Skea upon the latter&#x27;s retirement. Simmons informed no one of the decision to remove the boulder—no County official and no Town official. A blasting permit from the Town of Newburgh was not needed because no blasting was involved. County Executive Ed Diana was not informed of the decision to destroy the rock, and in any case was unaware of the pledges made by his predecessors to retain the rock. Local press coverage underscored the outright grief and rage of local park users and historical buffs. Les Cornell, Newburgh Town Historian, noted that the boulder was located in the only historic district within the Town, and questioned if any historic landmark is now safe. But the damage was done and is irreversible.
*Amber Fields – A development built in the late 1980s on the west side of Fletcher Drive North just north of Interstate 84.
*Balmville – A hamlet in the eastern part of the town, immediately north of the city of Newburgh.
*Brighton Green – a condominium townhouse complex on the north side of Meadow Hill Road, across from Meadow Hill Reformed Church at the end of Fletcher Drive North, opened to occupancy in 2007.
*Candlestick Hill – An area along the northern border which until recent years was still completely rural with apple orchards. Since 2000, the site of explosive new home building. A large mobile home park has been located here since the mid-1960s.
*Cedar Cliff – Was a hamlet in the extreme northeast corner of Town, at the point where the Orange-Ulster County border meets the Hudson River. According to old maps, in the late 19th century it had its own post office and school, but today exists only as the name of a hill and of a short dead-end road which runs perpendicular to Old Post Road and the river.
*Cedar Hill Cemetery – an interdenominational cemetery, is the largest cemetery in the Town of Newburgh. It is on the east side of Route 9W, just north of Middle Hope, west of Roseton, and southwest of Cedar Cliff. It was founded in the 1850s. Notables buried there include Andrew Jackson Downing, the landscape architect closely associated with the City of Newburgh, and Eric Carr, drummer for the rock group Kiss.
*Chadwick Lake – A manmade lake in the northwestern part of the town, owned and maintained for recreational purposes by the Town government. It is surrounded by Chadwick Lake Park, a Town park. It is also the secondary water supply for the Town, the first being the Delaware Aqueduct (New York City). The town maintains recreational and park facilities around the southern end of the lake, including playgrounds, picnic facilities, a skating rink and basketball court, a concert stage, and hiking trails, one of which encircles the entire lake. Recreational fishing is allowed, with big mouth bass being the most popular catch in the lake, which is well stocked. The lake is man made. The lake was created when the property owners, the Chadwick family, constructed a dam across Quassaick Creek in 1926. For that reason, the lake does not appear on any 19th-century maps. The Town purchased the lake from the Chadwick Family in 1962 with the intent of using it as a water supply. Some older commercial maps erroneously label the lake &quot;Cronomer Lake&quot; probably due to its proximity to the hamlet of Cronomer Valley and to Cronomer Hill, but there is no evidence that this name was ever used locally for the lake either officially or informally.
*Cronomer Hill Park – owned and maintained by the Orange County Parks and Recreation Department, the portion near the summit of the hill is richly forested. The portion of the park which extends down the southwest slope, to and across Gardnertown Road to Powder Mill Road, includes soccer and baseball fields, and tennis courts. This portion of the park is the site of Town of Newburgh &quot;Community Day&quot; every year the last worknight prior to July 4. It features local vendors and concludes with a fireworks display. The most prominent elevation in the Town, due to its central location, is Cronomer Hill. The summit of Cronomer Hill, the name of which derives from an Indian chief who allegedly lived atop the hill during Revolutionary War times, is above sea level. Most of Cronomer Hill is now a park owned and maintained by Orange County and remains heavily forested. The summit, accessible by auto via a road intersecting with Route 32, features an observation tower from which can be seen extensive views of major portions of the mid Hudson Valley, including the Newburgh Beacon Bridge in its entirely, much of Dutchess County across the Hudson, and major portions of Stewart Airport to the southwest, as well as much of the City of Newburgh and Town of New Windsor. On a clear day, visible on the horizon, is High Point, the highest point in the state of New Jersey, which is marked by an obelisk. A cell phone tower is at the summit of Cronomer Hill.
*Cronomer Valley – nestled between Fostertown and Cronomer Hill. The confusing, unusual junction of New York State Routes 32 and 300 in the hamlet has locally been known as &quot;Holt&#x27;s Corner&quot; in honor of the family which has long owned property and businesses at and near the intersection, members of which live in the vicinity of the intersection to this day. The &quot;Cronomer Valley Fire Department&quot; is located on Route 32 about 2/10 mile southeast of Holt&#x27;s Corner.
*Danskammer Point – is a small peninsula which juts into the Hudson River north of Roseton and south of Cedar Cliff, at the base of Soap Hill. &quot;Danskammer&quot; is Dutch for &quot;dance chamber&quot; and was so named by the earliest Dutch settlers because Native Americans would conduct ritual dances by firelight on this point. In the 1930s, the Central Hudson company built the Danskammer Generating Station, an electric generating plant, at this site. The plant was expanded in the 1970s in such a way that it eradicated most of the Hamlet of Roseton. Today, the power complex is owned and operated by the Dynegy company. The plant is oil generated, and the oil crisis of the mid to late 2000s rendered the plant uneconomical to operate. Accordingly, as of 2008, it is off line all but a handful of days a year.
*DuPont Park – an old subdivision laid out in the 1920s, but due to the Great Depression of the 1930s, most of the houses weren&#x27;t built until the mid-1940s, immediately after World War II. The east–west street is Waring Road (named after original property owners) and the north–south streets were named Innis Avenue and DuPont Avenue. The original subdivision map indicated extremely small building lots by today&#x27;s standards, but when actual home construction began, larger, more conventional size lots were utilized. Both the original lots and the lots actually used are indicated on the tax maps on file in the Town Assessor&#x27;s office. The original plans of the subdivision called for a canal to be built equidistant between Innis Avenue and DuPont Avenue, between the backyards of the homes. However, the canal never came to be. In the early 1960s, the town changed the name of DuPont Avenue to Algonquin Drive, to end confusion with the DuPont Avenue in the City of Newburgh. The subdivision is immediately across Powder Mill Road from Algonquin Park, and the original developers intended to extend the subdivision through that land, but instead donated it to the City of Newburgh for use as a park.
*East Coldenham – A hamlet and the site of the East Coldenham Elementary School disaster in 1989. The hamlet is a part of the Valley Central School District. Named after Cadwallader Colden (1688–1776), last Royalist Lieutenant Governor of New York Province prior to the Revolutionary War, and an author, botanist, surveyor and farmer. His home was in the Town of Montgomery a few hundred feet west of the current Town of Newburgh boundary. The large Colden Park housing development, built in the mid-1950s on the south side of Route 17K, and the smaller Fleetwood Development on the opposite side of 17K, are located here. In recent years, the former Colden Park Homeowners Association has encouraged the use of East Coldenham as the name for the entire area. Although Colden Park is an extremely large development, Arbor Drive is the only entrance and exit.
*East Leptondale – A vaguely defined region east of Leptondale and west of Cronomer Valley.
*Fenlo Park – one of the first post-World War II developments in Town, consisted of Stanley Place, Roy Place, Noel Drive, Helene Terrace, and the westernmost part of Chestnut Lane. The homes were built 1953–59. The designation fell into disuse as newer, contiguous developments were built. Stanley, Roy, Noel and Helene were the children of the developer.
*Folin Heights – the old name (which has fallen into disuse) for the Carter Avenue corridor, has views of the Hudson and the valley.
*Fostertown – A hamlet centered on the intersection where Fostertown Road, North Fostertown Drive, New Road, Weyants Lane and Owens Road meet. Through the 1950s, a farming community. Gidneytown Creek flows under North Fostertown Drive just north of this intersection, and under Fostertown Road (also known as County Road 86) just east of it. A development, with streets named after Revolutionary War battles (Saratoga Road, Valley Forge Dr., etc.) was built in the 1960s behind Fostertown School to the northeast, going up the side of Prospect Hill. &quot;Fostertown Crossing&quot;, built in the late 1990s, is directly in back of Fostertown School. The homes in Fostertown Crossing can be described as palatial. The central part of &quot;Fostertown School&quot; is believed to be the oldest school building still in use in the Town of Newburgh for educational purposes, although additions were built in 1957, 1961, and 1988. A church at the intersection of Fostertown Road and North Fostertown Drive, formerly called Fostertown Methodist, is believed to be the oldest church building still in use for religious purposes in the Town of Newburgh, having been built in 1833. The original Parsonage was built in 1964 and the fellowship hall followed in 1966. On January 1, 1976, Fostertown Methodist Church merged with two other Methodist churches in the Town of Newburgh (Middle Hope and Rossville) to become &quot;Trinity United Methodist Parish&quot; (see below). An old cemetery connected with the church is north of the church building, on North Fostertown Drive, adjacent to a modern entrance to Fostertown Crossing.
*Fostertown Heights – The region on the ridge just west of Fostertown. Panoramic views of much of the Mid Hudson Valley are still available from along Fostertown Road, south of the Sarvis Lane intersection.
*Frozen Ridge – a bluff with views of the Fostertown valley and the southern tip of Marlboro Mountain, was apple orchards and forest until the late 20th century, and is now experiencing explosive home building.
*Gardnertown – A hamlet named after the Silas Gardner family, whose home is still standing and in private use. Since Gardnertown is the geographic center of the Town of Newburgh, most of the government buildings, including Town Hall, Police Headquarters, and the Code Compliance building, are located here. Gardnertown does not have its own zip code, but a branch of the Newburgh Post Office was located here from 1978 to 2012 in a strip mall.
*Gidneytown – a once prosperous hamlet located at what is now the intersection of Gidney Avenue and Route 32. A grist mill, thriving in the late 18th and throughout the 19th centuries and owned by the Gidney family, was located here on the banks of Gidneytown Creek. Only the brick chimney remains, an historic site which stands on Town owned property. An historical marker on the site recounts a brief history of the Gidney grist mill. This property was the site of a controversial wastewater treatment plant which operated from 1963 until the sewer lines were consolidated and the plant demolished in 1989. This plant was one of several in the Hudson valley targeted by the Riverkeeper organization. The Town of Newburgh Animal Shelter is currently located on this town-owned property. Until the late 1950s, a body of water known as Gidney Pond was a popular local swimming, fishing and ice skating hole. It was filled in after a child drowned. A shopping mall and other commercial and retail establishments are now on the site of Gidney Pond. Another, much smaller, body of water which appears on old Town maps was Grimm&#x27;s Pond, a local fishing hole on the southwest corner of Gidney Avenue and Gardnertown Road. This former body of water is now marshland traversed by Gidneytown Creek.
*Glenwood Park – A former hamlet which was located around the current site of the &quot;Good Will Fire Department&quot;.
*Gomez Mill House – the earliest known surviving Jewish residence in the country and the oldest home in Orange County listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
*Hy Vue Terrace – a development built in the mid-1950s on the northeast side of North Plank Road, originally received a great deal of publicity because all the houses were brick. The original streets in the development were Hy Vue Drive, Hy Vue Court, and Hy Vue Circle. Later, Hy Vue Drive was extended up the hill where additional homes were built.
*Leptondale – Northwest corner of the Town. Leptondale is not a part of the Enlarged Newburgh City School District, but is part of the Wallkill School District. Today it remains the most rural part of the Town, although much new housing construction has taken place since 2000. The zip code for the area is 12589. Much of Leptondale is in the Plattekill Fire District. While the main Plattekill fire house is in Ulster County, a substation has recently been built on Forest Road to service Leptondale.
*Meadow Hill – Largest development within the town boundaries. Divided into North, South, and West quadrants. (Meadow Hill East is actually Gardnertown) All street names in Meadow Hill South are related to horses (Pommel Drive, Paddock Place, Coach Lane, etc.) All street names in Meadow Hill North but one are related to royalty or diplomacy (Monarch Drive, Ambassador Lane, Royal Circle, etc.) All street names in Meadow Hill West are British (Victoria Drive, Picadilly Circle, etc.) Was farmland prior to the 1960s. Meadow Hill North is located on property which was a dairy farm owned by the Patton family. It was traversed by an unpaved dirt road known as Patton Road. Today, Patton Road – which follows the exact route of the old unpaved dirt road – is the only thoroughfare in Meadow Hill North not having a royalty or diplomacy related name.
*Meadow Winds – A new development built in the late 1990s and early 2000s on a hill on the south side of Route 52 immediately west of the New York Thruway. It was built on property formerly known as Lawrence Farms. It consists of free standing one family homes, attached town houses, and condominiums, and has views of much of the town.
*Middlehope – A hamlet in the northeast part of the town. Formerly called Middletown because it was halfway between the Newburgh city and the town of Marlborough, the name was changed in the 19th century to avoid confusion with the city called Middletown, also in Orange County. Middlehope was long the center of the apple growing industry in the town of Newburgh, including cold storage facilities. Towards the close of the first decade of the 21st century, the last of the apple orchards have been transformed into housing developments. When the school districts consolidated in 1963, the Middlehope school district opted to consolidate with the Unified Marlboro School District rather than the Newburgh Enlarged City School District. The &quot;Middlehope Elementary School&quot; was built on Overlook Drive. The &quot;Middlehope Fire Department&quot; is located on Lattintown Road a few hundred feet west of Route 9W, with a substation to the south, at the corner of 9W and Balmville Road. A Methodist church flourished in Middlehope for many years, until it merged with two other Methodist Churches in the Town of Newburgh to form &quot;Trinity United Methodist Parish&quot; (see below) in 1976.
*Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike – one of the oldest roads in the state (1801), it is today New York State Route 17K.
*Newburgh Gardens – an area just north of the hamlet of Glenwood Park, is believed to be the oldest subdivision in the town of Newburgh. The building lots are much smaller than in the rest of the town, streets are narrower, and tax maps indicate many &quot;paper&quot; streets. The older homes are extremely small, although more recently constructed houses can be quite large. Originally, the five north–south thoroughfares in the subdivision were named Dix Avenue, Wilson Avenue, Taft Avenue, Roosevelt Avenue, and Fifth Avenue. In 1912, Woodrow Wilson, William Howard Taft, and Theodore Roosevelt ran against each other for President of the United States. That same year, John Alden Dix was Governor of New York. Accordingly, it is assumed by Town officials and local historic buffs that the subdivision was conceived in or soon after 1912. Dix Avenue was divided into a north section and a south section by the construction of Interstate 84 in 1963, which bisects the neighborhood. Wilson Avenue is today truncated to one block long, Roosevelt Avenue was renamed Schullman Lane to avoid confusion with a Roosevelt Place in the City of Newburgh, and Taft and Fifth Avenues remain today as major, heavily trafficked north–south thoroughfares.
*&quot;North Plank Road&quot; and &quot;South Plank Road&quot; were two plank roads, roughly parallel and approximately two miles apart, constructed by competing turnpike companies in the 1840s. Tolls were charged on both of these roads. Both began at what is now the City of Newburgh limits and extended westward into the Shawangunk and eventually Catskill Mountains. Today, North Plank Road is designated as New York State Route 32 from Route 9W as far as Holt&#x27;s Corner in Cronomer Valley, after which point it is designated Route 300. South Plank Road is New York State Route 52 its entire length. The U.S. Postal Service still recognizes North Plank Road as the official address for all mail along the Route 32 portion of the highway, as do the local government and emergency services. This is despite the fact that there is not one single sign identifying the thoroughfare as North Plank Road anywhere on its entire length. Mail addressed to recipients beyond Cronomer Valley must be addressed to Route 300, and will be returned to sender if addressed North Plank Road. (This determination was made as a part of the &quot;911&quot; emergency system renumbering in the mid-1990s.) The Postal Service, local government, and emergency services recognize South Plank Road as the official designation for that entire road, even though, just as is the case with North Plank Road, there is no signage whatsoever the entire length of the highway identifying it as such. From 1895 until 1926, an electric railway ran along South Plank Road from downtown city of Newburgh through the entire length of the Town of Newburgh to the Village of Walden to the west. This electric railway (popularly referred to as the trolley) was a major factor in the success of the amusement park at Orange Lake. There are three side roads designated as Old South Plank Road---one in Gardnertown, one in Orange Lake, and one at the Montgomery Town line. Contrary to local belief, these are not shunpike roads but were the location of South Plank Road prior to the state takeover and paving in the 1920s. Likewise there is an Old North Plank Road. A tavern located on that road claims to be a former toll house from the turnpike days. Another side road, Paffendorf Drive, was known as Old North Plank Road until the early 1960s, when the name was changed to avoid confusion.
*Orange Lake – A lake in the western part of the town. At , it is believed to be the largest lake located entirely within Orange County.
*Orange Lake – A hamlet east of Orange Lake. It was a resort area prior to World War II, and the site of an amusement park prior to 1941. Prior to 1950, a night club on the shore of the lake attracted internationally known performers, such as Frank Sinatra and Benny Goodman. The hamlet is the site of &quot;Our Lady of the Lake&quot;, one of two Roman Catholic mission churches in the Town of Newburgh. It is also the location of the Dan Leghorn Volunteer Fire Department, founded around 1900.
*Plattekill Turnpike – One of the oldest roads in the Town of Newburgh, appearing on the earliest available maps, it began in the hamlet of Gardnertown just east of the point where Gardnertown Road crosses Quassaick Creek. It proceeded north parallel to the creek, and intersected with North Plank Road in the hamlet of Cronomer Valley at what later became known as Holt&#x27;s Corner. It then continued north, still parallel to and east of Quassaick Creek, through the hamlet of Savilton (Rossville) and across the Ulster County line into the Town of Plattekill. In the 1920s, the portion north of North Plank Road was designated New York State Route 32. Because Plattekill Turnpike terminated at Gardnertown Road, it could not be used as a cross-town north–south thoroughfare. Union Avenue, however, did extend south into the Town of New Windsor. In order to proceed from Plattekill Turnpike southbound onto Union Avenue southbound, it was necessary to make a sharp right onto Gardnertown Road, continue for half a mile northwest to Gardnertown Church, and then make a sharp left onto Union Avenue. Sometime between 1935 and 1946, Orange County constructed a new road, designated as Union Avenue Extension, as a short cut to eliminate those sharp turns and cut the travel distance in half. The County took over this entire Plattekill Turnpike-Union Avenue Extension-Union Avenue corridor and designated it County Route 28. It quickly became a major north–south thoroughfare. The remainder of Plattekill Turnpike not a part of this corridor, a short stub just north of Gardnertown Road, became a seldom used secondary road. In the early 1980s, the state took over County Route 28 (as well as all of Union Avenue south of Route 52) and redesignated it New York Route 300. Finally, with the adoption of the 911 Emergency renumbering system in the mid-1990s, the name Plattekill Turnpike was totally discontinued and suppressed for all official and postal purposes, with the exception of the small stub south of the former Union Avenue Extension. This small Town road, on which are located Gardnertown Elementary School and about half a dozen houses, is still called Plattekill Turnpike to the consternation of newer residents, since it is not located anywhere near, nor does it lead to, the Town of Plattekill. It also has caused difficulty for persons seeking the Town of Newburgh Justice Court Building, which for many years used to be 105 Plattekill Turnpike. The same building is now designated 311 Route 32.
*Powelton Club – an exclusive private country club in the Hamlet of Balmville, it is one of the ten oldest country clubs in the United States and is on the National Register of Historic Places.
*Powelton Farms – a development begun in the mid-1950s and which includes the westernmost part of the old Powelton estate, owned for many years by the Ramsdell family. The eastern part of this estate became the Powelton Club in the 1880s. The new routing of Route 9W cut through the center of the estate in the late 1920s. Powelton Farms is the part of the estate west of Route 9W but east of the old Gidney estate. The streets include Powelton Road and Powelton Circle, as well as Sunset Drive, Meadow Street, Chadwick Place, Hideaway Lane, and Catalpa Road. Winding Lane, despite its name, is straight from its beginning on Route 32 to its termination at Catalpa Road. However, old maps at Town Hall indicate that the farm road which was its precursor included the easternmost part of Catalpa Road, which was extremely &quot;winding&quot;. It is probably from this, rather than a sense of irony or sarcasm, that &quot;Winding Lane&quot; got its name. Powelton Farms was originally a part of the old Balmville school district and to this day its residents consider themselves Balmville residents. Rob Cohen, the noted motion picture director and producer, grew up in this neighborhood.
*Quassaick Creek – Although mostly known locally as the boundary between the city of Newburgh and town of New Windsor, actually most of the flow of Quassaick Creek is in the town of Newburgh. Made national headlines in the 1980s due to the anti-pollution efforts of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Riverkeeper organization.
*Roseton – for all practical purposes, no longer exists. It was for many years a thriving community anchored around the highly successful brick yards (The Rose Brick Company and The Jova Brick Company) along the banks of the Hudson. It had its own elementary school, grocery store and post office, and even had its own ZIP code (12576) until the mid-1970s. After the brick yards shut down, the Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Company purchased them and most of the private property for expansion of its power plants, and demolished all of the homes east of River Road – almost the entire community. Those power plants were sold to the Dynegy energy company in the late 1990s. &quot;Our Lady of Mercy&quot; chapel, a mission church of St. Mary&#x27;s Parish in Marlboro, long served the Roman Catholic community in Roseton. It is still in service, and while it has offered only one Mass per week since the expansion of the power plants, most times the Mass is standing room only. It is one of two Roman Catholic Mission Churches in the Town of Newburgh, the other being &quot;Our Lady of the Lake&quot; at Orange Lake. New York State DOT directional signs erected on Route 9W in late 2015 point to the hamlet of Roseton indicating correctly that it is one mile (1.6 km) to the east. These replace earlier sings which were confusing. In 1963, the Roseton School District opted to join the Unified Marlboro School District instead of the Newburgh Enlarged City School District, depriving the Newburgh school district of millions of dollars in taxes paid by the power plants. Soon after, Roseton Elementary School was demolished, with the students being sent to the new Middle Hope Elementary School on Overlook Drive.
*Rossville – Rossville is a former hamlet on what is now New York Route 32, just south of the Ulster County border, around the intersection with East Road. All that remains of Rossville as a place name are the building of the former Rossville Methodist Church, now maintained as &quot;The Rossville Library Museum&quot;, and the Rossville Cemetery, formerly maintained by the church. The congregation of Rossville Methodist Church moved to the former Fostertown Methodist Church when the two merged, with Middle Hope Methodist Church, to form &quot;Trinity United Methodist Parish&quot; (see below) in 1976.
*Savilton – Savilton and Rossville are the same place. In the 19th century, when postmasters were allowed to choose their own names for post offices, the names switched back and forth as two different postmasters each named the community after their sons.
*Sherwood Forest – a small development laid out in the late 1950s but built in the early 1960s. The original streets all have names taken from the Robin Hood legend (Nottingham Road, Archery Road, Little John Lane, Yeoman Road), as is the name of the development itself. The only outlet from the subdivision is via Innis Avenue and Algonquin Drive, which merge at the entrance to the subdivision.
*Trinity United Methodist Parish – one body of Christian Fellowship incorporated on January 1, 1976, with the merger of the Fostertown, Middlehope, and Rossville Methodist Churches. The congregation gathers for worship at the former Fostertown Methodist Church, built in 1833 and believed to be the oldest building in the town still used for religious purposes. The church is adjoined by a fellowship hall built in 1966, and a parsonage built in 1964. This church remains today the center of all activity for Trinity Parish. A very short distance to the north of the church building is Fostertown Cemetery, which is maintained by the church. The history of Methodism in Newburgh dates back to 1786 when the Reverend Ezekiel Cooper came to preach at the invitation of Mrs. Arthur Smith, still known to this day as &quot;The Mother of Methodism&quot; in Newburgh. The first Methodist Church in Middle Hope was built in 1822 and was known as the Asbury Chapel. In 1885, the church moved three miles to the north to a building originally built by Presbyterians, and in 1965 moved to Carter Avenue, where the congregation remained until the merger eleven years later. The Rossville Church, built in 1831, is still standing and is now the site of the Rossville Memorial Library.
*Union Grove – also no longer exists. It was a rural hamlet near the junction of Routes 17K and 300 (formerly known as Union Avenue). Today it is wholly commercial. The former Fleet Bank Building, housing commercial offices and currently the Finkelstein and Associates law firm, is the tallest building in the town. It stands on the site of the Union Grove Elementary School, demolished in the early 1980s.
*Wedgewood Park – a development just south of Brewer Road, was planned since the early 1960s but was not finally built until the late 1980s. All of the streets are named after states (Ohio Drive, Vermont Drive, Maine Drive, etc.) The development is prominently visible from the summit of Cronomer Hill.
*Winona Lake – an area around upper and lower Winona Lake along Route 52. The upper lake dried out and became a marshland in the 1960s. The lower lake has also fallen into disrepair due to the recent failure of a man-made dam built in the 1930s. The local homeowners association is debating what action to take towards restoring the lake and is seeking governmental assistance in doing so. The &quot;Winona Lake Fire Engine Company&quot; is actually located west of the hamlet, closer to Gardnertown. For this reason some commercial maps mislabel the small lake in Algonquin Park as Winona Lake. An elementary school formerly stood on Winona Avenue. Today, this building is occupied by the Penuel Pentecostal Tabernacle.

<text>Newburgh is a city in Orange County, New York, United States. With a population of 28,856 as of the 2020 census, it is a principal city of the Kiryas Joel–Poughkeepsie–Newburgh metropolitan area. Located north of New York City, and south of Albany on the Hudson River within the Hudson Valley Area, the city of Newburgh is located near Stewart International Airport, one of the primary airports for Downstate New York.

The Newburgh area was first settled in the early 18th century by the Germans and British. During the American Revolution, Newburgh served as the headquarters of the Continental Army. Prior to its chartering in 1865, the city of Newburgh was part of the town of Newburgh; the town now borders the city to the north and west. East of the city is the Hudson River; the city of Beacon is across the river and it is connected to Newburgh via the Newburgh–Beacon Bridge. The entire southern boundary of the city is with the town of New Windsor. Most of this boundary is formed by Quassaick Creek. In May 2016, the city requested help for its PFOS contaminated water supply under Superfund.

Newburgh is the location of numerous preserved landmarks, including Washington&#x27;s Headquarters, the David Crawford House, New York State Armory, the Dutch Reformed Church, and Newburgh Colored Burial Ground. George Washington and Franklin Delano Roosevelt had ties to the city; Ulysses S. Grant, Robert F. Kennedy, and Theodore Roosevelt also visited, the latter delivering a famous speech at a nearby shipyard. The city served as a planning ground for the Gothic Revival architectural movement in America, headed by native Andrew Jackson Downing with English architects Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers.

Mount Saint Mary College is a private liberal arts college located here.

== History ==
At the time of European contact the area of Newburgh was occupied by the Waoranek, a branch of the Lenape. The area that became Newburgh was first explored by Europeans when Henry Hudson stopped by during his 1609 expedition up the river that now bears his name. His navigator, Robert Juet, is said to have called the site &quot;a pleasant place to build a town&quot;, although some later historians believe he may actually have been referring to the area where Cornwall-on-Hudson now stands.

Around 1683, provincial governor Thomas Dongan purchased the land from the Woaranek people. The first settlement was made in the spring of 1709 by fifty-four Palatine refugees, sponsored by Queen Anne of Great Britain. The settlers named it the Palatine Parish by Quassic. In 1743, a ferry at the foot of First Street had been established between Newburgh and Fishkill Landing (now Beacon, New York). In 1752, the land had been surveyed by Cadwallader Colden and named &quot;Newburgh&quot;, perhaps after one of the Newburghs (there are two) in his father&#x27;s native Scotland (Colden himself was born in Ireland). Shipyards were established and docks and warehouses lined the waterfront.

In April 1782, General George Washington made his headquarters at the farmhouse of the Hasbrouck family, making Newburgh the Continental Army&#x27;s headquarters; he remained there until August 1783. This was Washington&#x27;s longest stay at any of his over 160 headquarters. In March 1782, Washington received the famous Newburgh letter from Lewis Nicola, suggesting that he declare himself king of the United States, a suggestion he strongly rejected. In honor of that rejection, Kings Highway, the north–south street on which the Newburgh headquarters is located, was renamed Liberty Street. In March 1783, feeling embittered over their lack of payment from Congress, an anonymous letter circulated amongst the senior officers encamped at the nearby New Windsor Cantonment, calling for a meeting between the officers to decide what course of action to take against Congress; the letter advocated for an ultimatum stating that if peace was declared and the officers were still unpaid, they would refuse to disband the army — effectively a military mutiny against the civilian government. This letter began what is now known as the &quot;Newburgh Conspiracy&quot;. After delivering the &quot;Newburgh Address&quot; and reading aloud a letter from Congressman Joseph Jones of Virginia, Washington was able to persuade his officers to stay loyal to Congress and to him. A month later, Washington delivered the &quot;Proclamation of the Cessation of Hostilities&quot; that announced the preliminary peace treaty with the United Kingdom, and ordering the army to officially stand down. This marked the effective end of the fighting of the American Revolution, exactly 8 years later to the day since the fighting began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The Hasbrouck House was purchased by New York State in 1850 to preserve the site, making it the very first publicly owned historic site in the United States.

=== Growth ===
In 1793, Newburgh&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Newburgh Packet&quot;, was established. The hamlet of Newburgh was incorporated as a village in 1800. At the time of its settlement it was in Ulster County and was that county&#x27;s seat. When Rockland County was split from Orange County in 1798, Newburgh and the other towns north of Moodna Creek were put in a redrawn Orange County. Newburgh thus lost its status as the county seat to Goshen, but as a political compromise supreme court sessions continued to be heard in Newburgh as well as the county seat of Goshen, the only place in New York State this is permitted. Although technically still permitted by statute, this practice was discontinued in the mid-1960s. The former County courthouse still stands as Newburgh&#x27;s old city courthouse building (currently used as municipal office space).

By 1793 there were four sloop lines operating out of Newburgh. As new turnpikes opened trade extended into the interior, passenger coaches and farm wagons raveled as far west as Canandaigua. This was the shortest route from the Hudson to Western New York. By 1819 a steamboat on Cayuga Lake connected Newburgh stage lines with Ithaca. Streets leading to the river were often blocked for hours with farmers&#x27; wagons waiting to be unloaded at the wharves. With the opening of the Erie Canal much of the traffic from the Southern Tier was diverted. In 1830 Richard Carpenter of Newburgh had the steamboat &quot;William Young&quot; built at Low Point; it ran between Newburgh and Albany. Prosperity returned with the arrival of the railroads.

On the evening of September 24, 1824, beacon fires in the Hudson Highlands announced the arrival of the Marquis de Lafayette. Having been feted in New York, he sailed upriver on the chartered steamer &quot;James Kent&quot;. The next day, people came from the surrounding towns to catch a glimpse of the general as he made his way to a reception at the Orange Hotel. The Rev. John Brown of St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church was part of the welcoming committee. At 2 am., Lafayette sailed from Reeve &amp; Falls dock for Poughkeepsie.

The Erie Railroad charter was amended April 8, 1845, to allow the building of the Newburgh Branch, running from the main line near Greycourt northeast to Newburgh, also on the Hudson River. The branch opened January 8, 1850. It was later used as a connection to the New York and New England Railroad via a car float operation across the river to Beacon, New York.

Newburgh was chartered as a city in April 1865.

Newburgh became quite prosperous during the Gilded Age that followed. Newburgh had telephone service in 1879. In 1883 there was a steamboat landing on Second Street. The United States Hotel was on Front Street opposite the landing. Also on Front Street near the landing was the Union Depot. In 1883, the West Shore Railroad inaugurated service to the Pennsylvania Railroad Depot at Jersey City and by 1886 was traveling to Weehawken Terminal, where passengers transferred to ferries to Manhattan.

With its situation on the Hudson River, midway between New York City and Albany, it became a transportation hub and an industrial center. Its industries included the manufacturing of cottons, woolens, silks, paper, felt hats, baking powder, soap, paper boxes, brick, plush goods, steam boilers, tools, automobiles, coin silver, bleach, candles, waterway gates, ice machines, pumps, moving-picture screens, overalls, perfumes, furniture, carpets, carburetors, spiral springs, spiral pipe, shirt waists, shirts, felt goods, lawn mowers; shipyards; foundries and machine shops; tanneries; leatherette works; and plaster works.

J. J. Nutt said of Newburgh:

Newburgh was home to the second Edison power plant, which installed and powered 126 lamps at the Orange Woolen Mill, and was the second American city (after New York&#x27;s Pearl Street) to have a street lit using electricity. Broadway, which at in width is one of the widest streets in the state of New York, runs through the city culminating with views of the Hudson River.

=== 20th and 21st centuries === 
Newburgh played a pivotal role in television history. In October 1939, RCA chose to test-market televisions in Newburgh, which was within range of the television signal of RCA&#x27;s experimental station W2XBS. Six hundred sets were sold in Newburgh at a deep discount. The test-marketing campaign&#x27;s success encouraged RCA to go forward with developing the new medium. Additionally, with consumer television production ceasing during World War II, those Newburgh households which purchased televisions during 1939 and 1940 were among the few to enjoy television (albeit with a greatly reduced programming schedule) during the war.

Newburgh was one of the first cities in the country to fluoridate its water in 1945.

In the late 20th century the industrial base of the city declined as industries relocated operations south or to other locations with cheaper labor costs and lower taxes. The Hudson River, which previously served as the main means of transporting goods, lost much of its shipping traffic to trucking. The city&#x27;s trolley system was shut down in 1924 in favor of buses. The nation moved to the automobile for transportation and, as with many other cities, there was a resulting migration to the suburbs. In 1963 the Newburgh–Beacon Bridge was opened, carrying Interstate 84 and spanning the Hudson River, bypassing the Newburgh waterfront and the city of Newburgh altogether. The ferry closed down soon thereafter—it was not revived until 2005—and the waterfront area declined rapidly.

In 1962, Lloyd&#x27;s Department Store became the first major shopping center in Newburgh. Its motto was &quot;Years Ahead&quot;. Many features of Lloyd&#x27;s, including widely divergent ministores under one roof, did not become common in other shopping centers for many decades. Lloyd&#x27;s successfully drew a great deal of retail business away from the downtown area. In 1964, the Mid Valley Mall opened, also outside of the city limits in Newburgh, and attracted many long-established local businesses away from the waterfront and downtown city of Newburgh. Other retail shopping malls soon sprang up, all also outside the city of Newburgh, and the retail industry of the city declined further. The city continued to lose its previously well regarded retail sector along Water Street and Broadway to the suburban shopping malls, which did not share the city&#x27;s congested parking and traffic problems or the perceived rising crime rate.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the city&#x27;s response to the economic decline was an ambitious urban renewal plan. The city&#x27;s historic waterfront area, an area composed of several square blocks which included numerous historically significant buildings, was completely demolished between 1970 and 1973. Residents were relocated, or were supposed to be relocated, to newer housing projects around Muchattoes Lake in the city&#x27;s interior.

A grand complex that was planned for the urban renewal area was never built when state and federal spending began to dry up after the 1973 oil crisis. To this day, the blocks which slope down to the river remain open, grassy slopes, offering sweeping views of the Hudson but generating no property taxes for the city. Public sentiment is mixed on whether they should be built on again at all, and the city&#x27;s view-protection ordinances make it less likely. Below, the waterfront was developed in the late 1990s after the city was once again able to secure grants from the state&#x27;s Environmental Protection fund for riprap to stabilize the shoreline.
In the early 1960s, city manager Joseph McDowell Mitchell and the council attracted nationwide attention when they attempted to require welfare recipients to pick up their payments at police headquarters. Mitchell later announced a program that would have denied welfare payments after three months except to the aged, the blind and the handicapped. After opposition by both state and federal officials, the program created a national controversy and never went into effect.

Newburgh in the early 21st century is more racially diverse than previously, with a growing Latin American immigrant population (mainly of Mexican descent) in addition to the city&#x27;s sizable African American demographic.

==Geography==

Newburgh is situated in the Northeastern United States, in Downstate New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley region. It is located within Orange County bordering the Hudson River on the west bank. The town of Newburgh borders the city to the north and west, and the town of New Windsor borders the south.

Adjacent to Newburgh, the land rises at first sharply to a bluff, where many historic structures are located, offering sweeping views of the Hudson Highlands to the south; Mount Beacon to the east and the Newburgh—Beacon Bridge to the north; then more gradually to a relatively level western half. There are some notable hills in outlying areas such as the Washington Heights section in southeast Newburgh and Mount St. Mary&#x27;s at the northeast. The lowest elevation in the city is at sea level along the river; the highest is roughly 690 feet (210 m) on Snake Hill along the city&#x27;s boundary with the town of New Windsor.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city is located at the following coordinates: (41.503193, −74.019636). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Newburgh has a total area of , of which is land and (20.08%) is water. Newburgh makes up a part of the Kiryas Joel-Poughkeepsie-Newburgh metropolitan area, which is a part of the larger New York metropolitan area.

Despite progress from the early 1990s, poverty remained a significant problem. The 2000 census found that two of the city&#x27;s five census tracts were among the poorest in the entire state. In 2004 the state declared it one of the state&#x27;s five most &quot;stressed&quot; cities, based on a mix of statistics like families headed by single mothers, abandoned buildings, unemployment, residents under the poverty line and adults without a high school diploma.

=== Religion ===

According to &quot;Sperling&#x27;s BestPlaces&quot;, 53.5% of Newburghers are religious.

==== St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church ====
In 1728 the Rev. Richard Charlton was sent from England to be a missionary to the people of New Windsor in then Ulster County (later Newburgh in Orange County). St. George&#x27;s Church developed from St. Thomas&#x27; Church in New Windsor. In 1770, during the tenure of the Rev. John Sayre, St. George&#x27;s Church was granted a royal charter by King George III. The Rev. Mr. Sayres left for Canada at the time of the Revolution. In 1790 Rev George Spierin served as both minister and schoolmaster, but resigned in 1793. St. George&#x27;s Church was re-established in 1805. In 1838 the Rev Dr. John Brown organized St. George&#x27;s Cemetery, open to members of any race, religion or belief. He was also a founder of St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital. Originally, services were held in the old Glebe schoolhouse until the church was built in 1819. In 1834 the bell tower was added. Dr. Brown was succeeded by his assistant, Rev. Octavius Applegate who founded the mission chapel, of the Good Shepherd.

==== St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church ====
The first Catholic service in Newburgh took place around 1816 when Mass was said in the house of Henry Gilmore on Western Avenue (now Broadway) by Rev. James McKenna. He was followed in 1817 by Rev. Ffrench. A church was formed in 1826, served by circuit-riding missionaries. Rev. Philip O&#x27;Reilly made Newburgh the base from which he served other communities. St. Patrick&#x27;s Church was founded in 1836. Fr. Patrick Duffy was the first pastor and served for seventeen years until his death in 1853. He was followed by Rev. Gallagher, who was succeeded by Rev. Edward J. O&#x27;Reilly. Father O&#x27;Reilly was followed by Father Broidy. 
A stone church building was completed in December 1842 and formally dedicated by Bishop John Hughes of New York in 1849. In 1852 land was purchased for a cemetery at the corner of First and Stone streets. The rectory was built in 1854. The parish established in 1855 a Library Association, later known as the Young Men&#x27;s Catholic Lyceum. In 1881 a new building was erected for the Lyceum on Liberty St.

In 1879 Right Rev. Monsignor J.F. Mooney became pastor and started the mission of St. Joseph&#x27;s in New Windsor. He also founded Calvary Cemetery which opened on May 30, 1898.

St. Patrick&#x27;s began its Hispanic ministry in the mid-1960s. In 1966 Father John Filippelli of the Society of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart initiated a Spanish Mass as well as cultural celebrations such as the Feast of Three Kings. In 1973, Fr. Rogelio Cuesta, OP was named Director of the Hispanic Apostolate of Newburgh and Beacon. Other patronal feasts were celebrated such as Our Lady of Charity from Cuba, Señor de los Milagros of Peru, and Our Lady of Suyapa of Honduras, reflecting the diversity of the community. In 1989 the ministry was expanded to include outreach to migrant workers.

==== St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church ====
St. Mary&#x27;s Church was founded in 1875, when the archbishop, John McCloskey divided the original parish creating Mary&#x27;s parish in the northern part. The first mass in the parish was on Easter Sunday, 1875, in the opera-house. In 1880 the building occupied by the church until 2015 was erected at Gidney Avenue and South Street. 
In 1883 Mount Saint Mary College was founded. In 1884 St. Mary&#x27;s Parochial School opened on September 1, 1886.

St. Mary&#x27;s Parish was merged with St. Patrick&#x27;s effective August 1, 2015. The church building was shuttered and closed and has not been used since that date.

=== Crime ===
Newburgh was ranked more dangerous than 95 percent of US cities by website &quot;NeighborhoodScout&quot;, based on 2012 FBI crime data. This group also ranked Newburgh as the tenth most dangerous place to live in the United States based on the same 2012 dataset. It was ranked at number 12 in the previous year&#x27;s rankings.

In 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote an extensive article on gang activity in Newburgh.

In 2014, Newburgh began implementing a program called &quot;Group Violence Intervention,&quot; an example of focused deterrence. In 2017, Newburgh reported the lowest crime rates in 10 years.

==Economy==
Newburgh was once a major economic hub between New York City and the New York State capital of Albany. Partly due to suburbanization and other economic factors the city suffered an economic decline from the 1960s to first quarter of the 21st century. Currently over 11,400 residents are employed within the city limits.

The largest industries as of 2020 were retail, healthcare and social assistance, food services, finance, public administration, and educational services.

==Arts and culture==
===Preservation===
Newburgh&#x27;s preservation history can be traced all the way back to 1850 when Washington&#x27;s Headquarters was designated a state historic site, the first in the country. The Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands was chartered by the State of New York and incorporated in 1884. The David Crawford House on Montgomery Street, built in 1830, is the current home of the Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands.

The city&#x27;s modern preservation efforts began when the Dutch Reformed Church, a Greek Revival structure designed by Alexander Jackson Davis, was slated for demolition as part of urban renewal after the congregation left the building in 1967. The movement to stop it led to the development of a historic district, now the second largest in New York State. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places three years later, and in 2001 became the city&#x27;s second National Historic Landmark after Washington&#x27;s Headquarters.

The city was designated a Preserve America community in 2005 and it also signed an agreement with the State Office of Historic Preservation as a Certified Local Government community. Its East End Historic District, recognized by the National Register of Historic Places as that and the Montgomery-Grand-Liberty Streets Historic District, has the most contributing properties of any historic district in the state.

The city&#x27;s historic architecture, featuring designs by Alexander Jackson Davis, Calvert Vaux, Andrew Jackson Downing, Frederick Clarke Withers, George E. Harney, John H. Duncan, J. A. Wood, Warren and Wetmore, James Riely Gordon, and McKim, Mead &amp; White have attracted a stable core of preservation-minded community activists willing to invest, spend time, and money in renovating property. Other notable native architects include Thornton MacNess Niven, ancestor of playwright Thornton Wilder, Elkanah K. Shaw, and Frank E. Estabrook, known for his civic buildings.

=== Public historical sites ===

* Old Town Cemetery — The city&#x27;s first burying ground and religious site, with gravestones dating to the mid 18th century. Features a unique Egyptian Revival tomb thought to be designed by Davis. 
* Newburgh Colored Burial Ground — Former site of a Black cemetery, destroyed around the turn of the 20th century. Construction in a parking lot prompted an archeological dig, which revealed possibly hundreds of remains. 
* St. George&#x27;s Cemetery — An early planned rural cemetery situated in the city&#x27;s East End, with several notable interments. Maintained by St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church, the oldest continually-operating church in the city.
* Washington&#x27;s Headquarters State Historic Site — Headquarters of George Washington during the end of the Revolutionary War, and home of the Huguenot Hasbrouck family. It is the first publicly owned historic site in the United States. 
* David Crawford House — Headquarters of the Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands, who use the house as a museum and library. Built by David Crawford, a freighter and merchant who contributed to the development of the city. 
* Downing Park — A Vaux-Olmstead-designed public park given to the memory of Downing. Features pathways similar to Central Park, with a small pond, cafe, amphitheatre, and pergola designed by Estabrook on the foundation of an 18th-century farmhouse.

==Sports==

The Hudson Valley Renegades are a minor league baseball team affiliated with the New York Yankees. The team is a member of the New York–Penn League, and play at Dutchess Stadium in nearby Fishkill.

The Hudson Valley Highlanders of the North American Football League played their home games at Dietz Stadium in nearby Kingston.

== Government ==
Newburgh has seven elected officials, a mayor and six city council members, four elected by ward to four-year terms, staggered so that the mayor and two at-large councilmembers are up for re-election one year and four others, by ward, two years later. It was anticipated that in November 2007, Newburgh voters would decide on whether to split Newburgh into eight wards and elect one councilmember from each ward. The Newburgh City Council voted to disallow this referendum from appearing on the ballot pending further public input.

In 1915 it became one of the first American cities to delegate routine governmental authority to a city manager. The mayor accepts all legal process and often serves as the symbolic head of the city, but other than that has no special powers or role. The city manager, who appoints all other city officials subject to council approval, serves at their pleasure. Since the position was created, there have been 33 managers who have served an average tenure of 2.7 years, with John Fogarty holding the longevity record at eight years in the 1950s. His term ended with his dismissal, as did eight others.

In January 2009, Jean Anne McGrane, the first woman to hold the position, was fired for, among other issues, withholding an unfavorable federal report on the city&#x27;s mishandling of two HUD grants from the city council in the midst of the consideration of a $6 million bond, the 2009 city budget and the 2009 CDBG funds.

The city has had five mayors and eight city managers (five if two who served twice are counted only once) since 2000. Two subsequent acting city managers, after McGrane, quit. Richard Herbek, the third acting manager, took the job months later. He resigned in 2013 amid reports that he had misrepresented an encounter with a prostitute the year before. The (former) police chief, Michael Ferrara, replaced him on an interim basis. Michael G. Ciaravino was appointed City Manager of Newburgh on May 19, 2014, by unanimous vote of the City Council.

In April 2018, Judy Kennedy, who was elected Newburgh&#x27;s mayor in 2011, died of ovarian cancer at the age of 73, leaving the office vacant until her successor Torrance Harvey was appointed the following month.

Newburgh is in the 18 Congressional District.

=== Politics ===
Tensions flared during the city&#x27;s hotly contested 1995 mayoral election. Allegations of electoral fraud had dogged the city&#x27;s first African American woman mayor, Audrey Carey, since her 1991 victory in a four-way race. Supporters of Republican candidate Regina Angelo alleged that many registered voters in neighborhoods Carey had carried heavily used false addresses. In response, four years later deputy sheriffs were stationed at polling places and challenged voters to provide proof of residency and identity. Although she won, Carey&#x27;s supporters claimed that the deputy sheriffs had singled out minority voters for such challenges, and accused the Republicans of voter suppression. These tensions were only aggravated when the council selected the city&#x27;s Republican chairman at the time, Harry Porr, as the new city manager. Carey was defeated by Tyrone Crabb, a black man running on the Republican line, in 1999. Porr was fired, rehired and fired again in 2001. Crabb died suddenly of a heart attack ten days before he was slated to take office. The vacancy was filled by his widow, Mary.

Despite demographics and urban trends favoring Democrats, the voters of the city had until recent years regularly voted across party lines. Nicholas Valentine, mayor from 2003 until 2011 and several other recent mayors and council members were Republicans. The late Thomas Kirwan—a resident who served in the New York State Assembly until 2008—and was re-elected in a successful comeback bid in 2010, by one of the smallest margins in state history (15 votes), was a Republican. He died late in 2011. On March 20, a special election was held to fill the vacancy in which former Assemblyman Frank Skartados, Democrat, won by a large margin. In the general election held in November 2011, a newcomer to the city named Judith Kennedy was overwhelmingly elected Mayor over incumbent Republican Councilwoman Christine Bello. In addition, the Democratic candidates for Council seats, Gay Lee and Cedric Brown, were also overwhelmingly elected. Accordingly, the council is now 5-0 Democrat—the first time in recorded history one party monopolizes the Newburgh city government.

An independent documentary was made in 2004 about the mayoral race in Newburgh, called &quot;Saving Newburgh&quot;.

In 2009, the Republican party did not field its own candidates for city council. Instead the Republican Committee endorsed two Democrats—one a former councilman, the other an incumbent councilwoman—and they were not opposed for the Republican nomination in the primary despite their being registered Democrats. The Conservative and Independence parties both nominated them also. They lost the Democratic primary and despite their appearing on three party lines they lost the November election to two straight Democrats, both one time Republicans.

Newburgh declared itself a sanctuary city in March 2017.

The City Council passed a ceasefire resolution in Hamas&#x27; war on Israel on January 22, 2024. 

== Education ==

In 1978, students at Newburgh Free Academy, the city&#x27;s public high school, boycotted classes. This ultimately led to a major reorganization of the school system. Newburgh is served by the Newburgh Enlarged City School District.

The local high school is called Newburgh Free Academy, and it is the largest public high school in Orange County. It serves approximately 3,000 students in grades 9–12 from the Newburgh area. Newburgh Free Academy is currently split into three campuses, with NFA Main located on Fullerton Avenue, NFA North located on Robinson Avenue a few blocks away, and NFA West located on West Street. Between the three campuses, there are roughly over 4,300 students enrolled. Two colleges are located in Newburgh, Mount Saint Mary College and the Newburgh campus of SUNY Orange.

== Media ==
Newburgh is within the media market of New York City and Middletown. It is served by &quot;The Mid Hudson Times&quot; (Newburgh-based weekly), &quot;The Times Herald-Record&quot;, &quot;The Hudson Valley Press&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;El Diario La Prensa&quot;, &quot;The New York Post&quot;, and other newspapers local to the area. Its television market features News 12 Hudson Valley, a regional television channel marketed toward the Hudson River Valley Area.

==Infrastructure==

Allegiant Air, Breeze, and Play airlines provide passenger flights Stewart International Airport, west of the city. Metro-North Railroad, at Beacon station on the opposite east shore of the Hudson River, accessible via the Newburgh–Beacon Ferry during peak hours, connects to commuter rail service on the Hudson Line, with frequent commuter rail service to Westchester County and Grand Central Terminal in New York City. There is also service on the Metro-North Railroad Port Jervis Line from nearby Salisbury Mills—Cornwall station to Hoboken Terminal and Secaucus Junction in New Jersey and connects to Penn Station in New York City. The last Albany-Weehawken trains through Newburgh left in 1958 when the New York Central ended service north of West Haverstraw on the West Shore Railroad.

&quot;The River Rose&quot; is a sight-seeing ferry on a paddlewheel style boat. While it does not offer point-to-point commuter service across the Hudson River, from May 31 to October 31 it offers local cruises. Hudson River Adventures runs sightseeing tours on its conventional style cruise &quot;Pride of the Hudson,&quot; running cruises, May to October.

Ulster County Area Transit provides limited bus service to New Paltz on its route X. Short Line, part of Coach USA, provides daily service down Route 32 to Central (Hudson) Valley and points in New Jersey and New York City. Local service is also provided within the city by Newburgh Area Transit Leprechaun Lines also provides a Newburgh-Beacon-Stewart link. Coach USA also provides transportation to other points in Orange County, including Middletown and Woodbury.

New York State Route 32 and U.S. Route 9W pass through the city. New York State Route 17K and New York State Route 207 also reach their eastern termini within city limits. Interstate 84 passes just north of the city and the New York State Thruway (I-87) not far to the west.

=== Public safety ===
==== Police ====
Newburgh&#x27;s early police department consisted of twenty-two officers. On April 6, 1869, the Newburgh Police Department was authorized with regulations by the Common Council Ordinance. The first headquarters of the department was on First Street between Montgomery and Smith Street. Its current headquarters is located on both Broadway and Grand Street.

==== Fire ====
Newburgh&#x27;s Fire Department operates out of two citywide firehouses. The department runs a frontline apparatus fleet of four engine companies (including two reserve engines), two ladder companies (including one reserve ladder), one fire boat, one fire alarm truck, and seven support units. It also houses and runs one of the Orange County Technical Rescue trailers as well as a foam trailer as part of the NYS Foam Task Force.

In 1934 the earlier volunteer companies were replaced by a professional department.

===Hospitals===
The city&#x27;s economy is also stimulated by several hospitals and medical institutions including Montefiore St. Lukes Cornwall Hospital, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) and Hudson Valley Healthcare System.

===Water supply===
In May 2016, the city requested help for its PFOS contaminated water supply under Superfund; The source of the contamination was foam used during firefighting drills held by the Stewart Air National Guard Fire Department. Representative Sean Patrick Maloney demanded emergency action after EPA announced PFOA and PFOS Standards for Drinking Water, and called Stewart Air National Guard Base being &quot;the most likely source&quot; of contamination.

<text>Warwick is a village in Orange County, New York, United States, in the southeastern section of the town of Warwick. The village&#x27;s population was 6,652 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.

== History ==

Settled in the middle part of the 18th Century, the village grew from its agricultural roots as a stopover on the King&#x27;s Highway between Philadelphia and Newburgh, New York. During the American War for Independence, British General Burgoyne and his army camped on the outskirts of the village after their defeat at the Battle of Saratoga. Also during the American Revolution, Martha Washington stayed at Baird&#x27;s Tavern, now located on Main Street in the Village.

In 1859, Grinnell Burt along with other local businessmen met to form a new rail line from the Erie Railroad&#x27;s main line at Greycourt to the village as a means of transporting milk and other agricultural products to market. The Warwick Valley Railroad was chartered on March 8, 1860, and the line was completed in 1862 functioning essentially as a 10-mile long branch of the 6-foot gauge Erie. Almost all of the commercial brick buildings in the village date to this period including the Dispatch Building and Demerest Hotel which were built to house passengers from the trains. When the line was extended to Belvidere, then to Allentown, the Warwick Valley Railroad was merged into the Lehigh and Hudson River Railway in 1882 with Warwick serving as the headquarters for the 90+ mile line for its entire history. The railyard first established at the South Street terminus was replaced first with a roundhouse and machine shop at Elm Street, then in 1910 with a full complex off of River Street (the present site of Jones Chemical). The L&amp;HR served as a major &quot;bridge line&quot; of freight traffic between Pennsylvania and the enormous railyard at Maybrook, New York where freight would be forward to New England over the vitally important Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge. With the advent of the age of the automobile, the small passenger business that existed dried up and the last passenger train was run between Warwick and Greycourt on July 8, 1939. The L&amp;HR was the largest single employer in the village of Warwick, but with the decline of rail and the burning of the Poughkeepsie Bridge in May 1974, the L&amp;HR was deemed irrelevant and the bankrupt railroad was folded into Conrail in 1976.

Without any link to a major highway, Warwick avoided the rapid development of other town in Orange County at the beginning of the 21st Century and maintains its small town charm to this day. along Routes 94 and 17A in the center of the village are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Warwick Village Historic District. Buildings there range from the oldest in the village, the 1764 Shingle House, preserved and maintained by the Historical Society of the Town of Warwick, also known as the Warwick Historical Society, to large early 20th-century cottages built by weekend vacationers from New York City.

<text>Warwick is a town in the southwestern part of Orange County, New York, United States. Its population was 32,027 at the 2020 census. The town contains three villages (Florida, Greenwood Lake, and Warwick) and eight hamlets (Amity, Bellvale, Edenville, Little York, Wisner, New Milford, Pine Island, and Sterling Forest).

==History==

In the early 1700s, one of the original patent holders, Benjamin Aske, named his land &quot;Warwick&quot;, presumably after an area of England near his original ancestral home. He began to sell it off to settlers in 1719. His first parcel of land, 100 acres, was sold to Lawrence Decker. Other familiar family names of the Valley appeared in subsequent years. The European population of the valley grew rapidly from 1730 to 1765, and the previously existing populations of indigenous native people declined as forests and land were cleared for pasture and were re-organized. By the start of the American Revolution, almost all of the native population had disappeared in various ways. The region has been referred to as Warwick since the early eighteenth century, but a governmental form for a town named Warwick was officially created in 1788.

During the American War for Independence, Warwick was the site of a Continental Army encampment. The Hudson River Chain was forged at Sterling Iron Works in Warwick, preventing the British Navy from sailing up the Hudson River. In 1783, George Washington traveled through Warwick, stopping at Baird&#x27;s Tavern and spending the night in the home of John Hathorn.
Warwick is situated along a freight rail line, which, as it did with many other towns in Orange County (such as Goshen, Middletown, and Newburgh), contributed to the growth of the area. The nineteenth-century writer and naturalist Henry William Herbert, writing as Frank Forrester, popularized the area with his 1845 book, &quot;The Warwick Woodlands&quot;. Today, the town of Warwick is a rural community with many agricultural pursuits that stimulate its economy.

==Geography==

The town of Warwick comprises much of the southern tip of Orange County. It borders the townships of Vernon and West Milford to the south, both in the state of New Jersey. To its north, Warwick is bordered by Chester via Sugar Loaf, Orange County&#x27;s oldest hamlet, antedating both Warwick and Chester, and which was part of Warwick until the mid-nineteenth century. To its east, Warwick is bordered by the town of Tuxedo, home of the New York Renaissance Faire, and the hamlet of Tuxedo Park.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town is the second largest township in New York State and has a total area of 104.9 square miles (271.6 km2), of which 101.7 square miles (263.3 km2) is land and 3.2 square miles (8.3 km2) (3.04%) is water. Greenwood Lake is Orange County&#x27;s largest lake, and it is bisected by the border between New Jersey (to the south) and New York (on its north). Glenmere Lake, an extremely critical endangered species habitat, is bisected by Warwick and Chester.

Warwick is served by Warwick Municipal Airport and two regional state highways, New York State Route 17A (NY 17A) and NY 94. The Appalachian Trail passes through Warwick, which has been designated an Appalachian Trail Community.
