<text>Jack Earle Haley (born July 14, 1961) is an American actor and director. His earliest roles included Moocher in &quot;Breaking Away&quot; (1979) and Kelly Leak in &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; (1976), &quot;The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Bad News Bears Go to Japan&quot; (1978). After spending many years as a producer and director of television commercials, he revived his acting career with a supporting role in &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (2006). This was followed by his performance in &quot;Little Children&quot; (2006), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

His subsequent notable roles include the superhero Rorschach in &quot;Watchmen&quot; (2009), horror icon Freddy Krueger in the remake of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (2010), and Grewishka, a cyborg criminal in &quot;&quot; (2019). He played Odin Quincannon in the first season (2016) of &quot;Preacher&quot; and The Terror in the first season (2016–18) of &quot;The Tick&quot;.

==Early life==
Haley was born and raised in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles, the son of Haven Earle &quot;Bud&quot; Haley, a radio show host/disc jockey and actor, and Iris D. Douglas.

==Career==
Haley’s first role came at age five, when he was cast as the voice of Dennis the Menace in a series of animated commercials. He reprised the role of Dennis in two episodes of &quot;Curiosity Shop&quot;, his earliest known role in a television series.

Haley has appeared in numerous films, including John Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;, &quot;Damnation Alley&quot;, and &quot;Losin&#x27; It&quot;, as well as guest roles on TV. A well-known child actor, he starred as Kelly Leak in the comedy &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot;, as well as the sequels &quot;The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training&quot; and &quot;The Bad News Bears Go to Japan&quot;.

He played Moocher in Peter Yates&#x27;s acclaimed 1979 film &quot;Breaking Away&quot; and later in the short-lived TV series of the same name. Throughout the 1970s, he often played tough, angry, pimply, long-haired misfits; although in his feature debut, the offbeat 1972 film &quot;The Outside Man&quot;, he played Eric, a boy so desperately lonely that he tries to impress the mob assassin holding him and his mother (Georgia Engel) hostage. Haley also shot a pilot for an American version of the popular British comedy &quot;The Young Ones&quot; titled &quot;Oh, No! Not THEM!&quot;. In 1974 he played Norm, a misfit kid, in the 12th episode of the Saturday morning children&#x27;s show &quot;Shazam!&quot; 

Haley&#x27;s acting career went dormant during most of the 1990s and early 2000s, when he moved to San Antonio. He eventually turned to directing, finding success as a producer and director of television commercials.

With the recommendation of Sean Penn, Haley returned to acting in 2006, first appearing in Steven Zaillian&#x27;s &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; alongside Penn as Sugar Boy, his bodyguard, before giving a critically acclaimed performance as a recently paroled sex offender in Todd Field&#x27;s &quot;Little Children&quot;. He stated that his preparation for the role was greatly influenced by the relationship shared between his mother and his brother True, who battled a heroin addiction before he died of an overdose. Haley was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this portrayal and in 2007 was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Haley owns a production company, JEH Productions, in San Antonio. In 2008, he appeared in &quot;Semi-Pro&quot; and starred in &quot;Winged Creatures&quot; with Kate Beckinsale, Guy Pearce and Dakota Fanning. He also stars in Zack Snyder&#x27;s 2009 adaptation of the Alan Moore graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot; as Rorschach, a masked vigilante working to find the identity of a costumed hero killer, a role which earned him praise from many reviewers. The film also reunited him with &quot;Little Children&quot; co-star Patrick Wilson who played Nite Owl II, Rorschach&#x27;s former partner. Also in 2010, Haley appeared in &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese, as a patient of a hospital for the criminally insane.

In 2010, Haley played Freddy Krueger in the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; remake. He signed to play the role in a sequel, which was not produced.

Haley has dismissed rumors that he accompanied Johnny Depp to auditions for Wes Craven&#x27;s original &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984) to audition for the role Depp was eventually cast in. Haley auditioned for the role of the film&#x27;s antagonist, Freddy Krueger, but ended up losing out to Robert Englund for the 1984 version of the film.

Haley was a series regular on &quot;Human Target&quot; as Guerrero, an ally of the main character, Christopher Chance. The series premiered on January 17, 2010 on Fox, and ran for two seasons before being cancelled in May 2011.

He played Willie Loomis in the 2012 film adaptation of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, directed by Tim Burton, and played Confederate States Vice President Alexander H. Stephens in &quot;Lincoln&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg. He played the supervillain &quot;The Terror&quot; in Amazon&#x27;s re-boot of &quot;The Tick&quot;.

==Personal life==
Haley&#x27;s first marriage was to Sherry Vaughan in 1979. He has two children: a son, Christopher (born 1986), and a daughter, Olivia (born 1998), by his second wife, Jennifer Haley. He married his third wife, Amelia Cruz, in 2004 and they live in San Antonio. Haley holds black belts in Kenpo and Taekwondo.

<doc id="255815" wikidata="Q4966924" url="?curid=255815" title="Bridgwater Bay">
<text>Bridgwater Bay is on the Bristol Channel, north of Bridgwater in Somerset, England at the mouth of the River Parrett and the end of the River Parrett Trail. It stretches from Minehead at the southwestern end of the bay to Brean Down in the north. The area consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, some of which are vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) covering an area of since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.

Several rivers, including the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain into the bay. Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels, including the River Huntspill, also run into the bay. The mud flats provide a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for overwintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including Eurasian whimbrel (&quot;Numenius phaeopus&quot;), black-tailed godwit (&quot;Limosa limosa&quot;), dunlin (&quot;Calidris alpina&quot;) and wigeon (&quot;Anas penelope&quot;). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed wooden structures for hundreds of years. It was also the last site in England used for &#x27;mudhorse fishing&#x27;. There are several small harbours along the coast.

The low-lying areas of the bay have been subject to flooding, including the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 and many times since particularly around the Steart Peninsula. In response to this threat sea walls have been built at several points including at Burnham-on-Sea, Berrow and Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast. The extensive mud flats and high tidal range have been the cause of several drownings and rescue services are now provided by the Burnham Area Rescue Boat.

==Geography==
Bridgwater Bay forms a portion of the coastline of Somerset on the southern side of the Bristol Channel stretching from the Quantock Hills at the south western end to Brean Down at the northern end. Around the coastline is a wave-cut platform of Jurassic Blue Lias. Several rivers flow into the bay, the main ones being the Parrett, Brue and Washford, along with the man-made River Huntspill. Major features and settlements along the coastline, running from north east to south west, include: Brean, Berrow, Burnham on Sea, the mouth of the River Parrett, the Steart Peninsula, Lilstock, East Quantoxhead and Watchet. Sand dunes at Berrow and a shingle ridge at Steart have been created by winds blowing from the west. On the beach near Stogursey are the remains of a submerged forest dated to 2500 BC. - 6500 BC.
Brean Down is a promontory marking the eastern end of the bay. Made of carboniferous limestone, it is a continuation of the Mendip Hills, and two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. It is owned by the National Trust, and is rich in wildlife, history and archaeology, as well as being a Site of Special Scientific Interest in its own right. It is bounded by steep cliffs and, at its seaward point, Brean Down Fort built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War. There is evidence of an Iron Age hill fort, prehistoric barrows, field systems and a pagan shrine. The shrine dating from pre-Roman times was re-established as a Romano-Celtic style temple in the mid-4th century and probably succeeded by a small late-4th century Christian oratory. In 1897, following wireless transmissions from Lavernock Point in Wales to Flat Holm, Guglielmo Marconi moved his equipment to Brean Down and set a new distance record for wireless transmission.

At low tide large parts of the bay become mud flats wide, due to the tidal range of , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The intertidal mud flats are, as a result, potentially dangerous and it is not uncommon for the emergency services to mount rescue operations on them. Following the death of Lelaina Hall off Berrow in 2002, a local fund raising campaign succeeded in purchasing a Swedish-built BBV6 rescue hovercraft. The hovercraft is operated by Burnham Area Rescue Boat (BARB) in Burnham-on-Sea. Much of the coastline within the western part of the reserve is accessible via a waymarked public footpath, and the South West Coast Path begins at Minehead at the western end of the bay. The tidal range holds potential for energy generation and plans for a tidal barrage in the bay have been considered.

Hinkley Point is a headland extending into Bridgwater Bay west of Burnham-on-Sea, close to the mouth of the River Parrett. The landscape of Hinkley Point is dominated by two nuclear power stations: Hinkley Point A - Magnox (now closed) and Hinkley Point B - AGR. A third, twin-unit European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) reactor is planned, and will become Hinkley Point C.

Man-made sea defenses include a sea wall at Burnham-on-Sea and a section south from Brean Down. There are also sand dune belts which are managed for their protective function and as a wildlife habitat. There are some concerns that the proposed Severn Barrage could leave some sites high and dry, and others permanently under water. The Steart Peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, sea level rise and wave action had made some of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure. As a result, in 2002 The Environment Agency produced the Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study to examine options for the future.

The foreshore at Watchet, which lies at the mouth of the Washford River, and on the edge of Exmoor National Park, is rocky, but has a small harbour. The cliffs between Watchet and Blue Anchor show a distinct pale, greenish blue colour, resulting from the coloured alabaster found there. The name &quot;Watchet&quot; or &quot;Watchet Blue&quot; was used in the 16th century to denote this colour.

East Quantoxhead used to have a small harbour which brought in limestone for local limekilns and exported alabaster. It is thought that it was also used for smuggling.

At Kilve are the remains of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was discovered that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.

==Fishing==

The intertidal mud flats of the bay have a long history of use for fishing, with structures on Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for &#x27;mudhorse fishing&#x27; in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, prawns, sea bass, and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for fishing in the bay, along with associated artefacts.

==Ecology==

At low tide extensive areas of mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and overwintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce species can be found in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a national nature reserve, and is managed by Natural England. Some of the potential risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.

Brean Down, Berrow Dunes and Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) are included in the national nature reserve which is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. It is also a Nature Conservation Review Grade 1* site, meaning it is included in Derek Ratcliffe&#x27;s book listing the most important places for nature conservation in Great Britain.

===Flora===
Common cord-grass (&quot;Spartina anglica&quot;) was planted in the area in the 1990s. It can now be found on surrounding marshes where it has invaded the fronting mudflats. The &quot;Spartina&quot; is generally shorter in the bay than at other sites due to the high tides and the turbidity of the water, reaching around as opposed to elsewhere. On higher ground common saltmarsh-grass (&quot;Puccinellia maritima&quot;) can be found along with sea aster (&quot;Aster tripolium&quot;). Where the land is ungrazed, common reed (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;) often forms a zone above the sea aster. Where the upper marsh is grazed by cattle red fescue (&quot;Festuca rubra&quot;) and creeping bent (&quot;Agrostis stolonifera&quot;) are found. The area of marsh furthest from the sea supports Sea couch (&quot;Agropyron pungens&quot;) and sea club-rush (&quot;Scirpus maritimus&quot;).

The nationally scarce bulbous foxtail (&quot;Alopecurus bulbosus&quot;), slender hare&#x27;s-ear (&quot;Bupleurum tenuissimum&quot;) and sea barley (&quot;Hordeum marinum&quot;) are grazed by sheep on the marshes around the bay. Around Stert Island the nationally rare compact brome (&quot;Bromus madritensis&quot;) and nationally scarce Ray&#x27;s knotgrass (&quot;Polygonum oxyspermum&quot;) can be found.

The ditches are populated with aquatic and bankside plant species. These include the nationally restricted rootless duckweed (&quot;Wolffia arrhiza&quot;). Other uncommon species such as frogbit (&quot;Hydrocharis morsus-ranae&quot;) and water fern (&quot;Azolla filiculoides&quot;) can also be found. The nationally restricted brackish water-crowfoot (&quot;Ranunculus baudotii&quot;) and sea clubrush (&quot;Scirpus maritimus&quot;) indicate the slightly brackish nature of the water.

Brean Down is a site for the nationally rare white rock-rose (&quot;Helianthemum apenninum&quot;), which occurs in abundance on the upper reaches of the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (&quot;Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae&quot;), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (&quot;Orobanche hederae&quot;) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.

===Fauna===
Five Red Data Book invertebrate species have been recorded in the area. These include: soldier flies &quot;Odontomyia ornata&quot; and &quot;Stratiomys singularior&quot;, hover fly &quot;Lejops vittata&quot;, the great silver water beetle (&quot;Hydrophilus piceus&quot;), and the water beetle &quot;Hydrovatus clypealis&quot;. Nationally scarce species include the aquatic snail &quot;Gyraulus laevis&quot;, the hairy dragonfly (&quot;Brachytron pratense&quot;), and the ladybird &quot;Coccidula scutellata&quot;.

Over 190 species of birds have been identified near the bay, some of which use it as a feeding ground during their migrations. Waders and wildfowl often over-winter on the reserve. The populations of Eurasian whimbrel (&quot;Numenius phaeopus&quot;) and black-tailed godwit (&quot;Limosa limosa&quot;) are internationally important. Significant populations of dunlin (&quot;Calidris alpina&quot;) and wigeon (&quot;Anas penelope&quot;) also frequent the bay. In early winter the wigeon select &quot;Puccinellia maritima&quot; in preference to &quot;Agrostis stolonifera&quot; and &quot;Festuca rubra&quot;. Avocets have become regular autumn and winter visitors to the area in recent years, favouring the lower reaches of the River Parrett, and, for the first time in over 50 years, bred on the reserve in 2012.

Rare vagrant species spotted in the area include lesser yellowlegs, white-rumped sandpiper, Pallid Harrier (in spring) and Richard&#x27;s pipit (in autumn). The birds seen on Brean Down include peregrine falcon, western jackdaw, kestrel, collared and stock doves, common whitethroat, linnet, stonechat, dunnock and rock pipit. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.

<text>Masbate, officially the Province of Masbate (Masbateño: &quot;Probinsya san Masbate&quot;; ), is an island province in the Philippines located near the midsection of the nation&#x27;s archipelago. Its provincial capital is Masbate City, the most populous in the province. The province consists of three major islands: Masbate, Ticao and Burias.

Masbate is at the crossroads of two island groups: Visayas and Luzon. It is politically part of Bicol Region in the latter. However, from a bio-geographic and socio-ethno-linguistic perspective, Masbate is grouped in the former.

==History==
===Early history===
Masbate is one of the oldest settlements in the Philippines. Archaeological records show that Batungan (in Mandaon) and Bagumbayan (in Palanas) were major settlement sites during the Bronze Age (4000-1000 BC). The development of bronze metallurgy in South-East Asia coincided with an increasingly hierarchical society, firmly based on agricultural village settlements. It was these crucial changes, the introduction of new technologies, new social forms, and a new economic base, which culminated in the foundation of the proto-urban settlements of the 1st millennium AD. A fine stone chisel from Mount Batungan is dated to the twelfth century BC. Of the age of Philippine neoliths, it is only possible to say that polished stone adzes from Masbate have been dated from 2710 BC to AD 179.2 Kalanay (in Aroroy) was an island site from 1000 BC to AD 850 (early metal). Masbateño burial jars and a small pottery skull box found in caves dated to the beginning of the Christian era. Exquisite goldwork represents an old Philippine wealth in both an economic and an artistic sense: all sorts of wrought or molded ornaments and jewelry demonstrate both the availability of the raw material and the skill of the artisan – finger rings, earrings, head-bands, pendants, and pectoral ornaments, heavy chains with interlocking serrated edges, light filigree work, delicate necklaces of fine twisted wires, 12-millimeter beads composed of 184 separate granules soldered together, thin hammered sheets for decorating grosser objects like earplugs or the visages of corpses, and a charming little snail of unknown use. Productive mines in Benguet, Butuan, Masbate, and Paracale were in operation and gold being panned in riverbeds all over the archipelago when the Spaniards arrived.

===Spanish colonial era===
During the Spanish regime, San Jacinto in Ticao Island was an anchorage point for the Manila-Acapulco-Manila galleons. The course as described by the standard pilot&#x27;s guide of Cabrera Bueno was substantially followed by nearly all the galleons. The largest variations were in the height at which the eastward crossing was made and in the course laid off the coast of the Californias.

The successive stages were as follows: from Cavite on Manila Bay out through one of the bocas, generally between Mariveles and Corregidor; thence SSW, keeping well clear of Fortun to the left and high Ambil to the right; past Cape Santiago on the Luzon Coast, and E between Mindoro and Maricaban; by the Punta de Escarceo, or “Tide Rip Point,” where currents run strong, and under Isla Verde, outside Subaang Bay, within which there was a fair anchorage in case of need; SE past the islets of Baco, with a good channel off Calapan; SE by E down the Mindoro coast by Punta Gorda de Pola; E by SE between the Tres Reyes and the Dos Hermanas; thence by the wide bocanabetween Marinduque and Banton, out onto the tablazo, or open water, above Sibuyan; SE by E between Burias and Masbate; turning ENE around the Punta de San Miguel and the Punta del Diablo; coasting around the east side of Ticao to the anchorage at San Jacinto; clearing from thence and working out seaward with the monsoon; E right leagues, with the dangerous Naranjos to starboard and the shoal of Calantas to port; NE by N and then ENE seven leagues around Capul; NE with the Sorsogon coast to port and San Bernardino to starboard and NE by E seven leagues to the Embocadero, with San Bernardino now to port and the island of Biri to starboard. At this point, according to Cabrera, “the rapid currents require skillful pilot work.” The galleon was now in the open sea.

From the chronicles of the early years of Spanish colonization, a &quot;relacion&quot; (report) about Masbate first appeared in Fray Martin de Rada&#x27;s letter dated July 1569 to the Viceroy of New Spain (Mexico), Marquis de Falces. He mentioned that in a place called Masbat there were plenty of gold mines. Other later documents such as Artieda&#x27;s Relacion (1573) and Andres de Mirandaola&#x27;s letter (1574) refer to a place called Masbat or Masbad. It wasn&#x27;t until 1582 that Miguel de Loarca wrote about a place called Masbate.

In the same year that the Augustinian Fray de Rada wrote about Masbat&#x27;s gold mines, his fellow Augustinian Fray Alonzo Jimenez landed in Burias and baptized its chieftain Buaya. This baptism is said to be the very first baptism in Luzon. Fray Jimenez also built a church in Burias before he sailed on to Ibalon in 1570. By 1575, Masbate had become a priority in the Augustinian Missionary Memoranda. Fray Francisco de Ortega reported on the pillaging activities of a pirate named Caxabic in the islands of Masbate and Burias. By 1600, the Spaniards had developed Mobo as a galleon shipyard and San Jacinto as a strategic port. In 1605, Masbate was officially an Augustinian Mission and it is first prior was Fray Francisco Guerrero. Masbate had about 250 tributes and 1000 Christian natives. In 1609, Fray Pedro de Arce, bishop-elect of Nueva Caceres, ceded the spiritual administration of Masbate to the Mitra (secular clergy). On May 28, 1682, bishop-elect Dominican Fray Andres Gonzales petitioned the King of Spain to revert some curacies of Nueva Caceres to the charge of religious communities. The petition was approved in 1685 and by 1687, the first Augustinian Recollect missionaries had sailed for the port of San Jacinto to begin the Recollect Mission in Masbate. In 1700, Fray Ildefonso de la Concepcion established the settlement of Uson as a visita (barrio) of Mobo. The town of Masbate was established in 1791 by Fray Manuel dela Virgen del Tremedal.

The jurisdiction of Nueva Caceres embraced the entire provinces of Camarines and Albay, as far as and including the islands of Ticao, Masbate, Burias, and Catanduanes; the province of Tayabas, as far as and including Lucban; and in the opposite coast of Maobàn, to Binangonan, Polo, Baler, and Casiguran. At one time, it was governed by his very illustrious Lordship Doctor Don Ysidoro de Arevalo, who was the bishop-elect. Records show that he enjoyed a yearly stipend of 4,000 pesos of common gold, in conformance with a royal decree. Likewise, a payment was made from the royal treasury, in virtue of a decree by the supreme government and the council of the royal treasury dated October 2, 1723, 200 pesos, for priests of the choir, at 100 pesos each, as assistants of the aforesaid illustrious lord. Another payment was made of 400 pesos, assigned to this church by the royal decree, dated at San Yldefonso on August 19, 1736; for the pay of singers, sacristans, and doorkeepers, and other expenses for worship and for the [care of the] building of the church. It likewise had a contribution of 232 pesos, 4 tomins, which was paid in 6 quintals of wax, 100 gantas of coconut-oil, and 4 arrobas of Castilian wine, in conformity with another royal decree dated February 21, 1705.

The administration of Masbate was given back to the Mitra after the Recollects left Masbate in 1794. All in all, over 60 Recollect missionaries were assigned in Masbate for a period of more than 100 years. Masbate became a separate politico-military command province in 1846. In 1864, it was declared a separate province from Albay. After a devastating typhoon in 1908, Masbate was annexed to the province of Sorsogon. It finally gained status as a separate province on December 15, 1920, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 2934. In Rafael Bernal&#x27;s book: &quot;Mexico En Filipinas&quot;, Masbate was listed among other places which include Cavite and Pampanga, as areas where there were large concentrations of Mexican immigrants to the Philippines.

===20th century===
During World War II, the Japanese invaded the Philippines and turned Masbate into a hub for sexual slavery which they called &quot;the military club&quot;. A &quot;comfort station&quot; was built by the Japanese in the province, where young girls and teenagers were forced to become &quot;comfort women&quot;, and routinely gang-raped, brutalized, humiliated, and murdered by Japanese soldiers for entertainment. The Japanese occupation was resisted by local Masbateño guerrillas under Captain Manuel Donato up until April 1945 during the Allied liberation by which the guerrillas controlled much of the province.

==Geography==
The province lies roughly at the center of the Philippine archipelago, between latitudes 11°43′ north and 123°09′ east and 124°5′ east. It is bounded on the north by Burias and Ticao Pass, east by San Bernardino Strait, south by the Visayan Sea, and west by the Sibuyan Sea. Relative to mainland Bicol, the province faces the southwestern coasts of Camarines Sur, Albay, and Sorsogon areas. Masbate covers a total area of .

The general surface configuration of the province ranges from slightly undulating to rolling and from hilly to mountainous. In each island, the rugged topography is concentrated in the northeastern portion and gradually recedes to blunt hills and rolling areas in the south, southeast, and southwest.

===Administrative divisions===
Masbate comprises 20 municipalities and one city, all encompassed by 3 congressional districts.


==Demographics==
The population of Masbate in the 2020 census was 908,920 people, with a density of .

===Language===
There are four Visayan languages and one from Luzon, spoken in the province.

Masbateño or &quot;Minasbaté&quot; is a Visayan language unique to the province. It has 75-83% mutual intelligibility with Hiligaynon, another Visayan language spoken in the southwestern tip of Masbate island. Cebuano is another Visayan language spoken in the southeastern municipalities in the island. Waray is spoken in the islands of Ticao Island due to their proximity to mainland Northern Samar, especially to the southern portion parts of the Province of Sorsogon where Waray Sorsogon is spoken.

Minasbaté is spoken in Masbate City and its neighboring municipalities. 33% of the population speaks Hiligaynon and it is spoken mainly in the towns of Balud, Mandaon and the southwestern part of Milagros, while the remaining 9% speak Cebuano, mainly in the southern towns of Esperanza, Pio V. Corpus and Placer. In northeastern Burias Island they speak Bicolano, while in Ticao Island they speak Waray similarly as the people of Gubat, due to the island&#x27;s proximity to the Northern Samar mainland.

The people generally speak English and Tagalog, though these languages are rarely used in everyday discourse. The people only use them when conversing with tourists and visitors from other Philippine regions and foreign nationals.

===Religion===
Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities. Among these deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Aswang, his brother was trying to steal. Whenever people disobey his orders, wishes and commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways. Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.; Asuang, the evil god who always tries to steal the sacred fire of Mount Mayon from his brother, Gugurang. Addressed sometimes as Aswang, he dwells mainly inside Mount Malinao. As an evil god, he would cause the people to suffer misfortunes and commit sins. Enemy of Gugurang and a friend of Bulan the god of the Moon; Haliya, the masked goddess of the moonlight and the arch-enemy of Bakunawa and protector of Bulan. Her cult is composed primarily of women. There is also a ritual dance named after her as it is performed to be a counter-measure against Bakunawa.; &quot;Bulan&quot;, the god of the pale moon, he is depicted as a pubescent boy with uncommon comeliness that made savage beast and the vicious mermaids (Magindara) tame. He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang&#x27;s grip; &quot;Magindang&quot;, the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the Moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately; &quot;Okot&quot;, god of forest and hunting; and &quot;Bakunawa&quot;, a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the Sun and the Moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa&#x27;s main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.

<doc id="255818" wikidata="Q2572924" url="?curid=255818" title="Tanya (Judaism)">
<text>The Tanya () is an early work of Hasidic philosophy, by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the founder of Chabad Hasidism, first published in 1796. Its formal title is &quot;Likkutei Amarim&quot; (, Hebrew, &quot;collection of statements&quot;) but is more commonly known by its first word (&quot;tanya&quot;), which in Aramaic means &quot;it has been taught&quot;. Zalman is referring to a baraita in &quot;Niddah&quot; chapter 3 in the word’s first usage. The &quot;Tanya&quot; is composed of five sections that define Hasidic mystical psychology and theology as a handbook for daily spiritual life in Jewish observance.

The &quot;Tanya&quot; is the main work of Chabad philosophy and the Chabad approach to Hasidic mysticism, as it defines its general interpretation and method. The subsequent extensive library of the Chabad school, authored by successive leaders, builds upon the approach of the &quot;Tanya&quot;. Chabad differed from mainstream Hasidism by its philosophical investigation and intellectual analysis of Hasidic Torah exegesis. This emphasised the mind as the route to internalising Hasidic mystical &quot;dveikus&quot; (emotional fervour), in contrast to general Hasidism&#x27;s creative enthusiasm in faith. Consequently, Chabad Hasidic writings are typically characterised by their systematic intellectual structure, while other classic texts of general Hasidic mysticism are usually more compiled or anecdotal.

As one of the founding figures of Hasidic mysticism, Schneur Zalman and his approach in the &quot;Tanya&quot; are revered by some other Hasidic schools, although they tend to avoid its meditative methods. In Chabad, it is called &quot;the Written Torah of Hasidus&quot;, with the subsequent Chabad corpus being the analogical Oral Torah. In it, Zalman brings the new interpretations of Jewish mysticism by the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, into philosophical articulation and definition. This intellectual form synthesises Hasidic concepts of divine omnipresence and Jewish soulfulness with other historical components of Rabbinic literature, embodied in the Talmud, Jewish philosophy, Musar (ethical) literature and Lurianic Kabbalah. The &quot;Tanya&quot; has therefore been seen in Chabad as the defining Hasidic text and a subsequent stage of Jewish mystical evolution.

==Background to the Chabad approach==

The &quot;Tanya&quot; deals with Jewish spirituality, psychology and theology from the point of view of Hasidic philosophy and its inner explanations of Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism). It offers advice for each individual on how to serve God in his daily life.

===Early Hasidic movement===
The first few generations of the Hasidic movement established the various approaches of its different schools. The third generation great students of Dov Ber of Mezeritch, who spread out across Eastern Europe, became the leaders of Hasidism in Ukraine, Poland, Hungary and Russia. Among them, Schneur Zalman articulated a different approach to Hasidic philosophy from general Hasidism. The founding Hasidic mysticism of the Baal Shem Tov, and subsequent Hasidic Masters, emphasised the emotions of dveikus to cleave to the Omnipresent Divine. The intellectual (&quot;Chabad&quot;) approach of Schneur Zalman, continued by successive Lubavitch Rebbes, emphasised the mind as the route to the inner heart. The Chabad school requires knowledge of Godliness, drawn from Hasidic philosophy, to establish Hasidic mystical faith. This enabled Schneur Zalman to take Hasidus to Lithuanian Jews from nearby White Russia, and aroused the opposition of their early leaders. In this, Chabad is a separate offshoot of general Hasidism, and to its students is the profound fulfillment of systematically articulating its inner depths. Therefore, in Chabad, the Baal Shem Tov and Schneur Zalman, who share the same birthday, are called the &quot;two great luminaries&quot; (after Genesis 1:16, according to the Midrashic account, before the moon was diminished), representing heart and mind.

===Kabbalah and Hasidism===
The historical development of Kabbalah from the 12th century, and its new formulations in the 16th century, explained the subtle aspects and categories of the traditional system of Jewish metaphysics. Hasidic spirituality left aside the abstract focus of Kabbalah on the Spiritual Realms, to look at its inner meaning and soul as it relates to man in this World. The founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov, brought the Kabbalistic idea of Omnipresent Divine immanence in Creation into daily Jewish worship of the common folk. This enabled the popularisation of Kabbalah by relating it to the natural psychological perception and emotional dveikus (fervour) of man. The mystical dimension of Judaism became accessible and tangible to the whole community. Outwardly this was expressed in new veneration of sincerity, emphasis on prayer and deeds of loving-kindness. The unlettered Jewish folk were cherished and encouraged in their sincere simplicity, while the elite scholars sought to emulate their negation of ego through study of Hasidic exegetical thought. Hagiographic storytelling about Hasidic Masters captured the mystical charisma of the tzaddik. The inner dimension of this mystical revival of Judaism was expressed by the profound new depth of interpretation of Jewish mysticism in Hasidic philosophy. Great scholars also followed the Baal Shem Tov as they saw the profound meanings of his new teachings. The Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s successor Dov Ber of Mezeritch became the architect of the Hasidic movement, and explained to his close circle of disciples the underlying meanings of the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s explanations, parables and stories.

===Chabad===
Mind versus heart. Among Dov Ber&#x27;s disciples, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi formed Hasidic philosophy into a profound intellectual system, called &quot;Chabad&quot; after the Kabbalistic terms for the intellect, that differs from mainstream Hasidic emotional approaches to mystical faith. This seeks inward Jewish observance, while seeing charismatic Hasidic enthusiasm as external and downplaying it. The mysticism of Schneur Zalman did not seek cold intellectual investigation. In common with all of Hasidism, it awakens joy and negation of self-awareness, from the Jew&#x27;s perception of the Divine in all things. But Chabad, later to be called after its Russian village of Lubavitch, sees external emotional expression as superficial if devoid of inner contemplation. In this vein, it is related that the second Lubavitch Rebbe, Dov Ber Schneuri, would pray motionless for hours. Emotional expression was replaced with inner, hidden emotional ecstasy from his intellectual contemplation of Hasidic philosophy during prayer. At the end of praying, his hat and clothing would be soaked in perspiration. Typically, he wrote one of the most personal mystical accounts in Judaism, his &quot;Tract on Ecstasy&quot;, that instructs the Chabad follower in the levels of contemplation. This explains his father&#x27;s concept of the Chabad articulation of Hasidism. While the Baal Shem Tov stressed the heart, Schneur Zalman stressed the mind, but it was a warm, fiery mystical intellectualism.

Intellect versus faith. By giving Hasidus philosophical investigation, the Chabad school explained the inner meanings of the &quot;Torah of the Baal Shem Tov&quot;. Its systematic investigation enables the mind to grasp and internalize the transcendent spirituality of mainstream Hasidism. If the mind can bring the soul of Hasidism into understanding and knowledge through logic, then its effects on the person can be more inward. The classic writings of other Hasidic schools also relate the inner mysticism of Hasidic philosophy to the perception of each person. The aim of the Hasidic movement is to offer the Jewish mystical tradition in a new, internal form that speaks to every person. This would awaken spiritual awareness and feeling of God, through understanding of its mystical thought. Mainstream Hasidism relates this mystical revival through charismatic leadership and understanding based faith. The path of Schneur Zalman differs from other Hasidism, as it seeks to approach the heart through the development of the mind. Chabad writings of each generation of its dynasty, develop this intellectual explanation of Hasidic mystical ideas, into successively greater and more accessible reach. In recent times the last two Rebbes expressed the spiritual warmth of Chabad in terms of daily reality, language and relevance, in the Yiddish translations and memoires of Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, and especially the Likkutei Sichos of Menachem Mendel Schneerson.

Chabad Hasidus and other dimensions of Jewish thought. Because the approach of Chabad explains Hasidus in intellectual form, it can incorporate into its explanation the other aspects of historical Jewish thought. Complimentary or initially contradictory explanations of Jewish thought from Rabbinic Judaism, Jewish philosophy and Kabbalah can become synthesised into one unity. It can connect the different disciplines of mysticism (Kabbalah) and Jewish philosophy (Hakira), by relating to a higher, essential unity in Divinity, that harmonises diverse ideas. This approaches classic questions of theology from a different route than Hakira. The Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages, such as Maimonides, reconciled Judaism with Greek philosophy. Their explanations of the nature of the Divine, are related from man&#x27;s independent understanding from first principles. Hasidic thought looks to the inner meaning of Kabbalah, a conceptual system of metaphysics from mystical encounters with revelation. The insights it brings to theological questions, brought out in its Chabad explanation, are related from a mystical, higher reality &quot;from above&quot;. When Hasidic thought addresses traditional questions, such as Divine Providence, immanence and transcendence, it offers &quot;Inner Torah&quot; explanations of spirituality, that can also be harmonised with the explanations of the &quot;Revealed Torah&quot;. It is the ability of Hasidic thought to bring the abstract, esoteric systems of Kabbalah into conscious perception and mystical faith, by relating them to man&#x27;s inner psychological awareness. The ideal of the Chabad approach is to articulate this spiritual perception in terms of man&#x27;s understanding and knowledge.

==Structure==
According to legend, Rabbi Shneur Zalman published his &quot;Likkutei Amarim&quot; anonymously in 1797. Later editions incorporated additional writings by Shneur Zalman. The latest version of this work, dating from 1814, consists of five parts:

# &quot;Sefer shel Beinonim&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Average Men&quot;). This book is a Hasidic guide to the psychological drama of daily Jewish spiritual life. It describes how contemplating the mystical greatness of the Creator and the union that a Jew has with Him through the Torah&#x27;s commandments, can achieve the love and fear of God necessary for sincere worship. This approach is the fundamental theme of Chabad teaching: to achieve emotional refinement during prayer and Jewish observance. However, in the path offered, this emotion must stem from intellectual understanding of Hasidic mysticism. That is why this approach and the movement are called Chabad, after the three intellectual Sephirot (God&#x27;s emanations in Kabbalah): Chochmah (Wisdom), Binah (Understanding), Da&#x27;at (Knowledge). A Hasidic psychology of a Jew&#x27;s two souls is investigated, the Divine soul and the Natural soul. The Divine soul is a true &quot;part of God&quot;, a historic emphasis in Jewish thought, though based on earlier sources. The book&#x27;s guidance is for the intermediate person who is tempted by natural instincts, while the service of the true tzaddik in mystical thought is transcendent and only involved with holiness.
# &quot;Sha&#x27;ar ha-Yichud ve&#x27;ha&#x27;Emunah&quot; (&quot;The Gateway of Unity and Belief&quot;). This book outlines the theological background to the first section&#x27;s Hasidic life. It is an investigation of the meaning of God&#x27;s Unity in Hasidism. The Panentheism (all creation takes place &quot;within God&quot;) taught by the Baal Shem Tov is systematically articulated in Kabbalistic philosophy. God is all, but all is not God. Two levels of God&#x27;s Unity are both paradoxically true, based on the Kabbalistic doctrine of the Tzimtzum. In the &quot;Lower Unity&quot; all Creation is nullified to God. In the &quot;Higher Unity&quot;, Creation is an acosmic illusion as only God truly exists. The apparent plurality in Creation is only an effect of the concealments of Divinity. The origin of everything is nullification within the Divine Unity.
# &quot;Iggeret HaTeshuvah&quot; (&quot;Letter of Repentance&quot;). This gives the Hasidic interpretation and Chabad method of Teshuvah (Return to God). This section is also known as the &quot;Tanya Katan&quot; (&quot;Brief Tanya&quot;) as it is the gateway to all personal spiritual redemption. It describes the mystical return that not only leads to forgiveness for the sins but can fully enable the repenting person to be elevated to a spiritual place that is higher than where they were before the sin. In Hasidism any spiritual descent is only a preparation for a higher ascent. Two levels of Teshuvah are described, based on their meanings in Kabbalah. The &quot;Lower Teshuvah&quot; redeems sin. The &quot;Higher Teshuvah&quot; brings constant elevation unconnected to sin. Because of this, the founder of Hasidism taught that even saintly tzadikim are able to be inspired to do Teshuvah.
# &quot;Iggeret HaKodesh&quot; (&quot;Letter of Holiness&quot;). This section was not published until 1814, after Rabbi Shneur Zalman&#x27;s passing. It is a collection of letters which the author wrote to his disciples and different Hasidic communities, in which he talked about mystical aspects of certain commandments, such as charity, Torah study, or in general all commandments concerned with physical deed. Today it is used as a source of certain in-depth concepts of the &quot;Written Hasidism&quot; not concerned specifically with emotion felt during service or repentance. It is a more esoteric and detailed work of Kabbalistic commentary than the previous sections. Schematically it would relate to a person who had internalised the fundamental first three sections, and could progress higher.
# &quot;Kuntres Acharon&quot; (&quot;Last Thesis&quot;). This section was not published until 1814. It is also a series of letters in which the author resolved certain seeming controversies in Kabbalah. This section is an even more in-depth investigation of profound mystical notions than the previous one. Like the fourth section, it can be seen as an addition to the first three fundamental sections.

In general, the first book is a universal Jewish guidebook to &quot;avodah&quot;, everyday Divine service, through Schneur Zalman&#x27;s innovative system, applying Jewish mysticism step-by-step to the internal drama of human psychology. As a formative approach guidebook in Judaism, the English translator of the first section, in his introduction, compares its position with Maimonides&#x27; Guide for the Perplexed, but contrasts the spiritual guidance aim of Tanya with the philosophical aim of Maimonides. The second section&#x27;s philosophical exposition of Hasidic mystical Panentheism is the underlying foundation for contemplation methods in the first part, and gives the theoretical definition of Hasidism&#x27;s theology of God. The third section guides individuals in a Habad Hasidic approach to repentance, to be able to prepare more deeply for the first part&#x27;s guidance. The last two added sections give more complicated and in-depth Hasidic exposition of Kabbalistic concepts, the author uniting abstract ideas with the importance of everyday service and an emotion that must accompany it. These discourses are similar to the exegetical commentaries of Schneur Zalman in his other works, though here they sometimes take the form of letters to his followers, with more direct advice.

==Subject matter==
Most of the work&#x27;s first part, &quot;The Book of the Average Man&quot;, the &quot;beinoni&quot;, serves as a fundamental and basic guide to the spiritual service of God.

Unlike other early Hasidic works, this book is not a collection of sermons or stories, but rather a systematic exposition of Shneur Zalman&#x27;s philosophy. Lubavitcher Hasidim are enjoined to study from this work each day as part of Chitas - an acronym for Chumash, Tehillim and Tanya. The Rebbes of Chabad taught that it is a sacred duty to publish and distribute this book as widely as possible.

The Tanya seeks to demonstrate to the &quot;average&quot; Jewish man or woman that knowledge of God is there for the taking, that spiritual growth to ever higher levels is real and imminent, if one is willing to engage in the struggle. Although many view the Tanya as a work of explanation on Kabbalah or Jewish mysticism, its approbations make clear that Tanya is first and foremost a book of advice in the practical service of God.

===Levels of divine service ===
The Tanya describes five levels:
*The complete &quot;tzaddik&quot; (&quot;righteous person&quot;) has transformed his animal soul completely, to the point that it is able to reach intense Godly delight in its connection to Godliness, and is averse to all worldly pleasures.
*The incomplete &quot;tzaddik&quot; no longer desires evil in a way that will be externally expressed, even on the level of thought; however, a minute amount of desire for very subtle evil remains.
*The &quot;beinoni&quot; (lit. &quot;intermediate one&quot;) possesses an animal soul that still desires evil, but he succeeds at constantly restraining himself from sin in action, speech, and even thought; this, however, requires ongoing tension and struggle. This struggle is not simply the confrontation between good and evil, but rather the ongoing encounter between one&#x27;s two souls - the animal and the divine - the soul that draws downward toward the earth, and the soul that aspires upward toward Hashem.
*The incomplete &quot;rasha&quot; (&quot;evil person&quot;) will commit sins, however depending on the level of good in the incomplete rasha he will either repent or merely thoughts of repentance will enter his thoughts.
*The complete &quot;rasha&quot; has sinned so frequently that none of his thought, speech, or action are controlled by the divine soul (though it remains in an &quot;external&quot; state of makkif attached to him), and he is exclusively controlled by his animal soul.

==Jewish criticism==

The &quot;Tanya&#x27;s&quot; hypotheses that every Jew has two souls and that the souls of non-Jews are fundamentally different from those of Jews (with non-Jewish souls originating from the realm of evil) have been controversial. More precisely, the &quot;Tanya&quot; states that Jewish people have two souls: the &quot;nefesh elokis&quot; (or divine soul) and the &quot;nefesh behamis&quot; (or animal soul), which is not inherently evil but basic. It states that non-Jews have only the latter.

Various writers have asserted that this idea has the potential to develop into or to provide support for racism or that it endorses a kind of &quot;metaphysical racism&quot;.

==Exposition==
In Chabad, the &quot;Tanya&quot; is said to be the Written Torah of Hasidic philosophy, for it is the first work of Hasidic philosophy recorded by its own author, in contrast to the works of the Ba&#x27;al Shem Tov and the Maggid of Mezritch, whose words were transcribed by their disciples. This implies that the teachings of Hasidic philosophy in general are all an exposition of the &quot;Tanya&quot;, just as the Torah teaches that the entire purpose of the Oral Torah is to elucidate the Written Torah.

In his preface to the &quot;Tanya&quot;, the author writes that anyone with questions about the meaning or application of the &quot;Tanya&quot;&#x27;s guidance should approach &quot;the great ones in his city.&quot; In Chabad Hasidic parlance such a guide is known as a Mashpia. Such a person is trained by his predecessors in correct application of the &quot;Tanya&quot;.

Many works have been written explaining the &quot;Tanya&quot;, in particular: the Lubavitcher Rebbe&#x27;s &quot;Reshimos&quot; on the &quot;Tanya&quot;, &quot;HaLekach VehaLibuv&quot;, &quot;Shiu&#x27;rim BeSefer HaTanya&quot; (in its English translation, known as &quot;Lessons in Tanya&quot;), &quot;Maskil Le&#x27;Eisan&quot;, &quot;Biurei Ha&#x27;Tanya&quot;, and &quot;Opening The &quot;Tanya&quot;&quot;, &quot;Learning the &quot;Tanya&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Understanding the &quot;Tanya&quot;&quot; by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz.

The Tanya had a great influence upon Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira of Piaseczno who quotes it many times in his works. In his &quot;Mevo HaShearim&quot; he contrasts the approach of the Tanya to that of Karliner Hasidism.

<doc id="255823" wikidata="Q927338" url="?curid=255823" title="List of prime ministers of Canada">
<text>The prime minister of Canada is an official who serves as the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Twenty-three people (twenty-two men and one woman) have served as prime ministers. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the governor general of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons. Normally, this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But if that leader lacks the support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.

The 23rd and current prime minister is Justin Trudeau, who assumed office on 4 November 2015. There are currently five living former prime ministers. The most recent former prime minister to die was Brian Mulroney, on 29 February 2024.

==Model==
The office is not outlined in any of the documents that constitute the written portion of the Constitution of Canada; executive authority is formally vested in the sovereign and exercised on the sovereign&#x27;s behalf by the governor general. The prime ministership is part of Canada&#x27;s constitutional convention tradition. The office was modelled after that which existed in the United Kingdom at the time. John A. Macdonald was commissioned by the Viscount Monck on 24 May 1867, to form the first government of the Canadian Confederation. On 1 July 1867, the first ministry assumed office.

==Term==
When the prime minister begins their term is determined by the date that they are sworn into their portfolio, as an oath of office as prime minister is not required. However, since 1957, all incoming prime ministers have sworn an oath as prime minister. Before 1920, prime ministers&#x27; resignations were accepted immediately by the governor general and the last day of the ministries were the date he died or the date of resignation. Since 1920, the outgoing prime minister has only formally resigned when the new government is ready to be formed. The &quot;Interpretation Act&quot; of 1967 states that &quot;where an appointment is made effective or terminates on a specified day, that appointment is considered to be effective or to terminate after the end of the previous day&quot;. Thus, although the outgoing prime minister formally resigns only hours before the incoming ministry swears their oaths, both during the day, the ministries are effectively changed at midnight the night before. Some sources, including the Parliament of Canada, apply this convention as far back as 1917. Two prime ministers have died in office: John A. Macdonald (1867–1873, 1878–1891), and John Thompson (1892–1894), both of natural causes. All others have resigned, either after losing an election or upon retirement.

==Prime ministers==
Canadian custom is to count by the individuals who were prime minister, not by terms. Since Confederation, 23 prime ministers have been &quot;called upon&quot; by the governor general to form 29 Canadian ministries.

<doc id="255829" wikidata="Q13778" url="?curid=255829" title="Catanduanes">
<text>Catanduanes (; ), officially the Province of Catanduanes (), is an island province located in the Bicol Region of Luzon in the Philippines. It is the 12th-largest island in the Philippines, and lies to the east of Camarines Sur, across the Maqueda Channel. Its capital, and most populated town, is Virac. Catanduanes had a population of 271,879 people as of the 2020 census.

The province comprises Catanduanes (mainland or main island), Panay Island, Leyte Island, the Palumbanes group of islands (Porongpong, Tignob, and Calabagio), and a few other small, surrounding islets and rocks. The province is also home to various mollusk fossil sites, notably the second-oldest ammonite site in the Philippines. These sites contain certain species of ammonites that are found nowhere else in Southeast Asia. Because of the province&#x27;s importance and rich geologic history, scholars have suggested that it could be named a UNESCO Geopark Reserve.

In the early 20th century, Catanduanes was a sub-province of Ambos Camarines. Later, it was a sub-province of Albay. It became an autonomous province in 1945. Congressman Francisco Perfecto filed &quot;House Bill No. 301&quot;, which separated the province from Albay; the bill was approved on September 26, 1945, and signed into law by President Sergio Osmeña on October 24, 1945. Remigio Socito, previously the Lieutenant Governor, was appointed the first Provincial Governor. When elections were held in 1947, Alfonso V. Usero became the first elected Governor.

On April 15, 2022, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Republic Act No. 11700 declaring Catanduanes province as the Philippines’ Abacá Capital.

==Etymology==
Catanduanes&#x27; earliest recorded name was &quot;Isla de Cobos&quot;. This was the name given to it by the Spanish &quot;conquistadors&quot;, early in 1573, when they came upon several tribes on the island who were living in the thatched huts that the tribal people called &quot;cobos&quot;.

“Catanduanes” comes from the words &quot;tandu&quot;, a native beetle, and &quot;samdong&quot;, a native species of tree, both of which were found throughout the island. People often referred to the island as &quot;katanduan&quot; or &quot;kasamdongan&quot;, meaning ‘a place where the &quot;tandu&quot; and the &quot;samdong&quot; tree thrive in abundance.’ The pronunciation of this word by Spanish-speaking people led to the coining of the Hispanicized version, &quot;Catanduanes&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
Rulers (datus) from Borneo settled on the island of Panay. Their descendants then migrated throughout the archipelago and became the first settlers in Catanduanes.

The island was raided more than once by the Moros, who lived on the island of Mindanao. As a result of these destructive raids, many records of the past were destroyed or lost.

===Spanish period===
In 1573, Juan de Salcedo arrived in Catanduanes while hunting for pirates and conquered the natives. Three years later, a galleon expedition from Acapulco was shipwrecked near the island, and the survivors were either killed or enslaved. This event is commemorated at the Batalay Church in Bato, a few kilometers outside the capital town of Virac.

====Evangelization and Christianization====
The evangelization of the island started twenty years later, when the Spanish soldiers, after subjugating the Bicol mainland, came back with Franciscan missionaries. The missionaries, armed with the cross and backed by the sword of the conquistadors, evangelized the entire population, beginning with the southern tribes, without meeting much resistance.

From 1600 to 1857, the colonizers established nine local centers of government through the establishment of parishes: &quot;Caramoran&quot; (1601); &quot;Pandan&quot; (1650); &quot;Viga&quot; (1661); &quot;Panganiban&quot; (1663); &quot;Virac&quot; (1775); &quot;Bato&quot; (1830); and &quot;San Andres&quot; (1853).

===American period===
During the period of American rule, Bagamanoc, which had been a thriving municipality during the Spanish period, was reduced to a mere barrio of Viga and later of Panganiban.

During the American Regime, some locals refused to recognize the sovereignty of the United States, and most of them fled to the mountains. The American occupation did not last long. By 1934, the Americans had withdrawn from control of the island.

===Japanese occupation===
During World War II, Catanduanes was not spared from Japanese invasion. The Japanese erected garrisons in different parts of the island and heavily fortified it.

===Philippine independence===
Three months after the Philippine independence from the Americans, Catanduanes was finally recognized as a separate and independent province from Albay through &quot;Commonwealth Act No. 687&quot; authored by then-Representative Francisco Perfecto. The independence was approved by Congress on September 26, 1945, signed into law by President Sergio Osmena Sr. on October 24, 1945, and took effect on October 26, 1945.

Catanduanes became the sixth province of the Bicol Region with the signing of the Act. Remigio Socito, Catanduanes&#x27;s last Lieutenant Governor was appointed as the first Provincial Governor. When elections were held in 1947, Alfonso V. Usero became the first elected Governor.

On September 26, 1945, Catanduanes was recognized as a separate and independent province. By Republic Act No. 159, dated June 26, 1947, the municipality of Caramoran was recreated out of the Municipality of Pandan; under R.A. No. 491, dated June 12, 1950, the Municipality of Bagamanoc was also created.

Gigmoto formally became a municipality again in 1951, as did San Miguel in 1952. Also in the early 1950s, another center of government, Baras, was created. It was during this period that the island saw economic development and growth. Interlinking roads were built and trading centers were created.

==Geography==
Catanduanes is situated on the easternmost edge of Luzon: 13.3 to 14.1 degrees north latitudes and between 124.1 and 124.3 degrees east longitudes. The island bounded on the west by the Maqueda Channel, on the south by Lagonoy Gulf, and on the north and east by the Philippine Sea. Several small islands comprise the province. Its aggregate land area totals approximately . The coastlines, that stretch to almost , are jagged with many bays.

The topography of Catanduanes Island is rugged and mountainous, becoming more pronounced towards the central portion of the island. Less than 10 percent of the land area has a slope gradient under 8%, mostly fractured and narrow strips of plains located along the coastal areas where most of the inhabitants are settled. The highest mountain peak is in Boctot, located between the municipalities of Virac and San Miguel with an elevation of above sea level. It is the premier mountain range with broadly spread old-growth forests and watershed which exerts widespread influence over its immediate environs that include the municipalities of Virac, Bato, and San Miguel. Other prominent mountain forms include the ranges: Obi in Caramoran, Cagmasoso in San Andres, and the Summit and Magsumoso ranges within the Viga and Gigmoto areas.

The lowlands include the Virac Plain, Viga Plain, San Andres Plain and the Bato River Flood Plain. The coastal municipalities with limited lowland agricultural areas are Pandan and Caramoran. The more extensive lowlands are found in the southern parts of the province. The largest coastal plain is the contiguous wetlands of Viga, Panganiban and Bagamanoc over which lies the widest area of rice paddies and nipa mangroves.

The province is mostly rugged and mountainous terrain. Its slope characteristics are 13% gently sloping to undulating, 1% classified rolling to hilly, 2% very hills and mountains, 47% level to very gently sloping, 32% steep hills and mountainous, and 5% undulating to rolling. Ten of the eleven municipalities of the province is situated along the coastal fringes, over which locate its mostly fractured plains. The only landlocked municipality is San Miguel with its &quot;poblacion&quot; (town center) sitting in a location entirely devoid of flatlands. The majority of the built-up areas occupy zones that are classified as flat to rolling.

===Flora and Fauna===

The island is a biodiversity hotspot. Its rainforests are home to the Philippine brown deer, flying foxes, and other endemic bat species, warty pigs, civets, cobras, giant pythons, monitor lizards, sailfin lizards and other endemic animals. Exotic bird species such as the Philippine hornbill, rail, parrot, bittern, egret, pheasant, coot, lapwing, plover, Philippine duck, quail, owl, oriole, kingfisher, swiftlets and many more are also found. A record of &quot;Philippines Birding Trip Reports&quot; has found massive bird species in several parts of the island such as the watershed and timberland forests reserve in Gigmoto where scattered deer populations are also usually reported.

The Catanduanes bleeding-heart (&quot;Gallicolumba luzonica rubiventris&quot;) had experienced over-exploitation in the late 20th century. Although most forests are still intact, this species has suffered overhunting, making it very rare and is believed to be near extinction or already extinct as its last reported specimen was collected in 1971.

The southern giant slender-tailed cloud rat (&quot;budkon&quot;/&quot;bugkon&quot;), which is found only in Catanduanes and the southern half of Luzon Island, is still widely reported. It is critically endangered as humans hunt them for food and to some extent, as pets. In mainland Luzon, sightings of the creature are already rare while in Marinduque, it is generally considered extinct.

Inventory of the entomological fauna on the island has been conducted by various scientific institutions. A survey that was submitted to the national museum has revealed interesting species in the forest reserve of Gigmoto and Pandan. A total of 2,000 entomological specimens and its allies were collected compromising 323 species under 45 genera and 50 families.

The Catanduanes narrow-mouthed frog (&quot;Kaloula kokacii&quot;), an arboreal amphibian found only in Catanduanes and some parts of Bicol, enjoys its diversity but is being carefully monitored. Another endemic amphibian &quot;Hylarana similis&quot; is found only in Catanduanes and Luzon islands. The published research by Brown and Siler in the Journal of Biogeography (2013) actually reported this species in the forests of Gigmoto.

One of the very recent species found in Catanduanes and portions of the Bicol region is the new loam-swimming skink, a legless reptile with its assigned scientific name &quot;Brachymeles makes&quot;.

The dipterocarp forest also harbors numerous tropical plant species including the threatened species of pitcher plants and rafflesia as well as endemic banana varieties. Many highly economical hardwood trees such as yakal, apitong, palosapis, and molave are still found in the central forests through local reports indicate that these species are already threatened. Mangrove forests exist in several coastal areas but the largest locations are in Banquerohan (Viga-Panganiban), Agoho in San Andres, and Batalay in Bato.

The Catanduanes reefs harbor many endangered and threatened types of mollusks such as giant Triton, cowries, abalone, cone snails, conches, octopuses, squids, and nautiluses. Marine mammals are also reported to frequent on its eastern coasts such as species of dolphins and whales, which appear from March to June. Many edible marine algae such as caulerpa, valonia, and turbellaria also grow abundantly on its rough coasts.

The island is nestled in the very beginning of the Kuroshio Current, a sea current that runs through the eastern Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan. Tuna migration, which is at its peak in the months of April and May, can be seen in the Maqueda channel. Dugongs were once known to swim on Catanduanes coasts, but this event is already becoming extremely rare.

The Catanduanes coast is one of the best spots for the flying fish population; a flying fish can attain its fullest size in Catanduanes which may weigh . Rabbitfish &quot;Siganus sp&quot;., a type of reef fish is one of the most heavily exploited marine tropical fish in Catanduanes. Its fry that comes out in shallow coasts during the breeding season (March–May) is fished in large volumes. Approximately 10 million rabbitfish fries are caught annually. This natural event supplies food for many people but its ecological impact can be devastating. Nature advocates started to strengthen their campaign for an eco-dialogue for this matter. Sea cucumbers are also abundant in many islets of the eastern coasts facing the Philippine Sea.

Palumbanes (province satellite group of islands) has beaches with fine yellowish-white sand. It is also one of the most biodiverse marine zones on the island. However, coral reef exploitation has been severely inflicted for the last 10 years on its waters. The local government and some sectors are already undergoing efforts to revive Palumbanes Island by building artificial reefs and employing fishing regulations.

===Rivers===
*Maygñaway River, drains into the Philippine Sea

===Weather and climate===
Without a pronounced dry season, precipitation is distributed fairly well throughout the year becoming wetter in the last quarter into the early months of the first quarter, when tropical disturbances and monsoon winds especially the Northeast Monsoon (&quot;Amihan&quot;) bring in heavy rains. Other months are characterized by short periods of dryer days and fine weather, except in July and August when the dry and gusty southwest monsoon winds intensify.

Catanduanes&#x27; geographical position has it lying completely exposed to the Philippine Sea. Therefore, it is known as &quot;Land of the Howling Winds&quot; because it is frequently visited by tropical cyclones.

==Administrative divisions==
Catanduanes comprises 11 municipalities, all encompassed by the lone district.

==Demographics==
The population of Catanduanes in the 2020 census was 271,879 people, with a density of .

In May 2000, its total population was 215,356 with an annual growth rate of 1.42% from 1990 to 2000, and a population density of 142 per km2. Over the following 10 years, the average annual growth rate was 1.35%, increasing the population to 246,300 persons in the May 2010 census. Almost all of the people of the province are natural born citizens. Naturalized citizens, most of which are Chinese, comprised only about one percent of the population.

The number of households totaled 41,019 with an average household size of 5.25.

===Religion===

Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities. Among these deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Aswang, his brother was trying to steal. Whenever people disobey Gugurang and commit sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways. Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.; Asuang, the evil god who always tries to steal the sacred fire of Mount Mayon from his brother, Gugurang. Addressed sometimes as Aswang, he dwells mainly inside Mount Malinao. As an evil god, he would cause the people to suffer misfortunes and commit sins. Enemy of Gugurang and a friend of Bulan the god of the Moon; Haliya, the masked goddess of the moonlight and the arch-enemy of Bakunawa and protector of Bulan. Her cult is composed primarily of women. There is also a ritual dance named after her as it is performed to be a counter-measure against Bakunawa.; &quot;Bulan&quot;, the god of the pale moon, he is depicted as a pubescent boy with uncommon comeliness that made savage beast and the vicious mermaids (Magindara) tame. He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang&#x27;s grip; &quot;Magindang&quot;, the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the Moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately; &quot;Okot&quot;, god of forest and hunting; and &quot;Bakunawa&quot;, a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the Sun and the Moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa&#x27;s main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.

====Catholicism====

Roman Catholicism is the religion of the vast majority, comprising 97% of Catanduanes&#x27; population.

====Others====
The remaining faith of the inhabitants is divided into the various groups such as Aglipayan Church, Baptists, Methodists, and other evangelical Christians, as well as Mormons, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Iglesia ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventists as well as Muslims.

===Languages===
There are two variants of the Bikol languages native to this island province: Northern Catanduanes Bicolano and Southern Catanduanes Bicolano. The northern accent has a very pronounced letter &quot;R&quot; that becomes a diphthong of non-vowel letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; in the southern towns. In written form, the conventional mainland language like Central Bikol is used. Filipino, by virtue of being officially taught in schools and the affinity of most Bicolanos to it, is the second most common language and easily the most understood by most people. English is the normal medium used in primary communications. The use of the Spanish language as a local language seems to have vanished after the turn of the early 21st century.

====Sociolinguistics====
When the Spaniards came to the Philippines, Catanduanes, being on the Pacific Ocean side and on the
very route of the galleon ships, was one of the first places they penetrated to propagate Christianity. The Spanish priests founded churches in every town. People from mainland Bicol also traveled to Catanduanes, specifically Caramoran, which is directly across from Albay.

The research of McFarland on the year 1974, the dialects of Bicol area, stated that until the advent of the twentieth century and the development brought about by modernization, Northern Catanduanes was quite isolated from mainland Bicol and Southern Catanduanes, resulting in less opportunity for contact between different groups. One probable reason why the Northern Catanduanes language variety is distinct from the Southern Catanduanes variety is that the mountainous terrain separating the north from the south acts as a barrier to community interaction. The lack of good roads and transportation arising from the terrain contributed to the present situation. Since the seaport is in Virac, Northern Catanduanes remained in isolation from other subgroups for quite some time. Furthermore, the inhabitants of Northern Catanduanes were the first occupants of the island to have been pushed northwards when immigrants from the mainland occupied the southern part of the island. This supports the closeness of the Southern Catanduanes variety to other Bicol subgroups while the Northern Catanduanes variety has more distinct features.

===Ethnic groups===
The predominant ethnic group is the Bicolano people. Migrants from other parts of Luzon, as well as Visayas and Mindanao, make up a minority as well. Few, who are of Chinese, Australian, American, and Spanish descent also live in the province.

==Government==

Catanduanes was historically a part of the Albay province. On October 26, 1945, it was separated from Albay and was declared an island-province through &quot;Commonwealth Act No. 687&quot;.

When the island was still in transition to becoming a full-fledged province, it was headed by Lt. Governor Felipe Olesco Usero.

Gubernatorial elections for Catanduanes started in 1948. The People Power Revolution in February 1986 ushered in new leadership. Former Ambassador Leandro I. Verceles Sr. was appointed Governor of the province. In 1988, Governor Leandro I. Verceles Sr. ran for Governor and won the election. His term ended in 1992 when lost to Governor Rosalie A. Estacio. After Governor Estacio, Governor Severo C. Alcantara became the governor of the province in 1995. Gov. Alcantara did not run for re-election due to failing health. In 1998 Governor Hector S. Sanchez won the election. Governor Sanchez ran for re-election but lost to Governor Leandro B. Verceles Jr who became governor for two successive terms.

In the 2007 elections, Verceles ran again for his third and last term for governor. He lost to Joseph C. Cua, who became governor from 2007 to 2013 for two successive terms. Cua then lost to Araceli B. Wong in the 2013 elections. In the 2016 elections, Araceli Wong&#x27;s son Jardin Brian Wong lost to reelectionist Joseph Cua in his reelection bid as governor of the province.

===Congressional district(s)===
The lone Legislative District of Catanduanes is the representation of the Province of Catanduanes in the Philippine House of Representatives. Catanduanes was represented as part of Albay&#x27;s second district from 1907 to 1931, and fully comprised that province&#x27;s fourth district from 1931 to 1946. It started electing its own representative in 1946, after becoming a full-fledged province in 1945. From 1978 to 1984 it was part of the representation of Region V.

* Rep. Eulogio R. Rodriguez (IND)

==Economy==

The province recorded just a little −0.3 in the HDI National Average, although it has the highest HDI in the Bicol Region. The 2009 report of HDN (Human Development Network), which is a branch of the United Nations HDI (Human Development Index), listed the province as ranked 1st in the region or rank 20th at 0.630 HDI value (excluding Metro Manila) among Philippine Provinces HDI&#x27;s. For reference, the province of Albay ranked 2nd in the region or ranked 41st among Philippine Provinces HDIs (excluding Metro Manila) at 0.518 HDI value.

Agriculture, fishing, and tourism are some of the other main sources of employment on the island. Several handicrafts such as jewelry manufacturing and other small-scale industries also contribute to the province&#x27;s economy. The province is rich in natural resources such as forests, waterfalls, rivers, mineral deposits and productive soil made fertile by volcanic ashes of distant Mayon Volcano. Rattancraft, fishing, buri hat and mat making, and abaca fiber craft are among the important industries of the island. Bananatex, a natural cellulosic biodegradable &quot;technical&quot; canvas fabric, manufactured by QWSTION, is made of abacá banana plant fibres and grown as a sustainable forestry industry.

Virac, the capital town of the island was among the top in terms of infrastructure in 2012 Most Competitive Municipality category according to the National Competitiveness Council (NCC).

===Industry===

The five major income sources of Catanduanes are the services, agriculture, and fishing, tourism, housing, and manufacturing industries.

====Cottage industry and manufacturing====
From 2001 through 2010, the Philippines production of abaca fiber (Manila hemp) averaged 65,701 mt per year and was decreasing at a rate of at least 0.8% per annum. The decrease was caused by the devastating typhoons in 2006, abaca viral diseases that continued to affect the plantations, and the dampened foreign demand brought about by the global economic recession beginning in the latter part of 2008, the most severe downturn since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Production reached its peak in 2008 at 77,387 mt as outputs of all producing regions, particularly Bicol, Davao Region and Caraga, substantially increased during the period. This was primarily the effect of the incremental production from the abaca plantations established in 2005 and 2006 under FIDA&#x27;s program Goal I &quot;Development of New Agri-Business Lands&quot; and the continued strong demand and attractive prices offered for the fiber by local traders, processors/manufacturers, and exporters. The abaca industry, however, suffered a setback in 2009 when fiber yield slumped to its lowest level of 54,584 mt due to the weakened market demand and falling prices as a consequence of the worldwide financial crisis. Catanduanes Island is the native habitat of the endemic abaca plant (a banana relative), which is globally renowned for its strong fiber. In fact, the Philippines FIDA (Fiber Industry Development Authority) declared the island as the highest abaca-producing province in 2010.

In 2009–2013, The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine Abaca production, emerged as the biggest produce while overwhelming 92% comes from Catanduanes the biggest abaca-producing province in the country. The home of the finest grade of abaca fiber. Lately, the indigenous abaca fiber, commonly called &quot;pinukpok,&quot; produced and woven by the locals of Baras, Catanduanes, has now found its niche in the local and international fashion industry. This indigenous fabric has shown its versatility in the globally appealing designs and creations of famous fashion designer Dita Sandico-Ong. Until now wild type of abaca can still be found in the interior forests of the province which is often not cultivated.

=====World&#x27;s Abaca Top Producer=====
Despite having been ravaged by three super typhoons in the last two decades, Catanduanes has maintained its &quot;abaca country&quot; status as the top abaca fiber-producing province in the Philippines. In 2015 alone, the island&#x27;s 12,789 abaca farmers produced 23,550 metric tons of raw fiber, comprising 40 percent of the total abaca fiber production nationwide. The local fiber harvest is even higher than the production of Ecuador, the second-biggest abaca producer in the world after the Philippines.

====Agriculture and fishing====

Catanduanes mud crab industry is being supported by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Labor and Employment and Catanduanes State University.

The provincial government is maintaining the Catanduanes Crab Center (CCC) which serves as a source of crablets for grow-out and fattening by fishpond operators. It carries out a special program for &quot;queen&quot; or &quot;gravid&quot; crabs designed to ensure the sustainability of the industry in the province, which originally owned the &quot;crab capital of the Philippines&quot; title. The province&#x27;s mud crab industry is focusing on the production of female crabs that play an important role in marketing, particularly in Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

===Income===
Commonwealth Act No. 687, created Catanduanes as an independent province; however, it was Republic Act 7160 that gave the Local Government Unit (LGU) total independence in managing its administrative, fiscal, and development affairs in conformity with the national government thrust for sustainable social and economic growth.


==Tourism==

The tourism industry in the province is growing relatively quickly despite the fact that the island experiences almost year-round typhoons, labeling the province as a &quot;Typhoon Capital of the Philippines&quot; with the tagline &quot;The Land of the Howling Winds&quot;. Catanduanes is known for its beaches, prehistoric caves, quaint stone chapels and massive churches. Despite the typhoons, safe anchorage is provided by its many bays and coves notably Kalapalan, Gigmoto, Soboc, and Cabugao. Its Pacific coastline attracts surfers, particularly at Baras. The province features beaches with fine sand and coral formations and several caves which include the Luyang Cave.

<text>ACCAC (the acronym of Awdurdod Cymwysterau, Cwricwlwm ac Asesu Cymru) was the Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for [[Wales]]. On 1 April 2006, it merged with the Welsh Assembly Government&#x27;s new Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills (DCELLS). ACCAC was an exempt charity, and an Assembly Sponsored Public Body responsible for advising the National Assembly for Wales on matters relating to education and s. All external qualifications in Wales were regulated by ACCAC with the exception of NVQs, which QCA is responsible for.

ACCAC was based in Cardiff. Its English equivalent is the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA).

<doc id="255831" wikidata="Q7277354" url="?curid=255831" title="ROF Bridgwater">
<text>[[Royal Ordnance Factory]] (ROF) [[Bridgwater]] was a factory between the villages of Puriton and Woolavington in the Sedgemoor district of Somerset, England that produced high explosives for munitions. It was slightly above sea level, between the contour lines on Ordnance Survey maps. BAE Systems closed it when decommissioning was completed in July 2008.

==History==

It was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply, with the Ministry of Works as s. It was designed as an Explosive ROF to produce RDX, a new experimental high-explosive developed at the RGPF Waltham Abbey. Construction work started in 1939 and it opened in 1941.

On 29 June 1951, an explosion killed six men. No cause was ever identified.

It was also known as &quot;&quot;ROF 37&quot;, a name that was reflected in its sports and social association, the &quot;37 Club&quot;&quot;, just outside the perimeter fence.

===Infrastructure===
As munitions production needed a guaranteed year-round clean water supply of several million gallons per day, the site was ideal, being able to obtain supplies from the water-logged Somerset Levels:
*the artificial Huntspill River, dug during construction;
*the King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain, widened at the same time;
*water that accumulated due to the high water table in the &quot;Borrow Pits&quot;, dug to produce traverses around the explosive magazines.

Both the waterways are now an integral part of the drainage system of the Somerset Levels.

The factory was essentially self-supporting other than for raw materials. It generated high-pressure steam for heating and production processes using its own coal-fired power station; it could also produce electricity using a steam turbine. During World War II before the National Grid was fully developed, it was connected to two independent power stations, Portishead (now demolished) and Shepton Mallet.

Between 1940 and 1941, housing for workers was built as &quot;pre-fabs&quot; in the adjacent village of Woolavington. Hostels for single workers were built at nearby Dunball, by the King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain.

The site was guarded until shortly after privatisation by the MoD Police, which had its barracks and canteen opposite the main gates. These have long since been demolished. Three brick MoD Police houses are still in use on the Woolavington Road, but they are no longer occupied by the police.

The factory was connected to the Great Western Railway (GWR) by a private, standard-gauge branch line and sidings with its own locomotive. This was used both for supplies, such as acid in tanker wagons from ICI and coal for the power station, and for distribution of the finished product.

A bridge was built in the early 1970s to carry the line over the M5 motorway, just north of junction 23, when the M5 was extended southwards from the M50. The line became disused after the privatisation of the ROFs and the track has been lifted. The British Rail sidings were known as &quot;Huntspill (Puriton)&quot;.

===Production===
During the construction period it appears that the decision was made to fill munitions, including the bouncing bomb, with a mixture of TNT and RDX rather than RDX alone. The factory manufactured RDX in two separate production units, then sent to Filling Factories such as ROF Chorley and ROF Glascoed for filling into munitions. It also concentrated and re-cycled its own sulphuric acid.

Like all ROFs at the time, the factory was a production factory: formulation of explosives, propellants and munitions was carried out at separate government-owned research and development establishments such as the Research Department, initially at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich and then Fort Halstead; and at PERME Waltham Abbey, later transferred to RARDE Fort Halstead. After privatisation Royal Ordnance PLC took over some of this capability, other parts being closed or becoming part of QinetiQ.

==Post World War II==
During the slack period between 1945 and the Korean War the factory and ROF Chorley and ROF Glascoed built two-storey pre-fabricated concrete houses. 

===Additional capability===
* Production of the new high explosive HMX was added in 1955.
* In the 1960s and 1970s, the factory started producing plastic rocket propellant with ammonium perchlorate and poly-isobutylene rubber as two of its main ingredients.
* Trinitrotoluene (TNT) manufacture was added in 1980.

==Privatisation==
Royal Ordnance factories were privatised on 2 January 1985 and became part of the Explosive Division of Royal Ordnance Plc, later RO Defence. RO Defence was acquired by BAE Systems in the 1990s and was subsumed into BAE Systems Land Systems. The factory closed in July 2008. In 2017, it was bought by the merchant bank Salamanca Group in a multi-million pound deal to create Gravity - a &#x27;low carbon smart campus&#x27; which is now a subsidiary of the Salamanca Group. 

In February 2024, Tata Group confirmed it would invest £4 billion to create a battery factory, built by Agratas, on the Gravity site. Battery production is set to begin in 2026, with the creation of around 4,000 jobs.

<doc id="255832" wikidata="Q2081178" url="?curid=255832" title="Puriton">
<text>Puriton is a village and parish at the westerly end of the Polden Hills, in Somerset, England. The parish has a population of 1,968. The local parish church is dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. A chapel on Woolavington Road was converted to a private house some 20 years ago. The parish includes the hamlets of Dunball and Down End.

In 1996, the village was described as &quot;now becoming a rural commuter village&quot;. The built-up area is mostly between 5 and 50 metres above sea level.

The village has a full range of facilities, such as a primary school, parish church, pub, post office, butcher and hairdresser. It started to expand considerably in the 1960s and 1970s when new houses were built on former farm land, a former infilled stone Blue Lias quarry, &quot;Puriton Park&quot;, and on fields between the existing houses. The old Victorian school near the church was converted into homes and a new school built elsewhere. The Manor House was sold in 1960 and four houses were built on its former tennis courts; the House is in multiple occupancy.

==History==

Puriton was mentioned in the Domesday Book as growing pears, and was held by the Church of St Peter&#x27;s, Rome. Its parish church was St Michael&#x27;s.

Just north of Dunball is Down End which is the site of Down End Castle, a motte-and-bailey castle, which has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

The parish was part of the Huntspill and Puriton Hundred,

A cement and lime works was at the western end of the Polden Hills, at Dunball. It used Blue Lias stone quarried at several locations in the village, transported to the works on narrow-gauge railways. This area of the Polden Hills was used for quarrying stone and lime burning from 1888 until 1973. Quarrying may have taken place on the hillside as early as the 15th century.

In 1910 exploration for coal discovered a thick seam of Rock salt beneath the mudstones. Between 1911 and 1922 this was commercially extracted by dissolving the salt with water pumped down bore holes, which was brought to the surface and evaporated in boiling pans.

Until just after World War II the village still had apple and pear orchards. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as growing pears (1086 – &quot;Peritone&quot; &#x27;a Pear Orchard or farmstead where Pear trees grow&#x27;) and this is one possible reason for the village&#x27;s name. A German pilot was captured in one of the orchards after his plane was shot down and he landed by parachute. The orchards have now all gone, houses having been built on them. The last was &quot;Culverhay&quot;, which at one time had housed both a dairy and a cider press. One working farm is still in existence.

In 1941, ROF Bridgwater, an explosives factory, was opened midway between Puriton and the adjacent village of Woolavington. The factory lies mostly in Puriton parish, with a small portion in Woolavington. Several million gallons of water per day were extracted from the nearby artificial River Huntspill. Now the extraction rate is probably very much lower, and most, if not all, of the water is returned after use, after clean-up through a reedbed sewage treatment plant. A large explosion occurred at the factory in the early 1950s, with workers dying or being injured. Its current owners, BAE Systems Land and Armaments, closed it in spring 2008.
Part of this site, now known as Gravity, has today (19 July 2023), been confirmed to be a new factory for TATA, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, to build batteries for electric vehicles.

The village&#x27;s stone quarries began to go out of use during World War II. The cement and lime works, next to both the King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain and the Bristol and Exeter Railway line, became run down by the early 1960s and was demolished when the M5 motorway was built through part of the site. The church, and the boundary walls, in the old part of the village, are built of blue lias blocks. &quot;Puriton Park&quot; was built over part of the site of an in-filled blue lias quarry, at the eastern end of the village.

The headquarters of the British Institute for Brain Injured Children (&quot;BIBIC&quot;), has been in a former 19th century house, Knowle Hall, since 1983.

==Governance==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the village comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District. 

The village is part of the &#x27;Puriton and Woolavington&#x27; electoral ward. This ward stretches from the River Parrett in the west to Cossington in the east. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,647.

It is part of the Bridgwater county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system.

The northern end of King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain, where it discharges into the River Parrett, lies just outside the parish boundary; it runs between the Polden Hills (to the east) and the M5 motorway (to the west).
In Roman times the course of the River Parrett near the village was very different. It had an almost-complete great loop that followed the southern flank of the Polden Hills, along the course of the present-day King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain. Roman ships were able to dock in the lee of the Polden Hills.

Until the mid-19th century, the main road from Exeter to Bristol, via Crandon Bridge, passed through the village in front (east) of the &quot;Puriton Inn&quot; and continued along what is now Pawlett Road / Puriton Road to Pawlett and beyond. The Exeter — Bristol road is now part of the A38: and the arrow-straight section north from Bridgwater to Pawlett was built in the 1820s. It bypassed Pawlett; the old road is now known as the &quot;Old Main Road&quot;.

The village was served by a railway station at Dunball, opened in 1873 by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, downgraded to Dunball Halt by the British Transport Commission in 1961. It closed in November 1964 and has been completely removed, although the line remains open, with Bridgwater as the nearest station.

With the building of the 19th-century section of the A38, the old main road from Crandon Bridge through the village to Pawlett was retained. The southern section from Crandon Bridge up the Polden Hill is part of the A39 link road to the M5 motorway. Part of the northern section was realigned in 1973, when the M5 motorway was extended through Somerset: it was diverted to the west of the &quot;Puriton Inn&quot; to roundabout at junction 23. Parts of the original route still exist as two sections of Puriton Hill and most of Puriton Road. Hall Road, Puriton, was built at the same time to link the A39 to Riverton Road, Puriton. The road between Riverton Road / Puriton Hill and Puriton Road / Downend Road was severed by the M5, being replaced by a footbridge to the hamlet of Downend. Church Field Lane was also severed by the M5. A dual carriageway was built between the M5 roundabout and a new roundabout on the A38 at Dunball, with a link road to Downend.

The village is immediately east of Junction 23 of the M5 (Dunball is immediately to the west), accessed from the A39. The A38, &quot;Bristol road&quot;, is just over a mile away, beyond the M5 roundabout.

==Religious sites==
The Anglican parish Church of St Michael and All Angels was constructed from local Blue Lias stone. It has an early-13th-century tower, with the remainder dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. It has been designated a Grade I listed building.

==Puriton Party in the Park==
Puriton hosts its own Party in the Park. It has been run annually since 2010 and takes place in the middle of August, typically from 2-10pm. The afternoon session from 2-6pm hosts a variety of stalls, rides and games for children and an arena in the field where groups from the village and beyond are invited to perform. The evening session from 6-10pm turns the field into a music concert, allowing local bands and artists the chance to perform on a lorry that has been transformed into a stage. The year 2014 saw Michael Eavis open the evening&#x27;s entertainment, alongside Puriton&#x27;s own Dolly Pardon (a spoof of the finale act from Glastonbury Festival 2014, Dolly Parton).

<doc id="255834" wikidata="Q2599591" url="?curid=255834" title="Honō no Tenkōsei">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kazuhiko Shimamoto. It was serialized in the Shogakukan manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from 1983 to 1985. &quot;Honō no Tenkōsei&quot; was adapted into a two-episode original video animation (OVA) anime series in 1991 by Gainax. A live-action series, titled Blazing Transfer Students, premiered on Netflix in 2017.

==Plot==
Noboru Takizawa transfers to a school where all disputes are settled through fighting. He quickly runs afoul of the school bully, Saburō Ibuki, who has a boxing match with &quot;God&#x27;s Hall Monitor&quot;, Kōichi Jōnouchi, to determine who will date the lovely Yukari. Takizawa is enraptured with Yukari, and decides to intervene in the fight which Ibuki won by bending the rules. Takizawa loses the fight in the first OVA to Ibuki&#x27;s deadly finishing punch, but in the second OVA Takizawa develops his own finishing punch and eventually wins the day.

==Media==
===Manga===
&quot;Honō no Tenkōsei&quot;, written and illustrated by Kazuhiko Shimamoto, was serialized in the Shogakukan magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from July 20, 1983, to November 13, 1985. The individual chapters were collected in twelve &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, released from February 18, 1984, to January 18, 1986.

===OVA===
&quot;Honō no Tenkōsei&quot; was adapted into a two-episode original video animation (OVA) anime produced by Gainax. The anime reunites director Katsuhiko Nishijima and character designer Yuji Moriyama of the original &quot;Project A-ko&quot; and features storyboards by Sumio Watanabe. The OVA features an opening vocal theme written by Shimamoto Kazuhiko, arranged by Kohei Tanaka, and performed by Toshihiko Seki. The ending theme, , was composed and arranged by Tanaka and performed by Noriko Hidaka. The &quot;Honō no Tenkōsei&quot; OVA parodies anime of the 1970s, particularly &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Joe&quot;, and is complete with intentionally jerky animation, dirty-looking cels, thick black lines, and retro character designs, much like Shimamoto&#x27;s drawing style.

According to Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post &quot;Honō no Tenkōsei&quot; was released on both VHS and laserdisc, but not DVD. It was released on Blu-ray by Pony Canyon on March 19, 2014.

===Live-action series===
A Netflix original live-action series called &quot;Blazing Transfer Students&quot; or &quot;Honō no Tenkōsei REBORN&quot; was released as a sequel set years after the original story. The story revolves around seven students all named Kakeru who transfer into the school. It was released on November 10, 2017, and was directed by Toshio Lee.

==Reception==
As of March 2017, the manga had over 1.6 million copies in circulation.

Anime News Network&#x27;s Justin Sevakis, commenting on the anime, said that &quot;while the animation has that slightly soft shot-on-film look, the heightened contrast and angular designs that were meant to evoke the past have instead kept it looking modern.&quot;

<doc id="255835" wikidata="Q332179" url="?curid=255835" title="Price skimming">
<text>Price skimming is a price strategy where a marketer initially offers an item at a high price so that consumers with the strongest desire and funds to purchase it will, and then as that demand is depleted the price gets lowered to the next layer of customer desire in the market.

A company can use price skimming when launching a product or service for the first time. By following this price skimming method and capturing the extra profit, a firm is able to recoup its sunk costs quicker as well as profit off of a higher price in the market before new competition enters and lowers the market price. It has become a relatively common practice for managers in new and growing market, introducing prices high and dropping them over time.

Price skimming is sometimes referred to as &quot;riding down the demand curve&quot;. The objective of a price skimming strategy is to capture the consumer surplus early in the product life cycle in order to exploit a monopolistic position or the low price sensitivity of innovators.

The skimming strategy gets its name from skimming successive layers of &quot;cream&quot;, or customer segments, off the top of the market, as prices are lowered over time.

== Examples ==
There are many real world examples of price skimming, especially in the technology market.

* Sony&#x27;s console, the Sony Playstation 3, initially launched in 2006 for $599 in the United States. Over the release of competitor consoles (Xbox 360, Wii) and the release of next generation consoles (Sony Playstation 4 in 2013 and Sony Playstation 5 in 2020) the Playstation 3 price was gradually reduced and can now be purchased for under $200.

== Limitations of price skimming ==

There are several potential problems with this strategy. 
* It is effective only when the firm is facing an inelastic demand curve. If the long-run demand curve is elastic (as in the adjacent diagram), market equilibrium will be achieved by quantity changes rather than price changes. Penetration pricing is a more suitable strategy in this case. Price changes by any one firm will be matched by other firms resulting in a rapid growth in industry volume. Dominant market share will typically be obtained by a low cost producer that pursues a penetration strategy.
* A price skimmer must be careful with the law. Price discrimination (the same seller offering the same product at different prices to different groups) is illegal in many jurisdictions, but yield management is not. Price skimming can be considered either a form of price discrimination or a form of yield management. Price discrimination uses market characteristics (such as price elasticity) to adjust prices, whereas yield management uses product characteristics. Marketers see this legal distinction as quaint since in almost all cases market characteristics correlate highly with product characteristics. If using a skimming strategy, a marketer must speak and think in terms of product characteristics to stay on the right side of the law.
* The inventory turn rate can be very low for skimmed products. This could cause problems for the manufacturer&#x27;s distribution chain. It may be necessary to give retailers higher margins to convince them to handle the product enthusiastically.
* Price skimming can attract more competition to the market due to firms intrigued by the high price margins and introducing their own product, also eroding the inelasticity of the demand curve.
* Skimming results in a slower rate of product diffusion and adoption. This results in a higher level of untapped demand, giving competitors time to either imitate the product or leapfrog it with an innovation. If competitors do this, the window of opportunity will have been lost. The slower rate of adoption can also have an effect on brand loyalty as fewer customers get their hands on or are aware of the item being sold. 
* The manufacturer could develop negative publicity if they lower the price too fast and without significant product changes. Some early purchasers will feel they have been ripped off. They will feel it would have been better to wait and purchase the product at a much lower price. This negative sentiment will be transferred to the brand and the company as a whole.
* High margins may make the firm inefficient. There will be less incentive to keep costs under control. Inefficient practices will become established making it difficult to compete on value or price.
*The lower quantity demand for the item may mean a firm can not take advantage of economies of scale. 

==Reasons for price skimming==

When considering a relatively new product with a limited supply and a short life cycle, price skimming can be introduced as a strategy during the first stage of the product life cycle, because some customers want to be the first to buy the product and are willing to pay the premium. Then the price will go down after a certain selling period, which is also referred to as market exit time.

Price skimming occurs for example in the luxury car and consumer electronics markets. In consumer electronics, there is a confounding factor that there is typically high price deflation due to continual reductions in manufacturing cost and improvements in product quality - for example, a printer priced at $200 today would have sold for a far higher price a decade ago.

The book market often combines price skimming with product versioning in the following way: a new book is published in hardback at a high price; if the book sells well it is subsequently published in paperback at a much reduced price (far lower than the difference in cost of the binding) to more price-sensitive customers. The hardback usually continues to be sold in parallel to those consumers and libraries, that have a strong preference for hardbacks.

== Research ==
In an empirical study, Martin Spann, Marc Fischer and Gerard Tellis analyze the prevalence and choice of dynamic pricing strategies in a highly complex branded market, consisting of 663 products under 79 brand names of digital cameras. They find that, despite numerous recommendations in the literature for skimming or penetration pricing, market pricing dominates in practice. In particular, the authors find five patterns: skimming (20% frequency), penetration (20% frequency), and three variants of market-pricing patterns (60% frequency), where new products are launched at market prices. Skimming pricing launches the new product 16% above the market price and subsequently lowers the price relative to the market price. Penetration pricing launches the new product 18% below the market price and subsequently increases the price relative to the market price. Firms exhibit a mix of these pricing paths across their portfolios. The specific pricing paths correlate with market, firm, and brand characteristics such as competitive intensity, market pioneering, brand reputation, and experience effects.

<text>William Kraft (September 6, 1923 – February 12, 2022) was an American composer, conductor, teacher, timpanist, and percussionist.

==Biography==
===Early life and education (1923–1954)===
Kraft was born in Chicago, Illinois. He was awarded two Anton Seidl Fellowships at Columbia University, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree cum laude in 1951 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1954. He studied composition with Jack Beeson and Henry Cowell, orchestration with Henry Brant, percussion with Morris Goldenberg, timpani from Saul Goodman, and conducting with Rudolph Thomas and Fritz Zweig.

While in New York City, Kraft worked as a freelance musician and was an extra percussionist at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1954, Kraft joined the Dallas Symphony. After one season, he accepted a position as percussionist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

===At the Los Angeles Philharmonic (1955–1985)===
Kraft began as a member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic&#x27;s percussion section, before being promoted to the orchestra&#x27;s principal timpanist. From 1968 to 1972, he also served as the orchestra&#x27;s assistant conductor, under then music director Zubin Mehta. From 1981 to 1985, Kraft was Composer-in-Residence for the orchestra; during that period he founded and directed its New Music Group. Altogether he spent 26 years with the Philharmonic.

In 1958, Kraft founded the Los Angeles Percussion Ensemble, a group which made its debut on March 10 with the Monday Evening Concerts. The group performed the world and local premieres of works by Alberto Ginastera, Lou Harrison, Ernst Krenek, Igor Stravinsky, Edgard Varèse, and other composers. He performed in the local premiere of Pierre Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Le marteau sans maître&quot; under the composer&#x27;s direction and played the American premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zyklus&quot;. The latter led to a journalistic debate between Los Angeles Times music critic Albert Goldberg and Kraft, who took exception to the critic&#x27;s use of the term &quot;noisemakers&quot; in reference to percussion instruments.

He has also composed film soundtracks, including the scores to &quot;Psychic Killer&quot; (1975), &quot;Avalanche&quot; (1978), &quot;Bill&quot; (1981), and &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (1983).

===Later years===
Kraft served as chairman of the composition department and holder of the Corwin Chair at the University of California, Santa Barbara until he retired in June 2002.

Kraft died on February 12, 2022, at the age of 98.

==Commissions and awards==
* Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards Second Prize (1984) : Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra
* Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards First Prize (1990) : Veils and Variations for Horns and Orchestra
* Hall of Fame of the Percussive Arts Society (1990)
* American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers Award

==Compositions==
In the 1960s and 1970s, most of Kraft&#x27;s compositions were serial, while in the 1980s he incorporated jazz rhythms and impressionist harmonies. Although percussion works feature prominently in his catalog, in 1996–1998 he concentrated on composing his first opera, &quot;Red Azalea&quot;. His works have been performed by many major American orchestras as well as those in Europe, Japan, Korea, China, Australia, Israel, and the USSR. Kraft&#x27;s &quot;Contextures: Riots – Decade &#x27;60&quot; (1967) has been choreographed and performed by both the Scottish National Ballet and the Minnesota Dance Company. In 1986, United Airlines commissioned a work expressly to accompany a lumetric sculpture by Michael Hayden titled &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot;, for their pedestrian passageway at Chicago-O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

==Recordings==
Compact discs completely devoted to Kraft&#x27;s music can be found on Harmonia Mundi, CRI, Cambria, Crystal, Albany, and Nonesuch labels. Other works can be found on GM, Crystal, London Decca, Townhall, EMI, and Neuma. Recent works include &quot;Brazen&quot;, commissioned by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra; &quot;Quintessence Revisited&quot; and Concerto for Four Percussion Soloists and Symphonic Wind Ensemble, premiered and recorded by the New England Conservatory Wind Ensemble, Frank Battisti conducting. His &quot;Encounter&quot; solo series has been recorded multiple times on all appropriate instruments. On &quot;Encounters&quot;, he worked with guitarist John Schneider. &quot;Encounters II&quot; showcases unique techniques for tuba such as multiphonics double pedal range. In 2010, the Los Angeles Philharmonic released a recording on DG Concerts of the Timpani Concerto No. 1 featuring Joseph Pereira as soloist with John Adams conducting.

<text>The National Gallery of Australia (NGA), formerly the Australian National Gallery, is the national art museum of Australia as well as one of the largest art museums in Australia, holding more than 166,000 works of art. Located in Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory, it was established in 1967 by the Australian Government as a national public art museum. it is under the directorship of Nick Mitzevich.

== Establishment ==
Prominent Australian artist Tom Roberts had lobbied various Australian prime ministers, starting with the first, Edmund Barton. Prime Minister Andrew Fisher accepted the idea in 1910, and the following year Parliament established a bipartisan committee of six political leaders—the &quot;Historic Memorials Committee&quot;. The Committee decided that the government should collect portraits of Australian governors-general, parliamentary leaders and the principal &quot;fathers&quot; of federation to be painted by Australian artists. This led to the establishment of what became known as the &quot;Commonwealth Art Advisory Board&quot;, which was responsible for art acquisitions until 1973. Nevertheless, the &quot;Parliamentary Library Committee&quot; also collected paintings for the Australian collections of the &quot;Commonwealth Parliamentary Library&quot;, including landscapes, notably the acquisition of Tom Roberts&#x27; &quot;Allegro con brio, Bourke St West&quot; in 1918. Prior to the opening of the Gallery these paintings were displayed around Parliament House, in Commonwealth offices, including diplomatic missions overseas, and State Galleries.

From 1912, the building of a permanent building to house the collection in Canberra was the major priority of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board. However, this period included two World Wars and a Depression and governments always considered they had more pressing priorities, including building the initial infrastructure of Canberra and Old Parliament House in the 1920s and the rapid expansion of Canberra and the building of government offices, Lake Burley Griffin and the National Library of Australia in the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1965 the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board was finally able to persuade Prime Minister Robert Menzies to take the steps necessary to establish the gallery. On 1 November 1967, Prime Minister Harold Holt formally announced that the Government would construct the building.

=== Location ===
The design of the building was complicated by the difficulty in finalising its location, which was affected by the layout of the Parliamentary Triangle. The main problem was the final site of the new Parliament House. In Canberra&#x27;s original Griffin 1912 plan, Parliament House was to be built on Camp Hill, between Capital Hill and the Provisional Parliament House and a &quot;Capitol&quot; was to be built on top of Capital Hill. He envisaged the Capitol to be &quot;either a general administration structure for popular receptions and ceremony or for housing archives and commemorating Australian Achievements&quot;. In the early 1960s, the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) proposed, in accordance with the 1958 and 1964 Holford plans for the Parliamentary Triangle, that the site for the new Parliament House be moved to the shore of Lake Burley Griffin, with a vast &quot;National Place&quot;, to be built on its south side, to be surrounded by a large mass of buildings. The Gallery would be built on Capital Hill, along with other national cultural institutions.

In 1968, Colin Madigan of Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Partners won the competition for the design, even though no design could be finalised, as the final site was now in doubt. Prime Minister John Gorton stated that,
:&quot;The Competition had as its aim not a final design for the building but rather the selection of a vigorous and imaginative architect who would then be commissioned to submit the actual design of the Gallery.&quot;

Gorton proposed to Parliament in 1968 that it endorse Holford&#x27;s lakeside site for the new Parliament House, but it refused and sites at Camp Hill and Capital Hill were then investigated. As a result, the Government decided that the Gallery could not be built on Capital Hill. In 1971, the Government selected a site on the eastern side of the proposed &quot;National Place&quot;, between King Edward Terrace and for the Gallery. Even though it was now unlikely that the lakeside Parliament House would proceed, a raised &quot;National Place&quot; (to hide parking stations) surrounded by national institutions and government offices was still planned. Madigan&#x27;s brief included the Gallery, a building for the High Court of Australia and the precinct around them, linking to the raised &quot;National Place&quot; at the centre of the Land Axis of the Parliamentary Triangle, which then led to the National Library on the western side.

===Development of the design===
Madigan&#x27;s final design was based on a brief prepared by the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) with input from James Johnson Sweeney and James Mollison. Sweeney was director of the Guggenheim Museum between 1952–1960 and director of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and had been appointed as a consultant to advise on issues concerning the display and storage of art. Mollison said in 1989 that &quot;the size and form of the building had been determined between Colin Madigan and J.J. Sweeney, and the National Capital Development Commission. I was not able to alter the appearance of the interior or exterior in any way...It&#x27;s a very difficult building in which to make art look more important than the space in which you put the art&quot;. The construction of the building commenced in 1973, with the unveiling of a plaque by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Construction was managed by P.D.C. Constructions under the supervision of the National Capital Development Commission and it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1982, during the premiership of Whitlam&#x27;s successor, Malcolm Fraser. The building cost $82 million.

In 1975, the NCDC abandoned the plan for the &quot;National Place&quot;, leaving the precinct five metres above the natural ground level, without the previously proposed connections to national institutions and next to a vast space only partially taken up by Reconciliation Place, which does not substitute for the grand mass of buildings originally envisaged.

===Appointment of an acting director===

The Commonwealth Art Advisory Board recommended that Laurie Thomas, a former director of the Art Gallery of Western Australia and of the Queensland Art Gallery be appointed director, but the Prime Minister John Gorton took no action on this recommendation, as he apparently favoured the appointment of James Johnson Sweeney, although he was already 70.

James Mollison was exhibitions officer in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department from 1969 and the Government&#x27;s failure to appoint a director of the National Gallery of Australia required Mollison to become involved in the development of the design for the building with the architects led by Colin Madigan. In November 1970, the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board recommended that he should be re-designated as assistant director (development). In May 1971, following Gorton&#x27;s fall from power, the Government endorsed Madigan&#x27;s sketches for the building. The new prime minister, William McMahon announced the appointment of Mollison as acting director of the National Gallery of Australia in October 1971. Tenders for construction were called in November 1972, just before the McMahon government&#x27;s defeat in the December 1972 election.

== Building and garden==

The National Gallery building is in the late 20th-century Brutalist style. It is characterised by angular masses and raw concrete surfaces and is surrounded by a series of sculpture gardens planted with Australian native plants and trees.

The geometry of the building is based on a triangle, most obviously manifested for visitors in the coffered ceiling grids and tiles of the principal floor. Madigan said of this device that it was &quot;the intention of the architectural concept to implant into the grammar of the design a sense of freedom so that the building could be submitted to change and variety but would always express its true purpose&quot;. This geometry flows throughout the building, and is reflected in the triangular stair towers, columns and building elements.

The building is principally constructed of reinforced bush hammered concrete, which was also originally the interior wall surface. More recently, the interior walls have been covered with painted wood, to allow for increased flexibility in the display of artworks.

The building has 23,000 m2 of floor space. The design provides space for both the display and storage of works of art and to accommodate the curatorial and support staff of the Gallery. Madigan&#x27;s design is based on Sweeney&#x27;s recommendation that there should be a spiral plan, with a succession of galleries to display works of art of differing sizes and to allow flexibility in the way in which they were to be exhibited.

There are three levels of galleries. On the principal floor, the galleries are large, and are used to display the Indigenous Australian and International (meaning European and American) collections. The bottom level also contains a series of large galleries, originally intended to house sculpture, but now used to display the Asian art collection. The topmost level contains a series of smaller, more intimate galleries, which are now used to display the Gallery&#x27;s collection of Australian art. Sweeney had recommended that sources of natural light should not detract from the collections, and so light sources are intended to be indirect.

The High Court and National Gallery Precinct were added to the Australian National Heritage List in November 2007.

===Later extensions===
The Gallery has been extended twice, the first of which was the building of new temporary exhibition galleries on the eastern side of the building in 1997, to house large-scale temporary exhibitions, which was designed by Andrew Andersons of PTW Architects. This extension includes a sculptural garden, designed by Fiona Hall. The 2006 enhancement project and new entrance was complemented by a large Australian Garden designed by Adrian McGregor of McGregor Coxall Landscape Architecture and Urban Design.

There have also been proposals, during the tenure of Director Brian Kennedy, for the construction of a new &quot;front&quot; entrance, facing King Edward Terrace. Madigan made known his concerns about these proposals and their interference with his moral rights as the architect and also expressed concerns about these changes. A former director, Betty Churcher, was particularly critical of Madigan, and told a journalist that &quot;the dead hand of an architect cannot stay clamped on a building forever&quot;. When Ron Radford became director, he expanded the brief to include a suite of new galleries to display the collection of indigenous art and a new Australian Garden fronting King Edward Terrace.

The Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, announced on 13 December 2006 that the Australian Government would provide $92.9 million for a major building enhancement project at the National Gallery of Australia, including around $20 million for previously approved building refurbishments. The building enhancements were designed to create new arrival and entrance facilities to improve public access to the Gallery&#x27;s building and significantly increase display space, particularly for the collection of Australian Indigenous art. Stage 1 of the Indigenous galleries and new entrance project was officially opened on 30 September 2010 by Quentin Bryce, Governor-General of Australia. According to well-known architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly, the new extension had three main tasks: &quot;how to dock amicably with the existing architecture; how to provide the resulting whole with a new street &quot;address&quot;; how to create a logical, legible and deferential hanging space for the collection.&quot;

===Sculpture garden renewal and Ouroboros===

A project for the renewal of the sculpture garden was under way as of 2021. As part of the project, in September 2021 the gallery under director Nick Mitzevich commissioned a huge sculpture by Lindy Lee, high and based on the ouroboros (an ancient symbol depicting a snake eating its own tail), to be placed near its main entrance of the gallery. Unveiled in October 2024, the sculpture is the NGA&#x27;s most expensive commission to date. Two art critics criticised the purchase in 2021: John McDonald of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; thought that the money could have been better spent filling some significant gaps in its collection, while Christopher Allen concurred, and thought that it merely &quot;offer[s] a passive experience to audiences who are unwilling or unable to engage more actively with works of art&quot; and that &quot;$14m is an absurd price for a work of debatable value by an artist of modest standing&quot;.

== Directorship ==
In 1976, the newly established ANG Council advertised for a permanent director to fill the position that James Mollison had been acting in since 1971. The new prime minister Malcolm Fraser announced the appointment of Mollison as director in 1977.

===James Mollison===
James Mollison is notable for establishing the Gallery and building on the collection that had already been assembled of mainly Australian paintings by purchasing icons of modern western art, the best known were the 1974 purchases of &quot;Blue Poles&quot; by Jackson Pollock ($1.3m), and &quot;Woman V&quot; by Willem de Kooning ($650,000). These purchases were very controversial at the time, but are now generally considered to be visionary acquisitions.

He also built up the other collections, often with the help of donations. Starting in 1973 Mollison secured funding from Philip Morris to acquire contemporary Australian photography for the ANG, though Ian North was not appointed Foundation Curator of Photography until 1980. In 1975, Arthur Boyd presented several thousand of his works to the Gallery. In 1977 Mollison persuaded Sunday Reed to donate Sidney Nolan&#x27;s remarkable Ned Kelly series to the ANG. Nolan had long disputed Reed&#x27;s ownership of these paintings, but the donation resolved their dispute. In 1981, Albert Tucker and his wife presented a substantial collection of Tucker&#x27;s collection to the Gallery. As a result of these and more recent donation, it has the finest collection of Australian art in existence.

He also arranged many touring exhibitions, most famously &quot;The Great Impressionist Exhibition&quot; of 1984.

His successor, Betty Churcher has said that when she took over in 1990, he &quot;was of almost legendary stature [and] had single-handedly built a great and comprehensive collection from the ground up; indeed he had presided over the collection for more than twenty years with great flair, and over the institution for seven years — it was in the truest sense, his Gallery, his professional achievement.&quot;

===Betty Churcher===
Betty Churcher became director in 1990. She had been formerly director of the Art Gallery of Western Australia. While director of the National Gallery, she was dubbed &quot;Betty Blockbuster&quot; because of her love of blockbuster exhibitions.

Churcher initiated the building of new galleries on the eastern side of the building, opened in March 1998, to house large-scale temporary exhibitions. It was under her directorship that the name of the Gallery was changed from the Australian National Gallery to its current title.

During her period, the Gallery purchased, among many other artworks, &quot;Golden Summer, Eaglemont&quot; by Arthur Streeton for $3.5 million. This was the last great Heidelberg School painting still in private hands.

===Brian Kennedy===
Brian Kennedy was appointed director in 1997. He expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site. On the other hand, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Churcher, of showing &quot;blockbuster&quot; exhibitions.

During his directorship, the National Gallery of Australia gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. Private funding supported his notable acquisitions of David Hockney&#x27;s &quot;A Bigger Grand Canyon&quot; for $4.6 million in 1999, Lucian Freud&#x27;s &quot;After Cézanne&quot; for $7.4 million in 2001 and &quot;Pregnant Woman&quot; by Ron Mueck for $800,000.

He also introduced free admission to the gallery, except to major exhibitions. He campaigned for the construction of a new &quot;front&quot; entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, but this did not come to pass during his tenure.

Kennedy&#x27;s cancellation of the Sensation exhibition (scheduled at the National Gallery of Australia from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, as it was seen by many as censorship. This exhibition was created by the Young British Artists of the Saatchi Gallery. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili&#x27;s &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot;, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then Mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was &quot;Catholic-bashing&quot; and an &quot;aggressive vicious, disgusting attack on religion.&quot; In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had &quot;obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art.&quot;

Kennedy was also repeatedly under attack over allegations that the air-conditioning was exposing its staff to cancer. Despite his denials that there was any problem with the air-conditioning, claims that the issue had been &#x27;swept under the carpet&#x27; persisted. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced that he would not seek extension of his contract in 2002. He has denied that he was under any government pressure to do so.

===Ron Radford===
Ron Radford was appointed director in late 2004. He was formerly director of the Art Gallery of South Australia.

Radford has lent out the Gallery&#x27;s old masters collection (European art, prior to the 19th century) for long-term display to state galleries, noting that he &quot;considers the collection of less than 30 paintings, put together by Mollison to give context to the modern collection, as too small to make any impact on the public&quot;. He has been quoted as saying that the gallery should concentrate on its strengths – European art of the first half of the 20th century, 20th-century American art, photography, Asian art and the 20th-century drawing collection, and to fill the gaps in the Australian collection.

In September 2005, there was considerable publicity about an offer to the gallery of &quot;Sketch for Deluge II&quot; by Wassily Kandinsky for $35 million. The gallery did not subsequently go through with the purchase.

Radford has been notable in securing funding and completing the building of the new entrance to the Gallery as well as an extension for Indigenous galleries, public and function areas. In developing the collection he has been notable for a series of acquisitions of indigenous art, in particular the largest collection of watercolours by Albert Namatjira and the James Turrell sculpture and installation &quot;&quot; (2010).

===Gerard Vaughan===
In October 2014, it was announced that Gerard Vaughan would be the new director of the National Gallery of Australia from 10 November. He was formerly director of the National Gallery of Victoria from 1999 to 2012.

In 2014, the gallery sued antiquities dealer Subhash Kapoor in New York Supreme Court for allegedly hiding evidence that an 11th-century sculpture of Shiva Nataraja known as the Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol, bought by the gallery for A$5.6 million in 2008, had been stolen from an Indian temple in Tamil Nadu. The National Gallery voluntarily removed a bronze statue of the Dancing Shiva from display, as the Indian government formally requested the statue&#x27;s return.

===Nick Mitzevich===
In April 2018, it was announced that Nick Mitzevich, the third NGA director to be appointed from the Art Gallery of South Australia, would take over at the start of July 2018. His term at the NGA has encountered several challenges: in January 2020 the gallery had to be shut because of smoke from bushfires and then again after a hailstorm. A couple of months later, the Covid pandemic struck, leading to a closure of over 70 days. In January 2021, Mitzevich had plans to re-hang the permanent collection, swapping the location of international art with that of Australian art.

== Controversies ==
In February 2025, the gallery ordered Palestinian flags to be covered up on an artwork displayed as part of the &quot;Te Paepae Aora’i – Where the Gods Cannot be Fooled&quot; exhibition. The artists stated they had reluctantly complied with the gallery&#x27;s direction on threat of the work being removed, and described it as &quot;censorship&quot;.

== Exhibitions and initiatives==

===&quot;Women Hold Up Half The Sky&quot;===

&quot;Women Hold Up Half The Sky&quot; was a large exhibition held in March to April 1995, to celebrate International Women&#x27;s Day. Named after Adelaide artist Ann Newmarch&#x27;s famous print of the same name included in the exhibition, the exhibition was curated by Roger Butler. It was opened by Carmen Lawrence, and also included a travelling exhibition called &quot;Sydney by Design&quot;. The exhibition was part of the national commemoration of the UN&#x27;s International Women&#x27;s Year, and the accompanying book, &quot;The National Women&#x27;s Art Book&quot;, was edited by Joan Kerr.

Comprising around 300 works from the gallery&#x27;s own collection, the exhibition included the work of Agnes Goodsir, Bessie Davidson, Clarice Beckett, Olive Cotton, Grace Cossington Smith, Yvonne Audette, Janet Dawson, Lesley Dumbrell, Margaret Worth, Rosalie Gascoigne, Bea Maddock, Judy Watson, Frances Burke, Margaret Preston, Olive Ashworth, and other artists of the previous 150 years.

===&quot;The Painters of the Wagilag Sisters story 1937-1997&quot;===
The exhibition &quot;The Painters of the Wagilag Sisters story 1937-1997&quot; was a major exhibition of the work of more than 100 Aboriginal artists held in 1997, curated by Nigel Lendon and Tim Bonyhady. The artists were Yolngu painters from Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, including senior member of the Rirratjingu clan Mawalan Marika as well as Ramingining artist Philip Gudthaykudthay (aka &quot;Pussycat&quot;). The artworks all related to the story of ancestral creator beings of Arnhem Land known as the Wagilag sisters.

===National Indigenous Art Triennial===
The NGA held the inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial (NIAT), &quot;Culture Warriors&quot;, from 13 October 2007 to 10 February 2008. The guest curator was Brenda L Croft, Senior Curator, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art. The exhibition was the largest survey show of Indigenous art at the NGA in over 15 years, and featured works by selected artists created during the previous three years. A free exhibition, it featured artists from every state and territory.

The 2nd National Indigenous Art Triennial, &quot;unDISCLOSED&quot;, ran from May to July 2012 and featured 20 Indigenous artists, including Vernon Ah Kee, Julie Gough, Alick Tipoti, Christian Thompson, Lena Yarinkura, Michael Cook and Nyapanyapa Yunupingu. The theme alludes to &quot;the spoken and the unspoken, the known and the unknown, what can be revealed and what cannot&quot;. The exhibition afterwards toured the country, shown at Cairns Regional Gallery, the Anne &amp; Gordon Samstag Museum of Art in Adelaide and the Western Plains Cultural Centre in Dubbo, NSW.

The 3rd National Indigenous Art Triennial, &quot;Defying Empire&quot;, was held from 26 May to 10 September 2017, curated by Tina Baum, NGA Curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art. The title references the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, that recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as Australians for the first time.

The 4th Triennial &quot;Ceremony&quot;, takes place from 26 March to 31 July 2022. It explores the idea of ceremony, and is curated by Hetti Perkins.

===Balnaves Contemporary Series===

In 2018 the Balnaves Contemporary Intervention Series was launched, delivered in partnership with the Balnaves Foundation. The platform, later renamed to Balnaves Contemporary Series, commissions artists to create new work. Artists commissioned by this project include Jess Johnson and Simon Ward (2018); Sarah Contos (2018); Patricia Piccinini (&quot;Skywhales&quot;, 2020–21); Judy Watson and Helen Johnson; and Daniel Crooks (2022).

===&quot;Know My Name&quot;===
&quot;Know My Name&quot; is &quot;an initiative of the National Gallery of Australia to celebrate the significant contributions of Australian women artists&quot;. Launched in 2019, after it was discovered that only 25 per cent of the gallery&#x27;s collection was made by women through information from the Countess Report. This exhibition features exhibitions, events, commissions, creative collaborations, publications and partnerships that highlight the talent and work of women artists. As part of the program, the NGA also instigated a new set of principles to ensure gender parity in the organisation, programming and collections.

The exhibition &quot;Know My Name: Australian Women Artists 1900 to Now: Part One&quot;, held from 14 Nov 2020 to 9 May 2021, featured art made by women, drawn from the NGA&#x27;s own collection as well as other institutions around Australia. Featured artists included Margaret Olley, Yvonne Koolmatrie, Tracey Moffatt, Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Mabel Juli, Rosemary Laing, Grace Cossington Smith, Thea Proctor, Betty Muffler, Stella Bowen, Dora Chapman, Fiona Foley, Brenda L. Croft, Discount Universe and many others. A book entitled &quot;Know My Name&quot; was published to accompany the exhibition in 2020. A four-day conference was held to coincide with the exhibition&#x27;s opening.

&quot;Know My Name: Australian Women Artists 1900 to Now: Part Two&quot; was opened on 12 June 2021 and finishes on 26 June 2022. The two exhibitions do not purport to be a complete account, but rather &quot;[look] at moments in which women created new forms of art and cultural commentary such as feminism... [highlighting] creative and intellectual relationships between artists across time&quot;.

=== &quot;Body Sculpture&quot;===
In 2020 the gallery purchased American artist Jordan Wolfson&#x27;s &quot;Cube&quot; for million, about half the museum&#x27;s annual acquisition budget. The final transport and installation of the work was then delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was finally unveiled in 2023. Renamed &quot;Body Sculpture&quot;, the robotic artwork is the first solo presentation of Wolfson&#x27;s work in Australia, and a world premiere of the work, which is on display alongside key works from the national collection selected by the artist from 9 December 2023 until 28 July 2024.

This collection is dominated by the &quot;Aboriginal Memorial&quot; of 200 painted tree trunks commemorating all the indigenous people who had died between 1788 and 1988 defending their land against invaders. Each tree trunk is a &quot;dupun&quot; or log coffin, which is used to mark the safe tradition of the soul of the deceased from this world to the next. Artists from Ramingining painted it to mark the Australian Bicentenary and it was accepted for display by the Biennale of Sydney in 1988. Mollison agreed to purchase it for permanent display before its completion.

<text>Sniffin&#x27; Glue and Other Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Habits..., widely known as simply Sniffin&#x27; Glue, was a monthly punk zine started by Mark Perry in July 1976 and released for about a year. The name is derived from a Ramones song &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue.&quot; Some of the zine&#x27;s writers, such as Danny Baker, later became well-known journalists.

Although initial issues only sold 50 copies, circulation soon increased to 15,000. The innovative appeal of &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; was its immediacy:


The early days of the punk movement largely failed to attract the attention of television or the mainstream press, and &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; was a key source of photographs of, and information about, contributors to the scene.

&quot;NME&quot; acclaimed &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; as &quot;the nastiest, healthiest and funniest piece of press in the history of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll habits&quot; and it became a chronicle of the early days of British punk rock as well as pioneering the DIY punk ethic. For the final issue Mark&#x27;s sidekick &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; photographer, business affairs and later band manager Harry Murlowski recorded &quot;Love Lies Limp&quot; released as a flexi disc record - the first release from Mark Perry&#x27;s band Alternative TV.

Fearing absorption into the mainstream music press, Perry ceased publication in 1977. In the last issues he encouraged his readers to follow him with their own punk fanzines.

&quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; is often incorrectly credited as the source of the illustration featuring drawings of three guitar chord shapes, captioned, &quot;this is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band&quot;, this drawing actually originally appeared in January 1977 in another fanzine &quot;Sideburns&quot; and was later reproduced in The Stranglers&#x27; fanzine &quot;Strangled&quot;.

In 2000, Mark Perry published &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue: The Essential Punk Accessory&quot;, which is a compilation of all the issues of the fanzine with some new material written by him.
&quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; is referenced in the song &quot;Three Sevens Clash&quot; by The Alarm, a tribute to 1977, and a follow on from their previous punk tribute &quot;45 RPM&quot;.

<text>Community Arts Music Association (CAMA) of Santa Barbara is the oldest arts organization in Santa Barbara, California, United States.

CAMA began in the fall of 1919 when a group of community-minded Santa Barbarans came together in the years following World War I to create the Civic Music Committee. Their goal was to present musical performances, beginning with the new Los Angeles Philharmonic, founded by philanthropist William Andrews Clark, Jr. that same year. The group&#x27;s work was taken over by the Community Arts Association&#x27;s Music Branch in 1926, which in time evolved into today&#x27;s Community Arts Music Association.

Since the 1920s, CAMA has presented such artists as Pablo Casals, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Vladimir Horowitz, Jascha Heifetz, Igor Stravinsky, Artur Schnabel, Isaac Stern and Marian Anderson, with yearly performances from the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Since the 1950s, the orchestra series has expanded and now includes concerts by a variety of orchestras, from the New York Philharmonic to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.

<text>William Andrews Clark Jr. (March 29, 1877 – June 14, 1934) was a Los Angeles–based philanthropist and the youngest surviving son of copper baron and U.S. Senator William Andrews Clark Sr. and his first wife, Katherine.

==Early life==
William Andrews Clark Jr. was born on March 29, 1877, in Deer Lodge, Montana. His father was William A. Clark and his mother was Katherine Louise Stauffer. He was educated in France and in the New York area and graduated from the University of Virginia with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law in 1899.

==Career and hobbies==
Clark was a partner in the law firm Clark &amp; Roote in Butte, Montana. He also served on the boards of several of his father&#x27;s mining and industrial concerns.

===Book collection===
In the mid-1910s, he began collecting antiquarian and fine press books as a serious hobby (he had dabbled in book buying previous to this). In 1919, he hired bibliographer Robert E. Cowan to consult on book-buying purchases and to help with the compilation of a printed library catalog. The first volume of this was printed in 1920 by San Francisco printer John Henry Nash.

===Philanthropy===
He founded the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which debuted in the Trinity Auditorium in 1919, and bequeathed his library of rare books and manuscripts, the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, to the University of California, Los Angeles upon his death in 1934. He also helped to fund the construction of the Hollywood Bowl.

==Personal life==
In 1902, he married Mabel Duffield Foster (1880–1903), who died of sepsis following the birth of their son William Andrews Clark III (&quot;Tertius&quot;) (1902–1932), who died in a plane crash in Arizona in 1932.

In 1907, he married Alice McManus (1883–1916), a native Nevadan, and they moved their permanent home to Los Angeles in the early 1910s (Clark County, Nevada is named for his father). Their house at Adams Boulevard and Cimarron Street occupied the grounds that the Clark Library is now located.

Clark also had romantic relationships with men. Notable among his lovers was Harrison Post, who co-transcribed Clark&#x27;s collection of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s letters to Lord Alfred Douglas. Clark also put Post in charge of the interior decoration of the Clark Library. According to library staff, the thirteen naked men painted on the library&#x27;s ornate ceiling all have Post&#x27;s face. Post lived in a mansion across from Clark&#x27;s on Cimarron Street and inherited a substantial trust fund on Clark&#x27;s death.
===Death===
He died on June 14, 1934, at Salmon Lake, Montana. He is entombed in the family mausoleum which he built on the island in Sylvan Lake at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Both of his wives and his son are also in the mausoleum.

<text>The LaserDisc (LD) is a home video format and the first commercial optical disc storage medium, initially licensed, sold and marketed as MCA DiscoVision (also known simply as &quot;DiscoVision&quot;) in the United States in 1978. Its diameter typically spans . Unlike most optical-disc standards, LaserDisc is not fully digital, and instead requires the use of analog video signals.

Although the format was capable of offering higher-quality video and audio than its consumer rivals, VHS and Betamax videotape, LaserDisc never managed to gain widespread use in North America. This was largely due to the high cost of the players and their inability to record TV programs. It eventually did gain some traction in that region and became mildly popular in the 1990s. It also saw a modest share of adoption in Australia and several European countries.

By contrast, the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, and was the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s. Its superior video and audio quality made it a popular choice among videophiles and film enthusiasts during its lifespan. The technologies and concepts behind LaserDisc were the foundation for later optical disc formats, including Compact Disc (CD), DVD, and Blu-ray (BD). LaserDisc players continued to be produced until July 2009, when Pioneer stopped making them.

== History ==
Optical video recording technology, using a transparent disc, was invented by David Paul Gregg and James Russell in 1963 (and patented in 1970 and 1990). The Gregg patents were purchased by MCA in 1968. By 1969, Philips had developed a videodisc in reflective mode, which has advantages over the transparent mode. MCA and Philips then decided to combine their efforts and first publicly demonstrated the videodisc in 1972.

LaserDisc was first available on the market in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 11, 1978, two years after the introduction of the VHS VCR, and four years before the introduction of the CD (which is based on laser disc technology). Initially licensed, sold, and marketed as &quot;MCA DiscoVision&quot; (also known as simply &quot;DiscoVision&quot;) in 1978, the technology was previously referred to internally as &quot;Optical Videodisc System&quot;, &quot;Reflective Optical Videodisc&quot;, &quot;Laser Optical Videodisc&quot;, and &quot;Disco-Vision&quot; (with a hyphen), with the first players referring to the format as &quot;Video Long Play&quot;.

Pioneer Electronics later purchased the majority stake in the format and marketed it as both &#x27; (format name) and &quot;LaserDisc&quot; (brand name) in 1980, with some releases unofficially referring to the medium as &#x27;. Philips produced the players while MCA produced the discs. The Philips-MCA collaboration was unsuccessful – and was discontinued after a few years. Several of the scientists responsible for the early research (Richard Wilkinson, Ray Dakin and John Winslow) founded Optical Disc Corporation (now ODC Nimbus).

LaserDisc was launched in Japan in October 1981, and a total of approximately 3.6 million LaserDisc players had been sold before its discontinuation in 2009.

In 1984, Sony offered a LaserDisc format that could store any form of digital data, as a data storage device similar to CD-ROM, with a large 3.28 GB storage capacity, comparable to the DVD-ROM format that would arrive 11 years later in 1995.

The first LaserDisc title marketed in North America was the MCA DiscoVision release of &quot;Jaws&quot; on December 15, 1978. The last title released in North America was Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; on October 3, 2000. Film titles continued to be released in Japan until September 21, 2001, with the last Japanese movie released being the Hong Kong film &quot;Tokyo Raiders&quot; from Golden Harvest. The last known LD title is Onta Station vol. 1018, a karaoke disc released on March 21, 2007. Production of LaserDisc players ended in July 2009, when Pioneer stopped making them. Pioneer continued to repair and service players until September 30, 2020, when the remaining parts inventory was exhausted.

It was estimated that in 1998, LaserDisc players were in approximately 2% of U.S. households (roughly two million). By comparison, in 1999, players were in 10% of Japanese households. A total of 16.8 million LaserDisc players were sold worldwide, of which 9.5 million were sold by Pioneer.
By 2001, LaserDisc had been completely replaced by DVD in the North American retail marketplace, as media were no longer being produced. Players were still exported to North America from Japan until the end of 2001. , the format retains some popularity among &quot;thousands&quot; of American collectors, and to a greater degree in Japan, where the format was better supported and more prevalent during its lifespan. In Europe, LaserDisc always remained an obscure format. It was chosen by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for the BBC Domesday Project in the mid-1980s, a school-based project to commemorate the 900 years since the original Domesday Book in England. From 1991 until the late 1990s, the BBC also used LaserDisc technology (specifically Sony CRVdisc) to play out their channel idents.

==Design==
A standard home video LaserDisc is in diameter and made up of two single-sided aluminum discs layered in plastic. Although similar in appearance to compact discs or DVDs, early LaserDiscs used analog video stored in the composite domain (having a video bandwidth and resolution approximately equivalent to the Type C videotape format) with analog frequency modulation (FM) stereo sound and pulse-code modulation (PCM) digital audio. Later discs used D-2 instead of Type C videotape for mastering. 

The LaserDisc at its most fundamental level was still recorded as a series of pits and lands much like CDs, DVDs, and even Blu-ray discs are today. In true digital media, the pits (or their edges) directly represent 1s and 0s of a binary digital information stream. On a LaserDisc, the information is encoded as analog frequency modulation and is contained in the lengths and spacing of the pits. A carrier frequency is modulated by the baseband video signal (and analog soundtracks). In a simplified view, positive parts of this variable frequency signal can produce lands and negative parts can be pits, which results in a projection of the FM signal along the track on the disc. When reading, the FM carrier can be reconstructed from the succession of pit edges, and demodulated to extract the original video signal (in practice, selection between pit and land parts uses intersection of the FM carrier with a horizontal line having an offset from the zero axis, for noise considerations). If PCM sound is present, its waveform, considered as an analog signal, can be added to the FM carrier, which modulates the width of the intersection with the horizontal threshold. As a result, space between pit centers essentially represent video (as frequency), and pit length code for PCM sound information. Early LaserDiscs featured in 1978 were entirely analog but the format evolved to incorporate digital stereo sound in CD format (sometimes with a TOSlink or coax output to feed an external digital-to-analog converter or DAC), and later multi-channel formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS.

Since digital encoding and compression schemes were either unavailable or impractical in 1978, three encoding formats based upon the rotation speed were used:
; CAV: Constant angular velocity or &quot;Standard Play&quot; discs supported several unique features such as freeze frame, variable slow motion, and reverse. CAV discs were spun at a constant rotational speed (1800 rpm for 525 line and Hi-Vision, and 1500 rpm for 625 line discs) during playback, with one video frame read per revolution. In this mode, 54,000 individual frames (30 minutes of audio/video for NTSC and Hi-Vision, 36 minutes for PAL) could be stored on a single side of a CAV disc. Another unique attribute to CAV was to reduce the visibility of crosstalk from adjacent tracks, since on CAV discs any crosstalk at a specific point in a frame is simply from the same point in the next or previous frame. CAV was used less frequently than CLV, and reserved for special editions of feature films to highlight bonus material and special effects. One of the most intriguing advantages of this format was the ability to reference every frame of a film directly by number, a feature of particular interest to film buffs, students and others intrigued by the study of errors in staging, continuity and so on.

; CLV: Constant linear velocity or &quot;Extended Play&quot; discs did not have the &quot;trick play&quot; features of CAV, offering only simple playback on all but the high-end LaserDisc players incorporating a digital frame store. These high-end LaserDisc players could add features not normally available to CLV discs, such as variable forward and reverse, and a VCR-like &quot;pause&quot;. By gradually slowing down their rotational speed (1800–600 rpm for NTSC and 2470–935 rpm for Hi-Vision) CLV encoded discs could store 60 minutes of audio/video per side for NTSC and Hi-Vision (64 minutes for PAL), or two hours per disc. For films with a run-time less than 120 minutes, this meant they could fit on one disc, lowering the cost of the title and eliminating the distracting exercise of &quot;getting up to change the disc&quot;, at least for those who owned a dual-sided player. The majority of titles were only available in CLV (a few titles were released partly CLV, partly CAV. For example, a 140-minute movie could fit on two CLV sides and one CAV side, thus allowing for the CAV-only features during the climax of the film).
; CAA: In the early 1980s, due to problems with crosstalk distortion on CLV extended play LaserDiscs, Pioneer Video introduced constant angular acceleration (CAA) formatting for extended play discs. CAA is very similar to CLV, save for the fact that CAA varies the angular rotation of the disc in controlled steps instead of gradually slowing down in a steady linear pace as a CLV disc is read. With the exception of 3M/Imation, all LaserDisc manufacturers adopted the CAA encoding scheme, although the term was rarely (if ever) used on any consumer packaging. CAA encoding noticeably improved picture quality and greatly reduced crosstalk and other tracking problems while being fully compatible with existing players.

As Pioneer introduced digital audio to LaserDisc in 1985, it further refined the CAA format. CAA55 was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of 55 minutes 5 seconds, reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of digital audio. Several titles released between 1985 and 1987 were analog audio only due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc (e.g., &quot;Back to the Future&quot;). By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in CAA60, allowing a total of 60 minutes 5 seconds. Pioneer further refined CAA, offering CAA45, encoding 45 minutes of material, but filling the entire playback surface of the side. Used on only a handful of titles, CAA65 offered 65 minutes 5 seconds of playback time per side. There were a handful of titles pressed by Technidisc that used CAA50. The final variant of CAA was CAA70, which could accommodate 70 minutes of playback time per side. There are no known uses of this format on the consumer market.

=== Audio ===
Sound could be stored in either analog or digital format and in a variety of surround sound formats; NTSC discs could carry a stereo analog audio track, plus a stereo CD-quality uncompressed PCM digital audio track, which were (EFM, CIRC, 16-bit and 44.1 kHz sample rate). PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit, 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term &quot;LaserVision&quot; is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while &quot;LaserDisc&quot; is used for those with digital audio. The digital sound signal in both formats is EFM-encoded, as in CD.

Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) and DTS, which are now common on DVD releases, first became available on LaserDisc, and &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) which was released on LaserDisc in Japan, was among the first home video releases ever to include 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround (along with a few other late-life releases from 1999 to 2001). Unlike DVDs, which carry Dolby Digital audio in digital form, LaserDiscs stored Dolby Digital in a frequency modulated form within a track normally used for analog audio. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player equipped with a special &quot;AC-3 RF&quot; output and an external demodulator in addition to an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator was necessary to convert the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder could handle.

In the mid to late 1990s, many higher-end AV receivers included the demodulator circuit specifically for the LaserDisc player&#x27;s RF-modulated Dolby Digital AC-3 signal. By the late 1990s, with LaserDisc players and disc sales declining due to DVD&#x27;s growing popularity, the AV receiver manufacturers removed the demodulator circuit. Although DVD players were capable of playing Dolby Digital tracks, the signals out of DVD players were not in a modulated form and were not compatible with the inputs designed for LaserDisc AC-3. Outboard demodulators were available for a period that converted the AC-3 signal to the standard Dolby Digital signal that was compatible with the standard Dolby Digital/PCM inputs on capable AV receivers. Another type marketed by Onkyo and Marantz converted the RF AC-3 signal to 6-channel analog audio.

The two FM audio channels occupied the disc spectrum at 2.3 and 2.8 MHz on NTSC formatted discs and each channel had a 100 kHz FM deviation. The FM audio carrier frequencies were chosen to minimize their visibility in the video image, so that even with a poorly mastered disc, audio carrier beats in the video would be at least ‑35 dB down, and thus, invisible. Due to the frequencies chosen, the 2.8 MHz audio carrier (Right Channel) and the lower edge of the chroma signal were very close together, and if filters were not carefully set during mastering, there could be interference between the two. In addition, high audio levels combined with high chroma levels could cause mutual interference, leading to beats becoming visible in highly saturated areas of the image. To help deal with this, Pioneer decided to implement the CX Noise Reduction System on the analog tracks. By reducing the dynamic range and peak levels of the audio signals stored on the disc, filtering requirements were relaxed and visible beats greatly reduced or eliminated. The CX system gives a total NR effect of 20 dB, but in the interest of better compatibility for non-decoded playback, Pioneer reduced this to only 14 dB of noise reduction (the RCA CED system used the &quot;original&quot; 20 dB CX system). This also relaxed calibration tolerances in players and helped reduce audible pumping if the CX decoder was not calibrated correctly.

At least where the digital audio tracks were concerned, the sound quality was unsurpassed at the time compared to consumer videotape. However, the quality of the analog soundtracks could vary greatly depending upon the disc and, sometimes, the player. Many early and lower-end LaserDisc players had poor analog audio components, and in turn, many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks, making digital soundtracks in any form more desirable to serious enthusiasts. Early DiscoVision and LaserDisc titles lacked the digital audio option, but many of those movies received digital sound in later re-issues by Universal, and the quality of analog audio tracks generally improved greatly as time went on. Many discs that had originally carried old analog stereo tracks received new Dolby Stereo and Dolby Surround tracks instead often in addition to digital tracks, which helped boost sound quality. Later analog discs also applied CX noise reduction, which improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the audio.

DTS audio, when available on a disc, replaced the digital audio tracks; hearing DTS-encoded audio required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.

On a DTS disc, digital PCM audio was not available, so if a DTS decoder was also not available, the only option was to fall back to the analog Dolby Surround or stereo audio tracks. In some cases, the analog audio tracks were further made unavailable through replacement with supplementary audio such as isolated scores or audio commentary. This effectively reduced playback of a DTS disc on a non-DTS equipped system to mono audio, or in a handful of cases, no film soundtrack at all.

Only one 5.1 surround sound option existed on a given LaserDisc (either Dolby Digital or DTS). As such, if surround sound was desired, the disc must be matched to the capabilities of the playback equipment (LaserDisc player and receiver/decoder) by the purchaser. A fully capable LaserDisc playback system included a newer LaserDisc player that was capable of playing digital tracks; had a digital optical output for digital PCM and DTS encoded audio; was aware of AC-3 audio tracks; and had an AC-3 coaxial output, an external or internal AC-3 RF demodulator and AC-3 decoder, and a DTS decoder. Many 1990s A/V receivers combined the AC-3 decoder and DTS decoder logic, but an integrated AC-3 demodulator was rare both in LaserDisc players and in later A/V receivers.

PAL LaserDiscs have a slightly longer playing time than NTSC discs, but have fewer audio options. PAL discs only have two audio tracks, consisting of either two analog-only tracks on older PAL LaserDiscs, or two digital-only tracks on newer discs. In comparison, later NTSC LaserDiscs are capable of carrying four tracks (two analog and two digital). On certain releases, one of the analog tracks is used to carry a modulated AC-3 signal for 5.1 channel audio (for decoding and playback by newer LaserDisc players with an &quot;AC-3 RF&quot; output). Older NTSC LaserDiscs made before 1984 (such as the original DiscoVision discs) only have two analog audio tracks.

==LaserDisc players==

The earliest players employed gas helium–neon laser tubes to read discs and had a red-orange light with a wavelength of 632.8 nm, while later solid-state players used infrared semiconductor laser diodes with a wavelength of 780 nm.

In March 1984, Pioneer introduced the first consumer player with a solid-state laser, the LD-700. It was also the first LaserDisc player to load from the front and not the top. One year earlier, Hitachi introduced an expensive industrial player with a laser diode, but the player had poor picture quality (due to an inadequate dropout compensator), and was made only in limited quantities. After Pioneer released the LD-700, gas lasers were no longer used in consumer players, despite their advantages, although Philips continued to use gas lasers in their industrial units until 1985.

Most LaserDisc players required the user to manually turn the disc over to play the other side. A number of players (all diode laser based) were made that were capable of playing both sides of the disc automatically, using a mechanism to physically flip a single laser pickup.

Pioneer produced some multi-disc models which held more than 50 LaserDiscs. For a short time in 1984, one company offered a &quot;LaserStack&quot; unit that added multi-disc capability to existing players: the Pioneer LD-600, LD-1100, or the Sylvania/Magnavox clones. It required the user to physically remove the player lid for installation, where it then attached to the top of the player. LaserStack held up to 10 discs and could automatically load or remove them from the player or change sides in around 15 seconds.

The first mass-produced industrial LaserDisc player was the MCA DiscoVision PR-7820, later rebranded the Pioneer PR7820. In North America, this unit was used in many General Motors dealerships as a source of training videos and presentation of GM&#x27;s new line of cars and trucks in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Most players made after the mid-1980s were capable of also playing Compact Discs. These players included a indentation in the loading tray, where the CD was placed for playback. At least two Pioneer models (the CLD-M301 and the CLD-M90) also operated as a CD changer, with several 4.7 in indentations around the circumference of the main tray.

The Pioneer DVL-9, introduced in 1996, was both Pioneer&#x27;s first consumer DVD player and the first combination DVD/LD player.

The first high-definition video player was the Pioneer HLD-X0. A later model, the HLD-X9, featured a superior comb filter, and laser diodes on both sides of the disc.

== Branding ==
During its development, MCA (which co-owned the technology), referred to it as the &quot;Optical Videodisc System&quot;, &quot;Reflective Optical Videodisc&quot; or &quot;Laser Optical Videodisc&quot;, depending on the document. They changed the name once in 1969 to &quot;Disco-Vision&quot; and then again in 1978 to &quot;DiscoVision&quot; (without the hyphen), which became the official spelling. Technical documents and brochures produced by MCA Disco-Vision during the early and mid-&#x27;70s also used the term &quot;Disco-Vision Records&quot; to refer to the pressed discs. MCA owned the rights to the largest catalog of films in the world during this time, and they manufactured and distributed the DiscoVision releases of those films under the &quot;MCA DiscoVision&quot; software and manufacturing label; consumer sale of those titles began on December 11, 1978, with the aforementioned &quot;Jaws&quot;.

Philips&#x27; preferred name for the format was &quot;VLP&quot;, after the Dutch words Video Langspeel-Plaat (&quot;Video long-play disc&quot;), which in English-speaking countries stood for Video Long-Play. The first consumer player, the Magnavox VH-8000 even had the VLP logo on the player. For a while in the early and mid-1970s, Philips also discussed a compatible audio-only format they called &quot;ALP&quot;, but that was soon dropped as the Compact Disc system became a non-compatible project in the Philips corporation. Until early 1980, the format had no &quot;official&quot; name. The LaserVision Association, made up of MCA, Universal-Pioneer, IBM, and Philips/Magnavox, was formed to standardize the technical specifications of the format (which had been causing problems for the consumer market) and finally named the system officially as &quot;LaserVision&quot;.

After its introduction in Japan in 1981, the format was introduced in Europe in 1983 with the LaserVision name, although Philips used &quot;VLP&quot; in model designations, such as VLP-600. Following lackluster sales there (around 12–15,000 units Europe-wide), Philips tried relaunching the entire format as &quot;CD-Video&quot; in 1987, with the name appearing not just on the new hybrid 12 cm discs, but also on standard 20 and 30 cm LaserDiscs with digital audio. While this name and logo appeared on players and labels for years, the &quot;official&quot; name of the format remained LaserVision. In the early 1990s, the format&#x27;s name was changed again to LaserDisc.

=== Pioneer ===
Pioneer Electronics also entered the optical disc market in 1977 as a 50/50 joint venture with MCA called Universal-Pioneer and manufacturing MCA-designed industrial players under the MCA DiscoVision name (the PR-7800 and PR-7820). For the 1980 launch of the first Universal-Pioneer player, the VP-1000 was noted as a &quot;laser disc player&quot;, although the &quot;LaserDisc&quot; logo was displayed clearly on the device. In 1981, &quot;LaserDisc&quot; was used exclusively for the medium itself, although the official name was &quot;LaserVision&quot; (as seen at the beginning of many LaserDisc releases, just before the start of the film). Pioneer reminded numerous video magazines and stores in 1984 that LaserDisc was a trademarked word, standing only for LaserVision products manufactured for sale by Pioneer Video or Pioneer Electronics. A 1984 Ray Charles ad for the LD-700 player bore the term &quot;Pioneer LaserDisc brand videodisc player&quot;. From 1981 until the early 1990s, all properly licensed discs carried the LaserVision name and logo, even Pioneer Artists titles.

On single-sided LaserDiscs mastered by Pioneer, playing the wrong side would cause a still screen to appear with a happy, upside-down turtle that has a LaserDisc for a belly (nicknamed the &quot;LaserDisc Turtle&quot;). The words &quot;Program material is recorded on the other side of this disc&quot; are below the turtle.

=== MCA ===
During the early years, MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After DiscoVision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio&#x27;s videodisc software label (called &quot;MCA Videodisc&quot; until 1984), began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and &quot;Jaws&quot;, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV DiscoVision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of &quot;Jaws&quot; no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the videodisc version due to high licensing costs (the original music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot;, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacement of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson&#x27;s songs. An MCA release of Universal&#x27;s &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; shows only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years, this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras. Also, the 1989 and 1996 LaserDisc releases of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; are the only formats to include the cut scene of Harrison Ford, in the role of the school principal, telling off Elliott for letting the frogs free in the biology class.

== Comparison with other formats ==
=== VHS ===
LaserDisc had several advantages over VHS. It featured a far sharper picture with a horizontal resolution of 425 television lines (TVL) for NTSC and 440 TVL for PAL discs, while VHS featured only 240 TVL with NTSC. Super VHS, released in 1987, reduced the quality gap, having horizontal luma resolution comparable to LaserDisc. But horizontal chroma resolution of Super VHS remained as low as that of standard VHS, about 40 TVL, while LaserDisc offered about 70 TVL of chroma resolution.

LaserDisc could handle analog and digital audio where VHS was mostly analog only (VHS could have PCM audio in professional applications but it was uncommon), and the NTSC discs could store multiple audio tracks. This allowed for extras such as director&#x27;s commentary tracks and other features to be added onto a film, creating &quot;Special Edition&quot; releases that would not have been possible with VHS. Disc access was random and chapter-based, like the DVD format, meaning that one could jump to any point on a given disc very quickly. By comparison, VHS would require tedious rewinding and fast-forwarding to get to specific points.

&quot;Initially&quot;, LaserDiscs were cheaper than videocassettes to manufacture, because they lacked the moving parts and plastic outer shell which were necessary for VHS tapes to work, and the duplication process was much simpler. A VHS cassette had at least 14 parts (including the actual tape) while LaserDisc had one part with five or six layers. A disc could be stamped out in a matter of seconds, whereas duplicating videotape required a complex bulk tape duplication mechanism and was a time-consuming process. By the end of the 1980s, average disc-pressing prices were over $5.00 per two-sided disc, due to the large amount of plastic material and the costly glass-mastering process needed to make the metal stamper mechanisms. Due to the larger volume of demand, videocassettes quickly became much cheaper to duplicate, costing as little as $1.00 by the beginning of the 1990s.

LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes. Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needed to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player&#x27;s clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs, and properly manufactured LaserDiscs could theoretically last beyond a lifetime. By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which was in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS&#x27;s lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact). The tape was also thin and delicate, and it was easy for a player mechanism, especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model, to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it, frilling (stretching) its edges, or even breaking it.

=== DVD ===
By the advent of DVD, LaserDisc had declined considerably in popularity, so the two formats never directly competed with each other.

LaserDisc was a composite video format: the luminance (black and white) and chrominance (color) information were transmitted in one signal, separated by the receiver. While good comb filters could separate the signals adequately, the two signals could not be &quot;completely&quot; separated. On DVD-Video, images are stored in the YCbCr format, with the chroma information being entirely discrete, which results in far higher fidelity, particularly at strong color borders or regions of high detail (especially if there is moderate movement in the picture) and low-contrast details such as skin tones, where comb filters almost inevitably smudge some detail.

In contrast to the entirely digital DVD, LaserDiscs used only analog video. As the LaserDisc format was not digitally encoded and did not make use of compression techniques, it was immune to video macroblocking (most visible as blockiness during high motion sequences) or contrast banding (subtle visible lines in gradient areas, such as out-of-focus backgrounds, skies, or light casts from spotlights) which could be caused by the MPEG-2 encoding process as video is prepared for DVD. Early DVD releases held the potential to surpass their LaserDisc counterparts, but often managed only to match them for image quality, and in some cases, the LaserDisc version was preferred. Proprietary human-assisted encoders manually operated by specialists could vastly reduce the incidence of artifacts, depending on playing time and image complexity. By the end of LaserDisc&#x27;s run, DVDs were living up to their potential as a superior format.

DVDs use compressed audio formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS for multichannel sound. Most LaserDiscs were encoded with stereo (often Dolby Surround) CD quality audio 16bit/44.1 kHz tracks as well as analog audio tracks.

DTS-encoded LaserDiscs have DTS soundtracks of 1,235 kbit/s instead of the reduced bitrate of 768 kbit/s commonly employed on DVDs with optional DTS audio.

=== Advantages ===
LaserDisc players could provide a greater degree of control over the playback process. Unlike many DVD players, the transport mechanism always obeyed commands from the user: pause, fast-forward, and fast-reverse commands were always accepted (barring malfunctions). There were no &quot;User Prohibited Options&quot; where content protection code instructed the player to refuse commands to skip a specific part (such as fast forwarding through copyright warnings). (Some DVD players, particularly higher-end units, do have the ability to ignore the blocking code and play the video without restrictions, but this feature is not common in the usual consumer market.)

With CAV LaserDiscs, the user could jump directly to any individual frame of a video simply by entering the frame number on the remote keypad, a feature not common among DVD players. Some DVD players have a cache feature, which stores a certain amount of the video in RAM, which allows the player to index a DVD as quickly as an LD, even down to the frame in some players.

Damaged spots on a LaserDisc could be played through or skipped over, while a DVD will often become unplayable past the damage. Some newer DVD players feature a repair+skip algorithm, which alleviates this problem by continuing to play the disc, filling in unreadable areas of the picture with blank space or a frozen frame of the last readable image and sound. The success of this feature depends upon the amount of damage. LaserDisc players, when working in full analog, recover from such errors faster than DVD players.

Similar to the CD versus LP sound quality debates common in the audiophile community, some videophiles argue that LaserDisc maintains a &quot;smoother&quot;, more &quot;film-like&quot;, natural image while DVD still looks slightly more artificial. Early DVD demo discs often had compression or encoding problems, lending additional support to such claims at the time. The video signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth of LaserDisc are substantially less than those of DVDs, making DVDs appear sharper and clearer to most viewers.

Another advantage, at least to some consumers, was the fact that any sort of anti-piracy technology was purely optional. It was claimed that Macrovision&#x27;s Copyguard protection could not be applied to LaserDisc, due to the format&#x27;s design. The vertical blanking interval, where the Macrovision signal would be implemented, was used for timecode and frame coding as well as player control codes on LaserDisc players. Due to its relatively small market share, there was never a push to redesign the format despite the obvious potential for piracy. The industry simply decided to engineer it into the DVD specification.

LaserDisc&#x27;s support for multiple audio tracks allowed for vast supplemental materials to be included on-disc and made it the first available format for &quot;Special Edition&quot; releases; the 1984 Criterion Collection edition of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is generally credited as being the first &quot;Special Edition&quot; release to home video (&quot;King Kong&quot; being the first release to have an audio commentary track included), and for setting the standard by which future &quot;Special Edition&quot; discs were measured. The disc provided interviews, commentary tracks, documentaries, still photographs, and other features for historians and collectors.

=== Disadvantages ===
Despite the advantages over competing technology at the time (namely VHS and Betamax), the discs were heavy—weighing about each—and cumbersome, were more prone than a VHS tape to damage if mishandled, and manufacturers did not market LaserDisc units with recording capabilities to consumers. Also, because of their size, greater mechanical effort was required to spin the discs at the proper speed, resulting in much more noise generated than other media.

The space-consuming analog video signal of a LaserDisc limited playback duration to 30/36 minutes (CAV NTSC/PAL) or 60/64 minutes (CLV NTSC/PAL) per side, because of the hardware manufacturer&#x27;s refusal to reduce line count and bandwidth for increased playtime, (as was done in VHS; VHS tapes had a 3 MHz video bandwidth, while LaserDisc preserves the full 6 MHz bandwidth and resolution used in NTSC broadcasts). After one side finished playing, a disc had to be flipped over to continue watching a movie, and some titles filled two or more discs, depending on the film&#x27;s runtime and whether or not special features are included. Many players, especially units built after the mid-1980s, could &quot;flip&quot; discs automatically (by rotating the optical pickup to the other side of the disc), but this was accompanied by a pause in the movie during the side change.

In the event the movie was longer than what could be stored on two sides of a single disc, manually swapping to a second disc was required at some point during the film (one exception to this rule was the Pioneer LD-W1, which featured the ability to load two discs and to play each side of one disc and then to switch to playing each side of the other disc). In addition, perfect still frames and random access to individual still frames was limited only to the more expensive CAV discs, which only had a playing time of approximately 30 minutes per side. In later years, Pioneer and other manufacturers overcame this limitation by incorporating a digital memory buffer, which &quot;grabbed&quot; a single field or frame from a CLV disc.

The analog information encoded onto LaserDiscs also did not include any form of built-in checksum or error correction. Because of this, slight dust and scratches on the disc surface could result in read errors which caused various video quality problems: glitches, streaks, bursts of static, or momentary picture interruptions. In contrast, the digital MPEG-2 format information used on DVDs has built-in error correction which ensures that the signal from a damaged disc will remain identical to that from a perfect disc right up until the damage to the disc surface prevents the laser from being able to identify usable data.

In addition, LaserDisc videos sometimes exhibited a problem known as &quot;crosstalk&quot;. The issue could arise when the laser optical pickup assembly within the player was out of alignment or because the disc was damaged or excessively warped. But it could also occur even with a properly functioning player and a factory-new disc, depending on electrical and mechanical alignment problems. In these instances, the issue arose due to the fact that CLV discs required subtle changes in rotating speed at various points during playback. During a change in speed, the optical pickup inside the player might read video information from a track adjacent to the intended one, causing data from the two tracks to &quot;cross&quot;; the extra video information picked up from that second track shows up as distortion in the picture which looks reminiscent of swirling &quot;barber poles&quot; or rolling lines of static.

Assuming the player&#x27;s optical pickup was in proper working order, crosstalk distortion normally did not occur during playback of CAV-format LaserDiscs, as the rotational speed never varied. If the player calibration was out of order, or if the CAV disc was faulty or damaged, other problems affecting tracking accuracy could occur. One such problem was &quot;laser lock&quot;, where the player read the same two fields for a given frame over and over, causing the picture to look frozen as if the movie were paused.

Another significant issue unique to LaserDisc involved the inconsistency of playback quality between different makers and models of player. On the majority of televisions, a given DVD player will produce a picture that is visually indistinguishable from other units; differences in image quality between players only becomes easily apparent on larger televisions, and substantial leaps in image quality are generally only obtained with expensive, high-end players that allow for post-processing of the MPEG-2 stream during playback.

In contrast, LaserDisc playback quality was highly dependent on hardware quality, and major variances in picture quality appeared between different makers and models of LaserDisc players, even when tested on low- to mid-range televisions. The obvious benefits of using high-quality equipment helped keep demand for some players high, while also keeping pricing for those units comparably high: in the 1990s, notable players sold for anywhere from US$200 to well over $1,000, while older and less desirable players could be purchased in working condition for as little as $25.

==== Laser rot ====
Many early LaserDiscs were not manufactured properly. The adhesive that was used contained impurities which were able to penetrate the lacquer seal layer and chemically attack the metalized reflective aluminum layer, altering its reflective characteristics. This, in turn, deteriorated the recorded signal. This was a problem that was termed &quot;laser rot&quot; among LaserDisc enthusiasts (also called &quot;color flash&quot; internally by LaserDisc pressing plants). Some forms of laser rot could appear as black spots that looked like mold or burned plastic which caused the disc to skip and the video to exhibit excessive speckling noise. But, for the most part, rotted discs could actually appear perfectly fine to the naked eye.

Later optical standards have also been known to suffer similar problems, including a notorious batch of defective CDs manufactured by Philips-DuPont Optical at their Blackburn, Lancashire facility in England during the late 1980s/early 1990s.

== Impact and decline ==
LaserDisc did not have high market penetration in North America due to the high cost of the players and discs (which were far more expensive than VHS players and tapes), and due to marketplace confusion with the technologically inferior CED, which also went by the name Videodisc. While the format was not widely adopted by North American consumers, it was received well among videophiles due to the superior audio and video quality compared to VHS and Betamax tapes, thus finding a place in nearly one million American homes by the end of 1990. The format was more popular in Japan than in North America because prices were kept low to ensure adoption, resulting in minimal price differences between VHS tapes and the higher quality LaserDiscs, which helped ensure that it quickly became the dominant consumer video format in Japan. Anime collectors in every country in which the LaserDisc format was released (which included both North America and Japan) also quickly became familiar with this format, and sought the higher video and sound quality of LaserDisc and the availability of numerous titles not available on VHS. (They were also encouraged by Pioneer&#x27;s in-house production of anime which made titles specifically with the format in mind.) LaserDiscs were also popular alternatives to videocassettes among movie enthusiasts in the more affluent regions of South East Asia, such as Singapore, due to their high integration with the Japanese export market and the disc-based media&#x27;s superior longevity compared to videocassette, especially in the humid conditions endemic to that area of the world.

The format also became quite popular in Hong Kong during the 1990s before the introduction of VCDs and DVD. While people rarely bought the discs (because each LaserDisc was priced around US$100), high rental activity helped the video rental business in the city grow larger than it had ever been previously. Due to integration with the Japanese export market, NTSC LaserDiscs were used in the Hong Kong market, in contrast to the PAL standard used for broadcast (this anomaly also exists for DVD). This created a market for multi-system TVs and multi-system VCRs which could display or play both PAL and NTSC materials in addition to SECAM materials (which were never popular in Hong Kong). Some LaserDisc players could convert NTSC signals to PAL during playback so that TVs used in Hong Kong could display the LaserDisc materials.

Despite the relative popularity, manufacturers refused to market recordable LaserDisc devices on the consumer market, even though the competing VCR devices could record onto cassette. This had a negative impact on sales worldwide. The inconvenient disc size, the high cost of both the players and the media and the inability to record onto the discs combined to take a serious toll on sales, and contributed to the format&#x27;s poor adoption figures.

Although the LaserDisc format was supplanted by DVD by the late 1990s, many LaserDisc titles are still highly coveted by movie enthusiasts (for example, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Song of the South&quot; which is unavailable in the US in any format, but was issued in Japan on LaserDisc.) This is largely because there are many films that are still only available on LaserDisc and many other LaserDisc releases contain supplementary material not available on subsequent DVD versions of those films. Until the end of 2001, many titles were released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD in Japan.

== Further developments and applications ==

=== Computer control ===
In the early 1980s, Philips produced a LaserDisc player model adapted for a computer interface, dubbed &quot;professional.&quot; In 1985, Jasmine Multimedia created LaserDisc jukeboxes featuring music videos from Michael Jackson, Duran Duran, and Cyndi Lauper. When connected to a PC this combination could be used to display images or information for educational or archival purposes, for example, thousands of scanned medieval manuscripts. This strange device could be considered a very early equivalent of a CD-ROM.

In the mid-1980s Lucasfilm pioneered the EditDroid non-linear editing system for film and television based on computer-controlled LaserDisc players. Instead of printing dailies out on film, processed negatives from the day&#x27;s shoot would be sent to a mastering plant to be assembled from their 10-minute camera elements into 20-minute film segments. These were then mastered onto single-sided blank LaserDiscs, just as a DVD would be burnt at home today, allowing for much easier selection and preparation of an edit decision list (EDL). In the days before video assist was available in cinematography, this was the only other way a film crew could see their work. The EDL went to the negative cutter who then cut the camera negative accordingly and assembled the finished film. Only 24 EditDroid systems were ever built, even though the ideas and technology are still in use today. Later EditDroid experiments borrowed from hard-drive technology of having multiple discs on the same spindle and added numerous playback heads and numerous electronics to the basic jukebox design so that any point on each of the discs would be accessible within seconds. This eliminated the need for racks and racks of industrial LaserDisc players since EditDroid discs were only single-sided.

In 1986, a SCSI-equipped LaserDisc player attached to a BBC Master computer was used for the BBC Domesday Project. The player was referred as an LV-ROM (LaserVision Read Only Memory) as the discs contained the driving software as well as the video frames. The discs used the CAV format, and encoded data as a binary signal represented by the analog audio recording. These discs could contain in each CAV frame video/audio or video/binary data, but not both. &quot;Data&quot; frames would appear blank when played as video. It was typical for each disc to start with the disc catalog (a few blank frames) then the video introduction before the rest of the data. Because the format (based on the ADFS hard disc format) used a starting sector for each file, the data layout effectively skipped over any video frames. If all 54,000 frames are used for data storage an LV-ROM disc can contain 324 MB of data per side. The Domesday Project systems also included a genlock, allowing video frames, clips and audio to be mixed with graphics originated from the BBC Master; this was used to great effect for displaying high-resolution photographs and maps, which could then be zoomed into.

During the 1980s in the United States, Digital Equipment Corporation developed the standalone PC control IVIS (Interactive VideoDisc Information System) for training and education. One of the most influential programs developed at DEC was Decision Point, a management gaming simulation, which won the Nebraska Video Disc Award for Best of Show in 1985.

Apple&#x27;s HyperCard scripting language provided Macintosh computer users with a means to design databases of slides, animation, video and sounds from LaserDiscs and then to create interfaces for users to play specific content from the disc through software called LaserStacks. User-created &quot;stacks&quot; were shared and were especially popular in education where teacher-generated stacks were used to access discs ranging from art collections to basic biological processes. Commercially available stacks were also popular with the Voyager company being possibly the most successful distributor.

Commodore International&#x27;s 1992 multimedia presentation system for the Amiga, AmigaVision, included device drivers for controlling a number of LaserDisc players through a serial port. Coupled with the Amiga&#x27;s ability to use a Genlock, this allowed for the LaserDisc video to be overlaid with computer graphics and integrated into presentations and multimedia displays, years before such practice was commonplace.

Pioneer also made computer-controlled units such as the LD-V2000. It had a back-panel RS-232 serial connection through a five-pin DIN connector, and no front-panel controls except &quot;Open/Close&quot;. (The disc would be played automatically upon insertion.)

Under contract from the U.S. military, Matrox produced a combination computer/LaserDisc player for instructional purposes. The computer was a 286, the LaserDisc player only capable of reading the analog audio tracks. Together they weighed and sturdy handles were provided in case two people were required to lift the unit. The computer controlled the player via a 25-pin serial port at the back of the player and a ribbon cable connected to a proprietary port on the motherboard. Many of these were sold as surplus by the military during the 1990s, often without the controller software. Nevertheless, it is possible to control the unit by removing the ribbon cable and connecting a serial cable directly from the computer&#x27;s serial port to the port on the LaserDisc player.

=== Video games ===
The format&#x27;s instant-access capability made it possible for a new breed of LaserDisc-based video arcade games. Several companies saw potential in using LaserDiscs for video games in the 1980s and 1990s, beginning in 1983 with Sega&#x27;s &quot;Astron Belt&quot;. Cinematronics and American Laser Games produced elaborate arcade games that used the random-access features to create interactive movies such as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; and &quot;Space Ace&quot;. Similarly, the Pioneer Laseractive and Halcyon were introduced as home video game consoles that used LaserDisc media for their software.

=== Hi-Vision LD ===

In 1991, several manufacturers announced specifications for what would become known as Hi-Vision LD, representing a span of almost 15 years until the feats of this HD analog optical disc system would finally be duplicated digitally by HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Encoded using NHK&#x27;s MUSE &quot;Hi-Vision&quot; analog HDTV system, MUSE discs would operate like standard LaserDiscs but would contain high-definition 1,125-line (1,035 visible lines; Sony HDVS) video with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The MUSE players were also capable of playing standard NTSC format discs and are superior in performance to non-MUSE players even with these NTSC discs. The MUSE-capable players had several noteworthy advantages over standard LaserDisc players, including a red laser with a much narrower wavelength than the lasers found in standard players. The red laser was capable of reading through disc defects such as scratches and even mild disc rot that would cause most other players to stop, stutter or drop-out. Crosstalk was not an issue with MUSE discs, and the narrow wavelength of the laser allowed for the virtual elimination of crosstalk with normal discs.

To view MUSE-encoded discs, it was necessary to have a MUSE decoder in addition to a compatible player. There are televisions with MUSE decoding built-in and set-top tuners with decoders that can provide the proper MUSE input. Equipment prices were high, especially for early HDTVs which generally eclipsed US$10,000, and even in Japan the market for MUSE was tiny. Players and discs were never officially sold in North America, although several distributors imported MUSE discs along with other import titles. &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, &quot;Bugsy&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; and &quot;Chaplin&quot; were among the theatrical releases available on MUSE LDs. Several documentaries, including one about Formula One at Japan&#x27;s Suzuka Circuit were also released.

LaserDisc players and LaserDiscs that worked with the competing European HD-MAC HDTV standard were also made.

=== Picture discs ===
Picture discs have artistic etching on one side of the disc to make the disc more visually attractive than the standard shiny silver surface. This etching might look like a movie character, logo, or other promotional material. Sometimes that side of the LD would be made with colored plastic, rather than the clear material used for the data side. Picture disc LDs only had video material on one side as the &quot;picture&quot; side could not contain any data. Picture discs are rare in North America.

=== LD-G ===
Pioneer Electronics—one of the format&#x27;s largest supporters/investors—was also deeply involved in the karaoke business in Japan, and used LaserDiscs as the storage medium for music and additional content such as graphics. This format was generally called LD-G. While several other karaoke labels manufactured LaserDiscs, there was nothing like the breadth of competition in that industry that exists now, as almost all manufacturers have transitioned to CD+G discs.

=== Anamorphic LaserDiscs ===
With the release of 16:9 televisions in the early 1990s, Pioneer and Toshiba decided that it was time to take advantage of this aspect ratio. Squeeze LDs were enhanced 16:9-ratio widescreen LaserDiscs. During the video transfer stage, the movie was stored in an anamorphic &quot;squeezed&quot; format. The widescreen movie image was stretched to fill the entire video frame with less or none of the video resolution wasted to create letterbox bars. The advantage was a 33% greater vertical resolution compared to letterboxed widescreen LaserDisc. This same procedure was used for anamorphic DVDs, but unlike all DVD players, very few LD players had the ability to unsqueeze the image for 4:3 sets, If the discs were played on a standard 4:3 television the image would be distorted. Some 4:3 sets (such as the Sony WEGA series) could be set to unsqueeze the image. Since very few people outside of Japan owned 16:9 displays, the marketability of these special discs was very limited.

There were no anamorphic LaserDisc titles available in the US except for promotional purposes. Upon purchase of a Toshiba 16:9 television viewers had the option of selecting a number of Warner Bros. 16:9 films. Titles include &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;Free Willy&quot;. The Japanese lineup of titles was different. A series of releases under the banner &quot;Squeeze LD&quot; from Pioneer of mostly Carolco titles included &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;Showgirls&quot;, &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;, and &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;. &quot;Terminator 2&quot; was released twice in Squeeze LD, the second release being THX certified and a notable improvement over the first.

=== Recordable formats ===
Another type of video media, &quot;CRVdisc&quot;, or &quot;Component Recordable Video Disc&quot; were available for a short time, mostly to professionals. Developed by Sony, CRVdiscs resemble early PC CD-ROM caddies with a disc inside resembling a full-sized LD. CRVdiscs were blank, write-once, read-many media that can be recorded once on each side. CRVdiscs were used largely for backup storage in professional and commercial applications.

Another form of recordable LaserDisc that is completely playback-compatible with the LaserDisc format (unlike CRVdisc with its caddy enclosure) is the &quot;RLV&quot;, or &quot;Recordable Laser Videodisc&quot;. It was developed and first marketed by the Optical Disc Corporation (ODC, now ODC Nimbus) in 1984. RLV discs, like CRVdisc, are also a WORM technology, and function exactly like a CD-R disc. RLV discs look almost exactly like standard LaserDiscs, and can play in any standard LaserDisc player after they have been recorded.

The only cosmetic difference between an RLV disc and a regular factory-pressed LaserDiscs is their reflective Red (showing up in photos as a purple-violet or blue with some RLV discs) color resulting from the dye embedded in the reflective layer of the disc to make it recordable, as opposed to the silver mirror appearance of regular LDs. The reddish color of RLVs is very similar to DVD-R and DVD+R discs. RLVs were popular for making short-run quantities of LaserDiscs for specialized applications such as interactive kiosks and flight simulators. Another, &quot;single-sided&quot; form of RLV exists with the silver side being covered in small bumps. Blank RLV discs show a standard Test Card when played in a Laserdisc player.

Pioneer also produced a rewritable LaserDisc system, the VDR-V1000 &quot;LaserRecorder&quot; for which the discs had a claimed erase/record potential of 1,000,000 cycles.

These recordable LD systems were never marketed toward the general public, and are so unknown as to create the misconception that home recording for LaserDiscs was impossible and thus a perceived &quot;weakness&quot; of the LaserDisc format.

== LaserDisc sizes ==

===30 cm (Full-size)===

The most common size of LaserDisc was , approximately the size of LP vinyl records. These discs allowed for 30/36 minutes per side (CAV NTSC/PAL) or 60/64 minutes per side (CLV NTSC/PAL). The vast majority of programming for the LaserDisc format was produced on these discs.

===20 cm (&quot;EP&quot;-size) ===
A number of LaserDiscs were also published. These smaller &quot;EP&quot;-sized LDs allowed for 20 minutes per side (CLV). They are much rarer than the full-size LDs, especially in North America, and roughly approximate the size of 45rpm () vinyl singles. These discs were often used for music video compilations (e.g. Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Breakout&quot;, Bananarama&#x27;s &quot;Video Singles&quot; or T&#x27;Pau&#x27;s &quot;View from a Bridge&quot;), as well as Japanese karaoke machines.

===12 cm (CD Video and Video Single Disc)===
There were also (CD size) &quot;single&quot;-style discs produced that were playable on LaserDisc players. These were referred to as CD Video (CD-V) discs, and Video Single Discs (VSD).

CD-V was a hybrid format launched in the late 1980s, and carried up to five minutes of analog LaserDisc-type video content with a digital soundtrack (usually a music video), plus up to 20 minutes of digital audio CD tracks. The original 1989 release of David Bowie&#x27;s retrospective &quot;Sound + Vision&quot; CD box set prominently featured a CD-V video of &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, and standalone promo CD-Vs featured the video, plus three audio tracks: &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot;, &quot;Changes&quot;, and &quot;The Supermen&quot;.

Despite the similar name, CD Video is entirely incompatible with the later all-digital Video CD (VCD) format, and can only be played back on LaserDisc players with CD-V capability or one of the players dedicated to the smaller discs. CD-Vs were somewhat popular for a brief time worldwide but soon faded from view.

In Europe, Philips also used the &quot;CD Video&quot; name as part of a short-lived attempt in the late 1980s to relaunch and rebrand the entire LaserDisc system. Some 20 and 30 cm discs were also branded &quot;CD Video&quot;, but unlike the 12 cm discs, these were essentially just standard LaserDiscs with digital soundtracks and no audio-only CD content.

The VSD format was announced in 1990, and was essentially the same as the CD-V, but without the audio CD tracks, and intended to sell at a lower price. VSDs were popular only in Japan and other parts of Asia and were never fully introduced to the rest of the world.

<doc id="255850" wikidata="Q570044" url="?curid=255850" title="Ansonia, Connecticut">
<text>Ansonia is a city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. Located on the Naugatuck River, it is immediately north of Derby, and about northwest of New Haven. The city is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. The population was 18,918 at the time of the 2020 census. The ZIP code for Ansonia is 06401. The city is served by the Metro-North Railroad. Ansonia Station is a stop on the railroad passenger commuter service&#x27;s Waterbury Branch connecting to New York&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal. Ansonia also is served by the Connecticut Transit bus carrier. Connecticut Route 8 serves Ansonia (Northbound, Exit 18; Southbound, Exit 19).

Ansonia was founded in 1844 by merchant and philanthropist Anson Green Phelps. Also referred to as &quot;The Copper City&quot;, is recognized for its history of heavy machine manufacturing industry in the lower Naugatuck Valley. Production included copper, brass, rubber and plastics processing, molding and tubing, iron castings, sheet metal, electric, automatic screw machine, textiles, and foundry products. The well-known Ansonia Clock Company was founded here in 1851.

Ansonia is the birthplace of David Humphreys, a diplomat and colonel in the American Revolutionary War.

== History ==
The area along the Naugatuck River, comprising the present Elm Street section of Ansonia and Derby Avenue section of Derby, was first settled by English colonists in 1652; it was originally a part of the township of Derby. Early settlers developed subsistence farming, and used the river for sawmills and gristmills.

In 1844, Anson Green Phelps (1781–1853), a merchant and philanthropist, wanted to expand the old borough of Birmingham (the present downtown of the city of Derby) to the north along the west side of the Naugatuck River to enable industrial development. Unable to purchase the land from its owner, in 1844 Phelps acquired land along the east side of the river; today this is Ansonia&#x27;s downtown section. A canal was dug for river power to drive the factories and businesses in the new industrial village, which Phelps named &quot;Ansonia&quot;. He wanted to name the industrial village as &quot;Phelpsville&quot;, but learned there was another village in the region by that name. As suggested by a friend, Phelps used his first name as a root instead, resulting in &quot;Ansonia&quot;.

As industry developed, soon Ansonia became the most populous area of Derby, boasting many factories. The state chartered Ansonia as a borough of Derby in 1864 and amended it in 1871, granting full municipal privileges. In 1888, a petition was circulated in the borough of Ansonia for the purpose of becoming a separate township from Derby. In 1889 the State General Assembly granted the separation, constituting the Borough, Hilltop, West Ansonia, and Elm Street areas as a separate town known as Ansonia. This was the 168th township in the state of Connecticut. In 1893, Ansonia was incorporated as a city, consolidating with the coterminous Town and the old borough.

By the end of the 19th century, the city had manufacturers of heavy machinery, electric supplies, brass and copper products, and silk goods. Ansonia, Derby, Shelton, Seymour, and Beacon Falls formed one of the most important industrial communities in the state.

=== Invention of America&#x27;s first bicycle ===
In 1866, while residing in Ansonia, inventor Pierre Lallement, a native of Pont-a-Mousson, France, submitted a patent application for the first pedaled (rotary crank mechanism) bicycle.

=== 20th century to present ===

Ansonia suffered grievous damage in the Flood of 1955 on August 19, when the Naugatuck River flooded due to heavy rain from Hurricane Diane. Submerging the land along the river, the flood destroyed many houses and businesses. The high river waters swept away Maple Street Bridge, one of two bridges linking the east and west sides of Ansonia. After the inundation, the authorities erected a flood wall along the east bank of the river to protect the city&#x27;s factories and Main Street. On the west bank, federal public housing was built to replace blocks of destroyed homes and businesses on Broad Street, now known as Olson Drive.

In the decades following the flood and suburbanization, Ansonia&#x27;s Main Street fell into decline as retail shoppers decamped to the Ansonia Mall at its far end. (This was replaced with the Ansonia Shopping Center in the 90&#x27;s) Later other malls attracted shoppers to nearby Milford, Trumbull, and Waterbury. Since the late 20th century, Main Street has been enlivened by the opening of several antique stores, a wine bar, a coffee shop, a Polish delicatessen, and other retail businesses.

For years, Ansonia had a daily newspaper, the &quot;Evening Sentinel&quot;, that enjoyed a wide readership throughout the Naugatuck Valley. However, the parent company of the &quot;Connecticut Post&quot; bought the &quot;Sentinel&quot; in the 1980s and quickly closed it, despite their promises not to do so. Allegedly, the &quot;Post&quot; wanted to consolidate their position as the region&#x27;s main newspaper. To provide an alternative, a non-profit, online-only news site, named &quot;The Valley Independent Sentinel&quot; in honor of the historic paper, has been organized and launched June 22, 2009.

In the early morning hours of November 6, 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign motorcade stopped on its way to Waterbury for the candidate to make an appearance and brief address in front of City Hall. He drew thousands to downtown, many with transistor radios tuned to live reports on WADS of Senator Kennedy&#x27;s progress towards Ansonia. President Kennedy returned to Ansonia on October 17, 1962, while on his way to Waterbury, but did not stop here.

President George H. W. Bush paid a visit to Ansonia by helicopter during the 1992 presidential election campaign. He was running far behind schedule due to severe weather damage to a large area of New Jersey. He arrived late and delivered a truncated speech, causing many residents in this heavily Democratic area to feel he had slighted their city.

In 2000, the Lower Naugatuck Valley, which includes Ansonia, was named an &quot;All America City&quot; by the National Civic League.

==== Rubber plant fire ====
In May 2001, a wind-driven fire destroyed the Latex Foam Company building, a very large rubber plant along the Naugatuck River in downtown Ansonia. The fire gutted the building, which was the workplace of 250 people. Firefighters from multiple counties fought the fire tirelessly for five days. Lingering clouds of foul-smelling smoke spread over the city and nearby communities, and chemical runoff produced by the fire unbalanced the ecosystem of the nearby river. The aforementioned Target store was constructed on the empty lot, opening in July 2007. Following the fire, the Latex Foam Company purchased a vacant plant off Route 110 in nearby Shelton and resumed production.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.72%, is water. The city is bisected by the Naugatuck River and spreads out from the river&#x27;s banks up the hills—some quite steep—of the river valley. On the west side of the river, the city abuts Derby and Seymour along Silver Hill. On the east side, the city&#x27;s Hilltop neighborhood meets Woodbridge.

The land along the river is mostly given over to factory sites (both operational and defunct), with an area of wooded land on the west bank close to the city&#x27;s northern boundary that belongs to the American Brass Company. In the early 1990s, this site was proposed by Texas company American Ref-Fuel for a solid waste-to-electric energy cogeneration plant. The proposal was controversial, and protests by residents resulted in its defeat.

Residential housing occupies most of the land in Ansonia, chiefly one- or two-family houses on plots of a 1/4 acre up to an acre. Larger houses on larger plots are found in the Hilltop neighborhood. The Ansonia Nature Center on Hilltop preserves some open fields and woodlands.

An airport once operated on Hilltop on a grass field, at the eastern edge of the city. During the Cold War, the United States military deployed Nike missiles in silos at the airport. Since the military released the airport grounds for other uses, developers have built residential housing there. The Nike base is now adapted as a horse farm with riding stables; few reminders of its former operations remain.

=== Neighborhoods ===
Downtown – The original industrial village and later borough of Ansonia. Includes the area stretching between the factories at the north side of down town to the newer shopping plazas on the south side of downtown (Big Y, Target, etc.)

Library District – The neighborhood surrounding the Ansonia Library. Just east of downtown on top of the cliff. Includes the residential neighborhood between State Street and Beaver Street including South Cliff Street, North Cliff Street, Mott Street and Cottage Avenue. Contains mostly single-family historic Queen Anne Victorian homes. While now predominantly middle class, this area was settled early in Ansonia&#x27;s history and was once home to many of the wealthy industrial families of Ansonia.

North End – The area comprising the North Main Street corridor stretching from Downtown to the Seymour town line.

Reservoir – The area comprises the area of the Beaver, North Prospect, and Prospect Street corridors. It is along the Quillinan Reservoir.

Derby Hill – The area surrounding the Elm Street and Jewett Street area on the east side. Elm Street is also the town&#x27;s historic district and was part of the original 1654 settlement of Derby. The name of this section of the town is sometimes disputed.

Hilltop – The area of the city that comprises the area of Prindle Avenue, Pulaski Highway and Ford Street corridors. This section was mainly farm land in the early days of the town. After World War II, it was developed as the largest residential area of the city.

West Ansonia – The residential village that comprised the west side of the Naugatuck River across from Ansonia (downtown). The original West Ansonia neighborhood consisted of High, Maple, and Jersey streets (the latter somewhat redirected and now known as &#x27;Olson Drive&#x27;), and later its name was synonymous with the entire present west side of the city.

Windy Hill – A section of West Ansonia centered around Murray, May, and Francis street. This area is considered to encompass the territory from the Derby town line to Grove Street.

Silver Hill – The section of West Ansonia along the Silver Hill Road corridor. Parts of this section are shared with Derby.

=== Climate ===

== Economy ==

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Theodore H. White referred to the Naugatuck Valley &quot;as the seedbed of Yankee ingenuity&quot; in his work &quot;The Making of the President, 1960&quot;. The city hosted the world headquarters of the Farrel Corporation, a leading producer of plastics and rubber processing equipment including the Banbury International Mixer. Ansonia Copper &amp; Brass, which supplied metal rod, wire and tube products to manufacturers of finished commercial products, also was located in the city.

The Ansonia Clock Company started manufacturing Ansonia clocks in the city in 1851. The company moved to Brooklyn, New York in 1878 but retained its home city&#x27;s name.

Since the late 20th century, much of the heavy industry has moved out, with jobs going overseas. The former factories sat vacant. In the late 1980s, the city began development of the Fountain Lake Commerce Park in the northwest border.

As a result of economic growth and plentiful employment in southwestern Connecticut, driven by corporate relocations from the New York City and Fairfield County metropolitan areas to nearby towns, Ansonia&#x27;s housing market improved in the early 2000s.

Trains on the Waterbury Branch run from Waterbury in the north to Bridgeport in the south, allowing Ansonia residents access to New York City via transfer to the main line at Bridgeport. Travel time from Ansonia to Grand Central Terminal in New York City is approximately two hours.

=== Bus ===
Ansonia is also served by buses of the 255 route of Connecticut Transit New Haven, connecting the city to New Haven.

== Public safety ==

Ansonia is protected by three municipal public safety agencies. It operates an Office of Emergency Management-based out of City Hall and the A.R.M.S building on West Main Street.

=== Police department ===
The Ansonia Police Department was founded around 1880 when Ansonia was a borough in the Town of Derby and Daniel Hayes was appointed the first police chief of the department. Chief Hayes died in 1882 after he succumbed to his injuries day after when he was shot while making an arrest.

The Police Department has 42 sworn officers and 12 civilian personnel. The Police Department is split between the patrol and detective divisions. The Police Department headquarters is located in the renovated former headquarters of the Farrel Corporation on Main Street.

== Landmarks ==

In addition to the Farrel Corporation and Ansonia Copper &amp; Brass facilities along the banks of the Naugatuck River in the center of the city, Ansonia&#x27;s landmarks include its public library (Ansonia Library), the Anna Sewell Memorial Fountain (honoring the author of &quot;Black Beauty&quot;), in front of the Library YMCA, National Guard Armory and many Victorian and Queen Anne houses. The prominent Ansonia Opera House is the oldest opera house in Connecticut built in 1870.

Ansonia is noted for its many churches and places of worship, including those forming five Catholic parishes, each historically associated with a particular ethnic group: Saint Joseph (Polish), Holy Rosary (Italian), Saint Anthony (Lithuanian; now combined with Holy Rosary), Our Lady of the Assumption (Irish), and Saints Peter and Paul (Ukrainian). There are also Congregationalist, Methodist, Episcopal, African Methodist Episcopal, Baptist, Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Pentecostal and other Christian denominations, as well as a Buddhist temple.

In the mid-1930s, after its original high school that was located on Prospect Street (now a City park) burned down, a new one was built on Howard Avenue. This is notable in that the building was designed by William Lescaze, one of the pioneers of modernism in American architecture. When it opened in 1936, it was one of the first &quot;modern&quot; high school buildings in the country. The former high school became Ansonia Middle School in 1999 when a new Ansonia High School was built at 20 Pulaski Highway in the Hilltop section of the city.

<text>Derby is a city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, approximately west-northwest of New Haven. It is located in southwest Connecticut at the confluence of the Housatonic and Naugatuck rivers. It shares borders with the cities of Ansonia to the north and Shelton to the southwest, and the towns of Orange to the south, Seymour to the northwest, and Woodbridge to the east. The city is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. The population was 12,325 at the 2020 census. It is the smallest city in Connecticut by area, at .

Derby was settled in 1642 as an Indian trading post under the name Paugasset. It was named after Derby, England, in 1675. It included what are now Ansonia, Seymour, Oxford, and parts of Beacon Falls.

Derby is home to the first electric trolley system in New England, only the second in the United States. It is also home to the first electric locomotive in U.S. history to be built and successfully used commercially for hauling freight. The locomotive, built in 1888, is still kept in running condition by the Shore Line Trolley Museum.

==History==

=== Colonial and Revolutionary era ===
Derby was settled in 1642 as an Indian trading post under the name Paugasset by John Wakeman of New Haven, though fur traders had been in the area before and Native Americans had lived there for centuries. In 1651, the first year-round houses were completed, at which time the New Haven Colony had recognized Paugasset as a town. The residents of the town of Milford protested Paugasset&#x27;s recognition as an independent town and, as a result, the order was rescinded and Paugasset returned to the Milford jurisdiction. In 1675, the former plantation of Paugasset was admitted as the township of Derby by the state legislature, named after Derby, England. Derby was incorporated on May 13, 1775.

=== 1800s ===
In 1836, the Colman brothers began the Birmingham Iron Foundry on the corner of Main Street and Water Street. It employed between 100 and 125 people, and was one of the many manufacturing businesses thriving in the city in the 1800s. In 1927, the company merged with Farrel Corporation of nearby Ansonia and was renamed Farrel-Birmingham Corporation. The Derby facility closed and was razed in 2000 to make way for a Home Depot. The Ansonia division is still in business, and opened their new plant in the Fountain Lake Commerce Park in 2017.

In the 19th century, corsets and hoop skirts were manufactured in the city. The Kraus Corset Factory is the oldest major factory building to survive from Derby&#x27;s corset manufacturing period. It was built by Sidney A. Downs, opened in 1879, and expanded in 1910. In 1987 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1990s it was converted to apartments and underwent a second addition; a first floor parking garage and three stories of apartments were added on the north side along Roosevelt Drive (Connecticut Route 34).

In 1872, the Derby Silver Company began production. In 1898, the company became a division of the International Silver Company headquartered in Meriden, but continued making silver with its brand name until 1933.

=== 1900s ===

Charlton Comics, a comic book publishing company that existed from 1944 to 1986, was based in Derby.

=== Towns created from Derby ===

* Oxford in 1798
* Seymour in 1850
* Beacon Falls in 1871 (also partly from neighboring towns)
* Ansonia in 1889

=== Neighborhoods ===

* Downtown
* West Derby

=== Redevelopment projects ===
Factory Street Square

In 2018, a development group working with the owners of the Baretta Landscaping property submitted a conceptual design to the planning and zoning commission for a four-phase 400-unit high density residential and commercial development on Factory Street in downtown Derby. The project, called Factory Street Square, was to be built in four phases over the next four to six years on unused light industrial property. The proposed buildings would sit on five acres of near-vacant land, and would be four stories high with first floor retail shops and restaurants, with residential space above. The project, tailored toward attracting Millennials and empty nesters to the area, will offer amenities not seen in other residential complexes in the city, including a health club; indoor golf simulator; rooftop garden; dog-sitting, walking, and grooming service; and an in-complex library. The site is located one block from rail and bus lines that meet at the Derby-Shelton Railroad Station, making the project a transit-oriented development. The project was expected to begin in late 2019 to early 2020.

South side of Main Street

Since 2003, the city and state have been demolishing buildings on the south side of Main Street (Connecticut Route 34) in order to widen the roadway from two to four lanes divided by a median. Multiple development projects have been proposed, from high density mixed use to big-box retail plazas, but none have been successful. In 2019, the last four buildings on the south side of Main Street were demolished; following delays, the widening project had a tentative construction start date of early 2020. The Factory Street Square project is the most recent proposal. Rather than attempting to redevelop the entire 23-acre parcel, the proposal only encompasses five acres.

Pershing Square Shopping Center

In 2014, Valley Bowl, a popular local bowling alley, was razed to erect a modern shopping plaza and realign an offset intersection. The realignment of the entrance was a joint venture between the Pershing Square developers and the developers of the adjacent property, Red Raider Plaza. Shortly after the completion of the plaza, it was purchased by Greenwich-based Urstadlt Biddle Properties Inc. for $9 million.

Red Raider Plaza

In 2011, Walgreen Company, a national retail pharmacy chain, purchased Red Raider Plaza for $7.15 million with plans to remodel one of the buildings and demolish the other to make room for a Walgreens Pharmacy. Following the announcement that Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid in 2015, Walgreens froze the construction of all new stores, including the Derby store. Walgreens maintains building ownership, and continued the redevelopment with some changes. The plaza received a significant renovation, parking lot improvements, and realignment of one of the entrances.

===Landmarks===
National Humane Alliance fountain
The city has resurrected its National Humane Alliance fountain—a century-old granite structure with lion-head spigots—as part of a gateway entrance plaza at the Division Street entrance to the Derby Greenway. The fountain was given to the city in 1906 by the National Humane Alliance, and was erected at the intersection of Seymour and Atwater Avenues. The water was first turned on on June 1, 1906. Years later it was moved to Founders Commons when traffic patterns made its original location a problem. It fell into disrepair and was not used as a fountain while on Founders Commons. When the Derby Greenway was built, the fountain was moved to its new location on June 22, 2006, fully restored with new plumbing and new lions&#x27; heads, and was formally dedicated with the surrounding Derby Hall of Fame Plaza on September 1, 2007. The fountain has three levels: the top level contains spigots in the shape of lion&#x27;s heads for humans, below is a large circular bowl for horses, and at the base are smaller bowls for dogs and cats.
Civil War Monument

In 1875, the Elisha S. Kellogg Post of the Grand Party of the Republic raised $1,475 to erect a statue to honor the soldiers of Derby and Huntington (now Shelton) who served in the Union forces. In 1878, an unknown person made a donation of $1,500 for the statue base, which made it possible to proceed with erecting the statue. The base was dedicated on July 4, 1877. Several years later, $3,200 was pledged for a remodel of the existing base and the addition of an upper base and a 7 ft bronze statue, bringing the total height of the monument to 21 ft 4in. The remodel and addition were constructed by Maurice J. Power of New York City; the sculptor of the bronze statue is unknown. The dedication of the remodel/addition was held on July 4, 1883, and was attended by approximately 8,000 people. The monument was restored in 2018 at a cost of $75,000.

== Notable events ==

=== 2001 anthrax attacks ===
On November 16, 2001, 94 year-old Ottilie Lundgren of Oxford was brought to Griffin Hospital in Derby, experiencing difficulty breathing and cold-like symptoms. Based on her symptoms and rapidly deteriorating condition, doctors suspected and began testing for anthrax. A response was made to the hospital from the FBI, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Connecticut State Police, Connecticut State Health Department, and Derby Fire Department HAZ-MAT team. The test was confirmed and treatment began, but was unsuccessful, and Lundgren died on November 22, 2001, making her the fifth and final victim of the 2001 anthrax attacks.

Derby and Griffin Hospital made worldwide news for days following the incident, and most major news outlets provided 24-hour news coverage for updates on Lundgren&#x27;s condition. Investigators thought that the anthrax was delivered in a letter via the United States Postal Service to her home in Oxford, but no suspicious letters were found, and the exact route of exposure was never determined. Post offices in Seymour and Wallingford were investigated, as they were the only two post offices that sent mail to Lundgren&#x27;s home; however, both facilities were determined to be clean. Lundgren&#x27;s home in Oxford was quarantined and searched by the FBI and Connecticut State Police, but nothing was found that indicated how she had been exposed.

In 2008, following a lengthy investigation that repeatedly came up empty, the FBI&#x27;s primary suspect was Bruce Edwards Ivins, a microbiologist, vaccinologist, and senior biodefense researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Maryland. However, Irvins took his own life shortly after the FBI named him as the primary suspect, and no formal charges or direct evidence has been found to substantiate these accusations. In 2010, the FBI closed the investigation into the attacks.

=== River Restaurant explosion ===

On December 6, 1985, at approximately 3:45pm EST, a three-story brick building, located at 268 Main Street in Derby, collapsed following a natural gas explosion, killing six people and injuring dozens. Natural gas had seeped into the sewer line following construction in the area. The River Restaurant located on the main level of the building had 18 customers and employees inside when the explosion occurred. Residents and businesses within a ten-block radius were evacuated as a precaution while firefighters worked to find those trapped in the debris. The Connecticut Fire Marshal&#x27;s Office, Connecticut State Police, and National Transportation Safety Board investigated and found a crack in a four-inch cast iron pipe near the explosion site. Connecticut&#x27;s &quot;Call Before You Dig&quot; program is a direct response to this incident.

=== Caroline Street fire ===
On August 12, 1991, at approximately 6:56pm EST, a fire broke out in the basement of a three-story, six-family home located at 269 Caroline Street. First arriving units found heavy fire in the nearly 100-year-old building along with reports of multiple trapped residents. The fire department rapidly struck a second and third alarm for additional resources from the surrounding area, including Ansonia, Shelton, Seymour, and Orange. In total, 18 people escaped or were rescued from the building, but a mother and her two children were killed in the fire. The Fire Marshal&#x27;s Office investigated and determined the cause of the fire was accidental.

=== Flood of 1955 ===

August 10–12, 1955 brought heavy rain to the east coast from Hurricane Connie, saturating the ground. A week later when Hurricane Diane passed through, the rain water had nowhere to go. As a result, the Housatonic and Naugatuck Rivers over flowed their banks and devastated the Housatonic and Naugatuck River Valley areas. The crest of the Naugatuck River reached 25.70 ft above flood stage, the highest in recorded history, which it still maintains to this day. Low-lying cities in the area, such as Derby, Shelton, Ansonia, Seymour, Beacon Falls, and Oxford all suffered impacts from the flood. In total, 87 people were killed and an estimated $200 million (1955) or $1.8 billion (2018) in damage was reported.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Green energy ===
Solar power

In 2015, the city entered into an agreement with BQ Energy Inc. of Poughkeepsie, NY which allowed them to install nearly 3,000 solar panels on the city&#x27;s former landfill, generating approximately 840 megawatts of power annually. The panels are used to offset the cost of powering municipal buildings and are expected to save the city 15–20 percent in energy costs over the next 20 years. The project was funded by United Illuminating through state bidding.

Hydrogen fuel cell energy

In 2018, the cities of Derby and Hartford were selected to be the home to two new hydrogen fuel cell plants through a bid process with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Fuel Cell Energy Inc., of Danbury, was selected to construct and operate these fuel cells, totaling 22.2 megawatts of power. Once constructed, the Derby facility would generate 14.8 megawatts of power, and the Hartford facility will generate 7.4 megawatts. The Derby facility is being constructed on a vacant parcel of land along Roosevelt Drive (Route 34), and construction was expected to begin in the summer of 2019.

Singer Village zero energy sub-division

The Singer Estate was built in 1927 by relatives of Isaac Singer, of Singer sewing machines. Most of the original 200 acres of property was subdivided off into homes and businesses. As of 2011, when it was donated to the Valley Community Foundation, the estate was approximately six acres in size. That same year it was purchased by Brookside Development LLC., to be further subdivided into Connecticut&#x27;s first zero-energy subdivision. The development group built seven homes on the remaining six acres, and the historic Singer mansion sits at the end of the newly constructed dead-end street. In 2016, the development was named the &quot;Best Green Energy Single Family Development&quot; and the &quot;Best Green Energy Efficient Home&quot; by the Home Builders and Remodelers Association of Connecticut.

<text>East Hartford is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 51,045 at the 2020 census. The town is located on the east bank of the Connecticut River, directly across from Hartford. It is home to aerospace manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney. It is also home to Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, a stadium used mainly for soccer and football with a capacity of 40,000 people.

==History==

When the Connecticut Valley became known to Europeans around 1631, it was inhabited by what were known as the River Tribes—a number of small clans of Native Americans living along the Great River and its tributaries. Of these tribes the Podunks occupied territory now lying in the towns of East Hartford and South Windsor, and numbered, by differing estimates, from sixty to two hundred bowmen. They were governed by two sachems, Waginacut and Arramamet, and were connected in some way with the Native Americans who lived across the Great River, in what is now Windsor. The region north of the Hockanum River was generally called Podunk; that south of the river, Hockanum; but these were no certain designations, and by some all the meadow along the Great River was called Hockanum.

In 1659, Thomas Burnham (1617–1688) purchased the tract of land now covered by the towns of South Windsor and East Hartford from Tantinomo, chief sachem of the Podunk Indians. Burnham lived on the land and later willed it to his nine children. The town of Hartford, founded in 1635, once included the land now occupied by the towns of East Hartford, Manchester, Bolton, Vernon, and West Hartford. During the Revolutionary War, French troops under Lieutenant General Comte de Rochambeau twice camped in town, before and after aiding General George Washington&#x27;s forces in the 1781 defeat of the British during the Siege of Yorktown.

East Hartford was incorporated as a separate town in October 1783. Manchester (then known as Orford Parish, adopting the name of a prominent English factory city) separated from East Hartford in 1823. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, residents began to form tax districts for fire protection, street lighting, sanitation, and other public works improvements. The East Hartford Fire District was granted a charter by the General Assembly in 1889 and organized in June 1891. The Meadow Fire District existed before the turn of the twentieth century. The Hockanum Sewer District and Hockanum Lighting District were formed in 1915 and 1916 respectively. The Silver Lane Fire and Lighting District was founded in 1925. On June 10, 1929, voters of the town approved a new charter. All of the old districts were abolished and a Town Council would govern the municipality.

Since first being settled, East Hartford&#x27;s economy was primarily agricultural, with tobacco being the main crop. All that changed in 1929, when Frederick Rentschler, head of Pratt &amp; Whitney, moved production from Hartford to a sprawling site in East Hartford. The grounds included a small airport called Rentschler Field that was in service from 1931 to 1999. It was originally used for test flights and maintenance operations, and later for corporate aviation. The site was decommissioned as an airport in the 1990s, and donated to the state of Connecticut by United Technologies in 1999, and a new Rentschler Field opened as a stadium with capacity of 40,000 people. Pursuant to a lease agreement with the State, UConn plays all its home football games at Rentschler Field.On July 16, 2015, it was announced that the stadium had been named Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in a deal between Pratt &amp; Whitney and UConn. The playing surface is still named Rentschler Field.

==Geography==

<doc id="255858" wikidata="Q337881" url="?curid=255858" title="Johnny English">
<text>Johnny English is a 2003 spy action comedy film directed by Peter Howitt and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and William Davies. It is a British-French venture produced by StudioCanal and Working Title Films, and distributed by Universal Pictures.

Starring Rowan Atkinson in the title role along with Natalie Imbruglia, Ben Miller and John Malkovich, it is the first instalment of the &quot;Johnny English&quot; film series and serves as a parody and homage to the spy genre, mainly the James Bond film series, as well as Atkinson&#x27;s Mr. Bean character. The character is also related to Atkinson&#x27;s bumbling spy character from a series of adverts in the United Kingdom for Barclaycard in the 1990s.

Released theatrically in the United States on 18 July 2003, the film met with mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful and grossed $160 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2003 and topped the country&#x27;s box office for the next three weekends, before being overtaken by &quot;X2&quot;. It was followed by two sequels, &quot;Johnny English Reborn&quot; (2011) and &quot;Johnny English Strikes Again&quot; (2018).

== Plot == 
Kindhearted but clumsy MI7 agent Johnny English dreams of becoming Agent One, MI7&#x27;s top agent. After the real Agent One is killed, followed by all of MI7&#x27;s remaining agents at his funeral, both due to English’s incompetence, he is left as the sole surviving agent capable of finishing Agent One&#x27;s mission.

Assigned to thwart a plot to steal the newly restored Crown Jewels at an event hosted by French prison magnate Pascal Sauvage, English meets the mysterious Lorna Campbell at the jewels&#x27; unveiling at the Tower of London. During a sudden blackout, the Crown Jewels are stolen and English accidentally knocks out the head of security. He fights an imaginary assailant to cover his mistakes, and gives a false description of the unseen suspect to MI7 head Pegasus.

English and his assistant Angus Bough follow a tunnel dug beneath the jewel&#x27;s display case and confront German thieves Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, who escape in a hearse. English loses them by pursuing a different hearse and ends up gatecrashing a funeral, until Bough saves him by having him pretend he is an escaped mental patient.

Sauvage is revealed to be Klein and Vendetta&#x27;s employer, and instructs the thieves to eliminate English. Pegasus refuses to believe English and Bough&#x27;s claims that Sauvage is involved and orders them to exclude Sauvage from the investigation. English and Bough are attacked by Vendetta, who escapes when English mistakenly attacks Bough. English again encounters Campbell and, having seen her at two crime scenes, his suspicions deepen when no record of her can be found.

Determined to expose Sauvage, English and Bough infiltrate Sauvage&#x27;s headquarters and learn that Sauvage, a descendant of Charles Edward Stuart, plans to make himself king using an impostor Archbishop of Canterbury. English observes that the fake Archbishop has a tattoo on his backside saying &quot;Jesus is coming — look busy&quot;. The pair encounter and try to interrogate Klein, but English accidentally injects him, and himself with a powerful muscle relaxant. Campbell appears and rescues the two, revealing herself to be an Interpol agent also tracking Sauvage. Attempting to inform Pegasus of his discoveries, English crashes a reception hosted by Sauvage and makes a fool of himself due to the relaxant. As a result, he is dishonourably removed from the case by Pegasus.

Sauvage abandons his plan to use the fake Archbishop and instead blackmails Queen Elizabeth II into abdicating and erasing her line of succession by threatening her corgis. Campbell, now in charge of the assignment, convinces English to travel to Sauvage&#x27;s French château and investigate behind Pegasus&#x27; back. After learning that Sauvage intends to transform mainland Britain into the world&#x27;s largest prison, English accidentally blows their cover attempting to steal an incriminating DVD but accidentally takes the wrong disc before the two agents are captured.

Bough rescues English and Campbell, and the three race to stop Sauvage&#x27;s coronation. English exposes the Archbishop&#x27;s bare bottom and discovers by the lack of the expected tattoo that he is genuine. Undeterred, English has Bough play the incriminating DVD, only to find it is footage of himself, from a bug placed by Sauvage in his apartment, lip-syncing to ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot; in his underclothes. Having snuck away, English swings back in on a wire to steal St Edward&#x27;s Crown from the Archbishop. Sauvage draws a gun and shoots at English, making him drop the crown, and moments before he is crowned, English lands on the throne knocking Sauvage off, and is crowned himself. As king, English has Sauvage arrested before restoring Elizabeth to the throne, requesting only a knighthood as a reward.

A radio newsreader announces that Sauvage is awaiting trial for high treason and execution, and that he has requested his brain be donated to schizophrenia research. English and Campbell drive to southern France but English accidentally ejects Campbell from his car while attempting to kiss her. In the post-credits scene, she lands in a swimming pool where Bough and a man matching the description of the imaginary assailant are on holiday.

== Production ==
In March 2000, before the release of &quot;Maybe Baby&quot;, Atkinson signed up to star as a spoof 007.

In July 2002, &quot;Johnny English&quot; principal photography commenced. The film shot for fourteen weeks, filming at Shepperton Studios, on location in London and St. Albans, and finally setting down in Monte Carlo for two days to complete filming the final scene. In September 2002, it was announced that Natalie Imbruglia would star alongside Atkinson.

The character of Johnny English himself is based on a similar character called Richard Latham, who Atkinson played in a series of British television adverts for Barclaycard. The character of Bough (pronounced &#x27;Boff&#x27;) was retained from the adverts though another actor, Henry Naylor, played the part in the ads. Some of the gags from the adverts made it into the film, including English incorrectly identifying a waiter, and inadvertently shooting himself with a tranquilliser ballpoint pen.

=== Filming locations ===

* Some scenes were filmed at Canary Wharf in London—indeed, the film duplicates the single real tower into two identical ones (albeit on the real site) for the fictional London Hospital and Sauvage&#x27;s headquarters at 1 Canada Square.
* The scenes set in Westminster Abbey were filmed in St. Albans Abbey: though this connection is solely implied through the dialogue—for this footage is never intercut with footage of the real abbey&#x27;s exterior. The interior (with the televisual screen hiding the St Albans organ) is clearly St Albans. The choir singing in the coronation scene is St Albans Cathedral Choir.
* Both the exteriors and interiors in the introductory dream sequence scene are in Mentmore Towers.
* The exterior and interior of MI7&#x27;s headquarters which English enters at the start is Freemasons&#x27; Hall, London, which is also used as Thames House (the MI5 headquarters) in &quot;Spooks&quot;.
* The scenes where Johnny English drives into Dover, Kent along the A20 road (with Dover Castle in the background) and then enters the Port of Dover (with a &quot;Dover Ferry Terminal&quot; sign, Dover&#x27;s Athol Terrace and the White Cliffs of Dover in the background) to catch a ferry to France, were all shot on location.
* The exterior of Sauvage&#x27;s French château is actually the castle atop St Michael&#x27;s Mount in Cornwall.
* The scenes in Brompton Cemetery were filmed there.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 32% based on 121 reviews with an average rating of 4.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A tame spy spoof that elicits infrequent chuckles.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<text>Lexington is a suburban town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States, located 10 miles (16 km) from Downtown Boston. The population was 34,454 as of the 2020 census. The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, and was first settled by Europeans as a farming community. Lexington is well known as the site of the first shots of the American Revolutionary War, in the Battle of Lexington on April 19, 1775, where the &quot;Shot heard &#x27;round the world&quot; took place. It is home to Minute Man National Historical Park.

==History==

=== Indigenous history ===
Native Americans inhabited the area that would become Lexington for thousands of years prior to European colonization of the Americas, as attested by a woodland era archaeological site near Loring Hill south of the town center. At the time of European contact, the area may have been a border region between Naumkeag or Pawtucket to the northeast, Massachusett to the south, and Nipmuc to the west, though the land was eventually purchased from the Naumkeag. The contact period introduced a number of European infectious diseases which would decimate native populations in virgin soil epidemics, leaving the area largely uncontested upon the arrival of large groups of English settlers in the Puritan Great Migration. In 1639, the Massachusetts General Court purchased the land that would become present-day Lexington, then within the boundaries of Cambridge, from the Naumkeag Squaw Sachem of Mistick.

=== Colonial history ===
The area that is now Lexington was first settled as part of Cambridge, Massachusetts. As the population increased, Lexington was incorporated as a separate parish, called Cambridge Farms, in 1691. This allowed the residents to have their own local church and minister, although they were still under jurisdiction of the Town of Cambridge. Lexington was incorporated as a separate town in 1713. It was then that it got the name Lexington. How the town received its name is the subject of some controversy. One view is that it was named in honor of Lord Lexington, an English peer. Another view is that it was named after Lexington (which was pronounced and is today spelled Laxton) in Nottinghamshire, England.

In the early colonial days, Vine Brook, which runs through Lexington, Burlington, and Bedford, and then empties into the Shawsheen River, was a focal point of the farming and industry of the town. It provided water for many types of mills, and in the 20th century, for farm irrigation.

=== Battle of Lexington ===
On April 19, 1775, what many regard as the first battle of the American Revolutionary War, the Battle at Lexington, took place. On the night of April 18, the British Army sent out 800 grenadiers and light infantry soldiers on foot from Boston, with the intention of destroying Colonial gunpowder and cannons that were being stored in Concord, as well as capturing two leaders of the Sons of Liberty, John Hancock and Samuel Adams, who were staying in Lexington. Hancock and Adams were warned of the danger by two alarm riders, Paul Revere and William Dawes, who alerted the countryside of the British military movements. When the British arrived on the Lexington Common not long after sunrise, they faced 77 men of the Lexington militia, commanded by Captain John Parker. Someone — still unknown to this day — fired a shot, provoking an exchange of musket fire between the two sides. Eight Lexington militia men were killed, dozens more wounded. After the rout, the British marched on toward Concord. There, several hundred militia and minute men from nearby towns assembled near the Old North Bridge to turn back the British and prevent them from capturing and destroying the Colony&#x27;s stores of gunpowder and military equipment.

Today, the town annually commemorates the battle on the Battle Green in the Downtown with a reenactment, as part of its Patriots Day festivities.
=== Urbanization ===

For decades after the Revolutionary War, Lexington grew modestly while remaining largely a farming community, providing Boston with much of its produce. Many of these farms became dense housing developments and subdivisions by the 1970s. One notable housing development was the Peacock Farm residential neighborhood. It was designed by architect Walter Pierce and was built between 1952 and 1958. As of 2012, the neighborhood was on the National Register of Historic Places. Lexington always had a bustling downtown area, which remains to this day. Lexington began to prosper, helped by its proximity to Boston, and having a rail line (originally the Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad, later the Boston and Maine Railroad) service its citizens and businesses, beginning in 1846 until 1981. In 1984, Due to the rapid urbanization that occurred in many other suburbs like Lexington, The MBTA proposed expanding the Red Line through Lexington, terminating in Bedford. Despite Lexington and Bedford being on board with the idea, Arlington residents lobbied against the plan and it was shot down by the Board of Selectmen.

Lexington, as well as many of the towns along the Route 128 corridor, experienced a jump in population in the 1960s and 1970s, due to the high-tech boom. Today, many companies are still moving into Lexington, with Takeda and BAE Systems both having major operations within the city limits. The urbanization and massive job growth resulted in soaring property values, and the school system becoming nationally recognized for its excellence. The town participates in the METCO program, which buses minority students from Boston to suburban towns to receive better educational opportunities than those available to them in the Boston Public Schools.

Lexington was the Cold War location of the USAF &quot;Experimental SAGE Subsector&quot; for testing a prototype IBM computer that arrived in July 1955 for development of a computerized &quot;national air defense network&quot; (the namesake &quot;Lexington Discrimination System&quot; for incoming ICBM warheads was developed in the late 1960s).

*Lexington is most well known for its history and is home to many historic buildings, parks, and monuments, most dating from Colonial and Revolutionary times.
*One of the most prominent historical landmarks, located in Lexington Centre, is the Lexington Common, commonly known as the Lexington Battle Green, and known by locals as &quot;the Battle Green&quot; or &quot;the Green&quot;. The Lexington Battle Green is known for being the site of the Battle of Lexington, where the &quot;shot heard round the world&quot; was fired. A statue of the captain of the Lexington Militia, John Parker, stands on the Battle Green. The statue is known as the &quot;Minuteman Statue&quot; by locals. A historical reenactment of the Battle of Lexington takes place on the Battle Green every year on Patriots&#x27; Day as part of the Patriots&#x27; Day celebrations. 
*Another important historical monument is the Revolutionary Monument, the nation&#x27;s oldest standing war memorial (completed on July 4, 1799) and the gravesite of those colonists slain in the Battle of Lexington.
*Other landmarks of historical importance include the Old Burying Ground (with gravestones dating back to 1690), the Old Belfry, Buckman Tavern (–1710), Munroe Tavern (), the Hancock–Clarke House (1737), the U.S.S. Lexington Memorial, the Centre Depot (old Boston and Maine train station, today the headquarters of the town Historical Society), Follen Church (the oldest standing church building in Lexington, built in 1839), and the Mulliken White Oak (one of Lexington&#x27;s most distinguished and oldest trees).

<text>Danvers is a town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States, located on the Danvers River near the northeastern coast of Massachusetts. The suburb is a fairly short ride from Boston and is also in close proximity to the beaches of Gloucester, Ipswich and Revere. Originally known as Salem Village, the town is most widely known for its association with the 1692 Salem witch trials. It was also the site of Danvers State Hospital, one of the state&#x27;s 19th-century psychiatric hospitals. Danvers is a local center of commerce, hosting many car dealerships and the Liberty Tree Mall. As of the 2020 United States Census, the town&#x27;s population was 28,087.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
The area was long settled by indigenous cultures of Native Americans. In the historic period, the Massachusett, a tribe of the Pequot language family, dominated the area.

The land that is now Danvers was once owned by the Naumkeag branch of the Massachusett tribe.
===17th century, Salem Village===
Around 1630, English colonists improved an existing Naumkeag trail as the Old Spanish Road, creating a connection to the main cities of Salem and Boston. Danvers was permanently settled in 1636 as Salem Village. The historical event for which Danvers is best-known is the Salem witch trials of 1692, which began in the home of Rev. Samuel Parris, and spread throughout the region. Resident Rebecca Nurse was convicted in a trial for witchcraft and executed, along with 19 other innocent victims. The Rebecca Nurse Homestead is still standing in Danvers, and can be visited as a historical landmark.

=== 18th century, Danvers ===
The residents of Salem Village petitioned the Massachusetts General Court several times over the following decades to become a town separate from Salem. In 1752, the General Court finally separated Danvers from Salem, but established Danvers as an independent self-governing &quot;district&quot; instead of incorporating it as a town, because of a royal prohibition against creating new towns in Massachusetts. A district had all the rights and powers of a town except the ability to send representatives to the legislature. Danvers was likely named for Danvers Osborn, and 1752 is the date locally commemorated on major anniversaries as the creation of Danvers, despite it not being incorporated yet at that time, because that is when it received its name.

On June 9, 1757, Massachusetts incorporated Danvers as a town regardless of the royal prohibition and, according to legend, King George II later vetoed this act of incorporation and returned it with the message &quot;The King Unwilling.&quot; Massachusetts simply ignored this royal veto, which was later included on the town&#x27;s seal.

From the Battle of Lexington onward, Danvers residents have participated in the armed forces. Noteworthy Revolutionary figures who stayed in Danvers include Royal Governor General Thomas Gage and Benedict Arnold. Arnold Plaque is found at 1 Conant Street.

Danvers was the birthplace of Israel Putnam, one of the most colorful figures of the colonial period and American Revolution. He built a successful farm, with fruit trees and flocks of sheep, and at one point crawled into a wolf&#x27;s den on his hands and knees to kill a wolf that had been eating his sheep. He went into the den&#x27;s narrow passage with a torch in one hand, a musket in the other, and a rope tied to his feet leading to his friends outside so they could pull him out if things went wrong. His one shot from the musket got the wolf. He fought with Roger&#x27;s Rangers in the French &amp; Indian War. At one point the Indians captured him, had tied him to a tree, and were going to burn him alive. A French officer rescued him in the nick of time.

When the first shots of the American Revolution were fired at the Battle of Lexington and Concord, word reached Putnam on his farm. He literally &quot;came off the plow&quot; to ride off to war again. Without bothering to change his clothes, he mounted his horse and rode the 25 miles to the scene in 18 hours. He was known for his courage, and demonstrated it at the Battle of Bunker Hill, where he is credited with giving the command &quot;Don&#x27;t fire until you can see the whites of their eyes.&quot; He became a major general in the Revolutionary War. His birthplace in Danvers, known as the General Israel Putnam House, still stands.

===19th century===
In 1847, the railroad came to Danvers. A street railway was installed in 1884, originally consisting of 69 horse-drawn trolleys. This system was later converted to electricity.

The Town Hall was built in 1855. It has been modified and renovated and is still in use. Also in 1855, the southern portion of Danvers broke away to become the town of South Danvers, later renamed Peabody.

In 1878, the Danvers State Hospital opened its doors. This was an institution to provide asylum and treatment for the mentally ill.

Originally an agricultural town, Danvers farmers developed two breeds of vegetables: the Danvers Onion (origin of the &quot;Oniontown&quot; nickname) and the Danvers Half-Long Carrot. This carrot was introduced by &quot;market gardeners&quot; in 1871.

Shoe manufacturing was a prominent industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Successful manufacturing companies included Ideal Baby Shoe. Local shoe companies were undercut in price by factories in other areas, and shoe manufacturing moved out.

===Films===
Movies filmed in Danvers, Massachusetts include:

* &quot;Hubie Halloween&quot; (2019)

===Chemical plant explosion===

On November 22, 2006, around 2:46 a.m., a major chemical explosion occurred at a facility housing Arnel Company (a manufacturer of industrial-use paint products) and CAI Inc. (a manufacturer of solvents and inks). The blast shook several North Shore towns, knocking homes off foundations and damaging buildings up to half a mile away. Glass windows shattered at least away, in neighboring Peabody and even in downtown Salem. The explosion was heard and felt up to away; the concussion was intense.

No one was killed, and none of the injuries were life-threatening, according to Fire Chief Jim Tutko. Approximately 90 homes were damaged. Residents whose homes were damaged or destroyed in the blast were taken to Danvers High School, where the Red Cross established a relief shelter. The blast occurred next to a marina, a bakery/pizza shop, and a gas station, and across the street from Eastern Propane Gas.

A May 13, 2008, report from the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board attributed the explosion to unintentional overnight heating of an ink-mixing tank containing flammable solvents.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Danvers has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.75%, is water. The tidal Danvers River begins near the southeast corner of town, and is formed by the confluence of the Porter River, Crane River and Waters River. These rivers, in turn, are fed by several brooks. The Ipswich River also flows along the town&#x27;s western border. The Putnamville Reservoir lies in the north end of the town, which supplies drinking water to the towns of Salem and Beverly.

Though being at sea level in the Danversport area, the town has numerous hills reaching around 130 to 180 feet in elevation, including Dales Hill (located at St. John&#x27;s Preparatory School), Ferncroft Hill, Folly Hill, Hathorne Hill, Lindall Hill, Nichols Hill, Putnam Hill, Rocky Hill and Whipple Hill (part of Endicott Park).

Danvers has numerous villages dating back to the late 1800s, when the town had a bustling railroad. These include Burley&#x27;s Corner, Danvers Center, Danversport, Downtown, Ferncroft, Hathorne (which still has its own post office and ZIP code of 01937), Putnamville and Tapleyville.

==Climate==

In a typical year, Danvers, Massachusetts temperatures fall below for 184 days per year. Annual precipitation is typically 44.1 inches per year (high for the US).

The town center lies north of Salem, west of Gloucester, northeast of Boston, and southeast of Salem, New Hampshire. Interstate 95 and Massachusetts Route 128 both pass through the town, just east of their junction in Peabody. U.S. Route 1 also passes through town, with a large junction with Interstate 95 in the northwestern end of town. The main highways are also crossed by Route 35, Route 62 and Route 114, with Routes 35 and 62 intersecting just north of the town center. The northern terminus of Route 35 is just over the Topsfield town line, where it meets Route 97.

Several MBTA bus routes pass through the town, between Peabody and Beverly. There is no commuter rail service within town; the Newburyport/Rockport Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail passes through neighboring Salem and Beverly. Two lines of the Springfield Terminal railroad, running through Springfield, Massachusetts, also cross through town, merging near the town center to head north.

Two runways of the Beverly Municipal Airport cross through the town. In the early 1950s, Earle F. Robbins constructed Robbins Airport, a private airfield, on his property on Collins Street extending to Prince Street. The airport closed in the 1980s and was demolished in the 1990s. The nearest regularly scheduled commercial flights are located at Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport.

<doc id="255867" wikidata="Q867460" url="?curid=255867" title="Long Island Sound">
<text>Long Island Sound is a marine sound and tidal estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. It lies predominantly between the U.S. state of Connecticut to the north and Long Island in New York to the south. From west to east, the sound stretches from the East River and the Throgs Neck Bridge in New York City, along the North Shore of Long Island, to Block Island Sound. A mix of freshwater from tributaries, and saltwater from the Atlantic Ocean, Long Island Sound is at its widest point and varies in depth from .
== Shoreline ==
Major Connecticut cities on the Sound include Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, New Haven, and New London. Cities on the New York side of the Sound include Rye, Glen Cove, New Rochelle, North Hempstead, Oyster Bay, Smithtown, Port Jefferson, Brookhaven and Riverhead, Larchmont, Mamaroneck and portions of Queens and the Bronx in New York City.

==Climate and geography==
The climate of Long Island Sound is warm temperate or Cfa in the Köppen climate classification. Summers are hot and humid often with convective showers and strong sunshine, while the cooler months feature cold temperatures and a mix of rain and occasional snow.

===Glacial history===

About 18,000 years ago, Connecticut, Long Island Sound, and much of Long Island were covered by a thick sheet of ice, part of the Late Wisconsin Glacier. About thick in its interior and about thick along its southern edge, it was the most recent of a series of glaciations that covered the area during the past 10 million years. Sea level at that time was about lower than today.

The continental ice sheet scraped off an average of of surface material from the New England landscape, then deposited the material (known as drift) from the Connecticut coast into the Sound, creating what is now Long Island (the terminal moraine). When the ice sheet stopped advancing 18,000 years ago (as addition of snow at the origin was in equilibrium with the melting at the southern edge), a large amount of drift was deposited, known as the Ronkonkoma Moraine, which stretches along much of southern Long Island. Later, another period of equilibrium resulted in the Harbor Hill Moraine along most of northern Long Island. The next moraines (recessional moraines) to the north were created just on and off the Connecticut coast. These moraines, created by much smaller deposits (probably from equilibrium states that were much shorter in time) are discontinuous and much smaller than those to the south.
The Connecticut coast moraines are in two groups: the Norwalk area and the Madison-Old Saybrook area. Sandy plains and beaches resulted from the erosion of moraines and redeposition in these areas, and to the east of each, where the drift cover is thinnest, exposed bedrock, creating rocky headlands, often with marshlands behind them.

The Captain Islands off Greenwich, Connecticut, along with the Norwalk Islands and Falkner Island off Guilford, Connecticut, are parts of a recessional moraine. Other islands, including the Thimble Islands, are for the most part exposed bedrock with a thin amount of drift, often not continuous. Other shoals and islands off the Connecticut coast are a mixture of these two extremes. The glacier also created several sandy outwash deltas off the coast, including one off Bridgeport, Connecticut, and another off New Haven, Connecticut. Fishers Island, New York, appears to be related to the Harbor Hill Moraine. To the east of the Thimble Islands, inland moraines along the Connecticut coast include the broken Madison Moraine and the Old Saybrook Moraine.

The Long Island Sound basin existed before the glaciers came. It probably had been formed by stream flows. A relatively thick cover of sand and gravel (termed outwash) was left in the basin from glacial meltwater streams. On the west, a ridge rising to about below the present sea level is called the Mattatuck Sill. Its lowest point is about below sea level. Glacial meltwater formed &quot;Lake Connecticut&quot;, a freshwater lake in the basin, until about 8,000 years ago, when the sea level rose to about below today&#x27;s level. Seawater then overflowed into the basin, transforming it from a nontidal, freshwater lake to a tidal, saline arm of the sea.

===Rivers===
Numerous rivers empty into the Sound, including:

Connecticut
* Connecticut River - Old Saybrook
* Housatonic River - Stratford &amp; Milford
* Mianus River - Greenwich
* Mill River (Quinnipiac River) - New Haven
* Mill River (Fairfield) - Fairfield
* Norwalk River - Norwalk

* West River (Connecticut) - West Haven

New York
* Byram River - Port Chester
* Hutchinson River-The Bronx
* Mamaroneck River - Mamaroneck
*Nissequogue River - Nissequogue &amp; Ft Salonga

==Fauna and flora==

===Flora===

====Seaweed====
Seaweeds in the Sound occur in greatest abundance in rocky areas between high tide and low tide as well as on rocks on the sea floor. Green seaweed populations fluctuate with the seasons. &quot;Monostroma&quot;, reproduces in the early spring and dies out by late summer. &quot;Grinnellia&quot; appears in August and disappears four to six weeks later.

In the rocky areas of the intertidal zone there are the seaweeds characterized by their brown tone, &quot;Fucus&quot; and &quot;Ascophyllum&quot;, some species of which have air bladders that allow them to float and receive direct sunlight even at high tide. Also present are &quot;Ectocarpus&quot; and red algas &quot;Polysiphonia&quot;, &quot;Neosiphonia&quot;, &quot;Porphyra&quot; and &quot;Chondrus&quot; (Irish moss).

In the marshy areas of the intertidal zone can be found &quot;Cladophora&quot; (mermaid&#x27;s hair), &quot;Ulva&quot; (sea lettuce) and &quot;Codium&quot;.

In the subtidal zone (below low tide) are &quot;Palmaria palmata&quot; a red alga, along with two algae, &quot;Laminaria&quot; (kelp) and &quot;Chorda&quot;. Kelp can often be found washed up on the beach, and individual specimens are not uncommonly a yard or two long. Deeper in the subtidal zone are red algae such as &quot;Spermothamnion&quot;, &quot;Antithamnion&quot; and &quot;Callithamnion&quot;, which also often float freely.

In tidal pools can be found red or pink colored &quot;Phymatolithon&quot;, which can often encrust rocks and mollusk shells. Also present are green algae, including &quot;Ulothrix&quot;, &quot;Cladophora&quot;, and &quot;Ulva&quot;.

====Plants found in tidal marshes====
Tidal marshes are some of the most productive biological systems in the world. Along the sound, they produce three to seven tons per acre per year of vegetation, largely in the form of salt marsh grasses. Much of this, enriched by decomposition, is flushed yearly into the estuary water where it directly contributes to the great finfish and shellfish production of the sound.

;Salt marsh plants

Salt water cordgrass (&quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;) grows along ditches and on the seaside edges of marshes where high tides daily inundate it. Salt meadow cordgrass (&quot;Spartina patens&quot;) and spikegrass (&quot;Distichlis spicata&quot;) grow in areas less frequently inundated by saltwater, typically closer to dry land. A short form of salt water cordgrass can sometimes be found in the depressions (&quot;pannes&quot;) in the higher areas where salt water collects and evaporates, leaving water even higher in salinity than seawater.

Other plants in the &quot;pannes&quot; are sea lavender, salt marsh aster, seaside gerardia, and some species of glasswort. Plants found near the border of the marsh with the upland include bayberry and groundsel-tree shrubs, switchgrass (growing where occasional storm tides reach), reeds and marsh elder.

;Cattail marshes
In areas where the Sound&#x27;s salt water is more diluted with freshwater from rivers, including along the shores of the larger river estuaries such as the Connecticut River, cattail marshes replace salt marshes. Various types of grasses, including wild rice, and sedges, including bulrushes, are found here.

;Eelgrass meadows
Eelgrass - sometimes known as &quot;Saltwater Eelgrass&quot; in order to distinguish it from Freshwater Eelgrass, which is a different species (&quot;Vallisneria americana&quot;) - is typically found in protected bays, coves, and other areas of brackish water, but it also persists along areas of exposed shoreline along Long Island&#x27;s north shore near Orient. Eelgrass is one of the few vascular plants found in the marine environment. Despite its name, it is actually not a species of underwater grass; instead, it is a plant that bears a physical resemblance to grass. It can tolerate a wide range of water salinity. It grows on muddy to sandy sediments (even among rocks), mostly below low tide, often forming large meadows. it grows best in shallow water because it is dependent upon sunlight, and the water of the Long island Sound can be very murky. Eelgrass roots help stabilize muddy sediments and can trap moving sand, helping prevent erosion. The leaves, that can range in size from less than 1 m to 2 m long, slow currents, providing calm environments for many species of mollusks and other invertebrates. Eelgrass is also an important food source for waterfowl, especially brant, a type of goose. During the 1930s, the Long Island Sound was struck by an outbreak of a mold infection known as &quot;eelgrass wasting disease&quot;. As a result, most of the eelgrass that grew in the sound was killed off, and as an extension, populations of wildlife in the area that depended upon the eelgrass either as food or as a habitat went into a sharp decline. During the succeeding decades, areas along the Connecticut coast saw a slow gradual recovery of eelgrass populations. Unfortunately, the north shore of Long Island did not see much success, and efforts have been made to re-introduce eelgrass by planting it, especially in the eastern part of the Long Island Sound in the waters of Suffolk County. It is unlikely that the Long Island Sound will experience a complete recovery of its eelgrass population because there are still occasional outbreaks of eelgrass wasting disease within the Sound.

====Plants found on beaches and dunes====
Few undisturbed beach and dune systems exist on the Connecticut shore, the ones that do are located along the eastern portion of the coastline (east of the Connecticut River). Sea rocket and dune grass occur here, but not in abundance. Dune grass and plants that thrive on dunes are largely responsible for the creation and growth of the dunes. On the seaward side of dunes can be found &quot;Lathyrus japonicus&quot; (beach pea), Dusty Miller, and seaside goldenrod. Other beach plants are orache, beach clotbur, seaside spurge, and jimson weed. On the more protected landward side of dunes are beach plum, bayberry and beach rose. Rare species found on the landward side are beach knotweed and sand false heather.

====Upland vegetation====
In areas next to the shoreline but hardly ever salty, the sound&#x27;s environment can nevertheless be a crucial factor in the presence of certain species. Areas near the Connecticut shore are the northern limit for some species needing the warmer environment provided by proximity to the Sound (which has a longer growing season than inland Connecticut and winters that are less harsh). These include sweetgum (only found in Connecticut in the extreme southwestern area of the state), the American holly, post oak and persimmon, which only exist in Connecticut along the shore. For many species which grow typically in sandy soils, the Connecticut shore is the northern limit.

Mature upland vegetation along the Connecticut coast is mostly hardwood forest, with dominant tree species including oaks and hickories, especially white oak, black oak, pignut hickory and mockernut hickory. Other trees include sassafras, black gum, and black cherry. Mature trees tend to be sparse in coastal forests, likely because of their greater exposure to the wind. This results in more sunlight reaching the forest floor, encouraging a jungle-like tangle of vines and shrubs, including the vines catbriar, poison ivy, bramble and bittersweet, and the shrubs blueberry, huckleberry, viburnum and hazelnut.

Along with the moderate climate, tropical cyclones can have an important impact on observable vegetation patterns. The greatest storms to hit the Sound in the twentieth century were the 1938 hurricane, the 1955 hurricane, Hurricane Belle in 1976, Hurricane Gloria in 1985, Hurricane Irene in 2011, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. After Hurricane Belle, leaves near the coast were badly salt-burned, then turned brown and shriveled. Many trees were downed by the storm, leaving openings in the forest cover, promoting the growth of vines and shrubs.

===Fauna===
====Fish====
The Sound is inhabited by both marine fish and anadromous fish (oceanic or estuarine species that spawn in freshwater streams and rivers, see fish migration).

The most common marine fish in the Sound include porgy, butterfish, winter flounder, summer flounder, windowpane flounder, fourspot flounder, northern and striped sea robin, little skate, menhaden, Atlantic silversides, black seabass, blackfish (tautog), cunner, bluefish, and smooth dogfish. Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander in and out of the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark and thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.

====Mollusks====
Mollusks (gastropods and bivalves) that can be found include the rough periwinkle near the high-tide line, the European periwinkle, the northern yellow periwinkle, the blue mussel (a popular, edible species), the eastern oyster, the Atlantic slipper shell or &quot;common slippershell&quot; (&quot;Crepidula fornicata&quot;), the hard clam (also known as the quahog, little neck clam or cherrystone clam), the Atlantic bay scallop, the mud snail (also known as the eastern mud nassa), the salt marsh snail (or &quot;coffee bean snail&quot;), the Atlantic oyster drill, the northern moon snail, Atlantic moon snail, the channeled and knobbed whelks.

====Crustacea====
Crustaceans include crabs, shrimp and lobsters. In the Sound there are the green crab (a non-native species first reported in Boston around 1900, but a common crab found on the shore, where it feeds on eastern oysters and soft-shell clams), blue crab, red crab, Jonah crab in deepwater areas, and the Atlantic rock crab, which settles in large numbers along rocky shores, especially around Millstone Point, Niantic Bay and Fishers Island Sound. Other crabs found include the lady crab, spider crabs, and fiddler crabs; hermit crabs and mole crabs are also found. By the late 1980s, the Japanese shore crab, an invasive species, was the most commonly found crab in the sound.

The sand shrimp &quot;Crangon septemspinosa&quot; and two species of grass shrimp are plentiful along the shore, especially in late summer and fall. The American lobster is fished commercially.

====Mammals, reptiles, and amphibians====
Most animal species on the Connecticut side of the Sound also occur inland, but some are much more abundant along the shore. Animals along the Sound are most concentrated in the salt marshes. Two species of shrews, the masked shrew and the American short-tailed shrew, are common in salt marshes. The least shrew has been thought to exist in small numbers in the salt marshes of western Connecticut. Rodents include the white-footed mouse, the meadow vole (probably the most abundant coastal mammal) and the meadow jumping mouse. Muskrats are heavily trapped but remain abundant. Raccoons and red foxes who live in areas near the marshes will hunt in them. The long-tailed weasel and short-tailed weasel are both found near the Sound, occasionally living in the salt marshes. Dolphins are occasionally spotted in Long Island Sound, along with Harbor seals and gray seals that can be found among the rocks off Stonington and Groton at the eastern end. Long-finned pilot whales and harbor porpoises can also be infrequently sighted in open water, a few miles off the coast. In 1975, a finback whale beached itself in Groton.

Animals that need moist woodlands are found in the coastal area (and elsewhere), including the diamondback terrapin in salt marshes and brackish waters (and deposits and hatches its eggs on nearby sandy beaches). Terrapin meat became such a popular delicacy in the early 1900s that the price for a dozen adult females reached as high as US$120. Overhunting made the species uncommon and even rare through most of the Sound and eliminated at some places. After its popularity as food declined, the terrapin population started recovering.

Sea turtles occasionally travel north on the Gulf Stream and wander into the Sound. The loggerhead turtle, green turtle and leatherback turtle are rarely seen along the Connecticut shore.

Other reptiles and amphibians found along the edges of the salt marshes and nearby bodies of water include the green frog, bullfrog, pickerel frog, spotted turtle, painted turtle, northern water snake, and common snapping turtle. On beaches and sandy areas there are Fowler&#x27;s toads (which are also found inland but find sandy areas preferable), the American toad, and the hognose snake (which feeds on Fowler&#x27;s toads).
====Birds====
There are six broad categories of bird habitats near Long Island Sound: (1) open water areas, including bays, coves, rivers and the Sound itself; (2) tidal marshes; (3) mudflats; (4) sandy beaches; (5) offshore islands; and (6) mainland uplands, including woodlands and fields. Some birds are summer residents or winter residents, while others are spring and fall transients. Year round residents include herring gull, great black-backed gull, common tern and double-crested cormorant. Coastal migrants (also called &quot;transients&quot;) include shorebirds such as plovers, turnstones, sandpipers, willet and yellowlegs. Summer residents include the osprey, seaside sparrow, saltmarsh sparrow, clapper rail, mallard and black duck, herons and egrets, including the black-crowned night heron and snowy egret as well as the least tern and piping plover. Upland species include the yellow warbler, red-eyed vireo, red-winged blackbird and Carolina wren.

Winter residents include large flocks of ducks, geese, and swans winter in the Sound. In West Haven, Connecticut 8,000 scaup (also called broadbills or bluebills) were regularly counted in the 1970s. Greater scaup, black ducks, mallards, and Canada geese are among the most abundant wintering birds. There are also significant populations of red-breasted mergansers, common goldeneyes, buffleheads, white-winged scoter, American wigeon (also sometimes called baldpate), long-tailed ducks and mute swans. Others (less abundant) include gadwalls, northern pintails, green-winged teal, northern shovelers (also sometimes called broadbill), ruddy ducks, redheads, ring-necked ducks, snow geese, and brant.

====Rare and endangered species====
Rare, endangered and extinct species of the Sound include the eastern spadefoot, a rare, toadlike amphibian that hasn&#x27;t been recorded in the area since 1935. Its overall coloring is beige or off-white with a pattern of green markings. Small orange dots punctuate this pattern.

As many as 1,500 shortnose sturgeon, listed as &#x27;endangered&#x27; by the Endangered Species Act, inhabit the Connecticut River. Approximately 900 of those live downstream of Holyoke Dam. While shortnose sturgeon primarily remain in their natal rivers, they will feed in estuarine waters like Long Island Sound and make extended trips along the Atlantic Coast, tagged individuals sometime being identified in multiple rivers during their lifetimes.

==History==
Long Island Sound was formed when the terminal moraine that dammed the waters of glacial Lake Connecticut failed, and sea water mixed with the lake&#x27;s fresh waters. Prior to colonization, it&#x27;s estimated that around 10,000 to 15,000 natives inhabited along Long Island Sound. The first European to record the existence of Long Island Sound was the Dutch navigator Adriaen Block, who entered the sound from the East River in 1614. The sound was known as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Belt&quot; in colonial times and the reefs that run across the sound were known as Devil&#x27;s Stepping Stones, from which Stepping Stones Lighthouse got its name.

As the Industrial Revolution grew, Long Island Sound began to be utilized more for manufacturing and production uses that are still observed to this day, like textiles, metal finishing, fishing, and oyster harvesting. Yet, the economic and population growth the Industrial Revolution created led to increased pollution. Around the 1950s and 60s, the US Government began to recognize more of the environmental impacts pollution was having on water quality, as well as human health around regions like Long Island Sound. After the Clean Water Act was passed federally in 1972 to protect water quality around the US, the Environmental Protection Agency partnered with Connecticut and New York to pass the Long Island Sound Study (LISS) in 1985 with plans for restoration and clean-up projects in the region. More habitat conservation, health monitoring, and pollution standards have been established between NY and CT in the years since to protect the estuary for future generations. 

==Uses==

===Transportation===
Ferries provide service between Long Island and Connecticut, notably the Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Ferry (between Port Jefferson and Bridgeport), and the Cross Sound Ferry (between Orient Point and New London). The ferries that cross Long Island Sound carry automobiles, trucks and buses, as well as foot passengers.

===Fishing===

Long Island Sound has historically had rich recreational and commercial fishing, including oysters, lobsters, scallops, blue crabs, tuna flounder, striped bass, and bluefish. However, in recent years the western part of the sound has become increasingly deficient of marine life. The fishing and lobster industries have encouraged efforts to identify the cause of the dead water and rectify the problem.

Lobsters have suffered diseases of unknown cause, but recreational fishing improved dramatically in the last 10 years due, in large part, to restoring a key component in the food chain, menhaden (a.k.a. &quot;bunker&quot;) fish which are a mainstay of striped bass and other pelagic fish. The ban of netting of bunker - which were over-fished in the late 1990s - has significantly improved the quality and volume of the striped bass population in Long Island Sound.

===Further development===
Underwater cables transmit electricity under Long Island Sound, most notably a new and controversial Cross Sound Cable that runs from New Haven in western Connecticut, to Shoreham in central Long Island, and an older one from Rye in Westchester County to Oyster Bay on Long Island. Scientists debate whether submarine power cables are safe for marine ecosystems, but installations like large-scale armoing around cables helps to protect overall ecological impact and provides ecosystem regeneration.

Over the years, bridges over the sound have been proposed, including a bridge between Rye in Westchester County and Oyster Bay on Long Island; between New Haven, Connecticut, and Shoreham on Long Island; between Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Port Jefferson on Long Island; or between Orient Point, New York, and Rhode Island. A tunnel under the sound, as between Rye and Oyster Bay has also been proposed, to carry both freeway lanes and railroads. However, no crossing has been built since the Throgs Neck Bridge in the early 1960s.

==Pollution==
The Long Island Sound ecosystem has historically been polluted by a number of different sources, including industry, agriculture and communities (untreated sewage and urban runoff). Pollutants entering the Sound include toxic substances such as heavy metals; a specific example includes mercury discharged by the hatting industry in Danbury, Connecticut. Other pollutants include pathogens, debris, and nutrients (which contain nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer runoff).

Eutrophication occurs when bodies of water, like Long Island Sound, are exposed to higher levels of nutrients like nitrogen, causing harmful overgrowth of cyanobacteria that feed on them. Eutrophication can also lead to algal blooms and eventually hypoxia, when runoff into water causes rapid development of algae and phytoplankton that blocks the surface of water from sunlight and deprives oxygen to marine organisms. Eutrophication and its effects are direct environmental impacts on the Sound that are exacerbated by higher temperatures, stratified water columns (when the water is not well mixed vertically) and excess nutrients. The primary target for water remediation tactics in Long Island Sound have been nutrients discharged by sewage treatment plants and in surface runoff.

Long Island Sound sustains significant populations of fish and nurseries. This biological function has been threatened by both terrestrial and chemical alterations resulting from urbanization of the area. Specifically 25–35% of the tidal wetlands in the Sound have been dredged, filled, and developed over and hypoxia and eutrophication resulting from pollution have led to low dissolved oxygen levels (less than 4.8 mg of oxygen per liter) in the water. The low dissolved oxygen levels limit the fishes&#x27; ability to swim, feed, grow and reproduce and loss of habitat prevents success in fish larval growth. The impacts listed here are directly associated with these specific species in Long Island Sound: killifishes, silversides, bay anchovy, eels, menhaden, cunner, tautog, sticklebacks, winter flounder, weakfish, bluefish, tomcod and striped bass.

An example of impacts from nitrogen is a shift in the types of plankton that make up their community in Long Island Sound. Over the last several decades, excess nitrogen may have adversely affected diatoms—microscopic, single-celled algae at the base of the food chain, which make shells (&#x27;frustules&#x27;) of opaline silica. When diatoms are less productive, they are replaced by other phytoplankton such as dinoflagellates or blue-green algae, which grow well in waters with high nitrogen levels, but do not need silica. Such changes in the base of the food chain leads to consequences such as an increase in abundance of jellyfish and decline in shellfish and other fish.

Starting in the 1990s, Connecticut and federal United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials defined no-dumping areas in which commercial or recreational boat users were prohibited from releasing untreated sewage into the Sound near the coastline. In 2007 state and federal officials announced the ban had extended to the entire Connecticut coast and applied to both treated and untreated sewage. New Hampshire and Maine have similar bans, but Massachusetts, Maine and New York do not (all are within the contributing watersheds). From the 1990s to 2007, the number of pumping stations for boat sewage tripled to 90 at marinas up and down the coast. Violators may be charged with a state misdemeanor and face $250 fines, or a federal civil penalty, with fines of up to $2,000.

To address the water quality problems, EPA created the Long Island Sound Study (LISS) in 1985, which led to LISS&#x27;s Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) to support development of a nitrogen total maximum daily load (TMDL) in 1994. The TMDL implements innovative strategies, including a nitrogen credit trading program for sewage treatment plants in Connecticut, and bubble permits for sewage treatment plants in New York. Results point to significant nitrogen reductions in Long Island Sound, and significant cost savings. By 1998, a plan to reduce nitrogen outputs of effluent into the Sound was agreed upon by the federal government and the states of New York and Connecticut. The goal was to reduce the amount of nitrogen entering the Sound by 58.5 percent as of 2014. New York City agreed with New York state and Connecticut to reduce nitrogen levels in 2001, but backed off its commitment and was sued by the state. In early 2006, the city agreed to lower nitrogen outputs and was given until 2017 to meet its reduction goals. By 2007, $617 million had been spent in upgrading sewage treatment plants, with 39 out of 104 retrofitted with devices to remove nitrogen.

According to the EPA National Estuary Program Coastal Protection Report for June 2007, the western part of the Sound was in the worst condition. The report gives a &quot;fair&quot; rating to water quality in the sound and poor marks to fish, bottom-feeders and sediment. High levels of PCBs were found in fish samples, and high concentrations of the pesticide DDT were found in sediment. Development resulting from population increases, past industrial pollution and stormwater runoff all contribute to the poor quality of the water, according to the report.

Nitrogen pollution in the Sound has been declining in the 21st century. By 2016, both NY and CT attained their goals to reduce nitrogen percentages by 58.5 percent established in the TMDL. According to LISS as of 2018, significant improvements to wastewater treatment plants have led to &quot;over 50 million fewer pounds of nitrogen a year are discharged into Long Island Sound&quot; in comparison to the 1990s. In 2015 the Long Island Sound Study concluded that the Sound is cleaner and healthier than it has been, but still impaired from pollution and habitat loss. To continue improving the quality of Long Island Sound, both ongoing challenges and adapting to new conditions due to climate change need to be addressed.

===Dumping of dredged sediment===
Polluted sediment from harbor, river and waterway dredging has been dumped in four sites in the Sound, although in late 2007 two of them at the eastern end of the Sound were scheduled to be closed at some future date. A dumping site near Stamford, Connecticut, and another near New Haven, Connecticut, were expected to remain open. In 2007, the U.S. EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began a five- to seven-year, $16 million study on more environmentally friendly ways to dredge harbors in the Sound. Dumping the sediment in the Sound is considerably less expensive than other options, according to Connecticut harbor officials and state and federal environmental officials.

Federal officials had concluded that sediment from Bridgeport Harbor was too contaminated for disposal in the Sound, and in 2007 the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) required Norwalk, Connecticut, to &quot;cap&quot; of dumped sediment from a planned Norwalk Harbor dredging project with of material. Silt and sediment from the harbor contains heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, according to DEP officials.

==Legal status==

In 1985, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Long Island Sound is a juridical bay. The case involved a jurisdictional dispute among New York State, Rhode Island, and the United States.

The classification of &#x27;juridical bay&#x27; means that the states, and not the federal government, have jurisdiction over the Long Island Sound waters. This also means that the legal coastline of the United States incorporates the southern shore of Long Island, but not the alternative that would have been to consider the coastline to follow additionally the southern shores of Connecticut, and the eastern shores of Westchester County, the Bronx, and Manhattan.

<text>Hans von Aachen (1552 – 4 March 1615) was a German painter who was one of the leading representatives of Northern Mannerism.

Hans von Aachen was a versatile and productive artist who worked in many genres. He was successful as a painter of princely and aristocratic portraits, and further painted religious, mythological and allegorical subjects. Known for his skill in the depiction of nudes, his eroticized mythological scenes were particularly enjoyed by his principal patron, Emperor Rudolf II. These remain the works for which he is best known. He also painted a number of genre paintings of small groups of figures shown from the chest upwards, laughing, often apparently using himself and his wife as models. Von Aachen usually worked on a small scale and many of his works are cabinet paintings on copper.

The life and work of Hans von Aachen bear unique witness to the cultural transfer between North, South and Central Europe in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. After training in the tradition of Netherlandish Renaissance painting the artist moved to Italy in 1574, where he remained for about 14 years, mainly working in Venice. He returned in 1587 to his native Germany, where he took up residence in Munich in Bavaria. His final years were spent in Prague. The combination of the Netherlandish realism of his training and the Italian influences gained during his travels gave rise to his unique painting style.

His presence in the important art centres of the time, the wide distribution of prints after his designs and his congenial character all contributed to his international fame during his lifetime.

==Life==

Hans von Aachen was born in Cologne. His surname is derived from the birthplace of his father, Aachen in Germany.

Hans von Aachen began painting in Germany as a pupil of the portrait painter Georg Jerrigh, who had trained in Antwerp. He probably joined the Cologne painters&#x27; guild before leaving for Italy around 1574. Like many northern artists of his time, such as the Flemish painter Bartholomeus Spranger, he then spent a long period in Italy. He lived in Venice from 1574 to 1587 where he became a member of the Netherlandish and German community of artists, printmakers and art dealers. He was active as a copyist and worked in the workshop of the Flemish painter and art dealer Gaspar Rem who was a native of Antwerp. Rem arranged for von Aachen to go through an apprenticeship with an artist referred to as Morett (or Moretto). This apprenticeship involved making copies of famous works in Venice&#x27;s churches. Many of these copies were destined for the Northern-European art market. A contemporary art collector and dealer in Antwerp by the name of Hermann de Neyt had a collection of nearly 850 original and copied paintings, of which six were by Hans von Aachen (two of these being copies after Raphael).

Von Aachen went to Rome in 1575. Here he studied the antique sculptures and the works of Italian masters. He became a member of the circle of northern artists active in Rome such as Otto van Veen, Joris Hoefnagel, the brothers Paul and Matthijs Bril, Hans Speckaert and Joseph Heintz the Elder. He was able to secure a commission for a &quot;Nativity&quot; for the Church of the Gesù, the mother church of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in Rome. In Florence in the years 1582–3 he established a reputation for his portraits, which led to commissions from the ruling Medici family. In 1585 he again settled in Venice.
He returned to Germany in 1587, first to Augsburg where he painted portraits for the wealthy Fugger family. He also worked in Munich, where he was commissioned to paint two altarpieces for the church of St Michael. After visiting his home town Cologne and a return trip to Venice, he chose Munich as his residence from 1589. He married Regina, the daughter of the composer Orlando di Lasso in Munich. In Germany he became well known as a painter of portraits for noble houses. He also produced historical and religious scenes and earned a wide reputation. He painted several works for Duke William V of Bavaria.

In Munich he came into contact with the Imperial Court in Prague. In 1592 he was appointed official painter of Emperor Rudolf II who resided in Prague. Von Aachen did not need to reside at the court in Prague as his appointment was as a &#x27;Kammermaler von Haus aus&#x27; (a court painter from home) who could work from his residence. Rudolf was one of the most important art patrons of his time. He held painting in particular esteem and issued a &quot;Letter of Majesty&quot; to the Prague Painter&#x27;s Guild exempting painters from the guild rules, awarding them annual stipends and decreeing that painting should no longer be referred to as a craft but as the &#x27;art of painting&#x27;. The special treatment provided to painters and artists generally in Rudolf&#x27;s Prague turned the city into a major art centre. The large output consisted mainly of mythological paintings with an erotic quality or complex allegories glorifying the Emperor. The Emperor was open to artistic innovation and he presided over a new affected style, full of conceits, which became known as Mannerism. This style stressed sensuality, which was expressed in smoothly modeled, elongated figures arranged in elegant poses, often including a nude woman seen from behind.
Rudolf also relied on von Aachen as an advisor on his art collection and what is usually called a &#x27;diplomat&#x27;. In this role he travelled to the owners of art collections to convey the emperor&#x27;s often shameless bullying to make them accept his offers for their treasures. His diplomatic duties required him to travel extensively. In 1602 he travelled to Brunswick, Wolfenbüttel, Wittenberg and Dresden, and between 1603 and 1605 to Innsbruck, Venice, Turin, Mantua and Modena. The purpose of these later travels was in part for him to make portraits of potential future consorts of the Emperor. Emperor Rudolf II conferred knighthood on him in 1605. Von Aachen only moved to Prague years later possibly in 1601 or earlier in 1597. Here he received many commissions for mythological and allegorical subjects.
After his patron&#x27;s downfall in 1605 and his death in 1612 von Aachen was, unlike most of Rudolf&#x27;s court artists, retained by Rudolf&#x27;s successor Matthias I who gave him an estate in Raussnitz. Emperor Matthias sent him to Dresden and Vienna in 1612, while 1613 saw him back in Augsburg, and 1614 again in Dresden.

Von Aachen&#x27;s pupils included Pieter Isaacsz, who was his pupil in Italy while Andreas Vogel, Christian Buchner and Hans Christoph Schürer were his pupils in Prague.

Hans von Aachen belonged to the circle of artists in Rome who frequented Anthony van Santvoort.

He died in Prague in 1615.

*List of paintings by Hans von Aachen

===General===
Hans von Aachen was a versatile artist who produced portraits, paintings of historical and religious subjects, genre pictures and allegories. He was one of the principal representatives of the late Mannerist style of art that had been nurtured at the court of Rudolf II in Prague around 1600. One of these works is &quot;Allegory of Peace, Art and Abundance&quot;.

His style ranges between an idealized style of painting close to Roman and Florentine Mannerism as well as to Venetian masters Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto and the newly emerging tradition of northern realism. Von Aachen developed his own mannerist technique from his study of Tintoretto and Michelangelo&#x27;s followers. Throughout his career his principal influences were the style of Bartholomeus Spranger and Hendrick Goltzius who dominated the art scene in Germany at the time.

===Prints===
While von Aachen did not produce prints himself, his paintings were much reproduced by other court artists of Rudolf II including included Wolfgang Kilian, Dominicus Custos as well as various members of the Sadeler family. These prints contributed to his fame and influence across Europe, despite the Mannerist style having fallen from fashion soon after his death.

Von Aachen also produced original designs for the court&#x27;s printmakers. An example is the series of prints published under the title &quot;Salus generis humani&quot; (Salvation of Mankind). The series consists of 13 plates engraved by the Flemish printmaker Aegidius Sadeler who was active at the Prague court. Made in 1590, the engravings feature scenes from the Life of Christ after designs by Hans von Aachen. The central compositions are surrounded by emblematic borders, whose designs originate from illuminations in the missal (Missale romanum) made by the Flemish artist Joris Hoefnagel in 1581–90 for Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria (now in the Austrian National Library, Vienna).

<doc id="255869" wikidata="Q246154" url="?curid=255869" title="M (James Bond)">
<text>M is a codename held by a fictional character in Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond book and film series; the character is the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service for the agency known as MI6. Fleming based the character on a number of people he knew who commanded sections of British intelligence. M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors, as well as appearing in twenty-four films. In the Eon Productions series of films, M has been portrayed by four actors: Bernard Lee, Robert Brown, Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes, the incumbent; in the two independent productions, M was played by John Huston, David Niven and Edward Fox.

==Background==

Fleming based much of M&#x27;s character on Rear Admiral John Godfrey, who was Fleming&#x27;s superior at the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War. After Fleming&#x27;s death, Godfrey complained &quot;He turned me into that unsavoury character, M.&quot;

Other possible inspirations include Lieutenant Colonel Sir Claude Dansey, the deputy head of MI6 and head of the wartime Z network, who achieved different interpretations of his character from those who knew him: Malcolm Muggeridge thought him &quot;the only professional in MI6&quot;, while Hugh Trevor-Roper considered Dansey to be &quot;an utter shit, corrupt, incompetent, but with a certain low cunning&quot;. A further inspiration for M was Maxwell Knight, the head of MI5, who signed his memos as &quot;M&quot; and whom Fleming knew well. The tradition of the head of MI6 signing their name with a single letter came from Mansfield Smith-Cumming, who would sign his initial &quot;C&quot;, with green ink.

Another possibility for the model of M was William Melville, an Irishman who became the head of the Secret Service Bureau, the forerunner of both MI5 and MI6: Melville was referred to within government circles as M. Melville recruited Sidney Reilly into government service and foiled an assassination plot against Queen Victoria on her 1887 Golden Jubilee. Fleming&#x27;s biographer John Pearson also hypothesised that Fleming&#x27;s characterisation of M reflects memories of his mother:
==Novels==
Fleming&#x27;s third Bond novel, &quot;Moonraker&quot;, establishes M&#x27;s initials as &quot;M**** M*******&quot; and his first name is subsequently revealed to be Miles. In the final novel of the series, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, M&#x27;s full identity is revealed as Vice Admiral Sir Miles Messervy KCMG; Messervy had been appointed Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service after his predecessor had been assassinated at his desk.

A naval theme runs throughout Fleming&#x27;s description of M and his surroundings, and his character was described by journalist Ben Macintyre as &quot;every inch the naval martinet&quot;. Macintyre wrote that in his study of Fleming&#x27;s work, Kingsley Amis outlined the way Fleming had described M&#x27;s voice, being: angry (three times); brutal, cold (seven times); curt, dry (five times); gruff (seven times); stern, testy (five times).

Over the course of twelve novels and two collections of short stories, Fleming provided a number of details relating to M&#x27;s background and character. In &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; it is revealed that M&#x27;s pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year, (£ in 2025 pounds) £1,500 of which comes from retired naval pay. Although his pay is good for the 1950s and 1960s, it is never explained how M received or can afford his membership at Blades, an upscale private club for gentlemen he frequents in London to gamble and dine. Blades has a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen and all must be able to show £100,000 (£ in 2025 pounds) in cash or gilt-edged securities. Kingsley Amis noted in his study, &quot;The James Bond Dossier&quot;, that on M&#x27;s salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling. As a personal favour to M, the staff at Blades keeps a supply of cheap red wine from Algeria on hand but does not include it on the wine list. M refers to it as &quot;Infuriator&quot; and tends only to drink it in moderate quantities unless he is in a very bad mood.

The academic Paul Stock argues that M&#x27;s office is a metonym for England and a stable point from which Bond departs on a mission, whilst he sees M as being an iconic representative of England and Englishness.

In the first post-Fleming book, &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;, M is kidnapped from Quarterdeck, his home, and Bond goes to great lengths to rescue him. The later continuation books, written by John Gardner, retain Sir Miles Messervy as M, who protects Bond from the new, less aggressive climate in the Secret Service, saying that at some point Britain will need &quot;a blunt instrument&quot;. In Gardner&#x27;s final novel, &quot;COLD&quot;, M is kidnapped and rescued by Bond and finishes the book by retiring from MI6. Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;The Facts of Death&quot; continued Messervy&#x27;s retirement, where he still resides in Quarterdeck. The book also introduces a new M, Barbara Mawdsley.

==Films==
===Eon Productions films===
====Bernard Lee: 1962–1979====

M was played by Bernard Lee from the first Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), until &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979). In line with Fleming&#x27;s character, he is given the name of Miles in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me.&quot; In &quot;Dr. No,&quot; M refers to his record of reducing the number of operative casualties since taking the job, implying someone else held the job recently before him. The film also saw M refer to himself as head of MI7; Lee had originally said MI6, but was overdubbed with the name MI7 prior to the film&#x27;s release. Earlier in the film, the department had been referred to as MI6 by a radio operator.

A number of Bond scholars have noted that Lee&#x27;s interpretation of the character was in line with the original literary representation; Cork and Stutz observed that Lee was &quot;very close to Fleming&#x27;s version of the character&quot;, while Rubin commented on the serious, efficient, no-nonsense authority figure. Smith and Lavington, meanwhile, remarked that Lee was &quot;the very incarnation of Fleming&#x27;s crusty admiral.&quot;

Lee died of cancer in January 1981, four months into the filming of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and before any of his scenes could be filmed. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, with his lines given to either his Chief of Staff Bill Tanner or the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray. Later films referred to Lee&#x27;s tenure as head of the service, with a painting of him as M in MI6&#x27;s Scottish headquarters during the 1999 instalment &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;.

Appearances in:

Lee&#x27;s likeness was used in the 2005 video game &quot;James Bond 007: From Russia with Love&quot;.

====Robert Brown: 1983–1989====

After Lee&#x27;s death in 1981, the producers hired actor Robert Brown to play M in &quot;Octopussy&quot;. Brown had previously played Admiral Hargreaves, Flag Officer Submarines, in the 1977 film, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Bond scholars Steven Jay Rubin, John Cork, and Collin Stutz all consider Admiral Hargreaves would have been appointed to the role of M, rather than Brown playing a different character as M.

Pfeiffer and Worrall considered that whilst Brown looks perfect, the role had been softened from that of Lee; they also considered him &quot;far too avuncular&quot;, although in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; they remarked that he came across as being very effective as he removed Bond&#x27;s double-0 licence. Continuation author Raymond Benson agrees, noting that the M role was &quot;once again under written, and Brown is not allowed the opportunity to explore and reveal his character traits&quot;; Benson also considered the character to be &quot;too nice&quot;. In &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021), Brown&#x27;s M is briefly seen in a portrait at the office of the incumbent M (Ralph Fiennes) opposite a portrait of Judi Dench&#x27;s M.

Appearances in:

* &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983)
* &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985)
* &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987)
* &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989)

====Judi Dench: 1995–2015====

After the long period between &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, the producers brought in Dame Judi Dench to take over as the new M replacing Robert Brown. The character is based on Stella Rimington, the real-life head of MI5 between 1992 and 1996. For &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, Dench&#x27;s M is cold, blunt and initially dislikes Bond, whom she calls a &quot;sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War.&quot; Tanner, her Chief of Staff, refers to her during the film as &quot;the Evil Queen of Numbers&quot;, given her reputation at that stage for relying on statistics and analysis rather than impulse and initiative.

Following Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s departure from the role as Bond, Dench continued playing M for the 2006 film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, which rebooted the series with Daniel Craig playing Bond at the beginning of his career. In this new continuity, M has worked for MI6 for some time, at one point muttering, &quot;Christ, I miss the Cold War&quot;. According to &quot;Skyfall&quot;, M was previously in charge of MI6&#x27;s operations in Hong Kong during the 1990s. Her ability to run MI6 has been questioned more than once; in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, she is the subject of a review when Bond is caught shooting an unarmed prisoner and blowing up a foreign embassy on camera; in &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, the Foreign Secretary orders her to personally withdraw Bond from the field in Bolivia and to stop any investigations into Dominic Greene&#x27;s eco-terrorist organisation; and in &quot;Skyfall&quot;, she is the subject of a public inquiry when MI6 loses a computer hard drive containing the identities of undercover agents around the world. &quot;Skyfall&quot; marked Dench&#x27;s seventh appearance as M, where she is targeted by former MI6 agent Raoul Silva, whom she turned over to the Chinese in order to save six other agents. She assists Bond with making booby traps in preparation of Silva&#x27;s forces coming to attack at Bond&#x27;s old family estate, Skyfall in Scotland. She is shot and wounded before dying from her wounds in the film, making her the only M to die in the Eon Bond films. Dench&#x27;s M makes a final appearance in &quot;Spectre&quot; in a video will, giving Bond a final order to hunt down and terminate someone, which ultimately leads him to the film&#x27;s titular criminal organisation.

In &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021), Dench&#x27;s M is briefly seen in a portrait at M&#x27;s office (Ralph Fiennes) opposite a portrait of Robert Brown&#x27;s M.

There have also been brief references to M&#x27;s family: in &quot;GoldenEye,&quot; she responds to Tanner calling her the &quot;Evil Queen of Numbers&quot; by telling him that when she wants to hear sarcasm she will listen to her children. &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; director Marc Forster suggested that Dench&#x27;s casting gave the character maternal overtones in her relationship with Bond, overtones made overt in &quot;Skyfall&quot;, in which Silva repeatedly refers to her as &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Mommy&quot; . In &quot;Skyfall&quot; she is revealed to be a widow.

An inscribed box following her death in &quot;Skyfall&quot; reveals her name to be Olivia Mansfield, at least for the duration of the Craig era.

Appearances in:

* &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997)
* &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008)
* &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012)
* &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015, cameo)

Dench also appeared in seven James Bond video games:
* &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (2000) – is a playable character
* &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot; (2004)
* &quot;&quot; (2004)
* &quot;007: Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008)
* &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (2010)
* &quot;James Bond 007: Blood Stone&quot; (2010)
* &quot;007 Legends&quot; (2012)

====Ralph Fiennes: 2012–present====

After the death of Dame Judi Dench&#x27;s M at the end of &quot;Skyfall&quot;, she is succeeded by Gareth Mallory, played by Ralph Fiennes. Mallory had been the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee prior to heading MI6, and is a former in the British Army. He served in Northern Ireland (with the Special Air Service) during the Troubles, where he had been held hostage by the Irish Republican Army for three months. In &quot;Spectre&quot;, the 00 Section of MI6 is briefly dismantled in addition to Mallory being demoted. He assists Bond in the field when it is revealed that the Nine Eyes initiative is part of Spectre&#x27;s plan for world domination. In &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, Mallory authorizes the development of Project Heracles, a DNA-targeting nanobot bioweapon. Project Heracles is stolen by Spectre and falls into the hands of Lyutsifer Safin, eventually leading to the death of Bond as he sacrifices his life in order for the weapon to be completely destroyed. Mallory eulogises Bond at the end of the film.

Mallory is the first M in the Eon series whose real name is known from the start, and he continues to be referred to both as M and as Mallory throughout the films.

Appearances in:

* &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012)
* &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015)
* &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021)
===Non-Eon films===
====John Huston/David Niven: 1967====
The 1967 film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; had not one but two Ms. The first is played by John Huston, who also co-directed. In this film, M&#x27;s real name is McTarry and he is accidentally killed when, in order to get Bond out of retirement, he orders the military to fire mortars at Bond&#x27;s mansion when the retired spy refuses to return to duty. The first quarter of the film depicts Bond&#x27;s subsequent visit to McTarry Castle in Scotland, on a quest to return the only piece of M&#x27;s remains recovered after the attack—his bright red toupée. Subsequently, Bond—played by David Niven—becomes the new M and proceeds to order that all MI6 agents, male and female, be renamed &quot;James Bond 007&quot; in order to confuse the enemy.

====Edward Fox: 1983====

In 1983&#x27;s &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, Edward Fox played M as a bureaucrat, contemptuous of Bond—far removed from the relationship shared between Bernard Lee&#x27;s M and Sean Connery&#x27;s Bond; the academic Jeremy Black notes that the contempt felt for the 00 section by Fox&#x27;s M was reciprocated by Connery&#x27;s Bond. Fox&#x27;s M is also younger than any of the previous portrayals, and his portrayal is the only instance to date of the actor playing M being younger than the actor playing Bond. The media historian James Chapman notes that while M considers Bond to be an out-dated relic, the Foreign Secretary orders the 00 section to be re-activated.

==Outside the James Bond series==
Several past incarnations of M appear in Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;. The first, later revealed to be James Moriarty, created and directed the eponymous League in 1898 to win a gang war against Fu Manchu. Following Moriarty&#x27;s death, Mycroft Holmes assumed the role of M. In the sequel volume &quot;The Black Dossier&quot;, Harry Lime, the head of the British secret service, assumed the role of M amidst a moribund and dystopian 1950s post-war Britain. In the final volume &quot;Century&quot;, the elderly Emma Peel assumed the role of M as of 2009.

The James Moriarty incarnation of M appears in the first volume&#x27;s film adaptation, portrayed by Richard Roxburgh.

<text>Adium is a free and open-source instant messaging client for macOS that supports multiple IM networks, including XMPP (Jabber), IRC and more. In the past, it has also supported AIM, ICQ, Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger. Adium is written using macOS&#x27;s Cocoa API, and it is released under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later and many other licenses for components that are distributed with Adium.

==History==
Adium was created by college student Adam Iser, and the first version, &quot;Adium 1.0&quot;, was released in September 2001 and supported only AIM. The version numbers of Adium since then have followed a somewhat unusual pattern. There were several upgrades to Adium 1.0, ending with Adium 1.6.2c.

At this point, the Adium team began a complete rewrite of the Adium code, expanding it into a multiprotocol messaging program. Pidgin&#x27;s (formerly &quot;Gaim&quot;) libpurple (then called &quot;libgaim&quot;) library was implemented to add support for IM protocols other than AIM – since then the Adium team has mostly been working on the GUI. The Adium team originally intended to release these changes as &quot;Adium 2.0&quot;. However, Adium was eventually renamed to &quot;Adium X&quot; and released at version 0.50, being considered &quot;halfway to a 1.0 product&quot;. Adium X 0.88 was the first version compiled as a universal binary, allowing it to run natively on Intel-based Macs.

In 2005, Adium received a &quot;Special Mention&quot; at the Apple Design Awards.

After version Adium X 0.89.1, however, the team finally decided to change the name back to &quot;Adium&quot;, and, as such, &quot;Adium 1.0&quot; was released on February 2, 2007.

Apple Inc. used Adium X 0.89.1&#x27;s build time in Xcode 2.3 as a benchmark for comparing the performance of the Mac Pro and Power Mac G5 Quad, and Adium 1.2&#x27;s build time in Xcode 3.0 as a benchmark for comparing the performance of the eight-core Mac Pro and Power Mac G5 Quad.

On November 4, 2014, Adium scored 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s secure messaging scorecard. It lost a point because there has not been a recent independent code audit.

From March 2019, Adium is no longer able to support the ICQ plugin.

==Protocols==
Adium supports a wide range of instant messaging networks through the libraries libezv (for Bonjour), STTwitterEngine (for Twitter), and libpurple (for all other protocols).

Adium supports the following protocols:
*XMPP (including Google Talk, Facebook Chat, and LiveJournal services)
*Twitter
*Bonjour
*Internet Relay Chat
*Novell GroupWise
*IBM Sametime
*Gadu-Gadu
*Skype with a plugin
*Skype for Business Server (previously Microsoft Lync Server, Microsoft Office Communications Server) with a plugin
*Telegram with a plugin
*Tencent QQ with a plugin
*Steam Chat with the &quot;Steam IM&quot; plugin
*NateOn with a plugin

==Plugins and customization==
Adium makes use of a plug-in architecture; many of the program&#x27;s essential features are actually provided by plugins bundled inside the application package. These plugins include functionality such as file transfer, support for the Growl notifications system, Sparkle for program updates, and support for encrypted messaging with the Off-the-Record Messaging library.

Adium is also highly customizable through the use of resources its developers call &quot;Xtras&quot;. The program can be customized by the use of hundreds of third-party Xtras that alter the appearance of emoticons, dock icons, contact list styles, and messages styles. Adium can also be enhanced through the use of different sound sets. AppleScripts can also be utilized to automatically alter behavior in responses to certain triggers.

== Icon ==
The icon of Adium is a green duck named Adiumy. It is also the mascot of the software.

<doc id="255875" wikidata="Q537118" url="?curid=255875" title="Kung Fu Records">
<text>Kung Fu Records is an American independent record label founded in 1996 by Joe Escalante and Warren Fitzgerald of the punk rock band The Vandals. Founded in order to release a record by the Riverside, California band Assorted Jelly Beans, the label soon grew to include a roster of notable artists such as The Ataris, Ozma, Tsunami Bomb, and The Vandals themselves. In 2000 Escalante started Kung Fu Films as a subsidiary of the music label in order to release DVDs of live concerts, music videos, band documentaries, and independent films. In 2005 Kung Fu also spawned the spinoff label Broken Sounds Records, focusing on hardcore releases.

==History==
Kung Fu Records was founded by Vandals bassist Joe Escalante and guitarist Warren Fitzgerald in 1996. Escalante had been urged by his wife to allow the Riverside, California band Assorted Jelly Beans to open for The Vandals, and he and Fitzgerald were so impressed by their performance that they decided to start a record label in order to release the band&#x27;s debut album.

In 2010, the label and the band Vandals were sued by Daily Variety stating it violated an agreement stemming from a complaint Variety registered in 2004 over the design of the Vandals’ “Hollywood Potato Chip” album cover, looking like the Variety logo. The label won the first round and the case was sent from Delaware to the California courts. The case was finally settled in 2012.

==Offshoots and subsidiary labels==
Kung Fu records has also spawned several subsidiary imprints specializing in particular types of releases. In 2000 Escalante started Kung Fu Films as an offshoot of the label with the release of the independent film &quot;That Darn Punk&quot;, in which he starred. The label also released the internet television series &quot;Fear of a Punk Planet&quot;, which was later released on DVD. Over the years Kung Fu Films has released more independent films, such as 2005&#x27;s &quot;Cake Boy&quot; starring Fitzgerald, and several video compilations showcasing bands from the Kung Fu labels. The film imprint is best known, however, for its series of live concert DVDs grouped under the title &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot; To date there have been 19 &quot;episodes&quot; of the series released. These have included bands signed to Kung Fu Records such as The Vandals and Tsunami Bomb, but more often have branched outside the label to include groups such as Alkaline Trio, Guttermouth, Reel Big Fish, the Circle Jerks, and The Bouncing Souls.

In 2005 Kung Fu Records launched the spinoff imprint Broken Sounds Records to focus on releases by hardcore acts such as the Righteous Jams, The Getaway, xdeathstarx, Suffocate Faster, and H2O. To date, however, the only album to be released under the Broken Sounds imprint has been the Righteous Jams&#x27; &quot;Rage of Discipline&quot;.

==Label compilations==
Much like other independent record labels, Kung Fu has released a series of low-priced compilation samplers designed to draw attention to the label. Originally these compilations did not have a unifying title similar to Epitaph&#x27;s &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot; or Fat&#x27;s &quot;Fat Music&quot; series. However the third sampler was titled &quot;Punk Rock is Your Friend&quot;, and this became the series&#x27; overall name. Future compilations were released as &quot;Punk Rock is Your Friend: Kung Fu Records Sampler #_&quot;, the first such release being #4 even though the first two did not carry the &quot;Punk Rock is Your Friend&quot; title.

<doc id="255880" wikidata="Q13662" url="?curid=255880" title="Bicol Region">
<text>The Bicol Region, designated as Region V, is an administrative region of the Philippines. It comprises six provinces, four on the Bicol Peninsula (the southeastern end of Luzon): Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon, and two off the shore: Catanduanes and Masbate.

The regional center is Legazpi, the most populous city in the region and has one independent component city, the pilgrim city of Naga. The region is bounded by Lamon Bay to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Sibuyan Sea and Ragay Gulf to the west. The northernmost provinces, Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, are bordered to the west by the province of Quezon in the Calabarzon region.

==Geography==
The Bicol Region comprises the southern part of Luzon, the largest island in the Philippine archipelago. The total land area is 5.9% of the total land area of the country. Around 69.3% of the total land area is alienable and disposable while the remaining 30.7% is public forest areas.

==History==

The Bicol region was known as &quot;Ibalong&quot;, variously interpreted to derive from &quot;ibalio&quot;, &quot;to bring to the other side&quot;; ibalon, &quot;people from the other side&quot; or &quot;people who are hospitable and give visitors gifts to bring home&quot;; or as a corruption of &quot;Gibal-ong&quot;, a sitio of Magallanes, Sorsogon where the Spaniards first landed in 1567. The Bicol River was first mentioned in Spanish documents in 1572. The region was also called &quot;Los Camarines&quot; after the huts found by the Spaniards in Camalig, Albay. No prehistoric animal fossils have been discovered in Bicol and the peopling of the region remains obscure. The Aeta from Camarines Sur to Sorsogon strongly suggest that aborigines lived there long ago, but earliest evidence is of middle to late Neolithic life.

A &quot;barangay&quot; (village) system was in existence by 1569. Records show no sign of Islamic rule nor any authority surpassing the datu (chieftain). Precolonial leadership was based on strength, courage, and intelligence. The native seemed apolitical. Thus, the datu&#x27;s influence mattered most during crises like wars. Otherwise, early Bicol society remained family centered, and the leader was the head of the family.

The Spanish influence in Bicol resulted mainly from the efforts of Augustinian and Franciscan Spanish missionaries. The first churches in Bicol, the San Francisco Church, and the Naga Cathedral, both in Naga City, along with the Holy Cross Parish in Nabua, Camarines Sur, are instituted by the Holy Order of the Franciscans. One of the oldest dioceses in the Philippines, the Archdiocese of Caceres, was also instituted in the Bicol Region. During this time, Bicol was dotted by many &quot;astilleros&quot; (shipyards) which were focused on constructing Manila Galleons, the heaviest ships in their time, from the local hardwood forests and these Manila Galleons were responsible for trade between Asia and the Americas. Bicol also has Latin-American settlements and cultural influence mostly from Mexico due to the abundance of chili pepper plantations in the area, as it is Mexican in origin. Bicolano cuisine is noted for the propensity of being spicy. However regardless, the region throughout its history has been among the hardest to control by Spanish, American, and Japanese occupants due to heavy resistance among the populace.

== Administrative divisions ==
=== Provinces ===

The region comprises six provinces: Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon and the island-provinces of Catanduanes and Masbate, 107 Municipalities and 3,471 Barangays

As of 2020, Camarines Sur is the region&#x27;s largest province in area and population, occupying or around 30.4% of the total land area with a population of 2,068,244. Catanduanes is the smallest in area as well as population with only or 8.4% of the total regional area and a population of 271,879.

====Governors and vice governors====

=== Cities ===

The region has one independent component city, Naga, and six component cities – Iriga, Legazpi, Ligao, Masbate City, Sorsogon City, and Tabaco. Masbate and Sorsogon are cities in their eponymous provinces.

==Demographics==

The Bicol Region has a population of 6,082,165 as of 2020 census, growing at an average annual rate of 1.29 percent between 2010 and 2015. The region&#x27;s population density increased to 320 persons per square kilometer in 2015.

In 1970, Camarines Sur was the only province with close to a million population. Albay, which was next in rank, reached the 1970 population level of Camarines Sur only 20 years later. Masbate and Sorsogon were in the same level every census year from 1970 to 1980. It is noteworthy that distribution and growth of the 1970 population were towards areas that were sparsely populated but agriculturally rich and/or endowed with fishery resources. The island province of Catanduanes and its municipalities have exhibited very low population growth from 1970 to 1980.

In 1980, the pattern was towards urbanization. This was due to the pull of newly installed infrastructures, particularly roads, and the sporadic growth of trade in strategically situated municipalities that have better economic opportunities. The 1990 growth originated from the strong attraction of employment opportunities in established urban centers, which have become a source of growth of adjacent municipalities. This situation was highly evident in Naga and Legazpi areas, whose surrounding municipalities exhibited high growth rates. Unmistakably, the spill-over effects of development permeated those initial high growth areas.

Population spill-over happened in the Legazpi, Naga and Daet areas. Due to more population and more opportunities, Naga, Daet and Legazpi spilled their population to their neighboring and adjacent towns.

The Bicolanos are descended from the Austronesian-speaking immigrants who came from Southern China during the Iron Age. Many of Bicolanos also have Chinese, Arab, and Spanish admixtures. Most of the townsfolk have Spanish Mixtures and their language is referred to as Bikol or Bikolano. Bicolanos have a high percentage of Spanish introgression with a government sponsored study showing 2 out of 10 Bicolanos or 2/10ths of the population being of Spanish descent. Only the Chavacanos among the Philippine ethnic groups, have a higher Spanish percentage at 4/10ths of the population, compared to Bicolano&#x27;s 2/10ths, while the average percentage of Spanish descent among other Filipino Lowland Christian Ethnic groups are 6% out of 100%. The Bicolano language is very fragmented, and its dialects are mutually incomprehensible to speakers of other Bicolano dialects. The majority of the Bicolano people are devout Roman Catholics due to the Spanish conquering the country and converting them to their religion. Catholic Mass is celebrated daily in many churches in the Bicol Region.

===Language===

The people of the Bicol Region, called Bicolanos, speak any of the several languages of the Bikol language subgroup, called Bikol macrolanguages, Austronesian languages closely grouped under the Central Philippine languages family such as the Visayan languages and Tagalog. The four major groups of language in Bikol are Coastal Bikol (with four sub-languages), Inland Bikol (with six sub-languages), Pandan Bikol (lone language) and Bisakol (with three sub-languages). The majority of Bicolanos understand and speak Central Bikol language (a member of Coastal Bikol group of languages), since it is the language used in literature and mass media, but with varying degrees. A known misconception of many Bicolanos is that Central Bikol, used in the cities of Legazpi and Naga, is the standard Bikol. Central Bikol, though spoken by the majority and with speakers represented in all provinces in the region, is not a standard Bikol, since other forms of Bikol used in the region are separate languages and usually unintelligible. However, the standard form of Central Bikol language is the Canaman dialect.

Other Bikol languages are Rinconada Bikol, spoken in southern part of Camarines Sur province, Pandan Bikol spoken in northern part of Catanduanes island and the Albay Bikol group of languages that include Buhinon, Libon, West Miraya and East Miraya. Albay Bikol speakers can be found in Buhi, Camarines Sur, central and eastern parts of Albay and in Donsol, Sorsogon. The standard form of Rinconada Bikol both in pronunciation and writing is the Sinabukid (Highland) dialect of Iriga variant. On the other hand, Buhinon of Buhi, Camarines Sur and Libon of Libon, Albay are the languages that are only used in their respective municipalities. Rinconada Bikol and Albay Bikol group of languages are members of Inland Bikol, while Pandan Bikol is the only language with no sub-languages or division.

The majority of the population in Masbate and Sorsogon speaks Masbateño, Waray Sorsoganon and Northern Sorsoganon. The three are Visayan languages but influenced by Bikol languages (especially the latter), thus tagged and collectively referred to as Bisakol (Being Visayan languages spoken in Bicol), a portmanteau of Bisaya (Visayan) and Bikol (Bicolano).

Aside from Masbateño, three more Visayan languages are spoken in Masbate, including Hiligaynon/Ilonggo are spoken in the southwestern tip, while Cebuano and Waray-Waray are spoken in the southern part of the island province respectively. Tagalog is the dominant and native language of Bicolanos living in the municipalities in the northern half of Camarines Norte and the town of Del Gallego in Camarines Sur.

Bicolanos also speak and understand Filipino, the national language of the Philippines, aside from native Tagalog-speaking Bicolanos in northern half of Camarines Norte and Del Gallego. English is widely understood in businesses, schools and public places.

===Religion===
The region retains Roman Catholicism as the overwhelming religion of the great majority. The Catholic religion has the highest number of followers than any other area in the Philippines. The Catholic church grew in the Bicol Region through the efforts of the bishops from Nueva Caceres (Naga City) from the 17th century until the Philippine Revolution in 1898. Naga City is the religious center of the Bicol Region and is the seat of one of the oldest dioceses in the Philippines, the ecclesiastical Archdiocese of Caceres. Other dioceses include are the Dioceses of Legazpi, Sorsogon, Daet, Masbate, Libmanan and Virac. Fiestas (Feast day of saints) are annual celebrations of parishes, from a simple barrio fiesta honoring a patron associated for good harvest, to a town fiesta honoring a miraculous saint, a diocesan fiesta like the feast of Our Lady of Salvation, or a regional one such as the Our Lady of Peñafrancia Fiesta, the largest Marian devotion in Asia, a week-long celebration to honor the Virgin Mary, dubbed as the &quot;Patroness of Bicolandia&quot;. In Luzon, the Bicol Region holds the most men entering the seminary for Catholic priesthood, or women entering the religious life to become Catholic nuns. This can be accredited to the Holy Rosary Minor Seminary, Daughters of Mary, and Daughters of Charity Convents in Naga City.

The largest minority religion in the region is Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) known for its magnificent worship buildings, commonly called chapels or &quot;kapilya&quot;, with towering spires that dot the Bicol landscape. Each province represents one ecclesiastical district (E.D.) with the exception of Camarines Sur which is divided into two – Camarines Southwest E.D. in Naga, and Camarines Southeast E.D. in Iriga City. In total, INC has seven ecclesiastical districts in the Bicol region. The chapel of local congregation of Legazpi, Albay is the biggest.

Other religions are also well represented in Bicol such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Protestants denominations of Seventh-Day Adventist church, Baptist Church, Pentecostal, Islam, and indigenous religions.

Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities. Among these deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Aswang, his brother was trying to steal. Whenever people disobey his orders, wishes and commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways. Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang; Asuang, the evil god who always try to steal the sacred fire of Mount Mayon from his brother, Gugurang. Addressed sometimes as Aswang, he dwells mainly inside Mount Malinao. As an evil god, he would cause the people to suffer misfortunes and commit sins. Enemy of Gugurang and a friend of Bulan the god of the Moon; Haliya, the masked goddess of the moonlight and the archenemy of Bakunawa and protector of Bulan. Her cult is composed primarily of women. There is also a ritual dance named after her as it is performed to be a countermeasure against Bakunawa.; &quot;Bulan&quot;, the god of the pale moon, he is depicted as a pubescent boy with uncommon comeliness that made savage beast and the vicious mermaids (Magindara) tame. He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang&#x27;s grip; &quot;Magindang&quot;, the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the Moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately; &quot;Okot&quot;, god of forest and hunting; and &quot;Bakunawa&quot;, a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the sun and the moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa&#x27;s main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.

===Culture and traits===

The Bicolano cuisine is primarily noted for the prominent use of chili peppers and &quot;gata&quot; (coconut milk) in its food. A classic example is the gulay na lada, known outside the region as Bicol express, a well-loved dish using &quot;siling labuyo&quot; (native small chillies) and the aforementioned &quot;gata&quot;.

Like their other neighboring regions, Bicolanas are also expected to lend a hand in household work. They are even anticipated to offer assistance after being married. On the other hand, Bicolano men are expected to assume the role of becoming the primary source of income and financial support of his family.

Bicolanos are also known for being very religious, the place is known for Señora De Peñafrancia. Bicolanos are often sweet, regionalistic, friendly, adventurous, puts high importance on education and social status. Contrary to what is believed, not all Bicolanos are fond of chili. Men often know how to cook.

===Roads and Bridges===
* Matnog – Santa Magdalena – Bulusan Road – This project was a road improvement of Matnog – Santa Magdalena – Bulusan Road, linking the coastal barangays of Santa Magdalena – Bulusan – Matnog in the province of Sorsogon. This road also serves as an alternate route due to the traffic impairment along Daang Maharlika and also an access road leading to different tourist destination. The project was started on August 6, 2015, and was completed on July 20, 2018.

==Economy==
Bicol Region has a large amount of rich flatland, and agriculture is the largest component of the economy, followed by commercial fishing. Coconuts, abaca, banana, coffee and jackfruit are the top five permanent crops in the region. Rice and corn are among the chief seasonal crops. Coal mining is also one of the contributors to the region&#x27;s economy. Commercial fishing is also important with thirteen major fishing grounds supplying fish markets in places as far as Metro Manila.

Currently, Bicol Region has 13,435 farmers that cultivate 142,405 hectares of pili plantation according the Department of Agriculture-Bicol&#x27;s data. The DA further said that 90% of Philippines&#x27; pili production is from the Bicol Region and it began asexual reproduction for the product&#x27;s export. The resilient tree&#x27;s fruit is 7% kernel, 25% shell and 68% pulp. The Sorsogon Provincial Pili Development Board will petition for the Region&#x27;s declaration as the &quot;Pili Capital of the Philippines&quot;.

In October 2023, the Department of Trade and Industry launched &quot;Orgullo kan Bikol&quot; Trade and Travel Fair at Shangri-La Plaza. The 103 exhibitors are MSMEs which displayed 253 new products from Bikol&#x27;s 6 provinces.

== Tourism ==

The region&#x27;s tourism industry has been revived by the popularity of Mayon Volcano, the new CamSur Water Sports Complex, whale shark spotting, among others, which consequently increased the number of upscale resorts. Naga City has its colonial churches, and pilgrimages to Our Lady of Peñafrancia.

The municipality of Daet and Catanduanes province have long been destinations for surfers. The opening of the Bicol International Airport in Legazpi City was hoped to further boost tourism in the region.

==Geology==
Bicol region is highly volcanic in origin and part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Known as the Bicol Volcanic Arc or Chain, the volcanoes are the results of the Philippine Sea Plate subducting under the Philippine Mobile Belt, along the Philippine Trench. Volcanism is evident by the number of hot springs, crater lakes, and volcanoes that dot the region starting from Mount Labo in Camarines Norte to the Gate Mountains in Matnog, Sorsogon.

Mayon Volcano is the most prominent of the volcanoes in the region, famous for its perfect conical shape and for being the most active in the Philippines. Its eruptions have repeatedly inflicted disasters on the region, but during lulls in activity, it is a particularly magnificent peak. The southernmost tip of the peninsula is dominated by Bulusan Volcano, the other active volcano in the region. Tiwi in Albay and the Bacon-Manito area between Sorsogon and Albay are the sites of two major geothermal fields that contribute substantially to the Bicol Power Grid, which is the only independent power grid in the Philippines.

==Education==
From 1945 until 2011, the basic education system was composed of six years of elementary education starting at the age of 6, and four years of high school education starting at the age of 12. Further education was provided by technical or vocational schools, or in higher education institutions such as universities. Although the 1987 Constitution stated that elementary education was compulsory, this was never enforced.
In 2011, the country started to transition from its old 10-year basic educational system to a K–12 educational system, as mandated by the Department of Education. The new 12-year system is now compulsory, along with the adoption of new curriculum for all schools (see 2010s and the K–12 program). The transition period will end with the 2017–2018 school year, which is the graduation date for the first group of students who entered the new educational system.

All public schools in the Philippines must start classes on the date mandated by the Department of Education (usually the first Monday for public, second Monday for private and third Monday for some colleges for the month of June) since the presidency of Joseph Estrada in 1999, and must end after each school completes the mandated 200-day school calendar organized by the Department of Education (usually around the third week of March to the second week of April). Private schools are not obliged to abide by a specific date but must open classes no later than the last week of August.

<text>Camarines Sur (; ), officially the Province of Camarines Sur (Bikol: &quot;Probinsya kan Habagatan na Camarines&quot;; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Bicol Region on Luzon. Its capital is Pili and the province borders Camarines Norte and Quezon to the northwest, and Albay to the south. To the east lies the island province of Catanduanes across the Maqueda Channel.

Camarines Sur is the largest among the six provinces in the Bicol Region both by population and land area. Its territory includes two cities: Naga, the most-populous, lone chartered and independent city, as the province&#x27;s religious, cultural, financial, commercial, industrial and business center; and Iriga, a component city, as the center of the Rinconada area and Riŋkonāda Language. Within the province lies Lake Buhi, where the smallest commercially harvested fish, the sinarapan (&quot;Mistichthys luzonensis&quot;), can be found. The province is also home to the critically endangered Isarog Agta language, one of the three critically endangered languages in the Philippines according to UNESCO.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest settlers in Camarines Sur are the Isarog Agta people who live within the circumference of Mount Isarog and the Iraya Agta who live within the circumference of Mount Iraya. They have been in the province for thousands of years and have been one of the first settlers in the entire Philippines.

===Spanish occupation===

In July 1569, Luis Enríquez de Guzmán, a member of the expedition led by Maestro de Campo Mateo de Saz and Captain Martín de Goiti, led a group which crossed from Burias and Ticao islands and landed on a coastal settlement called &quot;Ibalon&quot; in what is now the province of Sorsogon. From this point another expedition was sent to explore the interior and founded the town of &quot;Camalig&quot;.

In 1573, Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Juan de Salcedo penetrated the Bicol Peninsula from the north as made it as far south as Libon, establishing the settlement of Santiago de Libon. José María de Peñaranda, the first governor of Albay and a military engineer, was made &quot;corregidor&quot; of the province on 14 May 1834. He constructed public buildings and built roads and bridges. The entire Bicol Peninsula was organized as one province with two divisions, Camarines in the northwest and Ibalon in the southeast. In 1636, the two were separated.

Known centuries ago as the &quot;Tierra de Camarines&quot;, the province is distinctly Spanish-founded settlement. Its name having been derived from &quot;camaronchones&quot; or &quot;camarines&quot;, a Spanish word for &quot;kamalig&quot; referring to small nipa or bamboo-made huts by the natives.

In 1574, Governor-General Guido de Lavezaris referred Camarines Sur to the King of Spain as &quot;Los Camarines&quot;, after the abundance of &quot;camarin&quot;s-rice granaries – which were conspicuous features of the area.

Spanish colonizers later subjugated its people and denominated the area into two distinct aggrupations. 
&quot;Partido de Camarines&quot; was partitioned into &quot;Camarines Sur&quot; and &quot;Camarines Norte&quot; in 1829, and thereafter underwent fusion, annexations and re-partitions until 19 March 1919, when two provinces, jointly called &quot;Ambos Camarines&quot;, were finally separated with their present boundaries by decree of the First Philippine Legislature.

The Philippine Revolution started in Ambos Camarines when Elías Ángeles and Félix Plazo, Filipino corporals in the Spanish Army, sided with revolutionists and fought the local Spanish forces on 17 September 1898. Governor Vicente Zaidín capitulated to the revolutionists on the following day. With the arrival of General Vicente Lukbán, the revolutionary government in the Bicol Region was established.

===American occupation===
The American forces occupied the Bicol Peninsula in January 1900. In March of the same year. General John M. Bell was made the military governor of the southeastern Luzon. Civil government was finally established in Ambos Camarines in April 1901.

===Japanese occupation===
During World War II, Camarines Sur came under Japanese occupation in late December 1941, following the capture of Naga on 18 December, a few days after the Japanese invasion of Legaspi. Guerrilla units were organized by Wenceslao Q. Vinzons that waged underground operations against the Japanese troops stationed in Camarines Sur. After the capture of Vinzons on 8 July 1942, the guerrilla movement was carried on by Lieutenant Francisco Boayes and by the Tangcong Vaca Guerrilla Unit organized by Elías Madrid, Juan Miranda and León Aureus in San Nicolás, Canaman. In April 1945, Camarines Sur was finally liberated from the Japanese invaders against the combined Filipino and American troops in 1945.

The military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were active from 3 January 1942 until 30 June 1946, and the Philippine Constabulary was active from 28 October 1944 to 30 June 1946, in Camarines Sur. The Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were spearheading the local military special operations in Bicol Region with the Bicolano guerrilla units decisively aiding them.

===Religion===

Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities. Among these deities include: 
*Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Asuang, his brother was trying to steal. Whenever people disobey his orders or commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways. Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.
*Asuang, the evil god who always tries to steal the sacred fire of Mount Mayón from his brother, Gugurang. Addressed sometimes as Aswang, he dwells mainly inside Mount Malinao. As an evil god, he would cause the people to suffer misfortunes and commit sins. Enemy of Gugurang and a friend of Bulan, the god of the moon.
*Haliya, the masked goddess of the moonlight and protector of Bulan and the arch-enemy of Bakunawa. Her cult is composed primarily of women. There is also a ritual dance named after her as it is performed to be a counter-measure against Bakunawa.
*Bulan, the god of the pale moon, he is depicted as a pubescent boy with uncommon comeliness that made savage beast and the vicious mermaids (Magindara) tame. He has deep affection towards the sea god Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang&#x27;s grip.
*Magindang, the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the Moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately.
*Bakunawa, a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the Sun and the Moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa&#x27;s main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.
*Okot, god of forest and hunting.

===Languages===
The main languages spoken in Camarines Sur are the Coastal Bikol (especially Central Bikol) and Inland Bikol group of languages. The latter is a group of languages that includes Albay Bikol group and Rinconada Bikol, while the former just consists dialects.

==== Coastal Bikol (Central Bikol) ====
A dialect of Coastal Bikol, called &quot;Coastal Bikol-Partido&quot; is used in the eastern portion of the province around Lagonoy Gulf, and another dialect called &quot;Coastal Bikol-Central&quot; is spoken around Naga City.

The Canaman dialect of Central Bikol variant of &quot;Coastal Bikol&quot; spoken in Canaman, Camarines Sur is said to be the &quot;purest&quot; form of Bikol (according to Jesuit anthropologist Frank Lynch, S.J.), though most linguists just consider it as the standard form of Central Bikol language since other Coastal Bikol languages, Rinconada Bikol and Buhinon (both Inland Bikol) are separate languages.

==== Rinconada Bikol ====
The Rinconada Bikol also known as Riŋkonāda (under the umbrella of Inland Bikol group of languages), is used by most people in the Rinconada area or district of the province especially in Nabua, Iriga City and by people of Rinconada in diaspora. &quot;Buhinon&quot; (one of the languages of Albay Bikol group, another member of Inland Bikol), is a minority language spoken in the town of Buhi and around Lake Buhi. Most inhabitants of Camarines Sur understand Tagalog and English.

====Isarog Agta====
In 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the &quot;Isarog Agta&quot; language which has an estimated 5 speakers in the year 2000. The language was classified as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot;, meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Isarog Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.

The Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.

=== Urban history ===

Camarines Sur had urban areas since the Spanish Colonial Period with Naga City (or Nueva Caceres) becoming urban in the 19th century due to it being the center of commerce in the former province of Ambos Camarines. Nabua (Which formerly included present day Balatan), Libmanan (Then included present day Cabusao and some barangays of Canaman Pamplona and Pasacao), Sipocot, Pili, Calabanga, Iriga then followed Nueva Caceres with some barangays being classified as urban.

By the late 1990s the remaining rural municipalities were Siruma, Garchitorena, Presentacion and Cabusao. Until 2007 when all of these 4 municipalities were classified as urban by the National Statistics Office.

==Economy==
The economy of Camarines Sur is mostly agriculture-based. 29 of the 35 towns are agricultural and produce rice, corn, feedmeal, freshwater fish, livestock, coconut, sugar, abacá, and water-lily.

Entrepreneurs engage in trading, often branching out towards neighboring provinces in the south as local demand might be limited by the 3rd to 5th income-class municipalities. Handicrafts are the major source of rural income, providing a fairly large share in the small-scale industries of the province. Forestry and papermaking are other sources of livelihood. The manufacture of abacá products such as Manila hemp, hats, bags, mats, and slippers is one of the main sources of income in the rural areas. Fishing is also done along both shores of the province. Tourism, primarily because of Caramoan and Mount Isarog, also generates income for Camarines Sur.

Naga and several towns have a tri-economy or three-base economy: commerce, industry, and agriculture. As the main center in the Bicol Region, all of the products from other provinces in the region are brought to Naga. It has four major industries: the manufacture of jewelry and gifts/toys/housewares, and processing of pineapple and coconut. Naga also has vast cornfields, rice fields, and water lily farms all over the city.

Calabanga, Cabusao, Libmanan and Sipocot have similar economies to Naga City. Calabanga has commerce from goods moving out of Naga, and is the trade center for the towns of Tinambac, Bombon, Cabusao, and Siruma and further Mercedes in Camarines Norte. Calabanga also has fishing from the Quipayo Fishing Center (the largest in Bicol), and vast productions of corn, sugar, and rice, which benefit from a large granary. Libmanan has 156 hectares of ricefields and cornfields, and fishing along its coastline connecting the towns of Ragay and Pasacao; Libmanan also has a commercial district. Sipocot has an agricultural base economy, with an abundant stock of native chicken (Sipocot&#x27;s OTOP) and wide production of calamansi and other vegetables, while also serving as trading post for towns of Cabusao, Lupi, Del Gallego, Libmanan Ragay and Mercedes (Camarines Norte) Tagkawayan (Quezon Province) . Fish products from these towns are received by Sipocot. Other towns not mentioned have a fishing industry as the main base of their economy.

Naga City, Iriga City, and Pili are the main economic centers of Camarines Sur.

The towns of Nabua, Goa, Calabanga, Libmanan, Pasacao, Sipocot, Baao are also taking successful steps towards urbanization and competitiveness.

Milaor, Camaligan, Canaman, Magarao, Gainza serves as a sub-urban area of Naga City.

The rest of the province takes a long time to urbanize due to lack of major roads, or isolation from business centers.

<text>Camarines Norte (; ), officially the Province of Camarines Norte (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Bicol Region in Luzon. Its capital is Daet, the most populous town in the province. The province borders Quezon to the west, Camarines Sur to the south, and the Philippine Sea to the north. It has historically been a Bikol-speaking region. However, there has been a language shift in recent years to Tagalog, which is more commonly used nowadays.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Juan de Salcedo, dispatched by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi to explore the island in 1571, influenced the existence of Camarines Norte. After subduing Taytay and Cainta, he marched further across Laguna and Tayabas. He visited the rich gold-laden town of Mambulao and Paracale, obsessed by them about which he heard from natives there of existing gold mines.

In 1573, Bicol province was founded. From Bicol, the province of Camarines was created in 1636, which was divided in 1829, creating Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur.

When Camarines Norte was separated from Ambos Camarines in 1829, it was assigned the towns of Daet, as capital, Talisay, Indan (now Vinzons), Labo, Paracale, Mambulao (now Jose Panganiban), Capalonga, Ragay, Lupi and Sipocot.

Seventeen years later, it lost Sipocot, Lupi and Ragay to Camarines Sur in exchange for the town of Siruma.

Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur provinces were briefly merged from 1854 to 1857 into Ambos Camarines (&quot;ambos&quot; is Spanish for &quot;both&quot;). In 1858, these provinces were separated and were merged into Ambos Camarines once again in 1893.

When Francisco de Sande took over from Legazpi as governor general, Spanish influence started to be felt in the region. He established a permanent Spanish garrison in Naga to control the region and defend it from Chinese and Muslim pirates. Capt. Pedro de Chavez was assigned to head this force.

Native settlements, which include Mambulao and Paracale, were already thriving when the Spaniards arrived. Indan and Daet were the other settlements besides Capalonga. But Paracale remained the most sought after because of its gold mines.

The towns were chiefly inhabited by Tagalogs; the rests were of Visayan strain. However, most of the immigrants were from Mauban, Quezon. The Spanish missionaries established missions to Christianize the natives.

====Daet revolt====
From April 14–17, 1898, local members of the Katipunan led by Ildefonso Moreno and other patriots staged an uprising against the Spanish authorities here who have fortified themselves in the house of one Florencio Arana, a Spanish merchant and a long time resident of Daet. Sporadic encounters started on April 14 until April 16 when the rebels occupied Daet and surrounded the Spaniards in the house of Arana. But the Katipuneros failed to repulse the reinforcements which arrived in Barra (now Mercedes) from Nueva Caceres on April 17. Said reinforcements broke the siege of Daet. This resulted in the death and/or execution of many patriots, including Ildefonso Moreno, Tomas Zaldua and his two sons, Jose Abaño, Domingo Lozada and Aniceto Gregorio, among others. While the Daet revolt collapsed, it signaled the start of a series of rebellion throughout the Bicol region.

===American era===

During the American era, Ambos Camarines province was divided into Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur once again in 1917.

By virtue of &quot;Act 2809&quot; of March 3, 1919, Governor General F. B. Harrison separated Camarines Norte from Camarines Sur with the installation of Don Miguel R. Lukban as its first governor. &quot;In functional sense, April 15, 1920, was the date of the organization of Camarines Norte, as directed by &quot;Executive Order No. 22&quot; dated March 20, 1920, in conformity with the provisions of &quot;Act No. 2809&quot;,&quot; according to Serafin D. Quiason, former chairman of the National Historical Institute (NHI).

===Japanese occupation ===
The first guerrilla encounter in the Philippines during the second world war in the Pacific occurred on December 18, 1941 – 11 days after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941 and 10 days after the attack on Clark Airbase in Pampanga on Dec. 8, 1941 - at Laniton, Basud, Camarines Norte when the Vinzons guerrilla group with some elements of USAFFE units engaged the vanguard of the Japanese Imperial Army advancing towards Daet, the capital town. A shrine was put up in Laniton to mark this historic feat of arms while surviving veterans and the sons and daughters of veterans who fell commemorate this event every Dec. 18 in Basud and Daet under the auspices of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines – Camarines Norte Chapter (VFP-CN), Basud Municipal Government and the Provincial Government.

The general headquarters of Philippine Commonwealth Army started their operations on January 3, 1942. The Philippine Constabulary in Camarines Norte was then established on October 28, 1944. When the U.S. liberation forces returned to the province in 1945, they helped the local Filipino troops and Bicolano guerrillas in the liberation from the Japanese Imperial forces.

===Philippine independence===
==== Under the Marcos dictatorship ====
On the evening of September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos announced on television that he had placed the Philippines, including Camarines Norte, under martial law. The Philippines remained under a formal state of Martial Law until January 17, 1981, but Marcos retained essentially all of his powers as dictator after the formal end of Martial Law. The country thus remained under one-man rule for a total of fourteen years ending only when Marcos was deposed by the February 1986 People Power revolution.

On June 14, 1982 Marcos administration forces opened fire on protesters from different barrios, who were marching to demand an increase in copra prices, and to denounce &quot;fake elections&quot; and Cocofed. Four people died on the spot, and at least 50 were injured. Two of those who were seriously wounded died two months later. This has come to be known as the &quot;1981 Daet massacre,&quot; and four of those killed have since been honored by having their names engraved on the Wall of Remembrance at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani memorial.

===Religion===

Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities. Among these deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Aswang, his brother was trying to steal. Whenever people disobey his orders, wishes and commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways. Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.; Asuang, the evil god who always tries to steal the sacred fire of Mount Mayon from his brother, Gugurang. Addressed sometimes as Aswang, he dwells mainly inside Mount Malinao. As an evil god, he would cause the people to suffer misfortunes and commit sins. Enemy of Gugurang and a friend of Bulan the god of the moon; Haliya, the masked goddess of the moonlight and the arch-enemy of Bakunawa and protector of Bulan. Her cult is composed primarily of women. There is also a ritual dance named after her as it is performed to be a counter-measure against Bakunawa.; &quot;Bulan&quot;, the god of the pale moon, he is depicted as a pubescent boy with uncommon comeliness that made savage beast and the vicious mermaids (Magindara) tame. He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang&#x27;s grip; &quot;Magindang&quot;, the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the Moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately; &quot;Okot&quot;, god of forest and hunting; and &quot;Bakunawa&quot;, a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the Sun and the Moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa&#x27;s main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.

===Language===
The Central Bikol dialect has historically been the main language spoken in the province. Tagalog is slowly taking over as the most common language and English is also widely understood and used in businesses and education. The Manide language is also spoken in minority by the Manide indigenous peoples, concentrated mainly on the towns of Jose Panganiban, Labo, and Paracale. 

Camarines Norte is unique among the Tagalog provinces for its proximity to the Bikol region. The proximity of Tagalog speakers in Camarines Norte, especially in crossroads, has created a unique variety of Tagalog which is enriched by Bikol in different aspects including phonology, morphology, grammar and even discourse. Based on the findings of the dialectology done by Andrew Rey Sosa Pena, three dialect areas have been suggested. The first ones would be Sta. Elena, Capalonga, Jose Panganiban, and Paracale, which are relatively uninfluenced by Bikol but rather have similar dialect spoken in nearby Quezon Province. The second dialect area is composed of Labo and Vinzons, which have developed a unique dialect in which the people of Camarines Norte talk about &quot;Salitang Vinzons&quot; and &quot;Salitang Labo&quot;. The third dialect area is composed of Daet, San Vicente, Talisay, Mercedes, Basud, and San Lorenzo Ruiz, which have a high concentration of Bikol speakers and where Tagalog is highly influenced by Bikol vocabulary, phonology, and grammar. 

==Economy==

The province&#x27;s economy largely depends on agriculture, with grain crops, vegetables, coconuts, root crops and fruits, but they are well known with small sweet pineapple.

The four major manufacturing and processing industries in the province are mining (particularly gold and iron ore), jewelry craft, pineapple and coconut industry.

Other sources of the province&#x27;s economical stability are from the growth of numbers in terms of tourists. The province offers various attractions for foreign people, i.e. beaches, mountains, and religious places.

===Infrastructure===
The province has an international seaport located at Barangay Osmeña, Jose Panganiban town servicing one of its major industries, Pan Century Surfactants. The seaport is approximately from the town proper and an hour ride to the capital town of Daet.

<text>James Albert Varney Jr. (June 15, 1949 – February 10, 2000) was an American actor and comedian. He is best known for his comedic role as Ernest P. Worrell, for which he won an Emmy Award, as well as appearing in films and numerous television commercial advertising campaigns. He played Jed Clampett in a film adaptation of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1993) and also covered a song for the film titled &quot;Hot Rod Lincoln&quot;. He voiced Slinky Dog in the first two films of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise (1995–1999). He died of lung cancer on February 10, 2000, leaving two posthumous releases, &quot;Daddy and Them&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Varney was born in Lexington, Kentucky, the son of Nancy Louise (&quot;née&quot; Howard; 1913–1994), and James Albert Varney Sr. (1910–1985). As a child, he displayed the ability to memorize long poems and significant portions of the material from books, which he used to entertain family and friends. When Varney was a boy, his mother would turn on cartoons for him to watch. His mother discovered that Varney quickly began to imitate the cartoon characters, so she started him in children&#x27;s theater when he was eight years old. Varney began his interest in theater as a teenager, winning state titles in drama competitions while a student at Lafayette High School (class of 1968) in Lexington.

At the age of 15, he portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in a local theater production; by 17, he was performing professionally in nightclubs and coffee houses. Varney studied Shakespeare at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, and performed in an Opryland folk show in its first year of operation, in the 1970s. He listed a former teacher, Thelma Beeler, as being a mentor in his becoming an actor. When he was 24, Varney was an actor at the Pioneer Playhouse in Danville, Kentucky. The theater was adjacent to an Old West-themed village, and before the show, the audience would tour the village where apprentices would play townsfolk. Varney and the company usually played in the outdoor theater to audiences of only a few dozen people. He entertained the young apprentices by throwing knives into trees. He performed in &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, &quot;Boeing 707&quot; and an original musical, &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;. He once jokingly threatened a long-haired apprentice, John Lino Ponzini, that he would take him up to Hazard, Kentucky, where &quot;you [Ponzini] wouldn&#x27;t make it down Main Street without the townsfolk giving you a crewcut&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===
Varney had an established acting career before his fame as Ernest. In 1976, Varney was a regular cast member of the television show &quot;Johnny Cash and Friends&quot;. He also played a recurring guest on the faux late-night talk show &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot;. From 1977 to 1979, Varney was cast as Seaman &quot;Doom &amp; Gloom&quot; Broom in the television version of &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;. Just prior to his stint as Ernest, he was a cast member on the notorious television flop &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff&quot;. In 1978, Varney played Milo Skinner on the TV show &quot;Alice&quot;.

===Work for Carden and Cherry===
Varney&#x27;s best-known character is Ernest P. Worrell, who would address the camera as if speaking to a friend, using his trademarked catchphrase &quot;KnoWhutImean, Vern?&quot; In 1980, the first commercial featuring the character advertised an appearance by the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders at Beech Bend Park, an amusement park located near Bowling Green, Kentucky. The character was franchised for use in markets all over the country and was often used by dairies to advertise milk products. For example, the ice cream and hamburger chain Braum&#x27;s ran several advertisements featuring Ernest; Purity Dairies, based in Nashville, Pine State Dairy in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Oakhurst Dairy in Maine ran commercials that were nearly identical, but with the dairy name changed.

For the same agency, Varney created a different character, Sgt. Glory, a humorless drill instructor who harangued cows of the client dairy into producing better milk. In another spot, Sgt. Glory&#x27;s home was shown, which was so heavily decorated with the products of the sponsor and advertising specialty items that it was essentially devoid of any other decor. The Sgt. Glory character also appeared in an advertisement for a Southern grocery chain, Pruett&#x27;s Food Town, in which he drilled the checkout clerks on proper behavior: &quot;Bread on top. Repeat: Bread on top.&quot; He approaches one of them at the end of the commercial with a look of menace and says, &quot;You&#x27;re not smilin&#x27;.&quot; The checkout bagger gives a very nervous and forced smile.

Varney also starred as Ernest in a series of commercials that ran in the New Orleans area (and throughout the Gulf South) as a spokesman for natural gas utilities. In one, he is seen kneeling down in front of Vern&#x27;s desk under a lamp hanging from the ceiling, stating, &quot;Natural gas, Vern; it&#x27;s hot, fast, and cheap. Hot, fast, cheap; kinda like your first wife, Vern, you know, the pretty one!?&quot; Vern then knocks the lamp into Ernest&#x27;s head, knocking him down. Those same television advertisements also were featured on channels in the St. Louis area for Laclede Gas Company during the mid-1980s and in the metro Detroit area for Michigan Consolidated Gas Company. Another TV ad for Laclede Gas featured Ernest saying, &quot;Heat pump, schmeat pump.&quot;

Varney also appeared in several Braum&#x27;s Ice Cream and Dairy Stores commercials throughout the 1980s. These aired on Oklahoma television. He made commercials for car dealerships across the country, most notably Cerritos Auto Square in Cerritos, California, Tysons Toyota in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and Audubon Chrysler in Henderson, Kentucky.

Varney portrayed Ernest in a series of commercials for Convenient Food Mart during the 1980s. In 1982, Varney co-hosted the syndicated &quot;Pop! Goes the Country&quot; with singer Tom T. Hall. The show had just had a major overhaul and ended shortly afterward. He also portrayed &quot;Auntie Nelda&quot; in numerous commercials; dressed in drag and appearing to be a senior citizen, the commercials gave off the tone of &quot;Auntie Nelda&quot; as a motherly lady encouraging one to do what was right (in this case, buy whatever product was being promoted). This character, along with the &quot;Ernest&quot; character, ran for a few years in Mississippi and Louisiana in commercials for Leadco Aluminum Siding, before it became a regular in the Ernest films. Varney also appeared as Ernest in on-air promos for local TV stations in several markets, talking about their news and weather personalities.

During the 1990s, Varney reprised his role as Ernest for Blake&#x27;s Lotaburger, a fast-food chain in New Mexico. In these commercials, Ernest typically would be trying to get into Vern&#x27;s house to see what food Vern was eating. After a lengthy description of whatever tasty morsel Vern had, Ernest would get locked out but would continue to shout from outside.

===Ernest&#x27;s popularity===

The character of Ernest became widely popular, and was the basis for a short-lived TV series, &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Ernest!&quot; (1988) and a series of films in the 1980s and 1990s.

&quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot; (1987) grossed $23.5 million at the U.S. box office, on a $3.5 million production budget, and stayed in the box-office top five for its first three weeks of release. Though Varney was nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst New Star, only one year later, he earned the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children&#x27;s Series for &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Ernest!&quot; Subsequent theatrically released Ernest films include &quot;Ernest Saves Christmas&quot; (1988), &quot;Ernest Goes to Jail&quot; (1990), &quot;Ernest Scared Stupid&quot; (1991), and &quot;Ernest Rides Again&quot; (1993). After the financial failure of &quot;Ernest Rides Again&quot;, all further films were released direct-to-video: &quot;Ernest Goes to School&quot; (1994) which had a limited theatrical run in Ohio and Kentucky, &quot;Slam Dunk Ernest&quot; (1995), &quot;Ernest Goes to Africa&quot; (1997), and &quot;Ernest in the Army&quot; (1998).

The Walt Disney World Resort&#x27;s Epcot theme park featured Ernest. Epcot&#x27;s Cranium Command attraction used the Ernest character in its preshow as an example of a &quot;lovable, but not the brightest person on the planet&quot; type of person. In addition to his &quot;Ernest Goes to...&quot; series, he starred as Ernest in several smaller films for John R. Cherry III, such as &quot;Knowhutimean? Hey Vern, It&#x27;s My Family Album&quot;; &quot;Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam&quot;; and the direct-to-video feature &quot;Your World as I See It&quot;, all of which showcased him in a wide variety of characters and accents.

===Other roles===

From 1983 to 1984, Varney played heartthrob Chad Everett&#x27;s younger brother Evan Earp in the comedy-drama, high-action television series &quot;The Rousters&quot;, created by Stephen J. Cannell, about the descendants of Wyatt Earp, a family of bounty hunters/carnival bouncers. As Evan Earp, Varney played a con man/mechanical-inventor &quot;genius,&quot; constantly getting himself into comedic trouble, with those around him ready to lynch him. Although the series was promising, the show failed after its first season because it was poorly slotted (four episodes every few months) against the number-one prime-time television series for the previous six years, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

Varney can be seen in Hank Williams Jr.&#x27;s video for &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot;, in which he is briefly shown casually riding a bull being pulled on a rope by a young lady, and later in a swimming pool with two young ladies.

In 1985, Varney co-hosted HBO&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve special, along with Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson. Varney also starred as Jed Clampett in the 1993 production of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;; played Rex, a carnival worker/associate of Dennis Quaid in &quot;Wilder Napalm&quot;; and played the accident-prone entertainer/watch guard (&quot;safety guy/human torch&quot;) Rudy James in the film &quot;Snowboard Academy&quot;. He later played a small role in the 1995 action film &quot;The Expert&quot; as a weapons dealer named Snake.

Varney also voiced Slinky Dog in the first two films of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, with his friend Blake Clark replacing him following his death. Varney played numerous other characters, including &quot;Cookie&quot; Farnsworth, from &quot;&quot;, released the year after his death (Steven Barr replaced Varney for the sequel &quot;&quot;), the carny character Cooder in the &quot;Bart Carny&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the character Walt Evergreen in the &quot;Duckman&quot; episode &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Wrong Way, Baby&quot;, Prince Carlos Charmaine (a royal suitor Jackie dates) for a few episodes of the final season of the 1990s television series &quot;Roseanne&quot;, and Lothar Zogg in the 1998 film &quot;3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain&quot;, also starring Hulk Hogan and Loni Anderson.

Varney had a brief role as an incestuous, abusive father in an independent film, &quot;100 Proof&quot;, for which he received good reviews from critics. He also played a rebel in the midnight movie &quot;Existo&quot;, as well as an old mariner in a low-budget horror film, &quot;Blood, Friends, and Money&quot;. During the filming of &quot;Treehouse Hostage&quot;, he played an escaped convict held hostage and tormented by some fifth graders in a treehouse.

One of Varney&#x27;s final films was Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Daddy and Them&quot;, in which he played Uncle Hazel, who had been arrested for murder. Co-stars included Kelly Preston and Andy Griffith. Another final guest appearance was the &quot;Bibleman&quot; Genesis series &quot;Bibleman Jr. Volume 1 &amp; 2&quot; as himself. Varney starred in three videos, &quot;The Misadventures of Bubba&quot;, &quot;The Misadventures of Bubba II&quot;, and &quot;Bubba Goes Hunting&quot;, in which he played himself and taught young kids important safety rules about hunting and guns. He illustrated the rules with the help of his bumbling and accident-prone cousin Bubba (also played by Varney) and Bubba&#x27;s nephew, Billy Bob. The videos were distributed as part of a membership pack from Buckmasters&#x27; Young Bucks Club.

According to an interview, one of his final projects was writing a screenplay about the legendary Hatfield–McCoy feud, stating that his grandfather hunted squirrel with the Hatfields. Varney also allegedly had been hoping to acquire more serious acting roles before his death, wanting to step outside the typecast of Ernest.

==Personal life==
Varney was married twice, first to Jacqueline Drew (1977–1983) and then to Jane Varney (1988–1991). Both marriages ended in divorce, although he remained friends with his ex-wife Jane until his death; she became Varney&#x27;s spokeswoman and accompanied him in Pixar&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. Neither union resulted in children.

On December 6, 2013, Varney&#x27;s nephew Justin Lloyd published a comprehensive biography about his uncle titled &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest: The Life of Actor Jim Varney (Stuff that Vern doesn&#x27;t even know)&quot;. The same year, director Cherry released a Varney biography called &quot;Keeper of the Clown&quot;.

, director David Pagano and &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot; cast member Daniel Butler are planning to release a documentary about Varney called &quot; The Importance of Being Ernest&quot;.

Varney was an accomplished mountain dulcimer player and played the instrument on the last episode of &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Varney was a long-time chain smoker. During the filming of &quot;Treehouse Hostage&quot; in August 1998, Varney developed a nagging cough, which he initially believed to be caused by a cold. However, as his condition worsened, Varney sought medical treatment and was diagnosed with lung cancer.

In response to his illness, Varney reportedly quit smoking to continue performing. He eventually returned to Tennessee, where he underwent chemotherapy and eventually died on February 10, 2000, at his home in White House, Tennessee, at the age of 50. He was buried in Lexington Cemetery in Lexington, Kentucky.

&quot;&quot;, which was released in 2001, was Varney&#x27;s last film role, and dedicated to his memory.

<text>A climbing route () is a path by which a climber reaches the top of a mountain, a rock face or an ice-covered obstacle. The details of a climbing route are recorded in a climbing guidebook and/or in an online climbing-route database. Details recorded will include elements such as the type of climbing route (e.g. bouldering route, sport climbing route, traditional climbing route, ice climbing route, and alpine climbing route, etc.), the difficulty grade of the route–and beta on its crux(es)–and any risk or commitment grade, the length and number of pitches of the route, and the climbing equipment (e.g. climbing protection gear) that is needed to complete the route.

There are definitions as to what is a valid ascent of a route (e.g. the redpoint in rock climbing), and the class or style of ascent (e.g. onsighted, flashed). The coveted first ascent (FA), first free ascent (FFA), and first female free ascent (FFFA), are usually recorded for important routes. After a route is established, variations can be created (e.g. directessimas, sit starts, or enchainments), and climbers will try to improve the &quot;style&quot; in which the route is climbed (e.g. minimizing aid climbing or other supports such as oxygen or fixed ropes). Some climbers limit the in-situ protection (e.g. greenpointing), or even free solo the route. Others seek to set speed climbing records on routes.

The ascent of ever-harder routes is an integral key part of the history of climbing, and each type of climbing has notable routes that set major new milestones. There are ongoing debates amongst climbers about routes including the naming of routes, the creation of new routes by artificially altering the surface (e.g. chipping in rock climbing), the role of completely artificial indoor routes (e.g. &quot;The Project&quot;), the level and maintenance of in-situ protection on routes (e.g. providing permanent bolted protection anchors) and the ethical issue of retro-bolting (e.g. turning traditional climbing routes into safer sport climbing bolted routes).

== Details==

Climbing routes are usually chronicled in a climbing guidebook, a climbing journal (e.g. the &quot;American Alpine Journal&quot; or the &quot;Himalayan Journal&quot;), and/or in an online route database (e.g. &quot;theCrag.com&quot; or &quot;MountainProject.com&quot;), where the key details of the route are listed, which generally include the following:

* Climbing area (or crag). Routes are often clustered together in a general &quot;climbing area&quot;, which is also known as a &quot;crag&quot;. Notable climbing areas include: El Capitan (for big wall climbing in the US), Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu (for traditional climbing in the UK), Buoux, Verdon Gorge and Ceuse (for sport climbing in France).
* Route name. While rock and modern ice climbing routes can have any name, offensive names are removed from databases and guidebooks. In countries such as France the person who created the route names it, whereas in others such as the US and UK, the first person to ascend the route names it (e.g. the &quot;Realization/Biographie&quot; controversy). Alpine routes tend to have names based on the peak or the first ascender and the geological feature, such as the &quot;Bonatti Pillar&quot; or the &quot;Walker Spur&quot;.
* Type and condition of the surface. Different types of rock, such as limestone, granite, or sandstone, present different challenges in terms of friction and types of holds. The typical condition of the rock (e.g. solid or crumbling, or dry and damp) might be noted. Ice climbers will differentiate between the type of ice (e.g. water ice, permanent alpine ice), and the stability of the ice surface (e.g. sheet ice, thick ice).
* Type of climb and equipment requirements. A key detail is whether climbing protection is already in-situ (i.e. sport climbing), or must be inserted while climbing (i.e. traditional climbing). The protection equipment needed on traditional climbing routes will vary depending on the type of challenge presented (e.g. crack climbing, slab climbing, etc.). Some routes may require aid climbing and/or abseiling equipment.
* Length and number of pitches. A key detail is the length of the route, which can vary from a few metres for a bouldering route, to several thousand metres for a big wall climbing or alpine climbing route. Longer routes are broken up into &quot;pitches&quot;, which are less than a rope length; climbers will lead each pitch one at a time. For example, &quot;The Nose&quot; is over 880-metres long, and breaks up into 31-pitches.
* Graphical topo of the route. Most guidebooks will include a photograph or drawing showing the line of the route. For more complicated routes (and for longer multi-pitch routes), a more detailed &quot;topo&quot; (short for topographic) illustration will include symbols for key obstacles (e.g. roofs, overhangs, aretes) and key features (e.g. corners, cracks) encountered on the route; and information on the crux(es).
* Grade of technical difficulty and risk. Routes are graded for their technical difficulty – particularly for the crux(es) – and the availability of adequate protection. Each route type will use the appropriate grading system such as: boulder grades, sport grades, traditional grades, aid grades, or ice grades. Big wall grade and alpine grade systems have additional grades for the level of commitment and seriousness of the route.
* Estimated timings (for longer routes). Multi-pitch climbs and the even-longer big wall and alpine climbs will include details of the estimated timetable for the route, which might go from hours to several days and weeks. These timings may include additional information on key milestones that need to be reached in a given time to achieve the overall route timetable and to complete the route safely with sufficient provisions.
* History of first ascent (FA), first free ascent (FFA), and first female free ascent (FFFA). Guidebooks record the first person(s) to do the FA, FFA, and FFFA of the route. Information may be recorded regarding the &quot;style&quot; of the ascent and whether it was practiced beforehand by top roping. The level of aid used for the FA might be recorded, as well as near-FFAs that used minor aid. On alpine routes, the first winter ascent is recorded.
* Popularity and other feedback. Modern guidebooks will also include some manner of popularity rating for individual routes in a climbing area (e.g. awarding 3-stars to the most popular/best-regarded routes, which are often called &quot;classics&quot;). They may also include additional climber feedback (or beta) on the route such as whether it requires muscle power, balance/footwork, or strong fingers to be successful.

== Terminology ==
===Types of routes===

Climbers will often differentiate climbing routes by the general types of challenges they present. For example, in rock-climbing the four main types of challenges are:

* Crack climbing, are routes following a system of crack(s) that the climber uses to ascend the route; the width of the crack dictates the techniques needed, and crack-climbs are further differentiated by the body parts that can be &#x27;jammed&#x27; into them.
* Face climbing, where the rock face is fully vertical, unlike in slab climbing, and is largely featureless, unlike in crack climbing; face-climbing routes are typically sustained and exposed, and longer multi-pitch routes can become big wall climbing.
* Slab climbing, where the rock face is &#x27;off-angle&#x27; and not fully vertical; while the softer angle enables climbers to place more of their body weight on their feet, slab climbs maintain the challenge by having smaller holds.
* Overhang (or roof) climbing, where the rock face leans back at an angle of over 90 degrees for part or all of the climb, and at its most severe can be a horizontal roof; most of the hardest modern climbs are continuously overhanging.

Similiarly, in alpine climbing or in mountaineering, climbers will distinguish between routes — or parts of routes — that are mainly in sheltered couloirs or gullys from routes that are mainly on exposed arêtes or buttresses, as it they may require different types of equipment and/or techniques to overcome.

===Types of ascents===
The definition of what is classed as a valid ascent of a climbing route is a redpoint. Many routes may not be climbed on the first attempt, and will require days (and in some cases, years) of attempts; when a climber undertakes such a task, it is sometimes called projecting a route (i.e. the route becomes a &quot;project&quot;). When a climber does climb the route on their first attempt without any falls and without any prior knowledge of how to climb the route (which is called beta), it is known as an onsight; where the climber had prior beta on the route, it is known as a flash. Alpine climbers distinguish whether the ascent was made in summer or in the more difficult winter season (e.g. it was not until 2021 that K2 was climbed in winter).
Climbers will also seek to improve the &quot;style&quot; in which a route is climbed. A route that uses a lot of aid climbing will be reclimbed with less and less aid until it is eventually &quot;free climbed&quot; (i.e. using no aid, either as a sport or a traditional climb). Greenpointing refers to the process of even removing any existing in-situ sport climbing protection bolts to ascend the route as a cleaner traditional climb. Alpine climbers seek to complete established high-altitude &quot;expedition style&quot; routes in alpine style with no supplemental oxygen or any fixed ropes, and even alone. Free solo climbers seek to ascend a route with no protection equipment whatsoever (e.g. as in the 2018 film, &quot;Free Solo&quot;). Some big wall climbers set speed records on routes (e.g. &quot;The Nose&quot;).

===Variations of routes===
When a climbing route has been established, variations may be added, a typical one being a more &quot;direct&quot; line (e.g. a direct start or direct finish) of the original route, also called a &quot;direttissima&quot; in alpine climbing, and thus not avoiding the difficult obstacles that the original route went around (e.g. a roof or an overhang, or a section with minimal holds). Boulder climbers might add a harder sit start &quot;SS&quot; (or sit-down-start, &quot;SDS&quot;) variation to a boulder route (e.g. the SDS of &quot;Dreamtime&quot; is graded well above the standing start version). Alpine and big wall climbers often seek to link established routes together in a larger enchainment (or &quot;link-up&quot;) route (e.g. the notable &quot;Moonwalk Traverse&quot; of the entire Cerro Chaltén Group in Patagonia).

The straightforward and frequently used (and usually easiest and often the original) route up a mountain peak is often called the normal route (; ) in mountaineering.

==Debates==

===Naming of routes===

Traditionally, in many countries, the person who made the first ascent of a route was allowed to name it (in France, the naming rights go to whoever first bolted the route); this concept of &quot;naming ownership&quot; by the first ascensionist led to inertia with regard to the changing of problematic names including route names that were vulgar or had racial, sexual, colonial, discriminatory or other, slurs, tropes or stereotyping.

In 2020, the climbing community more directly confronted the issue of problematic names. In June 2020, climbing author Andrew Bisharat wrote in &quot;Rock &amp; Ice&quot; that &quot;routes belong to us all. That should include their names&quot; in regard to changing problematic names. At the same time, Duane Raleigh, the editor of &quot;Rock &amp; Ice&quot;, stepped down from his post recognizing some problematic names that he had given his own routes in the past. The debate intensified, reaching national media attention in countries around the world, and was described as climbing&#x27;s &quot;#MeToo&quot; moment.

In 2021, the American Alpine Club created the &quot;Climb United&quot; initiative to bring magazine editors, guidebook publishers and database managers, and other climbing community leaders together to create principles for naming routes that would &quot;Build the best publishing practices to avoid harm caused by discriminatory or oppressive route names&quot;. Many climbing guidebook publishers and route databases introduced policies to redact inappropriate route names, including the largest online databases, &quot;theCrag.com&quot;, and &quot;MountainProject.com&quot; (who had redacted 6,000 names in the first year).

===Manufactured or artificial routes===

Some climbers have physically altered the natural rock surface to &quot;construct&quot; a route (or make a route more climbable), by cutting or expanding handholds, which is also known as chipping. Such acts have at times caused controversy (e.g. Fred Rouhling&#x27;s &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Hugh&quot;), but at other times has not (e.g. &#x27;s famous Buoux route, &quot;La Rose et la Vampire&quot;). A 2022 survey by &quot;Climbing&quot; showed climbers were largely against manufacturing routes on natural outdoor rock on public lands, but were less negative on private lands (or on routes in quarries); they were willing to allow &quot;cleaning&quot; of routes (which some consider manufacturing), and also the repairing of routes (e.g. gluing back broken holds).

In contrast, indoor climbing is done on completely artificially manufactured sport climbing routes on climbing walls, as is competition climbing where a route setter manufactures a completely new route for each stage of the competition. In 2017, Black Diamond Equipment launched &quot;The Project&quot; on an indoor climbing wall in Sweden, with the aim of creating the world&#x27;s hardest sport climbing route at circa. ; it was later deconstructed having never been fully ascended, despite attempts by some of the world&#x27;s best climbers, including Adam Ondra, Stefano Ghisolfi, and Alex Megos. Since then, other &quot;Project-type&quot; routes have been created on other climbing walls, with the goal of being the world&#x27;s hardest route.

===Permanent-protection and retro-bolting of routes===
There has been a long-term debate in the climbing world on the use of permanently fixed in-situ climbing protection (e.g. such as bolts or pitons) on climbing routes. Such protection is not to provide aid (i.e. it is not aid-climbing per se), but to increase the safety of the route. Climbers call routes that have such protection, &quot;sport climbing routes&quot; (i.e. there is no risk, so it is purely a sport). In the 1980s and 1990s in the US, this debate became so heated that it was known as the &quot;bolt wars&quot;, with climbers bolt chopping (i.e. removing in-situ protection) on routes they considered to be traditional-only routes (i.e. no in-situ protection).

While all indoor climbing routes are bolted sport routes, the use of bolts in the outdoor natural environment raised environmental considerations, which led to the development of the clean climbing movement.

Other objections to pre-bolted protection highlighted the effect that such protection had on the very nature and challenge of a climbing route. In 1971, Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner wrote a famous essay called &quot;The Murder of the Impossible&quot; (which was believed to have been inspired by the 400-bolt &quot;Compressor Route&quot;), challenging that the use of such protection was diminishing the nature of mountaineering, saying of such climbers: &quot;he carries his courage in his rucksack, in the form of bolts and equipment&quot;. Such concerns also relate to the debate on retro-bolting of traditional climbing routes, which is the conversion into safer sport climbing routes, but that also fundamentally alters the nature of the route challenge.

==Notable routes==

===Rock climbing===
* Bouldering. Two of the most famous bouldering routes in history are &quot;Midnight Lightning&quot; in California, and &quot;Dreamtime&quot; in Switzerland. Other notable bouldering routes include &quot;&quot; in Italy, the world&#x27;s first-ever graded route, and &quot;Burden of Dreams&quot; in Finland, the world&#x27;s first-ever graded route.
* Sport climbing. Two of the most famous sport climbing routes in history are &quot;Action Directe&quot; in Germany, the world&#x27;s first-ever route, and &quot;Realization/Biographie&quot; in France, the world&#x27;s first consensus route. Other notable sport climbing routes include &quot;Jumbo Love&quot; in Nevada, the world&#x27;s first-ever sport route, and &quot;Silence&quot; in Norway, the world&#x27;s first-ever sport route.
* Traditional climbing. Traditional climbing was at the origin of free climbing, and many countries have their own notable traditional routes (e.g. &quot;Indian Face&quot; in Britain). Routes that set important milestones include &quot;Grand Illusion&quot; in Lake Tahoe, first , &quot;The Phoenix&quot; in Yosemite, first and the first-ever use of &quot;friends&quot;, and &quot;Super Crack&quot; in the Shawangunks, early consensus . Notable contemporary traditional climbing routes include &quot;Cobra Crack&quot; in Canada, &quot;Rhapsody&quot; in Britain, &quot;Blackbeard’s Tears&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot; in the US, and &quot;Tribe&quot; in Italy.
* Big wall climbing and aid climbing. Many of the most famous aid climbing routes were on big wall routes, which eventually became free climbing routes. The most famous route is &quot;The Nose&quot; whose aid ascent at 5.9 A2 was a major milestone in climbing, as was its eventual freeing at 5.14a. El Capitan has several other famous aid/big wall routes such as &quot;Salathé Wall&quot; (5.9 A2 aid, or 5.13b free) and the Salathé variant, &quot;Freerider&quot;, the most famous big wall free solo in history, and &quot;Dawn Wall&quot;, the first-ever 9a big wall route in history. Notable European routes are the north faces of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo in the Dolomites (e.g. &quot;&quot;), and on the southwest face of the Aiguille du Dru in France (e.g. &quot;Bonatti Pillar&quot;).

===Ice climbing===

* Ice climbing. Notable ice routes include the first to get near/above the WI6 grade milestone (i.e. sheer vertical sustained ice) such as &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot;, and &quot;Sea of Vapours&quot; in the Canadian Rockies, and &quot;Repentance Super&quot; in the Val di Cogne in Italy. Since 2010, Helmcken Falls in Canada has produced overhanging ice climbs above the WI10 grade, including &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; the world&#x27;s first-ever WI13 graded ice route.
* Mixed climbing. The most famous route is Jeff Lowe&#x27;s &quot;Octopussy&quot; WI6 M8 R, which started the mixed climbing revolution; this was followed by early consensus M10-12 routes in Europe and North America such as &quot;Reptile&quot; in Vail, Colorado, &quot;X-files&quot; and &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; in Val di Cogne, and &quot;Musashi&quot; in Canada. &quot;Iron Man&quot; in Switzerland became the world&#x27;s first consensus M14, and also the world&#x27;s first-ever FFFA of an M14.
* Dry tooling. Notable routes include &quot;Bichette Light&quot; in France, the world&#x27;s first-ever D14 (and with no mixed/ice component). The Tomorrow&#x27;s World Cave in the Dolomites in Italy produced the world&#x27;s first-ever consensus D15 (&quot;A Line Above the Sky&quot;), and consensus D16 (&quot;Parallel World&quot;) routes.

===Mountaineering===
* Alpine climbing. One of the most famous alpine climbing routes is the &quot;1938 Heckmair Route&quot; (ED2 V− A0 60 degrees), on the north face of the Eiger. The route is also one of the famous six alpine routes that first ascended the great north faces of the Alps. As alpine climbing spread outside of the Alps, famous alpine style routes were established on Himalayan peaks such as Latok I, The Ogre, Changabang, and Jannu.
* Expedition climbing. The most famous expedition climbing routes involve the eight-thousanders, which are the 14 mountains in the Himalayas and the Karakoram that are above in height above sea level. While reaching the summits of eight-thousanders by any route was once considered a major milestone, the development of even harder climbs on their faces and pillars has created several famous routes amongst climbers including the &quot;Rupal Face&quot; on Nanga Parbat and the &quot;Magic Line&quot; on K2&#x27;s southwest pillar; both of which have been tried by alpine climbers.

<text>The principle of equal consideration of interests is a moral principle that states that one should both include all affected interests when calculating the rightness of an action and weigh those interests equally. The term &quot;equal consideration of interests&quot; first appeared in Australian moral philosopher Peter Singer&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;. Singer asserts that if all beings, not just humans, are included as having interests that must be considered, then the principle of equal consideration of interests opposes not only racism and sexism, but also speciesism. Jeremy Bentham argued that a being&#x27;s capacity to suffer is what is morally relevant when considering their interests, not their capacity for reason.

The principle is related to broader philosophical concepts of impartiality, though impartiality can refer to many other senses of equality, particularly in justice.

<text>Mad Max is a 1979 Australian dystopian action film directed by George Miller in his directorial debut, who co-wrote the screenplay with James McCausland, based on a story by Miller and Byron Kennedy. Mel Gibson stars as &quot;Mad&quot; Max Rockatansky, a police officer turned vigilante in a dystopian near-future Australia in the midst of societal collapse. Joanne Samuel, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Steve Bisley, Tim Burns and Roger Ward also appear in supporting roles.

Principal photography for &quot;Mad Max&quot; took place in and around Melbourne and lasted for six weeks. The film initially received a polarized reception upon its release in April 1979, although it won four AACTA Awards. Filmed on a budget of A$400,000, it earned more than US$100 million worldwide in gross revenue and set a &quot;Guinness&quot; record for most profitable film. The success of &quot;Mad Max&quot; has been credited for further opening the global market to Australian New Wave films.

&quot;Mad Max&quot; became the first in the series, giving rise to three sequels: &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981), &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; (1985) and &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015). A spin-off film titled &quot;&quot; was released in 2024.

==Plot==

A dystopian near-future Australia is facing a breakdown of civil order primarily owing to widespread oil shortages and ecocide. The berserk motorbike gang member Crawford &quot;Nightrider&quot; Montazano kills a rookie officer of the poorly funded Main Force Patrol (MFP)—one of the last remaining law enforcement agencies—and escapes with his girlfriend in a Pursuit Special. Nightrider is able to elude the MFP until the organisation&#x27;s top pursuit man Max Rockatansky manages to steer him into a roadblock, resulting in a fiery crash that kills both Nightrider and his girlfriend.

At the MFP garage, Max is shown his new police car: a specially built V8-powered and supercharged black Pursuit Special. A conversation between Max&#x27;s superior Captain Fred &quot;Fifi&quot; Macaffee and Police commissioner Labatouche reveals the Pursuit Special was authorised to bribe Max, who is becoming weary of police work, into staying on the force. Nightrider&#x27;s motorbike gang, which is led by Toecutter and Bubba Zanetti, run riot in a town, vandalising property, stealing fuel and terrorising the populace. A young couple attempts to escape, but the gang destroys their car and assaults them. Max and fellow officer Jim &quot;Goose&quot; Rains arrest Toecutter&#x27;s young protégé Johnny the Boy at the scene. No witnesses appear in court and Johnny is deemed mentally unfit to stand trial. Against Goose&#x27;s furious objections, Johnny is released into Bubba&#x27;s custody.

While Goose visits a nightclub in the city that night, Johnny sabotages his police motorbike, causing it to lock up at high speed the next day and launch Goose off the road. Dazed but uninjured, Goose borrows a ute to haul his bike back to MFP headquarters. On the way, Johnny throws a brake drum through his windshield and Goose crashes again. Toecutter urges and forces a reluctant Johnny to throw a match into the wreck of the ute, burning Goose alive. After seeing Goose&#x27;s charred body in the hospital ICU, Max informs Fifi that he is resigning from the MFP to save what is left of his sanity. Fifi convinces him to take some time off before committing to his decision, so Max goes on a trip in his panel van with his wife Jessie and infant son &quot;Sprog&quot; (Australian slang for a child). When they stop to fix the spare tyre, Jessie takes Sprog to get ice cream and is accosted by Toecutter and his gang. She escapes and the family hides on a remote farm owned by an elderly friend, May Swaisey.

The gang continues pursuing Jessie through the woods, capturing Sprog while Max is out looking for them. May helps Jessie free the boy and the trio escapes in the station wagon, which then breaks down. Jessie grabs Sprog and runs down the road until the gang simply runs them over. Sprog is killed instantly, while a comatose Jessie is held in the ICU, in critical condition. Driven into a rage by the attack on his family, Max dons his police uniform and takes the black Pursuit Special, without authorisation, to pursue and eliminate the gang members. He kills several of them before being caught in a trap set by Toecutter, Bubba and Johnny; Bubba shoots Max in the leg and drives over his arm. Max is then able to shoot Bubba, in return, with a sawn-off shotgun. Toecutter and Johnny ride-off; Max staggers to his car and chases Toecutter, whom he forces into the path of an approaching semi-truck.

Finally, Max finds Johnny at the scene of a car wreck, stealing the boots of the deceased driver. He argues he is not to blame in the deaths of Max&#x27;s family, but Max handcuffs Johnny&#x27;s foot to the overturned vehicle and creates a crude time-delay fuse using leaking petroleum and Johnny&#x27;s own cigarette lighter. He gives Johnny a hacksaw, saying Johnny can either try to saw through the handcuffs (which will take ten minutes) or his ankle (which will take five minutes), if he wants to survive. As Max is driving away the vehicle detonates behind him.

===Development===
George Miller was a medical doctor in Sydney, working in a hospital emergency room where he saw many injuries and deaths of the types depicted in the film. He also witnessed many car accidents growing up in rural Queensland and lost at least three friends to accidents as a teenager.

While in residency at a Sydney hospital, Miller met amateur filmmaker Byron Kennedy at a summer film school in 1971. The two men produced a short film, &quot;Violence in the Cinema, Part 1&quot;, which was screened at a number of film festivals and won several awards. Eight years later, they produced &quot;Mad Max&quot;, working with first-time screenwriter James McCausland (who appears early in the film as the bearded man in an apron in front of the diner).

According to Miller, his interest while writing &quot;Mad Max&quot; was &quot;a silent movie with sound&quot;, employing highly kinetic images reminiscent of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd while the narrative itself was basic and simple. Miller believed that audiences would find his violent story more believable if set in a bleak dystopian future. He knew little about writing a script, but he had read Pauline Kael&#x27;s essay &quot;Raising Kane&quot; and concluded that most major American scriptwriters, like Herman Mankiewicz and Ben Hecht, were former journalists, so he hired McCausland, the Melbourne finance editor of &quot;The Australian&quot;, with whom he had previously bonded at a party as a fellow film buff. McCausland was paid roughly $3,500 for about a year&#x27;s worth of writing.

The basic concept for the film was already established when McCausland was brought on to the project. He worked from a one-page outline prepared by Miller, writing each evening from about 7 pm to midnight. Miller would then arrive at 6 am to confer. McCausland had never written a script before and did no formal or informal study in preparation, other than going repeatedly to the cinema with Miller and discussing the dramatic structure of westerns, road movies, and action films. McCausland described taking the lead in writing the dialogue, while Miller was concerned with giving his thoughts on the narrative context of each part and thinking through the visual beats of how things would unfold on screen. The ornate and hyper-verbal speech of Mad Max&#x27;s villains, like the manic Nightrider in the opening sequence, which would recur through the subsequent films in the franchise, in this sense stems from McCausland&#x27;s work, albeit under Miller&#x27;s instruction. McCausland drew heavily from his observations of the effects of the 1973 oil crisis on Australian motorists:

Kennedy and Miller first took the film to Graham Burke of Roadshow, who was enthusiastic. The producers felt they would be unable to raise money from the government bodies &quot;because Australian producers were making art films, and the corporations and commissions seemed to endorse them whole-heartedly&quot;, according to Kennedy. They designed a 40-page presentation, circulated it widely, and eventually raised the money. Kennedy and Miller also contributed funds themselves by doing three months of emergency medical calls, with Kennedy driving the car while Miller did the doctoring. Miller claimed the final budget was between $350,000 and $400,000. His brother Bill Miller was an associate producer on the film.

===Casting===
George Miller considered casting an American actor to &quot;get the film seen as widely as possible&quot; and even travelled to Los Angeles, but eventually opted to not do so as &quot;the whole budget would be taken up by a so-called American name.&quot; Instead, the cast deliberately featured lesser-known actors, so they did not carry past associations with them. Miller&#x27;s first choice for the role of Max was the Irish-born James Healey, who at the time worked at a Melbourne abattoir and was seeking a new acting job. Upon reading the script, Healey declined, finding the meager, terse dialogue unappealing.

Casting director Mitch Mathews invited a class of recent National Institute of Dramatic Art graduates to audition for &quot;Mad Max&quot;, specifically asking a NIDA teacher for &quot;spunky young guys&quot;. Among these actors was American-born Mel Gibson, whose audition impressed Miller and Matthews and earned him the role of Max. An apocryphal tale stated that Gibson went to auditions with a beat-up face following a fight, but this has been denied by both Matthews and Miller. Gibson&#x27;s friend and classmate Steve Bisley, who had worked with him in his only previous screen role, 1976&#x27;s &quot;Summer City&quot;, was cast as Max&#x27;s partner Jim Goose. A classmate of both, Judy Davis, has been said to have auditioned and been passed over, but Miller has declared she was only in Matthews&#x27; studio to accompany Gibson and Bisley.

Most of the biker gang extras were members of actual Australian motorcycle clubs and rode their own motorcycles in the film. They were even forced to ride the motorcycles from their residence in Sydney to the shooting locations in Melbourne because the budget did not allow for aerial transport. Three of the main cast members (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Roger Ward and Vincent Gil) had previously appeared in &quot;Stone&quot;, a 1974 film about biker gangs that is said to have inspired Miller.

===Vehicles===

Max&#x27;s yellow &quot;Interceptor&quot; was a 1974 Ford Falcon XB sedan (previously a Victoria police car) with a 351 c.i.d. Cleveland V8 engine.
The &quot;Big Bopper&quot;, driven by Roop and Charlie, was also a 1974 Ford Falcon XB sedan and a former Victoria police car, but was powered by a 302 c.i.d. V8. The &quot;March Hare&quot;, driven by Sarse and Scuttle, was an in-line-six-powered 1972 Ford Falcon XA sedan (this car was formerly a Melbourne taxi cab).

Max&#x27;s black &quot;Pursuit Special&quot; was a 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT351, a limited edition hardtop (sold in Australia from December 1973 to August 1976), which was primarily modified by Murray Smith, Peter Arcadipane, and Ray Beckerley. The main modifications were the Concorde front end, and the supercharger protruding through the bonnet (a nonfunctional cosmetic feature). The Concorde front was a fairly new accessory at the time, designed by Peter Arcadipane at Ford Australia as a showpiece, and later became available to the general public because of its popularity. After filming for &quot;Mad Max&quot; was completed, the car went up for sale, but no buyer was found, so it was given to Smith. He kept it until Miller wanted to use it for &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;, after which it again found no buyers and was left at a wrecking yard in Adelaide. It was bought and restored by Bob Forsenko, who later sold it to the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in Cumbria, England. When that museum closed, the car then went to a collection in the Dezer Museum in Miami, Florida.
The Nightrider&#x27;s vehicle, another Pursuit Special, was a 1972 Holden HQ Monaro coupe. It was also tuned, but was deliberately damaged to make it look like it had been involved in crashes.

The car driven by the young couple that is vandalised and then finally destroyed by the bikers is a 1959 Chevrolet Bel Air Sedan modified to look like a hot rod, with fake fuel injection stacks, fat tires, and a flame-red paint job.

Of the motorcycles that appear in the film, 14 were Kawasaki Kz1000 donated by a local Kawasaki dealer. All were modified in appearance by Melbourne business La Parisienne: one as the MFP bike ridden by Goose, and the balance for members of Toecutter&#x27;s gang, many of which were portrayed by members of a local Victorian motorcycle club, the Vigilantes.

The small blue van destroyed after being hit by The Big Bopper is a 1966 Mazda Bongo. It was the director&#x27;s personal vehicle but contrary to popular belief his van was not destroyed. For the stunt it is replaced by another Bongo, in poor condition and engineless, salvaged from a scrapyard and hastily repainted. Moreover, the paint cans on its roof are actually filled with milk, which would be easier to clean after filming.

By the end of filming, fourteen vehicles had been destroyed in the chase and crash scenes.

===Filming===

Originally, filming was scheduled to take ten weeks: six weeks of first unit, and four weeks on stunt and chase sequences. However, four days into shooting, Rosie Bailey, who was originally cast as Max&#x27;s wife, was injured in a bike accident. Production was halted, and Bailey was replaced by Joanne Samuel, causing a two-week delay. In the end, the shoot lasted six weeks in November and December 1977, with a further six weeks of second-unit work. The unit reconvened in May 1978 and spent another two weeks doing second-unit shots and re-staging some stunts.

Miller described the whole experience as &quot;guerrilla filmmaking&quot;, with the crew closing roads without filming permits and not using walkie-talkies because their frequency coincided with the police radio, and he and Kennedy would even sweep down the roads after filming was done. As filming progressed, however, the Victoria Police became interested in the production, and they began to help the crew by closing down roads and escorting vehicles. Because of the film&#x27;s limited budget, all but one of the police uniforms in the film were made of vinyl leather, with only one genuine leather uniform made for stunt sequences involving Bisley and Gibson.

Filming took place in and around Melbourne. Many of the car chase scenes were filmed near the town of Little River, northeast of Geelong. The early town scenes with Toecutter&#x27;s gang were filmed in the main street of Clunes, north of Ballarat; much of the streetscape remains unchanged. The bunker on which Roop was sitting, the site where Goose takes his ride, and the gate Big Bopper slides through are in Point Wilson.

At the beginning of production, the team faced a number of problems, and Miller was not sure that he would be able to finish the film. At one point, Miller quit and producing partner Byron Kennedy rang up Brian Trenchard-Smith and inquired if he would take over. Trenchard-Smith&#x27;s advice was to hire instead a quality first assistant director to support George. After a couple of days, Miller rallied and completed the film, but the crew had little respect for him during the shoot.

Safety control was supervised by Ian Goddard, an internationally known motorcycle racer. Goddard and his four assistants, aided by an extensive radio communications network, were so diligent in their work that not a single accident occurred during filming.

&quot;Mad Max&quot; was one of the first Australian films to be shot with a widescreen anamorphic lens, although Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;The Cars That Ate Paris&quot; (1974) was shot in anamorphic four years earlier. Miller&#x27;s desire to shoot in anamorphic made him seek out a set of Todd-AO wide-angle lenses that Sam Peckinpah had discarded in Australia after they became damaged while filming &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972). The only lens that worked properly was a 35mm lens, which Miller employed to shoot the whole of &quot;Mad Max&quot;.

===Post-production===
The film&#x27;s post-production was done at a friend&#x27;s apartment in North Melbourne, with Miller and Kennedy editing the film in the small lounge room on a home-built editing machine that Kennedy&#x27;s father, an engineer, had designed for them. Miller and Kennedy also performed sound editing there. Tony Patterson spent four months editing the film, then had to leave because he was contracted to work on &quot;Dimboola&quot; (1979). George Miller took over editing with Cliff Hayes, and they worked for an additional three months. Kennedy and Miller did the final cut, in a process Miller described as &quot;he would cut sound in the lounge room and I&#x27;d cut picture in the kitchen.&quot;

Professional sound engineer Roger Savage performed the sound mixing in a studio after finishing his work for Little River Band. He employed timecoding techniques that were previously unseen in Australian cinema.

===Music===

The musical score for &quot;Mad Max&quot; was composed and conducted by Australian composer Brian May (not to be confused with the guitarist of the English rock band Queen). Miller wanted a Gothic, Bernard Herrmann–type score and hired May after hearing his work for &quot;Patrick&quot; (1978). May said: &quot;With the little budget that we had we went ahead and did it, and spent a lot of time on it. George was marvelous to work with; he had a lot of ideas about what he wanted although he wasn&#x27;t a musician.&quot;

A soundtrack album was released in 1980 by Varèse Sarabande.

==Release==
&quot;Mad Max&quot; was first released in Australia through Roadshow Film Distributors (now Village Roadshow Pictures) in 1979. It was sold overseas for $1.8 million—American International Pictures (AIP) acquired the distribution rights for the United States (it would be one of the last films released by AIP before the company was folded into Filmways), while Warner Bros. handled the rest of the world. The film was banned in New Zealand and Sweden, in the former because the scene in which Goose is burned alive inside his vehicle unintentionally mirrored an incident with a real gang shortly before the film&#x27;s release. In 1983, after the success of the sequel, &quot;Mad Max&quot; was shown in New Zealand with an R18 certificate. The ban in Sweden was removed in 2005, and the film has since been shown on television and sold on home media there.

When &quot;Mad Max&quot; was released in the United States in 1980, the original Australian dialogue was redubbed by American voice actors, and much of the Australian slang and terminology was replaced (examples: &quot;Oi!&quot; became &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;See looks!&quot; became &quot;See what I see?&quot;, &quot;windscreen&quot; became &quot;windshield&quot;, &quot;very toey&quot; became &quot;super hot&quot;, and &quot;proby&quot;—probationary officer—became &quot;rookie&quot;). AIP also altered the operator&#x27;s duty call on Jim Goose&#x27;s bike in the beginning of the film (it ended with &quot;Come on, Goose, where are you?&quot;). The only exceptions to the dubbing were the singer in the Sugartown Cabaret (played by Robina Chaffey), Charlie (played by John Ley) when he speaks through the mechanical voice box, and Goose (Steve Bisley) when he sings while driving the truck before being ambushed. Since Mel Gibson was not well known to American audiences at the time, trailers and television spots in the United States emphasised the film&#x27;s action content. The original Australian dialogue track was finally released in North America in 2000 in a limited theatrical reissue by MGM (now an Amazon subsidiary) (the film&#x27;s current rights holders), and the film has since been released in the U.S. on DVD with the American and Australian soundtracks included on separate audio tracks.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD on 1 January 2002 and re-released on DVD on 15 September 2015. It was released on Blu-ray on 5 October 2010 and re-released on Blu-ray on 15 September 2015 by 20th Century Fox. Kino Lorber (on behalf of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, under license to MGM Home Entertainment) released the film on 4K Blu-ray Disc on 24 November 2020. On 16 November 2021, it was reissued in 4K along with the three other films in the series as part of the &quot;Mad Max Anthology&quot; 4K set from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (via Studio Distribution Services).

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Mad Max&quot; grossed A$5,355,490 at the box office in Australia and over US$100 million worldwide. Given its small production budget, it was the most profitable film ever made at the time and held the Guinness World Record for the highest box-office-to-budget ratio of any motion picture until the release of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999).

===Critical response===
Upon its release, the film polarized critics. In a 1979 review, the Australian social commentator and film producer Phillip Adams condemned &quot;Mad Max&quot;, suggesting it would promote violence, saying that it had &quot;all the emotional uplift of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and would be &quot;a special favourite of rapists, sadists, child murderers and incipient Mansons&quot;. After its United States release, Tom Buckley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;ugly and incoherent&quot;, and Stephen King, writing in &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, called it a &quot;turkey&quot;. However, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine praised the directorial debut by Miller.

The film was awarded three Australian Film Institute Awards in 1979 (for editing, musical score, and sound), and was given a special award for stunt work; it was also nominated for Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Keays-Byrne). At the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival, the film won the Special Jury Award.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 90% approval rating based on 71 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10; the site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus&quot; reads: &quot;Staging the improbable car stunts and crashes to perfection, director George Miller succeeds completely in bringing the violent, post-apocalyptic world of &quot;Mad Max&quot; to visceral life.&quot; The film has been included in &quot;best 1,000 films of all time&quot; lists from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

<text>Herodias (; , &quot;Hērōidiás&quot;; c. 15 BC – after AD 39) was a princess of the Herodian dynasty of Judaea during the time of the Roman Empire. Christian writings connect her with the execution of John the Baptist.

The daughter of Aristobulus IV and his wife Berenice, Herodias
was a full sister to Herod V (king of Chalkis), Herod Agrippa (king of Judea), Aristobulus Minor, and Mariamne III (wife of Crown Prince Antipater). Following Antipater&#x27;s execution by Herod the Great, she was possibly the first wife of Herod Archelaus, principal heir of Herod the Great and ethnarch of Judea.

==Marriages==


===Herod II===
Herod the Great executed his sons Alexander and Aristobulus IV in 7 BC, and engaged Herodias to Herod II (born ca. 27 BC; died AD 33), her half-uncle. The marriage was opposed by Antipater II, Herod the Great&#x27;s eldest son. Antipater&#x27;s execution in 4 BC for plotting to poison his father left Herod II as first in line. However, when Herod the Great discovered that his wife Mariamne knew about the poison plot but did not try to stop it, he divorced her and dropped her son Herod II from the line of succession, just days before he died.

Both the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Mark state that Herodias was married to Philip, therefore some scholars have argued his name was &quot;Herod Philip&quot; (&quot;not to be confused with Philip the Tetrarch, whom some writers call Herod Philip II&quot;, Josephus account says Herodias married Herod, the grandson of Simon Boethus and that Salome married Phillip. This Herod was only named Herod in the text).

Many scholars dispute this, however, and believe it was an error, a theory supported by the fact that the Gospel of Luke drops the name Philip. Because he was the grandson of the high priest Simon Boethus he is sometimes described as Herod Boethus, but there is no evidence he was called by that name. 

There was one daughter from this marriage, Salome. Herodias later divorced Herod II, although it is unclear when they were divorced. According to the historian Josephus:Herodias took upon her to confound the laws of our country, and divorced herself from her husband while he was alive, and was married to Herod Antipas

===Herod Antipas===
Herodias&#x27; second husband was Herod Antipas (born before 20 BC; died after 39 AD) half-brother of Herod II (her first husband). He is best known today for his role in events that led to the executions of John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth.

Antipas divorced his first wife Phasaelis, the daughter of King Aretas IV of Nabatea, in favor of Herodias. According to biblical scholars, the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, it was this proposed marriage which John the Baptist publicly criticized. Aside from provoking his conflict with the Baptist, the tetrarch&#x27;s divorce added a personal grievance to previous disputes with Aretas over territory on the border of Perea and Nabatea. Aretas sent an army to punish Antipas, and was joined in this endeavor by auxiliary troops from the province of Syria. Josephus calls these troops &#x27;fugitives&#x27;, while Moses of Chorene says they were the army of King Abgarus V of Edessa, under the command of commander Khosran Ardzrouni.

The result of this war proved disastrous for Antipas; a Roman counter-offensive was ordered by Tiberius, but abandoned upon that emperor&#x27;s death in 37 AD. In 39 AD Antipas was accused by his nephew/brother-in-law Agrippa I of conspiracy against the new Roman emperor Caligula, who sent him into exile in Gaul. Accompanied there by Herodias, he died at an unknown date. It is uncertain if Herodias had any children by her second husband, Herod Antipas.

==In the Gospels==
In the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, Herodias plays a major role in the execution of John the Baptist, using her daughter&#x27;s dance before Antipas and his party guests to ask for the head of the Baptist as a reward. According to the Gospel of Mark, Antipas did not want to put John the Baptist to death, for Antipas liked to listen to John the Baptist preach (Mark 6:20). Furthermore, Antipas may have feared that if John the Baptist were to be put to death, his followers would riot. The Gospel of Luke amplifies the role of Herod by omitting these details.

=== Modern scholarship ===
Some biblical scholars have questioned whether the Gospels give historically accurate accounts of John the Baptist&#x27;s execution. Some exegetes believe that Antipas&#x27; struggle with John the Baptist as told in the Gospels was some kind of a remembrance of the political and religious fight opposing the Israelite monarchs Ahab and Jezebel to the prophet Elijah.

==In medieval Europe==
In medieval Europe, Herodias, or just her name, became associated with beliefs about witches, in particular their supernatural leader they would join at night to ride with or visit in a &quot;play&quot; or other gathering. Thus she became synonymous with figures who performed the same function, such as Diana, Holda, and Abundia.

==In art and fiction==
Together with Salome, Herodias was a frequent subject in depictions of the Power of Women topos in the later Medieval and Renaissance periods.
