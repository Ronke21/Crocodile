<text>Mauna Kea (, ; abbreviation for &quot;Mauna a Wākea&quot;) is a dormant shield volcano on the island of Hawaii. Its peak is above sea level, making it the highest point in Hawaii and the island with the second highest high point, behind New Guinea, the world&#x27;s largest tropical island with multiple peaks that are higher. The peak is about higher than Mauna Loa, its more massive neighbor. Mauna Kea is unusually topographically prominent for its height: its prominence from sea level is fifteenth in the world among mountains, at ; its prominence from under the ocean is , rivaled only by Mount Everest. This dry prominence is greater than Everest&#x27;s height above sea level of , and some authorities have labeled Mauna Kea the tallest mountain in the world, from its underwater base. Mauna Kea is ranked 8th by topographic isolation.

It is about one million years old and thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago. In its current post-shield state, its lava is more viscous, resulting in a steeper profile. Late volcanism has also given it a much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes due to construction of cinder cones, decentralization of its rift zones, glaciation on its peak, and weathering by the prevailing trade winds. Mauna Kea last erupted 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and is now thought to be dormant.

In Hawaiian religion, the peaks of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only high-ranking aliʻi to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living on the slopes of Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep, and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the volcano&#x27;s ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a &quot;Sophora chrysophylla&quot;–&quot;Myoporum sandwicense&quot; (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks, and an &quot;Acacia koa&quot;–&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot; (or koa–ōhia) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources to work towards eradicating all feral species on the volcano.

With its high elevation, dry environment, and stable airflow, Mauna Kea&#x27;s summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation. Since the creation of an access road in 1964, thirteen telescopes funded by eleven countries have been constructed at the summit. The Mauna Kea Observatories are used for scientific research across the electromagnetic spectrum and comprise the largest such facility in the world. Their construction on a landscape considered sacred by Native Hawaiians continues to be a topic of debate to this day.

==Topographic prominence==
Mauna Kea is unusually topographically prominent for its height, with a wet prominence fifteenth in the world among mountains, and a dry prominence second in the world, after only Mount Everest. It is the highest peak on its island, so its wet prominence matches its height above sea level, at . Because the Hawaiian Islands slope deep into the ocean, Mauna Kea has a dry prominence of . This dry prominence is taller than Mount Everest&#x27;s height above sea level of , so Everest would have to include whole continents in its foothills to exceed Mauna Kea&#x27;s dry prominence.

Given how much Mauna Kea protrudes from the Hawaiian Trough, some authorities have called it the tallest (as opposed to highest) mountain in the world, as measured from base to peak. Unlike prominence, base is loosely defined, which has resulted in numbers ranging from (roughly to the deepest point in the Hawaiian Trough) to (to the root of the mountain deep underground). Those calculations have produced rivaling claims for other mountains, such as higher climb from base for Mount Lamlam (, starting from nearby Challenger Deep), and the tremendously deep roots of the Himalayan Mountains. Greater rises could be measured from the Atacama Trench to the Andes Mountains, for example, the bottom of Richard&#x27;s Deep ( deep) to the peak of the nearby Llullaillaco ( high) is . Neither Mount Lamlam nor Llullaillaco have the dry prominence of Mauna Kea, because they do not extend into trenches in every direction.

==Geology==
Mauna Kea is one of five volcanoes that form the island of Hawaii, the largest and youngest island of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Of these five hotspot volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago. Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000 years ago, and is currently active, having last erupted between 4,500 and 6,000 years ago. Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit. A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.

Mauna Kea is over in volume, so massive that it and its neighbor, Mauna Loa, depress the ocean crust beneath it by .

The volcano continues to slip and flatten under its own weight at a rate of less than per year. Much of its mass lies east of its present summit. It stands above sea level, about higher than its neighbor Mauna Loa, and is the highest point in the state of Hawaii.

Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea has been created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth&#x27;s underlying mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian Ridge–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet&#x27;s mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect.

Lava flows from Mauna Kea overlapped in complex layers with those of its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once believed to be a part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.

The shield-stage lavas that built the enormous main mass of the volcano are tholeiitic basalts, like those of Mauna Loa, created through the mixing of primary magma and subducted oceanic crust. They are covered by the oldest exposed rock strata on Mauna Kea, the post-shield alkali basalts of the &quot;Hāmākua Volcanics&quot;, which erupted between 250,000 and 70–65,000 years ago. The most recent volcanic flows are hawaiites and mugearites: they are the post-shield &quot;Laupāhoehoe Volcanics&quot;, erupted between 65,000 and 4,000 years ago. These changes in lava composition accompanied the slow reduction of the supply of magma to the summit, which led to weaker eruptions that then gave way to isolated episodes associated with volcanic dormancy. The Laupāhoehoe lavas are more viscous and contain more volatiles than the earlier tholeiitic basalts; their thicker flows significantly steepened Mauna Kea&#x27;s flanks. In addition, explosive eruptions have built cinder cones near the summit. These cones are the most recent eruptive centers of Mauna Kea. Its present summit is dominated by lava domes and cinder cones up to in diameter and hundreds of meters tall.
Mauna Kea is the only Hawaiian volcano with distinct evidence of glaciation. Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa, but have been covered by later lava flows. Despite Hawaii&#x27;s tropical location, during several past ice ages a drop of a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the volcano&#x27;s summit through summer, triggering the formation of an ice cap. There are three episodes of glaciation that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years: the &quot;Pōhakuloa&quot; (180–130 ka), &quot;Wāihu&quot; (80–60 ka) and &quot;Mākanaka&quot; (40–13 ka) series. These have extensively sculpted the summit, depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the volcano&#x27;s upper flanks. Subglacial eruptions built cinder cones during the Mākanaka glaciation, most of which were heavily gouged by glacial action. The most recent cones were built between 9,000 and 4,500 years ago, atop the glacial deposits, although one study indicates that the last eruption may have been around 3,600 years ago.

At their maximum extent, the glaciers extended from the summit down to between of elevation. A small body of permafrost, less than across, was found at the summit of Mauna Kea before 1974, and may still be present. Small gullies etch the summit, formed by rain- and snow-fed streams that flow only during winter melt and rain showers.
On the windward side of the volcano, stream erosion driven by trade winds has accelerated erosion in a manner similar to that on older Kohala.

Mauna Kea is home to Lake Waiau, the highest lake in the Pacific Basin. At an altitude of , it lies within the Puu Waiau cinder cone and is the only alpine lake in Hawaii. The lake is very small and shallow, with a surface area of and a depth of when fullest. Radiocarbon dating of samples at the base of the lake indicates that it was clear of ice 12,600 years ago. Hawaiian lava types are typically permeable, preventing lake formation due to infiltration. Either sulfur-bearing steam altered the volcanic ash to low-permeability clays, or explosive interactions between rising magma and groundwater or surface water during phreatic eruptions formed exceptionally fine ash that reduced the permeability of the lake bed.

No artesian water was known on the island of Hawaii until 1993 when drilling by the University of Hawaii tapped an artesian aquifer more than below sea level, that extended more than of the borehole&#x27;s total depth. The borehole had drilled through a compacted layer of soil and lava where the flows of Mauna Loa had encroached upon the exposed Mauna Kea surface and had subsequently been subsided below sea level. Isotopic composition shows the water present to have been derived from rain coming off Mauna Kea at higher than above mean sea level. The aquifer&#x27;s presence is attributed to a freshwater head within Mauna Kea&#x27;s basal lens. Scientists believe there may be more water in Mauna Kea&#x27;s freshwater lens than current models may indicate. Two more boreholes were drilled on Mauna Kea in 2012, with water being found at much higher elevations and shallower depths than expected. Donald Thomas, director of the University of Hawaii&#x27;s Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes believes one reason to continue study of the aquifers is due to use and occupancy of the higher elevation areas, stating: &quot;Nearly all of these activities depend on the availability of potable water that, in most cases, must be trucked to the Saddle from Waimea or Hilo — an inefficient and expensive process that consumes a substantial quantity of our scarce liquid fuels.&quot;

===Future activity===
The last eruption of Mauna Kea was about 4,600 years ago (about 2600 BC); because of this inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which is given to the extinct volcano Kohala). Since 8000 BC lava flows have covered 20% of the volcano&#x27;s summit and virtually none of its flanks.

Despite its dormancy, Mauna Kea is expected to erupt again. Based on earlier eruptions, such an event could occur anywhere on the volcano&#x27;s upper flanks and would likely produce long lava flows, mostly of aā, long. Long periods of activity could build a cinder cone at the source. Although not likely in the next few centuries, such an eruption would probably result in little loss of life but significant damage to infrastructure.
==Human history==

===Native history===
The first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful. Settlement expanded inland to the Mauna Loa – Mauna Kea region in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations. The mountain&#x27;s plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.

Early settlement of the Hawaiian islands led to major changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species. Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals, and their arrival was associated with increased rates of erosion.
The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the prevailing cause of forest ecosystem collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian (or Pacific) rat.

The five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains; and Mauna Kea&#x27;s summit, the highest, is the most sacred. For this reason, a &quot;kapu&quot; (ancient Hawaiian law) restricted visitor rights to high-ranking aliʻi. Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In Hawaiian mythology, the summit of Mauna Kea was seen as the &quot;region of the gods&quot;, a place where benevolent spirits reside. Poliahu, deity of snow, also resides there. &quot;Mauna Kea&quot; is an abbreviation for Mauna a Wākea and means &quot;white mountain,&quot; in reference to its seasonally snow-capped summit.

Around AD 1100, natives established adze quarries high up on Mauna Kea to extract the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD 1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.

Lake Waiau provided drinking water for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, to give them the strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.

This early era was followed by cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for the immediate needs of the populace. These &quot;ahupuaa&quot; generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. Mauna Kea&#x27;s summit was encompassed in the ahupuaa of Kaohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humuula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the māmane–naio forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the uau (&quot;Pterodroma sandwichensis&quot;), nēnē (&quot;Branta sandvicensis&quot;), and palila (&quot;Loxioides bailleui&quot;). The lower koa–ōhia forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.

===Modern era===

There are three accounts of foreigners visiting Hawaii before the arrival of James Cook, in 1778. However, the earliest Western depictions of the isle, including Mauna Kea, were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Contact with Europe and America had major consequences for island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools.

In 1793, cattle were brought by George Vancouver as a tribute to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped confinement and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended Kamehameha I, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the lower native forest for sugarcane plantations and houses.

The Saddle Road, named for its crossing of the saddle-shaped plateau between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, was completed in 1943, and eased travel to Mauna Kea considerably.

The Pohakuloa Training Area on the plateau is the largest military training ground in Hawaii. The base extends from the volcano&#x27;s lower flanks to elevation, on state land leased to the US Army since 1956. There are 15 threatened and endangered plants, three endangered birds, and one endangered bat species in the area.

Mauna Kea has been the site of extensive archaeological research since the 1980s. Approximately 27 percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000, identifying 76 shrines, 4 adze manufacturing workshops, 3 other markers, 1 positively identified burial site, and 4 possible burial sites. By 2009, the total number of identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano&#x27;s upper flanks is ongoing. It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano&#x27;s summit along what may be an ancient snow line, are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea. Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial.

===Ascents===
In pre-contact times, natives traveling up Mauna Kea were probably guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as no evidence of trails has been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea&#x27;s slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives reached the summit, because of the strict &quot;kapu&quot; placed on it.

In the early 19th century, the earliest notable &quot;recorded&quot; ascents of Mauna Kea included the following:
*On August 26, 1823, Joseph F. Goodrich, an American missionary, made the first recorded ascent in a single day; however, a small arrangement of stones he observed suggested he was not the first human on the summit. He recorded four ecosystems as he travelled from base to summit, and also visited Lake Waiau.
*On June 17, 1825, an expedition from HMS &quot;Blonde&quot;, led by botanist James Macrae, reached the summit of Mauna Kea. Macrae was the first person to record the Mauna Kea silversword (&quot;Argyroxiphium sandwicense&quot;), saying: &quot;The last mile was destitute of vegetation except one plant of the Sygenisia tribe, in growth much like a Yucca, with sharp pointed silver coloured leaves and green upright spike of three or four feet producing pendulous branches with brown flowers, truly superb, and almost worth the journey of coming here to see it on purpose.&quot;
*In January 1834, David Douglas climbed the mountain and described extensively the division of plant species by altitude. On an unrelated traverse, from Kamuela to Hilo in July, he was found dead in a pit intended to catch wild cattle. Although murder was suspected, it was probably an accidental fall. The site, &quot;Ka lua kauka&quot; , is marked by the Douglas fir trees named for him.
*In 1881, Queen Emma traveled to the peak to bathe in the waters of Lake Waiau during competition for the role of ruling chief of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
*On August 6, 1889, E.D. Baldwin left Hilo and followed cattle trails to the summit.
*In February 2021, Victor Vescovo and Clifford Kapono made the first ascent of Mauna Kea from its subaerial base 16,785 ft below sea level using the submersible &quot;Limiting Factor&quot;, then ocean kayaks from above the mountain base 27 miles to the shoreline, then bicycles to a camp at about 9000 ft altitude from which they then walked to the 13,802 ft summit (a total gain of 30,587 ft).

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the movement of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, vehicular access to the summit was practically impossible until the construction of a road in 1964, and it continues to be restricted. Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.

==Ecology==
===Background===
Hawaii&#x27;s geographical isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a large number of species that are found nowhere else (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands). The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these endemic species from external biotic influence, and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects of invasive species. In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island&#x27;s endemic species have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation. These ecosystems can be roughly divided into three sections by elevation: alpine–subalpine, montane, and basal forest.

Contact with Americans and Europeans in the early 19th century brought more settlers to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea&#x27;s native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.

===Alpine environment===
The summit of Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and consists of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and is known as the Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low water retention capacity.

Plant species found at this elevation include &quot;Styphelia tameiameiae&quot;, &quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot;, &quot;Tetramolopium humile&quot;, &quot;Agrostis sandwicensis&quot;, &quot;Anthoxanthum odoratum&quot;, &quot;Trisetum glomeratum&quot;, &quot;Poa annua&quot;, &quot;Sonchus oleraceus&quot;, and &quot;Coprosma ernodiodes&quot;. One notable species is Mauna Kea silversword (&quot;Argyroxiphium sandwicense&quot; var. &quot;sandwicense&quot;), a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea&#x27;s high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage reduced to a population of just 50 plants, Mauna Kea silversword was thought to be restricted to the alpine zone, but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well.

The Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve on the southern summit flank of Mauna Kea was established in 1981. The reserve is a region of sparsely vegetated cinder deposits and lava rock, including areas of aeolian desert and Lake Waiau. This ecosystem is a likely haven for the threatened uau (&quot;Pterodroma sandwichensis&quot;) and also the center of a study on wēkiu bugs (&quot;Nysius wekiuicola&quot;).

Wēkiu bugs feed on dead insect carcasses that drift up Mauna Kea on the wind and settle on snow banks. This is a highly unusual food source for a species in the genus &quot;Nysius&quot;, which consists of predominantly seed-eating insects. They can survive at extreme elevations of up to because of natural antifreeze in their blood. They also stay under heated surfaces most of the time. Their conservation status is unclear, but the species is no longer a candidate for the Endangered Species List; studies on the welfare of the species began in 1980. The closely related &quot;Nysius aa&quot; lives on Mauna Loa. Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and forest tent caterpillar moths have also been observed in the same Mauna Kea ecosystem; the former survive by hiding under heat-absorbing rocks, and the latter through cold-resistant chemicals in their bodies. Several native moths are also present near the summit including &quot;Agrotis helela&quot; and &quot;Agrotis kuamauna&quot;. 

===Māmane–naio forest===
The forested zone on the volcano, at an elevation of , is dominated by māmane (&quot;Sophora chrysophylla&quot;) and naio (&quot;Myoporum sandwicense&quot;), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest. Māmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the palila (&quot;Loxioides bailleui&quot;). The palila was formerly found on the slopes of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Hualālai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea—only 10% of its former range—and has been declared critically endangered.

The largest threat to the ecosystem is grazing by feral sheep, cattle (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;), and goats (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed as far back as the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.

Mouflon (&quot;Ovis aries orientalis&quot;) was introduced from 1962 to 1964, and a plan to release axis deer (&quot;Axis axis&quot;) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who said that they would damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea&#x27;s ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case &quot;Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources&quot; (1978).

The court ruled in favor of conservationists and upheld the precedence of federal laws before state control of wildlife. Having violated the Endangered Species Act, Hawaii state was required to remove all feral animals from the mountainside. This decision was followed by a second court order in 1981. A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals, at least temporarily. An active control program is in place, though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the māmane-naio ecosystem. There are many other species and ecosystems on the island, and on Mauna Kea, that remain threatened by human development and invasive species.

The Mauna Kea Forest Reserve protects of māmane-naio forest under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. Ungulate hunting is allowed year-round. A small part of the māmane–naio forest is encompassed by the Mauna Kea State Recreation Area.

===Lower environment===
A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea&#x27;s lower slopes was formerly &quot;Acacia koa&quot; – &quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot; (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction was driven by an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and those parts of the forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900, logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.

The Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge is a major koa forest reserve on Mauna Kea&#x27;s windward slope. It was established in 1985, covering of ecosystem remnant. Eight endangered bird species, twelve endangered plants, and the endangered Hawaiian hoary bat (&quot;Lasiurus cinereus semotus&quot;) have been observed in the area, in addition to many other rare biota. The reserve has been the site of an extensive replanting campaign since 1989. Parts of the reserve show the effect of agriculture on the native ecosystem, as much of the land in the upper part of the reserve is abandoned farmland.

Bird species native to the acacia koa–ōhia forest include the Hawaiian crow (&quot;Corvus hawaiiensis&quot;), the akepa (&quot;Loxops coccineus&quot;), Hawaii creeper (&quot;Oreomystis mana&quot;), ʻakiapōlāʻau (&quot;Hemignathus munroi&quot;), and Hawaiian hawk (&quot;Buteo solitarius&quot;), all of which are endangered, threatened, or near threatened; the Hawaiian crow in particular is extinct in the wild, but there are plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau reserve.

==Summit observatories==

Mauna Kea&#x27;s summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world&#x27;s best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea&#x27;s distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.

In the early 1960s, the Hawaii Island Chamber of Commerce encouraged astronomical development of Mauna Kea, as economic stimulus; this coincided with University of Arizona astronomer Gerard Kuiper&#x27;s search for sites to use newly improved detectors of infrared light. Site testing by Kuiper&#x27;s assistant Alika Herring in 1964 confirmed the summit&#x27;s outstanding suitability. An intense three-way competition for NASA funds to construct a large telescope began between Kuiper, Harvard University, and the University of Hawaii (UH), which only had experience in solar astronomy. This culminated in funds being awarded to the &quot;upstart&quot; UH proposal. UH rebuilt its small astronomy department into a new Institute for Astronomy, and in 1968 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources gave it a 65-year lease for all land within a radius of its telescope, essentially that above . On its completion in 1970, the UH was the seventh largest optical/infrared telescope in the world.
By 1970, two telescopes had been constructed by the US Air Force and Lowell Observatory. In 1973, Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6 m CFHT on Mauna Kea. However, local organisations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory. This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan, drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980. In January 1982, the UH Board of Regents approved a plan to support the continued development of scientific facilities at the site. In 1998, were transferred from the observatory lease to supplement the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve. The 1982 plan was replaced in 2000 by an extension designed to serve until 2020: it instituted an Office of Mauna Kea Management, designated for astronomy, and shifted the remaining to &quot;natural and cultural preservation&quot;. This plan was further revised to address concern expressed in the Hawaiian community that a lack of respect was being shown toward the cultural values of the mountain.

Today the Mauna Kea Science Reserve has 13 observation facilities, each funded by as many as 11 countries. There are nine telescopes working in the visible and infrared spectrum, three in the submillimeter spectrum, and one in the radio spectrum, with mirrors or dishes ranging from . In comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope has a mirror, similar in size to the UH88, now the second smallest telescope on the mountain.

A &quot;Save Mauna Kea&quot; movement believes development of the mountain to be sacrilegious. Native Hawaiian non-profit groups such as Kahea, concerned with cultural heritage and the environment, also oppose development for cultural and religious reasons. The multi-telescope &quot;outrigger&quot; proposed in 2006 was eventually canceled. A planned new telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), has attracted controversy and protests. The TMT was approved in April 2013. In October 2014, the groundbreaking ceremony for the telescope was interrupted by protesters causing the project to temporarily halt. In late March 2015, demonstrators blocked access of the road to the summit again. On April 2, 2015, 300 protestors were gathered near the visitor center when 12 people were arrested with 11 more arrested at the summit. Among the concerns of the protest groups are the land appraisals and Native Hawaiians consultation. Construction was halted on April 7, 2015, after protests expanded over the state. After several halts, the project has been voluntarily postponed. Governor Ige announced substantial changes to the management of Mauna Kea in the future but stated the project can move forward. The Supreme Court of Hawaii approved the resumption of construction on October 31, 2018. Protestors have posted online petitions as a reaction against the Thirty Meter Telescope. The online petition titled &quot;The Immediate Halt to the Construction of the TMT Telescope&quot; was posted to Change.org on July 14, 2019. The online petition has currently gathered over 278,057 signatures worldwide. Some protesters have also called for the impeachment of Hawaiian Governor David Ige because of his support for the Thirty Meter Telescope. On July 18, 2019, an online petition titled &quot;Impeach Governor David Ige&quot; had been posted to Change.org and has currently gathered over 62,562 signatures.

As of late 2021, construction plans are currently on hold due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift in funding for the project that may see federal funds made available through the National Science Foundation. The controversy surrounding construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope continues. Independent polls commissioned by local media organizations show consistent support for the project in the islands with over two thirds of local residents supporting the project. These same polls indicate Native Hawaiian community support remains split with about half of Hawaiian respondents supporting construction of the new telescope.

A July 2022 state law responds to the protests by shifting control over the master land lease from the University of Hawaii to the new Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority (MKSOA). The MKSOA is a 12-member board (11 voting members and 1 non-voting member) which includes representatives from the university, astronomers and native Hawaiians and it was created with the aim of finding a balance between the conflicting interests of astronomers and native Hawaiians. It is placed within the Hawaii department of land and natural resources and will be the principal authority for the management of state-managed lands within the Mauna Kea lands after a 5-year transition period from the university starting on July 1, 2023. During the transition period, the MKSOA and the university will jointly manage the land while the authority develops a management plan to govern land uses, human activities, and overall operations. Once the transition period is up in 2028, the authority&#x27;s responsibilities will include issuing new land use permits which will be important as the current master lease ends in 2033, and any observatories which don&#x27;t come up with new leases by the time of its expiration will be decommissioned.

==Climate==

Mauna Kea has an alpine climate (ET). Due to the influence of its tropical latitude, temperature swings are very low. Frosts are common year round, but the average monthly temperature remains above freezing throughout the year.

Snow may fall at an altitude of and above in any month, but occurs most often from October to April.

A weather station was operated from 1972 to 1982; however, only 33 months within this period have temperature records; many years only have data for two months. The temperatures presented below are smoothed averages, not the raw numbers recorded by NOAA.
==Recreation==

Mauna Kea&#x27;s coastline is dominated by the Hamakua Coast, an area of rugged terrain created by frequent slumps and landslides on the volcano&#x27;s flank. The area includes several recreation parks including Kalopa State Recreation Area, Wailuku River State Park and Akaka Falls State Park.

There are over 3,000 registered hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, is a common activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail. The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport. Birdwatching is also common at lower levels on the mountain. A popular site is &quot;Kīpuka Puu Huluhulu&quot;, a kīpuka on Mauna Kea&#x27;s flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill.
Mauna Kea&#x27;s great height and the steepness of its flanks provide a better view and a shorter hike than the adjacent Mauna Loa. The height with its risk of altitude sickness, weather concerns, steep road grade, and overall inaccessibility make the volcano dangerous and summit trips difficult. Until the construction of roads in the mid-20th century, only the hardy visited Mauna Kea&#x27;s upper slopes; hunters tracked game animals, and hikers traveled up the mountain. These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s as base camps, and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level Onizuka Center for International Astronomy telescope support complex is derived. The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964, making the peak accessible to more people.

Today, multiple hiking trails exist, including the Mauna Kea Trail, and by 2007 over 100,000 tourists and 32,000 vehicles were going each year to the Visitor Information Station (VIS) adjacent to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy. The Mauna Kea Access Road is paved up to the Center at . One study reported that around a third of visitors and two-thirds of professional astronomers working on the mountain have experienced symptoms of acute altitude sickness. Visitors to the mountain should prepare ahead of time by acclimating at a lower elevation or using a prescription medicine like Diamox. It is strongly recommended to use a four-wheel drive vehicle to drive all the way to the top. Brakes often overheat on the way down and there is no fuel available on Mauna Kea. A free Star Gazing Program was previously held at the VIS every night from 6-10 pm, with the program canceled due to both a change in operating hours and closure due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Between 5,000 and 6,000 people visit the summit of Mauna Kea each year, and to help ensure safety, and protect the integrity of the mountain, a ranger program was implemented in 2001.

<text>An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae in the order Crocodilia. The two extant species are the American alligator (&quot;A. mississippiensis&quot;) and the Chinese alligator (&quot;A. sinensis&quot;). Additionally, several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains. Alligators first appeared during the late Eocene epoch about 37 million years ago.

The term &quot;alligator&quot; is likely an anglicized form of &quot;&quot;, Spanish for &quot;the lizard&quot;, which early Spanish explorers and settlers in Florida called the alligator. Early English spellings of the name included &quot;allagarta&quot; and &quot;alagarto&quot;.

==Evolution==
Alligators and caimans split in North America during the early Tertiary or late Cretaceous (about 53 million to 65 million years ago). The Chinese alligator split from the American alligator about 33 million years ago and probably descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator&#x27;s full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s. The full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.

==Phylogeny==
The genus &quot;Alligator&quot; belongs to the subfamily Alligatorinae, which is the sister taxon to Caimaninae (the caimans). Together, these two subfamilies form the family Alligatoridae. The cladogram below shows the phylogeny of alligators.

== Description ==

An average adult American alligator&#x27;s weight and length is and , but they sometimes grow to long and weigh over . The largest ever recorded, found in Louisiana, measured . The Chinese alligator is smaller, rarely exceeding in length. Additionally, it weighs considerably less, with males rarely over .

Adult alligators are black or dark olive-brown with white undersides, while juveniles have bright yellow or whitish stripes which sharply contrast against their dark hides, providing them additional camouflage amongst reeds and wetland grasses.

Alligators commonly live up to 50 years, but there have been examples of alligators living over 70. One of the oldest recorded alligator lives was that of Saturn, an American alligator who was hatched in 1936 in Mississippi and spent nearly a decade in Germany before spending the majority of his life at the Moscow Zoo, where he died at the age of 83 or 84 on 22 May 2020. Another one of the oldest lives on record is that of Muja, an American alligator who was brought as an adult specimen to the Belgrade Zoo in Serbia from Germany in 1937. Although no valid records exist about his date of birth, as of 2012, he was in his 80s and possibly the oldest alligator living in captivity.

== Habitat ==

Alligators are native only to the United States and China.

American alligators are found in the southeast United States: all of Florida and Louisiana; the southern parts of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi; coastal South and North Carolina; East Texas, the southeast corner of Oklahoma, and the southern tip of Arkansas. Louisiana has the largest alligator population. The majority of American alligators inhabit Florida and Louisiana, with over a million alligators in each state. Southern Florida is the only place where both alligators and crocodiles live side by side. 

American alligators live in freshwater environments, such as ponds, marshes, wetlands, rivers, lakes, and swamps, as well as in brackish water. When they construct alligator holes in the wetlands, they increase plant diversity and provide habitat for other animals during droughts. They are, therefore, considered an important species for maintaining ecological diversity in wetlands. Farther west, in Louisiana, heavy grazing by nutrias and muskrats is causing severe damage to coastal wetlands. Large alligators feed extensively on nutrias, and provide a vital ecological service by reducing nutria numbers.

The Chinese alligator currently is found in only the Yangtze River valley and parts of adjacent provinces and is extremely endangered, with only a few dozen believed to be left in the wild. Far more Chinese alligators live in zoos around the world than can be found in the wild. Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in southern Louisiana has several in captivity in an attempt to preserve the species. Miami MetroZoo in Florida also has a breeding pair of Chinese alligators.

== Behavior ==

Large male alligators are territorial animals. Smaller alligators can often be found in large numbers close to each other. The largest of the species (both males and females) defend prime territory; smaller alligators have a higher tolerance for other alligators within a similar size class.

Alligators move on land by two forms of locomotion, referred to as &quot;sprawl&quot; and &quot;high walk&quot;. The sprawl is a forward movement with the belly making contact with the ground and is used to transition to &quot;high walk&quot; or to slither over wet substrate into water. The high walk is an up-on-four-limbs forward motion used for overland travel with the belly well up from the ground. Alligators have also been observed to rise up and balance on their hind legs and semi-step forward as part of a forward or upward lunge. However, they can not walk on their hind legs.

Although the alligator has a heavy body and a slow metabolism, it is capable of short bursts of speed, especially in very short lunges. Alligators&#x27; main prey are smaller animals they can kill and eat with a single bite. They may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown. Alligators consume food that cannot be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot or by biting and then performing a &quot;death roll&quot;, spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-sized chunks are torn off. Critical to the alligator&#x27;s ability to initiate a death roll, the tail must flex to a significant angle relative to its body. An alligator with an immobilized tail cannot perform a death roll.

Most of the muscle in an alligator&#x27;s jaw evolved to bite and grip prey. The muscles that close the jaws are powerful, but the muscles for opening their jaws are weak. As a result, an adult human can hold an alligator&#x27;s jaws shut bare-handed. It is common to use several wraps of duct tape to prevent an adult alligator from opening its jaws when being handled or transported.

Alligators are generally timid towards humans and tend to walk or swim away if one approaches. This may encourage people to approach alligators and their nests, which can provoke the animals into attacking. In Florida, feeding wild alligators at any time is illegal. If fed, the alligators will eventually lose their fear of humans and will learn to associate humans with food.

== Diet ==

The type of food eaten by alligators depends upon their age and size. When they are young, alligators eat fish, insects, snails, crustaceans, and worms. As they mature, progressively larger prey is taken, including larger fish, such as gar, turtles, and various mammals, particularly nutrias and muskrats, as well as birds, deer, and other reptiles. Their stomachs also often contain gizzard stones. They will even consume carrion if they are sufficiently hungry. In some cases, larger alligators are known to ambush dogs, Florida panthers, and black bears, making them the apex predator throughout their distribution. In this role as a top predator, it may determine the abundance of prey species, including turtles and nutrias. As humans encroach into their habitat, attacks are few but not unknown. Alligators, unlike the large crocodiles, do not immediately regard a human upon encounter as prey, but may still attack in self-defense if provoked.

==Reproduction==
Alligators generally mature at a length of . The mating season is in late spring. In April and May, alligators form so-called &quot;bellowing choruses&quot;. Large groups of animals bellow together for a few minutes a few times a day, usually one to three hours after sunrise. The bellows of male American alligators are accompanied by powerful blasts of infrasound. Another form of male display is a loud head-slap. In 2010, on spring nights alligators were found to gather in large numbers for group courtship, the so-called &quot;alligator dances&quot;.

In summer, the female builds a nest of vegetation where the decomposition of the vegetation provides the heat needed to incubate the eggs. The sex of the offspring is determined by the temperature in the nest and is fixed within seven to 21 days of the start of incubation. Incubation temperatures of or lower produce a clutch of females; those of or higher produce entirely males. Nests constructed on leaves are hotter than those constructed on wet marsh, so the former tend to produce males and the latter, females. The baby alligator&#x27;s egg tooth helps it get out of its egg during hatching time. The natural sex ratio at hatching is five females to one male. Females hatched from eggs incubated at weigh significantly more than males hatched from eggs incubated at . The mother defends the nest from predators and assists the hatchlings to water. She will provide protection to the young for about a year if they remain in the area. Adult alligators regularly cannibalize younger individuals, though estimates of the rate of cannibalism vary widely. In the past, immediately following the outlawing of alligator hunting, populations rebounded quickly due to the suppressed number of adults preying upon juveniles, increasing survival among the young alligators.

== Anatomy ==

Alligators, much like birds, have been shown to exhibit unidirectional movement of air through their lungs. Most other amniotes are believed to exhibit bidirectional, or tidal breathing. For a tidal breathing animal, such as a mammal, air flows into and out of the lungs through branching bronchi which terminate in small dead-end chambers called alveoli. As the alveoli represent dead-ends to flow, the inspired air must move back out the same way it came in. In contrast, air in alligator lungs makes a circuit, moving in only one direction through the parabronchi. The air first enters the outer branch, moves through the parabronchi, and exits the lung through the inner branch. Oxygen exchange takes place in extensive vasculature around the parabronchi.

The alligator has a similar digestive system to that of the crocodile, with minor differences in morphology and enzyme activity. Alligators have a two-part stomach, with the first smaller portion containing gastroliths. It is believed this portion of the stomach serves a similar function as it does in the gizzard of some species of birds, to aid in digestion. The gastroliths work to grind up the meal as alligators will take large bites or swallow smaller prey whole. This process makes digestion and nutrient absorption easier once the food reaches the second portion of the stomach. Once an alligator&#x27;s meal has been processed it will move on to the second portion of the stomach which is highly acidic. The acidity of the stomach has been observed to increase once digestion begins. This is due to the increase in CO2 concentration of the blood, resulting from the right to left shunting of the alligators heart. The right to left shunt of the heart in alligators means the circulatory system will recirculate blood through the body instead of back to the lungs. The re-circulation of blood leads to higher CO2 concentration as well as lower oxygen affinity. There is evidence to suggest that there is increased blood flow diverted to the stomach during digestion to facilitate an increase in CO2 concentration which aids in increasing gastric acid secretions during digestion. The alligator&#x27;s metabolism will also increase after a meal by up to four times its basal metabolic rate. Alligators also have highly folded mucosa in the lining of the intestines to further aid in the absorption of nutrients. The folds result in greater surface area for the nutrients to be absorbed through.

Alligators also have complex microbiomes that are not fully understood yet, but can be attributed to both benefits and costs to the animal. These microorganisms can be found in the high surface area of the mucosa folds of the intestines, as well as throughout the digestive tract. Benefits include better total health and stronger immune system. However alligators are still vulnerable to microbial infections despite the immune boost from other microbiota.

During brumation the process of digestion experiences changes due to the fasting most alligators experience during these periods of inactivity. Alligators that go long enough without a meal during brumation will begin a process called autophagy, where the animal begins to consume its fat reserves to maintain its body weight until it can acquire a sufficient meal. There is also fluctuation in the level of bacterial taxa populations in the alligator&#x27;s microbial community between seasons which helps the alligator cope with different rates of feeding and activity.

Like other crocodilians, alligators have an armor of bony scutes. The dermal bones are highly vascularised and aid in calcium balance, both to neutralize acids while the animal cannot breathe underwater and to provide calcium for eggshell formation.

Alligators have muscular, flat tails that propel them while swimming.

The two kinds of white alligators are albino and leucistic. These alligators are practically impossible to find in the wild. They could survive only in captivity and are few in number. The Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans has leucistic alligators found in a Louisiana swamp in 1987.

==Human uses==
Alligators are raised commercially for their meat and their skin, which when tanned is used for the manufacture of luggage, handbags, shoes, belts, and other leather items. Alligators also provide economic benefits through the ecotourism industry. Visitors may take swamp tours, in which alligators are a feature. Their most important economic benefit to humans may be the control of nutrias and muskrats.

Alligator meat is also consumed by humans.

== Differences from crocodiles ==
While there are rules of thumb for distinguishing alligators from crocodiles, all of them admit exceptions. Such general rules include:

*&quot;Exposed vs. interdigitated teeth&quot;: The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, leaving only the upper teeth visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves on the outside of the top jaw, making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed, thus creating a &quot;toothy grin&quot;.
*&quot;Shape of the nose and jaw&quot;: Alligators have wider, shovel-like, U-shaped snouts, while crocodile snouts are typically more pointed or V-shaped. The alligators&#x27; broader snouts have been contentiously thought to allow their jaws to withstand the stress of cracking open the shells of turtles and other hard-shelled animals that are widespread in their environments. A 2012 study found very little correlation between bite force and snout shape amongst 23 tested crocodilian species.
* &quot;Functioning salt glands&quot;: Crocodilians have modified salivary glands called salt glands on their tongues, but while these organs still excrete salt in crocodiles and gharials, those in most alligators and caimans have lost this ability, or excrete it in only extremely small quantities. The ability to excrete excess salt allows crocodiles to better tolerate life in saline water and migrating through it. Because alligators and caimans have lost this ability, they are largely restricted to freshwater habitats, although larger alligators do sometimes live in tidal mangroves and in very rare cases in coastal areas.
* &quot;Integumentary sense organs&quot;: Both crocodiles and alligators have small, pit-like sensory organs called integumentary sense organs (ISOs) or dermal pressure receptors (DPRs) surrounding their upper and lower jaws. These organs allow crocodilians to detect minor pressure changes in surrounding water, and assist them in locating and capturing prey. In crocodiles, however, such organs extend over nearly the entire body. Crocodile ISOs may also assist in detection of local salinity, or serve other chemosensory functions.
* &quot;Less consistent differences&quot;: Crocodiles are generally thought of as more aggressive than alligators. Only six of the 23 crocodilian species are considered dangerous to adult human beings, most notably the Nile crocodile and saltwater crocodile. Each year, hundreds of deadly attacks are attributed to the Nile crocodile in sub-Saharan Africa. The American crocodile is considered to be less aggressive. Only a few (unverified) cases of American crocodiles fatally attacking humans have been reported.

<text>The Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) are a group of independent astronomical research facilities and large telescope observatories that are located at the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaiʻi, United States. The facilities are located in a 525-acre (212 ha) special land use zone known as the &quot;Astronomy Precinct&quot;, which is located within the 11,228-acre (4,544 ha) Mauna Kea Science Reserve. The Astronomy Precinct was established in 1967 and is located on land protected by the Historical Preservation Act for its significance to Hawaiian culture. The presence and continued construction of telescopes is highly controversial due to Mauna Kea&#x27;s centrality in native Hawaiian religion and culture, as well as for a variety of environmental reasons.

The location is near ideal because of its dark skies from lack of light pollution, good astronomical seeing, low humidity, high elevation of , position above most of the water vapor in the atmosphere, clean air, good weather and low latitude location.

==Origin and background==
Significantly predating the current observatories there is evidence of active astronomy on Mauna Kea in the 1901 Land Office Map of the Island of Hawaii showing the &quot;Hawaii Astronomy Station&quot; near the Mauna Kea summit.

After studying photos for NASA&#x27;s Apollo program that contained greater detail than any ground-based telescope, Gerard Kuiper began seeking an arid site for infrared studies. While he first began looking in Chile, he also made the decision to perform tests in the Hawaiian Islands. Tests on Maui&#x27;s Haleakalā were promising, but the mountain was too low in the inversion layer and often covered by clouds. On the &quot;Big Island&quot; of Hawaiʻi, Mauna Kea is considered the second-highest island mountain in the world. While the summit is often covered with snow, the air is extremely dry. Kuiper began looking into the possibility of an observatory on Mauna Kea. After testing, he discovered the low humidity was perfect for infrared signals. He persuaded Hawaiʻi Governor John A. Burns to bulldoze a dirt road to the summit where he built a small telescope on Puu Poliahu, a cinder cone peak. The peak was the second highest on the mountain with the highest peak being holy ground, so Kuiper avoided it. Next, Kuiper tried enlisting NASA to fund a larger facility with a large telescope, housing and other needed structures. NASA, in turn, decided to make the project open to competition. Professor of physics, John Jefferies of the University of Hawaii placed a bid on behalf of the university. Jefferies had gained his reputation through observations at Sacramento Peak Observatory. The proposal was for a two-meter telescope to serve both the needs of NASA and the university. While large telescopes are not ordinarily awarded to universities without well-established astronomers, Jefferies and UH were awarded the NASA contract, infuriating Kuiper, who felt that &quot;his mountain&quot; had been &quot;stolen&quot; from &quot;him&quot;. Kuiper would abandon his site (the very first telescope on Mauna Kea) over the competition and begin work in Arizona on a different NASA project. After considerable testing by Jefferies&#x27; team, the best locations were determined to be near the summit at the top of the cinder cones. Testing also determined Mauna Kea to be superb for nighttime viewing due to many factors, including the thin air, constant trade winds and being surrounded by sea. Jefferies would build a 2.24 meter telescope with the State of Hawaiʻi agreeing to build a reliable, all weather roadway to the summit. Building began in 1967 and first light was seen in 1970.

Other groups began requesting subleases on the newly accessible mountaintop. By 1970, two telescopes had been constructed by the United States Air Force and Lowell Observatory. In 1973, Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6 m CFHT on Mauna Kea. However, local organizations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory. This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan, drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980. In January 1982, the University of Hawaiʻi Board of Regents approved a plan to support the continued development of scientific facilities at the site. In 1998, were transferred from the observatory lease to supplement the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve. The 1982 plan was replaced in 2000 by an extension designed to serve until 2020: it instituted an Office of Mauna Kea Management, designated for astronomy, and shifted the remaining to &quot;natural and cultural preservation&quot;. This plan was further revised to address concern expressed in the Hawaiian community that a lack of respect was being shown toward the cultural value the mountain embodied to the region&#x27;s indigenous people.

, the Mauna Kea Science Reserve has 13 observation facilities, each funded by as many as 11 countries. It is one of the world&#x27;s premier observatories for optical, infrared, and submillimeter astronomy, and in 2009 was the largest measured by light gathering power. There are nine telescopes working in the visible and infrared spectrum, three in the submillimeter spectrum, and one in the radio spectrum, with mirrors or dishes ranging from . In comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope has a mirror, similar in size to the UH88, now the second smallest telescope on the mountain.

===Controversies===
Planned new telescopes, including the Thirty Meter Telescope, have attracted controversy due to their potential cultural and ecological impact. The multi-telescope &quot;outrigger&quot; extension to the Keck telescopes, which required new sites, was eventually canceled. Three or four of the mountain&#x27;s 13 existing telescopes must be dismantled over the next decade with the TMT proposal to be the last area on Mauna Kea on which any telescope would ever be built.

With all the controversy, the building of telescopes has led to the creation of the Hawaii Night Sky Protection Act. As artificial light forms a light cloud above the land, the excess light disrupts the clear pictures taken by the telescopes. On July 1, 2013, the Hawaii Night Sky Protection Act was initiated, affecting both the Big Island and Maui. A large difference between the Hawaiian islands and the mainland United States can be observed: street lighting. Almost all streets are dark as the lamps have either not been built, have been removed, or have been dimmed.

===Scientific discoveries===
The Mauna Kea Observatories involves thirteen large telescopes. In November 2020, in collaboration with Europe&#x27;s low-frequency ARray radio telescope, Mauna Kea&#x27;s Gemini observatory and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (NITF), discovered the first Super-Planet. 
In October, 2011, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt, and Adam G. Riess; the prize recognized their findings, based on research on supernovae at the observatories, that dark energy is a force causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.

==Management==
The Reserve was established in 1968, and is leased by the State of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). The University of Hawaiʻi manages the site and leases land to several multi-national facilities, which have invested more than $2 billion in science and technology. The lease expires in 2033 and after that 40 of 45 square kilometers (25 of 28 square miles) revert to the state of Hawaii.
Currently, pressure has been placed on the University based management. House Bill 2024 pushes for new stewardship on the summit. The area will be integrated in terms of management. Some land will be jurisdicted by the local community. The Bill pushes for future laws and regulations in terms of new building. As always, the cultural and environmental sites will be heavily recognized as a factor for consideration.

==Location==

The altitude and isolation in the middle of the Pacific Ocean makes Mauna Kea one of the best locations on Earth for ground-based astronomy. It is an ideal location for submillimeter, infrared and optical observations. The seeing statistics show that Mauna Kea is the best site in terms of optical and infrared image quality; for example, the CFHT site has a median seeing of 0.43 arcseconds.

Accommodations for research astronomers are located at the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy (often called Hale Pōhaku), by unpaved steep road from the summit at above sea level.

An adjacent visitor information station is located at . The summit of Mauna Kea is so high that tourists are advised to stop at the visitor station for at least 30 minutes to acclimate to atmospheric conditions before continuing to the summit, and scientists often stay at Hale Pōhaku for eight hours or more before spending a full night at observatories on the summit, with some telescopes requiring observers to spend one full night at Hale Pōhaku before working at the summit.

==Telescopes==

Telescopes found at the summit of Mauna Kea are funded by government agencies of various nations. The University of Hawaiʻi directly administers two telescopes. In total, there are twelve facilities housing thirteen telescopes at or around the summit of Mauna Kea.

==Opposition and protests==

In Honolulu, the governor and legislature, enthusiastic about the development, set aside an even larger area for the observatory after the initial project, causing opposition on the Big Island, in the city of Hilo. Native Hawaiians (kānaka ʻōiwi) believed the entire site was sacred and that developing the mountain, even for science, would spoil the area. Environmentalists were concerned about rare native bird populations and other citizens of Hilo were concerned about the sight of the domes from the city. Using town hall meetings, Jefferies was able to overcome opposition by weighing the economic advantage and prestige the island would receive. There has been substantial opposition to the Mauna Kea observatories that continues to grow. Over the years, the opposition to the observatories may have become the most visible example of the conflict science has encountered over access and use of environmental and culturally significant sites. Opposition to development grew shortly after expansion of the observatories commenced. Once access was opened up by the roadway to the summit, skiers began using it for recreation and objected when the road was closed as a precaution against vandalism when the telescopes were being built. Hunters voiced concerns, as did the Hawaiian Audubon Society who were supported by Governor George Ariyoshi.

The Audubon Society objected to further development on Mauna Kea over concerns to habitat of the endangered Palila, a species endemic to only specific parts of this mountain. The bird is the last of the finch billed honeycreepers existing on the island. Over 50% of native bird species had been killed off due to loss of habitat from early western settlers or the introduction of non-native species competing for resources. Hunters and sportsmen were concerned that the hunting of feral animals would be affected by the telescope operations. A &quot;Save Mauna Kea&quot; movement was inspired by the proliferation of telescopes, with opposition believing development of the mountain to be sacrilegious. Native Hawaiian non-profit groups, such as Kahea, whose goals are the protection of cultural heritage and the environment, oppose development on Mauna Kea as a sacred space to the Hawaiian religion. The land is protected by the United States Historical Preservation Act due to its significance to Hawaiian culture, but still allowed development.

==2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake==
A number of the telescopes sustained minor damage during the October 15, 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake and aftershocks. JCMT was performing an inclinometry run and recorded the earthquake on its tilt sensors. Both CFHT and W. M. Keck Observatory were operational and back online by October 19.

<text>Head Start is a program of the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provides comprehensive early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and families. It is the oldest and largest program of its kind. The program&#x27;s services and resources are designed to foster stable family relationships, enhance children&#x27;s physical and emotional well-being, and establish an environment to develop strong cognitive skills. The transition from preschool to elementary school imposes diverse developmental challenges that include requiring the children to engage successfully with their peers outside the family network, adjust to the space of a classroom, and meet the expectations the school setting provides.

Launched in 1965 by its creator and first director Jule Sugarman and Bernice H. Fleiss, Head Start was originally conceived as a catch-up summer school program that would teach low-income children in a few weeks what they needed to know to start elementary school. The Head Start Act of 1981 expanded the program. The program was revised and reauthorized in December 2007. , more than 22 million children had participated. The current acting director of Head Start is Tala Hooban.
==History==
Head Start began as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society campaign. Its justification came from the staff of the President&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers. Stan Salett, civil rights organizer, national education policy adviser, and creator of the Upward Bound Program, is also credited with initiating the Head Start program.

Johnson started the War on Poverty shortly after President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. The murder shook the nation, and Johnson attempted to gain public trust by passing legacy legislation during the subsequent months. Johnson received an initial briefing from Walter Heller, who informed Johnson of Kennedy&#x27;s poverty program. By March 1964, the legislation, now known as the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, had been prepared for Congress. The legislation included training, educational, and service programs for communities, including the Job Corps.

The Office of Economic Opportunity&#x27;s Community Action Program launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965. The program was led by Dr. Robert Cooke, a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins University, and Dr. Edward Zigler, a professor of psychology and director of the Yale Child Study Center. They designed a comprehensive child development program intended to help communities meet the needs of disadvantaged preschool children. Rather than proceeding with a smaller pilot program, the decision was made to roll it out on a large scale with the enrollment of 500,000 children in 2,500 communities. The following year it was authorized by Congress as a year–round program. In 1968, Head Start began funding a television series that would eventually be called &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, operated by the Carnegie Corporation Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW).

In 1969, Head Start was transferred to the Office of Child Development in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (later the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)) by the Nixon Administration. Today the program is in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) division of DHHS.

In 1994, the Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to age three, in an effort to capitalize on research evidence that showed that the first three years are critical to children&#x27;s long-term development.

In the early years, some 700,000 children enrolled at a per-capita cost of $2,000 to $3,000 (2011 dollars). Under the full-time program, enrollment dropped to under 400,000 by the early 1970s. Enrollment reached close to 1 million children by 2011. The program has experienced underfunding and under-enrollment in recent years. In 2023, there were about 820,000 children enrolled in the program.

== Policy Council ==

The Head Start Policy Council makes up part of the Head Start governing body. Policy Council must be composed of two types of representatives: parents of currently enrolled children and community representatives. At least 51% of the members of this group must be the parents of currently enrolled children (see 45 CFR 1306.3(h) for a definition of a Head Start Parent). All parent members of the Policy Council stand for election or re-election annually through individual parent groups. Grantees/Delegates are required to provide proportionate representation to parents in all program options and settings. If agencies operate programs serving different geographical regions or ethnic groups, they must ensure that all groups being served will have an equal opportunity to serve on the Policy Council. The Policy Council is required to meet once each month. The term follows the federal government fiscal year, running November–November. Service on the Policy Council board is limited to at most five one year terms. The meetings are conducted in accordance with Robert&#x27;s Rules. The meeting day and time is agreed upon during the first meeting of the term year and may be adjusted as needed.

The Policy Council approval is needed for several program functions, from new hires to the program, as well as for the budget and spending. The Council can serve the program in ways that the others in the program cannot, as it is the only body that is part of Head Start that can do fundraising. In addition to monthly meetings, Policy Council may at times need to hold special or emergency meetings or have a phone vote. Policy Council representatives are required to attend classroom meetings and report back to the Policy Council with issues and needs of the classroom. They may also be asked to sit in on interviews as Head Start requires that a Policy Council representative be present for all interviews. The officers of Policy Council include vice-chairperson, secretary, and vice-secretary. Classrooms are also able to elect alternate Policy Council reps in case the main rep is unable to attend the meetings.

== Services and programs ==
Head Start serves over 1 million children and their families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. Related health services include health screenings and check-ups, eye examinations and dental check-ups. Meals and snacks are also provided, which can help ease financial pressure on families and improve children&#x27;s diets. Family advocates assist parents in accessing community resources. All services are specific to each family&#x27;s culture and experience. Head Start programs also seek to support children&#x27;s social emotional development.

Programs and services include:
* Early Head Start promotes healthy prenatal outcomes, healthy families, as well as infant and toddler development beginning as early as birth.
* Head Start helps to create healthy development and early childhood education in low-income children ages three to five.
* Family and Community Partnerships engage and support parents to identify and meet their own goals, nurture their children, and advocate for communities that support children and families.
* Migrant and Seasonal services are for children of migrant and seasonal farm workers. Service hours are longer and programs extend for fewer months than traditional Head Start.
* Head Start serves indigenous Americans with centers on reservations and in urban communities.
* Homeless children were included explicitly as subjects with the 2007 re-authorization. Programs must identify and provide services to homeless children of all ages within a reasonable period. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 2001 also requires access to early childhood education such as Head Start for homeless children and families.

== Eligibility ==
Eligibility is largely income-based, although each local program includes other eligibility criteria, such as disabilities and services needed by other family members. Families must earn less than 100% of the federal poverty level. Programs may accept up to 10% of the total children over poverty given the program has unfilled spots and the over poverty is less than 130%. 

The federal poverty line measure is not absolute, and it changes yearly to account for inflation. Families may also qualify under a categorical eligibility category—receipt of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) funds, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security funds, or Homeless, as per the McKinney-Vento Act. Up to 10% of any funded program&#x27;s enrollment can be from higher income families or families experiencing emergency situations. All programs are required to provide services to children with disabilities, who must comprise 10% of their total enrollment. Per the Head Start Act (2007), programs may elect to serve families whose income is between 100-130% under certain circumstances. Programs must also complete additional reporting requirements if this is appropriate for their community.

Military families stationed abroad can apply for Sure Start. Sure Start is the military version of Head Start and is overseen by the Department of Defense Education Activity. There are four priority tiers for Sure Start, and like Head Start, not all eligible families are guaranteed a spot. The tiers are based on the sponsor&#x27;s rank and are, in order, E1-E4, E5, E6-E7, and E8-E9.

== Budget and funding ==
The 2011 federal budget for Head Start was $8.1 billion. 85% was to be devoted to direct services and no more than 15% on administration, serving approximately one million students. The budget was $12 billion in 2023.

Local grantees must provide a 20% cash/in-kind match. Each local grantee is required to obtain an annual financial audit, if it receives more than $500,000 in federal support.

Grants are awarded by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Regional Offices and the American Indian – Alaska Native and Migrant and Seasonal Program Branches directly to local public agencies, private organizations, Indian tribes and school systems.

The individual Head Start classrooms/centers &quot;repay&quot; the grant through a program known as InKind. The Inkind program is a way to get their parents and their students working together on out of class studies.

== Teachers ==
All lead teachers must have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or be working towards one. Most have completed six or more courses in early-childhood education. By 2013, all teachers were to have associate degrees in a related field and half must have bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

As of 2003, the average Head Start teacher made $21,000 per year, compared to the public school teacher average of $43,000.

Teachers are also required to complete a (CDA) Child Development Associate certificate.

== Operations ==
While Head Start is a national program, the implementation is up to individual states. Head Start programs typically operate independently from local school districts. Most often they are administered through local social-services agencies. Classes are generally small, with fewer than ten enrollees per adult staff member. Individual programs develop their own academic and social curricula, following federal performance standards.

== Impact ==

A 2020 study found that cohorts that attended Head Start had higher incomes and years of education as adults than similar children who did not attend. A 2021 study found that the children exposed to more generous Head Start funding had substantially improved test scores relative to children that were not exposed to generous Head Start funding. Another 2021 study found that students enrolled in Head Start ended up having substantially higher high school completion, college enrollment and college completion rates than comparable children who were not enrolled in Head Start. The authors of the study concluded, &quot;these estimates imply sizable, long-term returns to investments in means-tested, public preschool programs.&quot; A 2009 study, which compared siblings, found that those who attended Head Start showed stronger academic performance as shown on test scores for years afterward, were less likely to be diagnosed as learning-disabled, less likely to commit crime, more likely to graduate from high school and attend college, and less likely to suffer from poor health as an adult. This study was replicated in a 2020 study which looked at 10 additional birth cohorts, and found a negligible impact.

A 2022 study found that Head Start increased the employment and earnings of single mothers. 

In 2015, CCR Analytics, formerly Child Care Analytics, published the results of their Family Outcomes Survey completed by nearly 11,600 California Head Start and Early Head Start parents. 90% of parents surveyed said that Head Start helped them to get or keep a job. 92% of parents surveyed said that Head Start helped them to enroll in an educational or training program. 99% of families surveyed said that Head Start helped them to improve their parenting skills, such as responding to children&#x27;s misbehavior and helping their children to learn. These results indicate that Head Start has a positive impact on the whole family, beyond the individual children who attend the program.

In 2014, CCR Analytics published the results of their study of 49,467 children assessed in the 2012–2013 school year from 81 Head Start programs throughout the state of California (more than 50% of the entire California Head Start population). Participation in the study was open to all California Head Start programs who used the DRDP-PS 2010 assessment tool. The study found that providing two years of Head Start to a child increases the probability by between 13% and 86% that the child will meet age appropriate expectations. Regression discontinuity design was used to measure program impact without denying a control group the opportunity to attend Head Start. The analysis compared three-year-olds enrolled in Head Start to four-year-olds who returned to Head Start for their second year. This also eliminated the issue of selection bias because both groups chose to attend Head Start as three-year-olds.

A randomized control study of the pre-k program serving socioeconomically disadvantaged children in Tennessee found short-term gains in language, literacy and math outcomes for pre-k participants compared with children who did not participate, which was also confirmed by a discontinuity analysis (Lip, Farran, Bilbrey, Hofer, &amp; Dong, 2011).

Lee collected data across sixty Head Start classrooms in 2007 and 2008. A sample of 1,260 children ages three to four were selected as the final sample. Of these children, 446 had entered Head Start at age 3 and enrolled for a year (Group 1); 498 had been entered at age 4 and enrolled for a year (Group 2); and 316 children had been enrolled for 2 years, entering at age 3 (Group 3). Academic outcome measures in literacy, math and science were collected based on the Head Start and Early Childhood Program Observational Checklist rating on a 4-point scale (1—not yet to 4—excels. Family risk factor indicators (developed by the State Department of Education) included single parent, unemployed parent, teenage parent, parental loss (divorce/death), low parental school achievement, food insufficiency. Group 3 had higher literacy, math and science scores than the other groups. Children in the high-risk group had significantly lower literacy, math, and science scores than those who had three or fewer risk factors. Head Start is associated with significant gains in test scores. Head Start significantly reduces the probability that a child will repeat a grade.

In 2002, Garces, Thomas and Currie used data from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics to review outcomes for close to 4,000 participating adults followed from childhood and compared with non-participant siblings. Among European Americans, adults who had attended Head Start were significantly more likely to complete high school, attend college and possibly have higher earnings in their early twenties. African-American adults who had attended Head Start were significantly less likely to be booked/charged for a crime. Head Start may increase the likelihood that African-American males graduate from high school. Separately the authors noted larger effects for younger siblings who attended Head Start after an older sibling.

In 1998, Congress mandated an intensive study of the effectiveness of Head Start, the &quot;Head Start Impact Study,&quot; which studied a target population of 5,000 3- and 4-year-old children. The study measured Head Start&#x27;s effectiveness as compared to other forms of community support and educational intervention, as opposed to comparing Head Start to a nonintervention alternative. Head Start Impact Study First Year Findings were released in June 2005. Study participants were assigned to either Head Start or other parent–selected community resources for one year. 60% of the children in the control group were placed in other preschools. The first report showed consistent small to moderate advantages to 3-year-old children including pre-reading, pre-vocabulary and parent reports of children&#x27;s literacy skills. No significant impacts were found for oral comprehension, phonological awareness, or early mathematics skills for either age group. Fewer positive benefits were found for 4-year-olds. The benefits improved with early participation and varied across racial and ethnic groups. These analyses did not assess the benefits&#x27; durability.

In 1975, Seitz, Abelson, Levine and Zigler compared disadvantaged children enrolled and not enrolled in Head Start, using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). The participants were low-income inner-city black children whose unemployed, economically disadvantaged parents were considered unskilled. The Head Start children had attended for at least five months at the time of testing, including nine boys and 11 girls. The non-enrolled group was on the Head Start waiting list. The control group consisted of 11 boys and nine girls. The groups were matched by family income, parental employment and marital status. The tester tested children at home and in a school or office setting. The Head Start children scored higher than the controls in both settings, which suggested preschool intervention programs may have influenced the result. The controls tested at home scored the lowest, apparently due to anxiety from having an unfamiliar person in their homes. The Head Start children were unaffected by the environmental factor. In evaluating this study vs. others, the relatively small sample size should be noted: 20 children vs. thousands in other studies.

A 2005 review of the literature by Barnett and Hustedt found &quot;mixed, but generally positive, evidence regarding Head Start&#x27;s long-term benefits. Although studies typically find that increases in IQ fade out over time, many other studies also find decreases in grade retention and special education placements. Sustained increases in school achievement are sometimes found, but in other cases flawed research methods produce results that mimic fade-out. In recent years, the federal government has funded large-scale evaluations of Head Start and Early Head Start. Results from the Early Head Start evaluation are particularly informative, as study participants were randomly assigned to either the Early Head Start group or a control group. Early Head Start demonstrated modest improvements in children&#x27;s development and parent beliefs and behavior.&quot;

A 1995 within–family analysis compared subjects with nonparticipant siblings. Mothers who had themselves been enrolled in Head Start were compared to adult sisters who were not. Currie and Thomas separately analyzed white, black and Hispanic participants. White children showed larger and longer lasting improvements than black children.

&quot;Head Start Fade&quot;, in which significant initial impacts quickly fade, has often been observed, as early as second and third grade. One hypothesis is that the decline is because Head Start participants are likely to attend lower-quality schools, which fail to reinforce Head Start gains. Fryer and Levitt found no evidence that Head Start participation had lasting effect on test scores in the early years of school.

A 2010 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, &quot;Head Start Impact&quot;, examined the cognitive development, social-emotional development, and physical health outcomes of 4,667 three- and four-year-old children in a nationally representative sample of programs across 23 states. Children were randomly assigned to either a Head Start group (participants) or a non-Head Start group (control group). The children in the two groups were similar in all measured characteristics at program entry. Pre-participation assessments of all critical outcome measures were taken. Control group children optionally enrolled in non-Head Start programs. Nearly half of the control-group children enrolled in other preschool programs. Outcome measures covered cognitive development, social-emotional development, health status and access to health care, and parenting practices. Head Start students were split into two cohorts – 3-year-olds with two years of Head Start and 4-year-olds with one year of Head Start. The study found:
* Participants showed positive effects in cognitive skills during their Head Start years, including letter-naming, vocabulary, letter-word identification and applied math problems, although the &quot;advantages children gained during their Head Start and age 4 years yielded only a few statistically significant differences in outcomes at the end of 1st grade for the sample as a whole. Impacts at the end of kindergarten were scattered. ... &quot; The gains applied to different skills across cohorts and grades, undermining generalizations about program impacts.
* Participants showed fewer significant improvements in social and behavioral skills, even in the Head Start year, with inconsistent results between the three- and four-year-old cohorts. The four-year-old cohort showed no significant improvement in the Head Start year or kindergarten, but in third grade, parents reported a significant reduction in total problem behavior and social and behavioral skills. Three-year-olds showed multiple, significant improvements in social and behavioral skills, but only for outcomes assessed by parents. Significant negative effects emerged in teacher relationships as rated by first-grade and third-grade teachers; and no significant positive effects for this cohort were reported by teachers for any elementary year.
* By the end of first grade, only &quot;a single cognitive impact was found for each cohort&quot;. Compared to students in the control group, the 4-year-old Head Start cohort did &quot;significantly better&quot; on vocabulary and the 3-year-old cohort tested better in oral comprehension.
* Head Start had significant health-related effects, especially in increasing the number of children receiving dental care and having health-insurance coverage. These effects were not consistent, however. For example, while participants increased health-insurance coverage, it did not extend into the third-grade year for either cohort. Parenting practice changes were significant, but applied only to the three-year-old cohort. Most related to discipline, such as reduced spanking or time-outs. The spanking outcome occurred did not last into the first grade. The significant effect on parental reading to children did not last into kindergarten.

The HSIS study concludes, &quot;Head Start has benefits for both 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds in the cognitive, health, and parenting domains, and for 3-year-olds in the social-emotional domain. However, the benefits of access to Head Start at age four are largely absent by 1st grade for the program population as a whole. For 3-year-olds, there are few sustained benefits, although access to the program may lead to improved parent-child relationships through 1st grade, a potentially important finding for children&#x27;s longer-term development.&quot;

In an op-ed piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Head Start Falls Further Behind&quot;, Besharov and Call discuss a 1998 evaluation that led to a national reevaluation of the program. The authors stated that research concluded that the current program had little meaningful impact.

In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s columnist Joe Klein called for the elimination of Head Start, citing an internal report that the program is costly and makes a negligible impact on children&#x27;s well-being over time. Klein wrote, &quot;You take the million or so poorest 3- and 4-year-old children and give them a leg up on socialization and education by providing preschool for them; if it works, it saves money in the long run by producing fewer criminals and welfare recipients ... it is now 45 years later. We spend more than $7 billion providing Head Start to nearly 1 million children each year. And finally there is indisputable evidence about the program&#x27;s effectiveness, provided by the Department of Health and Human Services: Head Start simply does not work.&quot;

W. Steven Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, rebutted Klein, &quot;Weighing all of the evidence and not just that cited by partisans on one side or the other, the most accurate conclusion is that Head Start produces modest benefits including some long-term gains for children.&quot;

== Access ==
There is not enough government funding to provide Head Start for all eligible families, so to enroll in Head Start, families must apply and then be chosen. In 2017, there were 1 million children enrolled in Head Start and Early Head Start, but there were about 19 million children under five in the United States and around 3 million children under five living in poverty.

Head Start covers families living below the federal poverty line, but there 65% of children under the age of 6 having both their parents (or one parent, if they are a single parent) in the workforce. Hotz and Wiswall’s research found that for two-parent households, childcare is the most expensive cost outside their rent or mortgage; in perspective, the median percent of income that goes towards childcare is 30%.

<text>Danna (), was a Palestinian village 13 kilometres north of Baysan that was captured by the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and the villagers were expelled.

==History==
===Byzantine period===
A basalt lintel decorated with a menorah bas-relief, dated to the 5th-6th century and discovered at Kafr Danna, is possibly the only remaining element of a Byzantine synagogue once standing there.

===Ottoman period===
In 1517 Danna was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine. During the 16th and 17th centuries, it belonged to the Turabay Emirate (1517-1683), which encompassed also the Jezreel Valley, Haifa, Jenin, Beit She&#x27;an Valley, northern Jabal Nablus, Bilad al-Ruha/Ramot Menashe, and the northern part of the Sharon plain.

In 1596, Danna was part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Shafa under the &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot; (district) of Lajjun with a population of 5 Muslim families, (estimated 28 people). It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% to the Ottoman government on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, and other types of produce, such as goats and beehives; a total of 3,500 akçe.

Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a Swiss traveler to Palestine who passed through the area around 1817, mentioned the village without providing a description.

In 1838, &quot;Denna&quot; was noted as part of the Jenin District.

Victor Guérin described in 1875 the village as being &quot;humble&quot;, and situated on a hill. He noted that it had once been much larger, as north of the village centre were ruins of houses. In 1882, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Danna as being situated on a slope, and surrounded by farmland. There was a spring with a watering trough to the west. The village houses were built of stone and adobe.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the Mandatory Palestine authorities, Danna had a population of 176 Muslims, decreasing in the 1931 census to 149, still all Muslims, in 28 houses.

The village was shaped like a rectangle whose longer sides were aligned in a north–south direction. During this era the village expanded and new houses, constructed of stone and adobe brick, were built along the road to the nearby village of Kafra. It was classified as a hamlet in the &quot;Palestine Index Gazetteer&quot;. There were a few shops and a mosque which contained the maqam (shrine) of a Shaykh Daniyal. The village spring provided water for all the residents. The villagers worked primarily in rainfed agriculture. 

In the 1945 statistics Danna had a population of 190 Muslims, with a total of 6,614 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 5,097 dunams was used for cereals; 14 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards, while 15 were built-up (urban) land. Grass and leafy vegetation grew on the slopes and peaks of the neighboring mountains and were used for grazing.

===1948, aftermath===
On the 28 May 1948 the village was occupied by Israeli forces, and the villagers were expelled.

According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, 1992, the remaining structures on the village land were: &quot;Bushes, cactus plants, thorns, and grass now grow around piles of rubble on the village site. Thick weeds grow in the wadi and near the springs. The lands in the area are cultivated by Israeli farmers.&quot;

<doc id="267386" wikidata="Q2592638" url="?curid=267386" title="Buckram">
<text>Buckram is a stiff cotton, or occasionally, linen or horse hair cloth with a plain, usually loose, weave, produced in various weights similar to muslin and other plain weave fabrics. The fabric is soaked in a sizing agent such as wheat-starch paste, glue (such as PVA glue), or pyroxylin (gelatinized nitrocellulose, developed around 1910), then dried. When rewetted or warmed, it can be shaped to create durable firm fabric for book covers, hats, and elements of clothing.

==Etymology==
In the Middle Ages, &quot;bokeram&quot; simply designated a fine cotton cloth. The etymology of the term remains uncertain; the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; considers the commonly mentioned derivation from the name of the city of Bokhara unlikely.

==Use in bookbinding==
Several of buckram&#x27;s qualities make it attractive for bookbinding. Highly durable, buckram does not allow the bookbinder&#x27;s paste to seep through and discolor or stain the book&#x27;s front and back covers.

Pyroxylin-impregnated buckram is often favored due to its resistance to water, insects, fungi, and general wear. This is especially important for library binding, where many people will be repeatedly handling the same books. However, pyroxylin fabrics are less chemically stable than starch-filled fabrics and can be affected by extreme temperatures.

==Use in millinery==
Millinery buckram is impregnated with a starch which allows it to be softened in water, pulled over a hat block, and left to dry into a hard shape. Millinery buckram comes in many weights, including lightweight or baby buckram (often used for children&#x27;s and dolls&#x27; hats), single-ply buckram, and double buckram (also known as &quot;theatrical buckram&quot; or &quot;crown buckram&quot;).

<doc id="267394" wikidata="Q1203182" url="?curid=267394" title="Global North and Global South">
<text>Global North and Global South are terms that denote a method of grouping countries based on their defining characteristics with regard to socioeconomics and politics. According to UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the Global South broadly comprises Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia (excluding Israel, Japan, and South Korea), and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand). Most of the Global South&#x27;s countries are commonly identified as lacking in their standard of living, which includes having lower incomes, high levels of poverty, high population growth rates, inadequate housing, limited educational opportunities, and deficient health systems, among other issues. Additionally, these countries&#x27; cities are characterized by their poor infrastructure. Opposite to the Global South is the Global North, which the UNCTAD describes as broadly comprising Northern America and Europe, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. As such, the two terms do not refer to the Northern Hemisphere or the Southern Hemisphere, as many of the Global South&#x27;s countries are geographically located in the former and, similarly, a number of the Global North&#x27;s countries are geographically located in the latter.

More specifically, the Global North consists of the world&#x27;s developed countries, whereas the Global South consists of the world&#x27;s developing countries and least developed countries. The Global South classification, as used by governmental and developmental organizations, was first introduced as a more open and value-free alternative to &quot;Third World&quot;, and likewise potentially &quot;valuing&quot; terms such as developed and developing. Countries of the Global South have also been described as being newly industrialized or in the process of industrializing. Many of them are current or former subjects of colonialism.

The Global North and the Global South are often defined in terms of their differing levels of wealth, economic development, income inequality, and strength of democracy, as well as by their political freedom and economic freedom, as defined by a variety of freedom indices. Countries of the Global North tend to be wealthier, and capable of exporting technologically advanced manufactured products, among other characteristics. In contrast, countries of the Global South tend to be poorer, and heavily dependent on their largely agrarian-based economic primary sectors. Some scholars have suggested that the inequality gap between the Global North and the Global South has been narrowing due to the effects of globalization. Other scholars have disputed this position, suggesting that the Global South has instead become poorer vis-à-vis the Global North in this same timeframe.

Since World War II, the phenomenon of &quot;South–South cooperation&quot; (SSC) to &quot;challenge the political and economic dominance of the North&quot; has become more prominent among the Global South&#x27;s countries. It has become popular in light of the geographical migration of manufacturing and production activity from the Global North to the Global South, and has since influenced the diplomatic policies of the Global South&#x27;s more powerful countries, such as China. Thus, these contemporary economic trends have &quot;enhanced the historical potential of economic growth and industrialization in the Global South&quot; amidst renewed targeted efforts by the SSC to &quot;loosen the strictures imposed during the colonial era, and transcend the boundaries of postwar political and economic geography&quot; as an aspect of decolonization.

== Definition ==

The terms &quot;Global North&quot; and &quot;Global South&quot; are not strictly geographical, and are not &quot;an image of the world divided by the equator, separating richer countries from their poorer counterparts.&quot; Rather, geography should be more readily understood as economic and migratory, in the &quot;wider context of globalization or global capitalism.&quot;

In general, definitions for Global North and Global South, do not refer to the geographical North or the geographical South. The Global North broadly comprises Northern America and Europe, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, as per the UNCTAD. The Global South broadly comprises Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia excluding Israel, Japan, and South Korea, and Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand, also according to the UNCTAD. Some, such as Australian sociologists Fran Collyer and Raewyn Connell, have argued that Australia and New Zealand are marginalized in similar ways to other Global South countries, due to their geographical isolation and location in the Southern Hemisphere.

The term Global North is often used interchangeably with developed countries, whereas the term Global South with developing countries.
Characteristically, most countries in the Global South are commonly identified as lacking in their standard of living, these include having: lower incomes, high levels of poverty, high population growth rates, limited educational opportunities, deficient health care systems, among other issues. Also, cities in the Global South are identified for their poor infrastructure. Economies of the Global North are diversified, whereas agriculture sector is the major contributor to economy activity in the Global South.

== Development of the terms ==

Carl Oglesby used the term &quot;global south&quot; in 1969, writing in Catholic journal &quot;Commonweal&quot; in a special issue on the Vietnam War. Oglesby argued that centuries of northern &quot;dominance over the global south […] [has] converged […] to produce an intolerable social order.&quot;

The term gained appeal throughout the second half of the 20th century, which rapidly accelerated in the early 21st century. It appeared in fewer than two dozen publications in 2004, but in hundreds of publications by 2013. The emergence of the new term meant looking at the troubled realities of its predecessors, i.e.: Third World or Developing World. The term &quot;Global South&quot;, in contrast, was intended to be less hierarchical. Compared to the alternatives, the term has been deemed useful as it constitutes a lens through which this group of countries keep seeing and narrating their problems in a distinctive way vis-à-vis &quot;developed&quot; countries in Europe, North America and Asia.

The idea of categorizing countries by their economic and developmental status began during the Cold War with the classifications of East and West. The Soviet Union and China represented the East, and the United States and their allies represented the West. The term &quot;Third World&quot; came into parlance in the second half of the twentieth century. It originated in a 1952 article by Alfred Sauvy entitled &quot;Trois Mondes, Une Planète&quot;. Early definitions of the Third World emphasized its exclusion from the east–west conflict of the Cold War as well as the ex-colonial status and poverty of the peoples it comprised.

Efforts to mobilize the Third World as an autonomous political entity were undertaken. The 1955 Bandung Conference was an early meeting of Third World states in which an alternative to alignment with either the Eastern or Western Blocs was promoted. Following this, the first Non-Aligned Summit was organized in 1961. Contemporaneously, a mode of economic criticism which separated the world economy into &quot;core&quot; and &quot;periphery&quot; was developed and given expression in a project for political reform which &quot;moved the terms &#x27;North&#x27; and &#x27;South&#x27; into the international political lexicon.&quot;

In 1973, the pursuit of a New International Economic Order which was to be negotiated between the North and South was initiated at the Non-Aligned Summit held in Algiers. Also in 1973, the oil embargo initiated by Arab OPEC countries as a result of the Yom Kippur War caused an increase in world oil prices, with prices continuing to rise throughout the decade. This contributed to a worldwide recession which resulted in industrialized nations increasing economically protectionist policies and contributing less aid to the less developed countries of the South. The slack was taken up by Western banks, which provided substantial loans to Third World countries. However, many of these countries were not able to pay back their debt, which led the IMF to extend further loans to them on the condition that they undertake certain liberalizing reforms. This policy, which came to be known as structural adjustment, and was institutionalized by International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and Western governments, represented a break from the Keynesian approach to foreign aid which had been the norm from the end of the Second World War.

After 1987, reports on the negative social impacts that structural adjustment policies had had on affected developing nations led IFIs to supplement structural adjustment policies with targeted anti-poverty projects. Following the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Second World countries joined the First World, and others joined the Third World. A new and simpler classification was needed. Use of the terms &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; became more widespread.

=== Brandt Line ===


The Brandt Line is a visual depiction of the north–south divide, proposed by West German former Chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1980s in the report titled &quot;North-South: A Programme for Survival&quot; which was later known as the Brandt Report. This line divides the world at a latitude of approximately 30° North, passing between the United States and Mexico, north of Africa and the Middle East, climbing north over China and Mongolia, then dipping south to include Japan, Australia, and New Zealand in the &quot;Rich North&quot;. As of 2023 the Brandt line has been criticised for being outdated, yet is still regarded as a helpful way to visualise global inequalities.

&quot;Global South&quot; &quot;emerged in part to aid countries in the southern hemisphere to work in collaboration on political, economic, social, environmental, cultural, and technical issues.&quot; This is called South–South cooperation (SSC), a &quot;political and economical term that refers to the long-term goal of pursuing world economic changes that mutually benefit countries in the Global South and lead to greater solidarity among the disadvantaged in the world system.&quot; The hope is that countries within the Global South will &quot;assist each other in social, political, and economical development, radically altering the world system to reflect their interests and not just the interests of the Global North in the process.&quot; It is guided by the principles of &quot;respect for national sovereignty, national ownership, independence, equality, non-conditionality, non-interference in domestic affairs, and mutual benefit.&quot; Countries using this model of South–South cooperation see it as a &quot;mutually beneficial relationship that spreads knowledge, skills, expertise and resources to address their development challenges such as high population pressure, poverty, hunger, disease, environmental deterioration, conflict and natural disasters.&quot; These countries also work together to deal with &quot;cross border issues such as environmental protection, HIV/AIDS&quot;, and the movement of capital and labor.

Social psychiatrist Vincenzo Di Nicola has applied the Global South as a bridge between the critiques globalization and the gaps and limitations of the Global Mental Health Movement, invoking Boaventura de Sousa Santos&#x27; notion of &quot;epistemologies of the South&quot; to create a new epistemology for social psychiatry.

== Defining development ==
The Dictionary of Human Geography defines development as &quot;processes of social change or [a change] to class and state projects to transform national economies&quot;.

Economic development is a measure of progress in a specific economy. It refers to advancements in technology, a transition from an economy based largely on agriculture to one based on industry and an improvement in living standards.

Being categorized as part of the &quot;North&quot; implies development as opposed to belonging to the &quot;South&quot;, which implies a lack thereof. According to N. Oluwafemi Mimiko, the South lacks the right technology, it is politically unstable, its economies are divided, and its foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports to the North, along with the fluctuation of prices. The low level of control it exercises over imports and exports condemns the South to conform to the &#x27;imperialist&#x27; system. The South&#x27;s lack of development and the high level of development of the North deepen the inequality between them and leave the South a source of raw material for the developed countries. The North becomes synonymous with economic development and industrialization while the South represents the previously colonized countries which are in need of help in the form of international aid agendas.

Furthermore, in &quot;Regionalism Across the North-South Divide: State Strategies and Globalization,&quot; Jean Grugel stated that the three factors that direct the economic development of states in the Global south are &quot;élite behaviour within and between nation states, integration and cooperation within &#x27;geographic&#x27; areas, and the resulting position of states and regions within the global world market and related political economic hierarchy.&quot;

== Theories explaining the divide ==
The development disparity between the North and the South has sometimes been explained in historical terms. Dependency theory looks back on the patterns of colonial relations which persisted between the North and South and emphasizes how colonized territories tended to be impoverished by those relations. Theorists of this school maintain that the economies of ex-colonial states remain oriented towards serving external rather than internal demand, and that development regimes undertaken in this context have tended to reproduce in underdeveloped countries the pronounced class hierarchies found in industrialized countries while maintaining higher levels of poverty. Dependency theory is closely intertwined with Latin American Structuralism, the only school of development economics emerging from the Global South to be affiliated with a national research institute and to receive support from national banks and finance ministries. The Structuralists defined dependency as the inability of a nation&#x27;s economy to complete the cycle of capital accumulation without reliance on an outside economy. More specifically, peripheral nations were perceived as primary resource exporters reliant on core economies for manufactured goods. This led structuralists to advocate for import-substitution industrialization policies which aimed to replace manufactured imports with domestically made products.

New Economic Geography explains development disparities in terms of the physical organization of industry, arguing that firms tend to cluster in order to benefit from economies of scale and increase productivity which leads ultimately to an increase in wages. The North has more firm clustering than the South, making its industries more competitive. It is argued that only when wages in the North reach a certain height, will it become more profitable for firms to operate in the South, allowing clustering to begin.

=== Associated theories ===
The term of the Global South has many researched theories associated with it. Since many of the countries that are considered to be a part of the Global South were once colonized by Global North countries, they are at a disadvantage to become as quickly developed. Dependency theorists suggest that information has a top-down approach and first goes to the Global North before countries in the Global South receive it. Although many of these countries rely on political or economic help, this also opens up opportunity for information to develop Western bias and create an academic dependency. Meneleo Litonjua describes the reasoning behind distinctive problems of dependency theory as &quot;the basic context of poverty and underdevelopment of Third World/Global South countries was not their traditionalism, but the dominance-dependence relationship between rich and poor, powerful and weak counties.&quot;

What brought about much of the dependency, was the push to become modernized. After World War II, the U.S. made effort to assist developing countries financially in attempt to pull them out of poverty. Modernization theory &quot;sought to remake the Global South in the image and likeliness of the First World/Global North.&quot; In other terms, &quot;societies can be fast-tracked to modernization by &#x27;importing&#x27; Western technical capital, forms of organization, and science and technology to developing countries.&quot; With this ideology, as long as countries follow in Western ways, they can develop quicker.

After modernization attempts took place, theorists started to question the effects through post-development perspectives. Postdevelopment theorists try to explain that not all developing countries need to be following Western ways but instead should create their own development plans. This means that &quot;societies at the local level should be allowed to pursue their own development path as they perceive it without the influences of global capital and other modern choices, and thus a rejection of the entire paradigm from Eurocentric model and the advocation of new ways of thinking about the non-Western societies.&quot; The goals of postdevelopment was to reject development rather than reform by choosing to embrace non-Western ways.

== Challenges ==

The accuracy of the North–South divide has been challenged on a number of grounds. Firstly, differences in the political, economic and demographic make-up of countries tend to complicate the idea of a monolithic South. Globalization has also challenged the notion of two distinct economic spheres. Following the liberalization of post-Mao China initiated in 1978, growing regional cooperation between the national economies of Asia has led to the growing decentralization of the North as the main economic power. The economic status of the South has also been fractured. As of 2015, all but roughly the bottom 60 nations of the Global South were thought to be gaining on the North in terms of income, diversification, and participation in the world market.

However, other scholars, notably Jason Hickel and Robert Wade have suggested that the Global South is not rising economically, and that global inequality between the North and South has risen since globalization. Hickel has suggested that the exchange of resources between the South and the North is substantially unbalanced in favor of the North, with Global North countries extracting a windfall of over 240 trillion dollars from the Global South in 2015. This figure outstrips the amount of financial aid given to Global South by a factor of 30.

Globalization has largely displaced the North–South divide as the theoretical underpinning of the development efforts of international institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, WTO, and various United Nations affiliated agencies, though these groups differ in their perceptions of the relationship between globalization and inequality. Yet some remain critical of the accuracy of globalization as a model of the world economy, emphasizing the enduring centrality of nation-states in world politics and the prominence of regional trade relations. Lately, there have been efforts to integrate the Global South more meaningfully into the world economic order.

The divide between the North and South challenges international environmental cooperation. The economic differences between North and South have created dispute over the scientific evidence and data regarding global warming and what needs to be done about it, as the South do not trust Northern data and cannot afford the technology to be able to produce their own. In addition to these disputes, there are serious divisions over responsibility, who pays, and the possibility for the South to catch up. This is becoming an ever-growing issue with the emergence of rising powers, imploding these three divisions just listed and making them progressively blurry. Multiplicity of actors, such as governments, businesses, and NGO&#x27;s all influence any positive activity that can be taken into preventing further global warming problems with the Global North and Global South divide, contributing to the severity of said actors. Disputes between Northern countries governments and Southern countries governments has led to a breakdown in international discussions with governments from either side disagreeing with each other. Addressing most environmental problems requires international cooperation, and the North and South contribute to the stagnation concerning any form of implementation and enforcement, which remains a key issue.

=== Debates over the term ===
With its development, many scholars preferred using the Global South over its predecessors, such as &quot;developing countries&quot; and &quot;Third World&quot;. Leigh Anne Duck, co-editor of &quot;Global South&quot;, argued that the term is better suited at resisting &quot;hegemonic forces that threaten the autonomy and development of these countries.&quot; The Global South / Global North distinction has been preferred to the older developed / developing dichotomy as it does not imply a hierarchy. Alvaro Mendez, co-founder of the London School of Economics and Political Science&#x27;s Global South Unit, have applauded the empowering aspects of the term. In an article, &quot;Discussion on Global South,&quot; Mendez discusses emerging economies in nations like China, India and Brazil. It is predicted that by 2030, 80% of the world&#x27;s middle-class population will be living in developing countries. The popularity of the term &quot;marks a shift from a central focus on development and cultural difference&quot; and recognizes the importance of geopolitical relations.

Critics of this usage often argue that it is a vague blanket term. Others have argued that the term, its usage, and its subsequent consequences mainly benefit those from the upper classes of countries within the Global South; who stand &quot;to profit from the political and economic reality [of] expanding south-south relations.&quot;

According to scholar Anne Garland Mahler, this nation-based understanding of the Global South is regarded as an appropriation of a concept that has deeper roots in Cold War radical political thought. In this political usage, the Global South is employed in a more geographically fluid way, referring to &quot;spaces and peoples negatively impacted by contemporary capitalist globalization.&quot; In other words, &quot;there are economic Souths in the geographic North and Norths in the geographic South.&quot; Through this geographically fluid definition, another meaning is attributed to the Global South where it refers to a global political community that is formed when the world&#x27;s &quot;Souths&quot; recognize one another and view their conditions as shared.

The geographical boundaries of the Global South remain a source of debate. Some scholars agree that the term is not a &quot;static concept&quot;. Others have argued against &quot;grouping together a large variety of countries and regions into one category [because it] tends to obscure specific (historical) relationships between different countries and/or regions&quot;, and the power imbalances within these relationships. This &quot;may obscure wealth differences within countries – and, therefore, similarities between the wealthy in the Global South and Global North, as well as the dire situation the poor may face all around the world.&quot;

== Future development ==

Some economists have argued that international free trade and unhindered capital flows across countries could lead to a contraction in the North–South divide. In this case more equal trade and flow of capital would allow the possibility for developing countries to further develop economically. Economists such as Martin Khor challenged these arguments by illustrating how the South’s lack of economic capacity and infrastructure limit the movement to reduce the divide.

As some countries in the South experience rapid development, there is evidence that those states are developing high levels of South–South aid. Brazil, in particular, has been noted for its high levels of aid ($1 billion annually—ahead of many traditional donors) and the ability to use its own experiences to provide high levels of expertise and knowledge transfer. This has been described as a &quot;global model in waiting&quot;.

The United Nations has also established its role in diminishing the divide between North and South through the Millennium Development Goals, all of which were to be achieved by 2015. These goals seek to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve global universal education and healthcare, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development. These were replaced in 2015 by 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs, set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and intended to be achieved by 2030, are part of a UN Resolution called &quot;The 2030 Agenda&quot;.

== Society and culture ==
=== Digital and technological divide ===
The global digital divide is often characterized as corresponding to the north–south divide; however, Internet use, and especially broadband access, is now soaring in Asia compared with other continents. This phenomenon is partially explained by the ability of many countries in Asia to leapfrog older Internet technology and infrastructure, coupled with booming economies which allow vastly more people to get online.

=== Media representation ===
Mass media has often compared the Global South to the North, and is thought to be an aid in the divide. Western media tends to present a generalized view of developing countries through biased media coverage, mass media outlets tend to focus disproportionately on poverty and other negative imagery. This common coverage has created a dominant stereotype of developing countries as: &quot;the &#x27;South&#x27; is characterized by socioeconomic and political backwardness, measured against Western values and standards.&quot; 

Mass media has also played a role in what information the people in developing countries receive. The news often covers developed countries and creates an imbalance of information flow.

<text>Amka (), also Amqa (), is a moshav in the Matte Asher Regional Council of Israel&#x27;s Northern District, near Acre. The moshav, located in the vicinity of Amqa, a Palestinian village depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, was founded by Yemenite Jews in 1949. In , its population was .

==Etymology==
Edward Henry Palmer thought that the name Amka derived from the Arabic word for “deep”,
but according to Ringgren, it preserves the name of &quot;Beth Ha-Emek&quot;, a city mentioned in as part of the allotment of the Tribe of Asher.

==History==
===Ancient period===
Amka is identified with &quot;Kefar Amiqo&quot; (), a place mentioned in the Mishnah and Tosefta. Walid Khalidi writes that during the Roman period, the village located at the site was called &quot;Kefar Amqa&quot;. 

===Middle Ages===
During the Crusader period, Amka was referred to as &quot;Amca&quot;. In 1179, Joscelin III acquired the land of the village, and in 1220 Jocelyn III&#x27;s daughter Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Otto von Botenlauben, Count of Henneberg, sold their land, including ‘’Amca’’, to the Teutonic Knights.

In 1283, Amka was mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders during the hudna between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur (Qalawun).

===Ottoman Empire===
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, Amqa appeared in the 1596 tax registers as being in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Akka under the &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot; (district) of Safad, with a population of 215. All the inhabitants were Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on a number of crops, such as wheat, barley, olives, cotton and fruit, and on other types of produce, such as goats and beehives.

In the early 18th century, the village was under control of Shaykh Najm. He had an agreement to sell the cotton from this and other villages under his control exclusively to the Dutch trader Paul Maashook. In return, Maashook would pay the &quot;miri&quot; (tax slated for funding the annual Hajj caravan), which was normally payable by the village shaykhs (chiefs). The Syrian Sufi teacher and traveler Mustafa al-Bakri al-Siddiqi (1688–1748/9), who traveled through the region in the first half of the 18th century, said that he prayed in the village after visiting the citadel of Atlit. In 1776 the village was used as a base by Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar to suppress a revolt led by Ali al-Zahir, one of the sons of Sheikh Zahir al-Umar, who ruled the Galilee between 1730 and 1775.

A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 showed the place, misnamed as &quot;El Mead,&quot; In the late 19th century, the village was described as being built of stone, situated on a slight rise in a valley, surrounded by olive and fig trees, and arable land. There were an estimated 300 Druze living there. Later, the residents were described as Muslims who maintained a village mosque. In 1887, the Ottoman authorities built a school in ´Amqa.

A population list from about 1887 showed that Amka had about 740 inhabitants, all Muslim.

===British Mandate===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Amqa&quot; had a population of 724 inhabitants, of whom 722 were Muslims and two Christians. The population increased in the 1931 census to 895, all Muslims, living in a total of 212 houses.

In 1945, the population of Amqa was 1,240 Muslims, with over of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,648 dunams were plantations and irrigable land; 3,348 used for cereals, while 36 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===Israel===
People from neighboring villages began to seek refuge in &#x27;Amqa in May 1948. The village was attacked on 10-11 July by the Sheva&#x27; (Seventh) Brigade and the First Battalion of the Carmeli Brigade. It was captured on 16 July 1948 during Operation Dekel and largely destroyed, with the exception of the school and mosque. Most of the inhabitants left with the exception of the Druze residents who still live nearby. Some inhabitants remained in Israel as present absentees. On 1 March 1949 a UN observer reported a large group of villagers from &#x27;Amqa seeking refuge in Salim. Another group arrived on 26 March. In February 1950, the village was declared a closed area. The Arab population remained under Martial Law until 1966.

In 1949, a group of Yemenite Jewish immigrants settled in Amka. The elementary school for boys founded in 1887 and the village mosque remained untouched although other structures were razed in the late 1950s. According to Petersen, the mosque and school were used as warehouses.

==Archaeological sites==
Three khirbas (archaeological ruins) lay within Amka&#x27;s vicinity and contain the foundations of buildings, well-chiseled building stones, presses, and a cistern. During archaeological searches of the area remnants of a Byzantine church were discovered but due to the destruction of the village no foundations could be established. The Amka mosque was inspected by Petersen in 1991. The date of the mosque construction is not known, but it bears a general similarity to the nearby mosque of al-Ghabisiyya, and is probably of a similar age, i.e. early 19th century.

<text>Mi&#x27;ar (), was a Palestinian village located 17.5 kilometers east of Acre. Its population in 1945 was 770. The Crusaders referred to it as &quot;Myary&quot;. By the 19th century, during Ottoman rule, it was a large Muslim village. The village was a center of Palestinian Arab rebel operations during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine against British rule and consequently the village was completely dynamited by the British. Mi&#x27;ar was later restored, but it was depopulated by Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The Jewish communities of Atzmon, Ya&#x27;ad and Manof are located on former village land.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
Mi&#x27;ar contained the archaeological remains of buildings, fragments of columns, olive presses, and cisterns. It was referred to by the Crusaders as &quot;Myary&quot;.

===Ottoman era===
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, Mi&#x27;ar appeared in the 1596 tax registers as being in the Akka Nahiya (Subdistrict of Acre), part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). It had a population 10 Muslim households, an estimated 55 persons. The villagers paid fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat and barley, fruit, goats and beehives; a total of 1,235 akçe.

In the late 1700, the Italian traveler Giovanni Mariti noted that around al-Damun and Mi&#x27;ar were two &quot;delightful valleys, ornamented with groves and wild shrubs. The peasants who live in the hamlets around, enjoy a most pleasant situation.&quot; 

In 1875, French explorer Victor Guérin visited Mi&#x27;ar, and noted that it contained &quot;several trunks of columns, three broken capitals, and a certain number old cut stones, coming from some ancient building. I observed also many blocks of ancient appearance disposed round threshing-floors. There are also cisterns, walls, and caves cut in the rock, which belong to times more or less remote.&quot; He found Mi&#x27;ar to be inhabited by 500 Muslims.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described it as a large village situated on high ground that was rough and uncultivated. The villagers, whose number was estimated to be 1,500 (in 1859), cultivated some 30 faddans. A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;Mi&#x27;ar&quot; had about 480 inhabitants; all Muslims. An elementary school was founded by the Ottomans in 1888, however, it closed its doors in the final years of the Empire.

===British Mandate era===

British forces drove out the Ottomans in 1917, during World War I, and the British Mandate of Palestine was established in 1920. In the 1922 British census, Mi&#x27;ar had a population of 429 Muslims. The population increased to 543, still all Muslim, in the 1931 census and the inhabitants lived in a total of 109 houses.

A number of Mi&#x27;ar&#x27;s residents participated in 1936–1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine, and the village became a center of rebel operations in the Galilee. The rebels often opened fired on British troops passing near Mi&#x27;ar, damaged roads in the vicinity to render them impassable by the British authorities, cut electrical cables, and planted landmines to hit British vehicles. One of the authorities&#x27; controversial methods of suppressing the revolt was the blowing up of houses in a village where there was support for rebels. On 26 October 1938, two British battalions launched a raid against Mi&#x27;ar and began dynamiting the large houses of the village. They then demanded Mi&#x27;ar&#x27;s &quot;mukhtar&quot; (headman) to issue a call to the village&#x27;s rebels to surrender their rifles or else the dynamiting would continue. No rifles were surrendered and the British resumed their dynamiting of the village&#x27;s homes. Mi&#x27;ar was entirely destroyed for its alleged support of the rebels. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter present during the destruction wrote, &quot;When the [British] troops left, there was little else remaining of this once busy village except a pile of mangled masonry.&quot;

The village was rebuilt and in the 1945 statistics, the population of Mi&#x27;ar grew to 770, all Muslims. A total of 2,878 dunams of village land was used for cereals, while 113 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards.

===1948 War and aftermath===
According to Ilan Pappé, on 20 June 1948 Israeli troops entered Mi&#x27;ar and shot indiscriminately against its residents while they were working in their fields, the village&#x27;s houses were destroyed and forty inhabitants were killed. One witness to the Israeli attack was the Palestinian writer, Muhammad Ali Taha, then a 17-year-old boy. Mi&#x27;ar&#x27;s residents later returned and continued living in the village until Israeli troops from the Sheva Brigade reoccupied it on 15 July 1948, as part of the second stage of Operation Dekel. According to Benny Morris, Mi&#x27;ar&#x27;s 893 inhabitants fled during the Israeli assault, while Pappé asserts that they were expelled.

The Jewish communities of Segev (now Atzmon), Ya&#x27;ad and Manof were built on Mi&#x27;ar&#x27;s lands. The village&#x27;s remains in 1992 consisted of &quot;some truncated stone walls, simple graves, and fig and olive trees&quot;. The site, which &quot;was largely covered by cypress trees&quot; had become a recreational area.

Many of the refugees of Mi&#x27;ar became internally displaced Palestinians resettled in nearby Kabul, Sha&#x27;ab and Arraba. Neighborhoods in each of the villages where Mi&#x27;ar refugees and their descendants reside are named Mi&#x27;ari after their village of origin.

<text>:&quot;See Mansura (disambiguation) for other places with similar names.&quot;
Al-Mansura (), was a Palestinian village that was depopulated by the Israeli army during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. In 1945, it had a population of 2,300 together with the neighboring villages of Dayr al-Qassi (also depopulated) and Fassuta. The population was predominantly Christian and most its residents live in what is now the state of Israel.

It was situated on the northern end of a mountain in the Upper Galilee whose summit was behind the village to the south. It was connected to the coastal Acre-Ras al-Naqoura highway via a secondary road.

==History==

The village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517; in 1596 it appeared under the name of &quot;al-Mansura&quot; in the tax registers as part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Jira in the &quot;Sanjak&quot; (district) of Safed. It had an all Muslim population, consisting of 17 households and 5 bachelors. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues and an olive oil press; the taxes totalled 3,656 akçe. All of the taxes went to a Waqf.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described the place as having &quot;A few heaps of stones and some foundations. The masonry is medium-size, and well-dressed. The door-posts are of stone; there are cisterns on top of the hill, which is steep.&quot;

===British Mandate era===
Until 1923, after borders were renegotiated between the British and French governments (who controlled the northern and southern parts of the Levant, respectively, at the time), al-Mansura was a part of Lebanon. Afterward it became part of the Mandatory Palestine and was described as a hamlet by the &quot;Palestine Index Gazetteer&quot;.

In the 1931 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate government, it was counted under the much larger Christian village of Fassuta. The total population of the two places were 688 inhabitants; 81 Muslims and 607 Christians, in a total of 129 houses. The houses of al-Mansura were spaciously separated from each other and the village had a church dedicated to Mari Yohanna (John the Baptist). The chief source of income was from agriculture and husbandry and the main sources of drinking water came from a well to the north and three water tanks.

In the 1945 statistics, its land was grouped with the lands of Fassuta (existent) and Dayr al-Qassi; the total population was 2,300 and their total land area was 34,011 dunums. 1,607 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 6,475 used for cereals, while 247 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===Israeli period===
Al-Mansura was believed to have been attacked during the Israeli offensive Operation Hiram in October 1948. In mid-November, the Israeli Army had Palestinian Arab villages on the Lebanese border cleared, including al-Mansura. Its residents were expelled from the village, with some leaving for Lebanon while most were sent to the Arab town of Rameh in the heart of the Galilee. The Maronite Church requested that the Israeli government allow al-Mansura&#x27;s inhabitants to resettle the village but were refused. The residents of al-Mansura continued to demand permission from the Israeli courts to resettle for some time after, but were unsuccessful.

Several Jewish localities have been built on al-Mansura&#x27;s lands, including Elkosh established in 1949, the military base Biranit in the early 1950s, Netu&#x27;a in 1966, Mattat in 1979 and Abirim in 1980. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi whose researchers visited the village before 1992, &quot;The village houses have been completely leveled. Much of the resulting debris has been pushed together in heaps along the northern edge of the site.&quot; The only structure remaining was the partially collapsed church.

<doc id="267412" wikidata="Q18859" url="?curid=267412" title="Common redshank">
<text>The common redshank or simply redshank (Tringa totanus) is a Eurasian wader in the large family Scolopacidae.

==Taxonomy==
The common redshank was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Scolopax totanus&quot;. It is now placed with twelve other species in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot; that Linnaeus had introduced in 1758. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific &quot;totanus&quot; is from , the Italian name for this bird.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;T. t. robusta&quot; (Schiøler, 1919) – breeds in Iceland and the Faroe Islands; non-breeding around the British Isles and west Europe
* &quot;T. t. totanus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – breeds in west, north Europe to west Siberia; winters in Africa, India and Indonesia
* &quot;T. t. ussuriensis&quot; Buturlin, 1934 – breeds in southern Siberia, Mongolia and east Asia; non-breeding in Africa, India and southeast Asia
* &quot;T. t. terrignotae&quot; Meinertzhagen, R. &amp; Meinertzhagen, A., 1926 – breeds in southern Manchuria and eastern China; non-breeding in east and southeast Asia 
* &quot;T. t. craggi&quot; Hale, 1971 – breeds in northwest China; non-breeding in east and southeast Asia
* &quot;T. t. eurhina&quot; (Oberholser, 1900) – breeds in Tajikistan, north India and Tibet; non-breeding in India and the Malay Peninsula

== Description==
Common redshanks in breeding plumage are a marbled brown color, slightly lighter below. In winter plumage they become somewhat lighter-toned and less patterned, being rather plain greyish-brown above and whitish below. They have red legs and a black-tipped red bill, and show white up the back and on the wings in flight.

The spotted redshank (&quot;T. erythropus&quot;), which breeds in the Arctic, has a longer bill and legs; it is almost entirely black in breeding plumage and very pale in winter. It is not a particularly close relative of the common redshank, but rather belongs to a high-latitude lineage of largish shanks. &quot;T. totanus&quot; on the other hand is closely related to the marsh sandpiper (&quot;T. stagnatilis&quot;), and closer still to the small wood sandpiper (&quot;T. glareola&quot;). The ancestors of the latter and the common redshank seem to have diverged around the Miocene-Pliocene boundary, about 5–6 million years ago. These three subarctic- to temperate-region species form a group of smallish shanks with have red or yellowish legs, and in breeding plumage are generally a subdued light brown above with some darker mottling, and have somewhat diffuse small brownish spots on the breast and neck.

==Distribution and habitat==
The common redshank is a widespread breeding bird across temperate Eurasia. It is a migratory species, wintering on coasts around the Mediterranean, on the Atlantic coast of Europe from Ireland and Great Britain southwards, and in South Asia. They are uncommon vagrants outside these areas; on Palau in Micronesia for example, the species was recorded in the mid-1970s and in 2000.
A tagged redshank was spotted at Manakudi Bird Sanctuary, Kanniyakumari District of Tamil Nadu, India in the month of April 2021.

==Behaviour and ecology==
They are wary and noisy birds which will alert everything else with their loud piping call.

===Breeding===
Redshanks will nest in any wetland, from damp meadows to saltmarsh, often at high densities. They lay 3–5 eggs.

===Food and feeding===
Like most waders, they feed on small invertebrates.

==Status==
The common redshank is widely distributed and quite plentiful in some regions, and thus not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

<text>The Père David&#x27;s deer (Elaphurus davidianus), also known as the milu () or elaphure, is a species of deer native to the subtropical river valleys of China. It grazes mainly on grass and aquatic plants. It is the only extant member of the genus &quot;Elaphurus&quot;. Some experts suggest demoting &quot;Elaphurus&quot; to a subgenus of &quot;Cervus&quot;. Based on genetic comparisons, Père David&#x27;s deer is closely related to Eld&#x27;s deer.

Père David&#x27;s deer were hunted almost to extinction in their native China by the late 19th century, but a number were taken to zoos in France and Germany and the deer was bred successfully in captivity. In the early 20th century, the British nobleman and politician Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, acquired a few Père David&#x27;s deer from the Berlin Zoo and built up a large herd on his estate at Woburn Abbey. In the 1980s, the duke&#x27;s great-grandson Robin Russell, 14th Duke of Bedford, donated several dozen deer to the Chinese government for reintroducing the species to the wild. As of 2020, the wild population in China was an estimated 2,825 individuals, with a further 7,380 in various nature reserves in China. All Père David&#x27;s deer alive today descend from Herbrand Russell&#x27;s original herd.

==Demography==
The Père David&#x27;s deer is endemic to the Chinese region. According to fossil records, the species first appeared during the Pleistocene period, when it could be found across Manchuria. This demography changed during the Holocene period; during this time, the species could only be found in the swamp lands and wetlands of southern China. Due to hunting and land reclamation, the population of the Père David&#x27;s deer became even smaller. By 1939, the last of the wild species were shot and killed.

==Naming and etymology==
This species of deer was first made known to Western science in 1866 by Armand David (Père David), a French missionary working in China. He obtained some hides and the carcasses of an adult male, an adult female and a young male, and sent them to Paris, where the species was named &quot;Père David&#x27;s deer&quot; by Alphonse Milne-Edwards, a French biologist.

The species is sometimes known by its informal name &quot;sibuxiang&quot; (; Japanese: &quot;shifuzō&quot;), literally meaning &quot;four not alike&quot;, which could mean &quot;the four unlikes&quot; or &quot;like none of the four&quot;; it is variously said that the four are cow, deer, donkey, horse (or) camel, and that the expression means in detail:
* &quot;the hooves of a cow but not a cow, the neck of a camel but not a camel, antlers of a deer but not a deer, the tail of a donkey but not a donkey.&quot;
* &quot;the nose of a cow but not a cow, the antlers of a deer but not a deer, the body of a donkey but not a donkey, tail of a horse but not a horse&quot;
* &quot;the tail of a donkey, the head of a horse, the hoofs of a cow, the antlers of a deer&quot;
* &quot;the neck of a camel, the hoofs of a cow, the tail of a donkey, the antlers of a deer&quot;
* &quot;the antlers of a deer, the head of a horse and the body of a cow&quot;

By this name, this undomesticated animal entered Chinese mythology as the mount of Jiang Ziya in &quot;Fengshen Bang&quot; (translated as &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;), a Chinese classical work of fiction written during the Ming dynasty.

==Characteristics==

The adult Père David&#x27;s deer reaches a head-and-body length of up to and stands about tall at the shoulder. The tail is relatively long for a deer, measuring when straightened. Weight is between . The head is long and slender with large eyes, very large preorbital glands, a naked nose pad and small, pointed ears.

The branched antlers are unique in that the long tines point backward, while the main beam extends almost directly upward. There may be two pairs per year. The summer antlers are the larger set, and are dropped in November, after the summer rut. The second set—if they appear—are fully grown by January, and fall off a few weeks later.

The coat is reddish tan in the summer, changing to a dull gray in the winter. Long wavy guard hairs are present on and coat throughout the year, with the coat becoming woolier in winter. There is a mane on the neck and throat and a black dorsal stripe running along the cervicothoracic spine. The tail is about in length, with a dark tuft at the end. The hooves are large and spreading, and make clicking sounds (as in the reindeer) when the animal is moving.

A semiaquatic animal, Père David&#x27;s deer swims well, spending long periods standing in water up to its shoulders. Although predominantly a grazer, the deer supplements its grass diet with aquatic plants in the summer.

== Behavior ==
Père David&#x27;s deer has similar reproductive physiological mechanisms to other deer species living in temperate latitudes. These mechanisms aid in the adaptation to a high-latitude environment. The reproductive behavior in stags differs from hinds.
In stags rutting behavior includes urine sniffing, anogenital sniffing, wallowing, and antler adorning. Communication behavior includes the spraying of urine and preorbital gland marking. The stags generally begin to rut before any signs of female sexual behavior. The reason to this is to establish a social rank among the stags. For Père David&#x27;s deer the stag initiates the breeding season with the rutting.
In hinds, estrous behavior includes urinating frequently, receptivity, and allowing the stags to mount. Parental behavior involves sniffing the calf, calling, and rubbing the face of the calf. The hind has a typical behavior of being solitary.
=== Birth and lifespan ===
The gestation period is about nine months, roughly around 280 days, after which a single offspring is usually born; twins are born rarely. The gestation period is significantly longer than any other deer besides the roe deer. Père David&#x27;s deer are considered seasonal breeders because three out of four calves are born during April in captive European populations. The breeding season is 160 days with the mating season usually being in June and July. Calf weight, calculated using Robbins and Robbins equation, tends to be between 11.3 and 13.2 kg. The juveniles (referred to as either &quot;fawns&quot; or &quot;calves&quot;) have a spotted coat, as is commonly seen in most species of deer. They are known to develop very quickly after birth. They reach sexual maturity at about 14 months. The average lifespan of a Père David deer is up to 18 years.

=== In captivity ===
An experiment was conducted to show how captivity would affect the deer&#x27;s behavior and survival rate. Two areas were created; one with a large area containing a few Père David&#x27;s deer present and one with a small area containing a high concentration of Père David&#x27;s deer present. It was found when in captivity, it is best to keep the deer in large open areas that allow for adequate space with a reasonable number of individual deer living in the area; if put in a small area with a multitude of individuals present, stress amongst the deer will build up. Studies have shown through the high concentration of fecal matter in an area of captivity with limited space and a large number of Père David deer that they have shown different behavioral patterns to their wild counterparts. These deer would spend less time resting, and would stand longer due to human presence as well as display social aggression and competition over food sources. It is therefore unwise to keep them in small, densely populated areas to prevent accumulation of stress and aggression against each other.

The Père David&#x27;s deer has been in isolation from the wild for more than 1200 years, causing humans to be the primary perceived threat due to a long-term lack of exposure to other natural predators. When encountering humans, the deer&#x27;s response varies according to sex. Female-only groups display a lower degree of caution towards humans than in male-only groups. It was hypothesized that the presence of a single type of threat may be sufficient to maintain anti-predator responses in the face of relaxed predation pressure. During rutting season, the does will display increased vigilance and heightened threat perception, likely in response to the mating activities of the males.

===Predation===
Historically, the main predators of the Père David&#x27;s deer are believed to have been tigers and leopards. Although they no longer encounter these predators while living in captivity, while experimenting with exposures to images and stimuli relating to these big cats, the deer seemed to instinctively react with a cautious predator–prey response typical of wild deer.

==Population==

In Neolithic times, the &quot;milu&quot;&#x27;s range extended across much of China proper. Archaeologists have found &quot;milu&quot; antlers at settlements from the Liao River in the north to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province and across the Yellow and Yangtze River Basins in Shaanxi and Hunan Province. According to official data, the total population of the species has exceeded 8,000 in China. &quot;Milu&quot; is also under first-class state protection in China. In 1985, China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF) was established to help receive 22 Père David&#x27;s deer from the Marquess of Tavistock of Woburn Abbey, England as a gift to return to their ancestral soil.

===Extirpation in China===
In the late 19th century, the world&#x27;s only herd belonged to Tongzhi, the Emperor of China. The herd was maintained in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in Nan Haizi, near Peking. In 1895, one of the walls of the hunting garden was destroyed by a heavy flood of the Yongding River, and most of the deer escaped and some of them were killed and eaten by starving peasants. Fewer than thirty Père David&#x27;s deer remained in the garden. Then in 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the garden was occupied by troops from the German Empire and all the remaining deer were shot and eaten by the soldiers, leaving the Père David&#x27;s deer extirpated in its native China. A few of the deer had been legally obtained by the French and British Missions in Beijing and transported to various European zoos for exhibition and breeding. After the extirpation of the Chinese population in 1900, the English nobleman Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, was instrumental in saving the species. He acquired the few remaining deer from European zoos and formed a breeding herd in the deer park at his home at Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire. Threatened again by both World Wars, the species survived largely due to the efforts of Bedford and his son Hastings, later 12th Duke of Bedford. The current world population, now found in zoos around the world, stems from the Woburn Abbey herd. Only three founders (1 male, two females) from the Berlin Zoo contributed to the current population of more than 5,000.

===Reintroduction===

Reintroduction of Père David&#x27;s deer to China began in 1985, with a herd of 20 deer (5 males and 15 females). This was followed in 1987 by a second herd, consisting of 18 deer (all females). Both herds had been drawn from the Woburn Abbey herd and were donated by Robin Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (d. 2003; the future 14th Duke of Bedford), the 11th duke&#x27;s great-grandson. In 2005 the Beijing authorities erected a statue of the 14th duke at Nan Haizi to mark the 20th anniversary of the Milu reintroduction. The transportation was sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund. The relic site of the Nanyuan (or Nan Haizi) Royal Hunting Garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was chosen as the site of re-introduction, creating the Beijing Milu Park. The population in China expanded to around 2,000 in 2005.

A second re-introduction into China was conducted in 1986 where 36 Père David&#x27;s deer were chosen from five UK zoological gardens with the bulk of the deer coming from Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire. These deer were introduced into Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve, near the Yellow Sea coast in eastern China. In 2006 the population at this Nature Reserve had reached around 950 with an average annual population increase of 17%.

Of 1993, 30 deer taken from the herd at Beijing Milu Park were released into the Tian&#x27;ezhou Milu National Nature Reserve (a.k.a. Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve) in , Shishou. These were followed by another 34 deer taken from Beijing Park and released into the Tian&#x27;ezhou Reserve. In a 1998 flood, a number of deer escaped from the reserve and have since been living and multiplying in the wild. As of 2015, the number of deer living in the wild is 700. The average annual population growth rate for Père David&#x27;s deer in Tianezhou Nature Reserve was 22.2%.

In 2002, 30 deer taken from the herd at Beijing Milu Park and 20 from Dafeng Nature Reserve were released into the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve.

When the species was assessed for the IUCN Red List (1996), it was classified as &quot;critically endangered&quot; in the wild, under criterion &quot;D&quot;: &quot;[wild] population estimated to number less than 50 mature individuals&quot;. In October 2008, they were officially listed as extinct in the wild. Upon the status being updated in March 2016, it was clarified on this species&#x27; IUCN Red List page that it would remain listed as &quot;Extinct in the Wild&quot; until the reintroduced population proved long-term viability. Today, there are 53 herds of Père David&#x27;s deer in China. Nine of the herds consist of 25 or under deer, and the remaining herds have under 10 deer. Due to the small population size a lack of genetic diversity is expected, but in spite of the small population size, the animals do not appear to suffer genetic problems from the genetic bottleneck. The captive population in China has increased in recent years, and the possibility remains that free-ranging populations can be reintroduced in the near future.

When reintroduced into their habitat, the species could face many problems due to years in captivity. Relaxed selection and reproduction with no environmental pressure may have taken place for Père David&#x27;s deer, due to captive breeding, which can result in the loss of adaptive anti-predator behavior. It is possible that when fully released in the environment from captivity, after generations of offspring, the species could be unable to retain parasite-defense behaviors like grooming. If the population is reintroduced into the environment with no protection against tick infestation, then they can face major problems if not adapted to that environment. Père David&#x27;s deer may also become confused by other predators such as tigers, since they are no longer adapted to them. A study was done on members of the species in captivity using the sounds of wild tigers roaring and domestic dogs barking, and the deer did not respond to the barking of the dogs, but hearing the tiger roar caused the deer to spend more time being cautious after hearing the sound, thus showing that the deer still retained ancestral memories of their previous predator, the tiger.

===Red deer hybrid ===
Though New Zealand lacked its own terrestrial mammals, European settlers had introduced numerous species of deer into the land for the use of farming and hunting. Some of these deer species had crossbred in the wild, creating hybrids, which in turn were then utilized in deer farms based on their apparent genetic improvements. Alongside this discovery, deer farms began the practice of inciting hybridization in order to encourage genetic advancement. This includes a hybrid between Père David&#x27;s deer and Red deer. These F1 hybrids are unique for several reasons. To begin with, both male and female offspring of this hybrid remain fertile, a rare prospect especially for species that have such a genetic distance. Both species differ in seasonal behaviors, gestation length, behavioral traits, morphology, maturity size, and disease resistance. Père David&#x27;s deer is also unique in that its antlers are unlike any other deer in the world. However, due to having different seasonal behavior each species would enter their mating season at different intervals, thus preventing natural mating from occurring. In response, artificial insemination was employed on Red deer hinds with the semen from Père David&#x27;s deer. These F1 hybrids did not share similar mating seasons with Père David&#x27;s deer and as such were able to successfully mate with other red deer naturally. Three F1 hybrid stags successfully mated naturally in a period from 1989 to 1991 with 144 hinds and semen had been used to artificially inseminate 114 other Red deer hinds producing over 300 backcross hybrids.

==Legend and cultural significance==

According to Chinese legend, when the tyrant King Zhou of Shang ruled the land more than 3,000 years ago, a horse, a donkey, an ox and a deer went into a cave in the forest to meditate and on the day the King executed his minister Bigan, the animals awoke from their meditation and turned into humans. They entered society, learned of the King&#x27;s heinous acts and wanted to take recourse against the King, who was powerful. So they transformed themselves into one creature that combined the speed of the horse, the strength of the ox, the donkey&#x27;s keen sense of direction and the nimble agility of the deer. This new animal then galloped to the Kunlun Mountains to seek the advice of the Primeval Lord of Heaven. The Lord was astonished at the sight of a creature that had antlers of a deer, hooves of an ox, face of a horse and tail of a donkey. &quot;It&#x27;s unlike any of four creatures!&quot; he exclaimed. Upon learning of the animal&#x27;s quest, Lord gave his blessing and dispatched the creature to his disciple the sage Jiang Ziya, who was battling the King. Jiang Ziya rode the creature to victory over the King and helped found the Zhou dynasty. After fulfilling its vow, the &quot;milu&quot; settled in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The animal became a symbol of good fortune and was sought by later emperors who believed eating the meat of the &quot;milu&quot; would lead to everlasting life.

<text>Al-Nabi Rubin (, literally &quot;Prophet Rubin&quot; or &quot;Prophet Reuben&quot;), was a Palestinian village located 28 kilometers northeast of Acre. Al-Nabi Rubin students used to attend school in the nearby village of Tarbikha.

==History==
===Ottoman era===
In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described Al-Nabi Rubin: This is a small village round the tomb of the Neby, containing about ninety Moslems, it is situated on a prominent top, and surrounded by many olives, a few figs and arable land; there are two cisterns and a &quot;birket&quot; near.

===British rule===
In the 1945 statistics the population Tarbikha, Suruh and Al-Nabi Rubin together was 1000 Muslims according to an official land and population survey, all were Muslims, and they had a total of 18,563 dunams of land. 619 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 3,204 used for cereals, while 112 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===Israeli period===
The village was captured by Israel as a result of the Haganah&#x27;s offensive, Operation Hiram during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and was mostly destroyed with the exception of its shrine. Al-Nabi Rubin inhabitants were expelled to Lebanon in two waves, the aged and infirm were the last to depart when the IDF trucked them to the Lebanese border.

A shrine thought to be dedicated to the prophet Rubin is the only original structure that remains on former village&#x27;s lands.

<doc id="267422" wikidata="Q510281" url="?curid=267422" title="George Anson, 1st Baron Anson">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet George Anson, 1st Baron Anson, (23 April 1697 – 6 June 1762) was a British Royal Navy officer, politician and peer from the Anson family. 

He served as a junior officer during the War of the Spanish Succession and then saw active service against Spain at the Battle of Cape Passaro, off the south tip of Sicily, during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. He then undertook a circumnavigation of the globe during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. Anson commanded the fleet that defeated the French Admiral de la Jonquière at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747, during the War of the Austrian Succession.

Anson went on to be First Lord of the Admiralty during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Among his reforms were the removal of corrupt defence contractors, improved medical care, submitting a revision of the Articles of War to Parliament to tighten discipline throughout the Navy, uniforms for commissioned officers, the transfer of the Marines from Army to Navy authority, and a system for rating ships according to their number of guns.

==Background==
=== Family ===
Anson was the son of William Anson of Shugborough in Staffordshire and Isabella Carrier, whose brother-in-law was the Earl of Macclesfield and Lord Chancellor, a relationship that proved very useful to the future admiral. He was born on 23 April 1697, at Shugborough Manor. He was one of eight surviving children of the couple, and the younger brother of the politician Thomas Anson.

=== Early career ===
In February 1712, amid the War of the Spanish Succession, Anson entered the navy at the age of 15. He served as a volunteer aboard the fourth-rate , before transferring to the third-rate .

Promoted to lieutenant on 17 March 1716, he was assigned to the fourth-rate in service as part of a Baltic Sea fleet commanded by Admiral John Norris. Anson transferred to the aging fourth-rate in March 1718, and saw active service against Spain at the Battle of Cape Passaro in August 1718 during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. He then transferred to the second-rate , flagship of Admiral George Byng, in October 1719.

Anson was promoted to commander in June 1722 and given command of the small 8-gun HMS &quot;Weazel&quot;. Anson&#x27;s orders were to suppress smuggling between Britain and Holland, a task he swiftly and effectively performed. In recognition of his efforts he was promoted to the rank of post-captain in February 1723 and given command of the 32-gun sixth-rate HMS &quot;Scarborough&quot; with orders to escort British merchant convoys from the Carolinas. (The Ansonborough district of Charleston, South Carolina, still commemorates his time there.)

He transferred to the command of the sixth-rate HMS &quot;Garland&quot;, still on the Carolinas station, in July 1728, then to the command of the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Diamond&quot; in the Channel Fleet in 1730, and to the command of the sixth-rate HMS &quot;Squirrel&quot; back on the Carolinas station in 1731. He was given command of the 60-gun third-rate in the West Africa Squadron in 1737 and, having been promoted to commodore with his broad pennant in HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;, he took command of a squadron sent to attack Spanish possessions in South America at the outset of the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear.

==Voyage around the world==

After setting off later than planned, Anson&#x27;s squadron encountered successive disasters. The lateness of the season forced him to round the Horn in very stormy weather, and the navigating instruments of the time did not allow for exact observations. Two of his vessels, the fifth-rate and the fourth-rate , failed to round Cape Horn and returned home. Meanwhile, the sixth-rate was wrecked off the coast of Chile, where the crew subsequently mutinied.

By the time Anson reached the Juan Fernández Islands in June 1741, only three of his six ships remained (HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;, the fourth-rate , and the sloop HMS &quot;Tryall&quot;), while the strength of his crews had fallen from 961 to 335. In the absence of any effective Spanish force on the coast, he was able to harass the enemy and to sack the small port city of Paita in Peru in November 1741. The steady decrease of his crews by scurvy and the worn-out state of his remaining consorts compelled him to collect all the remaining survivors in &quot;Centurion&quot;. He rested at the island of Tinian, and then made his way to Macau in November 1742.

After considerable difficulties with the Chinese, he sailed again with his one remaining vessel to cruise in search of one of the Manila galleons that conducted the trade between Mexico and the Chinese merchants in the Philippines, where he captured the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Covadonga&quot; with 1,313,843 pieces of eight on board, which he had encountered off Cape Espiritu Santo on 20 June 1743. The charts captured with the ship added many islands (and phantom islands) to the British knowledge of the Pacific, including the so-called Anson Archipelago.

Anson took his prize back to Macau, sold her cargo to the Chinese, kept the specie, and sailed for England via the Cape of Good Hope. Passing by means of a thick fog a French fleet then patrolling the Channel, he reached England on 15 June 1744. The prize money earned from the capture of the galleon made Anson a rich man for life and bought him considerable political influence. He initially refused promotion to Rear-Admiral of the Blue however, out of anger that the Admiralty refused to sanction a captain&#x27;s commission he had given one of his officers.

==Naval command==
=== Senior officer ===
Anson was elected Member of Parliament for Hedon in the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1744. He joined the Board of Admiralty led by the Duke of Bedford in December 1744. Promoted to Rear-Admiral of the White on 23 April 1745 and to vice-admiral of the blue in July 1745, he took command of the Western Squadron, with his flag in the third-rate , in July 1746.
Anson commanded the fleet that defeated the Marquis de la Jonquière at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre in May 1747 during the War of the Austrian Succession. His force captured the entire French squadron: four ships of the line, two frigates, and six merchantmen The treasure amounted to £300,000. He was elevated to the peerage as Baron Anson, &quot;of Soberton, in the County of Southampton&quot;, on 11 June 1747. In 1748, the memoir of Anson&#x27;s circumnavigation—&quot;Voyage Round the World in the Years MDCCXL, I, II, III, IV&quot;—was published, having been edited from his notes and Richard Walter&#x27;s journals by Benjamin Robins. It was a vast popular and commercial success. He was promoted to admiral of the blue on 12 May 1748 and became Vice-Admiral of Great Britain on 4 July 1749. He was advanced to Senior Naval Lord on the Admiralty Board in November 1749.

=== First Lord of the Admiralty === 
Anson became First Lord of the Admiralty in the Broad Bottom Ministry in June 1751 and continued to serve during the first Newcastle ministry. Among his reforms was the removal of corrupt defence contractors, improved medical care, submitting a revision of the Articles of War to Parliament so tightening discipline throughout the Navy, uniforms for commissioned officers, the transfer of the Marines from Army to Navy authority and a system for rating ships according to their number of guns.

Anson oversaw the Navy for much of the Seven Years&#x27; War, and established a permanent squadron at Devonport which could patrol the western approaches to both Britain and France. He was particularly concerned at the prospect of a French invasion of the British Isles which led him to keep a large force in the English Channel. In 1756 he was criticised for not sending enough ships with Admiral Byng to relieve Minorca because he wanted to protect Britain from a threatened invasion, only to see Byng fail to save Minorca while no invasion attempt materialised. He left the Admiralty when the Newcastle ministry fell in November 1756 and then served again as First Lord when the Pitt–Newcastle ministry was created in June 1757.

In July 1758, after Edward Hawke had decided to strike his flag and return to port over a misunderstanding at which he took offence, Anson hoisted his own flag in the first-rate and took over command of the Western Squadron again. Anson oversaw Britain&#x27;s naval response to a more serious French invasion attempt in 1759. He instituted a close blockade of the French coast, which proved crippling to the French economy and ensured no invasion fleet could slip out undetected. The British victories at the Battle of Lagos in August 1759 and the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759 ended any realistic chance of a major invasion of the British Isles.

As well as securing home defence, Anson co-ordinated with William Pitt a series of British attacks on French colonies around the globe. By 1760 the British had captured Canada, Senegal and Guadeloupe from the French, and followed it up by capturing Belle Île and Dominica in 1761. In 1762 the entry of Spain into the war offered further chances for British expeditions. Anson was the architect of a plan to seize Manila in the Philippines and, using the idea and plans of Admiral Sir Charles Knowles to capture Havana. Anson had been concerned that the combined strength of the French and Spanish navies would overpower Britain, but he still threw himself into the task of directing these expeditions. The British also captured Martinique and Grenada in the French West Indies. Anson was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 30 July 1761. His last service was to convey Queen Charlotte to England.

He died at Moor Park in Hertfordshire on 6 June 1762 and was buried at St Michael and All Angels’ Church in Colwich, Staffordshire. Places named after him include Anson County, North Carolina and Anson, Maine. Eight warships of the Royal Navy have also been named after him.

Anson was a prominent figure in Britain throughout his life, having earned nicknames such as &quot;Father of the British Navy&quot; and accomplishing a wide range of arduous tasks throughout his career, but in the last decades of his life, his fame waned.

==Family==
In April 1748, Anson married Lady Elizabeth Yorke, daughter of Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke; they had no children.

<text>Nahf (, &quot;Naḥf&quot; or &quot;Nahef&quot;; ) is an Arab town in the Northern District of Israel. It is located in between the lower and upper Galilee, about east of Acre. In it had a population of . Archaeologists believe that the area was an important center for viticulture in the Hellenistic period and possibly the Early Bronze Age IB period (ca. 3100 BC).

==History==
Remains have been found from Early Bronze IB, EB II, Middle Bronze Age II and Iron Age II, as well as coins from the Ptolemaic dynasty and Antiochus III. Tombs from the 2nd to the 4th centuries have been found. Nahf contains Persian, Hellenistic and Roman remains.

From archaeological finds, it is assumed that blown glass vessels were produced in the village during the Byzantine era. A bath, containing a hypocaust from the same period has also been excavated. Dating from the late Byzantine era, it was in continuous use in the early Umayyad era.

In the Crusader era it was known as &quot;Nef.&quot; In 1249 John Aleman transferred land, including the casalia of Beit Jann, Sajur, Majd al-Krum and Nahf to the Teutonic Knights.

Remains, including potsherds of bowls, plates and jars, all from Mamluk era, (fourteenth–fifteenth centuries CE), have been found in archaeological excavations.

===Ottoman era===
In 1517, the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596, &quot;Nahaf&quot; appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Akka, part of Sanjak Safad. It had a population of 108 households and 9 bachelors, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, summer crops, fruit trees, goats and/or beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 6,629 akçe.

A map from 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as &quot;Nafeh&quot;. When Victor Guérin visited Nahf in 1875, he described the village as containing 400 Muslims and some Greek Orthodox families, while in 1881 Nahf was described as a village of 200 Muslims living in houses built of stone surrounded by olive groves and arable land.

A population list from 1887 showed that Nahf had about 475 inhabitants; all Muslims.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Nahf had a population of 818, 2 Jews, 6 Christians and 810 Muslims. where all the Christians were Orthodox. At the time of the 1931 census the population had increased to 994, all Muslims, in 194 houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Nahf was 1,320, all Muslims, who owned 15,745 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 1,088 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 4,571 used for cereals, while 44 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===State of Israel===

Nahf was captured by Israel on 18 July 1948 during Operation Dekel led by the Sheva (Seventh) Brigade. Its defenders included the town&#x27;s local militia as well as Arab Liberation Army volunteers. The town was left intact and most residents did not flee their homes. According to Benny Morris, Israeli troops may have used undue force to compel residents to hand over weapons, which sparked an irate response from the military commander who said those who committed such acts would be prosecuted and punished. The population remained under Martial Law until 1966.

In and around Nahf, there are a number of archaeological remains dating from the Middle Ages, including mosaics and a cemetery. In a nearby location lies the shrines of Muslim leaders Sheik Muhammad Rabiah and Sheik Mahmud who fought against the Crusaders. The Auba cave, which dates from the time of the Assyrians, is also located here.

==Notable structures==
The largest medieval structure in the village is a roughly 10 meter long wall, made of large drafted blocks with a rubble core, which may be of Crusader origin.

The Maqam (shrine) of Shaykh Rabi is located on a steep hill above the village, surrounded by a cemetery. It is a domed rectangular building, with an entrance from the east. A deep &quot;mihrab&quot; (&quot;Islamic prayer niche&quot;) is located inside, in the middle of the south side. By the north wall is the elongated cenotaph of Shaykh Rabi.

<text>In economics, resource allocation is the assignment of available resources to various uses. In the context of an entire economy, resources can be allocated by various means, such as markets, or planning.

In project management, resource allocation or resource management is the scheduling of activities and the resources required by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.

==Economics==

In economics, the field of public finance deals with three broad areas: macroeconomic stabilization, the distribution of income and wealth, and the allocation of resources. Much of the study of the allocation of resources is devoted to finding the conditions under which particular mechanisms of resource allocation lead to Pareto efficient outcomes, in which no party&#x27;s situation can be improved without hurting that of another party.

==Strategic planning==
In strategic planning, resource allocation is a plan for using available resources, for example human resources, especially in the near term, to achieve goals for the future. It is the process of allocating scarce resources among the various projects or business units.
There are a number of approaches to solving resource allocation problems e.g. resources can be allocated using a manual approach, an algorithmic approach (see below), or a combination of both.

There may be contingency mechanisms such as a priority ranking of items excluded from the plan, showing which items to fund if more resources should become available and a priority ranking of some items included in the plan, showing which items should be sacrificed if total funding must be reduced.

==Algorithms==
Resource allocation may be decided by using computer programs applied to a specific domain to automatically and dynamically distribute resources to applicants.

This is especially common in electronic devices dedicated to routing and communication. For example, channel allocation in wireless communication may be decided by a base transceiver station using an appropriate algorithm.

One class of resource whereby applicants bid for the best resource(s) according to their balance of &quot;money&quot;, as in an online auction business model (see also auction theory).

In one paper on CPU time slice allocation
an auction algorithm is compared to proportional share scheduling.

<text>al-Nahr (), was a Palestinian village northeast of Acre. It was depopulated in May 1948 after a military assault carried out by the Carmeli Brigade as part of the Israel Defense Forces&#x27;s Operation Ben-Ami. Immediately after the assault, the village of al-Nahr was razed.

==History==
The twin villages of al-Nahr and nearby al-Tall were both sites of ancient settlements atop the tel of Kabri. Recent excavations indicate habitation back to the sixth millennium BC.

===Ottoman era===
In the Ottoman period, the village appeared under the name of &quot;El Qahweh&quot; in Pierre Jacotin´s map from 1799.
In 1875, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he called &quot;El Kahoueh&quot;. He found it to have 120 inhabitants, all Muslims.

In 1881 the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described the village, then named &quot;El Kahweh&quot;, as a &quot;stone village, containing about 250 Moslems, [] situated on the plain, surrounded by figs, olives, mulberries, and pomegranates; there is a spring and flowing stream at this village.&quot;

A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;el Kahweh&quot; had 370 inhabitant; all Muslims.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Al Nahr wa Tal had a population of 422; 3 Bahai, the rest Muslim. In the 1931 census, Al-Nahr had 522 Muslim inhabitants, in a total of 120 houses.

In villagers of Al-Nahr lived principally of agriculture and animal husbandry. In the 1945 statistics it had a population of 610 Muslims, with 5,261 dunams of land. A total of 2,066 dunums was used for citrus and bananas, 1,094 dunums were allotted to cereals, 1,937 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, of which 30 dunums were planted in olive trees, while 28 dunams were built-up land.

====1948 war====

On March 27, 1948, hundreds of armed villagers and units of the Arab Liberation Army attacked a Jewish convoy near Kabri, killing forty-nine Jews. Six Arabs were also killed in the battle. Two months later the commander of Operation Ben-Ami gave operational orders given that day were to &quot;attack with the aim of capturing, the villages of Kabri, Umm al Faraj and Al-Nahr, to kill the men [and] to destroy and set fire to the villages.&quot; Benvenisti states that &quot;the orders were carried out to the letter&quot;, while Morris writes that a number of villagers were apparently executed.

===Israeli period===
Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The kibbutz of Kabri was founded the following year and uses land that had belonged to al-Nahr. The moshav Ben Ami, named after the fallen commander of an attack on nearby Nahariyya, was also established on the village&#x27;s land. In 1992, the village site was described as &quot;Only two houses remain, and one of them is partially destroyed. A tall date-palm tree grows on the village site, which is overgrown by wild grasses, a few cactuses, and fig trees. The cemetery, on the western side of the village contains one identifiable grave. The nearby Fawwara spring has been fenced in and declared private property.&quot;

<text>Al-Ruways (), was a Palestinian Arab village on a rocky hill located southeast of Acre and south of the village of al-Damun. Its population in 1945 was 330. Al-Ruways was depopulated following its capture by Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
Al-Ruways stood on the site of the Crusader town of Careblier, which was also referred to by the Crusaders as Roeis. In 1220, Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Count Otto von Botenlauben, Henneberg, sold their land, including Roeis’, to the Teutonic Knights. However, they appeared not to have sole ownership, as in 1253 John Aleman, Lord of Caesarea, sold several villages, including Roeis, to the Knights Hospitaller. In 1266, a Crusader vanguard returning from a raid in Tiberias to Acre was ambushed at Roeis by Mamluk forces based in Safad. In 1283 it was mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders in the &quot;hudna&quot; (truce) between the Acre-based Crusaders and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur Qalawun.

Based on tradition, the people of the village professed to have blood relations with Husam ad-Din Abu al-Hija. Hussam ad-Din was a high-ranking officer in the Ayyubid army of Sultan Saladin.

===Ottoman era===
French explorer Victor Guérin visited al-Ruways in 1875, and noted that the village contained &quot;150 people at most, whose homes are located on a hill, amid gardens filled with fig, pomegranate and olive trees, and here and there are palm trees&quot;.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described al-Ruways as being situated on open ground with olive groves to the north of the village. Its population of 400 was entirely Muslim.

A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;Ruweis&quot; had about 190 inhabitants; all Muslims.

===British Mandate era===
Under the British Mandate of Palestine in the early twentieth century, al-Ruways was one of the smallest villages in the District of Acre. In the 1922 census Al-Ruways had a population of 154; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 217, still all Muslim, in a total of 44 houses. and consisting of two quarters.

The village had a mosque. Its children attended school in nearby al-Damun. The inhabitants&#x27; drinking water came from domestic wells, and they primarily grew wheat, corn, sesame, watermelons, and olives.

In the 1945 statistics the population of al-Ruways was 330 Muslims, who owned 1,163 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 222 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 844 used for cereals, while built-up areas consisted of 15 dunams.

===Israeli rule===
On 18 July 1948, two days after Nazareth was occupied by Israel&#x27;s Seventh Armored Brigade in Operation Dekel, some units advanced into the Western Galilee and captured a number of Arab villages, one of which was al-Ruways. The inhabitants fled after bombardment and the fall of major towns in the vicinity, namely Shefa-&#x27;Amr and Nazareth. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, &quot;the site is deserted. The debris of old wells and cement roofs is strewn of over the site, which is otherwise covered by a forest of eucalyptus trees and cactus.&quot; By 1992 there were no villages on al-Ruways land, but the surrounding area was cultivated by residents of kibbutz Yas&#x27;ur.

<text>Ishwa&#x27; () was a Palestinian village which was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The village was located about 20 km west of Jerusalem, on the present location of Eshta&#x27;ol. In the 1931 British census of Palestine, Ishwa had a population of 468 in 126 houses. The village was occupied by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on July 16, 1948, in Operation Dani by the Harel Brigade. All of its inhabitants fled or were expelled.

==History==
Ishwa was an ancient village, situated at the foot of a hill.

It is thought to have been established over the site of the Israelite city of Eshtaol, famous for the biblical story of Samson. It was known by that name during the Roman Empire era, when it fell within the administrative district of Eleutheropolis (Bayt Jibrin). However, Dayr Abu al-Qabus, located to the north has also been identified with Eshta&#x27;ol.

===Ottoman era===
During the 16th century CE, settlement seems to have shifted to the northwest to Islin. During the 17th or 18th century the site of Islin went out of use, and Ishwa was probably repopulated.

In 1863 the French explorer Victor Guérin visited and found the village to have barely 300 inhabitants. The only ancient remains was a ruined arch near the well, which he thought was possibly dated to the Roman period. An Ottoman village list of about 1870 counted 32 houses and a population of 90 in &quot;Schu’a&quot;, though the population count included men, only. It was described as being in the Hebron district, just east of Sar&#x27;a.

By 1875, it had a population of 450. In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described it as being built near the foot of a hill and with olive trees planted below the village. Ishwa had a star-shaped configuration, its mostly stone houses extending along the roads leading to other villages.

In 1896 the population of &quot;Aschuwa&quot;&#x27; was estimated to be about 354 persons.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Ishwa had a population of 379, all Muslim. This had increased by the time of the 1931 census to 468, still all Muslim, in 117 houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population was 620, all Muslims while the total land area was 5,522 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 473 were allocated for plantations and irrigable land, 1,911 for cereals, while 47 dunams were classified as built-up areas.

===1948 Arab–Israeli War and aftermath===
Ishwa, along with four other villages, were overtaken by the Israeli Harel Brigade on 17–18 July 1948 in Operation Dani. The villages had been on the front line since April 1948 and most of the inhabitants of these villages had already left the area. Many of those who stayed fled when Israeli forces attacked and the few who remained at each village were expelled.

Following the war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. In 1949 the moshav of Eshtaol was established on land that had belonged to Ishwa and nearby Islin. 

In 1992 Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi noted that: &quot;Only a few of the village houses remain on the site, interspersed among the settlement&#x27;s houses; some serve as residences and warehouses. The village cemetery, next to the administrative building of the settlement, has been levelled and planted with grass. On the southern edge of the cemetery is a cave that contains the large grindstone of a flour mill. Olive and carob trees grow on the site, among other trees more recently planted by the settlers. At the western edge of the village is a soccer field. The walls and fallen roofs of the destroyed houses can be seen at the edge of this field.&quot;
In 1998, a book about the village was published in Jordan.

<text>Carbon paper (originally carbonic paper) consists of sheets of paper that create one or more copies simultaneously with the creation of an original document when inscribed by a typewriter or ballpoint pen. The email term cc which means ‘carbon copy’ is derived from this use of carbon paper.

== History ==
In 1801, Pellegrino Turri, an Italian inventor, invented carbon paper to provide the ink for his mechanical typing machine, one of the first typewriters. Ralph Wedgwood obtained the first patent for carbon paper in 1806.

Carbon paper in its original form was paper coated on one side with a layer of a loosely bound dry ink or pigmented coating, bound with wax. The manufacture of carbon paper was formerly the largest consumer of montan wax. In 1954 the Columbia Ribbon &amp; Carbon Manufacturing Company filed a patent for what became known in the trade as solvent carbon paper: the coating was changed from wax-based to polymer-based. The manufacturing process changed from a hot-melt method to a solvent-applied coating or set of coatings. It was then possible to use polyester or other plastic film as a substrate, instead of paper, although the name remained carbon paper.

Carbon paper was the principal medium of reproduction for samizdat, a publication method used in the former Soviet Union in order to publish books without having to use state-controlled printing houses and risk the censorship or imprisonment.

== Modern uses ==

The advent of word processing and the decline of typewriting meant that any number of copies of a document could be printed on demand, and the decline of carbon paper, which had already been partially superseded by photocopying and carbonless copy paper, became irrevocable. A few specialist or remnant uses remain. Examples of these are receipts at point of sale (though they have mostly been relegated to being backups for when electronic POS devices fail) or for on-the-spot fine notices, duplicate checks, and some money orders (though the United States Postal Service has recently converted to an electronic format), and tracking slips for various expedited mail services requiring multiple copies. In India, form-filling is on a sufficient scale that carbon paper is still widely used. As of 2013, in Canada, only one eight-person company still manufactured carbon paper; in the United Kingdom, one company; and in the United States, only two small companies.

There have been some experimental uses of carbon paper in art: as a surface for painting and mail art (to decorate envelopes). Carbon paper is commonly used to transfer patterns onto glass in the creation of stained glass.

Carbon paper disks are still used in school physics labs as part of experiments on projectile motion and position.

== Fuel cell &quot;carbon paper&quot; ==

A substance known as &quot;carbon paper&quot; is also used in fuel cell applications. However, this carbon paper has nothing to do with the carbon paper used for copying texts. It consists of carbon microfibers manufactured into flat sheets. It is used to help as an electrode that facilitates diffusion of reagents across the catalyst layered membrane portion of membrane electrode assembly.

<doc id="267444" wikidata="Q260928" url="?curid=267444" title="Jordan curve theorem">
<text>In topology, the Jordan curve theorem (JCT), formulated by Camille Jordan in 1887, asserts that every &quot;Jordan curve&quot; (a plane simple closed curve) divides the plane into an &quot;interior&quot; region bounded by the curve (not to be confused with the interior of a set) and an &quot;exterior&quot; region containing all of the nearby and far away exterior points. Every continuous path connecting a point of one region to a point of the other intersects with the curve somewhere. 

While the theorem seems intuitively obvious, it takes some ingenuity to prove it by elementary means. &quot;Although the JCT is one of the best known topological theorems, there are many, even among professional mathematicians, who have never read a proof of it.&quot; (). More transparent proofs rely on the mathematical machinery of algebraic topology, and these lead to generalizations to higher-dimensional spaces.

The Jordan curve theorem is named after the mathematician Camille Jordan (1838–1922), who published its first claimed proof in 1887. For decades, mathematicians generally thought that this proof was flawed and that the first rigorous proof was carried out by Oswald Veblen. However, this notion has been overturned by Thomas C. Hales and others.

== Definitions and the statement of the Jordan theorem ==

A &quot;Jordan curve&quot; or a &quot;simple closed curve&quot; in the plane formula_1 is the image formula_2 of an injective continuous map of a circle into the plane, formula_3. A Jordan arc in the plane is the image of an injective continuous map of a closed and bounded interval formula_4 into the plane. It is a plane curve that is not necessarily smooth nor algebraic.

Alternatively, a Jordan curve is the image of a continuous map formula_5 such that formula_6 and the restriction of formula_7 to formula_8 is injective. The first two conditions say that formula_2 is a continuous loop, whereas the last condition stipulates that formula_2 has no self-intersection points.

With these definitions, the Jordan curve theorem can be stated as follows:

In contrast, the complement of a Jordan &quot;arc&quot; in the plane is connected.

== Proof and generalizations ==

The Jordan curve theorem was independently generalized to higher dimensions by H. Lebesgue and L. E. J. Brouwer in 1911, resulting in the Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem.

The proof uses homology theory. It is first established that, more generally, if &quot;X&quot; is homeomorphic to the &quot;k&quot;-sphere, then the reduced integral homology groups of &quot;Y&quot; = R&quot;n&quot;+1 \ &quot;X&quot; are as follows:

: formula_11

This is proved by induction in &quot;k&quot; using the Mayer–Vietoris sequence. When &quot;n&quot; = &quot;k&quot;, the zeroth reduced homology of &quot;Y&quot; has rank 1, which means that &quot;Y&quot; has 2 connected components (which are, moreover, path connected), and with a bit of extra work, one shows that their common boundary is &quot;X&quot;. A further generalization was found by J. W. Alexander, who established the Alexander duality between the reduced homology of a compact subset &quot;X&quot; of R&quot;n&quot;+1 and the reduced cohomology of its complement. If &quot;X&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional compact connected submanifold of R&quot;n&quot;+1 (or S&quot;n&quot;+1) without boundary, its complement has 2 connected components.

There is a strengthening of the Jordan curve theorem, called the Jordan–Schönflies theorem, which states that the interior and the exterior planar regions determined by a Jordan curve in R2 are homeomorphic to the interior and exterior of the unit disk. In particular, for any point &quot;P&quot; in the interior region and a point &quot;A&quot; on the Jordan curve, there exists a Jordan arc connecting &quot;P&quot; with &quot;A&quot; and, with the exception of the endpoint &quot;A&quot;, completely lying in the interior region. An alternative and equivalent formulation of the Jordan–Schönflies theorem asserts that any Jordan curve &quot;φ&quot;: &quot;S&quot;1 → R2, where &quot;S&quot;1 is viewed as the unit circle in the plane, can be extended to a homeomorphism &quot;ψ&quot;: R2 → R2 of the plane. Unlike Lebesgue&#x27;s and Brouwer&#x27;s generalization of the Jordan curve theorem, this statement becomes &quot;false&quot; in higher dimensions: while the exterior of the unit ball in R3 is simply connected, because it retracts onto the unit sphere, the Alexander horned sphere is a subset of R3 homeomorphic to a sphere, but so twisted in space that the unbounded component of its complement in R3 is not simply connected, and hence not homeomorphic to the exterior of the unit ball.

=== Discrete version ===
The Jordan curve theorem can be proved from the Brouwer fixed point theorem (in 2 dimensions), and the Brouwer fixed point theorem can be proved from the Hex theorem: &quot;every game of Hex has at least one winner&quot;, from which we obtain a logical implication: Hex theorem implies Brouwer fixed point theorem, which implies Jordan curve theorem.

It is clear that Jordan curve theorem implies the &quot;strong Hex theorem&quot;: &quot;every game of Hex ends with exactly one winner, with no possibility of both sides losing or both sides winning&quot;, thus the Jordan curve theorem is equivalent to the strong Hex theorem, which is a purely discrete theorem.

The Brouwer fixed point theorem, by being sandwiched between the two equivalent theorems, is also equivalent to both.

In reverse mathematics, and computer-formalized mathematics, the Jordan curve theorem is commonly proved by first converting it to an equivalent discrete version similar to the strong Hex theorem, then proving the discrete version.

==== Application to image processing ====
In image processing, a binary picture is a discrete square grid of 0 and 1, or equivalently, a compact subset of formula_12. Topological invariants on formula_13, such as number of components, might fail to be well-defined for formula_12 if formula_12 does not have an appropriately defined graph structure.

There are two obvious graph structures on formula_12: 

* the &quot;4-neighbor square grid&quot;, where each vertex formula_17 is connected with formula_18.
* the &quot;8-neighbor square grid&quot;, where each vertex formula_17 is connected with formula_20 iff formula_21, and formula_22.

Both graph structures fail to satisfy the strong Hex theorem. The 4-neighbor square grid allows a no-winner situation, and the 8-neighbor square grid allows a two-winner situation. Consequently, connectedness properties in formula_13, such as the Jordan curve theorem, do not generalize to formula_12 under either graph structure.

If the &quot;6-neighbor square grid&quot; structure is imposed on formula_12, then it is the hexagonal grid, and thus satisfies the strong Hex theorem, allowing the Jordan curve theorem to generalize. For this reason, when computing connected components in a binary image, the 6-neighbor square grid is generally used.

==== Steinhaus chessboard theorem ====
The Steinhaus chessboard theorem in some sense shows that the 4-neighbor grid and the 8-neighbor grid &quot;together&quot; implies the Jordan curve theorem, and the 6-neighbor grid is a precise interpolation between them.

The theorem states that: suppose you put bombs on some squares on a formula_26 chessboard, so that a king cannot move from the bottom side to the top side without stepping on a bomb, then a rook can move from the left side to the right side stepping only on bombs.

== History and further proofs ==

The statement of the Jordan curve theorem may seem obvious at first, but it is a rather difficult theorem to prove. Bernard Bolzano was the first to formulate a precise conjecture, observing that it was not a self-evident statement, but that it required a proof.
It is easy to establish this result for polygons, but the problem came in generalizing it to all kinds of badly behaved curves, which include nowhere differentiable curves, such as the Koch snowflake and other fractal curves, or even a Jordan curve of positive area constructed by .

The first proof of this theorem was given by Camille Jordan in his lectures on real analysis, and was published in his book &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse de l&#x27;École Polytechnique&quot;. There is some controversy about whether Jordan&#x27;s proof was complete: the majority of commenters on it have claimed that the first complete proof was given later by Oswald Veblen, who said the following about Jordan&#x27;s proof:

His proof, however, is unsatisfactory to many mathematicians. It assumes the theorem without proof in the important special case of a simple polygon, and of the argument from that point on, one must admit at least that all details are not given.

However, Thomas C. Hales wrote:

Nearly every modern citation that I have found agrees that the first correct proof is due to Veblen... In view of the heavy criticism of Jordan’s proof, I was surprised when I sat down to read his proof to find nothing objectionable about it. Since then, I have contacted a number of the authors who have criticized Jordan, and each case the author has admitted to having no direct knowledge of an error in Jordan’s proof.

Hales also pointed out that the special case of simple polygons is not only an easy exercise, but was not really used by Jordan anyway, and quoted Michael Reeken as saying:
Jordan’s proof is essentially correct... Jordan’s proof does not present the details in a satisfactory way. But the idea is right, and with some polishing the proof would be impeccable.

Earlier, Jordan&#x27;s proof and another early proof by Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin had already been critically analyzed and completed by Schoenflies (1924).

Due to the importance of the Jordan curve theorem in low-dimensional topology and complex analysis, it received much attention from prominent mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century. Various proofs of the theorem and its generalizations were constructed by J. W. Alexander, Louis Antoine, Ludwig Bieberbach, Luitzen Brouwer, Arnaud Denjoy, Friedrich Hartogs, Béla Kerékjártó, Alfred Pringsheim, and Arthur Moritz Schoenflies.

New elementary proofs of the Jordan curve theorem, as well as simplifications of the earlier proofs, continue to be carried out.

* Elementary proofs were presented by and .
* A proof using non-standard analysis by .
* A proof using constructive mathematics by .
* A proof using the Brouwer fixed point theorem by .
* A proof using non-planarity of the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;3,3 was given by .

The root of the difficulty is explained in as follows. It is relatively simple to prove that the Jordan curve theorem holds for every Jordan polygon (Lemma 1), and every Jordan curve can be approximated arbitrarily well by a Jordan polygon (Lemma 2). A Jordan polygon is a polygonal chain, the boundary of a bounded connected open set, call it the open polygon, and its closure, the closed polygon. Consider the diameter formula_27 of the largest disk contained in the closed polygon. Evidently, formula_27 is positive. Using a sequence of Jordan polygons (that converge to the given Jordan curve) we have a sequence formula_29 &quot;presumably&quot; converging to a positive number, the diameter formula_27 of the largest disk contained in the closed region bounded by the Jordan curve. However, we have to &quot;prove&quot; that the sequence formula_29 does not converge to zero, using only the given Jordan curve, not the region &quot;presumably&quot; bounded by the curve. This is the point of Tverberg&#x27;s Lemma 3. Roughly, the closed polygons should not thin to zero everywhere. Moreover, they should not thin to zero somewhere, which is the point of Tverberg&#x27;s Lemma 4.

The first formal proof of the Jordan curve theorem was created by in the HOL Light system, in January 2005, and contained about 60,000 lines. Another rigorous 6,500-line formal proof was produced in 2005 by an international team of mathematicians using the Mizar system. Both the Mizar and the HOL Light proof rely on libraries of previously proved theorems, so these two sizes are not comparable. showed that in reverse mathematics the Jordan curve theorem is equivalent to weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma over the system formula_32.

== Application ==
In computational geometry, the Jordan curve theorem can be used for testing whether a point lies inside or outside a simple polygon.

From a given point, trace a ray that does not pass through any vertex of the polygon (all rays but a finite number are convenient). Then, compute the number of intersections of the ray with an edge of the polygon. Jordan curve theorem proof implies that the point is inside the polygon if and only if is odd.

== Computational aspects ==
Adler, Daskalakis and Demaine prove that a computational version of Jordan&#x27;s theorem is PPAD-complete. As a corollary, they show that Jordan&#x27;s theorem implies the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. This complements the earlier result by Maehara, that Brouwer&#x27;s fixed point theorem implies Jordan&#x27;s theorem.

<text>Khirbat al-Jawfa&#x27; was a Palestinian Arab village that was depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war.

==Location==
The village was situated west of Jenin, on the top of a small circular plateau that extended from the northern slope of a mountain (Jabal Faqqu&#x27;a). It overlooked the Jordan Valley to the north and northeast, and was linked by a dirt path to the village Tall al-Shawk in District of Baysan.

==History==
===British period===
In the British mandate period the village was classified as a hamlet by the &quot;Palestine Index Gazetteer&quot;.

It was probably occupied by the forces of the Golani Brigade as part of Operation Gideon on 12 May 1948. Most of its population fled to Jenin and its surrounding areas after the Israeli forces overtook the city of Bisan on 15 May 1948.

===Israeli period===
According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the 1948 armistice line separating Israel from the West Bank fell a short distance to the west of Khirbat al-Jawfa, cutting through the land of the nearby village of Faqqu&#x27;a (in the West Bank). The land of this village that was inside Israel have been combined with the land that belonged to Khirbat al-Jawfa, making the two indistinguishable. The kibbutz of Ma&#x27;ale Gilboa, founded 1962, is located inside this amalgamated parcel of land, southwest of the village site.

Khalidi described the village remaining structures in 1992 as: &quot;Although sections of some walls still stand, most of the former houses have been reduced to rubble. The entire area has been fenced in and is used as a grazing area for cows. A large water tank belonging to kibbutz Ma&#x27;ale Gilbo&#x27;a is on the site&quot;.

<text>Apple Daily () was a Chinese-language pro-democracy newspaper published in Hong Kong from 1995 to 2021. Founded by Jimmy Lai and part of Next Media, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; was known for its sensational headlines, paparazzi photographs, and pro-democracy, anti-CCP editorial position&quot;.&quot; A sister publication of the same name was published in Taiwan under a joint venture between Next Digital and other Taiwanese companies.

In a Reuters Institute poll conducted in early 2021, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; was the fourth most-used offline source of news in Hong Kong, while its website was the second most-used among online news media in the city. According to a survey conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; was the third most trusted paid newspaper in 2019.

&quot;Apple Daily&quot;″s editorial position favoring the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong made it a subject of advertising boycotts and political pressure. After the controversial Hong Kong national security law was enacted, police raided its headquarters on 10 August 2020, a police operation criticized by some democratic governments and press rights groups.

On 17 June 2021, Hong Kong authorities used the Hong Kong national security law to freeze the assets of the company and Jimmy Lai. This move was widely described as an attack on press freedom. As a result of the asset freeze, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; was unable to pay wages and electricity bills, and had to cease operations. The final print edition was published on 24 June, with over a million copies being printed, up from the usual 80,000, and the newspaper&#x27;s supporters lined up in queues stretching hundreds of meters in order to buy them. The newspaper&#x27;s main and supplementary YouTube channel, &quot;Fruit Seed&quot;, also shut down at midnight on the same day.

== History ==
&quot;Apple Daily&quot; was founded on 20 June 1995 by garment businessman Jimmy Lai. After the success of &quot;Next Magazine&quot;, another publication owned by Lai, he launched &quot;Apple Daily&quot; with an initial capital of HK$700 thousand ($89,750). Lai, a Catholic himself, named &quot;Apple Daily&quot; after the forbidden fruit, which he said if Adam and Eve did not eat, there would be no evil and no news.

=== Price war ===
The newspaper launched against a poor economy and a competitive Chinese-language newspaper market. Political uncertainties from Lai&#x27;s criticisms of the Chinese government also made media analysts pessimistic about the future of &quot;Apple&quot;. Its launch was teased by television advertisements where Lai was portrayed with an apple on his head, which would have been a shooting target for its competitors. In the first month of publication, the newspaper gave out coupons which effectively reduced the cover price to HK$2 ($0.25), despite a standardised retail price of HK$5 per issue set by the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong. The price was restored to $5 after a month, but the newspaper switched to promotion with T-shirts and coloured posters. The campaign boosted &quot;Apple Daily&quot; to 200,000 copies on its first day, to become the newspaper with the second highest circulation in Hong Kong.

A price war ensued between popular newspapers in response to &quot;Apple Daily&quot;″s entry into the market. &quot;Oriental Daily&quot; dropped its price to $2 from $5 per issue in December 1995. Other newspapers, such as &quot;Sing Pao&quot; and &quot;Tin Tin Daily&quot; followed suit. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; reduced its retail price to $4 one day after &quot;Oriental Daily&quot; announced a 10 per cent drop in its circulation. As a result, a number of newspapers collapsed: &quot;TV Daily&quot; ceased operations on the first day of the price war, &quot;Hong Kong United Daily&quot;, &quot;China Times&quot; magazine, and English newspaper &quot;Eastern Express&quot;, a sister newspaper of &quot;Oriental Daily&quot;, collapsed soon afterwards.

=== Editorial history ===
In March 2015, Chan Pui-man became the first female chief editor of the journal, replacing Ip Yut-kin. In 2019, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; was an award winner of the Hong Kong Human Rights Press Awards for their reporting on Liu Xia, the wife of Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo. In 2020, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; launched the English edition of its digital newspaper. According to the most recent filings prior to its closure, it had a print circulation of over 86,000, and its website had approximately 9.6 million monthly unique visitors in Hong Kong.

The paper became the target of the Hong Kong authorities after its very strong and vocal support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong as well as its xenophobia. Jimmy Lai was arrested in December 2020 and sentenced to jail in April 2021 relating to the 2019–2020 protests. The offices of the paper were raided in 2020, its accounts frozen and five people including its editor Ryan Law and CEO Cheung Kim-hung were arrested in 2021. The paper announced its closure on 23 June 2021.

=== Film feature ===
&quot;Apple Daily&quot; was prominently featured in the 2022 film &quot;The Hong Konger&quot; produced by American think tank Acton Institute. The film had a positive reception and showcased the final days of Apple Daily&#x27;s operations before being shut down due to the Hong Kong national security law.

== Content ==
The newspaper was modelled after &quot;USA Today&quot;, with printing in full colour and concise writing. It also extensively used written Cantonese, when most Hong Kong newspapers used written vernacular Chinese, and a focus on reporting crime, celebrity news, eroticism, gambling, and drug use. It carried at least three pages of entertainment news at the beginning but this was increased to eight pages by 2000.

&quot;Apple Daily&quot; is described to have introduced tabloid journalism to the Hong Kong market. The focus on large colourful graphics and more sensationalist stories, such as celebrity scandals, racist targeting of mainland immigrants, traffic accidents and deaths, quickly made &quot;Apple Daily&quot; Hong Kong&#x27;s second most popular newspaper. This type of journalism has also been replicated by other newspapers in Hong Kong.

&quot;Apple Daily&quot; attracted public criticism in 1998 for a report about a woman who jumped off a building after pushing her children out the window. The woman&#x27;s husband was widely reported to have little remorse for the deaths of his wife and children. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; published a photo of the man with two prostitutes soon after the deaths. It was then revealed that the newspaper had paid the man to pose for the photograph, for which &quot;Apple Daily&quot; issued an apology after public outcry. In the same year, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; ran a front-page article claiming that lawyer Jessie Chu Siu Kuk-yuen absconded with more than of clients&#x27; money for her law firm. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; was ordered by a court to pay Chu more than in damages for defamation. In 2000, an &quot;Apple Daily&quot; reporter was sentenced to 10 months in jail for bribing police officers for information on criminal cases.

Journalism scholar Paul Lee said the establishment of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; has changed the Hong Kong newspaper ecosystem by transforming broadsheet newspapers into tabloids. Lee said newspapers with a high circulation, such as &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;Oriental Daily&quot;, are known for their tabloid journalism as well as making mainstream reporting (see middle-market newspaper). &quot;Apple Daily&quot; did not join the self-regulation panel of the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong.

&quot;Apple Daily&quot; is also known for its coverage of breaking news and current affairs in Hong Kong and China. The newspaper had exclusive reports on political scandals, including member of the Legislative Council Cheng Kai-nam not reporting conflict of interest in 2000, and former Financial Secretary Antony Leung for avoiding tax when purchasing a car.

=== Editorial position ===
&quot;Apple Daily&quot; favoured the Hong Kong pro-democracy camp. Its criticism of the Hong Kong government has been described as a marketing strategy. According to Fung (2007), the newspaper is also said to have sensationalised politics and produced public dissent. In 2003, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; was critical of the second Tung Chee-hwa administration, encouraging readers to participate in pro-democracy demonstrations with its front-page headline. It launched a social media campaign in support of students in the 2014 Hong Kong protests and its social media presence was considered a mainstream pro-activist community. 

Critical of the Chinese government, it was the only newspaper in Hong Kong that expressed optimism when Chen Shui-bian was re-elected President of the Republic of China in 2004.

The editorial position against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments has resulted in advertising boycotts. In 2003, several major property developers in Hong Kong ended their advertisements in the newspaper. According to Mark Simon, an executive of Next Digital, HSBC, Hang Seng and Standard Chartered stopped advertising in the newspaper in 2013 due to pressure from the Chinese government&#x27;s Liaison Office. However, the Liaison Office denied it had contacted the banks, and the banks said they pulled advertising for commercial reasons.

&quot;Apple Daily&quot; also said Chinese-sponsored hackers have attacked it almost every week. FireEye said in 2014 that denial-of-service attacks on &quot;Apple Daily&quot; were professional cyberattacks that may have been coordinated by the Chinese government.

===2020 US presidential election misinformation===

The newspaper inclined toward pro-Donald Trump misinformation during the 2020 United States presidential election, which was believed to relate to the former and current president&#x27;s anti-Chinese xenophobia. In an opinion piece, it falsely claimed that &quot;a vote for Trump is not only for the Americans&#x27; own interests, but it is also one that is for the survival of the free world&quot;; in another commentary, it misleadingly criticized the Democratic Party and a &quot;leftist ideology permeated in Western academia and journalism&quot;. Although the position of the newspaper and Jimmy Lai was echoed by many democracy activists in Hong Kong, Taiwan and exiled Chinese dissidents living in the United States, democracy experts in the US like University of Kentucky professor Sharon Yam and Los Angeles-based AAPI activist and writer Promise Li considered these views problematic for the pro-democracy movement and agreed that they not only benefitted the mainland Chinese government, but were also instrumental in the organization of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

In September and October 2020, the newspaper published a factually inaccurate 64-page report produced by Typhoon Investigations untruthfully alleging Hunter Biden had a &quot;problematic&quot; connection with the Chinese Communist Party, which was widely cited by far-right influencers such as Steve Bannon and fellow anti-China activist Guo Wengui. A report by NBC linked the Typhoon Investigations to a fake &quot;intelligence firm&quot; and claimed that the author of the document, a self-identified Swiss security analyst named Martin Aspen, was a &quot;fabricated identity&quot;. The original poster of the document, Christopher Balding, admitted that he wrote parts of the document and later stated that the document had been commissioned by &quot;Apple Daily&quot;. Jimmy Lai later said that he had personally &quot;nothing to do with&quot; the report, but he admitted his senior executive, Mark Simon, had &quot;worked with the project&quot;. Simon resigned following the NBC report and apologised for having &quot;allowed damage to Jimmy on a matter he was completely in the dark on&quot;.

== 2020 national security law raid ==
The Hong Kong offices of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; were raided by over 200 national security officers on 10 August 2020, following the arrest of Lai the previous day for violations of the recently implemented national security law. Lai&#x27;s two sons, four senior executives of Next Digital and three social activists, were also arrested on the same day. The arrests, coming amid Beijing&#x27;s ongoing crackdown against many pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong, drew condemnation from international governments and human rights groups. Lai and other arrestees reportedly faced charges of &quot;foreign collusion&quot;, which included advocating for foreign sanctions, based on the broad definitions of the national security law. Earlier in the week, the United States had placed sanctions on 11 high-profile Hong Kong officials involved in the city&#x27;s democratic suppression.

The police raid lasted nine hours, as the officers rifled through the business property and carted off 25 boxes of documents. The police search warrant did not disclose what they were looking for in the headquarters. The police also brought Lai into the office for two and a half hours and paraded him through the newsroom in handcuffs, an act possibly aimed at humiliating Lai and to silence the press.

The raid was live streamed by &quot;Apple&quot; reporters. The streaming footage included a tense moment when the policed shoved an editor for questioning the boundaries of the search. The police ordered for the live broadcast to be stopped, but the staff member continued filming the raid, arguing press freedom.

Next Digital released a statement condemning the police raid and declared, &quot;Hong Kong&#x27;s press freedom is now hanging by a thread, but our staff will remain fully committed to our duty to defend the freedom of the press.&quot;

=== Police conduct ===
Media access was restricted during the raid, with only media sources trusted by the police being allowed. During the police news conferences conducted to provide updates about the search, numerous news outlets including Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, &quot;RTHK&quot; and &quot;Stand News&quot; were barred. The media representatives allowed to remain were denied questions.

During the raid, the Next Media Trade Union protested the police reading through the confidential news materials in the newsroom. Steve Li Kwai-wah, the Senior Superintendent from the new National Security Department, said they searched the area since one of the arrestees had an office on the assigned floor. Li also said the officers only &quot;scanned&quot; the materials to confirm their relevance to the case. Legal scholar Johannes Chan later criticised the move, stating that even a quick scan jeopardised the confidentiality in news reporting.

=== International response ===
International communities responded to &quot;Apple Daily&quot;&#x27;s raid with condemnation, with global organisations highlighting the erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong. Amnesty International spoke against the harassment of journalists, and called for all criminal charges related to the national security law to be dropped. The Asia Chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA-Asia) expressed their support for &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, and urged Hong Kong&#x27;s leaders to uphold the values of free speech. Keith Richburg, a journalism professor at the University of Hong Kong, described the &quot;frightening prospect&quot; for journalists to operate under the national security law. Christophe Deloire, the Secretary General at Reporters Without Borders, said that &quot;the Hong Kong government clearly seeks to take down a symbolic figure of press freedom.&quot;

The Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club (FCC) in Hong Kong was also critical about the police&#x27;s obstruction of news coverage during the raid, raising worries about propaganda in the absence of press freedom. Human Rights Watch stated that the raid on &quot;Apple Daily&quot; may be motivated by a desire to censor an independent Chinese media outlet. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said the national security law was used to &quot;suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom&quot;, and called for Lai&#x27;s immediate release. Activist groups in Taiwan advocated for further international sanctions on Chinese government officials to support the arrestees.

Government officials around the world condemned Lai&#x27;s arrest and the police raid on &quot;Apple Daily&quot;. Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, expressed her disappointment over the continuous erosion of Hong Kong&#x27;s human rights and democracy. Mike Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, said that Beijing eviscerated Hong Kong&#x27;s freedoms. Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, voiced grave concern over Hong Kong&#x27;s situation following the arrests. In contrast, China&#x27;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian approved of the mass arrests on the pro-democracy figures, stating that the Chinese government supported the national security law.

=== Aftermath ===
After the raid, the executives at &quot;Apple Daily&quot; vowed to resume their daily operations. Following a surge of popular demand, &quot;Apple&quot; announced the plan to print 350,000 copies for their Tuesday publication – a significant increase from their daily circulation of 70,000 copies. The print run was later set at 550,000 printed copies. A social media campaign encouraging the public to buy the newspaper was launched, and received backing of activist Joshua Wong, singer Pong Nan, and lawmaker Ted Hui. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; also uploaded a live stream of their print production process.

On 11 August, the Tuesday newspaper was published with the front-page headline declaring, &quot;&quot;Apple Daily&quot; must fight on.&quot; Tsang Chi-ho, the former presenter of satirical news show &quot;Headliner,&quot; included a blank space in his regular column that simply said, &quot;You can&#x27;t kill us all.&quot; Many Hong Kong residents lined up overnight at newspaper vendors to buy the first printed copies. Readers also purchased the newspapers in bulk, distributing free copies around the city. Within hours, multiple convenience stores had sold out all their copies. The high demand came from readers who wanted to show their support towards &quot;Apple Daily&quot; and preserve press freedom in Hong Kong.

On the day of the arrests, Next Digital&#x27;s shares originally fell by 16.7% to a record low of HK$0.075. An online campaign then emerged, which encouraged supporters to purchase stock in the company. Following the campaign, the stock experienced a 1100% gain over the next two days, reaching a record high in the past seven years. On Tuesday, the stock closed at HK$1.10 and became the third highest performer on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that day. On Wednesday, the shares fell over 40% after the Securities and Futures Commission issued a warning about the high volatility. A probe by police into alleged market manipulation led to the arrest of 15 suspects on 10 September 2020.

Lai was released in the early morning of 12 August after 40 hours in detention. Later that day, he arrived at the &quot;Apple Daily&quot; newsroom, and was met with cheers from employees. He urged staff members to fight on, with the support of the Hong Kong people, and not let them down.

==2021 arrests and closure==
The assets of three companies, Apple Daily Limited, Apple Daily Printing Limited, and AD Internet Limited, as well as accounts belonging to Jimmy Lai worth more than HK$500 million, having already been frozen on 14 May 2021, a 500-strong contingent of police officers raided &quot;Apple Daily&quot;″s headquarters on 17 June. They arrested CEO Cheung Kim-hung, COO Royston Chow, chief editor Ryan Law, associate publisher Chan Pui-man and platform director of Apple Daily Digital, Cheung Chi-wai, and charged them on suspicion of violating Article 29 of the national security law, which outlaws collusion with external forces to endanger national security. HK$18m ($2.3m; £1.64m) of the companies&#x27; assets were frozen.

&quot;Apple Daily&quot; warned that press freedom in Hong Kong was &quot;hanging by a thread.&quot;

The raid and arrests were criticised by the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom, as well as the United Nations&#x27; human rights spokesperson. The Chinese central government has rejected the criticism that the national security law was used to suppress press freedom and said external forces should &quot;stop undermining Hong Kong&#x27;s rule of law on the pretext of press freedom&quot;. Supporters in Hong Kong showed support for the newspaper by buying it, which increased its print run to 500,000 the day after the arrests.

On 21 June, the paper announced it would have to close unless the accounts were unfrozen, as it was unable to pay its staff or support operating costs. On 23 June, the newspaper said it would close &quot;in view of staff members&#x27; safety&quot; and the print run of 24 June would be its last. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; also said its digital version would go offline at 23:59 Hong Kong Time (UTC+8) on 23 June.

Activists backed up the news articles from &quot;Apple Daily&quot; on various blockchain platforms to ensure the content was available and free from Chinese censorship.

In 2023, the domain itself was taken over, in a move known as domain squatting, by Serbian entrepreneur Nebojša Vujinović who used the website to post AI-generated clickbait articles on a range of topics, none of them related to the position of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; before the takeover.

Apple editorialist &quot;Li Ping&quot; (Yeung Ching-kei) was arrested on 23 June &quot;on suspicion of conspiring to collude with foreign countries or foreign forces to endanger national security&quot;, Fung Wai-kong, editor-in-chief of the English news section at Apple, was arrested on 27 June at Hong Kong International Airport while attempting to flee the city.
===Reactions===
United States President Joe Biden released a statement that, &quot;It is a sad day for media freedom in Hong Kong and around the world. Intensifying repression by Beijing has reached such a level that &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, a much-needed bastion of independent journalism in Hong Kong, has now ceased publishing. Through arrests, threats, and forcing through a National Security Law that penalizes free speech, Beijing has insisted on wielding its power to suppress independent media and silence dissenting views.&quot; The European Union released a statement that &quot;the National Security Law imposed by Beijing is being used to stifle freedom of the press and the free expression of opinions&quot; and that closure of &quot;Apple&quot; &quot;undermines media freedom and pluralism&quot;, a sentiment also shared by UK foreign minister Dominic Raab. Taiwan similarly called the closure &quot;political oppression&quot; and that it &quot;sounded the death knell for freedom of press, publication, and speech in Hong Kong&quot;. Japanese government spokesperson Katsunobu Kato called the paper&#x27;s closure a &quot;major setback&quot; for freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Hong Kong and voiced grave concerns over the situation. Amnesty International said that the &quot;forced closure of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; is the blackest day for media freedom in Hong Kong&#x27;s recent history&quot;.
Chinese state-owned newspaper &quot;Global Times&quot; described &quot;Apple Daily&quot; as &quot;secessionist&quot; and quoted Chinese commentators as saying that the closure is the &quot;end of an era in which foreign proxies and secessionist forces meddled in China&#x27;s internal affairs&quot;. The Chinese foreign minister said that &quot;no one or no organisation is above the law. All rights and freedom, including media freedom, cannot go beyond the bottom line of national security.&quot; North Korea has condemned &quot;Apple Daily&quot; and has accused foreign countries of foreign interference in Hong Kong.

The final print issue of the paper was met with high demand and sold out, despite a million copies being printed compared to the usual 80,000. Hong Kongers formed long queues and waited for hours to buy the final edition of the paper.

The European Parliament passed a motion by 578 votes to 29, with 73 abstentions, on Thursday, 8 July 2021, condemning &quot;in the strongest terms the recent forced closure of [Apple Daily], the continued freezing of its assets and the arrests of its journalists.&quot; It also demands the Hong Kong government to &quot;stop harassing and intimidating journalists, release arbitrarily detained prisoners, and denounces any attempts to muzzle pro-democracy activists and their activities&quot;. Members of the legislature also urged EU member states to impose sanctions on those officials &quot;responsible for serious violations of human rights and international law in Hong Kong&quot;. In turn, the Chinese government rejected the parliament&#x27;s &quot;smears and slanders&quot;.

<text>Sakhnin (; or &quot;Sikhnin&quot;) is a city in Israel&#x27;s Northern District. It is located in the Lower Galilee, about east of Acre. Sakhnin was declared a city in 1995. In its population was , mostly Muslim with a sizable Christian minority.
== Geography ==
Sakhnin is built over three hills and is located in a valley surrounded by mountains, the highest one being 602 meters high. Its rural landscape is almost entirely covered by olive and fig groves as well as oregano and sesame shrubs.

== History ==
Settlement at Sakhnin dates back 3,500 years to its first mention in 1479 BCE by Thutmose II, whose ancient Egyptian records mention it as a centre for production of indigo dye.

Sakhnin is situated on an ancient site, where remains from columns and cisterns have been found. It was mentioned as Sogane, a town fortified in 66, by Josephus. A cistern, excavated near the mosque in the old city centre, revealed pottery fragments dating from the 1st to the 5th century CE.

Haninah ben Teradion, who was arrested by the Roman authorities for heresy (&quot;minut&quot;), is said to have run a Torah academy there. It may be the village Kfar Sikhnin referred to in rabbinical accounts of the aftermath of the trial of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus for heresy.

In 1961 Bellarmino Bagatti, during a visit to the village, was shown a tomb venerated by Christians, Jews and Muslims, which local tradition identified as that of James the Just. On returning to the village, he discovered that restoration had been undertaken and the site renamed the burial place of Rabbi Yehoshua of Sakhnin. Richard Bauckham has raised the possibility that the Yaakov of Sikhnin in accounts of rabbi Eliezer may be James the grandson of Jude.

In the Crusader era, it was known as &quot;Zecanin&quot;. In 1174 it was one of the casalia (villages) given to &quot;Phillipe le Rous&quot;. In 1236 descendants of &quot;Phillipe le Rous&quot; confirmed the sale of the fief of Saknin.

===Ottoman era===
In 1596, Sakhnin appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Akka (Acre), part of Safad Sanjak. It had a population of 66 households and 8 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olives, cotton, in addition to a water mill; a total of 12,138 akçe.

In 1838, Sakhnin was noted as a Muslim and Christian village in the Shaghur district, located between Safad, Acre and Tiberias. In 1859 the British Consul Rogers estimated the population to be 1,100, and the cultivated area 100 feddans, while in 1875 Victor Guérin found 700 inhabitants, both Muslims and Greek Orthodox Christians.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described Sakhnin as follows: &quot;A large village of stone and mud, amid fine olive-groves, with a small mosque. The water supply is from a large pool about half a mile to the south-east. The inhabitants are Moslems and Christians&quot;. A population list from about 1887 showed that Sakhnin had about 1,915 inhabitants; 1,640 Muslims, 150 Catholic Christians and 125 Greek Christians.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Sakhnin had a population of 1,575; 1,367 Muslims and 208 Christians; 87 Orthodox and 121 Greek Catholic (Melchite). The population increased in the 1931 census to a total of 1,891; 1,688 Muslims, 202 Christians, and 1 Jew, in a total of 400 houses.

In the 1945 statistics, Sakhnin had 2,600 inhabitants; 2310 Muslims and 290 Christians. The total jurisdiction of the village was 70,192 dunams of land. 3,622 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 29,366 dunams for cereals, while 169 dunams were built-up (urban) land.
===State of Israel===

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Sakhnin surrendered to Israeli forces on July 18, 1948, during Operation Dekel, but was re-captured by Arab forces shortly afterwards. It finally fell without battle during Operation Hiram, 29–31 October 1948. Many of the inhabitants fled north but some stayed and were not expelled by the Israeli soldiers. The town remained under martial law until 1966.

In 1976, it became the site of the first Land Day marches, in which six Israeli Arabs were killed by Israeli forces during violent protests of government expropriation of of Arab-owned land near Sakhnin. Later that same year, three more civilians were killed during clashes with the police. Two natives of the city were killed in Jerusalem during the al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000.

The Israeli transcription of the Arabic toponym is an orthographic error, writing &quot;Sakhnas&quot; instead of Sakhnin.

==Sports ==

In 2003, the town&#x27;s football club, Bnei Sakhnin, became one of the first Arab teams to play in the Israeli Premier League, the top tier of Israeli football. The following year, the club won the State Cup, and was the first Arab team to do so; consequently, it participated in the UEFA Cup the following season, losing out to Newcastle United. The team received a new home with the 2005 opening of Doha Stadium, funded by the Israeli government and the Qatar National Olympic Committee, whose capital it is named after. The stadium has a capacity of 5,000.

Sakhnin is also the hometown of Abbas Suan, an Israeli international footballer who previously played for Bnei Sakhnin. The town and their soccer team are the subject of the 2010 documentary film &quot;After The Cup: Sons of Sakhnin&quot; United

On 19 September 2008, Bnei Sakhnin played a game with the Spanish team Deportivo de La Coruña.

== Shrines ==
Sakhnin is home to two shrines:

&quot;A-Sheikh Siddiq (&quot;) is a shrine located in Sakhnin&#x27;s historical core, close to the Christian cemetery. It features a Roman-period sarcophagus. The Arabs of Galilee, and the Bedouin of Arab el-Na&#x27;im in particular, used to conduct pilgrimages to the shrine in order to make vows and seek for health for themselves and their progeny. The residents of Sakhnin used to beg the saint&#x27;s forgiveness whenever they went near it out of fear, especially at night. According to a local legend, &quot;a-Sheikh Siddiq&quot; fought both the Romans and pagans. He was burned by the Romans together with his daughters as he was holding a Torah book. Guerin also referenced another tradition, that claims &quot;a-&quot;S&quot;heikh Siddiq&quot; was interred here next to his wife. Jewish tradition attributes this site to Rabbi Joshua of Sakhnin, an amora who lived in the village in the 4th century CE. Since the 13th century, the shrine has attracted Jewish and Muslim pilgrims alike.

A second shrine, &quot;a-Sheikh Ismai&#x27;l&quot;, is located in the Al-Khalaila clan cemetery in the heart of Sakhnin&#x27;s western district. This location most likely refers to a local saint rather than the biblical and Quranic Isma&#x27;il. Residents of the village claim that one of them had a dream in which the sheikh complained that the sewage water was polluting his tomb. Then, to stop the pollution, this resident constructed a drainage. Every Friday, the women of the Al-Khalaila clan light candles in the tomb.

<doc id="267450" wikidata="Q4875860" url="?curid=267450" title="Beaches of Hong Kong">
<text>Hong Kong has a long and jagged coastline with many bays and beaches. The shelter provided by adjacent mountains keeps wave sizes generally small, and most beaches are thus suitable for swimming and recreation, if they can be reached.

About half of Hong Kong&#x27;s more accessible beaches are gazetted and thus managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD). Many that are not gazetted are also popular, and some privately owned beaches are publicly accessible.

With the increasing development and urbanisation of Hong Kong, water quality has worsened resulting in the closure of several beaches previously suitable for swimming. These include Approach Beach, Ting Kau Beach, Anglers&#x27; Beach, Gemini Beaches, Hoi Mei Wan Beach, Casam Beach and Lido Beach in Tsuen Wan. In 2011, Lido Beach, Casam Beach, Approach Beach and Hoi Mei Wan Beach were reopened following an improvement in water quality.

== Gazetted beaches ==
A total of forty-two beaches in Hong Kong are gazetted and managed by LCSD. Twelve of these are located on Hong Kong Island, with the remaining 30 spread across the New Territories, including the Outlying Islands. Some are temporarily closed to swimmers.

=== Cheung Chau ===
==== Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach and Kwun Yam Beach ====

There are two main beaches on Cheung Chau: Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach () and Kwun Yam Beach () aka. Afternoon Beach. Although they are not as big as the well-known beaches along the Hong Kong Island coast, they have much character. Kwun Yam Beach is a beautiful fine white beach situated on the east coast of Cheung Chau. The water quality is good and it is classified as Grade 1. It is popular for various water sports facilities, with two centres providing rentals of windsurfers and kayaks. Many lovers like to take leisurely walks there and to enjoy the village scene which still maintains the old traditions. Also, it is where Hong Kong&#x27;s first Olympic medallist, Lee Lai Shan, first learned and practised windsurfing. A formal monument to her achievement is erected in the children&#x27;s playground on Tung Wan Beach, while an unofficial monument is to be found beside the &quot;windsurfer&quot; café and centre owned by her uncle and first coach, situated between the two beaches.

=== Lantau Island ===
==== Silver Mine Bay Beach ====
Hong Kong&#x27;s largest island, Lantau, has several beaches which are clean, uncrowded and relatively convenient to reach. For all of them, the first step is to simply take the ferry from Central to Mui Wo. Then, if necessary, one can just hop on a bus.

Silver Mine Bay Beach (), which is a Grade 1 beach, is the easiest one to get to, since it is located about a 5-minute walk away from the Mui Wo ferry pier. Since there is a sandbar area, this beach is ideal for flinging frisbees or flying kites. Further along the beach is a swimming area with several lifeguards on duty. Many visitors rent a bike for the afternoon, and stop off at the many refreshment kiosks and little restaurants along the road fronting the beach. If people do not feel like hurrying back into the city, they can also choose to stay overnight at the Silvermine Beach Hotel, located right on the waterfront. Also, there are several other hotels and guesthouses in the area where people can stay.

==== Pui O Beach ====
==== Cheung Sha Beaches ====

Cheung Sha Beach is located in Cheung Sha, on the southern shore of Lantau Island. It is divided into two parts by a small headland: Upper Cheung Sha Beach (east) and Lower Cheung Sha Beach (west). It is 3 km long and is one of the longest beaches in Hong Kong. The beaches are accessible from South Lantau Road. Tong Fuk Beach is located nearby, to the west of Lower Cheung Sha Beach.

==== Tong Fuk Beach ====
== Non-gazetted beaches ==
A number of Hong Kong&#x27;s larger non-gazetted beaches are popular, with the lack of official oversight and facilities often seen as part of their attraction. Other, smaller locations may be difficult to reach and likely exclusive for any visitor that finds them. However such non-maintained beaches may have accumulated significant flotsam and jetsam of varying attractiveness. A few bays, such as Hoi Ha, lie within protected areas and swimming may be prohibited.

== Water quality grading system ==
Gazetted beaches in Hong Kong are classified into four grades (Grades 1 – 4) according to the level of E. coli in the water of the beaches. This is done by the Environmental Protection Department. Every week, water samples of each beach are collected for analysis to determine their bacterial level.

Grade 1 means that the water quality of the beaches is good, with an E. coli count of no more than 24 per 100 mL of beach water and no known cases of skin or gastrointestinal illnesses among swimmers there.

Grade 2 means that the water quality of the beaches is fair, with an E. coli count of 25–180 per 100 mL of beach water and no more than 10 reported cases of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses per 1000 swimmers.

Grade 3 means that the water quality of the beaches is poor, with an E. coli count of 181–610 per 100 mL of beach water and 11–15 reported cases of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses per 1000 swimmers.

Grade 4 means that the water quality is very poor, with an E. coli count greater than 610 per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is greater than 15 cases per 1000 swimmers. As a result, swimming is not advised at Grade 4 beaches.

<doc id="267451" wikidata="Q1396780" url="?curid=267451" title="Nell Leyshon">
<text>Nell Leyshon is a British novelist and award-winning dramatist. She serves on the Advisory Board of the Alpine Fellowship and as the Deputy Chair of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre. Prior, she served on the Management Committee for the Society of Authors. Leyshon is known best for her novel, &quot;The Colour of Milk&quot;, which was translated into multiple languages and gained international recognition, winning the Prix Interallié in France where it was also shortlisted for the Prix Femina, and voted the book of the year in Spain.

Leyshon was born in Somerset, Glastonbury, where she grew up and attended art college before moving to London. Leyshon&#x27;s first career culminated in working as a Producer in TV commercials, working alongside directors such as Ridley and Tony Scott. After, she attended the University of Southampton prior to publishing her first novel, &quot;Black Dirt.&quot;

Leyshon&#x27;s support for marginalized communities is shown through her radio and playwright. Her work includes many dramas for BBC Radio 3 and 4, including the play &quot;Glass Eels&quot;, and a special Women’s Hour series on teenage mental health. In 2014, Leyshon wrote her first libretto, &quot;The River Keeper&quot;, for Streetwise Opera, a charity that helps homeless communities to rebuild their lives and identities. 

In 2018, she founded The Outsiders Project, a company giving voice to the unheard and marginalised members of the community of Boscombe through creative writing and photography workshops. Leyshon taught creative writing and performance, focusing on developing self-esteem and shaping the writer&#x27;s unique artistic voice. 

== Literary work ==

=== &quot;Black Dirt&quot; (2004) ===
In May 2004, Leyshon&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Black Dirt&quot;, was published by Picador and was long-listed for the Orange Prize and runner up for the Commonwealth Prize. Written in a lyrical yet spare style, &quot;Black Dirt&quot; explores the guilty silences that bind family members together - and sometimes keep them apart. It is the tale of a father and his family told, like the layering of the earth, in different tones and textures.

=== &quot;The Colour of Milk&quot; (2012) ===
In May 2012, Leyshon&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Colour of Milk&quot;, was published by Penguin. Set in England in 1830, &quot;The Colour of Milk&quot; is a work of historical fiction about an illiterate farm girl&#x27;s emotional and intellectual awakening and its devastating consequences.

=== Radio and Theatre ===
Leyshon&#x27;s first radio play, &quot;Milk&quot;, won the Richard Imison Award. Her second drama &quot;War Bride&quot; was runner up for the Meyer Whitworth Award.

In 2005, Leyshon&#x27;s play &quot;Comfort me with Apples&quot; won an Evening Standard Theatre Award for most promising playwright, was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award and was shortlisted for Susan Smith Blackburn Award.

Leyshon adapted Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; for the Lyceum, Sheffield which later transferred to the Lyric, Hammersmith. In 2010 her play &quot;Bedlam&quot; was the first written by a woman to be performed at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe.

Leyshon has also written plays for young people for National Theatre Connections, &quot;The Beauty Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Terra&quot; which was a dance theatre piece with choreography by Anthony Missem. She also wrote for Royal Theatre Plymouth and th her &quot;Word&quot;, for RADA Elders.

Subsequent radio plays include &quot;Glass Eels&quot;, &quot;Soldier Boy&quot;, &quot;Writing The Century&quot; and &quot;Jess&quot;, a Woman&#x27;s Hour drama about child mental health for Children in Need.

== The Outsiders Project ==
The Outsiders Project works with members of the community of Boscombe, and the work is shown locally then shared with a wider world. The work is designed to develop authentic voices and is of exceptional quality. Leyshon&#x27;s vision was to show that people sidelined from society can write, perform and create work at the highest level. The Outsiders Project supports the outsider community to push boundaries to prove they can create work of outstanding quality and worth.

The Outsiders Project has produced three works for the stage; &quot;Vodka Hunte&quot;rs, &quot;Secret Voices&quot; and &quot;The Truth About Men&quot;, all three as part of BEAF – Bournemouth Emerging Arts Fringe Festival 2018 and 2019.

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic they launched the Tattoo Project an online initiative to gather, tell stories and find new outsider artists.

== Teaching ==
Leyshon has been teaching for 27 years, but spent the last 17 years specialising in outsider voices. She has worked extensively with the recovery community in prisons and mental health settings. She has also worked with the Gypsy community, and has led many partnership courses for Arvon Foundation.

She has started &quot;The Lockdown Workshops&quot; a series of workshops to share her approach to writing during the lockdown.

<text>Sha&#x27;ab (; ; meaning &quot;The spur&quot;) is an Arab town and local council in the Northern District of Israel. It has an area of 5,442 dunams () of land under its jurisdiction. In its population was .

==History== 
French scholar Victor Guérin associated Sha&#x27;ab with &quot;Saab&quot;, a place mentioned by 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus. The &quot;Midrash Rabba&quot; (Leviticus Rabba s. 20,9) mentions a certain Rabbi Mani of Sha&#x27;ab, together with Yehoshua of Sakhnin and Rabbi Johanan bar Nappaha. In the 14th century, the tax income from the village was given to the wakf of the madrasah and mausoleum of the Shafi&#x27;i Manjaq in Egypt.

===Ottoman era===
In 1517, Sha&#x27;ab was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire along with the rest of Palestine. In 1573 (981 AH) Sha&#x27;ab was one of several villages in Galilee which rebelled against the Ottomans. In 1596, the village appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Acre, part of Safad Sanjak, with a population of 102 households and 37 bachelors, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, &quot;goats and bees&quot;, in addition to &quot;occasional revenues&quot;; a total of 14,354 akçe. 3/4 of the revenue went to a Waqf.

According to local tradition, the village started to flourish under anti-Ottoman rebel Zahir al-Umar (c. 1768). In 1859, the population was estimated to be 1,500. Some were Catholic, the majority Muslim. The cultivated fields were estimated to be 80 feddans. Guérin visited in the 1870s, and wrote that the village of Sh&#x27;aib consisted of four quarters. The inhabitants, he wrote, were for the most part Muslim, about 800, and some 20 &quot;Schismatic Greek&quot; families. The Muslims had two Mosques and two walis. In 1881, Sha&#x27;ab was described as being in a valley with fine olive groves, while part of the hill behind it was cultivated in corn.

A population list from about 1887 showed that Sha&#x27;ab had about 1,430 inhabitants; 1,345 Muslims and 85 Greek Catholics.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Sha&#x27;ab had a population of 1,206; 1,166 Muslims and 40 Christians, where the Christians were 15 Orthodox and 25 Melkites. The population increased slightly in the 1931 census to 1,297; 1,277 Muslims, 19 Christians and 1 Jew, in a total of 284 houses.

During the 1936 revolt in Palestine, the British Army attacked Sha&#x27;ab, demolishing 190 houses in the village. According to an eyewitness account, the British collectively punished the village for harboring a rebel who allegedly set off a roadside explosive that killed four British soldiers and injured three. A day prior to the demolition of the homes, the army rounded up around 200 of its adult male residents and led them to a valley outside the village. As they were being lined up, a rebel fighter positioned on a nearby hill began yelling and firing into the air, confusing the soldiers and causing Sha&#x27;ab&#x27;s detained men to disperse chaotically. One resident named Hassan Hajj Khatib was killed.

In the 1945 statistics, Sha&#x27;ab had 1,740 inhabitants; 30 Christians and 1,710 Muslims. They owned a total of 17,870 dunams of land, while 121 dunams were public. 3,248 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 6,602 dunams for cereals, while 231 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===State of Israel===
Sha&#x27;ab was captured by the Israel Forces (IDF) on 19 July 1948 during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The villagers surrendered without a fight. In December 1948, the residents were ordered to leave by the Oded Brigade. The village was the headquarters and hometown of Abu Is&#x27;af, who led Arab resistance groups during the war and was viewed as a hero. Many of the original residents settled in nearby Arab villages, predominantly in Majd al-Krum and Sakhnin while refugees from al-Birwa, al-Damun and Mi&#x27;ar relocated to Sha&#x27;ab after the war. Refugees from Kirad al-Ghannam and Kirad al-Baqqara in the Hula Valley joined them in 1953. The original residents launched a campaign to return to their homes soon after the war. Refugees from the Hula Valley and al-Birwa sympathized with them but those from al-Damun and Mi&#x27;ar were opposed. By 1950, roughly 10% of Sha&#x27;ab&#x27;s original inhabitants returned to the village and eventually many more obtained permission to return.

==Notable buildings==
===Mosque of Zahir al-Umar===
The mosque of Zahir al-Umar is situated in the centre of the old village. In 1933 it was inspected by Na&#x27;im Makhouly from the Palestine Antiquities Museum, who found that the mosque dated from the time of Zahir al-Umar. In 1933 the mosque was in disrepair. Pictures from the time show two arcades: one had four arches connected with the side wall, with two columns in the centre. A reused Ionic capital could be seen, and above the doorway was a reused Roman lintel (first noticed by Guérin in the 1870s).

Andrew Petersen, an archaeologist specialising in Islamic architecture, surveyed the mosque in 1994. He found that the present mosque, built in the 1980s, encased the old building. The old part is the prayer hall, has an entrance to the north. This hall is square, covered with a dome. The dome rests on large squinches, which are supported by corbels. According to Petersen, the domed prayer hall is consistent with an 18th-century construction date.

===Tomb of Shaykh Alami=== 
The Maqam Shaykh Alami is situated south of the mosque, within its enclosure. It is built at a slope, where the ground rises to the south. On the east side there are two entrances; to the maqam, and to an underground cistern.

The building is rectangular, 10 x 20 m, with an interior divided into two. The southern part contains a mihrab and is covered with a barrel vault. The northern end is covered with a dome, and has two large cenotaphs. According to Petersen, the buildings appear medieval.

<text>Agusan del Norte, officially the Province of Agusan del Norte (; Butuanon: &quot;Probinsya hong Agusan del Norte&quot;; ), is a province in the Caraga region of the Philippines. Its &quot;de jure&quot; capital is the city of Cabadbaran with several government offices located in the highly-urbanized city of Butuan, which is the largest city and its &quot;de facto&quot; capital as well as the regional center of Caraga Region. It is bordered on the northwest by Butuan Bay; northeast by Surigao del Norte; mid-east by Surigao del Sur; southeast by Agusan del Sur, and southwest by Misamis Oriental.

Prior to its creation as an independent province, Agusan, as it was once undivided, was under the jurisdiction of Surigao province during the Spanish colonial period.

===American colonial era===
In 1907, Agusan province was created as a separate province by the Philippine Commission with two sub-provinces — Butuan and Bukidnon.

===Japanese occupation===
During World War II in 1942, the Japanese Imperial forces landed in Northern Agusan.

In 1945, Filipino soldiers of the 6th, 10th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 107th and 110th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary together with the recognized Agusan guerrilla fighter units began the liberation of Northern Agusan from Japanese forces during World War II.

The capital town of Cabadbaran became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9494&quot; which sought to convert the municipality into a city. The law was ratified on July 28, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

<text>Arab al-Samniyya (), also known as Khirbat al-Suwwana, was a Palestinian village in the Western Galilee that was captured and depopulated by Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. It was located in the Acre District of the British Mandate of Palestine, 19.5 km northeast of the city of Acre. In 1945 the, village had a population of 200 Arab and a total land area of 1,872 dunums.

==History==
The village was situated on a rocky hill near the road linking Ra&#x27;s al-Naqura with Safad. Its houses were made of stone. A dirt path linked it to the coastal highway and thence to Acre. The villagers cultivated grain, figs, and olives. 

In the 1945 statistics it had a population of 200 Muslims, with 1,872 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 174 dunams were allocated to grain crops; 22 dunums were irrigated and planted with orchards.
After neighbouring villages were looted and massacred, the &#x27;Oded Brigade captured the village, as part of the Israeli Defense Force offensive Operation Hiram. .  The people of al-Samniyaa were expelled in the weeks following. 

The village was completely destroyed and only building rubble left behind. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and the village remained depopulated of its inhabitants. In 1950, the moshav of Ya&#x27;ara was established on its land.

<text>Sir Herbert Nigel Gresley (19 June 1876 – 5 April 1941) was a British railway engineer. He was one of Britain&#x27;s most famous steam locomotive engineers, who rose to become Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). He was the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives in Britain, including the LNER Class A1 and LNER Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific engines. An A1 Pacific, &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;, was the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service, and an A4, number 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot;, still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world (126 mph).

Gresley&#x27;s engines were considered elegant, both aesthetically and mechanically. His invention of a three-cylinder design with only two sets of Walschaerts valve gear, the Gresley conjugated valve gear, produced smooth running and power at lower cost than would have been achieved with a more conventional three sets of Walschaerts gear.
==Biography==
Gresley was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, during his mother&#x27;s visit there to see a gynaecologist, but was raised in England at Netherseal, Derbyshire, a member of a cadet branch of a family long seated at Gresley, Derbyshire. After attending school in Sussex and at Marlborough College, Gresley served his apprenticeship at the Crewe works of the London and North Western Railway, afterwards becoming a pupil under John Aspinall at Horwich of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR). After several minor appointments with the L&amp;YR he was made Outdoor Assistant in the Carriage and Wagon Department in 1901; in 1902 he was appointed Assistant Works Manager at Newton Heath depot, and Works Manager the following year.

He became Assistant Superintendent of the Carriage and Wagon Department of the L&amp;YR in 1904 and a year later moved to the Great Northern Railway (GNR) as Carriage and Wagon Superintendent. He succeeded Henry A. Ivatt as CME of the GNR on 1 October 1911. At the 1923 Grouping, he was appointed CME of the newly formed LNER (the post had originally been offered to the ageing John G. Robinson; Robinson declined and suggested the much younger Gresley). 

During the 1930s, Sir Nigel Gresley lived at Salisbury Hall, near St Albans in Hertfordshire. Gresley developed an interest in breeding wild birds and ducks in the moat including Mallard ducks. The Hall still exists today as a private residence and is adjacent to the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre, with its links to the design of the famous Mosquito aircraft during World War II.

In 1936, Gresley designed the 1,500 V DC locomotives for the proposed electrification of the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield. The Second World War forced the postponement of the project, which was completed in the early 1950s. Edgar Claxton was Gresley&#x27;s assistant throughout this project, working on power supply, equipment and systems, besides carrying out the trials.

Gresley was appointed CBE in 1920 and was knighted in the 1936 Birthday Honours by King Edward VIII. Also in the latter year, Gresley was awarded an honorary DSc by Manchester University and presided over the IMechE.

Gresley died on 5 April 1941, after a short illness, and was buried in the Churchyard Extension of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Netherseal, Derbyshire. At this time, Gresley was serving as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Engineers Railway Staff Corps.

He was succeeded as the LNER CME by Edward Thompson.

==Memorials==
A memorial plaque to Gresley&#x27;s achievements was unveiled at Edinburgh Waverley railway station in 2001. It was created by the Gresley Society and incorporates line drawings of his &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; and &quot;Mallard&quot; locomotives.

Following the redevelopment of the site previously home to Doncaster College, the square outside the new Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council Offices and Cast Theatre was named Sir Nigel Gresley Square, in honour of the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives built at Doncaster Plant Works following a public poll of Doncaster residents. Sir Nigel Gresley Square was opened to the public in May 2012 as part of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, by the Mayor of Doncaster Mr. Peter Davies and two of Nigel Gresley&#x27;s grandsons.

LNER Class A4 4498 &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; is named after its designer.

A statue of Gresley was unveiled at King&#x27;s Cross station in London on 5 April 2016, the 75th anniversary of his death. Sculptor Hazel Reeves originally included a duck alongside Gresley in reference to his hobby of breeding water fowl and his bird-themed locomotive names such as &quot;Mallard&quot;, but this was removed from the final design when two of Gresley&#x27;s grandsons complained it was &quot;demeaning&quot;.

The Wetherspoons public house in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, is named &quot;The Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; in his honour. 

He was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame in 2023.

<text>Agusan del Sur, officially the Province of Agusan del Sur (; Butuanon: &quot;Probinsya hong Agusan del Sur&quot;; ), is a province in Caraga region, Mindanao, Philippines. Its capital is the municipality of Prosperidad. It is bordered on the northwest by Agusan del Norte and Misamis Oriental; east by Surigao del Sur; southeast by Davao Oriental; mid-south by Davao de Oro; southwest by Davao del Norte and, mid-west by Bukidnon. It is the fourth largest province in the country in terms of area, with the size of 3,856 sq miles.

Bayugan is the only city in the province and it is also the most populous city. It is the largest and the only landlocked province in the region.

==Etymology==
Agusan derives its name from the Agusan word &quot;agasan&quot;, meaning &quot;where the water flows&quot;, referring to the Agusan River that splits the land and meanders south to north in a rush to Butuan Bay. It is third largest river in the country and served as highway for the Spanish colonizers in gaining access to inner northeastern Mindanao.

==History==
===Early history===
The history of Agusan del Sur is essentially linked with that of its sister province, Agusan del Norte.

Agusans pre-Hispanic cultural history is traced back to the great influence of the Majapahit Empire through the discovery of an tall image of a woman in pure gold at Maasam, Esperanza in 1917 and molten jars unearthed at Bah-bah, Prosperidad. The aborigines of Agusan del Sur are the ancestors of the present day Mamanwas, who were driven to the hinterlands by waves of Malay immigrants. These immigrants, in turn, sought the protection of the interior jungles because of the forays and the constant raids of the Moros, who were seafaring people confined to coastal areas where they started their settlements.

===Spanish colonial era===
The Augustinian Recollects established a mission in Linao, in the vicinity of present-day Bunawan, in 1614. However, mission work was hampered by the hostility of the surrounding Manobo tribes. At the height of the power of the Sultanate of Maguindanao in the mid-17th century, the Manobos of the Agusan Valley were in alliance with Sultan Kudarat. Linao was attacked several times during the 1629 Caraga Revolt and the 1649 Sumuroy Revolt. Nevertheless, the Recollects were able to establish themselves in their mission work, and remained there until the middle of the 19th century.

In the late 19th century, the Recollects (under protest) turned over many of their mission territories, including those in the upper Agusan region, to the reconstituted Jesuit order (the Jesuits had been banned by Papal edict in the 1760s, and ejected from the Philippines in 1768). Missionary work was interrupted by the Philippine Revolution when the Jesuits either fled or were arrested by revolutionaries. The territory of Agusan del Sur was governed as part of the province of Caraga during most of the Spanish period. In 1860, it was placed under the &quot;comandancia&quot; of Butuan, a district of the province of Surigao.

===American colonial era===
During the American occupation, lumbering became an important activity in Agusan del Sur. Visayan migrants settled in the cleared plains, pushing Indigenous communities farther into the mountainous slopes.

In 1914, the province of Agusan was created by the American government.

The Agusan Valley was settled by a variety of cultural communities like the Manobos, Mamanwas and Higaonons. Archeological excavations in the lower Agusan valley plains have uncovered evidence of strong relationships between the region and the Southeast Asian states. A golden image of Javan-Indian design unearthed in the 1920s and molten jars uncovered in Prosperidad are indications that the region had commercial and cultural ties with the coast.

===Japanese occupation===
In the Second World War, Japanese troops landed in the province of Agusan in 1942 and occupied the province until their defeat by combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth troops as well as recognized guerrilla units in 1945 at the Battle of Agusan.

The general headquarters and military camp and base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active again from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, are military stationed in the province of Surigao was composed to engaging operations against the Japanese Occupation.

During World War II, a unit of the joint Philippine-American defense force was located at Manot, Talacogon, in the interior of the Agusan Valley.

===Philippine independence===
The province of Agusan del Sur was established on June 17, 1967, under &quot;Republic Act No. 4969&quot; providing for the division of the province of Agusan into Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur.

In January 1970, the first set of provincial officials assumed office after the provincial election of November, 1969. The same law provided that the capital of Agusan del Sur be the municipality of Prosperidad. The Government Center has been set up in Barangay Patin-ay.

===Contemporary===
The municipality of Bayugan became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9405&quot; which sought to convert the municipality into a city. The law was ratified on June 21, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

==Geography==
===Land area===
In 1976, the province&#x27;s land area was , making it the seventh largest province in the country. After claiming the disputed boundary between Davao del Norte, Butuan and with the creation of Sibagat, Agusan del Sur now has an area of .

The municipalities of Loreto, La Paz, Esperanza, and San Luis are the four largest municipalities in land area comprising almost 60% of the province&#x27;s total land area. Santa Josefa and Talacogon, also river towns, have the smallest land area.

Forestland constitutes 76% of the total land area or while the alienable and disposable constitutes about 24% or . Present land use, however, showed that settlements and commercial areas already occupy some of the forestlands.

Through the years, the province has lost much of its forest resources because existing industries are extractive in nature.

===Topography===
Agusan del Sur is an elongated basin formation with mountain ranges in the eastern and western sides forming a valley, which occupies the central longitudinal section of the land. The Agusan River, which flows from Davao de Oro in the south towards Agusan del Norte in the north, runs almost in the middle of the valley and empties at Butuan Bay. The river has twelve tributaries: Wawa, Gibong and Simulao Rivers in the eastern side and Ojot, Pusilao, Kasilayan, Libang, Maasam, Adgawan, Cawayan, Umayam and Ihaon Rivers in the western side. These tributaries are fed by streams and creeks. The southern half of the province from the municipality of Veruela is an area filled with swamps and lakes, the biggest of which is Talacogon Lake.

===Climate===
The climate map of the Philippines based on the modified coronas classification shows that the province falls under Type II.

Type II climate has no dry season with very pronounced wet season of heavy precipitation. Maximum rainfall generally occurs from December to January although there is no single dry month. Its average monthly rainfall is and average temperature is . Areas characterized by this climate type are generally along or very near the eastern coast thus are open to the northeast monsoon.

The Higaonons live mostly on the western side of Agusan River, generally in Esperanza towards the boundary with Bukidnon.

The Agusan del Sur population is predominantly composed of migrants from the Visayas, who came from Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor and Negros Oriental as well as Cebuano-speaking parts of Mindanao. There are also significant minority residents in the province whose descendants came from Ilocandia, Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mindoro, Marinduque, Bicolandia, Panay, Negros Occidental and Samar. Intermarriages between migrants and natives have pulled down the percentage of the lumad stock.

<text>Al-Qubayba (), also known as Gbebah, Qubeiba or Qobebet Ibn &#x27;Awwad, was a Palestinian village, located 24 kilometers northwest of Hebron. 

==Name==
The eponym of the village, &quot;Ibn &#x27;Awwad&quot; or &quot;Ibn &#x27;Awadh&quot;, was named after the clan residing therein.

==History==
Known in Crusader times as Deirelcobebe, the ruins of the ancient Canaanite and Judean city of Lachish lay adjacent to the village, which was subject to extensive archaeological excavations by the British Mandatory authorities in Palestine, and by Israeli authorities subsequent to its capture during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

In 1136 the King of Jerusalem, Fulk confirmed &quot;Deirelcobebe&quot; as a casale under the Knights Hospitallers.
===Ottoman Empire===
In 1517, Al-Qubayba was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers as being in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Gaza under the &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot; (district) of Gaza. It had a population of 33 Muslim household, an estimated 182 persons. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, sesame, and fruit trees, as well as goats and beehives; a total of 4,600 akçe. 11/24 of the revenue went to a Waqf.

In 1838 Edward Robinson noted 200 reapers and gleaners at work in a field near Al-Qubayba (which he called &quot;Kubeibeh&quot;). He added: &quot;Some were taking their refreshment, and offered us some of their &quot;parched corn.&quot; In the season of harvest, the grains of wheat, not yet fully dry and hard, are roasted in a pan or an iron plate, and constitute a very palliative article of bread; this is eaten along with bread, or instead of it.&quot; Robinson further noted &quot;Kubeibeh&quot; as a Muslim village, in the Gaza district.

In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Al-Qubayba as a large village built of adobe brick, situated on rolling hills near a plain, surrounded by a barren and stony area.

===British Mandate===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Al-Qubaiba&quot; had a population of 646, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 800, still all Muslim, in a total of 141 houses.

The village had a school, a mosque, and a number of small shops. Two wells located northwest and southwest of it provided drinking water.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Al-Qubayba was 1,060, all Muslims, who owned 11,912 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 8109 dunams were for cereals while 35 dunams were built-up (urban) land.
Al-Qubayba was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan.

===Israel===
The village was first attacked during Operation Barak. Though defended by Egyptian forces, al-Qubayba was taken by Israeli forces in the final stages of Operation Yoav on 28 October 1948. The population had fled and the village was destroyed.

The area was subsequently incorporated into the State of Israel and in 1955 the moshav of Lakhish was established to the southwest of the village site on what had been village lands.

Of the village mosque, an elementary school, and more than 141 houses that made up al-Qubayba, Walid Khalidi notes that all that remains to mark the site in contemporary times are cacti and a handful of olive trees.

==Culture and village life==
The inhabitants of the village mostly grew cereals; wheat and barley were grown by the well off, and corn by the rest. The village mostly bartered with surrounding villages such as Al-Dawayima and Beit Gibrin, most of the cereals harvest was used to sustain sheep herds, from where in most of the village income is derived.

A woman&#x27;s &quot;thob&quot; (loose fitting robe with sleeves), from Qubeiba dated to about 1910 forms part of the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe. The dress is a collage of different fabrics, textures and colors. The front and the upper half of the back are of black cotton. The chest panel, the side panels and the lower back of the skirt are handwoven indigo linen. Colorful silk cross-stitch embroidery, in red, violet, orange, yellow, green and black, create an effect described as &quot;particularly gay, twinkling&quot; The &quot;qabbeh&quot; (square chest panel) is embroidered with the &quot;qurunful&quot; (&quot;clove&quot;) motif, and it has vertical rows of eight-pointed stars, called &quot;qamr&quot; (&quot;moons&quot;), and a row of the &quot;mushut&quot; (&quot;combs&quot;) pattern. There are eight embroidered columns on each side panel of the dress. The patterns which are used are &quot;fanajin qahweh&quot; (&quot;coffee cups&quot;), &quot;khem-el-basha&quot; (&quot;the pashas tent&quot;), &quot;irq el-ward&quot; (&quot;rose branch&quot;), and &quot;miftah Khalil&quot; (&quot;key of Hebron&quot;). There is also a pattern (with flowers, moons, trees, tents and tiles) not seen anywhere else in the MOMA collection. Finally, there is also some embroidery at the wrists.

<text>Glass Eels is a play written by Nell Leyshon, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in July 2003.
The play has also been performed on stage at the Hampstead Theatre, it is the second part of a planned quartet of Somerset plays covering the four seasons the first being the award winning &quot;Comfort Me with Apples&quot;.

The play is set on the Somerset Levels one August, probably on the River Parrett. While it explores a young girl&#x27;s sexual awakening, and her acceptance of past loss, it also concerns eel fishing and a dying rural way of life.

<text>Surigao del Norte (Surigaonon: &quot;Probinsya nan Surigao del Norte&quot;; ; Tagalog: &quot;Hilagang Surigao&quot;), officially the Province of Surigao del Norte, is a province in the Philippines located in the Caraga region of Mindanao. The province was formerly under the jurisdiction of Region 10 (Northern Mindanao) until 1995. Its capital is Surigao City, the most populous in the province. The province comprises two major islands—Siargao and Bucas Grande—in the Philippine Sea, plus a small area at the northeastern tip of mainland Mindanao and other surrounding minor islands and islets. This mainland portion borders Agusan del Norte – between the Municipality of Alegria in Surigao del Norte and the Municipality of Kitcharao in Agusan del Norte; and the province of Surigao del Sur, to the south.

Surigao del Norte is the second northernmost of the Mindanao provinces and is an important commerce and transportation hub between Visayas and Mindanao. Numerous ferries cross the Surigao Strait between Surigao and the island of Leyte transporting vehicles, cargoes, and passengers between Liloan in Southern Leyte and Surigao City.

==Etymology==

There are two presumptions on the original meaning of &quot;Surigao&quot; among linguists, depending on the original root word. If the root word was taken to be &quot;sulig&quot; (&quot;sprout&quot; or &quot;spring up&quot;), then Surigao may have derived from &quot;&quot; (&quot;spring water&quot;), likely referring to the Surigao River (known as &quot;Suligaw&quot; in Mandaya) that empties at the northern tip of the island of Mindanao. Early historical accounts record the name of the river as , Surigao, or Zurigan.

Another possibility is that it is derived from Visayan &quot;surogao&quot; or &quot;&quot;suyogao&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;water current&quot;. From &quot;suyog&quot; (also &quot;sulog&quot; or &quot;&quot;), &quot;current&quot;. Other Visayan words derived from the same root include Sinulog, Sulu, and Tausug (Suluk).

==History==

===Spanish colonial era===
Rajah Siawi and Rajah Kulambo, members of the nobility of the Surigaonon and Butuanon people, respectively, were encountered by the Magellan expedition in 1521 on the island of Limasawa (which was a hunting ground for the rulers). Antonio Pigafetta describes them as being tattooed and covered in gold ornaments. Pigafetta also records the name of the Surigao region as &quot;Calagan&quot;.

The explorer Ruy López de Villalobos headed an expedition to Surigao in 1543, an attempt at subjugation which failed because of the resistance of the natives. At that time the island of Mindanao was given the name Caesarea Caroli, in honor of Carlos V of Spain. Jesuit missionaries visited Butuan in 1597 but did not make much progress in Christianizing the people. It was not until 1609, when a full-dress expedition was launched, that Spanish authority was imposed to Tandag. In 1622, the arrival of the Recollect missionaries in Tandag commenced the establishment of a permanent mission in Surigao.

The area of Surigao del Norte was once part of an ancient district referred to as &quot;Caraga&quot; during the Spanish colonial period named after its chief inhabitants, the Caraga tribe or Caragans who were largely concentrated in a settlement called Caraga. The ancient district of Caraga, which was established in 1609 comprised all of the present day provinces of Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Sur, the northern part of Davao Oriental and eastern Misamis Oriental. The seat of government was at Tandag until it was transferred to the town of Surigao in 1848. Six Spanish military districts were established in Mindanao in 1860 and the areas of present-day Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Dinagat Islands, Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur (collectively called Agusan back then), including the territory lying between present day Butuan and Caraga bays, formed the third district called the &quot;East District&quot; which was changed in 1870 to &quot;Distrito de Surigao&quot;. By the end of the Spanish rule in 1897, Agusan had been organized as a single politico-military comandancia named &quot;Butuan&quot;, within the administrative jurisdiction of Distrito de Surigao.

====Surigao during the Philippine Revolution====
On December 23, 1898, the last Spanish Governor of Surigao turned his authority over to a provisional Filipino &quot;Junta Provincial&quot; Peacefully. The Spanish Government along with the Spanish community soon left Surigao by the next day on December 24 leaving behind Spanish missionaries. They were sent off with the sound of music and goodwill by the locals. The Junta Provincial elected Jantoy Gonzalez to serve as the Provisional head while waiting for the arrival of the new authority from Luzon that was sent by Aguinaldo.

The New Authority under Aguinaldo&#x27;s Supreme Revolutionary Government arrived in Surigao by January 12, 1899, they were the brothers Simon and Wenceslao Gonzales, children of Jantoy Gonzales.

==== Confiscation of Church Estate ====
Immediately after the arrival of the Gonzalez Brothers, they carried the orders of the Malolos Leadership which included the imprisonment of Spanish Missionaries, Confiscation of Church funds and other church properties.

===American Occupation===
==== Garcia Coup ====
by March 24, 1899, a new military and political figure appeared in Surigao. Don Prudencio Garcia staged a coup which resulted in the imprisonment of the Gonzalezes (Jantoy, Simon, and Wencaslao), and were killed shortly after in Cortez (now Surigao del Sur).Finally, on April 2, 1899, at 12 midnight they were put in a boat, well handcuffed, and shipped out to the Pacific, and upon arriving at Cortes they shot them down. They had been guarded by soldiers and officials who were all personal enemies of the Gonzalezes. In Cortes they were put under the custody of a mestizo, Hilarion Marinez, whom the Gonzalezes had maltreated by words and deeds. He avenged himself by having them fusilated. That was the Tragic end of our enemies (&quot;Apuntes...&quot; p. 116)The news of what led to the deaths of the Gonzalezes did not reach Aguinaldo as they were given false information to their deaths. Aguinaldo was given a message from an &quot;unknown correspondent&quot; which stated&quot;General Simon Gonzales and his brother Wencaslao, the Governor of Surigao has been assassinated for collecting excessive contribution in money for the war, and their successors have also been assassinated by the Moros who form a greater part of the population and who have revolted against Filipino rule&quot; (Philippine Insurgent Record 1039.5 in Taylor)the letter stated that the Gonzales were assassinated, and that the Moros were blamed for the deaths of the predecessors despite having barely any Moros in Surigao by that time.

==== Narciso v. Garcia ====
After the execution of the Gonzalezes, Hermenegildo Narciso (A former ally of Garcia) claimed the position of Governor. By around July 1899, an estimated 400 men armed against Garcia took position outside the Provincial Capital (Surigao City) with 80 men in the trenches near the exit of the town. On July 8, 1899, Garcia returned to Surigao from Banganga with all the honors befitting as

 a General. Governor Narciso (who was still in Manila) was expected to return to Surigao to take full control of the Provincial Junta.

July 6, 1899, Soldiers (Garcia) began defending the Government house and Military Quarters in Provincial Capital, and at 6 o&#x27;clock Garcia&#x27;s Soldiers and Narciso&#x27;s soldiers had a shooting exchange. By 7 o&#x27;clock Garcia prepared to leave Surigao via sea. The soldiers of Narciso began their offensive when the boat began embarking equipment. They took position behind Acacia trees, and once they were discovered both sides exchanged fire. Garcia&#x27;s soldiers retreated to the port and those who were not able to embark the boat with General Garcia were forced into hiding or surrender. The area of the conflict is located at the present day Surigao Luneta Park and alongside the street of Borromeo. The Province of Surigao would then be engulfed in a Military rivalry between Governor Narciso and General Garcia, with Surigao and Butuan held by Narciso while Placer, Cantilan, and Tandag being held by Garcia. This Military Rivalry would be put to a close by the American Occupation of the Province.

==== Division of Surigao ====
Distrito de Surigao became a chartered province on May 15, 1901 (&quot;Philippine Commission Act 127&quot;). The territorial expanse of the Surigao province was further reduced in 1907 when the politico-military of Butuan, then a sub-province of Surigao, was created into a separate province and officially named it Agusan with present-day Butuan as its capital.

===Philippine independence===
On September 18, 1960, through &quot;Republic Act 2786&quot; dated June 19, 1960, the province of Surigao was divided into the present-day provinces of &quot;Surigao del Norte&quot; and &quot;Surigao del Sur&quot;. Agusan province was later dissolved and divided into the present-day provinces of Agusan del Norte (retains present day Butuan as capital) and Agusan del Sur in 1967 by &quot;Republic Act No. 4979&quot;. The town of Surigao became a city on August 30, 1970, pursuant to &quot;RA 6134&quot;.

===Contemporary===
Dinagat Islands had been a part of the First District of Surigao del Norte until becoming a province on its own on December 2, 2006, with the approval of &quot;Republic Act No. 9355&quot;, the Charter of the Province of Dinagat Islands, in a plebiscite. Between February 2010 and March 2011, the islands were part again of Surigao del Norte after declaring &quot;RA 9355&quot; unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, then were reinstated as a separate province.

Its biggest islands are usually mountainous and rich in minerals. Nonoc Island has one of the world&#x27;s largest deposits of nickel. The smaller ones either rest on sand and gravel or have a limestone base bonded by boulders, reefs and sandbars. Some islets which include those in Del Carmen in Siargao Island are a cluster of rock formations jutting out from the sea covered with shrubs and coconut trees.
===Climate===
Surigao del Norte has no pronounced dry season, receiving maximum rainfall from November to January. It is among the top 20 most vulnerable provinces to climate change in the Philippines.

===Administrative divisions===

Surigao del Norte comprises 20 municipalities and 1 component city, organized into two legislative districts and further subdivided into 335 barangays. The 1st legislative district comprises nine municipalities on the islands of Siargao and Bucas Grande (plus smaller islands); the 2nd legislative district comprises Surigao City and eleven other municipalities on the mainland of Mindanao. Surigao City has the most number of Barangays with 54, while the Municipalities of Burgos and San Benito has the least number of Barangays each with six.

The province is host to a variety of marine ecosystems like the lush seagrass beds and coral reefs which are relatively healthy and intact, supporting a rich diversity of marine flora and fauna.

Over 23 different species are caught the whole year round. Marlin, tuna, lapu-lapu, mollusks, crabs, even squids, stingrays and octopuses can be bought from fish vendors and fishermen.

The unique &quot;magcono&quot; (ironwood) forests of Surigao del Norte are one of the watersheds most productive resources. By its nature, it is slow growing and adapted to a mineralized soil.

<text>Al-Dawayima, Dawaymeh or Dawayma () was a Palestinian town, located in the former Hebron Subdistrict of Mandatory Palestine, and in what is now the Lakhish region, some 15 kilometres south-east of Kiryat Gat.

According to a 1945 census, the town&#x27;s population was 3,710, and the village lands comprised a total land area of 60,585 dunums of which nearly half was cultivable. The population figures for this town also included the populations of nearby khirbets, or ancient villages. During the 1948 Palestine war, the al-Dawayima massacre occurred. According to Saleh Abd al-Jawad an estimated 80-200 civilian men, women and children were killed. According to John Bagot Glubb, a UN report said that 30 women and children were killed.

In 1955, the ruins of the town were replaced by the Israeli moshav of Amatzia.

==History==
It has been occasionally identified with the Old Testament town of &quot;Bosqat&quot;, the home of Josiah&#x27;s mother Jedidah (2 Kings, 22:1) though the association has not found widespread acceptance.

Al-Dawayima&#x27;s historical remains encompass a long period from the Bronze Age, through to the Persian and Hellenistic, down to the Ottoman period. Bulldozing what remains of the Palestinian village to prepare a new Israeli village has revealed an ancient olive press, a columbarium cave, a villa from the Second Temple era, and both mikvehs and cisterns.

The &quot;core clan&quot; of Al-Dawayima were the Ahdibs, who traced their origin to the Muslim conquest and settlement of Palestine in the seventh century.

===Ottoman era===
In the late Ottoman era, in May, 1838, Edward Robinson visited during harvesting time. He noted that Al-Dawayima was situated on a hill, with a view of several villages to the east. During the harvest, several Christians from Beit Jala were employed here as labourers; the barley harvest was coming to an end, while the wheat harvest was just beginning. He further noted it as a Muslim village, between the mountains and Gaza, but subject to the government of el-Khulil.

In 1863 Victor Guérin visited twice, and he estimated that the village contained 900 inhabitants, while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 found that Dawaime had only a population of 85, in a total of 34 houses, though the population count included men, only. It also noted that it was located west of Hebron.

In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described al-Dawayima as a village on a high stony ridge that had olive groves beneath it. On a higher ridge to the west stood a shrine that was topped by a white stone.

The people of al-Dawayima were Muslims. They maintained several religious shrines, chief among them the shrine of Shaykh ´Ali. This shrine had a large courtyard, a number of rooms, and one large hall for prayers, and was surrounded by fig and carob trees and cactuses. It attracted visitors from the neighboring villages. A mosque was located in the village center, it was maintained by the followers of &quot;al-tariqa al-khalwatiyya&quot;, a Sufi mystic order founded by Shaykh Umar al-Khalwati (d.1397)

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;AI Dawaima&quot; had a population of 2,441 inhabitants, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 2,688, still all Muslim, in a total of 559 houses.

The villagers expanded and renovated the village mosque in the 1930s, and added a tall minaret.

In the 1945 statistics, Al-Dawayima had a population of 3,710 Muslims, with a total land area of 60.585 dunums of land.
By 1944/45, 21,191 dunums of village land were allotted to cereals, 1,206 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while 179 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.

The Institute for Palestine Studies and The Palestinian Museum note the following about the town&#x27;s built environment:&quot;Shops were scattered throughout the various neighborhoods of the village center. Houses were made of stone and mud, separated by narrow streets and alleys. The older houses were clustered closely together. Each set of houses shared a &quot;hawsh&quot;, a large courtyard that provided space for women to do their domestic chores, for children to play, and for families to gather in the evening and on special occasions. As the village expanded people began to build new houses outside of the village core. These new houses were larger and built of whitewashed stone some of them had thick, stone walls and were called &quot;jidaris&quot; (from the Arabic word for wall, &quot;jidar&quot;)...Each house had two levels: the upper level was occupied by the family members and the lower level by their animals. The houses of the well-to-do villagers had their own courtyards and large guest rooms, in addition to animal stables.&quot;

===1948 war and aftermath===

Al-Dawaymima was captured by Israel&#x27;s Eighty Ninth Battalion (commanded by Dov Chesis) of the 8th Armored Brigade led by the founder of the Palmach, Yitzhak Sadeh, after Operation Yoav on 29 October 1948, five days after the start of the truce. It was the site of the al-Dawayima massacre in which 80–200 civilians were killed, including women and children. According to Lieutenant-General John Bagot Glubb, a British officer stationed with Jordanian&#x27;s Arab Legion in Bethlehem and Hebron at that time, the massacre was calculated to drive out the villagers and had been reported by UN observers to involve 30 deaths. The massacre was cited by Yigal Allon as the reason for the halting of the creeping annexation that included Bayt Jibrin, Qubeiba and Tel Maresha. It was also seen as a reprisal by the Israelis for the massacre of Jews in Kfar Etzion months before, on May 13, 1948, by Palestinian fighters and some members of the Arab Legion.

The moshav of Amatzia was established in 1955 on land that had belonged to Al-Dawayima. According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi :&quot;The site has been fenced in. A cowshed, a chicken coop, and granaries have been built at its center (which has been leveled). The southern side of the site contains stone terraces and the remnants of a house. The eastern side is occupied by the residential area of the moshav.&quot;

In 2013, the whole area, apart from some ancient Jewish remains, was bulldozed to pave the way for the erection of a new community called Karmei Katif, which was completed in 2016 and which houses evacuees of the Gaza Strip settlements. The new name is reminiscent of Gush Katif.

==Culture==
A woman&#x27;s &quot;thob&quot; (loose fitting robe with sleeves) dated to about 1910 that was produced in Al-Dawayima is part of the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe. The dress is of hand-woven blue indigo linen. The embroidery is in predominantly red silk cross-stitch, with touches of violet, orange, yellow, white, green and black. The upper half of the &quot;qabbeh&quot; (the square chest panel) is embroidered with alternating columns of diamonds, (a pattern known as &quot;el-ferraneh&quot;), and eight-pointed stars, (called &quot;qamr&quot; (&quot;moons&quot;)). The lower half of the qabbeh is in the &quot;qelayed&quot; (&quot;necklaces&quot;) pattern. The side-panels of the skirt are completely covered with embroidered columns. Among the patterns used here are: &quot;nakhleh&quot; (&quot;palm&quot;) motif, &quot;ward-wil-aleq&quot; (&quot;rose-and-leech&quot;) and &quot;khem-el-basha&quot; (&quot;the pashas tent&quot;). Each column is topped with various trees. There is no embroidery on the long, pointed sleeves.

The village is often featured in the works of Palestinian artist Abdul Hay Mosallam who was expelled from it in 1948.

By 2011, two books about the village history had been published.

===In popular culture===
*In the 2008 film Salt of this Sea, Al-Dawayima is the village which Emad, the male protagonist, hails from. The village ruins serve as the temporary residence of the main characters, Emad and Soraya. The film is dedicated to the memory of the Al-Dawayima massacre.

<text>″Ajjur () was a Palestinian Arab village of over 3,700 inhabitants in 1945, located northwest of Hebron. It became depopulated in 1948 after several military assaults by Israeli military forces. Agur, Tzafririm, Givat Yeshayahu, Li-On, and Tirosh were built on the village lands.

== History ==
Near &#x27;Ajjur, at &quot;Khirbet Jannaba al-Fauqa&quot;, was a probable site of the Battle of Ajnadayn, waged in the 7th-century CE between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire, and which resulted in a decisive Rashidun victory, incorporating most of Palestine into the domains of Islam. The village of &#x27;Ajjur itself was built during early Fatimid rule in the region in the early twelfth century CE. A mosque was built during this period and continued to serve &#x27;Ajjur&#x27;s community until its demise. The village &#x27;Ajjur is believed to be named after &quot;a sort of cucumber.&quot;
===Ottoman era===
Arab chronicler Mujir ad-Din reported that he passed through &#x27;Ajjur on his way from Gaza to Jerusalem in the early sixteenth century, when the village was a part of the Ottoman Empire. By 1596, &#x27;Ajjur was a part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; (&quot;subdistrict&quot;) of Gaza, part of Sanjak Gaza, with 35 Muslim households; an estimated 193 persons. It paid a fine tax rate of 33,3 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, fruit, vineyards, beehives, and goats; a total of 5,500 akçe

In 1838 Edward Robinson noted the village as being &quot;small&quot;, located in the Gaza district. The villagers were Muslim.

In 1863 Victor Guérin estimated the population to be around 800. Guérin further noted that several houses, including that of the local Sheikh, were built partly with ancient stones. Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that &#x27;Ajjur had 86 houses and a population of 254, though the population count included men, only. Hartmann found that &#x27;Ajjur had 120 houses.

In 1882, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described &#x27;Ajjur as a small village containing olive trees, with most of its houses clustered together, but some dispersed to the west and south. A private school named Abu Hasan was established in this period.

In 1896 the population of &#x27;Ajjur was estimated to be about 1,767 persons.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &#x27;Ajjur had a population of 2,073 inhabitants, all Muslim, increasing in the 1931 census to 2,917; 4 Christians and the rest Muslims, in a total of 566 residential houses.

During this period, &#x27;Ajjur became economically active in its vicinity. It held a Friday market or &quot;souk&quot; that attracted consumers and merchants from nearby towns and villages. A second school was founded in the village in 1934, which served students from nearby villages as well as from &#x27;Ajjur. Like other Arab villages in Palestine at the time, &#x27;Ajjur depended on agriculture, which was the basis of its economy. The main crops were olives and wheat. The second most important economic activity was animal husbandry, in particular, goat herding. Animal ownership was a symbol of social status and pride in the village, and residents gave affectionate names to certain types of animals. Animal herding caused seasonal movement by herders to distant dwellings from the village site, but still in its vicinity such as Khirbet al-Sura and Khirbet al-&#x27;Ammuriyya. Shoemaking, carpentry, and tanning were other common occupations in &#x27;Ajjur.

In the 1945 statistics, &#x27;Ajjur had a population of 3,730; 10 Christians and 3,720 Muslims, with a total of 58,074 dunams of land. Of this, 2,428 dunums were irrigated or used for plantations, 25,227 dunams were used for cereals, while 171 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.

===1948 War and aftermath ===
On 23 October 1948, the Fourth Battalion of Israel‘s Giv&#x27;ati Brigade occupied ‘Ajjur in the northern front of Operation Yoav, unifying Israeli military operations in the southern and western fronts. Most of ‘Ajjur’s inhabitants had fled before this assault—their flight was triggered by an earlier attack, on 23 July-24.

In 1992, the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village: “Only three houses remain; two are deserted and one has been turned into a warehouse. One of the deserted houses is a two-story stone structure with a large, triple-arched front porch.” Petersen, who inspected the place in 1994, noted “a large two-story building with a vaulted arcade on the northern side. The upper part of the building is today used as a house while the lower part appears to be abandoned (although it remains locked). The arcade consists of three cross-vaulted bays resting on two free-standing piers and two engaged piers at either end. On the outer (north) face of each of the two central piers there is a stone carved with two rosettes which appears to be part of a classical entablature. The outer arches are emphasized by a flat hood molding. Each bay is covered with a cross-vault which reaches a height of approximately 4m. [..] The upper floor is reached by an external staircase on the east side leading to a walled terrace above the arcade. [..] The identity or function of this building is not known although its design and orientation indicate that it may be a mosque.” In 2000, Meron Benvenisti observed that: “Three large, beautiful structures, which were located outside the village amid orchards of fruit trees, have been renovated, and Jewish families live in them. In one, chamber music concerts are held.”

<doc id="267469" wikidata="Q13891" url="?curid=267469" title="Surigao del Sur">
<text>Surigao del Sur (Surigaonon: &quot;Probinsya nan Surigao del Sur&quot;; ; ), officially the Province of Surigao del Sur, is a province in the Philippines located in the Caraga region in Mindanao. Its capital is Tandag City while Bislig is the most populous city in the province. Surigao del Sur is situated at the eastern coast of Mindanao and faces the Philippine Sea to the east.

==Etymology==

There are two hypotheses on the original meaning of &quot;Surigao&quot; among linguists, depending on the original root word. If the root word was taken to be &quot;sulig&quot; (&quot;sprout&quot; or &quot;spring up&quot;), then Surigao may have derived from (&quot;spring water&quot;), likely referring to the Surigao River (known as &quot;Suligaw&quot; in Mandaya) that empties at the northern tip of the island of Mindanao. Early historical accounts record the name of the river as , Surigao, or Zurigan.

Another possibility is that it is derived from Visayan or &quot;suyogao&quot;, meaning &quot;water current&quot;. From &quot;suyog&quot; (also &quot;sulog&quot; or ), &quot;current&quot;; cf. Sinulog, Sulu, and Tausug (Suluk).

==History==

===Early history===
In precolonial times, the region of Surigao was inhabited by the Visayan Surigaonon people in the coastal areas, as well as Lumad groups in the interiors like the Mandaya, Mansaka, Mamanwa and Manobo.

===Spanish colonial era===
During the Spanish Occupation in 1860, six military districts were created in Mindanao, with Surigao and Agusan forming the &quot;East District&quot;. In 1870, the district was renamed to &quot;Distrito de Surigao&quot;.

===American invasion era===
In 1901, Distrito de Surigao became chartered province. Agusan became an independent province in 1907 during the American era, when it was separated from Surigao.

===Philippine independence===
====Foundation====
Surigao del Sur was created as the 56th Philippine province on June 19, 1960, through &quot;Republic Act 2786&quot;, separated from its mother province, Surigao, on September 18, 1960.

At the time of its inception, it was classified as 4th Class province with an annual income of over 300,000.00. Seven years later, because of rapid increase of revenue collection particularly from the logging ventures, it has been reclassified as Ist Class B and in 1980 as Ist Class A with an estimated annual income of around 13,000,000. It has been reclassified as 2nd Class with a revenue adding up to 315,888,300.63.

Recaredo B. Castillo was the appointed first governor and subsequently elected governor while Vicente L. Pimentel was the first elected congressman.

The province was formed with 13 municipalities. Six more were added, raising the number to 19 with Tandag as the capital. Two of its municipalities have been elevated to cities; the first was Bislig City.

===Contemporary===
The capital town Tandag became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9392&quot; which sought to convert the town into a city. The law was ratified on June 23, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

House Bill No. 2336 of the 19th Congress seeks to separate the southern part of the province to be formed as the new Province of Surigao Oriental. Once the bill is signed into law it will be approved and ratified in a referendum.

==Geography==

Surigao del Sur is located along the northeastern coast of Mindanao facing the Philippine Sea between 125°40&#x27; to 126°20&#x27; east longitudes and 7°55&#x27; and 9°20&#x27; north latitudes. It is bounded on the northwest by the province of Surigao del Norte, on the southeast by Davao Oriental, on the west and southwest by Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur.

Situated west is the Diwata Mountain Range, isolating the province from the rest of Mindanao. To the east lies the Philippine Sea. The Mindanao Deep, one of the deepest trenches in the world, is situated a few kilometers east of the coastline.

===Land area===
The land area of the province is representing 27.75 percent of the total land area of Caraga Administrative Region and about 5.14 percent and 1.74 percent of the total land area of Mindanao and Philippines, respectively. The province is elongated in shape, extending from the northeastern portion at Carrascal to the southernmost municipality of Lingig. It is approximately in length and at its widest point which runs from Cagwait to San Miguel.

Municipal-wise, San Miguel has the biggest land area accounting for of the total provincial land area while Bayabas has the smallest constituting only about .

Of the land, only or 32.22 percent are classified as alienable and disposable (A and D) while or 67.78 percent are forest land. Tagbina has the biggest share of alienable and disposable land with or about 56.51 percent of its land area followed by Hinatuan with or 63.56 percent of its land area.

Of the of forest land, are protection forest, production forest, are non-forest agriculture and are for non-forest mining. As of today, the province still has vast areas of remaining old growth and mossy forest.

===Climate===
The province falls under Type II climate of the Philippines, characterized by rainfall distributed throughout the year, although there is a distinct rainy season which begins from the month of November and ends in March. However, the climatic behavior of the province for the past few years has shown variations wherein the onset of the rainy seasons no longer occurs on the usual time. Months with low rainfall are from July to October with September as the driest month. Wet months are from November to June with January as the wettest month.

Surigao del Sur is one of the top 20 most vulnerable provinces to climate change in the Philippines.

===Administrative divisions===
Surigao del Sur comprises 17 municipalities and two cities, further subdivided into 309 barangays. There are two congressional districts encompassing all cities and towns.


==Demographics==
The population of Surigao del Sur in the 2020 census was 642,255 people, with a density of .

The province is home to the Kamayo, Agusan, and the eponymous Surigaonon peoples, with the latter ethnolingustically related to the Visayan ethnic groups (though geographically native in Mindanao). Their dances are showcased in the local festival, &quot;Sirong Festival&quot;, held especially during the town fiesta of Cantilan. The Sirong Festival depicts the early Christianization of the early Cantilan inhabitants where the natives tried to defend their land against Visayan invaders. Other residents in the province include the migrants (and their native-born descendants) from Ilocandia, Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mindoro, Marinduque and Bicolandia in Luzon and Panay, Negros, Central and Western Visayas, as well as Chinese and white Europeans (eg. Spaniards and white Americans) and their native-born descendants.

The indigenous people of the province were largely Christianized during the early times of the Spanish conquest.

===Languages===
The Surigaonon and Tandaganon languages are spoken in most parts of Surigao del Sur (except in Bislig and the towns of Barobo, Hinatuan, Lingig and Tagbina, where most of the inhabitants speak Cebuano and their native Kamayo, a different language but one distantly related to Surigaonon, is spoken by the rest of the population), with the Cantilangnon dialect, a northern variety of Surigaonon that is very much similar to the dialect of Surigaonon as spoken in Surigao del Norte, being spoken mostly in the five northern municipalities of the province, namely Carrascal, Cantilan, Madrid, Carmen and Lanuza (or the municipal cluster called Carcanmadcarlan); these municipalities were once under a single Municipality of Cantilan before December 10, 1918.

Tagalog and English are also widely spoken throughout the province and used as the primary languages of education, business, and administration.

==Economy==
Surigao del Sur is one of the suppliers of rice, bananas and other tropical fruits. Copper, chromite and silver are also found here. Marine and aquaculture are abundant in the province, being primary livelihoods of the inhabitants as the province is well known for producing seafood and sea by-products.

===Mineral resources===
Surigao del Sur is endowed with metallic minerals such as copper, gold, chromite, cobalt, nickel and lead zinc, as well as non-metallic (limestone, coal and feldspar, clay diatomite/bentomite and coarse/fine aggregates). There are small and large scale mining activities in the province. Corporations operating in a large scale are the Marc Ventures Mining Development Corporation at Carrascal and Cantilan, operating in an area of within the Diwata Mountain Range. The [TP Construction and Mining Corporation, also in Carrascal, focuses on gold and nickel mining in an area of and , respectively. The Carac-an Development Corporation, also in Carrascal, has an area of . Small scale mining activities are found in the municipalities of Barobo, Carmen and San Miguel.

==Tourism==
Bislig&#x27;s main tourist attraction is the Tinuy-an Falls, known as the little &quot;Niagara Falls of the Philippines&quot;. It is a white water curtain that flows in three levels about high and wide. Its unique natural formation once appeared in the International Travel Magazine. It is also known as the widest waterfall in the Philippines.

Surfing in Surigao del Sur is widely known and has been one of the local tourist attractions. This extreme sport is often practiced in Cantilan and Lanuza. Skimboarding is also found in several municipalities, attracting tourists.

<text>Kawfakha&#x27; () was a Palestinian village located east of Gaza that was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

==Location==
The village stood on a stretch of sandy, rolling land in the northern Negev. A network of secondary roads linked it to the highways between Gaza and Julis, which ran parallel to the coastal highway.

==History==
Ceramics from the Byzantine era have been found here.

Kawfakha was inhabited in the 15th century. In 1472–1473 CE, Sultan Qaitbay endowed it for the benefit of his Jerusalem madrasa.

===Ottoman era===
In 1838, in the late Ottoman era, &quot;el-Kaufakhah&quot; was noted as a place &quot;in ruins or deserted.&quot;

In 1882, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) noted at &quot;Khurbet el Kofkhah&quot;: &quot;a large site. Rubble cisterns, a marble capital, with acanthus leaves. Scattered stones and pottery.&quot;

Kawfakwa was founded in the late nineteenth century by Gaza city residents who came to cultivate the surrounding land. In its center was a mosque that was well known in the region, built in the reign of the Ottoman sultan Abd al-Hamid II (1876–1909).

===British mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Kufakha&quot; had a population of 203 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 317, still all Muslims, in 56 houses.

The village had an elementary school and some small shops. The villagers obtained water for domestic use from two wells inside the village. The land on the northern side of the village was planted with fruit trees, such as apricots, olives, almonds, grapes and figs. On the other sides of the village grain was grown.


In the 1945 statistics Kawfakha had a population of 500 Muslims, with a total of 8,569 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 97 dunums was irrigated or used for orchards, and 7,768 dunums (of public land) were allotted to cereals, while 41 dunams were built-up, public land.

===1948 and after===
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the villagers of Kawfakha repeatedly asked to surrender, accept Jewish rule and be allowed to stay, all to no avail. Kawfakha, together with al-Muharraqa, was raided by the Palmach&#x27;s Negev Brigade on May 27–28, and the inhabitants of both villages were expelled or driven out. On May 30, a &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent reported that the two villages had been captured.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and the moshav of Nir Akiva was established in 1953 on village lands, southwest of the village site.

According to Khalidi, by 1992 the village remaining structures on the village land were:
&quot;Only the mosque remains, and it is used as a storehouse for animal fodder and as a horse stable. It is a stone structure with arched entrances and windows on all sides; its roof is topped by three shallow domes. The site, which contains piles of rubble and is overgrown with cactuses and other desert plants, has been fenced in and serves as a pasture. There is a citrus grove west of it, and grain is grown by Israeli farmers on part of the surrounding land.&quot;

The village mosque was inspected in 1994, and found to be built of ashlar stones (approximately 0.2m x 0.4 m) with the corners emphasised by a slight offset. At the north-west corner there was a thick square minaret 10–15 meters high with chamfered corners. There are three doorways on the north side, two of which lead into the prayer hall, whilst the east door leads into a separate room. At the time of the inspection, the mosque was used as a storehouse for a nearby farm (&quot;Avi´s Ranch&quot;).

<text>In geometry, Thales&#x27;s theorem states that if , , and are distinct points on a circle where the line is a diameter, the angle is a right angle. Thales&#x27;s theorem is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem and is mentioned and proved as part of the 31st proposition in the third book of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. It is generally attributed to Thales of Miletus, but it is sometimes attributed to Pythagoras.

==History==
Babylonian mathematicians knew this for special cases before Greek mathematicians proved it.

Thales of Miletus (early 6th century BC) is traditionally credited with proving the theorem; however, even by the 5th century BC there was nothing extant of Thales&#x27; writing, and inventions and ideas were attributed to men of wisdom such as Thales and Pythagoras by later doxographers based on hearsay and speculation. Reference to Thales was made by Proclus (5th century AD), and by Diogenes Laërtius (3rd century AD) documenting Pamphila&#x27;s (1st century AD) statement that Thales &quot;was the first to inscribe in a circle a right-angle triangle&quot;.

Thales was claimed to have traveled to Egypt and Babylonia, where he is supposed to have learned about geometry and astronomy and thence brought their knowledge to the Greeks, along the way inventing the concept of geometric proof and proving various geometric theorems. However, there is no direct evidence for any of these claims, and they were most likely invented speculative rationalizations. Modern scholars believe that Greek deductive geometry as found in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; was not developed until the 4th century BC, and any geometric knowledge Thales may have had would have been observational.

The theorem appears in Book III of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; () as proposition 31: &quot;In a circle the angle in the semicircle is right, that in a greater segment less than a right angle, and that in a less segment greater than a right angle; further the angle of the greater segment is greater than a right angle, and the angle of the less segment is less than a right angle.&quot;

Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot; (canto 13, lines 101–102) refers to Thales&#x27;s theorem in the course of a speech.

== Proof ==

===First proof===
The following facts are used: the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to 180° and the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.
Since , and are isosceles triangles, and by the equality of the base angles of an isosceles triangle, and .

Let and . The three internal angles of the triangle are , , and . Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to 180°, we have

:formula_1

Q.E.D.

===Second proof===
The theorem may also be proven using trigonometry: Let , , and . Then is a point on the unit circle . We will show that forms a right angle by proving that and are perpendicular — that is, the product of their slopes is equal to −1. We calculate the slopes for and :

:formula_2

Then we show that their product equals −1:

: formula_3

Note the use of the Pythagorean trigonometric identity formula_4

===Third proof===

Let be a triangle in a circle where is a diameter in that circle. Then construct a new triangle by mirroring over the line and then mirroring it again over the line perpendicular to which goes through the center of the circle. Since lines and are parallel, likewise for and , the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Since lines and , the diagonals of the parallelogram, are both diameters of the circle and therefore have equal length, the parallelogram must be a rectangle. All angles in a rectangle are right angles.

==Converse==

For any triangle, and, in particular, any right triangle, there is exactly one circle containing all three vertices of the triangle. This circle is called the circumcircle of the triangle.

The locus of points equidistant from two given points is a straight line that is called the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the points. The perpendicular bisectors of any two sides of a triangle intersect in exactly one point. This point must be equidistant from the vertices of the triangle.
One way of formulating Thales&#x27;s theorem is: if the center of a triangle&#x27;s circumcircle lies on the triangle then the triangle is right, and the center of its circumcircle lies on its hypotenuse.

The converse of Thales&#x27;s theorem is then: the center of the circumcircle of a right triangle lies on its hypotenuse. (Equivalently, a right triangle&#x27;s hypotenuse is a diameter of its circumcircle.)

===Proof of the converse using geometry===
This proof consists of &#x27;completing&#x27; the right triangle to form a rectangle and noticing that the center of that rectangle is equidistant from the vertices and so is the center of the circumscribing circle of the original triangle, it utilizes two facts:

*adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (add to 180°) and,
*the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and cross each other in their median point.

Let there be a right angle , a line parallel to passing by , and a line parallel to passing by . Let be the point of intersection of lines and . (It has not been proven that lies on the circle.)

The quadrilateral forms a parallelogram by construction (as opposite sides are parallel). Since in a parallelogram adjacent angles are supplementary (add to 180°) and is a right angle (90°) then angles are also right (90°); consequently is a rectangle.

Let be the point of intersection of the diagonals and . Then the point , by the second fact above, is equidistant from , , and . And so is center of the circumscribing circle, and the hypotenuse of the triangle () is a diameter of the circle.

===Alternate proof of the converse using geometry===
Given a right triangle with hypotenuse , construct a circle whose diameter is . Let be the center of . Let be the intersection of and the ray . By Thales&#x27;s theorem, is right. But then must equal . (If lies inside , would be obtuse, and if lies outside , would be acute.)

===Proof of the converse using linear algebra===
This proof utilizes two facts:
*two lines form a right angle if and only if the dot product of their directional vectors is zero, and
*the square of the length of a vector is given by the dot product of the vector with itself.
Let there be a right angle and circle with as a diameter.
Let M&#x27;s center lie on the origin, for easier calculation.
Then we know
*, because the circle centered at the origin has as diameter, and
*, because is a right angle.
It follows
:formula_5

This means that and are equidistant from the origin, i.e. from the center of . Since lies on , so does , and the circle is therefore the triangle&#x27;s circumcircle.

The above calculations in fact establish that both directions of Thales&#x27;s theorem are valid in any inner product space.

==Generalizations and related results==
As stated above, Thales&#x27;s theorem is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem (the proof of which is quite similar to the first proof of Thales&#x27;s theorem given above):
:Given three points , and on a circle with center , the angle is twice as large as the angle .
A related result to Thales&#x27;s theorem is the following:

*If is a diameter of a circle, then:
:*If is inside the circle, then 
:*If is on the circle, then 
:*If is outside the circle, then .

==Applications==
===Constructing a tangent to a circle passing through a point===

Thales&#x27;s theorem can be used to construct the tangent to a given circle that passes through a given point. In the figure at right, given circle with centre and the point outside , bisect at and draw the circle of radius with centre . is a diameter of this circle, so the triangles connecting OP to the points and where the circles intersect are both right triangles.

===Finding the centre of a circle===
Thales&#x27;s theorem can also be used to find the centre of a circle using an object with a right angle, such as a set square or rectangular sheet of paper larger than the circle. The angle is placed anywhere on its circumference (figure 1). The intersections of the two sides with the circumference define a diameter (figure 2). Repeating this with a different set of intersections yields another diameter (figure 3). The centre is at the intersection of the diameters.

<text>Suhmata (), was a Palestinian village, located northeast of Acre. It was depopulated by the Golani Brigade during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

==History==
Separated from the neighboring village of Tarshiha by a deep gorge, the ruins of a Byzantine era church lay within Suhmata&#x27;s village lands. Underground water reservoir and a burial cave that apparently dates to the Roman period have been found at the village site. Suhmata had a Christian population at least until the Persian invasion of Palestine (A.D. 614–627) and presumably many people remained Christian for some time after that. What was earlier termed a Crusader-era castle constructed in the village, which was rebuilt by Zahir al-Umar in the latter half of the 18th century, turned out to be the Byzantine church. Excavations in 1932 revealed an inscription in the church&#x27;s mosaic floor that dates to 555 CE.

The Crusaders referred to the village as &quot;Samueth&quot; or &quot;Samahete&quot;. In 1179, Baldwin IV confirmed the sale from Viscountess Petronella of Acre of houses, vineyards and gardens in Samueth, the village of Suphie, and some houses in Castellum Regis to Count Jocelyn III, uncle of Baldwin IV, for 4,500 bezants. However, Ronnie Ellenblum writes that it is unlikely that there was actual Frankish settlement in Suhmata at this time.

===Ottoman era===
in the 1548/9 Ottoman tax records, it. was noted that &quot;Suhm-wata&quot; (grid-number 178/267) paid a tax on 4 olive oil presses.

In the Ottoman era, in 1838, Suhmata was found to be a village with a mixed population of Christians and Muslims, located in the el-Jebel district, west of Safad.

In 1875, Victor Guérin visited Suhmata, and noted that &quot;the village [is] divided into two distinct quarters, occupies two hills near each other, between which is a great pond (birke), partly cut in the rock and partly built. One of these hills is crowned by the remains of a fortress flanked by towers and built with simple rubble; it contained several subterranean magazines, a mosque, and various chambers. The foundation is attributed to Dhaher el Amer. It is now three parts demolished, and on the place where it stood grow vines and tobacco.&quot;

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described it as &quot;a village, built of stone, containing about 400 Moslems, situated on [a] ridge and [the] slope of [a] hill, surrounded by figs, olives and arable land; there are several cisterns and a spring near.

An elementary school for boys was founded in the village in 1886. A population list from about 1887 showed &quot;Sahmata&quot; to have about 1,500 inhabitants; 1,400 Muslims and 100 Christians.

===British Mandate era===
During the Mandatory Palestine, an agricultural school was established. The schools, a mosque, a church, two rain-fed irrigation pools, existed up until 1948.

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Submata&quot; had a population of 632; 589 Muslims and 43 Melkite Christians, increasing in the 1931 census to 796; 752 Muslims and 44 Christians, in a total of 175 houses.

Over 70 percent of the village land was rocky and uncultivated, covered with oak and wild pears. The agricultural land was planted with wheat, barley, maize, tobacco, and vegetables. Suhmata&#x27;s tobacco had a reputation for quality.

In the 1945 statistics, Suhmata had a population of 1,130; 1060 Muslims and 70 Christians, with a total of 17,056 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 3,290 dunums was allocated to cereals; 1,901 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while 135 dunams were built-up (urban) area.

===Israeli period===
During Operation Hiram, on 28 October 1948, the village was bombed from the air. On 30 October, the First Battalion of Israel&#x27;s Golani Brigade assaulted the village, resulting in its depopulation. The village was left in ruins.

A naming committee established by the Jewish National Fund, which operated from 1948 to 1951 until its incorporation into a Governmental Naming Committee set up by Israel, renamed Suhmata &quot;Hosen&quot;, meaning &quot;Strength.&quot; Meron Benvenisti writes that the committee chose this symbolic new name after determining that there was no known Jewish historical connection to the village of Suhmata.

In 1992 the village site was described: &quot;The site is covered with debris and broken walls from fallen stone houses, all of which are scattered among the olive trees that grow there. A castle and a wall that were probably built by the Crusaders still stand. The castle is on an elevated spot on the eastern side of the site, and the wall encloses the western quarter. The surrounding lands are partly forested and partly used as pasture.&quot;

Suhmata&#x27;s former inhabitants founded a village committee in 1993 which organizes volunteer efforts. The village committee also conducted a survey of the displaced population from Suhmata and their distribution inside Israel. The village was also the focus of the 1996 play &quot;Sahmatah&quot; by Hanna Eady and Ed Mast.

<text>al-Bassa () was a Palestinian Arab village in the Mandatory Palestine&#x27;s Acre Subdistrict. It was situated close to the Lebanese border, north of the district capital, Acre, and above sea level.

During the 1948 Palestine War the village was stormed by Haganah troops in May 1948 and almost completely razed. Its residents were either internally displaced or expelled to neighboring countries as part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion. Today, the ruins of the village are in the northern quarters of the moshav of Shlomi.

==Etymology==
Adolf Neubauer &quot;proposed to identify this place with the Batzet of the Talmud&quot;. It was called &quot;Bezeth&quot; during the Roman period, and its Arabic name is &quot;al-Basah&quot;. In the period of Crusader rule in Palestine, it was known as &quot;Le Bace&quot; or &quot;LeBassa&quot;. Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani (d. 1201), a chronicler and advisor to Saladin, referred to the village as &quot;Ayn al-Bassa&quot;, &quot; &#x27;Ayn&quot; meaning &#x27;spring&#x27; in Arabic.

==History==
The site shows signs of habitation in prehistory and the Middle Bronze Age. 

An ancient Christian burial place and 18 other archaeological sites were located in the village.

===Roman and Byzantine empires ===
A Jewish settlement stood at the site between 70 and 425 CE. Blown glass pitchers uncovered in a tomb in al-Bassa were dated to circa 396 CE. 

&quot;The Survey of Western Palestine&quot;, sponsored by the Palestine Exploration Fund, identified al-Bassa as, &quot;probably a Crusading village&quot;; however, archaeological excavations only uncovered architectural evidence of an ecclesiastical farm in operation there between the 5th to 8th centuries.

===Crusader period===
Although pottery sherds found by archaeologists indicate continuous habitation throughout the Middle Ages, no Crusader-period architectural remains were discovered yet as of 1997. A capital decorated with a cross once dated to the Crusader period was later re-dated to the Byzantine period.

The site was used in 1189 C.E. as a Crusader encampment during a military campaign, and a document dated October 1200 recorded the sale of the village by King Amalric II of Jerusalem to the Teutonic Order. A-Bassa was the first village listed as part of the domain of the Crusaders during the hudna (Islamic ceasefire) between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur (Qalawun) in 1283.

===Ottoman Empire===
In 1596, al-Bassa was part of the Ottoman Empire, a village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the Safad Sanjak, with a population of 76 Muslim families and 28 Muslim bachelors. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat olives, barley, cotton and fruits, as well as on goats, beehives and pasture land; a total of 7,000 Akçe.

In the 18th century, al-Bassa became a zone of contention between Zahir al-Umar and the chiefs of Jabal Amil under Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar, while under his successor, Jezzar Pasha, al-Bassa was made the administrative center of the &quot;nahiya&quot; in around 1770. In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte described al-Bassa as a village of 600 Metawalis. A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of that year showed the place, named as &quot;El Basa.&quot;

The European explorer Van de Velde visited &quot;el-Bussa&quot; in 1851, and stayed with the sheikh, Aisel Yusuf, writing that &quot;The clean house of Sheck Yusuf is a welcome sight, and the verdant meadows around the village are truly refreshing to the eye&quot;. He further noted that &quot;The inhabitants of Bussah are almost all members of the Greek Church. A few Musselmans live among them, and a few fellahs of a Bedouin tribe which wanders about in the neighborhood are frequently seen in the street.&quot;

In 1863, the village was visited by Henry Baker Tristram who described it as a Christian village, where &quot;olive oil, goats´hair, and tobacco, seemed to be principal produce of the district; the latter being exported in some quantities, by way of Acre, to Egypt. Bee-keeping, also, is not an unimportant item of industry, and every house possesses a pile of bee-hives in its yard.&quot;


In the late 19th century, the village of Al-Bassa was described as being built of stone, situated on the edge of a plain, surrounded by large groves of olives and gardens of pomegranate, figs and apples. The village had about 1,050 residents.

The village had a public elementary school for boys (built by the Ottomans in 1882), a private secondary school, and a public elementary school for girls.

A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;el Basseh&quot; had 1,960 inhabitants; one third Muslim, and two thirds Greek Catholic Christians.

===British Mandate===

The Franco-British boundary agreement of 1920 described an imprecisely defined boundary between Lebanon and Palestine. It appeared to pass close to the north of al-Bassa, leaving the village on the Palestinian side but cut off from much of its lands. However the French government included al-Bassa in a Lebanese census of 1921 and granted citizenship to its residents. Meanwhile, a joint British-French boundary commission was working to determine a precise border, making many adjustments in the process. By February 1922 it had determined a border that confirmed al-Bassa as being in Palestine. This became official in 1923. In 1922, the people of al-Bassa founded a local council which was responsible for managing its local affairs. The citizenship of the residents was changed to Palestinian in 1926.

The British census of September 1922 listed a population of 867 Christians, 366 &quot;Mohammedans&quot;, 150 Metawilehs, and 1 Jew. The Christians were listed as Greek Catholic (Melchite) (721), Orthodox (120), Church of England (17), Armenian Catholic (8), and one Roman Catholic. Asher Kaufman described the village as being &quot;split between Sunnis and Greek Catholics&quot;. At the 1931 census, which did not distinguish Metawalis from other Muslims, the village had 868 Muslims, 1076 Christians, and 4 Bahais.

The 1938 camp of Jewish labourers and Notrim (police) for construction of Tegart&#x27;s wall was located adjacent to the village, and it ultimately became the site of a Tegart fort. By 1945 the village was home to a regional college.

The village&#x27;s main economic activity was olive picking. Important public structures at the time of its existence included two mosques, two churches, three schools and 18 other shrines both holy to Muslims and Christians. Al-Bassa was the only Palestinian village in the Galilee with a Christian high school. Some of Bassa&#x27;s former public structures have been preserved and are found today within the Israeli localities of Shlomi and Betzet.

====Arab Revolt and 1938 massacre====

On 7 September 1938 a massacre of Palestinian Arabs was perpetrated by the British Army in the village. The massacre was committed as a part of British efforts to suppress the 1936-1939 Arab Revolt in Palestine, and was conducted by a company of the Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR) and a detachment of the 11th Hussars. The village was razed and about 50 Arabs from the village were collected by the RUR and some attached Royal Engineers. Some who tried to run away were shot. Then, according to British testimony, the remainder were put onto a bus which was forced to drive over a land mine laid by the soldiers, destroying the bus and killing many of the occupants. The village&#x27;s inhabitants were then forced to dig a pit and throw all the remnants of the maimed bodies into it. Arab accounts reported torture and other brutality. At least 20 Palestinians were killed in the attack.

The village of al-Bassa was targeted as a punitive reprisal operation after four Royal Ulster Rifles soldiers were killed and two seriously wounded by a landmine on September 6th. Professor Mark McGovern of Edge Hill University states that the attack on al-Bassa was part of a pattern of British counterinsurgency tactics:

&quot;Nor was the massacre at al-Bassa an isolated incident. Rather, it was part of a much wider policy of ‘reprisals’ that marked the British Mandate’s repression of the Arab Revolt. As conflict escalated this official reprisals policy saw houses blown up, or groups of houses demolished, property looted, food stores systematically destroyed, forced labour, ‘punitive village occupations’, the imposition of crushing collective fines and wholesale destruction of ‘bad villages’. Torture centres were set up and many Arab prisoners shot ‘while trying to escape’. ‘Special Night Squads’, consisting of British and Jewish settler policemen and moving at night (often disguised as Arabs) terrorised Arab villages, humiliating and killing Arab civilians.&quot;

In 2022, a Nablus businessman, Munib al-Masri (88) who was shot by British troops in 1944, after an independent review of documentation by two international legal scholars, Luis Moreno Ocampo and Ben Emmerson, stated that he would present the British government with a 300 page dossier on this and other incidents, seeking accountability and a formal apology for abuses during the period of the British mandate.

====1940s====
Al-Bassa was one of the largest, most developed villages in the north of the country, covering a land area of some 20,000 dunams of hills and plains, 2,000 of which were irrigated. A regional commercial center, it contained over sixty shops and eleven coffeehouses, a few of which sat along the Haifa-Beirut highway. The active village council had paved roads, installed a system of running water, and oversaw the convening of a wholesale produce market there every Sunday. An agricultural cooperative in the village counted over 150 members that promoted agricultural development, while also providing loans to local farmers. The population of about 4,000 was divided almost evenly between Muslims and Christians. Among the village institutions were a government run elementary school, a &quot;National High School&quot;, a Greek Orthodox church, a Catholic church, and a mosque. The village was situated in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. 

In the 1945 statistics, the population had grown to 2,950; 1360 Muslims and 1590 Christians, with of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, Arabs used 614 dunams for citrus and bananas, 14,699 dunams were plantations and irrigable land; 10,437 were used for cereals, while 132 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===1948 Palestine war===


Al-Bassa was captured by paramilitary Haganah forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in Operation Ben-Ami, on May 14, 1948. Al-Bassa&#x27;s defenders were local militia men. Following its capture, the Haganah&#x27;s Palmach forces concentrated the villagers in the local church where they shot and killed a number of youths before chasing the villagers out. One witness to the expulsion said that it was preceded by soldiers shooting and killing five villagers inside the church, while another said seven villagers were shot and killed by soldiers outside the church.

Al-Bassa&#x27;s residents were expelled as part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, and the village was completely destroyed by the Israelis with the exception of a few houses, a church, and a Muslim shrine.

At least 60 of the Christian villagers of Al-Bassa were taken by the Haganah to Mazra&#x27;a, where they remained for more than a year. Altogether 81 residents of al-Bassa became Israeli citizens as internally displaced Palestinians who lost their land rights and ended up in places like Nazareth. The only day on which Palestinians did not require a permit to travel during that period was Israel&#x27;s Independence Day. On this day internally displaced Palestinians would visit their former villages. Wakim Wakim, an attorney from Al-Bassa and a leading member of the Association for the Defense of the Rights of the Internally Displaced explains: &quot;The day when Israel celebrates is the day we mourn.&quot;

Most of the former villagers of al-Bassa (circa 95%) were pushed north towards Lebanon, concentrating in the Dbayeh refugee camp near Jounieh east of Beirut. Prior to and during the Lebanese Civil War, this camp suffered severe damage in the fighting and was largely destroyed, though it still has a population of some 4,233 people who are mostly Palestinian Christian refugees. Other former residents of Al-Bassa and the refugee camp in Lebanon ended up in Lansing, Michigan where they established an international village club and hold annual gatherings attended by over 300 people.

The site was repopulated by Jewish immigrants and renamed as Betzet in 1951, and is today a part of the State of Israel.

The village was inspected in 1992, when it was found that although most of the houses of Al-Bassa had been destroyed, a number of historic buildings survived, including two churches, a mosque, and a maqam.

==Landmarks==
===Mosque===
According to Petersen, the mosque appears to be a relatively modern construct, probably built in the early 1900s. It consists of a tall square room with a flat roof supported by iron girders. There is a cylindrical minaret at the north-east corner. There are tall pointed windows on all four sides, and a mihrab in the middle of the south wall. At the time of the inspection, 1992, the building was used as a sheep pen.

===Maqam===
The maqam is located about 20 meters east of the mosque. It consists of two parts: a walled courtyard, and a domed prayer room. In the courtyard there is a mihrab in the south wall, and a doorway in the east wall leads into the main prayer room. Pendentives springing from four thick piers support wide arches and the dome. In the middle of the south wall there is a mihrab, next to a simple minbar, made of four stone steps.

===Khirbet Ma&#x27;sub===
The site of Khirbet Ma&#x27;sub, immediately to the east of Bassa, is where the Phoenician Ma&#x27;sub inscription was found in the 1880s.

==Culture==
Henry Baker Tristram during his 1863 visit to the village made a detailed description of the women&#x27;s Palestinian costumes.


Weir, after quoting what Tristram wrote about the head-dresses in Al-Bussah, notes that coin headdresses went out of use for daily wear in Galilee at the beginning of the 20th century, but continued to be worn by brides for their weddings.

<text>Al-Birwa (, also spelled &quot;al-Birweh&quot;) was a Palestinian Arab village, located east of Acre (Akka). In 1945, it had a population of 1,460, of whom the majority were Muslims and a significant minority, Christians. Its total land area consisted of 13,542 dunams (13.5 square kilometers). The village was depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

The settlement at Al-Birwa was started in the Roman era, and reached a peak in the Byzantine era. In the mid-11th century CE Al-Birwa was mentioned by the Persian geographer Nasir Khusraw and it was known to the Crusaders as &quot;Broet&quot;. The village came under Mamluk rule in the late 13th century, and in the early 16th century, it was conquered by the Ottomans, who ruled it for four centuries. Travelers&#x27; reports from the late 19th century documented that al-Birwa had a mosque, a church and an elementary school for boys (a girls&#x27; school was built in 1942).

During British Mandate rule in Palestine, al-Birwa was home to local power brokers, who mediated disputes in neighboring villages. Al-Birwa became a center of rebel operations during the 1936–1939 revolt against British rule. By the 1940s, many of the village&#x27;s agrarian inhabitants lost their lands due to debt, and shifted to labor jobs in nearby cities, such as Haifa. However, the majority of the residents—men and women—continued to engage in farming, selling their olives, grains and other crops in the markets of Acre. Al-Birwa was captured by the Israelis in early June 1948, after which its local militia recaptured the village. Al-Birwa was then permanently occupied by the Israelis in late June. Afterward, its inhabitants, including future Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, fled to nearby villages or Lebanon. The Jewish communities of Yas&#x27;ur and Ahihud were established on al-Birwa&#x27;s lands in 1949 and 1950, respectively.

==Geography==
Al-Birwa stood on a rocky hill overlooking the plain of Acre, with an average elevation of 60 meters above sea level. It was situated at the intersection of two highways—one led to Acre and the other towards Haifa. Located 10.5 kilometers east of Acre, the other nearest localities to al-Birwa included al-Damun (depopulated in 1948) to the south, and the Arab towns of Jadeidi to the northwest, Julis to the north, Sha&#x27;ab to the east, and Majd al-Kurum to the northeast.

Al-Birwa&#x27;s total land area consisted of 13,542 dunams (13.42 hectares), of which 59 dunams were built-up areas. Cultivable land accounted for 77% of the total land area. Orchards were planted on 1,548 dunams of which 1,500 were used for olive groves, and 8,457 dunams were allotted to grains. The residents of the town sold 536 dunams to Jews, and most of the rest was Arab-owned.

===Archaeology===
Several excavation has been conducted at the site of al-Birwa after year 2000. Finds included a large building, numerous potsherds from the Late Roman period, a bronze coin from the 1st or 2nd century CE, remains of an ancient olive press, glass vessels such as a wine goblet and bottles dated to the Late Byzantine and Umayyad periods (7th and first half of 8th centuries CE) and an underground water reservoir. A few potsherds from the Crusader and Mamluk periods were also found.

In 2008, the remains of a large olive oil refinery dating from the Byzantine era was uncovered, together with items belonging to a church. The excavators believed that the olive press could be situated inside a Byzantine monastery.

==History==
===Antiquity===
The more ancient site, &quot;Tel Birwa&quot; (variant: &quot;Tel Berweh&quot;), lies about one mile southwest of the Arab village by the same name, and is said to be a mound measuring 600 paces in circumference at the top, and 75 feet high. The mound abounds with Graeco-Roman potsherds, showing that it was occupied down to Roman times when it was abandoned, as no distinctively Arab pottery could be found there. Conder and Kitchener thought that Al-Birwa preserves in its name the more ancient name of &quot;Beri&quot; (), mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Pesahim&quot; iv.1 [26a]), seeing that both it and Kabul are mentioned together. According to Josephus, the villages in the immediate vicinity of Kabul were pillaged and burnt during the First Jewish revolt against Rome.

=== Middle Ages ===
Al-Birwa was mentioned in 1047 CE, during Fatimid rule, when it was visited by the Persian geographer, Nasir Khusraw. He describes it as lying &quot;between Acre and Damun&quot;, and reports having visited what he described as the tombs of Simeon and Esau there. The Crusaders wrested control of Palestine from the Fatimids in 1099. They referred to al-Birwa as &quot;Broet&quot;. In 1253, John Aleman, the Crusader lord of Caesarea, sold al-Birwa, along with several other villages, to the Knights Hospitaller. Al-Birwa was mentioned as part of the Acre-based Crusaders&#x27; domain in the 1283 &quot;hudna&quot; (truce agreement) with the Mamluks under Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun. In the late 13th century, the Mamluks defeated and conquered the last Crusader outposts along Palestine&#x27;s northern coastline.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Al-Birwa came under Ottoman rule in 1517, along with all of Palestine. In 1596, al-Birwa was a small village in the Akka Nahiya (Subdistrict of Acre), part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). The village paid taxes on wheat, barley, fruit, beehives, and goats. According to Ottoman tax registers, al-Birwa had 121 residents in 1596. A map from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 by French cartographer Pierre Jacotin depicted al-Birwa as &quot;Beroweh&quot;, though its location on the map was misplaced.

In the late 19th century, al-Birwa grew to be a large village, with a well in its southern area. To the north lay &quot;beautiful olive-groves and fruitful wheatfields,&quot; as they were described by one Western traveller to the region in the mid-19th century. American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited al-Birwa in 1852 and noted that it was one of 18 villages in Palestine with an operating Christian (Eastern Orthodox) church. By 1859, British Consul Edward T. Rogers recorded that al-Birwa had approximately 900 inhabitants. The French explorer, Victor Guérin, who visited in 1875, described the Christians of Birwa as Greek Orthodox, and noted that they had a &quot;fairly new&quot; church.

A population list from about 1887 showed that al-Birwa had about 755 inhabitant, of whom 650 were Muslims and 105 were Christians. In 1888, the Ottomans built an elementary school for boys.

=== British Mandate ===
In 1917, during World War I, British forces drove out the Ottomans from Palestine and in 1920, the British Mandate of Palestine was established. In the 1922 British census, al-Birwa had a population of 807, consisting of 735 Muslims and 72 Christians. The Christians were mostly Orthodox with five Anglicans. By the 1931 census, the population had increased to 996, of which 884 were Muslims and 92 were Christians, living in a total of 224 houses. Cement roofs became widely used in al-Birwa in the 1930s, during a time of significant expansion in the village.

A number of al-Birwa&#x27;s inhabitants participated in the 1936–1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine. A commander of the revolt for the Nazareth-Tiberias region, Sheikh Yihya Hawash, was from al-Birwa. He was arrested by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment. The British also executed eight residents of al-Birwa who had participated in the revolt. Other rebel commanders and participants in the revolt from al-Birwa included Asad Atallah, Mahmoud al-Joudi, Saleh Mahmoud Me&#x27;ari-Abu Sa&#x27;ud, Abd al-Hamid Daher Me&#x27;ari, Muhammad al-Hajj Ali, Yusef Taha, Fadil Eid, Yousif Mai and Abbas al-Shattawi. A number of women from al-Birwa participated in the revolt by transporting arms, water and food to rebels positioned among the hills in the vicinity. Elderly refugees from al-Birwa interviewed in 2003–2004 recalled that during the revolt, local rebels set off a mine that hit a British military jeep on a road adjacent to al-Birwa in August 1937, prompting the British to launch punitive measures against the village. These included gathering men from al-Birwa and forcing them to cut cactus plants near Acre and then placing the men on top of the cactuses, leaving the women of the village to tend to their wounds.

In the 1945 statistics, al-Birwa&#x27;s population was 1,460, of which 130 were Christians. Prominent families and landowners in the village included the Saad, Darwish, Abdullah, Kayyal, Sakkas, al-Wakid, al-Joudi, Najm, al-Dabdoub, Khalid, Akawi, Hissian, Hawash and al-Sheikha families. Socio-economic status in the village was largely determined by land ownership. About 140 residents of the village were tenant farmers who worked for the major landowning Moughrabi, al-Zayyat and Adlabi families. According to intelligence gathered by the Haganah (a Jewish paramilitary organization in Palestine), the traditional, local power brokers of the central Galilee were residents of al-Birwa, who &quot;resolved all conflicts in the nearby villages&quot;. Haganah intelligence also reported that al-Birwa&#x27;s inhabitants were &quot;long-lived, the majority reaching an age of over 100 years&quot;.

By the 1940s, al-Birwa had three olive oil presses, a mosque, a church, and approximately 300 houses. In addition to the Ottoman-era boys&#x27; school, an elementary school for girls was established in 1943. By this time, many of the inhabitants lost all or part of their lands due to debts, and concurrently, men and women from al-Birwa increasingly worked in public projects, such as road construction and the Haifa oil refinery, or in British military installations, to compensate for lost income. However, the main source of income remained agriculture, and the village&#x27;s principal crops were olives, wheat, barley, corn, sesame, and watermelons. In 1944–45, residents of the village owned a total of 600 cattle, 3,000 goats and 1,000 chickens. Women, particularly young women from smaller landowning families, participated alongside the men of their family in working the land, while many women from landless families drew income as seasonal workers on other village residents&#x27; lands. There were general, gender-based divisions of labor, with women collecting well water, raising livestock, curdling milk, transporting goods to markets in Acre and collecting herbs; men typically plowed and sowed seeds, and both men and women picked olives and harvested crops.

=== Israel ===
Israeli forces from the Carmeli Brigade first captured al-Birwa and positions overlooking it on 11 June 1948 as part of Operation Ben-Ami, a day before the first truce of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, 45 elderly residents hid in the church with the priest. The defenders of the village surrendered after losing men and running out of ammunition. The residents took refuge in nearby villages for thirteen days. Nevertheless, clashes continued during the truce. According to local militiamen from al-Birwa, 96 men from the village armed with rifles, and an equal number of men armed with non-firearms and unarmed women assembled near the front lines of the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). The rifle-armed force charged first across the front lines, followed by the men armed with axes, shovels, and sticks, and then the women who carried water to assist the wounded. Al-Birwa&#x27;s ad hoc militia took the small force of Haganah soldiers (who became part of the Israel Defense Forces on 26 May) by surprise and forced them back a kilometer west of al-Birwa. Afterward, al-Birwa&#x27;s residents harvested their crops. They remained in the village until 24 June, when ALA commanders suggested that they join their families in the nearby villages. The militiamen claimed that the ALA stood by during the clashes because they did not receive orders from their superiors.

The Israelis announced that they had battled ALA units in the area, inflicting 100 casualties on 25 June. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that there was fighting in the village for two days and that United Nations (UN) observers were there investigating truce violations. It added that &quot;a small Israeli garrison held al-Birwa prior to the [first] truce&quot;, but it fell to ALA troops based in Nazareth who launched a surprise attack. Some residents camped in the outskirts of the village and occasionally managed to enter and gather personal belongings. After the end of the first truce in mid-July, al-Birwa was captured by Israel during Operation Dekel. The ALA fought the Israelis to recapture al-Birwa, but by 18 July, the village was firmly behind Israeli lines.

On 20 August 1948, the Jewish National Fund called for building a settlement on some of al-Birwa&#x27;s lands, and on 6 January 1949, Yas&#x27;ur, a kibbutz, was established there. In 1950, the moshav of Ahihud was inaugurated on the village&#x27;s western lands. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, one of al-Birwa&#x27;s schools, two shrines for local sages, and three houses remained standing as of 1982. One of the shrines was domed and built of stone. Most of the structures stood amid cacti, weeds, olive and fig groves, and mulberry trees. Most of al-Birwa&#x27;s inhabitants fled to nearby Arab towns and villages, including Tamra, Kabul, Jadeidi, Kafr Yasif, and other localities. In Jadeidi the refugees of al-Birwa mostly resided in a neighborhood called al-Barawneh after their village of origin or alternatively al-Kayyali after the Kayyal family, many of whom lived in the neighborhood and one of whom, Afif Kayyal, was elected mayor in the 1990s and in 2003. Some fled to Lebanon, and ended up in the Shatila refugee camp, in the outskirts of Beirut, where Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal interviewed them in 1973. Among the refugees of al-Birwa was Mahmoud Darwish, who was born in the village in 1941 and lived part of his childhood there.

In 1950, Tawfik Toubi, an Arab member of the Knesset, raised the issue of the internally displaced refugees of al-Birwa in the Knesset, demanding that they be allowed to return to their homes. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion replied in the negative, stating, &quot;The questioner presented the facts inaccurately. Birwa is an abandoned village which was destroyed in the fighting. Its inhabitants cooperated with Kaukji&#x27;s gangs. The Israel Defense Forces and the government did not treat them as they deserved, but permitted them to remain in villages near Birwa, and to become residents of Israel. The government of Israel treats them as it does the other residents of Israel and those lacking means of subsistence. A special body was established to deal with these refugees, to resettle and rehabilitate them, not necessarily in their former villages, and the resettlement of the refugees in Nazareth has already begun.&quot; In December 1951, the village site was declared a closed military zone.

Al-Birwa is among the Palestinian villages for which commemorative Marches of Return have taken place, typically as part of Nakba Day, such as the demonstrations organized by the Association for the Defence of the Rights of the Internally Displaced.

<text>Synthetic geometry (sometimes referred to as axiomatic geometry or even pure geometry) is geometry without the use of coordinates. It relies on the axiomatic method for proving all results from a few basic properties initially called postulates, and at present called axioms. 

After the 17th-century introduction by René Descartes of the coordinate method, which was called analytic geometry, the term &quot;synthetic geometry&quot; was coined to refer to the older methods that were, before Descartes, the only known ones.

According to Felix Klein

Synthetic geometry is that which studies figures as such, without recourse to formulae, whereas analytic geometry consistently makes use of such formulae as can be written down after the adoption of an appropriate system of coordinates.
The first systematic approach for synthetic geometry is Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. However, it appeared at the end of the 19th century that Euclid&#x27;s postulates were not sufficient for characterizing geometry. The first complete axiom system for geometry was given only at the end of the 19th century by David Hilbert. At the same time, it appeared that both synthetic methods and analytic methods can be used to build geometry. The fact that the two approaches are equivalent has been proved by Emil Artin in his book &quot;Geometric Algebra&quot;.

Because of this equivalence, the distinction between synthetic and analytic geometry is no more in use, except at elementary level, or for geometries that are not related to any sort of numbers, such as some finite geometries and non-Desarguesian geometry.

==Logical synthesis==
The process of logical synthesis begins with some arbitrary but definite starting point. This starting point is the introduction of primitive notions or primitives and axioms about these primitives:
* Primitives are the most basic ideas. Typically they include both objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things such as &quot;points&quot;, &quot;lines&quot; and &quot;planes&quot;, while a fundamental relationship is that of &quot;incidence&quot; – of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. Hilbert once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs, the point being that the primitive terms are just empty placeholders and have no intrinsic properties.
* Axioms are statements about these primitives; for example, &quot;any two points are together incident with just one line&quot; (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are the &quot;building blocks&quot; of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.

From a given set of axioms, synthesis proceeds as a carefully constructed logical argument. When a significant result is proved rigorously, it becomes a theorem.

===Properties of axiom sets===
There is no fixed axiom set for geometry, as more than one consistent set can be chosen. Each such set may lead to a different geometry, while there are also examples of different sets giving the same geometry. With this plethora of possibilities, it is no longer appropriate to speak of &quot;geometry&quot; in the singular.

Historically, Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate has turned out to be independent of the other axioms. Simply discarding it gives absolute geometry, while negating it yields hyperbolic geometry. Other consistent axiom sets can yield other geometries, such as projective, elliptic, spherical or affine geometry.

Axioms of continuity and &quot;betweenness&quot; are also optional, for example, discrete geometries may be created by discarding or modifying them.

Following the Erlangen program of Klein, the nature of any given geometry can be seen as the connection between symmetry and the content of the propositions, rather than the style of development.

==History==
Euclid&#x27;s original treatment remained unchallenged for over two thousand years, until the simultaneous discoveries of the non-Euclidean geometries by Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky and Riemann in the 19th century led mathematicians to question Euclid&#x27;s underlying assumptions.

One of the early French analysts summarized synthetic geometry this way:
:&quot;The Elements&quot; of Euclid are treated by the synthetic method. This author, after having posed the &quot;axioms&quot;, and formed the requisites, established the propositions which he proves successively being supported by that which preceded, proceeding always from the &quot;simple to compound&quot;, which is the essential character of synthesis.

The heyday of synthetic geometry can be considered to have been the 19th century, when analytic methods based on coordinates and calculus were ignored by some geometers such as Jakob Steiner, in favor of a purely synthetic development of projective geometry. For example, the treatment of the projective plane starting from axioms of incidence is actually a broader theory (with more models) than is found by starting with a vector space of dimension three. Projective geometry has in fact the simplest and most elegant synthetic expression of any geometry.

In his Erlangen program, Felix Klein played down the tension between synthetic and analytic methods:
::On the Antithesis between the Synthetic and the Analytic Method in Modern Geometry:
:The distinction between modern synthesis and modern analytic geometry must no longer be regarded as essential, inasmuch as both subject-matter and methods of reasoning have gradually taken a similar form in both. We choose therefore in the text as common designation of them both the term projective geometry. Although the synthetic method has more to do with space-perception and thereby imparts a rare charm to its first simple developments, the realm of space-perception is nevertheless not closed to the analytic method, and the formulae of analytic geometry can be looked upon as a precise and perspicuous statement of geometrical relations. On the other hand, the advantage to original research of a well formulated analysis should not be underestimated, - an advantage due to its moving, so to speak, in advance of the thought. But it should always be insisted that a mathematical subject is not to be considered exhausted until it has become intuitively evident, and the progress made by the aid of analysis is only a first, though a very important, step.

The close axiomatic study of Euclidean geometry led to the construction of the Lambert quadrilateral and the Saccheri quadrilateral. These structures introduced the field of non-Euclidean geometry where Euclid&#x27;s parallel axiom is denied. Gauss, Bolyai and Lobachevski independently constructed hyperbolic geometry, where parallel lines have an angle of parallelism that depends on their separation. This study became widely accessible through the Poincaré disc model where motions are given by Möbius transformations. Similarly, Riemann, a student of Gauss&#x27;s, constructed Riemannian geometry, of which elliptic geometry is a particular case.

Another example concerns inversive geometry as advanced by Ludwig Immanuel Magnus, which can be considered synthetic in spirit. The closely related operation of reciprocation expresses analysis of the plane.

Karl von Staudt showed that algebraic axioms, such as commutativity and associativity of addition and multiplication, were in fact consequences of incidence of lines in geometric configurations. David Hilbert showed that the Desargues configuration played a special role. Further work was done by Ruth Moufang and her students. The concepts have been one of the motivators of incidence geometry.

When parallel lines are taken as primary, synthesis produces affine geometry. Though Euclidean geometry is both an affine and metric geometry, in general affine spaces may be missing a metric. The extra flexibility thus afforded makes affine geometry appropriate for the study of spacetime, as discussed in the history of affine geometry.

In 1955 Herbert Busemann and Paul J. Kelley sounded a nostalgic note for synthetic geometry:
:Although reluctantly, geometers must admit that the beauty of synthetic geometry has lost its appeal for the new generation. The reasons are clear: not so long ago synthetic geometry was the only field in which the reasoning proceeded strictly from axioms, whereas this appeal — so fundamental to many mathematically interested people — is now made by many other fields.

For example, college studies now include linear algebra, topology, and graph theory where the subject is developed from first principles, and propositions are deduced by elementary proofs. Expecting to replace synthetic with analytic geometry leads to loss of geometric content.

Today&#x27;s student of geometry has axioms other than Euclid&#x27;s available: see Hilbert&#x27;s axioms and Tarski&#x27;s axioms.

Ernst Kötter published a (German) report in 1901 on &quot;The development of synthetic geometry from Monge to Staudt (1847)&quot;;

==Proofs using synthetic geometry==

Synthetic proofs of geometric theorems make use of auxiliary constructs (such as helping lines) and concepts such as equality of sides or angles and similarity and congruence of triangles. Examples of such proofs can be found in the articles Butterfly theorem, Angle bisector theorem, Apollonius&#x27; theorem, British flag theorem, Ceva&#x27;s theorem, Equal incircles theorem, Geometric mean theorem, Heron&#x27;s formula, Isosceles triangle theorem, Law of cosines, and others that are linked to here.

==Computational synthetic geometry==

In conjunction with computational geometry, a computational synthetic geometry has been founded, having close connection, for example, with matroid theory. Synthetic differential geometry is an application of topos theory to the foundations of differentiable manifold theory.

<text>Discipline is the self-control that is gained by requiring that rules or orders be obeyed, and the ability to keep working at something that is difficult. Disciplinarians believe that such self-control is of the utmost importance and enforce a set of rules that aim to develop such behavior. Such enforcement is sometimes based on punishment, although there is a clear difference between the two. One way to convey such differences is through the root meaning of each word: discipline means “to teach”, while punishment means “to correct or cause pain”. Punishment may extinguish unwanted behavior in the moment, but is ineffective long-term; discipline, by contrast, includes the process of training self control.

==Self-discipline==
Self-discipline refers to one&#x27;s ability to control one&#x27;s behavior and actions to achieve a goal or to maintain a certain standard of conduct. It is the ability to train oneself to do things that should be done and resisting things that should be avoided. This includes setting goals, staying focused, and making sacrifices to those goals. Self-discipline requires practice and effort, but it can lead to improved productivity, better decision-making, and greater success in life.

Self-discipline can also be defined as the ability to give up immediate pleasures for long-term goals (deferred gratification). Discipline is grounded in the ability to leave one&#x27;s comfort zone. Habit is about wanting to change for the better, not for pain. To forego or sacrifice immediate pleasure requires thought and focused discipline. Self-discipline is about one&#x27;s ability to control their desires and impulses to keep themselves focused on what needs to get done to successfully achieve a goal. It is about taking small, consistent steps of daily action to build a strong set of disciplined habits that fulfill your objectives. One trains themselves to follow rules and standards that help determine, coalesce, and line up one&#x27;s thoughts and actions with the task at hand. Small acts allow one to achieve greater goals. The key component of self-discipline is the trait of persistence or perseverance. Daily choices accumulate to produce changes one wants the most, despite obstacles. Self-discipline, determination, and perseverance are similar to grit. 

Discipline is about internal and external consistencies. One must decide on what is right from wrong (internal consistency) and adhere to external regulation, which is to have compliance with rules (external consistency). Discipline is used to &quot;expend some effort&quot; to do something one does not feel motivated to do. Discipline is an action that completes, furthers, or solidifies a goal, not merely one&#x27;s thoughts and feelings. An action conforms to a value. In other words, one allows values to determine one&#x27;s own choices.

Self-discipline may prevent procrastination. People regret things they have not done compared to things they have done. When one procrastinates, they spend time on things that avoid a goal. Procrastination is not always caused by laziness or relaxation. One can procrastinate due to failure or inability to learn.

=== Habits ===
A life-changing habit enhances health, working life, and quality of life. Habits are established in three stages:

# Trigger (the thing that initiates the behavior)
# Behavior (the action one takes)
# Reward (the benefit one gains from doing the behavior)

To effectively utilize this three-step process, it is essential to recognize emotional triggers and maintain a consistent reward. Identifying one&#x27;s emotional responses helps pinpoint behavioral patterns that prompt learned routines and outcomes. These patterns might hinder goal achievement. Transforming these responses involves finding alternative ways to fulfill emotional needs and adopting preferred behaviors. Discovering the required emotional state requires effort, as does establishing new, healthier habits that satisfy one&#x27;s needs.

There are connections between motivation, self-discipline, and habits:
Motivation is the initial emotional drive or inspiration to help one develop one&#x27;s goals and actions.
When motivation begins to waver, it is a self-discipline that makes one continue despite one&#x27;s emotions and thoughts.

Over time, self-discipline diminishes as one&#x27;s behaviors and actions become habits.

It takes two months for a new habit to form, according to research by Phillippa Lally and colleagues. Making a mistake has no measurable impact on any long-term habits. Habit-making is a process and not an event.

When one is developing habits to overcome impulses that represent easy paths to short-term gratification, they need control over their mind. Gaining control over one&#x27;s minds, and taking a proactive approach, enables them to navigate challenges without becoming overly fixated on failure, financial strains, or anxiety. Mental anxiety, in particular, can contribute to heightened sensitivity to our surroundings, possibly leading to unnecessary alarmism. Chronic stress can be detrimental to the development of the executive function, and may make us perceive problems where they do not exist, as outnumbering the solutions, according to Hauser-Cram Heyman. 

Brett McKay recommends to focus on one&#x27;s circle of influence—what one can control—rather than one&#x27;s own sphere of concern, which encompasses things beyond one&#x27;s control. Self-discipline can be as straightforward as tackling a challenging task before bedtime or during other moments of the day; it is about carving out a portion of one&#x27;s day to cultivate self-discipline. It involves resisting the temptation of opting for the easiest route (primitive urges) to achieve long-term goals.

A person&#x27;s actions are a product of one&#x27;s ability to control themselves, both positively and negatively. Habits are automatic mechanisms that conserve one&#x27;s willpower energy. About 40% of a person&#x27;s actions are driven by programmed habits. The longer one holds to bad habits, the more difficult it is to break free from them. As one resists temptations, one&#x27;s desires get stronger.

Choices often involve a trade-off between with short-term pleasure in exchange for long-term pain (immediate gratification) or short-term pain and long-term pleasure (delayed gratification). Discipline entails executing habits precisely as intended, enhancing the likelihood of accomplishment and overcoming competing behaviors. Acting promptly exemplifies discipline, while habits are built on preparedness and inclination. This requires a suitable level of buffering against competing behaviors.

There are three ways to learn to build discipline, according to Sam Thomas Davies:

* self-assessment
: Determine the underlying reason for requiring discipline. Address resistance by identifying its source and counteracting it through commitment instead of making excuses or yielding to peer pressure.

* self-awareness
: Learn why oneself does not break their habits, mostly due to a lack of awareness about the ease of succumbing to impulses rather than staying committed. A remedy is to eliminate any distractions.

* self-celebration
: Celebrate and reward daily accomplishments, even if one fails to live up to one&#x27;s expectations. Each outcome provides an opportunity for learning and growth.

There are two types of goals: active and passive. Passive goals are ideas, while active goals are concrete plans with specific measures and steps. This includes setting long-term objectives and planning daily tasks. Creating active goals provides direction and helps prevent distractions by outlining precisely what needs to be done.

===In religion===
Self-discipline is an important principle in several religious systems. For example, in Buddhist ethics as outlined in the Noble Eightfold Path, both Right View and Right Mindfulness have been described as a moral discipline.

For some varieties of Christian ethics, virtues directed by the Beatitudes were preceded by ascetical theology and obedience-based discipline. This shift transformed the focus from the Gifts of the Holy Spirit to one of authority, which, though blessed, did not carry the same happiness as that derived from adherence and observances. During the Middle Ages, spirituality and morality were closely intertwined. The Beatitudes gained prominence as an organizational principle after Saint Augustine. However, Christian ethics as a form of discipline did not fully emerge until the Late Middle Ages. Alongside Lutheranism and the post-Enlightenment era, obedience-based discipline coexists.
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, &quot;[t]he object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the three &#x27;sources&#x27; of the morality of human acts.&quot; The Holy Spirit is essential for comprehending &quot;the eternal Word of the living God, [and] must... open (our) minds to understand the Scriptures.&quot;

Self-discipline is how self-control is gained, and the way hope is maintained.

==Self-control==

Gaining self-control involves managing reactions. External events or outcomes in one&#x27;s life can never be controlled, yet reactions and attitudes can. 

Maintaining a disciplined mind leads to effective reactions. Firstly, boredom can be created if one is not occupied. Secondly, lack of discipline may cause problems for social, mental, and academic performance, as excessive worry about future events consumes time. Thirdly, discipline helps preserve peace and order. Lastly, the disciplined person understands the consequences of their actions.

Self-control includes avoiding impulsivity, eating disorders, and addictive behaviors. Overcoming such tendencies is an initial step for personal improvement. The ability to regulate one&#x27;s emotions and behavior is a key component of the brain&#x27;s executive function that helps to plan, monitor, and attain goals. Succumbing to immediate impulses hinders both internal growth and external impact. Self-control entails resisting certain actions, whereas discipline involves adopting routines to cultivate positive habits. Self-control means effective decision-making amid competing choices, while discipline fosters the accumulation of habits to bolster success; thus, self-control and discipline may overlap. Anyone can benefit from healthy habits and can take measures to control their behavior.

Four strategies are: 

* situation selection, avoiding situations where one will be likely to confront temptations

* situation modification, doing what one can to reduce the pull of the temptation in the situation that arises

* distraction, trying to distract oneself with better alternatives

* reappraisal, changing the way one thinks about a bad habit

<doc id="267488" wikidata="Q2366307" url="?curid=267488" title="Reference Daily Intake">
<text>In the U.S. and Canada, the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) is used in nutrition labeling on food and dietary supplement products to indicate the daily intake level of a nutrient that is considered to be sufficient to meet the requirements of 97–98% of healthy individuals in every demographic in the United States. While developed for the US population, it has been adopted by Canada.

The RDI is used to determine the Daily Value (DV) of foods, which is printed on nutrition facts labels (as %DV) in the United States and Canada, and is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by Health Canada, respectively. The labels &quot;high&quot;, &quot;rich in&quot;, or &quot;excellent source of&quot; may be used for a food if it contains 20% or more of the DV. The labels &quot;good source&quot;, &quot;contains&quot;, or &quot;provides&quot; may be used on a food if it contains between 10% and 20% of the DV, and &quot;low source&quot; applies if the %DV is 5% or lower.

The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) were a set of nutrition recommendations that evolved into both the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) system of nutrition recommendations (which still defines RDA values) and the RDIs used for food labeling. The first regulations governing U.S. nutrition labels specified a % U.S. RDA declaration based on the current RDA values, which had been published in 1968. Later, the % U.S. RDA was renamed the %DV and the RDA values that the %DVs were based on became the RDIs.

The RDAs (and later the RDA values within the DRI) were regularly revised to reflect the latest scientific information, but although the nutrition labeling regulations were occasionally updated, the existing RDI values were not changed, so that until 2016, many of the DVs used on nutrition facts labels were still based on the outdated RDAs from 1968. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration published changes to the regulations including updated RDIs and DVs based primarily on the RDAs in the current DRI.

== Food labeling reference tables ==
The reference dietary intake (RDI) gives numbers based on gender and age. The Daily Value (DV) is put on the labels of food products and is meant for the general population.

===Daily Values===
The FDA issued a final rule on changes to the facts panel on May 27, 2016. The new values were published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on May 4, 2018, the FDA released a final rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. During the first six months following the January 1, 2020 compliance date, the FDA worked cooperatively with manufacturers to meet the new Nutrition Facts label requirements, and did not focus on enforcement actions regarding these requirements during that time.

===Labeling requirements===
As of 2024, the FDA requires manufacturers to display the contents and %DVs of certain nutrients on packaged food or supplement labels, with the instruction: 

&quot;The Nutrition Facts label must list total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, and certain vitamins and minerals. While the actual amount and %DV of vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be listed, other vitamins and minerals may be listed voluntarily by the manufacturer.&quot;

&quot;However, they are required to list any vitamins and minerals that are added to the food or if a statement is made on the package labeling about their health effects or the amount contained in the food (for example, &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;).&quot;

&quot;Similarly, the Supplement Facts label is required to list the same nutrients as the Nutrition Facts label when any of these nutrients are found in the supplement in an amount considered to be greater than zero.&quot;

The following table lists the DVs based on a caloric intake of 2000 kcal (8400 kJ), for adults and children four or more years of age, as of 2024.

== History ==

The RDI is derived from the RDAs, which were first developed during World War II by Lydia J. Roberts, Hazel Stiebeling and Helen S. Mitchell, all part of a committee established by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to investigate issues of nutrition that might &quot;affect national defense&quot; (Nestle, p 35). The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941, after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations for a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient. The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces, civilians, and overseas populations who might need food relief. Roberts, Stiebeling, and Mitchell surveyed all available data, created a tentative set of allowances for &quot;energy and eight nutrients&quot;, and submitted them to experts for review (Nestle, p 35). The final set of guidelines, called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances, was accepted in 1941. The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel, so they included a &quot;margin of safety&quot;. Because of food rationing during the war, the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens&#x27; nutritional intake also took food availability into account.

The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years. In 1973, the FDA introduced regulations to specify the format of nutrition labels when present, although the inclusion of such labels was largely voluntary, only being required if nutrition claims were made or if nutritional supplements were added to the food. The nutrition labels were to include percent U.S. RDA based on the 1968 RDAs in effect at the time. The RDAs continued to be updated (in 1974, 1980 and 1989) but the values specified for nutrition labeling remained unchanged.

In 1993, the FDA published new regulations mandating the inclusion of a nutrition facts label on most packaged foods. Originally the FDA had proposed replacing the percent U.S. RDAs with percent daily values based on the 1989 RDAs but the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 prevented it from doing so. Instead, it introduced the RDI to be the basis of the new daily values. The RDI consisted of the existing U.S. RDA values (still based on the 1968 RDAs as the FDA was not allowed to change them at the time) and new values for additional nutrients not included in the 1968 RDAs.

In 1997, at the suggestion of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy, the RDAs became one part of a broader set of dietary guidelines called the Dietary Reference Intake used by both the United States and Canada. As part of the DRI, the RDAs continued to be updated.

On May 27, 2016, the FDA updated the regulations to change the RDI and Daily Values to reflect current scientific information. Until this time, the Daily Values were still largely based on the 1968 RDAs. The new regulations make several other changes to the nutrition facts label to facilitate consumer understanding of the calorie and nutrient contents of their foods, emphasizing nutrients of current concern, such as vitamin D and potassium. The revision to the regulations came into effect on 26 July 2016 and initially stipulated that larger manufacturers must comply within two years while smaller manufacturers had an additional year. On May 4, 2018, the FDA released a final rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020, for large companies and to January 1, 2021, for small companies. During the first six months following the January 1, 2020 compliance date, the FDA worked cooperatively with manufacturers to meet the new Nutrition Facts label requirements and did not focus on enforcement actions regarding these requirements during that time.

==Sodium and potassium==

In 2010, the U.S. Institute of Medicine determined that the government should establish new consumption standards for salt to reduce the amount of sodium in the typical American diet below levels associated with higher risk of several cardiovascular diseases, yet maintain consumer preferences for salt-flavored food. In 1999, the average American adult ingested nearly 4,000 mg of sodium daily, far above the National Research Council recommendation that the general U.S. population consume no more than 2,400 mg of sodium (or 6 grams of salt) per day. For instance, the National Research Council said in 1989 that 500 milligrams of sodium per day (approximately 1,250 milligrams of table salt) &quot;might be&quot; a safe minimum level, based on estimated and assumed obligatory urinary, fecal, and dermal losses. In the United Kingdom, the daily allowance for salt is 6 g (approximately 1.2 teaspoons, about the upper limit in the U.S.), an amount considered &quot;too high&quot;.

The Institute of Medicine advisory stated (daily intake basis): &quot;Americans consume more than 3,400 milligrams of sodium – the amount in about 1.5 teaspoons of salt (8.7 g) – each day. The recommended maximum daily intake of sodium – the amount above which health problems appear – is 2,300 milligrams per day for adults, about 1 teaspoon of salt (5.9 g). The recommended adequate intake of sodium is 1,500 milligrams (3.9 g salt) per day, and people over 50 need even less.&quot;

The Daily Value for potassium, 4,700 mg per day, was based on a study of men who were given 14.6 g of sodium chloride per day and treated with potassium supplements until the frequency of salt sensitivity was reduced to 20%.

<text>Dayr al-Qassi or Deir el-Qasi (), was a Palestinian Arab village located 26 km northeast of the city of Acre, which was depopulated during 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

==Geography==
The village was located 26 km northeast of the city of Acre, on a rocky hill about 5 km south of the Lebanese border. It was linked by a paved road to Fassuta in the north and Tarshiha in the southwest. The road divided the town into an eastern and western quarter, or &quot;harat&quot;, the eastern quarter being higher up.

==History==
The first part of the village name, &quot;Dayr&quot; (&quot;monastery&quot;) suggest that the village might have had a monastery and a Christian population. However, in modern times the population was Muslim. According to the residents of the village, ancient artifacts from the Canaanite, Israelite and Roman period were unearthed in the Ottoman and British Mandate period.

Ceramics from the late Roman and the Byzantine eras have been found here.

In the Crusader era it was known as &quot;Cassie&quot;, and in 1183 it was noted that &quot;Godfrey de Tor&quot; sold the land of the village to Joscelin III. In 1220 Jocelyn III&#x27;s daughter Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Otto von Botenlauben, Count of Henneberg, sold their land, including &quot;Cassie&quot; and the nearby &quot;Roeis&quot; (Khirbet Tell ‘er-Ruwesah/Tel Rosh), to the Teutonic Knights.

Remains from the Mamluk era have been found in the area.
===Ottoman Empire===
Dayr al-Qassi was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and it belonged to the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of &quot;Jira&quot;, part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). In the 1596 tax records Dayr al-Qassi had a population of 24 Muslim household; an estimated 132 persons. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rated of 25% on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, as well as on goats and beehives; a total of 345 akçe.

In the early 18th century, Dayr al-Qassi was a fortified village controlled by a local sheikh (chief) named Abd al-Khaliq Salih. In 1740, Sheikh Zahir al-Umar, a local &quot;multazim&quot; (tax farmer) from the Banu Zaydan family whose strength was growing throughout the Galilee, struggled to gain control of Dayr al-Qassi. Later that year, he made the village part of his domain by marrying Sheikh Salih&#x27;s daughter, thereby sealing an alliance with the latter&#x27;s family. In late 1767, Zahir&#x27;s son Ali of Safed requested control of Dayr al-Qassi from his father after his request for Dayr Hanna was rejected. Zahir refused and the two entered into an armed conflict, which Zahir won. Nonetheless, Zahir pardoned Ali and ultimately ceded the village to him.

In 1838, Dayr al-Qassi was noted as a Muslim village in the Jabal subdistrict, located west of Safed.

Victor Guérin visited Dayr al-Qassi in 1875, and he estimated that the village had 350 Muslim inhabitants. In 1881, Dayr al-Qassi was described in the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) as being situated on a ridge, encircled by fig and olive trees and arable land. It then had a population of about 200. A population list from about 1887 showed Dayr al-Qassi to have about 945 inhabitants, all Muslims.

===British Mandate===

At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate, Dayr al-Qassi had a population of 663 Muslims. increasing in the 1931 census, when Dayr al-Qassi had a population of 865, still all Muslims, living in a total of 169 houses.

Later, Dayr al-Qassi was mostly Muslim but had a large Palestinian Christian minority. According to the 1945 census it had 1,250 inhabitants; 370 Christians and 880 Muslims. Together with the two villages of Fassuta and al-Mansura, the population was 2,300 and their total land area was 34,011 dunums. 1,607 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 6,475 used for cereals, while 247 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===Israel===
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Dayr al-Qassi was defended by the Arab Liberation Army but the village was occupied by the Israeli Army during its offensive Operation Hiram on October 30, 1948. At the same time, Dayr al-Qassi was bombed by the Israelis, which they claimed was &quot;by mistake&quot;, and seven residents were killed. In December 1948, there was a suggestion of sending new Jewish immigrants to settle al-Bassa, Dayr al-Qassi and Tarshiha, but Aharon Zisling objected to sending militarily untrained immigrants there. 

However, in January 1949, the Cabinet voted to &quot;encourage introducing ‘olim into all the abandoned villages in the Galilee&quot;. The village&#x27;s residents were (again) expelled on 27 May 1949 and most migrated north into Lebanon. By June 1949, it was reported that the whole northern area had been &quot;Judaised&quot;, including Tarshiha, Suhmata, Dayr al-Qassi, Tarbikha, Meirun, al-Sammu&#x27;i, Safsaf and al-Ras al-Ahmar. 

Elkosh was established in 1949, and occupies part of the village site. Netu&#x27;a, founded in 1966, Mattat, founded in 1979 and Abirim, founded in 1980, are also on village land. Netu&#x27;a is near the neighboring village of al-Mansura.

The Palestinian historian, Walid Khalidi, described the remaining structures on the village land in 1992: &quot;A few stone houses still are used as residences or warehouses by the inhabitants of Elqosh. The debris of destroyed houses is strewn over the site. The school building stands deserted. Fig and olive trees and cactuses grow on the site.&quot; In 2004, some of the remains of the village were removed by mechanical equipment during excavations by the Israel Antiquities Authority.

In 2000, a book about the village history was published by Ibrahim Khalil Uthman.

<doc id="267496" wikidata="Q713853" url="?curid=267496" title="Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin">
<text>The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a species of humpback dolphin inhabiting coastal waters of the eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans. This species is often referred to as the Chinese white dolphin in mainland China, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan as a common name. Some biologists regard the Indo-Pacific dolphin as a subspecies of the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (&quot;S. plumbea&quot;) which ranges from East Africa to India. However, DNA testing studies have shown that the two are distinct species. A new species, the Australian humpback dolphin (&quot;S. sahulensis&quot;), was split off from &quot;S. chinensis&quot; and recognized as a distinct species in 2014. Nevertheless, there are still several unresolved issues in differentiation of the Indian Ocean-type and Indo-Pacific-type humpback dolphins.

==Taxonomy==
Two subspecies of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin are currently recognized:
*&quot;S. c. chinensis&quot;, or the Chinese humpback dolphin
*&quot;S. c. taiwanensis&quot;, or the Taiwanese humpback dolphin

== Description ==

An adult Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is grey, white or pink and may appear as an albino dolphin to some. Populations along the coasts of China and Thailand have been observed with pink skin. The pink colour originates not from a pigment, but from blood vessels which were overdeveloped for thermoregulation. The body length is for adults, for infants. An adult weighs . Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins live up to 40 years, as determined by the analysis of their teeth.

Calves are dark grey or black at birth and measure around 1 m (3.3 ft) in length. Their coloration lightens through a mottled grey as they age.

== Behaviour ==
Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins live in small groups, generally with fewer than ten individuals. They hunt as a group using echolocation.

Adult dolphins come to the water surface to breathe for 20 to 30 seconds before diving deep again, for two to eight minutes. Dolphin calves, with smaller lung capacities, surface twice as often as adults, staying underwater for one to three minutes. Adult dolphins rarely stay under water for more than four minutes.
They sometimes leap completely out of the water. They may also rise up vertically from the water, exposing the dorsal half of their bodies. A pair of protruding eyes allows them to see clearly in both air and water.

== Reproduction ==

Female dolphins reach sexual maturity at around ten years old, while males mature at around 13 years old. They usually mate from the end of summer to autumn, and calves are born after a gestation period of eleven months. The mother stays with her calf until it can find food for itself, usually when it reaches 3–4 years old.

== Threats ==
The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is threatened by habitat loss, water pollution, coastal development, overfishing and an increase in marine traffic within its range.

In 2015 the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin was classed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

=== Water pollution ===
In 2013, conservationists in Hong Kong warned that the local population had fallen from 158 individuals in 2003 to just 78 in 2011. Members of Hong Kong Dolphinwatch spotted a group of dolphins helping a mother to support her dead calf above the water in an attempt to revive it. A Dolphinwatch spokeswoman claimed that the calf had died after ingesting toxins from polluted seawater through its mother&#x27;s milk. The Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society warned of a further decline in dolphin numbers in the area.

=== Plastic pollution ===

Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins are at particular risk of exposure to organic pollutants because they inhabit shallow coastal waters, which are often impacted by human activities. Anthropogenic pollutants pose a risk to marine mammals that reside in coastal waters. Discharge of organic pollutants into marine environments has been shown to decrease water quality, resulting in habitat loss and a significant reduction in species richness. The loss of key pods has caused species fragmentation, &quot;also due to habitat loss&quot;, which increases species isolation and decreases connectivity, resulting in population decline.

Plastic pollution is widespread across all oceans due to the buoyant and durable properties of plastic, which allow for sorption of toxicants to plastic while traveling through the environment. This has led researchers to the conclusion that synthetic polymers are hazardous to marine life and should be declared as a hazardous waste type. There are many transit paths that allow for plastics and pollutions to enter oceans: freshwater waste can enter oceans by rivers at the delta or estuary, by humans discarding their waste directly into marine waters, or through photo-degradation and other forms of weathering processes that aid in plastic fragmentation and dispersal. Large quantities of fragmented plastics collect in subtropical ocean gyres. Plastic accumulation is not limited to ocean gyres; closed bays, gulfs and seas surrounded by densely populated coastlines and watersheds are all susceptible.

The consumption of plastics causes adverse effects in marine mammals such as disease susceptibility, reproductive and developmental toxicity. Constant absorption of organic pollutants like plastic can be transferred into the dolphin&#x27;s tissues and organs through an ingestion pathway that is impacting megafauna, lower trophic levels and predators (not limited to Indo-Pacific). Organ toxicity can lead to organ failure, loss of offspring and milk toxicity. Even if the dolphin is not consuming plastic directly then it can take in plastic pollutants through biomagnification and bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation is defined as the uptake of chemicals from the environment through dietary intake, dermal (skin) absorption or respiratory transport in air or water. This is a huge factor in plastic toxicity consumption in this species due to its long lifespan, which makes it susceptible to chronic exposure. Also, these dolphins contain a large quantity of blubber, &quot;lipids&quot;, which can result in an excess of toxicity storage in their tissues. 

Plastic pollution can also interfere with dolphins&#x27; use of echolocation. Echolocation is the main sense that all dolphins use to navigate, as well as to pinpoint prey and predators. Dolphins and whales use echolocation by bouncing high-pitched clicking sounds off underwater objects, similar to shouting and listening for echoes. The sounds are made by squeezing air through nasal passages near the blowhole. These sound-waves then pass into the forehead, where a big blob of fat called the melon focuses them into a beam. This process can be interrupted by noise pollution, as well as by obstructions in the water such as masses of oil or plastics. Large blockages in the water can refract sound-waves, misleading the dolphin to falsely detect prey, kin or a predator in the area. This can become confusing and frustrating which can lead to extreme stress and potential health issues.

Clusters of plastic debris can cause noise pollution which interferes with the dolphins&#x27; sense of echolocation. As plastic debris is hurled together by ocean currents, sound is produced underwater. An excess of sound waves underwater can render the dolphins&#x27; sense of echolocation useless.

==Distributions and watching==

In Hong Kong, boat trips to visit the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins have been running since the 1990s. The dolphins mainly live in the waters of Lantau North, Southeast Lantau, the Soko Islands and Peng Chau. A code of conduct regulates dolphin-watching activity in Hong Kong waters.

There have been some reports of dolphin watching practices that have further endangered the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, such as in Sanniang Bay dolphin sanctuary in Qinzhou and off Xiamen. However, these generally are small, locally organised one-off tours or private pleasure boats that do not adhere to the Hong Kong Agricultural and Fisheries Department&#x27;s voluntary code of conduct.

Nánpēng Islands Marine Sanctuary in Nan&#x27;ao County is also home to local pods. The population in Leizhou Bay, Leizhou Peninsula, comprising nearly 1,000 animals and the second largest population in the nation, may also be targeted for future tourism. Hepu National Sanctuary of Dugongs, and waters around Sanya Bay and other coasts adjacent on Hainan Island are home to some dolphins. As the environment and local ecosystems recovery, dolphins&#x27; presences in nearby waters have been increasing such as vicinity to the nature sanctuary of Weizhou and Xieyang Islands. Gulf of Tonkin waters in Vietnam may have unstudied populations that may appear elsewhere such as along Xuân Thủy National Park and Hòn Dáu Island in Hải Phòng.

Cambodia: In December 2023, the Marine Conservation Cambodia (MCC) estimated between 100 and 200 the number of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in the region of Kampot and Koh Kong. During a survey in May of 2024, MCC observed a pod of humpback dolphins with an Irrawady dolphin mother and calf on the Prek Tnaot River in Kampot.

==Cantonese slang==
The Cantonese language has a slang expression &quot;wu gei bak gei&quot; (often written as 烏忌白忌, &quot;black taboo white taboo&quot;) which means someone or something is a bad omen or a nuisance. The phrase originates from the Cantonese fisher people, because they claim the dolphins eat the fish in their nets. However, in formal Chinese, it should be written as 烏鱀白鱀, with the &quot;gei&quot; originally in old Chinese, meaning dolphins. The &quot;wu&quot; refers to the finless porpoises, which are black, and the &quot;bak&quot;, white, referring to Chinese river dolphins. These two species often interrupt and ruin the fishermen&#x27;s catch. As years passed, because &quot;dolphin&quot; sounds the same as &quot;bad luck&quot;, the meaning of the phrase changed. 
However, in Cantonese, &quot;wu&quot; refers to the calves of Chinese white dolphin and &quot;bak&quot; refers to the adults. Nowadays, dolphins are not called &quot;gei&quot; anymore, but 海豚 (&quot;hai tun&quot;), literally meaning &quot;sea pig&quot;, with none of the negative connotations for pig found in English.

==Taiwanese humpback dolphin==
The Taiwanese humpback dolphin (&quot;S. c. taiwanensis&quot;) is a subspecies of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin found in the Eastern Taiwan Strait. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins were first discovered along the west coast of Taiwan in 2002. Based on a survey done in 2002 and 2003, they are often found in waters &lt;5m deep, and no evidence shows that they appear in water deeper than 15m. A study in 2008 found that the population of humpback dolphins, which occupies a linear range of about 500 km^2 along the central west coast of Taiwan, is genetically distinct from all populations living in other areas. This population is called Eastern Taiwan Strait population.

Taiwan is a densely populated island and highly developed area, which has many industrial development projects, especially along the west coast, where the Eastern Taiwan Strait populations of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins live. Based on data collected between 2002 and 2005, the Eastern Taiwan Strait population of humpback dolphins was less than 100 individuals. The newest data released in 2012 shows that only 62 individuals are left. It means during those 7 years, population of humpback dolphins is being destroyed constantly and severely. A preliminary examination revealed that the Eastern Taiwan Strait humpback dolphin population meets the IUCN Red List criteria for &quot;Critically endangered&quot;. Without further protection and regulation, this population will go extinct quickly. The Eastern Taiwan Strait is listed as Endangered species Under the Endangered Species Act by NOAA Fisheries since 2018.

There are several facts that result in the decreasing number of Eastern Taiwan Strait population of humpback dolphins. First, large-scale modification of the shoreline by industrial development including hydraulic filling for creating industrial or science parks, seawall construction and sand mining cause habitat fragmentation and diminish dolphin&#x27;s habitats. In addition, exploitation of shoreline also contributes to toxic contamination flows into dolphin&#x27;s habitats. The chemical pollution from industrial or agricultural and municipal discharge results in impaired health of dolphins, for instance, reproductive disorders, and compromised immune system.

Second, fishing activities along the west coast of Taiwan are thriving, and cause many impacts on dolphins. Widespread and intensive use of gillnets and vessel strikes are potential threats for dolphins. Over exploitation of fish by fisheries&#x27; is another threat for the dolphin population. It has led to disturbance of marine food web or trophic level and reduces marine biodiversity. Therefore, dolphins have not enough prey to live on.

Still another problem is reduced amount of freshwater flows into estuaries from rivers. Since the Eastern Taiwan Strait population of humpback dolphins is closely associated with estuaries habitat, the elimination of freshwater discharge from rivers significantly decreases the amount of suitable habitats for dolphins.

Hydroacoustic disturbance is another critical issue for dolphins. Sources of noise can come from dredging, pile driving, increased vessel traffic, seawall construction, and soil improvement. For all cetaceans, sound is vital for providing information about their environment, communicating with other individuals, and foraging; also, they are very vulnerable and sensitive to the effects of noise. Elevated anthropogenic sound level causes many dysfunctions of their behaviors, and even leads to death.

In addition to threats from anthropogenic activities, dolphins are potentially at the risk due to the small population size, which may result in inbreeding and decreased genetic and demographic variability. Finally, climate change causes more typhoons to hit the west coast of Taiwan and cause great disturbance to dolphins&#x27; habitats.

== Conservation ==

The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is listed on Appendix II of the convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. In the interim of 2003–2013, the number of these dolphins in the bay around Hong Kong has dwindled from a population of 159 to just 61 individuals, a population decline of 60% in the last decade. The population continues to be further threatened by pollution, vessel collision, overfishing, and underwater noise pollution.

In addition to their natural susceptibility to anthropogenic disturbances, the Chinese white dolphin&#x27;s late sexual maturity, reduced fecundity, reduced calf survival, and long calving intervals heavily curtails their ability to naturally cope with elevated rates of mortality.

In recent years, Taiwan launched the largest Indo-Pacific Humpbacked Dolphin sanctuary on the Taiwanese coast, stretching from Miaoli County to Chiayi County. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is also covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).

== Timeline of main events ==

* 1637: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin was first documented in English by the adventurer Peter Mundy in Hong Kong near the Pearl River. The species are attracted to the Pearl River Estuary because of its brackish waters.
* 1765: Pehr Osbeck gives the first scientific description of the species.
* Late 1980s: Environmentalists started to pay attention to the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin population.
* Early 1990: The Hong Kong public started to become aware of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin. This was due to the side effects of the construction of the Chek Lap Kok Airport. It was one of the world&#x27;s largest single reclamation projects: the reclamation of nine square kilometers of the seabed near Northern Lantau, which was one of the major habitats of the dolphins.
* Early 1993: Re-evaluation of the environmental effects of the construction of Chek Lap Kok Airport. This alerted eco-activists such as those from the World Wide Fund for Nature in Hong Kong, in turn bringing media attention on the matter. Soon enough, the Hong Kong Government began getting involved by funding projects to research on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins
* Late 1993: The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department was founded.
* 1996: Dr. Thomas Jefferson began to conduct research on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in hope of discovering more about them.
* 1997: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin became the official mascot of the 1997 sovereignty changing ceremonies in Hong Kong.
* 1998: The research results of Dr. Thomas Jefferson was published in &quot;Wildlife Monographs&quot;.
* 1998: The Hong Kong Dolphinwatch was organized and began to run dolphin watching tours for the general public to raise the public&#x27;s awareness of the species.
* 2000: The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department started to conduct long-term observation of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Hong Kong.
* 2000: The population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins has reached around 80–140 dolphins in the Pearl River waters.
* 2014: Jefferson and Rosenbaum revised the taxonomy of the humpback dolphins (&quot;Sousa&quot; spp.). They describe a new species, the Australian humpback dolphin and define the accepted common name for this species, the Indo-Pacific Humpback dolphin.

<doc id="267498" wikidata="Q4702414" url="?curid=267498" title="Al-Ghabisiyya">
<text>Al-Ghabisiyya was a Palestinian Arab village in northern Palestine, 16 km north-east of Acre in present-day Israel. It was depopulated by the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and remains deserted.

==History==
A wine press, dating to the Bronze Age, has been found at Al-Ghabisiyya. Other remains, suggesting that the place might have had a Roman and Byzantine settlement have also been discovered. One Corinthian capital was observed there in the 19th century.

During the Crusader period the site was known as &quot;La Gabasie&quot; and was one of the fiefs of &quot;Casal Imbert&quot;. It was described as part of the domain of the Crusaders during the &quot;hudna&quot; (&quot;truce&quot;) between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur Qalawun in 1283.

===Ottoman era===
The village corresponds to that of &quot;Ghabiyya&quot; in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Akka, part of Sanjak Safad, in the 1596 C.E. Ottoman tax register. This village had a population of 58 households (khana) and 2 bachelors (mujarrad), all Moslem. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, fruit trees, cotton, and water buffalo; a total of 6,334 akçe. 14/24 of the revenue went to a Waqf.

A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as &quot;El Rabsieh.&quot; The village mosque dates from the time of Ali Pasha al-Khazindar, father of Abdullah Pasha (i.e. some time before 1818 CE). French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he called &quot;El-Rhabsieh&quot;, in 1875. In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described al-Ghabisiyya as &quot;a village, built of stone, containing about 150 Moslems, on the edge of the plain, surrounded by olives, figs, pomegranate and gardens; a stream of water near, plentiful of water.&quot;

A population list from about 1887 showed that Al-Ghabisiyya had about 390 inhabitants, all Muslim.

===British Mandate era===
At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate, Al-Ghabisiyya had a population of 427, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 470, still Muslims, in a total of 125 houses.

The population grew to 690 in the 1945 statistics, still all Muslim. Together with the nearby villages of Shaykh Dannun and Shaykh Dawud, the village had 11,771 dunums of land in 1945. The local economy was based on livestock and agriculture. In 1944/45 a total of 6,633 dunums of land in the three villages was used for cereals, 1,371 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, and 58 dunams were built-up (urban) land. 300 dunums in Ghabisiyya were planted with olive trees.

===1948 war and depopulation===


The village was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. Like many Arab villages, it had a non-aggression pact with nearby Jewish communities. In the early months of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the villagers provided the Jewish militia Haganah with intelligence and ammunition in return for an agreement to not enter the village or harm the inhabitants. Despite these agreements, on May 21, 1948, the Haganah&#x27;s Carmeli Brigade attacked al-Ghabisiyya as part of Operation Ben-Ami. The Carmeli troops &quot;entered the village with guns blazing&quot;, killing a number of Palestinians, in what historian Saleh Abdel Jawad calls a massacre. Six villagers may have been executed under suspicion of participating in the Yehiam convoy attack.

The villagers fled or were expelled to nearby villages, where they remained until the complete Jewish conquest of the Galilee in October. At that time, many of the residents went to Lebanon while others fled to nearby Arab towns and became Israeli citizens due to their registration in the October–November census. The latter tried repeatedly to settle back in their village. Some apparently obtained permission but others went back illegally. On January 24, 1950, the Military Governor of the Galilee ordered all the residents of al-Ghabisiyya to leave within 48 hours and then declared the village a closed military area. No alternative accommodation had been arranged, and the villagers took up temporary residence in abandoned houses of nearby Shaykh Dawud and Sheikh Danun.

The expulsion caused a public controversy. The leaders of the leftist Mapam party condemned it, but they were undermined by the Mapam-dominated regional Jewish settlements bloc (one Mapam kibbutz of which was already cultivating al-Ghabisiyya&#x27;s land) which declared that the &quot;Arabs of Ghabisiyya should on no account be allowed to return to their village&quot;. In September 1950, some of the villagers again resettled the village but were sentenced to several months in prison and given fines.

===State of Israel===

In 1951, the villagers instituted proceedings against the Military Government in the High Court of Israel. The court ruled that the declaration of the village as a closed area had been improperly instituted, and in consequence &quot;the military governor had no authority to evict the petitioners [from the village] and he has no authority to prevent them from entering or leaving it or from residing there.&quot; The military government responded by sealing the village, and two days later again declared it to be a closed military area. The villagers appealed to the High Court again, but the court ruled that the new declaration was legal and in consequence villagers who had not managed to return to the village before that declaration (which in practice was all of them) were forbidden to go there without permission. The village thus remained deserted. Its lands were officially expropriated and in 1955 its houses were demolished leaving only the large mosque. Later attempts of the villagers to return to the village were not successful. The villagers set up a committee whose principal activity was to renovate the village cemetery and mosque, and in July 1972 the committee wrote to the prime minister:

In the village a mosque and the cemetery remain... The mosque is in a run-down state and the cemetery, where our relatives are buried, is neglected and overgrown with weeds to such an extent that it is impossible to identify the graves any more. Knowing that our state authorities have always taken care of the places of worship and cemeteries of all the ethnic communities... [we ask] to be enabled to carry out repairs on the mosque and also to repair and fence the cemetery and put it in order.

The authorities did not permit the al-Ghabisiyya&#x27;s residents to carry out the requested renovation of the mosque and cemetery. The land of the village, including the mosque, had been acquired by the Israel Land Administration (ILA) under one of the laws regarding land expropriation, and not the Ministry of Religion, which is responsible for holy places. In 1994 members of the village committee began renovating the mosque and praying there. In January 1996 the ILA sealed the entrance of the mosque, but the villagers broke through the fence and again used the mosque for prayers. The villagers appealed to Prime Minister Shimon Peres in April 1996, they received a reply on his behalf from one of his aides: 
The government of Israel regards itself as obligated to maintain the holy places of all religions, including, of course, cemeteries and mosques sacred to Islam. The prime minister has stated to the heads of the Arab community, with whom he recently met, that the government would see to the renovation and the restoration of the dignity of mosques in abandoned villages, including the mosque in Ghabisiyya. 
However, Shimon Peres was defeated in the next prime ministerial elections, and in March 1997 police surrounded the mosque and representatives from ILA removed copies of the Quran and prayer rugs and once again sealed the entrance of the mosque. The conflict was carried to the court in Acre, where the uprooted villagers contended that the government action was contrary to Israel&#x27;s &quot;Law of Preservation of Holy Places&quot;. The ILA challenged the villagers right to pray there, and used the illegal eviction of 1951 and the demolition of the village in 1955 as arguments to bolster its claim:&quot;The village of Ghabisiyya was abandoned by its inhabitants and destroyed during the War for Independence&quot;... [the mosque..had stood]..&quot;lonely and neglected&quot;...&quot;and since it was in a run-down and unstable state that constituted a threat to the safety of those inside it, it was decided by the Ministry of Religions to seal it and fence it off.

The court declined to issue an injunction permitting worshippers back into the mosque. The Ghabisiyya villagers still pray in the field outside the sealed mosque.

<text>Iqrit ( or إقرث, &quot;Iqrith;&quot; sometimes romanized as &quot;Ikret&quot;) was a Palestinian Christian village, located northeast of Acre, in the western Galilee. In October 1948, the village&#x27;s Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled by Zionist forces during the 1948 Palestine war, and the territory later became part of the new State of Israel. All of its Palestinian Christian inhabitants were forced to flee to Lebanon or the Israeli village of Rameh, and, despite the promise that they would be returned in two weeks&#x27; time, the villagers were not allowed to return, and the Israeli army destroyed the village.

In 1951, in response to a plea from the Iqrit villagers, the Israel Supreme Court had ruled that the former residents of Iqrit be allowed to return to their homes. However, before they could, the IDF, despite awareness of the Supreme Court decision, destroyed Iqrit on Christmas Day 1951. Descendants of the villagers maintain an outpost in the village church, and bury their dead in its cemetery. All attempts to cultivate its lands are uprooted by the Israel Lands Administration.

==History==

===Antiquity: archaeological sites===
The Canaanites erected a statue for the god Melqart of Tyre in the village. The village area contains mosaic floors, remains of a wine press, rock-hewn tombs, cisterns, and granite implements. There are many archaeological sites in Iqrit&#x27;s vicinity.

Iqrit is identified with &quot;Yoqeret&quot; or &quot;Yokereth&quot; () a Jewish village mentioned in the Talmud, homeplace of Jose of Yokereth (Babylonian Talmud, Ta&#x27;anit, 23b).

===Crusader period===
When the Crusaders occupied Iqrit, they called it Acref. Açref is a name still commonly used for the village among surrounding Bedouin tribes.

===Ottoman period===
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, Iqrit appeared in the 1596 tax registers as being in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Akka under the Liwa of Safad, with a population of 374 and an economy dependent largely on goats, beehives and agriculture. There was a press used for olives or grapes.

In 1875, Victor Guérin passed by the village and was told that it was &quot;very considerable&quot; and inhabited by Maronites and Greek Orthodox Christians.
In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s (PEF) &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) called it &quot;Akrith&quot;, and described it as a village of stone buildings situated on a tell, with arable land including figs and olives, a modern chapel serving a Christian population of 100, and water supplied by three springs and a dozen rock-cut cisterns.

===British Mandate===
Like a number of other villages in the area, Iqrit was linked to the coastal highway from Acre to Ras an-Naqura via a secondary road leading to Tarbikha. There were 339 people living in 50 houses in the census of 1931, which rose to 490 by the 1945 statistics, comprising 460 Christians and 30 Muslims. There was a total of of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 458 dunams were plantations and irrigable land; 1,088 were used for cereals, while 68 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

At the time of their eviction in November 1948, there were 491 citizens in Iqrit, including 432 Melkites (Greek Catholics), inhabiting the entire area of the village. Some of the 59 Muslims of the village rented their homes in Iqrit while others had built houses in esh-Shafaya.

Only part of the village land was cultivated and the rest was covered with oak, laurel and carob trees. By 1948, the village owned about 600 dunams (600,000 m²) of private property with groves of fig trees that served all inhabitants of Iqrit and the surroundings. The groves covered the hill of al-Bayad, and the remaining cultivated land was used for crops of lentils, as well as tobacco and other fruit trees.

The village included a private elementary school administered by the Greek Catholic Archdiocese and a large Melkite (Greek Catholic) church, the latter of which remains standing. There were two natural water springs, and many wells and a large pool for collected rainwater. There were many threshing floors, mainly located between the built-up village lands and the cemetery.

===1948 war===
Iqrit was captured on 31 October 1948 by the Haganah&#x27;s Oded Brigade during Operation Hiram, an Israeli offensive which advanced on the coastal road towards Lebanon.
Iqrit and Tarbikha surrendered and the villagers stayed in their homes.

Iqrit and a number of other villages in the region were soon affected by a policy known as &quot;an Arabless border strip&quot;. Six days after its surrender, on 5 November 1948, the Israeli Army ordered the villagers to surrender the village and leave, stating that they would be returned in two weeks&#x27; time when the military operations had concluded. Residents departed, anticipating only temporary absence, as had been promised. Some went to Lebanon and the Israeli Army trucked the majority to Rame, a town between Acre and Safad.

According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, the villagers of Iqrit were outright expelled by the Israeli Army in November 1948, together with the villagers of Kafr Bir&#x27;im, Nabi Rubin and Tarbikha, &quot;without Cabinet knowledge, debate, or approval – though, almost inevitably, this received &quot;post facto &quot; Cabinet endorsement.&quot; While some of the former inhabitants of Iqrit became refugees in Lebanon, most are now internally displaced Palestinians who are also citizens of Israel.

===Israel; struggle for return===
====1951 Supreme Court ruling====
The first legal action against the state of Israel was brought in 1951 by 5 men of Iqrit. Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari, acting as their lawyer, was instrumental in gaining the right of return for the men. On 31 July 1951, the Israeli courts recognised the rights of the villagers to their land and their right to return to it. The court said the land was not abandoned and therefore could not be placed under the Custodian of Absentee Property.

In July 1951, the villagers of Iqrit pleaded their case before Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court, and the court ruled in favour of the right to return to their village. After this judgement, the military government found another justification to prevent their return. The villagers appealed to the Supreme Court again and were scheduled to have their case considered on 6 February 1952.

====IDF razes Iqrit====
On Christmas Day 1951, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)
destroyed the village, including its residences and churches. According to the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, Israeli soldiers took the village chief of Iqrit to the top of a nearby hill to force him to watch as Israeli troops conducted explosive demolition of each house in the village. 

====1952 verdict====
In its third verdict, in February 1952, the court blamed the villagers for depending on promises from the military ruler of Galilee, instead of benefiting from the legal remedy which was given to them by the court in its first relevant verdict.

====Return attempts: 1970s–2000s====
In the 1970s, villagers from Iqrit conducted a series of sit-ins in the village&#x27;s former church over a period of six years, and the case of Iqrit (and of Kafr Bir&#x27;im) was frequently covered by the Israeli media. Several prominent Israeli cultural and artistic figures supported the movement to repatriate the Iqrit villagers and public empathy for their plight was widespread. While the Israeli authorities recognized the villagers&#x27; right to return in principle, officials resisted implementing this right. In 1972, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir stated: It is not only consideration of security [that prevents] an official decision regarding Bi&#x27;rim and Iqrit, but the desire to avoid [setting] a precedent. We cannot allow ourselves to become more and more entangled and to reach a point from which we are unable to extricate ourselves.

Meron Benvenisti noted in 2000 how it has been argued that the villagers of Iqrit and Bi&#x27;rim are not the only present absentees in Israel, and therefore recognizing their right of return is perceived as setting a &quot;dangerous precedent&quot; that would be followed by similar demands from other displaced persons. However, Benvenisti argued in 2008 that it could be a positive precedent if the Iqrit villagers were to be allocated the small amount of empty land they need to establish a community settlement on their own land.

In 2003, some of Iqrit&#x27;s villagers repetitioned the Supreme Court so as to facilitate their return to Iqrit, but the petition was rejected by the court. Recently, four families built their houses opposite the village from west, on a side hill of al-Bayad.

===Since 2010===
In August 2012, a large demonstration was held in the city of Haifa demanding Israel to grant the descendants of villagers from Iqrit and Kafr Bir&#x27;im the right of return to the respective villages. Since the last Roots Camp in 2012, a group of the village&#x27;s youth decided to stay in the village and conduct their lives as regular villagers; this came as an act of opposition to the Israeli government&#x27;s continued dismissal of the case.

Iqrit is among the demolished Palestinian villages for which commemorative Marches of Return have taken place, such as those organized by the Association for the Defence of the Rights of the Internally Displaced.

==Within the Arab–Israeli conflict==
===1972 Munich massacre===
The operational name of the Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in 1972 was named by its perpetrators, the Black September Organization, &quot;Iqrit and Bir&#x27;im&quot;, after the two Galilean villages.

===2023 war incident===
On 26 December 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war, an anti-tank missile shot by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon damaged a shed in the Iqrit church compound, but not the church itself. The civilian man in his 80s who was guarding the church suffered moderate wounds. As IDF troops and medical services were working to evacuate him, they were hit by further missiles, which resulted in nine soldiers being wounded, one of them seriously.

==Present buildings and land use==
===Israeli villages===
Following the war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and a number of new Jewish villages were established there, two of them partially on Iqrit&#x27;s land: Shomera (1949; built mainly on the ruins of Tarbikha), and Even Menachem (1960). Gornot HaGalil (1980) followed nearby. At the western entrance of Iqrit, there is now a cowshed that belongs to the moshav of Shomera.

===Iqrit vestiges===
The Melkite Greek Catholic church is the only building of Iqrit which remains standing. The fenced cemetery is annually maintained, on the road to the north. Uncleared rubble from the destroyed houses remains and there are overgrown fig, grape, almond, and olive orchards.

<text>Khirbat Iribbin () or Khurbet &#x27;Arubbin (meaning &quot;The ruin of Arubbin&quot;), was a Palestinian Arab village in the Upper Galilee, located northeast of the city of Acre. In 1945, it had a built-up land area of over 2,000 dunums and a population of 360 Arab Muslims.

==Location==
The village was located on the north bank of Wadi Karkara, about 1 km south of the Lebanese border, and with a view to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.

==History==
A three-aisled Byzantine church (from the 6th or 7th century CE) had been reused as a village house.

===Ottoman era===
In 1875 Victor Guérin inspected the place, which he described: &quot;The ruins of this name are scattered over the flanks and summit of a hill, bordered on the south by the deep ravine of Wady Kerkera. Terraces, once regulated by the hand of man and now overgrown with thick underwood, were formerly covered with dwelling-houses whose remains cumber the soil. The foundations of some are still visible. They were small, but tolerably well-built, with regular stones of fair dimensions.
On the door, still standing, of one of them, we observe a cross with standing, equal arms set in a niche. Besides these, the ruins of a building measuring twenty-six paces long from west to east, and twenty from north to south, deserve particular attention. It was built with cut stones worked in with much care and without cement. The southern facade was pierced with these
doors. Another door, the only one on that side, was constructed in the middle of the western facade; its lintel is lying on the ground. On the east was an apse, whose interior are in place. Within this ancient church are several monolithic columns half hidden by the bushes; they measure 2.50 metres in length, by thirty-five centimetres in diameter. The capitals and the base are wanting, or at all events no longer visible. By the side of this building is observed a sort of subterranean magazine arched in stone with a circular arch. It is partly filled up. On the sumrnit of the hill the vestiges of a town can be recognised. It was approached by a number of steps.&#x27;

===British Mandate era===
In the 1945 statistics, the village (including Arab al-Aramisha, Jurdayh and Khirbat Idmith) had a population of 360 Muslims. A total of 2,637 dunums of village land were used for cereals, and 16 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.

===1948 and aftermath===
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, it was captured by Israel&#x27;s Oded Brigade on October 31, 1948, during Operation Hiram.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. Kibbutz Adamit was founded in 1958 on village land, to the west of the village site. The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village site in 1992: &quot;The site is covered with the debris of houses. It also has a number of wells and caves. The remains of animal shelters are located about away, and about to the east is the rubble of houses used by the Arab al-Qulaytat.&quot;

Petersen inspected the place in 1991, and found that the remains of the village consisted of several widely spaced rectangular houses, one storey high. Most houses were made of rough field stones laid dry, but with traces of older coursed masonry in places. The roofs were flat, made of earth on top of short branches, resting on transverse arches.

<text>Khirbat Jiddin (), known in the Kingdom of Jerusalem as Judin, was an Ottoman fortress in the western Upper Galilee, originally built by the Teutonic Order after 1220 as a crusader castle, 16 km northeast of the city of Acre, which at the time was the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The castle was destroyed by the Mamluk sultan Baibars sometime between 1268-1271 and lay in ruins until being rebuilt and expanded by the Arab ruler Zahir al-Umar as &quot;Qal&#x27;at Jiddin&quot; () in the 1760s, only to be destroyed again around 1775 by Jazzar Pasha. The ruined fortress, known as Khirbat Jiddin, was later inhabited by the al-Suwaytat Bedouin tribe.
According to a 1945 census, there were 1500 Muslims living in the area. Khirbat Jiddin land totaled 7,587 dunums, of which however all but 34 were officially listed as non-cultivable; 4,238 were owned by Arabs and 3,349 dunums owned by Jews. Kibbutz Yehiam was established in the area in 1946. 
Today the remains of the castle are the central part of Yehi&#x27;am Fortress National Park.

==History==
===Byzantine period===
The site was inhabited in the Byzantine period.

===Crusader period===
The Crusaders called the place &quot;Judin&quot; or &quot;Judyn.&quot; A Crusader castle was built there some time after May 1220, when the Teutonic Order acquired the nearby village of Shifaya. The village fell to Sultan Baibars between 1268 and 1271. In 1283, Burchard of Mount Sion described a destroyed castle on the site that had belonged to the Teutonic Order.

Marino Sanuto, in 1322, still referred to it as a castle belonging to the Teutonic Knights.

The castle was built around two towers with an outer enclosure wall.

===Ottoman period===
The fortress as it now exists was built in the eighteenth century by Zahir al-Umar, the Bedouin ruler who became Ottoman governor of the Galilee. It was Zahir al-Umar who had the enclosure walls and towers constructed and the moat hewn out of the bedrock, together with an angled entrance gatehouse, vaulted in a manner faithful to the Crusader style. The vaulted hall on the lower level of the castle was the basement of a palatial residence that included a small mosque and a bathhouse. The hall&#x27;s roof rested on a series of square pillars on the hillside. The walls featured well shafts and gun-slits. The mosque was a small square building originally roofed with four cross-vaults resting on a central pillar. The bathhouse was a small building supplied with water from the wells below.

An Italian, Giovanni Mariti, who visited &quot;Geddin&quot; in the 1760s, says he was given a generous reception by the local sheik who guarded the place for Daher. Jezzar Pasha destroyed the fortress around 1775.

A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as &quot;Chateau de Geddin.&quot;

French explorer Victor Guérin visited in 1875, and described it:

&quot;&#x27;Two great square towers, deprived of their upper stage, are still there, partly upright, and contain several chambers now in very bad condition. The staircases which lead to them have been deprived of part of their steps to make access more difficult. Underneath are magazines and cellars, the vaults of which rest on several ranges of arcades. Cisterns hollowed in the rock are found beneath a paved court. Below and near the castle a second inclosure, flanked by semicircular towers, contains within it the remains of numerous demolished houses and cisterns.&#x27;&quot;

When Kitchener inspected the place in 1877, he found it &quot;quite unoccupied, though there are several chambers and vaults that could serve as habitations.&quot;

===British Mandate===
The ruins were later inhabited by Bedouin of the al-Suwaytat tribe whose primary occupation was animal husbandry. In the 1945 statistics, they also cultivated barley and tobacco on 22 dunums of land. At the same time, Jews cultivated the remaining 32 dunums officially listed as cultivable.

===1948 War and aftermath===
Khirbat Jiddin was part of the territory alloted to a future Arab state in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. On July 11, 1948, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, it was captured by Israel&#x27;s Sheva&#x27; Brigade as part of Operation Dekel.
