<text>Xeon (; ) is a brand of x86 microprocessors designed, manufactured, and marketed by Intel, targeted at the non-consumer workstation, server, and embedded markets. It was introduced in June 1998. Xeon processors are based on the same architecture as regular desktop-grade CPUs, but have advanced features such as support for error correction code (ECC) memory, higher core counts, more PCI Express lanes, support for larger amounts of RAM, larger cache memory and extra provision for enterprise-grade reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) features responsible for handling hardware exceptions through the Machine Check Architecture (MCA). They are often capable of safely continuing execution where a normal processor cannot due to these extra RAS features, depending on the type and severity of the machine-check exception (MCE). Some also support multi-socket systems with two, four, or eight sockets through use of the Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI) bus, which replaced the older QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) bus.
== Branding ==
The &quot;Xeon&quot; brand has been maintained over several generations of IA-32 and x86-64 processors. The P6-based models added the &quot;Xeon&quot; moniker to the end of the name of their corresponding desktop processor, but all models since 2001 used the name &quot;Xeon&quot; on its own. The &quot;Xeon&quot; CPUs generally have more cache and cores than their desktop counterparts in addition to multiprocessing capabilities.

=== Xeon Scalable ===
The Xeon Scalable brand for high-performance server was introduced in May 2017 with the Skylake-based Xeon Platinum 8100 series. Xeon Scalable processors range from dual socket to 8 socket support. Within the Xeon Scalable brand, there exists the hierarchy of Xeon Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.

In April 2024, Intel announced at its Vision event that the Xeon Scalable brand would be retired, beginning with 6th generation Xeon processors codenamed Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids that will now be referred to as &quot;Xeon 6&quot; processors. This change brings greater emphasis on processor generation numbers.

=== Xeon 6 ===
With the launch of Intel&#x27;s Sierra Forest line of processors, branding for mainstream server processors switched to Xeon #, with the # being the generation of the processor, such as Xeon 6 for the 6th generation of Xeon processors, this naming convention also carries over to the Granite Rapids line of server CPUs. 

Xeon 6 is split into two product lines, the E series and P series, which, respectively, are all E core and all P core designs. For example, the Xeon 6 6700E line is an all E core based (Sierra Forest) line of processors.

=== Xeon D ===
Xeon D is targeted towards microserver and edge computing markets with lower power consumption and integrated I/O blocks such as network interface controllers. This allows Xeon D processors to function as SoCs that do not require a separate southbridge PCH. It was announced in 2014 and the first Xeon D processors were released in March 2015. Xeon D processors come in an soldered BGA package rather than in a socketable form factor. Xeon D was introduced to compete with emerging ARM hyperscale server solutions that offered greater multi-threaded performance and power effiency.

=== Xeon W ===
Xeon W branding is used for Xeon workstation processors. It was first introduced in August 2017 with the release of the Skylake-based Xeon W-2100 series workstation processors. With Sapphire Rapids-WS workstation processors that launched in March 2023, Intel introduced tiers within Xeon W. Xeon w3, w5, w7 and w9 was designed to emulate the Core i3, i5, i7 and i9 branding that Intel had been using for its desktop processors.

== Overview ==
Some shortcomings that make Xeon processors unsuitable for most consumer-grade desktop PCs include lower clock rates at the same price point (since servers run more tasks in parallel than desktops, core counts are more important than clock rates), and, usually, the lack of an integrated graphics processing unit (GPU). Processor models prior to Sapphire Rapids-WS lack support for overclocking (with the exception of Xeon W-3175X). Despite such disadvantages, Xeon processors have always had popularity among some desktop users (video editors and other power users), mainly due to higher core count potential, and higher performance to price ratio vs. the Core i7 in terms of total computing power of all cores. Since most Intel Xeon CPUs lack an integrated GPU, systems built with those processors require a discrete graphics card or a separate GPU if computer monitor output is desired.

Intel Xeon is a distinct product line from the similarly named Intel Xeon Phi. The first-generation Xeon Phi is a completely different type of device more comparable to a graphics card; it is designed for a PCI Express slot and is meant to be used as a multi-core coprocessor, like the Nvidia Tesla. In the second generation, Xeon Phi evolved into a main processor more similar to the Xeon. It conforms to the same socket as a Xeon processor and is x86-compatible; however, as compared to Xeon, the design point of the Xeon Phi emphasizes more cores with higher memory bandwidth.

==P6-based Xeon==

===Pentium II Xeon===
The first Xeon-branded processor was the Pentium II Xeon (code-named &quot;Drake&quot;). It was released in 1998, replacing the Pentium Pro in Intel&#x27;s high-end server lineup. The Pentium II Xeon was a &quot;&quot;Deschutes&quot; Pentium II (and shared the same product code: 80523) with a full-speed 512 kB (1 kB = 1024 B), 1 MB (1 MB = 1024 kB = 10242 B), or 2 MB L2 cache. The L2 cache was implemented with custom 512 kB SRAMs developed by Intel. The number of SRAMs depended on the amount of cache. A 512 kB configuration required one SRAM, a 1 MB configuration: two SRAMs, and a 2 MB configuration: four SRAMs on both sides of the PCB. Each SRAM was a 12.90 mm by 17.23 mm (222.21 mm) die fabricated in a 0.35 μm four-layer metal CMOS process and packaged in a cavity-down wire-bonded land grid array (LGA). The additional cache required a larger module and thus the Pentium II Xeon used a larger slot, Slot 2. It was supported by the i440GX dual-processor workstation chipset and the i450NX quad- or octo-processor server chipset.

===Pentium III Xeon===


In 1999, the Pentium II Xeon was replaced by the Pentium III Xeon. Reflecting the incremental changes from the Pentium II &quot;Deschutes&quot; core to the Pentium III &quot;Katmai&quot;&quot; core, the first Pentium III Xeon, named &quot;Tanner&quot;, was just like its predecessor except for the addition of Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) and a few cache controller improvements. The product codes for Tanner mirrored that of &quot;Katmai&quot;; 80525.

The second version, named &quot;Cascades&quot;, was based on the Pentium III &quot;Coppermine&quot; core. The &quot;Cascades&quot; Xeon used a 133 MT/s front side bus and relatively small 256 kB on-die L2 cache resulting in almost the same capabilities as the Slot 1 &quot;Coppermine&quot; processors, which were capable of dual-processor operation but not quad-processor or octa-processor operation.

To improve this situation, Intel released another version, officially also named &quot;Cascades&quot;, but often referred to as &quot;Cascades 2 MB&quot;. That came in two variants: with 1 MB or 2 MB of L2 cache. Its bus speed was fixed at 100 MT/s, though in practice the cache was able to offset this. The product code for Cascades mirrored that of &quot;Coppermine&quot;; 80526.

== NetBurst-based Xeon ==
=== Xeon (DP) and Xeon MP (32-bit) ===
==== Foster ====

In mid-2001, the Xeon brand was introduced (&quot;Pentium&quot; was dropped from the name). The initial variant that used the new NetBurst microarchitecture, &quot;Foster&quot;, was slightly different from the desktop Pentium 4 (&quot;Willamette&quot;). It was a decent chip for workstations, but for server applications it was almost always outperformed by the older Cascades cores with a 2 MB L2 cache and AMD&#x27;s Athlon MP. Combined with the need to use expensive Rambus Dynamic RAM, the Foster&#x27;s sales were somewhat unimpressive.

At most two Foster processors could be accommodated in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system built with a mainstream chipset, so a second version (Foster MP) was introduced with 512 KB or 1 MB L3 cache and the Jackson Hyper-Threading capacity. This improved performance slightly, but not enough to lift it out of third place. It was also priced much higher than the dual-processor (DP) versions. The &quot;Foster&quot; shared the 80528 product code with Willamette.

==== Prestonia ====

In 2002 Intel released a 130 nm version of Xeon branded CPU, codenamed &quot;Prestonia&quot;. It supported Intel&#x27;s new Hyper-Threading technology and had a 512 kB L2 cache. This was based on the &quot;Northwood&quot; Pentium 4 core. A new server chipset, E7500 (which allowed the use of dual-channel DDR SDRAM), was released to support this processor in servers, and soon the bus speed was boosted to 533 MT/s (accompanied by a new socket and two new chipsets: the E7501 for servers and the E7505 for workstations). The &quot;Prestonia&quot; performed much better than its predecessor and noticeably better than Athlon MP. The support of new features in the E75xx series also gave it a key advantage over the Pentium III Xeon and Athlon MP branded CPUs (both stuck with rather old chipsets), and it quickly became the top-selling server/workstation processor.

==== Gallatin ====
Subsequent to the &quot;Prestonia&quot; was the &quot;Gallatin&quot;, which had an L3 cache of 1 MB or 2 MB. Its Xeon MP version, which succeeded &quot;Foster MP&quot;, was popular in servers. Later experience with the 130 nm process allowed Intel to create the Xeon MP branded &quot;Gallatin&quot; with 4 MB cache. The Xeon branded &quot;Prestonia&quot; and &quot;Gallatin&quot; were designated 80532, like Northwood.

===Xeon (DP) and Xeon MP (64-bit)===

====Nocona and Irwindale====
Due to a lack of success with Intel&#x27;s Itanium and Itanium 2 processors, AMD was able to introduce x86-64, a 64-bit extension to the x86 architecture. Intel followed suit by including Intel 64 (formerly EM64T; it is almost identical to AMD64) in the 90 nm version of the Pentium 4 (&quot;Prescott&quot;), and a Xeon version codenamed &quot;Nocona&quot; with 1 MB L2 cache was released in 2004. Released with it were the E7525 (workstation), E7520 and E7320 (both server) chipsets, which added support for PCI Express 1.0a, DDR2 and Serial ATA 1.0a. The Xeon was noticeably slower than AMD&#x27;s Opteron, although it could be faster in situations where Hyper-Threading came into play.

A slightly updated core called &quot;Irwindale&quot; was released in early 2005, with 2 MB L2 cache and the ability to have its clock speed reduced during low processor demand. Although it was a bit more competitive than the &quot;Nocona&quot; had been, independent tests showed that AMD&#x27;s Opteron still outperformed &quot;Irwindale&quot;. Both of these Prescott-derived Xeons have the product code 80546.

==== Cranford and Potomac ====
64-bit Xeon MPs were introduced in April 2005. The cheaper &quot;Cranford&quot; was an MP version of &quot;Nocona&quot;, while the more expensive &quot;Potomac&quot; was a &quot;Cranford&quot; with 8 MB of L3 cache. Like Nocona and Irwindale, they also have product code 80546.

=== Dual-Core Xeon ===
==== &quot;Paxville DP&quot; ====

The first dual-core CPU branded Xeon, codenamed Paxville DP, product code 80551, was released by Intel on October 10, 2005. Paxville DP had NetBurst microarchitecture, and was a dual-core equivalent of the single-core Irwindale (related to the Pentium D branded &quot;Smithfield&quot;) with 4 MB of L2 cache (2 MB per core). The only Paxville DP model released ran at 2.8 GHz, featured an 800 MT/s front side bus, and was produced using a 90 nm process.

==== 7000-series &quot;Paxville MP&quot; ====

An MP-capable version of Paxville, codenamed Paxville MP, product code 80560, was released on November 1, 2005. There are two versions: one with 2 MB of L2 cache (1 MB per core), and one with 4 MB of L2 (2 MB per core). Paxville MP, called the dual-core Xeon 7000-series, was produced using a 90 nm process. Paxville MP clock ranges between 2.67 GHz and 3.0 GHz (model numbers 7020–7041), with some models having a 667 MT/s FSB, and others having an 800 MT/s FSB.

====7100-series &quot;Tulsa&quot;====

Released on August 29, 2006, the 7100 series, codenamed Tulsa (product code 80550), is an improved version of Paxville MP, built on a 65 nm process, with 2 MB of L2 cache (1 MB per core) and up to 16 MB of L3 cache. It uses Socket 604. Tulsa was released in two lines: the N-line uses a 667 MT/s FSB, and the M-line uses an 800 MT/s FSB. The N-line ranges from 2.5 GHz to 3.5 GHz (model numbers 7110N-7150N), and the M-line ranges from 2.6 GHz to 3.4 GHz (model numbers 7110M-7140M). L3 cache ranges from 4 MB to 16 MB across the models.

==== 5000-series &quot;Dempsey&quot; ====

On May 23, 2006, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5000 series) codenamed Dempsey (product code 80555). Released as the Dual-Core Xeon 5000-series, Dempsey is a NetBurst microarchitecture processor produced using a 65 nm process, and is virtually identical to Intel&#x27;s &quot;Presler&quot; Pentium Extreme Edition, except for the addition of SMP support, which lets Dempsey operate in dual-processor systems. Dempsey ranges between 2.50 GHz and 3.73 GHz (model numbers 5020–5080). Some models have a 667 MT/s FSB, and others have a 1066 MT/s FSB. Dempsey has 4 MB of L2 cache (2 MB per core). A Medium Voltage model, at 3.2 GHz and 1066 MT/s FSB (model number 5063), has also been released. Dempsey also introduces a new interface for Xeon processors: LGA 771, also known as Socket J. Dempsey was the first Xeon core in a long time to be somewhat competitive with its Opteron-based counterparts, although it could not claim a decisive lead in any performance metric – that would have to wait for its successor, the Woodcrest.

== Pentium M (Yonah) based Xeon ==
=== LV (ULV), &quot;Sossaman&quot; ===

On March 14, 2006, Intel released a dual-core processor codenamed Sossaman and branded as &quot;Xeon&quot; LV (low-voltage). Subsequently, an ULV (ultra-low-voltage) version was released. The &quot;Sossaman&quot; was a low-/ultra-low-power and double-processor capable CPU (like AMD Quad FX), based on the &quot;&quot;Yonah&quot; processor, for ultradense non-consumer environment (i.e., targeted at the blade-server and embedded markets), and was rated at a thermal design power (TDP) of 31 W (LV: 1.66 GHz, 2 GHz and 2.16 GHz) and 15 W (ULV: 1.66 GHz). As such, it supported most of the same features as earlier Xeons: Virtualization Technology, 667 MT/s front side bus, and dual-core processing, but did not support 64-bit operations, so it could not run 64-bit server software, such as Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, and therefore was limited to 16 GB of memory. A planned successor, codenamed &quot;Merom MP&quot;&quot; was to be a drop-in upgrade to enable &quot;Sossaman&quot;-based servers to upgrade to 64-bit capability. However, this was abandoned in favor of low-voltage versions of the &quot;Woodcrest LV&quot; processor leaving the &quot;Sossaman&quot; at a dead-end with no upgrade path.

== Core-based Xeon ==
=== Dual-Core ===
==== 3000-series &quot;Conroe&quot; ====

The 3000 series, codenamed Conroe (product code 80557) dual-core Xeon (branded) CPU, released at the end of September 2006, was the first Xeon for single-CPU operation and is designed for entry-level uniprocessor servers. The same processor is branded as Core 2 Duo or as Pentium Dual-Core and Celeron, with varying features disabled. They use LGA 775 (Socket T), operate on a 1066 MT/s front-side bus, support Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology and Intel Virtualization Technology but do not support hyper-threading. Conroe processors with a number ending in &quot;5&quot; have a 1333 MT/s FSB.

* Models marked with an asterisk (*) are not present in Intel&#x27;s Ark database.

====3100-series &quot;Wolfdale&quot;====
The 3100 series, codenamed Wolfdale (product code 80570) dual-core Xeon (branded) CPU, was just a rebranded version of the Intel&#x27;s mainstream Core 2 Duo E7000/E8000 and Pentium Dual-Core E5000 processors, featuring the same 45 nm process and 6 MB of L2 cache. Unlike most Xeon processors, they only support single-CPU operation. They use LGA 775 (Socket T), operate on a 1333 MT/s front-side bus, support Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology and Intel Virtualization Technology but do not support Hyper-Threading.

==== 5100-series &quot;Woodcrest&quot; ====

On June 26, 2006, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5100 series) codenamed Woodcrest (product code 80556); it was the first Intel Core/Merom microarchitecture processor to be launched on the market. It is a dual-processor server and workstation version of the Core 2 processor. Intel claimed that it provides an 80% boost in performance, while reducing power consumption by 20% relative to the 5000 series &quot;Dempsey&quot;.

Most models have a 1333MT/s FSB, except for the 5110 and 5120, which have a 1066MT/s FSB. The fastest processor (5160) operates at 3.0GHz. All Woodcrest processors use the LGA 771 (Socket J) socket and all except two models have a TDP of 65W. The 5160 has a TDP of 80W and the 5148LV (2.33GHz) has a TDP of 40W. The previous generation Xeons had a TDP of 130W. All models support Intel 64 (Intel&#x27;s x86-64 implementation), the XD bit, and Virtualization Technology, with the Demand-based switching power management option only on Dual-Core Xeon 5140 or above. Woodcrest has 4 MB of shared L2 cache.

====5200-series &quot;Wolfdale-DP&quot;====

On November 11, 2007, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5200 series) codenamed Wolfdale-DP (product code 80573). It is built on a 45 nm process like the desktop Core 2 Duo and Xeon Wolfdale, featuring Intel 64 (Intel&#x27;s x86-64 implementation), the XD bit, and Virtualization Technology. It is unclear whether the Demand-based switching power management is available on the L5238. Wolfdale has 6 MB of shared L2 cache.

====7200-series &quot;Tigerton&quot;====
The 7200 series, codenamed Tigerton (product code 80564) is an MP-capable processor, similar to the 7300 series, but, in contrast, there is a single dual-core die.

=== Quad-Core and Six-Core Xeon ===
==== 3200-series &quot;Kentsfield &quot;====

Intel released rebranded versions of its quad-core (2×2) Core 2 Quad processor as the Xeon 3200-series (product code 80562) on January 7, 2007. The 2 × 2 &quot;quad-core&quot; (dual-die dual-core) comprised two separate dual-core die next to each other in one CPU package. The models are the X3210, X3220 and X3230, running at 2.13 GHz, 2.4 GHz and 2.66 GHz, respectively. Like the 3000-series, these models only support single-CPU operation and operate on a 1066 MT/s front-side bus. It is targeted at the &quot;blade&quot; market. The X3220 is also branded and sold as Core2 Quad Q6600, the X3230 as Q6700.

==== 3300-series &quot;Yorkfield&quot; ====

Intel released relabeled versions of its quad-core Core 2 Quad Yorkfield Q9300, Q9400, Q9x50 and QX9770 processors as the Xeon 3300-series (product code 80569). This processor comprises two separate dual-core dies next to each other in one CPU package and manufactured in a 45 nm process. The models are the X3320, X3330, X3350, X3360, X3370 and X3380, being rebadged Q9300, Q9400, Q9450, Q9550, Q9650, QX9770, running at 2.50 GHz, 2.66 GHz, 2.66 GHz, 2.83 GHz, 3.0 GHz, and 3.16 GHz, respectively. The L2 cache is a unified 6 MB per die (except for the X3320 and X3330 with a smaller 3 MB L2 cache per die), and a front-side bus of 1333 MHz. All models feature Intel 64 (Intel&#x27;s x86-64 implementation), the XD bit, and Virtualization Technology, as well as Demand-based switching.

The Yorkfield-CL (product code 80584) variant of these processors are X3323, X3353 and X3363. They have a reduced TDP of 80W and are made for single-CPU LGA 771 systems instead of LGA 775, which is used in all other Yorkfield processors. In all other respects, they are identical to their Yorkfield counterparts.

====5300-series &quot;Clovertown&quot;====

A quad-core (2×2) successor of the Woodcrest for DP segment, consisting of two dual-core Woodcrest chips in one package similarly to the dual-core Pentium D branded CPUs (two single-core chips) or the quad-core Kentsfield. All Clovertowns use the LGA 771 package. The Clovertown has been usually implemented with two Woodcrest dies on a multi-chip module, with 8 MB of L2 cache (4 MB per die). Like Woodcrest, lower models use a 1066 MT/s FSB, and higher models use a 1333 MT/s FSB. Intel released Clovertown, product code 80563, on November 14, 2006 with models E5310, E5320, E5335, E5345, and X5355, ranging from 1.6 GHz to 2.66 GHz. All models support MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, Intel 64, XD bit (an NX bit implementation), Intel VT. The E and X designations are borrowed from Intel&#x27;s Core 2 model numbering scheme; an ending of -0 implies a 1066 MT/s FSB, and an ending of -5 implies a 1333 MT/s FSB. All models have a TDP of 80 W with the exception of the X5355, which has a TDP of 120 W, and the X5365, which has a TDP of 150 W. A low-voltage version of Clovertown with a TDP of 50 W has a model numbers L5310, L5320 and L5335 (1.6 GHz, 1.86 GHz and 2.0 GHz respectively). The 3.0 GHz X5365 arrived in July 2007, and became available in the Apple Mac Pro on April 4, 2007. The X5365 performs up to around 38 GFLOPS in the LINPACK benchmark.

==== 5400-series &quot;Harpertown&quot; ====

On November 11, 2007 Intel presented Yorkfield-based Xeons – called Harpertown (product code 80574) – to the public. This family consists of dual die quad-core CPUs manufactured on a 45 nm process and featuring 1066 MHz, 1333 MHz, 1600 MHz front-side buses, with TDP rated from 40 W to 150 W depending on the model. These processors fit in the LGA 771 package. All models feature Intel 64 (Intel&#x27;s x86-64 implementation), the XD bit, and Virtualization Technology. All except the E5405 and L5408 also feature Demand-based switching. The supplementary character in front of the model-number represents the thermal rating: an L depicts a TDP of 40 W or 50 W, an E depicts 80 W whereas an X is 120 W TDP or above. The speed of 3.00 GHz comes as four models, two models with 80 W TDP two other models with 120 W TDP with 1333 MHz or 1600 MHz front-side bus respectively. The fastest Harpertown is the X5492 whose TDP of 150 W is higher than those of the Prescott-based Xeon DP but having twice as many cores. (The X5482 is also sold under the name &quot;Core 2 Extreme QX9775&quot; for use in the Intel Skulltrail system.)

Intel 1.6 GT/s front-side bus Xeon processors will drop into the Intel 5400 (Seaburg) chipset whereas several mainboards featuring the Intel 5000/5200-chipset are enabled to run the processors with a 1333 MHz front-side bus speed. Seaburg features support for dual slots and up to 128 GB of memory.

==== 7300-series &quot;Tigerton QC&quot; ====

The 7300 series, codenamed Tigerton QC (product code 80565) is a four-socket (packaged in Socket 604) and more capable quad-core processor, consisting of two dual core Core 2 architecture silicon chips on a single ceramic module, similar to Intel&#x27;s Xeon 5300 series Clovertown processor modules.

The 7300 series uses Intel&#x27;s Caneland (Clarksboro) platform.

Intel claims the 7300 series Xeons offer more than twice the performance per watt as Intel&#x27;s previous generation 7100 series. The 7300 series&#x27; Caneland chipset provides a point to point interface allowing the full front side bus bandwidth per processor.

The 7xxx series is aimed at the large server market, supporting configurations of up to 32 CPUs per host.
==== 7400-series &quot;Dunnington&quot; ====

Dunnington – the last CPU of the Penryn generation and Intel&#x27;s first multi-core (above two) die – features a single-die six- (or &quot;hexa-&quot;) core design with three unified 3 MB L2 caches (resembling three merged 45 nm dual-core Wolfdale-3M dies), and 96 kB L1 cache (Data) and 16 MB of L3 cache. It features a 1.07 GT/s FSB, fits into the Tigerton&#x27;s mPGA604 socket, and is compatible with both the Intel Caneland and IBM X4 chipsets. These processors support DDR2-1066 (533 MHz), and have a maximum TDP below 130 W. They are intended for blades and other stacked computer systems. Availability was scheduled for the second half of 2008. It was followed shortly by the Nehalem microarchitecture. Total transistor count is 1.9 billion.

Announced on September 15, 2008.
== Nehalem-based Xeon ==
=== 3400-series &quot;Lynnfield&quot; ===
Xeon 3400-series processors based on Lynnfield are designed for entry-level servers compared to Bloomfield, which is designed for uniprocessor workstations. Like Bloomfield, they are quad-core single-package processors based on the Nehalem microarchitecture, but were introduced almost a year later, in September 2009. The same processors are marketed for mid-range to high-end desktops systems as Core i5 and Core i7. They have two integrated memory channels as well as PCI Express and Direct Media Interface (DMI) links, but no QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) interface.

=== 3400-series &quot;Clarkdale&quot; ===

At low end of the 3400-series is not a Lynnfield but a Clarkdale processor, which is also used in the Core i3-500 and Core i5-600 processors as well as the Celeron G1000 and G6000 Pentium series. A single model was released in March 2010, the Xeon L3406. Compared to all other Clarkdale-based products, this one does not support integrated graphics, but has a much lower thermal design power of just 30 W. Compared to the Lynnfield-based Xeon 3400 models, it only offers two cores.

=== W3500-series &quot;Bloomfield&quot; ===

Bloomfield (or Nehalem-E) is the codename for the successor to the Xeon 3300 series, is based on the Nehalem microarchitecture and uses the same 45 nm manufacturing methods as Intel&#x27;s Penryn. The first processor released with the Nehalem architecture is the high-end desktop Core i7, which was released in November 2008. This is the server version for single CPU systems.
This is a single-socket Intel Xeon processor designed for uniprocessor workstations.

The performance improvements over the previous Xeon 3300 series are based mainly on:
* Integrated memory controller supporting three memory channels of DDR3 UDIMM (Unbuffered) or RDIMM (Registered)
* A new point-to-point processor interconnect &quot;QuickPath&quot;, replacing the legacy front side bus
* Simultaneous multithreading by multiple cores and hyper-threading (2× per core).
* Turbo Boost, an overclocking technology that allows the CPU to run at a clock speed higher than the base speed as needed

=== 5500-series &quot;Gainestown&quot; ===

Gainestown or Nehalem-EP (Efficient Performance), the successor to Wolfdale-DP, and Harpertown, is based on the Nehalem microarchitecture and uses the same 45 nm manufacturing methods. The first processor released with the Nehalem microarchitecture is the high-end desktop Core i7, which was released in November 2008. Server processors of the Xeon 55xx range were first supplied to testers in December 2008.

The performance improvements over Wolfdale-DP and Harpertown processors are based mainly on:
* Monolithic design for quad-core models
* Integrated memory controller supporting three memory channels of DDR3 memory with ECC support.
* A new point-to-point processor interconnect &quot;QuickPath&quot;, replacing the legacy front side bus. Gainestown has two QuickPath interfaces.
* Hyper-threading (2× per core, starting from 5518), that was already present in NetBurst-based processors
* Turbo Boost, an overclocking technology that allows the CPU to run at a clock speed higher than the base speed as needed

=== C3500/C5500-series &quot;Jasper Forest&quot; ===

Jasper Forest is a Nehalem-based embedded processor with PCI Express connections on-die, core counts from 1 to 4 cores and power envelopes from 23 to 85 watts.

The uni-processor version without QPI comes as LC35xx and EC35xx, while the dual-processor version is sold as LC55xx and EC55xx and uses QPI for communication between the processors. Both versions use a DMI link to communicate with the 3420 that is also used in the 3400-series Lynfield Xeon processors, but use an LGA 1366 package that is otherwise used for processors with QPI but no DMI or PCI Express links. The CPUID code of both Lynnfield and Jasper forest is 106Ex, i.e., family 6, model 30.

The Celeron P1053 belongs into the same family as the LC35xx series, but lacks some RAS features that are present in the Xeon version.

=== W3600/5600-series &quot;Gulftown&quot; &amp; &quot;Westmere-EP&quot; ===
Gulftown and Westmere-EP, six-core 32 nm architecture Westmere-based processors, are the basis for the Xeon 36xx and 56xx series and the Core i7-980X. It launched in the first quarter of 2010. The 36xx-series follows the 35xx-series Bloomfield uni-processor model while the 56xx-series follows the 55xx-series Gainestown dual-processor model and both are socket compatible to their predecessors.
=== 6500/7500-series &quot;Beckton&quot; ===

Beckton or Nehalem-EX (Expandable server market) is a Nehalem-based processor with up to eight cores and uses buffering inside the chipset to support up to 16 standard DDR3 DIMMs per CPU socket without requiring the use of FB-DIMMs. Unlike all previous Xeon MP processors, Nehalem-EX uses the new LGA 1567 (Socket LS) package, replacing the Socket 604 used in the previous models, up to Xeon 7400 &quot;Dunnington&quot;. The 75xx models have four QuickPath interfaces, so it can be used in up-to eight-socket configurations, while the 65xx models are only for up to two sockets. Designed by the Digital Enterprise Group (DEG) Santa Clara and Hudson Design Teams, Beckton is manufactured on the P1266 (45 nm) technology. Its launch in March 2010 coincided with that of its direct competitor, AMD&#x27;s Opteron 6xxx &quot;Magny-Cours&quot;.

Most models limit the number of cores and QPI links as well as the L3 cache size in order to get a broader range of products out of the single chip design.

===E7-x8xx-series &quot;Westmere-EX&quot;===
Westmere-EX is the follow-on to Beckton/Nehalem-EX and the first Intel processor to have ten CPU cores. The microarchitecture is the same as in the six-core Gulftown/Westmere-EP processor, but it uses the LGA 1567 package like Beckton to support up to eight sockets.

Starting with Westmere-EX, the naming scheme has changed once again, with &quot;E7-xxxx&quot; now signifying the high-end line of Xeon processors using a package that supports larger than two-CPU configurations, formerly the 7xxx series. Similarly, the 3xxx uniprocessor and 5xxx dual-processor series turned into E3-xxxx and E5-xxxx, respectively, for later processors.

==Sandy Bridge- and Ivy Bridge-based Xeon==

=== E3-12xx-series &quot;Sandy Bridge&quot; ===
The Xeon E3-12xx line of processors, introduced in April 2011, uses the Sandy Bridge chips that are also the base for the Core i3/i5/i7-2xxx and Celeron/Pentium Gxxx products using the same LGA 1155 socket, but with a different set of features disabled. Notably, the Xeon variants include support for ECC memory, VT-d and trusted execution that are not present on the consumer models, while only some Xeon E3 enable the integrated GPU that is present on Sandy Bridge. Like its Xeon 3400-series predecessors, the Xeon E3 only supports operation with a single CPU socket and is targeted at entry-level workstations and servers. The CPUID of this processor is 0206A7h, the product code is 80623.

=== E3-12xx v2-series &quot;Ivy Bridge&quot; ===

Xeon E3-12xx v2 is a minor update of the Sandy Bridge-based E3-12xx, using the 22 nm shrink, and providing slightly better performance while remaining backwards compatible. They were released in May 2012 and mirror the desktop Core i3/i5/i7-3xxx parts.

=== E5-14xx/24xx series &quot;Sandy Bridge-EN&quot; and E5-16xx/26xx/46xx-series &quot;Sandy Bridge-EP&quot; ===
The Xeon E5-16xx processors follow the previous Xeon 3500/3600-series products as the high-end single-socket platform, using the LGA 2011 package introduced with this processor. They share the Sandy Bridge-E platform with the single-socket Core i7-38xx and i7-39xx processors. The CPU chips have no integrated GPU but eight CPU cores, some of which are disabled in the entry-level products. The Xeon E5-26xx line has the same features but also enables multi-socket operation like the earlier Xeon 5000-series and Xeon 7000-series processors.

=== E5-14xx v2/24xx v2 series &quot;Ivy Bridge-EN&quot; and E5-16xx v2/26xx v2/46xx v2 series &quot;Ivy Bridge-EP&quot; ===
The Xeon E5 v2 line was an update, released in September 2013 to replace the original Xeon E5 processors with a variant based on the Ivy Bridge shrink. The maximum number of CPU cores was raised to 12 per processor module and the total L3 cache was upped to 30 MB. The consumer version of the Xeon E5-16xx v2 processor is the Core i7-48xx and 49xx.

=== E7-28xx v2/48xx v2/88xx v2 series &quot;Ivy Bridge-EX&quot; ===
The Xeon E7 v2 line was an update, released in February 2014 to replace the original Xeon E7 processors with a variant based on the Ivy Bridge shrink. There was no Sandy Bridge version of these processors but rather a Westmere version.

== Haswell-based Xeon ==
=== E3-12xx v3 series &quot;Haswell-WS&quot; ===

Introduced in May 2013, Xeon E3-12xx v3 is the first Xeon series based on the Haswell microarchitecture. It uses the new LGA 1150 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Haswell processors, incompatible with the LGA 1155 that was used in Xeon E3 and E3 v2. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory in the Xeon-branded parts. The main benefit of the new microarchitecture is better power efficiency.

=== E5-16xx/26xx v3 series &quot;Haswell-EP&quot; ===

Introduced in September 2014, Xeon E5-16xx v3 and Xeon E5-26xx v3 series use the new LGA 2011-v3 socket, which is incompatible with the LGA 2011 socket used by earlier Xeon E5 and E5 v2 generations based on Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge microarchitectures. Some of the main benefits of this generation, compared to the previous one, are improved power efficiency, higher core counts, and bigger last level caches (LLCs). Following the already used nomenclature, Xeon E5-26xx v3 series allows dual-socket operation.

One of the new features of this generation is that Xeon E5 v3 models with more than 10 cores support cluster on die (COD) operation mode, allowing CPU&#x27;s multiple columns of cores and LLC slices to be logically divided into what is presented as two non-uniform memory access (NUMA) CPUs to the operating system. By keeping data and instructions local to the &quot;partition&quot; of CPU which is processing them, thus decreasing the LLC access latency, COD brings performance improvements to NUMA-aware operating systems and applications.

=== E7-48xx/88xx v3 series &quot;Haswell-EX&quot; ===

Introduced in May 2015, Xeon E7-48xx v3 and Xeon E7-88xx v3 series provide higher core counts, higher per-core performance and improved reliability features, compared to the previous Xeon E7 v2 generation. Following the usual SKU nomenclature, Xeon E7-48xx v3 and E7-88xx v3 series allow multi-socket operation, supporting up to quad- and eight-socket configurations, respectively. These processors use the LGA 2011 (R1) socket.

Xeon E7-48xx v3 and E7-88xx v3 series contain a quad-channel integrated memory controller (IMC), supporting both DDR3 and DDR4 LRDIMM or RDIMM memory modules through the use of &quot;Jordan Creek&quot; (DDR3) or &quot;Jordan Creek 2&quot; (DDR4) memory buffer chips. Both versions of the memory buffer chip connect to the processor using version 2.0 of the Intel Scalable Memory Interconnect (SMI) interface, while supporting lockstep memory layouts for improved reliability. Up to four memory buffer chips can be connected to a processor, with up to six DIMM slots supported per each memory buffer chip.

Xeon E7-48xx v3 and E7-88xx v3 series also contain functional bug-free support for Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX), which was disabled via a microcode update in August 2014 for Haswell-E, Haswell-WS (E3-12xx v3) and Haswell-EP (E5-16xx/26xx v3) models, due to a bug that was discovered in the TSX implementation.

== Broadwell-based Xeon ==
=== E3-12xx v4 series &quot;Broadwell-H&quot; ===
Introduced in June 2015, Xeon E3-12xx v4 is the first Xeon series based on the Broadwell microarchitecture. It uses LGA 1150 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Haswell processors. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory in the Xeon-branded parts. The main benefit of the new microarchitecture is the new lithography process, which results in better power efficiency.

== Skylake-based Xeon ==
=== E3-12xx v5 series &quot;Skylake-S&quot; ===
Introduced in October 2015, Xeon E3-12xx v5 is the first Xeon series based on the Skylake microarchitecture. It uses new LGA 1151 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Skylake processors. Although it uses the same socket as consumer processors, it is limited to the C200 server chipset series and will not work with consumer chipsets like Z170. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory in the Xeon-branded parts.

=== 1st generation Xeon Scalable &quot;Skylake-SP&quot; ===
== Kaby Lake-based Xeon ==
=== E3-12xx v6 series ===
Introduced in January 2017, Xeon E3-12xx v6 is the first Xeon series based on the Kaby Lake microarchitecture. It uses the same LGA 1151 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Kaby Lake processors. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory and improved energy efficiency in the Xeon-branded parts.

==Supercomputers==

By 2013 Xeon processors were ubiquitous in supercomputers—more than 80% of the TOP500 machines in 2013 used them. For the fastest machines, much of the performance comes from compute accelerators; Intel&#x27;s entry into that market was the Xeon Phi, the first machines using it appeared in June 2012 and by June 2013 it was used in the fastest computer in the world.

* The first Xeon-based machines in the top-10 appeared in November 2002, two clusters at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and at NOAA.
* The first Xeon-based machine to be in the first place of the TOP500 was the Chinese Tianhe-IA in November 2010, which used a mixed Xeon-Nvidia GPU configuration; it was overtaken by the Japanese K computer in 2012, but the Tianhe-2 system using 12-core Xeon E5-2692 processors and Xeon Phi cards occupied the first place in both TOP500 lists of 2013.
* The SuperMUC system, using eight-core Xeon E5-2680 processors but no accelerator cards, managed fourth place in June 2012 and had dropped to tenth by November 2013
* Xeon processor-based systems are among the top 20 fastest systems by memory bandwidth as measured by the STREAM benchmark.
* An Intel Xeon virtual SMP system using ScaleMP&#x27;s Versatile SMP (vSMP) architecture with 128 cores and 1 TiB RAM. This system aggregates 16 Stoakley platform (Seaburg chipset) systems with total of 32 Harpertown processors.

<doc id="269921" wikidata="Q1284570" url="?curid=269921" title="M.U.L.E.">
<text>M.U.L.E. is a multiplayer video game written for Atari 8-bit computers by Ozark Softscape. Designer Danielle Bunten Berry (credited as Dan Bunten) takes advantage of the four joystick ports of the Atari 400 and 800 to allow four-player simultaneous play. Published in 1983, &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; was one of the first five games from new company Electronic Arts, alongside &quot;Axis Assassin&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Worms?&quot;, and &quot;Hard Hat Mack&quot;. It is primarily a turn-based strategy game, but incorporates real-time elements where players compete directly as well as aspects that simulate economics.

The game was ported to the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, and IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk). Japanese versions exist for the PC-88, Sharp X1, and MSX2 computers. Like the subsequent Atari 8-bit models, none of these systems allow four players with separate joysticks. The Commodore 64 version lets four players share joysticks, with two players using the keyboard during action portions.

== Gameplay ==
Set on the fictional planet Irata (&quot;Atari&quot; backward), the game is an exercise in supply and demand economics involving competition among four players, with computer opponents automatically filling in for any missing players. Players choose the race of their colonist, which has advantages and disadvantages that can be paired to their respective strategies. To win, players not only compete against each other to amass the largest amount of wealth, but must also cooperate for the survival of the colony.

Central to the game is the acquisition and use of &quot;Multiple Use Labor Elements&quot;, or &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot;s, to develop and harvest resources from the player&#x27;s real estate. Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the &quot;Tournament&quot; level). Players must balance supply and demand of these elements, buying what they need and selling what they don&#x27;t. Players may exploit or create shortages by refusing to sell to other players or to the &quot;store&quot;, which raises the price of the resource on the following turns. Scheming between players is encouraged by allowing collusion, which initiates a mode allowing a private transaction. Crystite is the one commodity that is not influenced by supply and demand considerations, being deemed to be sold off-world, so the strategy with this resource is somewhat different; a player may attempt to maximize production without fear of having too much supply for the demand.
Each resource is required to do certain things on each turn. For instance, if a player is short on Food, there is less time to take one&#x27;s turn. If a player is short on Energy, some land plots won&#x27;t produce any output, while a shortage of Smithore raises the price of M.U.L.E.s and prevents the store from manufacturing new M.U.L.E.s.

Players must deal with periodic random events such as runaway M.U.L.E.s, sunspot activity, theft by space pirates, and meteorites, with potentially destructive and beneficial effects. Favorable random events almost never happen to the player currently in first place, while unfavorable events never happen to the player in last place. Similarly, when two players want to buy a resource at the same price, the player in the losing position automatically wins. Players also can hunt the mountain wampus for a cash reward.

== Development ==

According to Jim Rushing (one of the four original partners in Ozark Softscape), &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; was initially called &quot;Planet Pioneers&quot; during development. It was intended to be similar to &quot;Cartels &amp; Cutthroats&quot;, with more graphics, better playability, and a focus on multiplayer. The real-time auction element came largely from lead designer Danielle Bunten&#x27;s &quot;Wheeler Dealers&quot;. The board game &quot;Monopoly&quot; was used as a model for the game because of its encouragement of social interaction and for several of the game&#x27;s elements: the acquisition and development of land as a primary task, a production advantage for grouped plots, different species (à la the different player tokens), and random events similar to &quot;Chance&quot; cards. Additional game features such as claim jumping, loans, and crystite depletion were discarded for adding complexity without enhancing gameplay.

The setting was inspired by Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, wherein galactic colonization is in the style of the American Old West: A few pioneers with drive and primitive tools. The M.U.L.E. itself is based on the idea of the genetically modified animal in Heinlein&#x27;s novel and given the appearance of a &quot;Star Wars&quot; Imperial Walker. Another Heinlein novel, &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, provided the decision to not have any government or external authority. In the game&#x27;s original designs, land was sold by auction, but this caused a feedback loop in which the wealthiest player had the most land and thus made the most money; thus, the developers created the &quot;land authority&quot; that gives each player a free plot of land each turn.

Ozark Softscape developed the game for Atari 8-bit computers first because of its policy of developing for the most advanced computers then porting them to other platforms, removing or altering features such as sprites as necessary. Bunten stated that Ozark did not port the game to the Apple II because &quot;&quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; can&#x27;t be done for an Apple&quot;. The IBM PC port of &quot;M.U.L.E&quot; was developed by K-Byte Software, an affiliate of Electronic Arts, and published by IBM.

== Reception ==
&quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; only sold 30,000 copies but was lauded by reviewers.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described it as a &quot;fascinating and very enjoyable game which comes to its very best point with four human players&quot;. Minor criticisms included too-weak computer opponents and the lack of a save feature. Praising the &quot;human engineering&quot; that created the Atari 8-bit version&#x27;s user interface, the magazine called it &quot;All in all, a superior game&quot;. &quot;Softline&quot; called &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; &quot;what computer games should be like. It&#x27;s a game, and it&#x27;s a learning experience. It&#x27;s also stimulating, fun, frustrating, thought provoking, fun, addictive, and fun&quot;. The magazine praised it as offering &quot;valuable lessons&quot; on economic topics, noting that &quot;Most of them are learned the hard way&quot;, and concluded that &quot;The game &quot;feels&quot; good&quot; and &quot;virtually flawless&quot; because of the human-computer and human-human competition.

John J. Anderson wrote in &quot;Creative Computing&quot;, &quot;I should also mention that there is no shooting to be found anywhere in the game. How positively refreshing ... Mule belongs on every Atari software shelf in the world: in every home and every school, near every Atari.&quot;

Scott Mace of &quot;InfoWorld&quot; called &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; unusual in the ease with which it allows multiplayer interaction through a single game computer console. He wrote that it would have &quot;incredible lasting power, just like the best of the board games&quot; and stated &quot;I learned more about the economics of the marketplace from M.U.L.E. than I ever did in college&quot;. Leo Laporte of &quot;Hi-Res&quot; also said that he learned more economics from the game than during college. He predicted that &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; &quot;may revitalize the [video game] industry. It ought to make them rich anyway&quot;, praised its theme as &quot;most captivating musical come-on I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;, and concluded &quot;If you ask me, &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; is the perfect game.&quot;

Reporting in &quot;BYTE&quot; that his children loved it, Jerry Pournelle described &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; as &quot;a cross between &quot;Hammurabi&quot;, &quot;Diplomacy&quot;, and an arcade game, with lots of strategic decisions—provided that you&#x27;re skillful enough with a joystick to implement what you&#x27;ve decided to do&quot;. Another reviewer wrote in the magazine that &quot;it is impossible to adequately describe all the interaction and economically realistic subtleties of M.U.L.E.&quot;, concluding that it was &quot;an intriguing way to illustrate some of the triumphs and perils of free enterprise&quot;. Orson Scott Card in &quot;Compute!&quot; in 1983 gave &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; and two other EA games, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Worms?&quot;, complimentary reviews, writing that &quot;they are original; they do what they set out to do very, very well; they allow the player to take part in the creativity; they do things that only computers can do&quot;. The magazine listed the game in May 1988 as one of &quot;Our Favorite Games&quot;, stating that it &quot;requires a sense of strategy as well as proficiency at joystick maneuvers&quot;.

Steven A. List reviewed &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 70. He commented that &quot;&quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; is simply a great game, a &quot;tour de force&quot; in programming and design, good family entertainment, educational and exciting. If you don&#x27;t have a computer and disk drive, it may be worth the investment just to be able to play this.&quot; &quot;The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984&quot; gave the game an overall A rating, stating that it &quot;combines some of the best features of &quot;Monopoly&quot; with economic simulation games like [Hammurabi]&quot; while teaching &quot;valuable lessons in economies in a fun way&quot;. The book noted that &quot;when several people play, the game becomes involved and interactive&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; said the game &quot;towers over the rest&quot;. The magazine regretted Atari discontinuing computers with four joystick ports: &quot;Four-player M.U.L.E. is a unique entertainment experience for the whole family, and it gives us a glimpse of the true promise of the home computer to take us to simulated worlds. Even two-player M.U.L.E. is a delight&quot;. Two of &quot;Zzap!64&quot;″s reviewers stated in 1985 that &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; was &quot;an excellent trading game&quot; and &quot;recommended for both novice and skilled&quot;, while the third complained that he &quot;found little [excitement] ... nothing to keep me interested&quot;.

In 1984 &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; was awarded &quot;1984 Best Multi-Player Video Game/Computer Game&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards where judges described it as &quot;a unique blend of boardgame strategy and computer-game pacing&quot; and noted that &quot;since its release, &#x27;M.U.L.E.&#x27; has gained an intense cult following&quot;. &quot;Softline&quot; readers named the game the third most-popular Atari program of 1983. With a score of 7.44 out of 10, in 1988 &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; was among the first members of the &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; Hall of Fame, honoring those games rated highly over time by readers. In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games the magazine gave the title five of five stars, calling it &quot;An all-time computer classic, this was one of the only games ever devised that was playable and entertaining for four humans. Economics made fun! ... it still holds up well over all these years and, by itself, provides justification for holding onto the 8-bit Atari&quot;. In 1996, the magazine named &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; as #3 on its Best Games of All Time list. In 2004, &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. It was named #5 of the &quot;Ten Greatest PC Games Ever&quot; by &quot;PC World&quot; in 2009. &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; was listed as the 19th most important video game of all time by 1UP.com. Chris Crawford said of the game that considering the platform the team had to deal with, &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; was &quot;the greatest game design ever done.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Shigeru Miyamoto cited &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; as an influence on the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series. Will Wright dedicated his game &quot;The Sims&quot; to the memory of Bunten. The &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; theme song was included in Wright&#x27;s later game, &quot;Spore&quot;, as an Easter egg in the space stage.

A 2007 remix of the theme song by 8 Bit Weapon is used in the video game &quot;Roblox&quot;.

An ability in &quot;StarCraft II&quot; allows Terran players to deploy temporary robotic workers called M.U.L.E.s.

A board game adaptation, &quot;M.U.L.E. The Board Game&quot;, was released in 2015.

Unofficial clones are &quot;Subtrade&quot;, &quot;Traders&quot;, and &quot;Space HoRSE&quot;.

===Enhanced versions===
In 2005, a netplay component was integrated into the Atari800WinPlus emulator enabling the original game to be played over the Internet.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; printed in April 1994 that EA &quot;was working on a videogame version of the game, but the design was terminated because of creative differences between the publisher and the designer&quot;. The magazine reported a rumor in May 1994 that a &quot;Genesis version has been completed, but EA is debating over its release&quot;, and then in August 1994 that Bunten had decided against remaking the game because EA &quot;wanted me to put in guns and bombs&quot;. An editorial asked the company to &quot;give us &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; with Smithore and Crystite as its creator intended&quot;. Bunten was working on an Internet version of &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; until her death in 1998.

An online, licensed remake called &quot;Planet M.U.L.E.&quot; was released in 2009. The game is free for download for major platforms. Comma 8 Studios later acquired the mobile &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; license and released &quot;M.U.L.E. Returns&quot; for iOS in November 2013.

The source code to &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot;, believed lost, was revealed in 2020 to be in the possession of Julian Eggebrecht. In the 1980s he had pitched an enhanced 16-bit version of the game. EA accepted the idea and sent him two discs with the source code of the original.

Another officially licensed version called &quot;M.U.L.E. Online&quot; was released via the itch.io platform on May 30, 2023. This version faithfully recreates the Atari 8-bit version of the game with both local and online multiplayer included and enhanced keyboard, mouse, and gamepad controls. It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

<doc id="269927" wikidata="Q7271541" url="?curid=269927" title="Questionnaire construction">
<text>Questionnaire construction refers to the design of a questionnaire to gather statistically useful information about a given topic. When properly constructed and responsibly administered, questionnaires can provide valuable data about any given subject.

==Questionnaires==

Questionnaires are frequently used in quantitative marketing research and social research. They are a valuable method of collecting a wide range of information from a large number of individuals, often referred to as respondents.

What is often referred to as &quot;adequate questionnaire construction&quot; is critical to the success of a survey. Inappropriate questions, incorrect ordering of questions, incorrect scaling, or a bad questionnaire format can make the survey results valueless, as they may not accurately reflect the views and opinions of the participants.

Different methods can be useful for checking a questionnaire and making sure it is accurately capturing the intended information. Initial advice may include:
* consulting subject-matter experts
* using questionnaire construction guidelines to inform drafts, such as the Tailored Design Method, or those produced by National Statistical Organisations.

Empirical tests also provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:
* conducting cognitive interviewing. By asking a sample of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can 
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest, quasi-simplex, or mutlitrait-multimethod models.
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).

==Test items==
In the realm of psychological testing and questionnaires, an individual task or question is referred to as a test Item or item. These items serve as fundamental components within questionnaire and psychological tests, often tied to a specific latent psychological construct (see operationalization). Each item produces a value, typically a raw score, which can be aggregated across all items to generate a composite score for the measured trait.

Test items generally encompass three primary components:

# Item stem: This represents the question, statement, or task presented.
# Answer format: The manner in which the respondent provides an answer, including options for multiple-choice questions.
# Evaluation criteria: The criteria used to assess and score the response.

The degree of standardization varies, ranging from strictly prescribed questions with predetermined answers to open-ended questions with subjective evaluation criteria.

Responses to test items serve as indicators in the realm of social sciences.

==Types of questions==
Questions, or items, may be:
* Closed-ended questions – Respondents&#x27; answers are limited to a fixed set of responses.
** Yes/no questions – The respondent answers with a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;.
** Multiple choice – The respondent has several option from which to choose.
** Scaled questions – Responses are graded on a continuum (e.g.: rate the appearance of the product on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most preferred appearance). Examples of types of scales include the Likert scale, semantic differential scale, and rank-order scale. (See scale for further information)
** Matrix questions – Identical response categories are assigned to multiple questions. The questions are placed one under the other, forming a matrix with response categories along the top and a list of questions down the side. This is an efficient use of page space and the respondents&#x27; time.
* Open-ended questions – No options or predefined categories are suggested. The respondent supplies their own answer without being constrained by a fixed set of possible responses. Examples include:
** Completely unstructured – For example, &quot;What is your opinion on questionnaires?&quot;
** Word association – Words are presented and the respondent mentions the first word that comes to mind.
** Sentence completion – Respondents complete an incomplete sentence. For example, &quot;The most important consideration in my decision to buy a new house is...&quot;
** Story completion – Respondents complete an incomplete story.
** Picture completion – Respondents fill-in an empty speech balloon.
** Thematic apperception test – Respondents explain a picture or create a story about what they think is happening in the picture.
* Contingency question – A question that is answered only if the respondent gives a particular response to a previous question. This avoids asking questions of people that do not apply to them (for example, asking men if they have ever been pregnant).

==Multi-item scales==

Within social science research and practice, questionnaires are most frequently used to collect quantitative data using multi-item scales with the following characteristics:
* Multiple statements or questions (minimum ≥3; usually ≥5) are presented for each variable being examined.
* Each statement or question has an accompanying set of equidistant response-points (usually 5-7).
* Each response point has an accompanying verbal anchor (e.g., “strongly agree”) ascending from left to right.
* Verbal anchors should be balanced to reflect equal intervals between response-points.
* Collectively, a set of response-points and accompanying verbal anchors are referred to as a rating scale. One very frequently-used rating scale is a Likert scale.
* Usually, for clarity and efficiency, a single set of anchors is presented for multiple rating scales in a questionnaire.
* Collectively, a statement or question with an accompanying rating scale is referred to as an item.
* When multiple items measure the same variable in a reliable and valid way, they are collectively referred to as a multi-item scale, or a psychometric scale.
* The following types of reliability and validity should be established for a multi-item scale: internal reliability, test-retest reliability (if the variable is expected to be stable over time), content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity. 
* Factor analysis is used in the scale development process.
* Questionnaires used to collect quantitative data usually comprise several multi-item scales, together with an introductory and concluding section.

==Pretesting==

Pretesting is testing and evaluating whether a questionnaire causes problems that could affect data quality and data collection for interviewers or survey respondents. 

Pretesting methods can be quantitative or qualitative, and can be conducted in a laboratory setting or in the field.

* Cognitive interviewing examines the respondent&#x27;s thought process as they answer the questions or afterwards. The interviewer directs the respondent to think aloud or administer verbal probes. It can also be conducted online without an interviewer.
* Usability testing focuses on how people interact with the survey, such as navigating the survey, entering survey responses, and finding help information.
* Vignettes are short descriptions of hypothetical situations that are presented to research participants to examine their survey-relevant decisions.
* Behavioral coding (or behavior coding) monitors the interviewer and respondent&#x27; verbal interactions in live or recorded interviews, or from transcripts. Questions are identified as needing repair when certain behaviors are coded frequently, such as respondents asking for clarifications.
* Expert review is conducted by an individual expert or a panel of experts in questionnaire design to identify potential problems and solutions.
* Experimental comparisons test the impact of the revised items by comparing it with the original items.
* Statistical modeling applies methods such as latent class analysis and item response theory.
A multiple-method approach helps to triangulate results. For example, cognitive interviews, usability testing, behavior coding, and/or vignettes can be combined for pretesting.

==Questionnaire construction issues==
Before constructing a questionnaire survey, it is advisable to consider how the results of the research will be used. If the results won&#x27;t influence the decision-making process, budgets won&#x27;t allow implementing the findings, or the cost of research outweighs its usefulness, then there is little purpose in conducting the research.

The research objective(s) and frame-of-reference should be defined beforehand, including the questionnaire&#x27;s context of time, budget, manpower, intrusion and privacy. The types of questions (e.g.: closed, multiple-choice, open) should fit the data analysis techniques available and the goals of the survey.

The manner (random or not) and location (sampling frame) for selecting respondents will determine whether the findings will be representative of the larger population.

The level of measurement – known as the scale, index, or typology – will determine what can be concluded from the data. A yes/no question will only reveal how many of the sample group answered yes or no, lacking the resolution to determine an average response. The nature of the expected responses should be defined and retained for interpretation.

A common method is to &quot;research backwards&quot; in building a questionnaire by first determining the information sought (i.e., Brand A is more/less preferred by &quot;x%&quot; of the sample vs. Brand B, and &quot;y%&quot; vs. Brand C), then being certain to ask all the needed questions to obtain the metrics for the report. Unneeded questions should be avoided, as they are an expense to the researcher and an unwelcome imposition on the respondents. All questions should contribute to the objective(s) of the research.

Topics should fit the respondents&#x27; frame of reference, as their background may affect their interpretation of the questions. Respondents should have enough information or expertise to answer the questions truthfully. Writing style should be conversational, yet concise and accurate and appropriate to the target audience and subject matter. The wording should be kept simple, without technical or specialized vocabulary. Ambiguous words, equivocal sentence structures and negatives may cause misunderstanding, possibly invalidating questionnaire results. Double negatives should be reworded as positives.

If a survey question actually contains more than one issue, the researcher will not know which one the respondent is answering. Care should be taken to ask one question at a time.

Questions and prepared responses (for multiple-choice) should be neutral as to intended outcome. A biased question or questionnaire encourages respondents to answer one way rather than another. Even questions without bias may leave respondents with expectations. The order or grouping of questions is also relevant; early questions may bias later questions. Loaded questions evoke emotional responses and may skew results.

The list of prepared responses should be collectively exhaustive; one solution is to use a final write-in category for &quot;other ________&quot;. The possible responses should also be mutually exclusive, without overlap. Respondents should not find themselves in more than one category, for example in both the &quot;married&quot; category and the &quot;single&quot; category (in such a case there may be need for separate questions on marital status and living situation).

Many people will not answer personal or intimate questions. For this reason, questions about age, income, marital status, etc. are generally placed at the end of the survey. This way, even if the respondent refuses to answer these questions, he/she will have already answered the research questions.

Visual presentation of the questions on the page (or computer screen) and use of white space, colors, pictures, charts, or other graphics may affect respondent&#x27;s interest – or distract from the questions. There are four primary design elements: words (meaning), numbers (sequencing), symbols (e.g. arrow), and graphics (e.g. text boxes). In translated questionnaires, the design elements also take into account the writing practice (e.g. Spanish words are lengthier and require more space on the page or on the computer screen) and text orientation (e.g. Arabic is read from right to left) to prevent data missingness. 

Questionnaires can be administered by research staff, by volunteers or self-administered by the respondents. Clear, detailed instructions are needed in either case, matching the needs of each audience

=== Methods of collection ===

There are a number of channels, or modes, that can be used to administer a questionnaire. Each has strengths and weaknesses, and therefore a researcher will generally need to tailor their questionnaire to the modes they will be using. For example, a questionnaire designed to be filled-out on paper may not operate in the same way when administered by telephone. These mode effects may be substantial enough that they threaten the validity of the research.

Using multiple modes can improve access to the population of interest when some members have different access, or have particular preferences.

===Question wording===
The way that a question is phrased can have a large impact on how a research participant will answer the question. Thus, survey researchers must be conscious of their wording when writing survey questions. It is important for researchers to keep in mind that different individuals, cultures, and subcultures can interpret certain words and phrases differently from one another.

There are two different types of questions that survey researchers use when writing a questionnaire: free-response questions and closed questions. Free-response questions are open-ended, whereas closed questions are usually multiple-choice. Free-response questions are beneficial because they allow the responder greater flexibility, but they are also very difficult to record and score, requiring extensive coding. Contrastingly, closed questions can be scored and coded more easily, but they diminish expressivity and spontaneity of the responder. Some problems with the wording of questions are obvious and may be intentional, particularly in psuedopolls, whose sponsors are seeking specific results. Wording problems can arise on routine topics in legtimate surveyss If question wording can affect measurement of relatively objective matters, such as a person&#x27;s age, the number of children in a family, or the frequency of news watching, then how much might wording affect more subjective phenomena? 

In general, the vocabulary of a question should be very simple and direct, and preferably under twenty words. Each question should be edited for readability and should avoid leading or loaded questions. If multiple questions are being used to measure one construct, some of the questions should be worded in the opposite direction to evade response bias.

A respondent&#x27;s answer to an open-ended question can be coded into a response scale afterwards, or analysed using more qualitative methods. Two studies demonstrate both the importance of question wording and the differential impact it can have on different subsets of citizens. The first study examined how the use of the terms &quot;global warming&quot; versus &quot;climate change&quot; influenced Americans&#x27; opinions about the world&#x27;s changing environment. Another study also demonstrates the importance of question wording and how it affects subsets of respondents.

===Question sequence===

Questions should flow logically, from the general to the specific, from least to most sensitive, from factual and behavioral matters to attitudes and opinions. When semi-automated, they should flow from unaided to aided questions. The researcher should ensure that the answer to a question is not influenced by previous questions.

According to the three-stage theory (also called the sandwich theory), questions should be asked in three stages:
#screening and rapport questions
#product-specific questions
#demographic types of questions

<text>The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure, fluid, and electrolyte balance, and systemic vascular resistance.

When renal blood flow is reduced, juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys convert the precursor prorenin (already present in the blood) into renin and secrete it directly into the circulation. Plasma renin then carries out the conversion of angiotensinogen, released by the liver, to a decapeptide called angiotensin I, which has no biological function on its own. Angiotensin I is subsequently converted to the active angiotensin II (an octapeptide) by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) found on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, predominantly those of the lungs. Angiotensin II has a short life of about 1 to 2 minutes. Then, it is rapidly degraded into a heptapeptide called angiotensin III by angiotensinases which are present in red blood cells and vascular beds in many tissues.

Angiotensin III increases blood pressure and stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex; it has 100% adrenocortical stimulating activity and 40% vasopressor activity of angiotensin II.

Angiotensin IV also has adrenocortical and vasopressor activities.

Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictive peptide that causes blood vessels to narrow, resulting in increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the secretion of the hormone aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone causes the renal tubules to increase the reabsorption of sodium which in consequence causes the reabsorption of water into the blood, while at the same time causing the excretion of potassium (to maintain electrolyte balance). This increases the volume of extracellular fluid in the body, which also increases blood pressure.

If the RAS is abnormally active, blood pressure will be too high. There are several types of drugs which includes ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and renin inhibitors that interrupt different steps in this system to improve blood pressure. These drugs are one of the primary ways to control high blood pressure, heart failure, kidney failure, and harmful effects of diabetes.

==Activation==
The system can be activated when there is a loss of blood volume or a drop in blood pressure (such as in hemorrhage or dehydration). This loss of pressure is interpreted by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus. It can also be activated by a decrease in the filtrate sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration or a decreased filtrate flow rate that will stimulate the macula densa to signal the juxtaglomerular cells to release renin.

# If the perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney&#x27;s macula densa decreases, then the juxtaglomerular cells (granular cells, modified pericytes in the glomerular capillary) release the enzyme renin.
# Renin cleaves a decapeptide from angiotensinogen, a globular protein. The decapeptide is known as angiotensin I.
# Angiotensin I is then converted to an octapeptide, &quot;angiotensin II&quot; by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is thought to be found mainly in endothelial cells of the capillaries throughout the body, within the lungs and the epithelial cells of the kidneys. One study in 1992 found ACE in all blood vessel endothelial cells.
# Angiotensin II is the major bioactive product of the renin–angiotensin system, binding to receptors on intraglomerular mesangial cells, causing these cells to contract along with the blood vessels surrounding them; and to receptors on the zona glomerulosa cells, causing the release of aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex. Angiotensin II acts as an endocrine, autocrine/paracrine, and intracrine hormone.

==Cardiovascular effects==

Angiotensin I may have some minor activity, but angiotensin II is the major bio-active product. Angiotensin II has a variety of effects on the body:
* Throughout the body, angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor of arterioles.
* In the kidneys, angiotensin II constricts glomerular arterioles, having a greater effect on efferent arterioles than afferent. As with most other capillary beds in the body, the constriction of afferent arterioles increases the arteriolar resistance, raising systemic arterial blood pressure and decreasing the blood flow. However, the kidneys must continue to filter enough blood despite this drop in blood flow, necessitating mechanisms to keep glomerular blood pressure up. To do this, angiotensin II constricts efferent arterioles, which forces blood to build up in the glomerulus, increasing glomerular pressure. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is thus maintained, and blood filtration can continue despite lowered overall kidney blood flow. Because the filtration fraction, which is the ratio of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to the renal plasma flow (RPF), has increased, there is less plasma fluid in the downstream peritubular capillaries. This in turn leads to a decreased hydrostatic pressure and increased oncotic pressure (due to unfiltered plasma proteins) in the peritubular capillaries. The effect of decreased hydrostatic pressure and increased oncotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries will facilitate increased reabsorption of tubular fluid.
* Angiotensin II decreases medullary blood flow through the vasa recta. This decreases the washout of NaCl and urea in the kidney medullary space. Thus, higher concentrations of NaCl and urea in the medulla facilitate increased absorption of tubular fluid. Furthermore, increased reabsorption of fluid into the medulla will increase passive reabsorption of sodium along the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle.
* Angiotensin II stimulates / exchangers located on the apical membranes (faces the tubular lumen) of cells in the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in addition to channels in the collecting ducts. This will ultimately lead to increased sodium reabsorption.
* Angiotensin II stimulates the hypertrophy of renal tubule cells, leading to further sodium reabsorption.
* In the adrenal cortex, angiotensin II acts to cause the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone acts on the tubules (e.g., the distal convoluted tubules and the cortical collecting ducts) in the kidneys, causing them to reabsorb more sodium and water from the urine. This increases blood volume and, therefore, increases blood pressure. In exchange for the reabsorbing of sodium to blood, potassium is secreted into the tubules, becomes part of urine and is excreted.
* Angiotensin II causes the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin – ADH is made in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary gland. As its name suggests, it also exhibits vaso-constrictive properties, but its main course of action is to stimulate reabsorption of water in the kidneys. ADH also acts on the central nervous system to increase an individual&#x27;s appetite for salt, and to stimulate the sensation of thirst.

These effects directly act together to increase blood pressure and are opposed by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).

==Local renin–angiotensin systems==
Locally expressed renin–angiotensin systems have been found in a number of tissues, including the kidneys, adrenal glands, the heart, vasculature and nervous system, and have a variety of functions, including local cardiovascular regulation, in association or independently of the systemic renin–angiotensin system, as well as non-cardiovascular functions. Outside the kidneys, renin is predominantly picked up from the circulation but may be secreted locally in some tissues; its precursor prorenin is highly expressed in tissues and more than half of circulating prorenin is of extrarenal origin, but its physiological role besides serving as precursor to renin is still unclear. Outside the liver, angiotensinogen is picked up from the circulation or expressed locally in some tissues; with renin they form angiotensin I, and locally expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme, chymase or other enzymes can transform it into angiotensin II. This process can be intracellular or interstitial.

In the adrenal glands, it is likely involved in the paracrine regulation of aldosterone secretion; in the heart and vasculature, it may be involved in remodeling or vascular tone; and in the brain, where it is largely independent of the circulatory RAS, it may be involved in local blood pressure regulation. In addition, both the central and peripheral nervous systems can use angiotensin for sympathetic neurotransmission. Other places of expression include the reproductive system, the skin and digestive organs. Medications aimed at the systemic system may affect the expression of those local systems, beneficially or adversely.

==Fetal renin–angiotensin system==
In the fetus, the renin–angiotensin system is predominantly a sodium-losing system, as angiotensin II has little or no effect on aldosterone levels. Renin levels are high in the fetus, while angiotensin II levels are significantly lower; this is due to the limited pulmonary blood flow, preventing ACE (found predominantly in the pulmonary circulation) from having its maximum effect.

==Clinical significance==
* ACE inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are often used to reduce the formation of the more potent angiotensin II. Captopril is an example of an ACE inhibitor. ACE cleaves a number of other peptides, and in this capacity is an important regulator of the kinin–kallikrein system, as such blocking ACE can lead to side effects.
* Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers, can be used to prevent angiotensin II from acting on its receptors.
* Direct renin inhibitors can also be used for hypertension. The drugs that inhibit renin are aliskiren and the investigational remikiren.
* Vaccines against angiotensin II, for example CYT006-AngQb, have been investigated.

* Bainbridge reflex: In response to stretching of the right atrium wall, heart rate increases, lowering venous blood pressure.
* Baroreflex: When the stretch receptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus increase, the blood pressure is considered to be elevated and the heart rate decreases to lower blood pressure.
* Antidiuretic hormone: The hypothalamus detects the extracellular fluid hyperosmolality and the posterior pituitary gland secretes antidiuretic hormone to increase water reabsorption in the collecting duct.

<text>The American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), also known as a Mississippi paddlefish, spoon-billed cat, or spoonbill, is a species of ray-finned fish. It is the last living species of paddlefish (Polyodontidae). This family is most closely related to the sturgeons; together they make up the order Acipenseriformes, which are one of the most primitive living groups of ray-finned fish. Fossil records of other paddlefish species date back 125 million years to the Early Cretaceous, with records of &quot;Polyodon&quot; extending back 65 million years to the early Paleocene. The American paddlefish is a smooth-skinned freshwater fish with an almost entirely cartilaginous skeleton and a paddle-shaped rostrum (snout), which extends nearly one-third its body length. It has been referred to as a freshwater shark because of its heterocercal tail or caudal fin resembling that of sharks, though it is not closely related. The American paddlefish is a highly derived fish because it has evolved specialised adaptations such as filter feeding. Its rostrum and cranium are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton, its primary food source. The only other species of paddlefish that survived to modern times was the Chinese paddlefish (&quot;Psephurus gladius&quot;), last sighted in 2003 in the Yangtze River in China and considered to have gone extinct no later than 2010.

The American paddlefish is native to the Mississippi River basin and once moved freely under the relatively unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s. It commonly inhabited large, free-flowing rivers, braided channels, backwaters, and oxbow lakes throughout the Mississippi River drainage basin, and adjacent Gulf Coast drainages. Its peripheral range extended into the Great Lakes, with occurrences in Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada until about 1917. American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Poaching has also been a contributing factor to its decline and is liable to continue to be so as long as the demand for caviar remains strong. Naturally occurring American paddlefish populations have been extirpated from most of their peripheral range, as well as from New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. They have been reintroduced in the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio river systems in western Pennsylvania. However, their current range has been reduced to the Mississippi and Missouri River tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin. American paddlefish are currently found in twenty-two states in the U.S., and are protected under state, federal and international laws.

==Taxonomy, etymology and evolution==
In 1797, French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède established the genus &quot;Polyodon&quot; for paddlefish, which today includes a single extant species, &quot;Polyodon spathula&quot;. Lacépède disagreed with Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre&#x27;s description in (1788), which had suggested that paddlefish were a species of shark. When Lacépède established his binomial name &quot;Polydon feuille&quot; he was unaware the species had already been described in 1792 by taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum, who had named it as &quot;Squalus spathula&quot;. Consequently &quot;spathula&quot; has priority as the specific name (and &#x27;Walbaum, 1792&#x27; is the taxonomic authority to be cited). But Walbaum&#x27;s generic name &quot;Squalus&quot; was already in use for dogfish, so Lacépède&#x27;s &quot;Polyodon&quot; is the valid name for this paddlefish genus. Hence &quot;&#x27;Polyodon spathula&quot; (Walbaum, 1792)&#x27; is the accepted full scientific name of the American paddlefish.

The American paddlefish is the sole surviving species in the paddlefish family, the Polyodontidae. This is the sister group to the sturgeons (family Acipenseridae); evidence from DNA sequences suggest that their last common ancestor lived roughly 140 million years ago. Together these families compose the Acipenseriformes, an order of basal ray-finned fishes. Paddlefish have a long fossil record dating back to the Early Cretaceous 125 million years ago. American paddlefish are often referred to as primitive fish, or relict species, because of morphological characteristics that they retain from some of their early fossil ancestors. These characteristics include a skeleton composed primarily of cartilage, and a deeply forked heterocercal (spine extending into the upper lobe) caudal fin similar to that of sharks, although they are not closely related.

The family Polyodontidae comprises six known species: three fossil species from western North America, one fossil species from China, one recently extinct species from China (the Chinese paddlefish, &quot;Psephurus gladius&quot;; last recorded 2003), and the single extant species, the American paddlefish, native to the Mississippi River Basin in the United States. DNA sequences suggest the Chinese and American paddlefishes diverged about 68 million years ago. The oldest fossils of paddlefish belonging to &quot;Polyodon&quot; are those of &quot;P. tuberculata&quot; from the Lower Paleocene Tullock Member of the Fort Union Formation in Montana, dating to around 65 million years ago. An elongated rostrum is a morphological characteristic of Polyodontidae, but only the genus &quot;Polyodon&quot; has characteristics adapted specifically for filter feeding, including the jaw, gill arches, and cranium. The gill rakers of American paddlefish are composed of extensive comb-like filaments believed to have inspired the etymology of the genus name, &quot;Polyodon&quot;, a Greek compound word meaning &quot;many toothed&quot;. Adult American paddlefish are actually toothless, although numerous small teeth less than were found in a juvenile paddlefish measuring . The name &quot;spathula&quot; references the elongated, paddle-shaped snout or rostrum. Compared to Chinese paddlefish and fossil genera, American paddlefish (and the fossil relative &quot;P. tuberculata&quot;) are considered to be highly derived because of their specialised adaptations.

Unlike the planktivorous American paddlefish, Chinese paddlefish were strong swimmers, grew larger, and were opportunistic piscivores that fed on small fishes and crustaceans. Some distinct morphological differences of Chinese paddlefish include a narrower, sword-like rostrum, and a protrusible mouth. They also had fewer, thicker gill rakers than American paddlefish.

==Description==

American paddlefish are among the largest and longest-lived freshwater fishes in North America. They have a shark-like body, average in length, weigh , and can live in excess of thirty years. For most populations the median age is five to eight years and the maximum age is fourteen to eighteen years. The age of American paddlefish is best determined by dentary studies, a process which usually occurs on fish harvested during snagging season, a popular sport fishing activity in certain parts of the U.S. The dentary is removed from the lower jawbone, cleaned of any remaining soft tissue, and cross-sectioned to expose the annual rings. The dentary rings are counted in much the same way a tree is aged. Dentary studies suggest that some individuals can live 60 years or longer, and that females typically live longer and grow larger than males.

American paddlefish are smooth-skinned and almost entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes are small and directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During the initial stages of development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fish. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.

Scientists began to debate the function of the American paddlefish&#x27;s rostrum when the species was described in the late 1700s. They had once believed it was used to excavate bottom substrate or functioned as a balancing mechanism and navigational aid. However, laboratory experiments in 1993 that utilized advanced technology in the field of electron microscopy have established conclusively that the rostrum of American paddlefish is covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors. These receptors are morphologically similar to the ampullae of Lorenzini of sharks and rays, and are indeed passive ampullary-type electroreceptors used by American paddlefish to detect plankton. Clusters of electroreceptors also cover the head and operculum flaps. The diet of the American paddlefish consists primarily of zooplankton. Examples of animals in the &quot;P. spathula&quot; diet are copepods, cladocerans such as &quot;Daphnia pulex&quot;, and ephemeropteran nymphs. Their electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields that signal not only the presence of zooplankton, but also the individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton appendages. When a swarm of zooplankton is detected, the paddlefish swims forward continuously with its mouth wide open, forcing water over the gill rakers to filter out prey. Such feeding behavior is considered ram suspension-feeding. Further research has indicated that the electroreceptor of the paddlefish may serve as a navigational aid for obstacle avoidance.

American paddlefish have small undeveloped eyes that are directed laterally. Unlike most fishes, American paddlefish hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination. Electroreception appears to have largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality, which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey. However, the rostrum is not their only means of food detection. Some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render American paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health, but laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise. As well as electroreceptors on the rostrum, American paddlefish have sensory pores covering nearly half of the skin surface extending from the rostrum to the top of the head down to the tips of the operculum flaps. Studies have indicated that American paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health.

==Reproduction and life cycle==

American paddlefish are long-lived, sexually late maturing pelagic fish. Females do not begin spawning until they are seven to ten years old, some as late as sixteen to eighteen years old. Females do not spawn every year; rather they spawn every second or third year. Males spawn more frequently, usually every year or every other year beginning around age seven, some as late as nine or ten years of age.

American paddlefish begin their upstream spawning migration sometime during early spring; some begin in late fall. They spawn on silt-free gravel bars that would otherwise be exposed to air or covered by very shallow water were it not for the rises in the river from snow melt and annual spring rains that cause flooding. Although availability of preferred spawning habitat is essential, there are three precise environmental events that must occur before American paddlefish will spawn. The water temperature must be from ; the lengthened photoperiod which occurs in spring triggers biological and behavioral processes that are dependent on increasing day length; and there must be a proper rise and flow in the river before a successful spawn can occur. Historically, American paddlefish did not spawn every year because the precise environmental events occurred just once every 4 or 5 years.

American paddlefish are broadcast spawners, also referred to as mass spawners or synchronous spawners. Gravid females release their eggs into the water over bare rocks or gravel at the same time males release their sperm. Fertilization occurs externally. The eggs become sticky after they are released into the water and will attach to the bottom substrate. Incubation varies depending on water temperature, but in water the eggs will hatch into larval fish in about seven days. After hatching, the larval fish drift downstream into areas of low flow velocity where they forage on zooplankton.

Young American paddlefish are poor swimmers which makes them susceptible to predation. Therefore, rapid first-year growth is important to their survival. Fry can grow about per week, and by late July the fingerlings are around long. Their rate of growth is variable and highly dependent on food abundance. Higher growth rates occur in areas where food is not limited. The feeding behavior of fingerlings is quite different from that of older juveniles and adults. They capture individual plankton one by one, which requires detection and location of individual &quot;Daphnia&quot; on approach, followed by an intercept maneuver to capture the selected prey. By late September fingerlings have developed into juveniles, and are around long. After the 1st year their growth rate slows and is highly variable. Studies indicate that by age 5 their growth rate averages around per year depending on the abundance of food and other environmental influences.

==Habitat and distribution==
American paddlefish are highly mobile and well adapted to living in rivers. They inhabit many types of riverine habitats throughout much of the Mississippi Valley and adjacent Gulf slope drainages. They occur most frequently in deeper, low current areas such as side channels, oxbows, backwater lakes, bayous, and tailwaters below dams. They have been observed to move more than in a river system.

American paddlefish are endemic to the Mississippi River Basin, historically occurring from the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers in the northwest to the Ohio and Allegheny rivers of the northeast; the headwaters of the Mississippi River south to its mouth, from the San Jacinto River in the southwest to the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers of the southeast. They were extirpated from New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as from much of their peripheral range in the Great Lakes region, including Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada. In 1991, Pennsylvania implemented a reintroduction program utilizing hatchery-reared American paddlefish in an effort to establish self-sustaining populations in the upper Ohio and lower Allegheny rivers. In 1998, New York initiated a stocking program upstream in the Allegheny Reservoir above Kinzua Dam, and a second stocking in 2006 in Conewango Creek, a relatively unaltered section of their historic range. Reports of free ranging adults captured by gill nets have since been documented in Pennsylvania and New York, but there is no evidence of natural reproduction. They are currently found in 22 states in the US, and are protected under state and federal laws. There are 13 states that allow commercial or sport fishing for American paddlefish.

==Human interaction==

===Propagation and culture===
The artificial propagation of American paddlefish began with the efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery. However, it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States. Artificial propagation requires broodstock which, because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish, are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment. The fish are injected with LH-RH hormone to stimulate spawning. The number of eggs a female may produce depends on the size of the fish and can range anywhere from 70,000 to 300,000 eggs. Unlike most teleosts, the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity. To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed. The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes. The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus. The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity.

Once maturation is confirmed, one of three procedures is used to extract the eggs from a female paddlefish. The three procedures are:

# the traditional hand-stripping method, considered to be time-consuming and laborious;
# Caesarean section, a relatively quick surgical method of extracting eggs through a abdominal incision which, though considered faster than hand stripping, can involve time-consuming suturing and an incision resulting in muscular stress and poor suture retention which lowers survival rate; and;
# MIST (minimally invasive surgical technique), which is the fastest of the three procedures because it requires less handling of the fish and eliminates the need for suturing. A small internal incision is made in the dorsal area of the oviduct, which allows direct stripping of eggs from the body cavity through the gonopore bypassing the oviductal funnels.

A spermiating male indicates successful production of mature spermatozoa which results in the release of large volumes of milt over the course of three to four days. Milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into the urogenital opening of the male and applying light suction with the syringe to draw the milt. The collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to the eggs and the combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization. Fertilized eggs are adhesive and demersal, therefore if incubation is to take place in a flow-through hatching jar, the eggs must be treated to prevent clumping. Incubation usually takes anywhere from five to twelve days.

===Hybridization===
A 2020 paper reported that eggs from three Russian sturgeons were crossbred with American paddlefish using sperm from four male paddlefish, resulting in hybrids called sturddlefish, a blend of the two names. The offspring had a survival rate of 62–74% and on average reached after a year of growth. This was the first time such fish from different families were successfully crossbred. Their last common ancestor is estimated to have lived 140 million years ago.

===Global commercial market===

Advancements in biotechnology have created a global commercial market for the polyculture of American paddlefish. In 1970, American paddlefish were stocked in several rivers in Europe and Asia. Introduction began when five thousand hatched larvae from Missouri hatcheries in the United States were exported to the former Soviet Union for aquacultural utilization. Reproduction was successful in 1988 and 1989, and resulted in the exportation of juveniles to Romania and Hungary. American paddlefish are now being raised in Ukraine, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and the Plovdiv and Vidin regions in Bulgaria. In May 2006, specimens of different sizes and weights were caught by professional fisherman near Prahovo in the Serbian part of the Danube River.

In 1988, fertilized American paddlefish eggs and larvae from Missouri hatcheries were first introduced into China. Since that time, China imports approximately 4.5million fertilized eggs and larvae every year from hatcheries in Russia and the United States. Some American paddlefish are polycultured in carp ponds and sold to restaurants while others are cultured for brood stock and caviar production. China has also exported American paddlefish to Cuba, where they are farmed for caviar production.

===Sport fishing===
American paddlefish are a popular sport fish where their populations are sufficient to allow such activity. Areas where there are no self-sustaining populations rely on state and federal restocking programs to maintain a viable fishery. A 2009 report includes the following states as allowing American paddlefish sport fishing per their respective state and federal regulations: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee. Since American paddlefish are filter-feeders, they will not take bait or lures, and must be caught by snagging.

The official state record in Kansas is an American paddlefish snagged in 2004 that weighed . In Montana, an American paddlefish was snagged in 1973 weighing . In North Dakota, one snagged in 2024 weighed . The largest American paddlefish on record was captured in West Okoboji Lake, Iowa, in 1916 by a spear fisherman; it measured and weighed an estimated .

==Population declines==
===Overfishing and habitat destruction===
American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of overfishing and habitat destruction. In 2004 they were listed as Vulnerable (VU A3de ver 3.1) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In 2022 the status category was changed to VU A2cd throughout their range as the result of a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service assessment. The assessment concluded that &quot;an overall population size reduction of at least 30% may occur within the next 10 years or three generations due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and the effects of introduced taxa, pollutants, competitors or parasites.&quot; American paddlefish are filter-feeding pelagic fish that require large, free-flowing rivers with braided channels, backwater areas, oxbow lakes that are rich in zooplankton, and gravel bars for spawning. Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the Missouri River have impounded large populations of American paddlefish, and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals. Channelization and groynes or wing dykes have caused the narrowing of rivers and altered flow, destroying crucial spawning and nursery habitat. As a result, most impounded populations are not self-sustaining and must be stocked to maintain a viable sport fishery.

===Zebra mussels===
Zebra mussel infestations in the Mississippi River, Great Lakes and other Midwest rivers are also negatively affecting American paddlefish populations. Zebra mussels are an invasive species well adapted for explosive population growth as a result of high rates of fecundity and recruitment. As filter feeders, zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton from the water, altering the availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native unionidae. A few days after the fertilization of zebra mussel eggs, a microscopic larva emerges called a veliger. During this initial stage of development, which usually lasts a few weeks, veligers are able to swim freely in the water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton. Veligers are poor swimmers, making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton. However, natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to the long-term reduction of zebra mussel populations.

===Poaching and overexploitation===
Poaching has been a contributing factor to declining populations of American paddlefish in the states where they are commercially exploited, particularly while the demand for caviar remains strong. Since the 1980s, a trade embargo on Iran restricted imports of the highly sought after and most expensive beluga caviar from the Caspian Sea, limiting U.S. sources of caviar. The most sought-after caviar is produced by sturgeons in the Northern Caspian Sea, but overfishing and poaching have exhausted the supply. American sturgeon and paddlefish populations were targeted as likely substitutes.

The roe of American paddlefish can be processed into caviar similar in taste, color, size and texture to sevruga sturgeon caviar from the Caspian Sea. Several cases of mislabeled American paddlefish roe sold as Caspian Sea caviar have been prosecuted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. State and federal regulations restricting the harvest of American paddlefish populations in the wild, and the illegal trafficking of their roe, are strictly enforced. Related violations such as the illegal transport of American paddlefish roe have resulted in convictions with substantial fines and prison sentences. American paddlefish are also protected under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade in the species (including parts and derivatives) is regulated.

===Extinction of Chinese paddlefish===
The primary reasons for the decline of the now-extinct Chinese paddlefish are similar to those of American paddlefish, which include overfishing, the construction of dams, and destruction of habitat. The last confirmed sighting of a live Chinese paddlefish was from the Yangtze River on January 24, 2003. From 2006 to 2008, scientists conducted surveys in an effort to locate the fish. They used several boats, deployed 4,762 setlines, 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets covering on the upper Yangtze River, most of which lies within the protected area of the Upper Yangtze National Nature Reserve. They did not catch a single fish. They also used hydroacoustic equipment to monitor sounds in the water, but were unable to confirm the presence of paddlefish. The species is believed to have gone extinct before 2005 and no later than 2010. The IUCN assessed the species as extinct in 2019, formally publishing this categorisation in 2022.

<text>foobar2000 (often abbreviated as fb2k or f2k) is a freeware audio player for Microsoft Windows, iOS, Android, macOS, and formerly Windows Phone, developed by Peter Pawłowski. It has a modular design, which provides user flexibility in configuration and customization. Standard &quot;skin&quot; elements can be individually augmented or replaced with different dials and buttons, as well as visualizers such as waveform, oscilloscope, spectrum, spectrogram (waterfall), peak and smoothed VU meters, which all of them are analysis-oriented, at least for built-in visualizations. foobar2000 offers third-party user interface modifications through a software development kit (SDK).

foobar2000 supports many audio file formats, has many features for organizing metadata, files, and folders, and has a converter interface for use with command line encoders. To maximize audio fidelity in cases where resampling or downscaling in bit depth is required, it provides noise shaping and dithering. There are a number of official and third-party components which add many additional features. The core is closed source, whereas the SDK is licensed under the Three-Clause BSD license.

==History and development==
foobar2000 was first released on 20 December 2002 and developed by Peter Pawłowski, who had previously worked at Nullsoft and developed plugins for Winamp. He created foobar2000 with the audiophile community in mind. The software&#x27;s mascot and logo icon consists of a white &quot;alien cat&quot;.

foobar2000 supports Windows, though the support of older versions for Windows XP and Vista has been dropped as of version 1.6 (released 2020). Windows 2000 support was dropped as of version 0.9.5 (released 2008) and Windows 95/98/ME/NT4 support was dropped as of version 0.9 (released 2006).

Most functionality also works as intended under Wine on Linux, although the program&#x27;s crash reporter will detect Wine and direct the user to the Wine Bugzilla. The vast majority of plugins and themes work fine, however, certain plugins may cause issues. Safe mode allows users to disable all plugins temporarily to debug the issue.

foobar2000 versions since 0.9.5 feature a revamped default interface, with embedded support for album list, album art, spectrum visualization, and some other features and improvements. 

In May 2016, versions for mobile devices were released, and in January 2018, an early beta version for macOS was released. In April 2023, version 2.0 was released out of beta with native support for 64-bit, dark mode, and ARM.

== Features ==

=== Core ===
At its core, foobar2000 natively supports a range of audio formats, including MP1, MP2, MP3, MPC, AAC, WMA, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC / Ogg FLAC, ALAC, WavPack, WAV, AIFF, AU, SND, Audio CD, Speex, and Opus.

foobar2000 also has a highly customizable user interface, advanced tagging capabilities and support for ripping Audio CDs, as well as transcoding of all supported audio formats using the Converter component. The player can read inside ZIP, GZIP, and RAR archives.

Additional features include ReplayGain support (for both playback and calculation), gapless playback, keyboard shortcuts and support for DSP effects such as equalization and crossfade.

Users can configure the foobar2000 Media Library with automated folder watching and Windows Media streaming. The client is built with an open component architecture, allowing third-party developers to extend functionality of the player.
=== Optional ===
With addons or plugins, foobar2000 can read the APE, HDCD, AC3, DTS, SACD and DVD-Audio formats.

Other optional features include playback statistics, CD burning, kernel streaming, ASIO support, WASAPI output compatibility, and a UPnP/DLNA renderer, media server and controller for networking. Third-party support is also present in the audio client. For instance, foobar2000 supports Last.fm scrobbling and integration with Apple iPod, including album art support and automatic transcoding of audio formats not supported by iPod itself.

==Derivative works==
foobar2000 developer Peter Pawłowski has also made other audio software, including Boom, which his web site describes as an &quot;easy to use audio player intended for casual computer users&quot;. It runs on Windows.

<doc id="269950" wikidata="Q477223" url="?curid=269950" title="Chinese paddlefish">
<text>The Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius; : literal translation: &quot;white sturgeon&quot;), also known as the Chinese swordfish, is an extinct species of fish that was formerly native to the Yangtze and Yellow River basins in China. With records of specimens over and possibly in length, it was one of the largest species of freshwater fish. It was the only species in the genus Psephurus and one of two recent species of paddlefish (Polyodontidae), the other being the American paddlefish (&quot;Polyodon spathula&quot;). It was an anadromous species, meaning that it spent part of its adult life at sea, while migrating upriver to spawn.

The Chinese paddlefish was officially declared extinct in 2022, with an estimated time of extinction to be by 2005, and no later than 2010, although it had become functionally extinct by 1993. The main cause of its extinction was the construction of the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams, causing population fragmentation and blocking the anadromous spawning migration. Overfishing also played a significant role in its demise. Fishing of the Chinese paddlefish dates back centuries, with annual harvests reaching 25 tons by the 1970s. Since the 1990s, the species was officially listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as critically endangered, and was last seen alive in 2003. A 2019 paper including scientists from the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute found the species to be extinct. It was unanimously agreed to be extinct by the Species Survival Commission Sturgeon Specialist Group of the IUCN on 15 September 2019, with its conservation status being formally updated by the IUCN Red List in July 2022.

==Description==
The Chinese paddlefish had a white underbelly, and its back and head were grey. Its dorsal and anal fins were situated considerably far back on the body. The paddle-like rostrum was narrow and pointed, and was between a quarter and up to a third of total body length. Its eyes were small and round. The tail fin was heterocercal (spine extending into the upper lobe), with the lower lobe being well developed. The skull is more elongate and narrower than that of the American paddlefish, and lacks the sculpturing present on the skull bones of other paddlefish, with the stellate (star-shaped) bones on the rostrum less numerous than those of the American paddlefish. The teeth were small, sharp, canine shaped and inward curling, and became proportionally smaller relative to the jaw during growth, and in mature adults were completely fused into the bone. Compared to &quot;Polyodon&quot;, the jaws were shorter, and had a proportionately narrower gape, and unlike the American paddlefish, but similar to fossil paddlefish, the upper jaw was not firmly attached to the braincase. Like other paddlefish, the skeleton was largely cartilaginous. The body lacked scales, except for small scales in the caudal peduncle and caudal fin.

Juveniles attained a weight of around by their first winter and a length of and a weight of about by the time they were a year old. Beyond this length, proportional weight gain relative to body length dramatically increased, reaching a weight of about by the time they were around long. They reached sexual maturity at a weight of around . The maximum length of the Chinese paddlefish is often quoted as , with this estimate apparently being given by C. Ping (1931), though according to Grande and Bemis (1991), specimens over had not been definitively measured. Ping recorded that fishermen in Nanjing caught a Chinese paddlefish with a length of and a weight of . FishBase and World Wide Fund for Nature gives a conservative maximum weight of . Female fish are suggested to have grown larger than male fish once sexually mature, though they grew at similar rates prior to this. The lifespan has been estimated at 29–38 years, though the theoretical maximum lifespan is likely to have been significantly higher, as the estimate reflects anthropogenic impacts on the population.

== Taxonomy and evolutionary history ==

The species was first named as a species of &quot;Polyodon&quot; by Eduard von Martens in 1862. It was placed into a separate, monotypic genus by Albert Günther in 1873. The species was also given a different name, &quot;Spatularia angustifolium&quot; by Johann Jakob Kaup also in 1862, but this is considered a junior synonym of &quot;P. gladius.&quot;

Paddlefish (Polyodontidae) are one of two living families of Acipenseriformes alongside sturgeons (Acipenseridae). The oldest records of Acipenseriformes date to the Early Jurassic, over 190 million years ago. The oldest paddlefish fossil is that of &quot;Protopsephurus&quot; from the Early Cretaceous of China, dating to around 120 million years ago. The oldest representatives of the genus containing the American paddlefish (&quot;Polyodon&quot;) date to around 65 million years ago, from the beginning of the Paleocene. Various molecular clock estimates have been given for the age of the divergence between the American and Chinese paddlefish, including 68 million years ago 72 million years ago, and 100 million years ago, all dating to the middle to Upper Cretaceous.

==Distribution, habitat and ecology==
The Chinese paddlefish was native to the Yangtze (Chang Jiang) River basin and its estuary at the East China Sea. Historically it was also recorded in the Yellow River basin (which is connected to the Yangtze by the Grand Canal) and its estuary at the Yellow Sea. It primarily inhabited the large rivers, but sometimes travelled into large lakes. Due to their anadromous nature, mature individuals were found in coastal waters of the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea; occasionally spring tides would bring individuals into the lower reaches of the Qiantang and Yong rivers of Zhejiang province.

The species spent part of its life in the lower section of the Yangtze, including the brackish water of its estuary, but migrated upriver and into major tributaries to congregate for spawning, which occurred in spring, from mid-March to early April. One spawning site on the Jinsha River, located at the midpoint of the river, around from the riverbank, was around in length, and had a max water depth of and rapid water flow, with the bottom sediments in the lower reaches being shingly and in the upper reaches muddy/sandy. A study on a sample of spawning Chinese paddlefish found that they were all at least 8 years old. Females likely sexually matured later than males, and probably did not spawn every year, likely every other year or somewhat less frequently, like other acipenseriforms. The ovaries of the female fish contained over 100,000 eggs, each approximately across. The developing zygotes and fry were restricted to the region of the Yangtze basin upstream of Luzhou in southeastern Sichuan, while yearlings and adults were widely distributed throughout the Yangtze river proper from the lower to upper reaches.

The fish was largely solitary, and occupied the lower-mid layers of the water column. Chinese paddlefish were noted for being strong swimmers. Unlike its relative the American paddlefish, which is a planktivorous filter feeder, the Chinese paddlefish was primarily piscivorous, mainly feeding on small to medium-sized fishes like anchovies (&quot;Coilia)&quot;, cyprinids (&quot;Coreius, Rhinogobio&quot;)&quot;,&quot; gobies (&quot;Gobius)&quot; as well as bagrid catfish and bothid flounders. Shrimp and crab were also eaten. The jaws, unlike the American paddlefish but like sturgeons and fossil paddlefish, were capable of protrusion, a form of cranial kinesis allowing them to move relative to the rest of the skull, with the upper jaw being able to thrust downwards and forwards in order to seize prey. Paddlefish, like other Acipenseriformes and several other groups of vertebrates, engage in passive electroreception (the sensing of external electric fields) using structures called ampullae that form an extension of the lateral line system of sensory organs. Passive electroreception (where electric fields are sensed but not generated, as in electric fish) is primarily used for detecting the weak electric fields generated by prey. The head and rostrum of Chinese paddlefish, like those of other paddlefish, was densely packed with ampullae, indicating that enhancing electroreception was one of the rostrum&#x27;s primary functions.

==Decline and extinction==
The last records of Chinese paddlefish in the Yellow River basin and its estuary date back to the 1960s, although declines were realized between the 13th and 19th centuries. Declines were significant throughout its primary range in the Yangtze basin, but annual captures of 25 tonnes continued into the 1970s. In 1983, the Chinese government made fishing of the species illegal due to its decline in numbers. The species was still being found in small numbers in the 1980s (for example, 32 were caught in 1985), and young were seen as recently as 1995. Due to the rarity of the fish by the time it was realised that it was in peril, and the fact that the adult fish were difficult to keep in captivity, attempts to create a captive breeding stock failed.

Since 2000, there have been only two confirmed sightings of the fish alive, both from the Yangtze basin: The first was a , female caught at Nanjing in 2002 and the second a , female accidentally caught at Yibin, Sichuan, on January 24, 2003, by fisherman Liu Longhua (刘龙华); the former died despite attempts to save it and the latter was radio-tagged and released, but the tag stopped working after only 12 hours.

During a search conducted in the Yangtze basin from 2006 to 2008, a research team from the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Science in Jingzhou failed to catch any paddlefish, but two possible specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals. A comprehensive study published in 2019, including scientists from the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute, found that the species was certainly extinct, based on its absence from extensive capture surveys of the Yangtze between 2017 and 2018. The paper estimated that the species went extinct between 2005 and 2010, but became functionally extinct by 1993. The primary cause of its extinction was overfishing and the construction of dams along the Yangtze. The paddlefish was heavily overfished in all stages of growth from fry (which were easily captured by traditional fishing methods) to adult, which combined with the long generation time due to its slow maturation led to reduced sustainability of viable populations. Dam construction, notably the Gezhouba Dam, which became operational in 1981, and the Three Gorges Dam landlocked and divided populations and prevented the spawning migration. The paper thus recommended the reclassification of the species as Extinct by the IUCN. A similar recommendation was also made by the Species Survival Commission Sturgeon Specialist Group of the IUCN in September 2019.

The official IUCN status of the species was formally updated to &quot;extinct&quot; in July 2022.

<text>David Michael Farrell (born February 8, 1977), also known by his stage name Phoenix, is an American musician, best known as the bassist of the rock band Linkin Park. He was also a member of Tasty Snax, a ska punk band.

== Early life ==
Farrell was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts but later moved to Mission Viejo, California at the age of five. He was taught how to play guitar by his mother when he was in high school. He also played the violin in high school. Farrell attended UCLA, where he was roommates with future bandmate Brad Delson. He graduated from UCLA with a degree in philosophy.

== Career ==
=== Tasty Snax ===
While attending high school, Farrell joined a Christian ska punk band named Tasty Snax, who would later rename themselves to The Snax. Phoenix transitioned from the electric guitar to bass to accommodate The Snax. The band included Farrell&#x27;s longtime college friend Mark Fiore, who was also associated in making various video albums for Linkin Park. The band recorded two studio albums and one compilation album, signed to Screaming Giant Records. Farrell left the band in 2000.

=== Linkin Park ===

Farrell joined Xero, the earliest incarnation of Linkin Park, after meeting Delson at UCLA. He contributed to the band&#x27;s self-titled demo tape in 1997, but left the project to tour with Tasty Snax. Farrell&#x27;s void was temporally filled by Delson, Ian Hornbeck and Scott Koziol, who all contributed to &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, Linkin Park&#x27;s debut album. Farrell returned to Linkin Park in 2000 after a year-long absence. He served as the band&#x27;s bassist for six of the band&#x27;s seven studio albums. On the 2002 &quot;Reanimation&quot; song &quot;Krwlng&quot;, the remixed version of &quot;Crawling&quot;, Farrell played the violin and cello parts. Along with Delson and Rob Bourdon, he also helped manage the band&#x27;s business operations.

Linkin Park went on a hiatus after Chester Bennington died in 2017; Farrell chose not to speak at Bennington&#x27;s memorial service because he said he was unable to fully express his feelings with words. He and Linkin Park returned after a seven-year hiatus to announce a new album, &quot;From Zero&quot;, and tour in 2024.

== Personal life ==
In 2008, Farrell stated that his political stances are &quot;all over the place&quot;, agreeing with &quot;certain Democratic views&quot; and &quot;a lot of other Republican views&quot;. Farrell is an avid golfer. He is also an association football fan and supports LA Galaxy, having previously been a season ticket holder. He has a podcast with his best friend and professional golfer, Brendan Steele, and Mark Fiore, Linkin Park&#x27;s videographer and video editor.

<text>Hamza Yusuf (born Mark Hanson; 1958) is an American Islamic scholar, neo-traditionalist, and co-founder of Zaytuna College. He is a proponent of classical learning in Islam and has promoted Islamic sciences and classical teaching methodologies throughout the world.

He is an advisor to both the Center for Islamic Studies at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley and the Islamic Studies programme at Stanford University. In addition, he serves as vice-president for the Global Center for Guidance and Renewal, which was founded and is currently presided over by Abdallah bin Bayyah. He also serves as vice-president of the United Arab Emirates-based Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies, where bin Bayyah also serves as president. The Forum has attracted huge controversy for its close ties to the UAE government, Yusuf&#x27;s personal support for authoritarian leaders since the Arab Spring, and Yusuf&#x27;s support for the Abraham Accords between Israel and the UAE. 

Yusuf has been listed in the top 50 of &quot;The 500 Most Influential Muslims&quot; publication. His detractors, however, have widely criticised him for his stance on race, politics, the Syrian revolution, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

==Early life and education==
Yusuf was born as Mark Hanson in Walla Walla, Washington to two academics working at Whitman College, and was raised in northern California. He grew up as a practicing Irish Catholic Christian and attended prep schools on both the East and West coasts. In 1977, after a near-death experience in a car accident and reading the Qur&#x27;an, he converted to Islam. Yusuf has Irish, Scottish and Greek ancestry.

After being impressed by a young couple from Saudi Arabia who were followers of Abdalqadir as-Sufi—a Scottish convert to Islam and leader of the Darqawa Sufi order and the Murabitun World Movement—Yusuf moved to Norwich, England to study directly under as-Sufi. In 1979, Yusuf moved to Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates where he spent the next four years studying Sharia sciences at the Islamic Studies Institute of the United Arab Emirates University, more often on a one-on-one basis with Islamic scholars. Yusuf became fluent in the Arabic language and also learned Qur&#x27;anic recitation (&quot;tajwid&quot;), rhetoric, poetry, law (&quot;fiqha&quot;) and theology (&quot;aqidah&quot;) among other classical Islamic disciplines.

In 1984, Yusuf formally disassociated himself from as-Sufi&#x27;s teachings and moved in a different intellectual direction, having been influenced by a number of Mauritanian scholars residing in the Emirates. He moved to North Africa in 1984 and studied in Algeria and Morocco, as well as Spain and Mauritania. In Mauritania he developed his most lasting and powerful relationship with Islamic scholar Sidi Muhammad Ould Fahfu al-Massumi, known as Murabit al-Hajj.

In 2020, Yusuf completed his Ph.D. at the Graduate Theological Union. His dissertation was titled, &quot;The Normative Islamic Tradition in North and West Africa: A Case Study of Transmission of Authority and Distillation of Knowledge in Ibn Ashir’s Al-Murshid al-Mu’in (The Helpful Guide).&quot; Yusuf previously earned an associate degree in nursing from Imperial Valley College and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in religious studies from San José State University.
== Scholarly career ==
===Zaytuna College===
He and other colleagues founded the Zaytuna Institute in Berkeley, California, United States, in 1996, dedicated to the revival of traditional study methods and the sciences of Islam. He was joined by Zaid Shakir and Hatem Bazian in establishing what was then Zaytuna Institute. In fall 2010, it opened its doors as Zaytuna College, a four-year Muslim liberal arts college, the first of its kind in the United States. It incorporates Yusuf&#x27;s vision of combining the classical liberal arts—based in the trivium and quadrivium—with rigorous training in traditional Islamic disciplines. It aims to &quot;educate and prepare morally committed professional, intellectual, and spiritual leaders&quot;. Zaytuna College became the first accredited Muslim campus in the United States after it received approval from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Yusuf stated that &quot;We hope, God willing, that there will be more such Muslim colleges and universities to come&quot;.

=== Interfaith ===
Yusuf participates in the Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies hosted by the UAE. He praised the UAE for its increasing tolerance and its adoption of multi-faith initiatives and plans to build a multi-faith centre in Abu Dhabi.

==Views and influence==
Jordan&#x27;s Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre currently places him 36th on its list of the top 500 most influential Muslims in the world. In its 2016 edition, Yusuf is described &quot;as one of the foremost authorities on Islam outside of the Muslim world&quot; by &quot;The 500 Most Influential Muslims&quot;, edited by John Esposito and Ibrahim Kalin. Additionally, Journalist Graeme Wood has referred to Yusuf &quot;one the two most prominent Muslim scholars in the United States today&quot;. 

Yusuf has taken a stance against religious justifications for terrorist attacks. He described the 9/11 attacks as &quot;an act of mass murder, pure and simple&quot;. Condemning the attacks, he also stated that &quot;Islam was hijacked ... on that plane as an innocent victim.&quot;

Yusuf is one of the signatories of A Common Word Between Us and You, an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders calling for peace and understanding. Yusuf was also one of the signatories of an open letter to former ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi that sought to refute the principles promoted by the terrorist organization.

Hamza Yusuf has been involved in controversies in recent years on issues of race, politics, and the Arab revolutions, including as a result of his support for the Abraham Accords and UAE government, and for &quot;positing blame on the Palestinians for their suffering&quot;.

=== Comments on the Syrian Revolution ===
In 2019, in reference to Arab Spring protests against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Yusuf criticized the Syrian Revolution, stating that &quot;If you humiliate a ruler, God will humiliate you.&quot; Although some viewed these comments as supportive of the Syrian regime, this has been rejected by Yusuf, who made a statement of response.

=== 2016 Black Lives Matter comments ===
In December 2016, Yusuf made comments that were perceived as critical of the tactics employed by the Black Lives Matter movement. He argued that, &quot;The United States is probably, in terms of its laws, one of the least racist societies in the world.&quot; He also stated that, “We have between 15,000 and 18,000 homicides per year. Fifty percent are black-on-black crime, literally.&quot; He added, &quot;There are twice as many whites that have been shot by police, but nobody ever shows those videos.” Yusuf was criticized for these comments, including on social media. Zaid Shakir, co-founder of Zaytuna College, defended Yusuf, writing that &quot;I can say with absolute confidence that there is not a racist bone in Shaykh Hamza’s body. A racist is someone who believes in the superiority of one race over another. Shaykh Hamza, like any serious Muslim, totally rejects that idea.&quot;

<doc id="269960" wikidata="Q636261" url="?curid=269960" title="Heim ins Reich">
<text>The Heim ins Reich (; meaning &quot;back home to the Reich&quot;) was a foreign policy pursued by Adolf Hitler before and during World War II, beginning in October 1936 [see Nazi Four Year Plan; Grams, 2021; Grams 2025]. The aim of Hitler&#x27;s initiative was to convince all &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic Germans) who were living outside Nazi Germany (e.g. in Austria, Czechoslovakia and the western districts of Poland) that they should strive to bring these regions &quot;home&quot; into Greater Germany, but also relocate from territories that were not under German control, following the conquest of Poland, in accordance with the Nazi–Soviet pact. The &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; manifesto targeted areas ceded in Versailles to the newly reborn state of Poland, various lands of immigration, as well as other areas that were inhabited by significant ethnic German populations, such as the Sudetenland, Danzig (now Gdansk), and the southeastern and northeastern regions of Europe after 6 October 1939.

Implementation of the policy was managed by VOMI (&quot;Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle&quot; or &quot;Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans&quot;). As a state agency of the NSDAP, it handled all &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; issues. By 1941, the VOMI was under the control of the SS.

==History==
The end of World War I in Europe led to the emergence of new &#x27;minority problems&#x27; in the areas of collapsing German and Austro-Hungarian empires. As a result of the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, more than 9 million ethnic Germans found themselves living in newly organized Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Unlike the new sovereign states, Germany was not required to sign the Minority Treaties.

Prior to the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938, a powerful radio transmitter in Munich bombarded Austria with propaganda of what Hitler had already done for Germany, and what he could do for his native home country Austria. The annexation of Austria was presented by the press as the march of the German armed forces into purported German land: &quot;as representatives of a general German will to unity, to establish brotherhood with the German people and soldiers there&quot;. In a similar manner, the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania, leading to the annexation of Memel from the Republic, was glorified as Hitler&#x27;s &quot;latest stage in the progress of history&quot;.

After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria, Germany popularized the &quot;Back home to the Reich&quot; slogan among Sudeten Germans. During the Czech crisis, Hitler visited the German Gymnastics and Sports Festival in Breslau. When the Sudeten team passed the VIP stand where Hitler was, they shouted &quot;Back home to the Reich!&quot; Josef Goebbels noted in his diary that &quot;The people yelled, cheered and cried. The Führer [Hitler] was deeply moved.&quot;

On 7 October 1939, immediately after the end of the Germany&#x27;s Polish Campaign, Hitler appointed Heinrich Himmler as Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV).
Duties of the new position included furthering the &quot;return&quot; of and organising newly-conquered territory for German settlement.

Concurrent with annexations were the beginnings of attempts to ethnically cleanse non-Germans both from Germany and from the areas intended to be part of a &quot;Greater Germany&quot;. Alternately, Hitler also made attempts to Germanize those who were considered ethnically or racially close enough to Germans to be &quot;worth keeping&quot; as part of a future German nation, such as the population of Luxembourg. Germany officially considered these populations to &quot;be&quot; German, but not part of the Greater German Reich, and were thus the targets of propaganda promoting this view in order to integrate them. These attempts were largely unpopular with the targets of the Germanization. Up to 97 percent of Luxembourgers voted in a 1941 referendum against being recognized as German.

Propaganda was also directed to Germans outside Nazi Germany to return as regions, or as individuals from other regions. Hitler hoped to make full use of the &quot;German Diaspora&quot;. As part of an effort to lure ethnic Germans back to Germany, folksy &quot;Heimatbriefe&quot; or &quot;letters from the homeland&quot; were sent to German immigrants to the United States. The reaction to these was on the whole negative, particularly as the letters increased in volume. Goebbels also hoped to use German-Americans to keep America neutral during the war, but his actions produced among them great hostility to Nazi propagandists. Newspapers in occupied Ukraine printed articles about antecedents of German rule over Ukraine, such as Catherine the Great and the Goths.

==&quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; in occupied Poland 1939–1944==
The same motto (&quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; ) was also applied to a second, closely related policy initiative which entailed the displacement and relocation of ethnically German communities (&quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; ) from Central and Eastern European countries in the Soviet &quot;sphere of influence&quot;, whose ancestors had settled there during the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot; of earlier centuries. The Nazi government determined which of these communities were not &quot;viable&quot;, started propaganda among the local population, and made arrangements and organized their transport of such communities. Its use of scare tactics about the Soviet Union resulted in tens of thousands of persons leaving. They included ethnic Germans from Bukovina, Bessarabia, Dobruja and Yugoslavia. For example, after the Soviets had assumed control of this territory, about 45,000 ethnic Germans left Northern Bukovina by November 1940. (Stalin permitted this out of fear they would be loyal to Germany.)

In the Greater Poland (&quot;Wielkopolska&quot; ) region (joined together with the Łódź district and dubbed &quot;Wartheland&quot; by the Germans), the Nazis&#x27; goal was complete Germanization, or political, cultural, social, and economic assimilation of the territory into the German Reich. In pursuit of this goal, the installed bureaucracy renamed streets and cities and seized tens of thousands of Polish enterprises, from large industrial firms to small shops, without payment to the owners. This area incorporated 350,000 such &quot;ethnic Germans&quot; and 1.7 million Poles deemed Germanizable, including between one and two hundred thousand children who had been taken from their parents (plus about 400,000 German settlers from the &quot;Old Reich&quot;). They were housed in farms left vacant by expulsion of the local Poles. Militant party members were sent to teach them to be &quot;true Germans&quot;. Hitler Youth and League of German Girls sent young people for &quot;Eastern Service&quot;, which entailed (particularly for the girls) assisting in Germanization efforts. They were harassed by Polish partisans (Armia Krajowa) during the war. As Nazi Germany lost the war, these ethnic Germans were expelled to remaining Germany.

Eberhardt cites estimates for the ethnic German influx provided by Szobak, Łuczak, and a collective report, ranging from 404,612 (Szobak) to 631,500 (Łuczak). Anna Bramwell says 591,000 ethnic Germans moved into the annexed territories, and details the areas of colonists&#x27; origin as follows: 93,000 were from Bessarabia, 21,000 from Dobruja, 98,000 from Bukovina, 68,000 from Volhynia, 58,000 from Galicia, 130,000 from the Baltic states, 38,000 from eastern Poland, 72,000 from the Sudetenland, and 13,000 from Slovenia.

Additionally some 400,000 German officials, technical staff, and clerks were sent to those areas in order to administer them, according to &quot;Atlas Ziem Polski&quot; citing a joint Polish–German scholarly publication on the aspect of population changes during the war Eberhardt estimates that the total influx from the Altreich was about 500,000 people. Duiker and Spielvogel note that up to two million Germans had been settled in pre-war Poland by 1942. Eberhardt gives a total of two million Germans present in the area of all pre-war Poland by the end of the war, 1.3 million of whom moved in during the war, adding to a pre-war population of 700,000.

The increase of German population was most visible in the urban centres: in Poznań, the German population increased from around 6,000 in 1939 to 93,589 in 1944; in Łódź, from around 60,000 to 140,721; and in Inowrocław, from 956 to 10,713. In Warthegau, where most Germans were settled, the share of the German population increased from 6.6% in 1939 to 21.2% in 1943.

<doc id="269967" wikidata="Q7414228" url="?curid=269967" title="San Geronimo Valley">
<text>San Geronimo Valley is located in Marin County, California, composed of four unincorporated towns: Woodacre, San Geronimo, Forest Knolls, and Lagunitas. It is a fairly close-knit community, with a rather liberal citizenry. The farther west one goes along the valley, the more forested the land becomes. The valley is bisected roughly east-to-west by Sir Francis Drake Boulevard; a number of streets in the towns along this road were constructed on the former right-of-way of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. The valley has numerous hiking/biking trails. Most of the residents reside on the south, shadier, side of the valley. 

The San Geronimo Valley derives its name from the San Geronimo Ranch, established by Adolph Mailliard and Ann Eliza Ward in 1868, where they bred thoroughbred horses, including the famous stallion Monday, who sired most of the race horses in California.
The Valley is part of the Lagunitas School District, unique in that it operates two alternative elementary programs and a traditional middle school program on two connected campuses with one superintendent, one principal, and one school board. Each elementary program (Open Classroom, Montessori-inspired) has its own unique philosophy and pedagogical methods, all working within the framework of the California professional and academic standards. Each program involves parent participation to some degree.

Woodacre is home to Spirit Rock Meditation Center, dedicated to the teachings of Buddha and Vipasannā mediation; Dickson Ranch, and the Marin County Fire Department headquarters. San Geronimo Valley also comprises the greater part of the Lagunitas Watershed, in which some of the last remaining coho salmon spawn. The San Geronimo Valley Community Center, attached to the school district, is a hub for community events and hosts the local food bank.

<text>A clapperboard, also known as a dumb slate, clapboard, film clapper, film slate, movie slate, or production slate, is a device used in filmmaking, television production and video production to assist in synchronizing of picture and sound, and to designate and mark the various scenes and takes as they are filmed and audio-recorded. It is operated by the clapper loader. It is said to have been invented by Australian filmmaker F. W. Thring. Due to its ubiquity on film sets, the clapperboard is frequently featured in behind-the-scenes footage and films about filmmaking, and has become an enduring symbol of the film industry as a whole.

==History==

In the silent era the principal requirement of film stock identification during a day&#x27;s shoot was the slate.

The clapper as two sticks hinged together was invented by F. W. Thring (father of actor Frank Thring), who later became head of Efftee Studios in Melbourne, Australia. The clapperboard with both the sticks and slate together was a refinement of Leon M. Leon (1903–1998), a pioneer sound engineer.

==Description==
The clapperboard combines a chalkboard slate or acrylic board with a set of clapper sticks across the top; one stick is fixed to the upper edge of the slate, while the other is attached to it by a hinge at one end. The slate displays the name of the production, the scene and &quot;take&quot; about to be performed, and similar information; a camera assistant holds the clapperboard so the slate is in view of the cameras with the clapper sticks already open, speaks out information for the benefit of the audio recording, then snaps the sticks shut.

The shutting of the clapper sticks is easily identified on the visual track, and the sharp &quot;clap&quot; noise is easily identified on the separate audio track. The two tracks can later be precisely synchronized by matching the sound and movement. Since each take is expressly identified on both the visual and audio tracks, segments of film are easily matched with corresponding segments of audio.

==Purpose==

Finding a way to synchronize visual and audio tracks was essential to traditional filmmaking because film stock reacts to light, not sound. During a film shoot, the audio track was always recorded by the audio engineer with a separate system on separate media (so-called double-system recording). (For early sound films, playback of the audio track was synchronized during post-production with sound-on-disc techniques; engineers later figured out how to directly add an audio track to a release print with sound-on-film techniques.) Failure to use clapperboards can prevent the film editor from synchronizing the visual images on film footage with the accompanying audio recordings, as actually happened with the long-delayed film &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

Methods were later developed to directly record sound to film as part of a single system integrated with the film camera (so-called single-system recording), which was most commonly used with small formats like Super 8 film. However, single-system recording did not render clapperboards obsolete. First, single-system recording of sound-on-film is &quot;decidedly inferior in audio quality&quot; to traditional double-system recording. Second, footage from single-system recording is difficult to shoot and edit. Since the sound playback head cannot block the projector gate and must be placed after the gate, the soundtrack must be offset by several frames (usually 28, 26, or 18 ahead) to maintain sync with the frame in the gate. With such footage, cutting to the next shot when an actor&#x27;s lips stop moving will risk cutting off their last syllable, unless the soundtrack is copied and edited on a separate system, and actors must be directed to pause to allow for such cuts. Because of these technical limitations, the film industry has continued to use double-system recording for professional-quality film projects.

==Construction==

A traditional clapperboard (i.e., a dumb slate) consists of a wooden slate with a hinged clapper stick attached to its top. A modern clapperboard generally uses a pair of wooden sticks atop either a whiteboard or a translucent acrylic glass slate (the latter being easily legible via the light coming through it from the scene about to be shot). The clapper sticks traditionally have diagonally interleaved lines of black and white to ensure the camera can capture a clear visual image of the clap in most lighting conditions. In recent years sticks with calibrated color stripes have become available.

A digislate is a clapperboard with an inbuilt electronic box displaying SMPTE time codes. The timecode displayed on the clapperboard will have been jam synced with the internal clock of the camera, so that in theory it should be easy for the film editor to pull the timecode metadata from the video file and sound clip and synchronize them together. However, electronic timecodes can still drift during a long shooting day, so the clapper sticks on the clapperboard still need to be closed together in order to ensure there is a way of manually synchronizing the footage and audio if matching the digital timecode fails.

==Operation==

The slate typically includes the date, the production title, the name of the director, the name of the director of photography (DoP) and the scene information — which follows two popular systems:
# American: scene number, camera angle and take number; e.g. &quot;scene 24, C, take 3&quot;;
# European: slate number, take number (with the letter of the camera shooting the slate if using multiple-camera setup); e.g. &quot;slate 256, take 3C&quot;. Often, the European system will also include the scene number; however, a separate &quot;continuity sheet&quot; that maps the &quot;slate&quot; number to the scene number, camera angle and take number may be used if the scene number is not included on the slate. This is generally not as great a concern with short films, however.

A verbal identification of the numbers, known either as &quot;voice slate&quot; or &quot;announcement&quot;, occurs after sound has reached speed. At the same time or shortly thereafter, the camera will start running, and the clapperboard is then filmed briefly at the start of the take; its two sticks are snapped sharply together as soon as the camera has reached sync speed. Specific procedures vary depending on the nature of the production (documentary, television, feature, commercial, etc.), and the dominant camera assisting regional conventions.

A clapperboard is generally used to identify all takes on a production, even takes that do not require synchronization, such as MOS takes, which have no sound. When a slate is used to mark an MOS take, the slate is held half open, with a hand blocking the sticks, or closed, with a hand over the sticks.

===Operator===
The clapper loader (or 2nd AC) is generally responsible for the maintenance and operation of the clapperboard, while the script supervisor is responsible for determining which system will be used and what numbers a given take should have. While these are usually fairly obvious once a system has been agreed upon, the script supervisor is usually considered the final arbiter in the event of an unclear situation.

===Alternatives===
Sometimes a &quot;tail slate&quot; or end slate is filmed at the end of a take, during which the clapperboard is held upside-down. This is done when the slate was not captured at the start of the take due to the camera being set up for the shot in such a way that the board cannot be captured, for example when a specific focus or frame is set up and cannot be altered until the take is complete. Tail slates are also commonly used when the director makes the decision that clapping a slate at the beginning of the scene would be distracting to the actor, such as when filming a highly emotional performance.

<text>Roberto Cofresí y Ramírez de Arellano (June 17, 1791 – March 29, 1825), better known as El Pirata Cofresí, was a pirate from Puerto Rico. He was born into a noble family, but the political and economic difficulties faced by the island as a colony of the Spanish Empire during the regional independence wars against the metropole meant that his household was poor. Cofresí worked at sea from an early age which familiarized him with the region&#x27;s geography, but it provided only a modest salary, and he eventually decided to abandon the sailor&#x27;s life and became a pirate. He had previous links to land-based criminal activities, but the reason for Cofresí&#x27;s change of vocation is unknown; historians speculate that he may have worked as a privateer aboard &quot;El Scipión&quot;, a ship owned by one of his cousins.

At the height of his career, Cofresí evaded capture by vessels from Spain, Gran Colombia, the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, and the United States. He commanded several small-draft vessels, the best known a fast six-gun sloop named &quot;Anne&quot;, and he had a preference for speed and maneuverability over firepower. He manned them with small, rotating crews which most contemporaneous documents numbered at 10 to 20. He preferred to outrun his pursuers, but his flotilla engaged the West Indies Squadron twice, attacking the schooners and . Most crew members were recruited locally, although men occasionally joined them from the other Antilles, Central America, and Europe. He never confessed to murder, but he reportedly boasted about his crimes, and 300 to 400 people died as a result of his pillaging, mostly foreigners.

Cofresí proved too much for local authorities, who accepted international help to capture the pirate; Spain created an alliance with the West Indies Squadron and the Danish government of Saint Thomas. On March 5, 1825, the alliance set a trap which forced &quot;Anne&quot; into a naval battle. After 45 minutes, Cofresí abandoned his ship and escaped overland; he was recognized by a resident who ambushed and injured him. Cofresí was captured and imprisoned, making a last unsuccessful attempt to escape by trying to bribe an official with part of a hidden stash. The pirates were sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where a brief military tribunal found them guilty and sentenced them to death. On March 29, 1825, Cofresí and most of his crew were executed by firing squad.

He inspired stories and myths after his death, most emphasizing a Robin Hood-like &quot;steal from the rich, give to the poor&quot; philosophy which became associated with him. This portrayal has grown into legend, commonly accepted as fact in Puerto Rico and throughout the West Indies. Some of these claim that Cofresí became part of the Puerto Rican independence movement and other secessionist initiatives, including Simón Bolívar&#x27;s campaign against Spain. Historical and mythical accounts of his life have inspired songs, poems, plays, books, and films. In Puerto Rico, caves, beaches, and other alleged hideouts or locations of buried treasure have been named after Cofresí, and a resort town is named for him near Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic.

==Early years==
===Lineage===

In 1945, historian Enrique Ramírez Brau speculated that Cofresí may have had Jewish ancestry. A theory, held by David Cuesta and historian Ursula Acosta (a member of the Puerto Rican Genealogy Society), held that the name Kupferstein (&quot;copper stone&quot;) may have been chosen by his family when the 18th-century European Jewish population adopted surnames. The theory was later discarded when their research uncovered a complete family tree prepared by Cofresí&#x27;s cousin, Luigi de Jenner, indicating that their name was spelled Kupferschein (not Kupferstein). Originally from Prague, Cofresí paternal patriarch Cristoforo Kupferschein received a recognition and coat of arms from Ferdinand I of Austria in December 1549 and eventually moved to Trieste. His last name was probably adapted from the town of Kufstein. After its arrival, the family became one of Trieste&#x27;s early settlers. Cristoforo&#x27;s son Felice was recognized as a noble in 1620, becoming Edler von Kupferschein. The family gained prestige and became one of the city&#x27;s wealthiest, with the next generation receiving the best possible education and marrying into other influential families. Cofresí&#x27;s grandfather, Giovanni Giuseppe Stanislao de Kupferschein, held several offices in the police, military and municipal administration. According to Acosta, Cofresí&#x27;s father Francesco Giuseppe Fortunato von Kupferschein received a &quot;lateinschule&quot; education and left at age 19 for Frankfurt (probably in search of a university or legal practice). In Frankfurt he mingled with influential figures such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, returning to Trieste two years later.

As a cosmopolitan, mercantile city Trieste was a probable hub of illicit trade, and Francesco was forced to leave after he killed Josephus Steffani on July 31, 1778. Although Steffani&#x27;s death is commonly attributed to a duel, given their acquaintanceship (both worked at a criminal court) it may have been related to illegal activity. Francesco&#x27;s name and those of four sailors soon became linked to the murder. Convicted &quot;in absentia&quot;, the fugitive remained in touch with his family. Francesco went to Barcelona, reportedly learning Spanish there. By 1784 he had settled in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, a harbor town recently separated from the municipality of San Germán and made the seat of an eponymous municipality, where he was accepted by the local aristocracy with the Spanish honorific Don (&quot;of noble origin&quot;). Francesco&#x27;s name was Hispanicized to Francisco José Cofresí (his third given name was not), which was easier for his neighbors to pronounce. Since he was linked to illegal commerce in his homeland, he probably relocated to Cabo Rojo for strategic reasons; its harbor was far from San Juan, the capital. Francisco soon met María Germana Ramírez de Arellano y Segarra, and they married. His wife was born to Clemente Ramírez de Arellano y del Toro y Quiñones Rivera, a noble and first cousin of town founder Nicolás Ramírez de Arellano y Martínez de Matos. Her paternal family, descended from the Jimena royal dynasty of the Kingdom of Navarre and the first royal house of the Kingdom of Aragón (said house was established by a Jimena prince), owned a significant amount of land in Cabo Rojo. After their marriage the couple settled in El Tujao (or El Tujado), near the coast. Francisco&#x27;s father Giovanni died in 1789, and a petition pardoning him for Steffani&#x27;s murder a decade before was granted two years later (enabling him to return to Trieste). However, no evidence exists that Francisco ever returned to the city.

===Penniless nobleman and marauder===
The Spanish American wars of independence had repercussions in Puerto Rico; due to widespread privateering and other naval warfare, maritime commerce suffered heavily. Cabo Rojo was among the municipalities affected most, with its ports at a virtual standstill. African slaves took to the sea in an attempt at freedom; merchants were assessed higher taxes and harassed by foreigners. Under these conditions, Cofresí was born to Francisco and María Germana. The youngest of four children, he had one sister (Juana) and two brothers (Juan Francisco and Juan Ignacio). Cofresí was baptized into the Catholic Church by José de Roxas, the first priest in Cabo Rojo, when he was fifteen days old. María died when Cofresí was four years old, and an aunt assumed his upbringing. Francisco then began a relationship with María Sanabria, the mother of his last child Julián. A &quot;don&quot; by birth, Cofresí&#x27;s education was above average; since there is no evidence of a school in Cabo Rojo at that time, Francisco may have educated his children or hired a tutor. The Cofresís, raised in a multicultural environment, probably knew Dutch and Italian. In November 1814 Francisco died, leaving a modest estate; Roberto was probably homeless, with no income.

On January 14, 1815, three months after his father&#x27;s death, Cofresí married Juana Creitoff in San Miguel Arcángel parish, Cabo Rojo. Contemporary documents are unclear about her birthplace; although it is also listed as Curaçao, she was probably born in Cabo Rojo to Dutch parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to a residence bought for 50 pesos by Creitoff&#x27;s father, Geraldo. Months later Cofresí&#x27;s father in-law lost his humble home in a fire, plunging the family into debt. Three years after his marriage Cofresí owned no property and lived with his mother-in-law, Anna Cordelia. He established ties with residents of San Germán, including his brothers-in-law: the wealthy merchant Don Jacobo Ufret and Don Manuel Ufret. The couple struggled to begin a family of their own, conceiving two sons (Juan and Francisco Matías) who died soon after birth.

Although he belonged to a prestigious family, Cofresí was not wealthy. In 1818 he paid 17 maravedís in taxes, spending most of his time at sea and earning a low wage. According to historian Walter Cardona Bonet, Cofresí probably worked in a number of fishing corrals in Boquerón Bay. The corrals belonged to the aristocrat Cristóbal Pabón Dávila, a friend of municipal port captain José Mendoza. This connection is believed to have later protected Cofresí, since Mendoza was godfather to several of his brother Juan Francisco&#x27;s children. The following year he first appeared on a government registry as a sailor, and there is no evidence linking him to any other jobs in Cabo Rojo. Although Cofresí&#x27;s brothers were maritime merchants and sailed a boat, &quot;Avispa&quot;, he probably worked as an able fisherman. On December 28, 1819, Cofresí was registered on &quot;Ramona&quot;, ferrying goods between the southern municipalities. In addition, her frequent voyages to the Mona Passage and Cofresí&#x27;s recognition by local residents indicate that he occasionally accompanied &quot;Avispa&quot; That year, Cofresí and Juana lived in Barrio del Pueblo and paid higher taxes than the previous year: five reales.

Political changes in Spain affected Puerto Rico&#x27;s stability during the first two decades of the 19th century. Europeans and refugees from the American colonies began arriving after the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815, changing the archipelago&#x27;s economic and political environments. With strategic acquisitions, the new arrivals triggered a rise in prices. Food distribution was inefficient, particularly in non-agricultural areas. Unmotivated and desperate, the local population drifted toward crime and dissipation. By 1816, governor Salvador Meléndez Bruna shifted responsibility for law enforcement from the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico to the mayors. Driven by hunger and poverty, highway robbers continued to roam southern and central Puerto Rico. In 1817 wealthy San Germán residents requested help with the criminals, who were invading houses and shops. The following year, Meléndez established a high-security prison at El Arsenal in San Juan. During the next few years, the governor transferred repeat offenders to San Juan. Cabo Rojo, with its high crime rate, also dealt with civil strife, inefficient law enforcement and corrupt officials. While he was still a &quot;don&quot;, Cofresí led a criminal gang in San Germán which stole cattle, food and crops. He was linked to an organization operating near the Hormigueros barrio since at least 1818 and to another nobleman, Juan Geraldo Bey. Among Cofresí&#x27;s associates were Juan de los Reyes, José Cartagena and Francisco Ramos, and the criminals continued to thrive in 1820. The situation worsened with the arrival of unauthorized street vendors from nearby municipalities, who were soon robbed. A series of storms and droughts drove residents away from Cabo Rojo, worsening the already-poor economy; authorities retrained the unemployed and underemployed as night watchmen.

The regional harvest was destroyed by a September 28, 1820, hurricane, triggering the region&#x27;s largest crime wave to date. Newly appointed Puerto Rican governor Gonzalo Aróstegui Herrera immediately ordered Lieutenant Antonio Ordóñez to round up as many criminals as possible. On November 22, 1820, a group of fifteen men from Cabo Rojo participated in the highway robbery of Francisco de Rivera, Nicolás Valdés and Francisco Lamboy on the outskirts of Yauco. Cofresí is believed to have been involved in this incident because of its timing and the criminals&#x27; link to an area headed by his friend, Cristóbal Pabón Dávila. The incident sparked an uproar in towns throughout the region, and convinced the governor that the authorities were conspiring with the criminals. Among measures taken by Aróstegui were a mayoral election in Cabo Rojo (Juan Evangelista Ramírez de Arellano, one of Cofresí&#x27;s relatives, was elected) and an investigation of the former mayor. The incoming mayor was ordered to control crime in the region, an unrealistic demand with the resources at his disposal. Bernardo Pabón Davila, a friend of Cofresí and relative of Cristóbal, was assigned to prosecute the Yauco incident. Bernardo reportedly protected the accused and argued against pursuing the case, saying that according to &quot;private confidences&quot; they were fleeing to the United States. Other initiatives to capture highway robbers in Cabo Rojo were more successful, resulting in over a dozen arrests; among them was the nobleman Bey, who was charged with murder. Known as &quot;El Holandés&quot;, Bey testified that Cofresí led a criminal gang. Cofresí&#x27;s primary collaborators were the Ramírez de Arellano family, who prevented his capture as Cabo Rojo&#x27;s founding family with high positions in politics and law enforcement. The central government issued wanted posters for Cofresí, and in July 1821 he and the rest of his gang were captured; Bey escaped, becoming a fugitive. Cofresí and his men were tried in San Germán&#x27;s courthouse, where their connection to several crimes was proven.

On August 17, 1821 (while Cofresí was in prison) Juana gave birth to their only daughter, Bernardina. Due to his noble status, Cofresí probably received a pass for the birth and took the opportunity to escape; in alternative theories, he broke out or was released on parole. While Cofresí was a fugitive, Bernardo Pabón Davila was Bernardina&#x27;s godfather and Felícita Asencio her godmother. On December 4, 1821, a wanted poster was circulated by San Germán mayor Pascacio Cardona. There is little documentation of Cofresí&#x27;s whereabouts in 1822. Historians have suggested that he exploited his upper-class connections to remain concealed; the Ramírez de Arellano family held most regional public offices, and their influence extended beyond the region. Other wealthy families, including the Beys, had similarly protected their relatives and Cofresí may have hidden in plain sight due to the inertia of Cabo Rojo authorities. When he became a wanted man, he moved Juana and Anna to her brothers&#x27; houses and would visit in secret; Juana also visited him at his headquarters in the rural ward of Pedernales in Cabo Rojo. It is unknown how far Cofresí traveled during this time, but he had associates on the east coast and may have taken advantage of eastern migration from Cabo Rojo. Although he may have been captured and imprisoned in San Juan, he does not appear in contemporary records. However, Cofresí&#x27;s associates Juan &quot;El Indio&quot; de los Reyes, Francisco Ramos and José &quot;Pepe&quot; Cartagena were released only months before his recorded reappearance.

==&quot;Last of the West India pirates&quot;==
===Establishing a reputation===
By 1823 Cofresí was probably on the crew of the corsair barquentine &quot;El Scipión&quot;, captained by José Ramón Torres and managed by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayagüez, José María Ramírez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several of his friends and family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofresí may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills he would use later in life. &quot;El Scipión&quot; employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard (as she did in capturing the British frigate &quot;Aurora&quot; and the American brigantine &quot;Otter&quot;). The capture of &quot;Otter&quot; led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofresí turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In &quot;Orígenes portorriqueños&quot; Ramírez Brau speculates that Cofresí&#x27;s time aboard &quot;El Scipión&quot;, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew&#x27;s pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Acosta, a lack of work for privateers ultimately pushed Cofresí into piracy.

The timing of this decision was crucial in establishing him as the dominant Caribbean pirate of the era. Cofresí began his new career in early 1823, filling a role vacant in the Spanish Main since the death of Jean Lafitte, and was the last major target of West Indies anti-piracy operations. While piracy was heavily monitored and most pirates were rarely successful, Cofresí was confirmed to have plundered at least eight vessels and has been credited with over 70 captures. Unlike his predecessors, Cofresí is not known to have imposed a pirate code on his crew; his leadership was enhanced by an audacious personality, a trait acknowledged even by his pursuers. According to 19th-century reports he had a rule of engagement that when a vessel was captured, only those willing to join his crew were permitted to live. Cofresí&#x27;s influence extended to a large number of civil informants and associates, forming a network which took 14 years after his death to fully dismantle.

The earliest document linked to Cofresí&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; is a letter dated July 5, 1823, from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, which was published in the &quot;St. Thomas Gazette&quot;. The letter reported that a brigantine, loaded with coffee and West Indian indigo from La Guaira, was boarded by pirates on June 12. The hijackers ordered the ship brought to Isla de Mona (incorrectly anglicized as &quot;Monkey Island&quot;), a small island in the eponymous passage between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, where its captain and crew were ordered to unload the cargo. After this was done, the pirates reportedly killed the sailors and sank the brigantine. Both of Cofresí&#x27;s brothers were soon involved in his operation, helping him move plunder and deal with captured ships. Juan Francisco was able to gather information about maritime traffic in his work at the port, presumably forwarding it to his brother. The pirates communicated with their cohorts through coastal signs, and their associates on land warned them of danger; the system was probably used to identify loaded vessels as well. According to Puerto Rican historian Aurelio Tió, Cofresí shared his loot with the needy (especially family members and close friends) and was considered the Puerto Rican equivalent of Robin Hood. Acosta disagrees, saying that any acts of generosity were probably opportunistic. Cardona Bonet&#x27;s research suggests that Cofresí organized improvised markets in Cabo Rojo, where plunder would be informally sold; according to this theory, merchant families would buy goods for resale to the public. The process was facilitated by local collaborators, such as French smuggler Juan Bautista Buyé.

On October 28, 1823, months after the &quot;El Scipión&quot; case was settled, Cofresí attacked a ship registered to the harbor of Patillas and robbed the small fishing boat of 800 pesos in cash. Cofresí attacked with other members of his gang and that of another pirate, Manuel Lamparo, who was connected to British pirate Samuel McMorren (also known as Juan Bron). That week he also led the capture of &quot;John&quot;, an American schooner. Out of Newburyport and captained by Daniel Knight, on its way to Mayagüez the ship was intercepted by a ten-ton schooner armed with a swivel gun near Desecheo Island. Cofresí&#x27;s group, consisting of seven pirates armed with sabers and muskets, stole $1,000 in cash, tobacco, tar and other provisions and the vessel&#x27;s square rig and mainsail. Cofresí ordered the crew to head for Santo Domingo, threatening to kill everyone aboard if they were seen at any Puerto Rican port. Despite the threat, Knight went to Mayagüez and reported the incident. 

It was soon established that some of the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a larger group which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo&#x27;s inefficiency, demanded the pirates&#x27; capture and western Puerto Rico military commander José Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofresí was tracked to the beach in Peñones, near his brothers&#x27; homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the &quot;John&quot;″s sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan José Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofresí to the two hijackings.

Cofresí&#x27;s sudden success was an oddity, nearly a century after the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. By this time, joint governmental efforts had eradicated rampant buccaneering by Anglo-French seamen (primarily based on Jamaica and Tortuga), which had turned the Caribbean into a haven for pirates attacking shipments from the region&#x27;s Spanish colonies; this made his capture a priority. By late 1823, the pursuit on land probably forced Cofresí to move his main base of operations to Mona; the following year, he was often there. This base, initially a temporary haven with Barrio Pedernales his stable outpost, became more heavily used. Easily accessible from Cabo Rojo, Mona had been associated with pirates for more than a century; it was visited by William Kidd, who landed in 1699 after fleeing with a load of gold, silver and iron. A second pirate base was found at Saona, an island south of Hispaniola.

In November a number of sailors aboard &quot;El Scipión&quot; took advantage of her officers&#x27; shore leave and mutinied, seizing control of the ship. The vessel, repurposed as a pirate ship, began operating in the Mona Passage and was later seen at Mayagüez before disappearing from the record. Cofresí was linked to &quot;El Scipión&quot; by pirate Jaime Márquez, who admitted under police questioning on Saint Thomas that boatswain Manuel Reyes Paz was a Cofresí associate. The confession hints that the ship was captured by Hispaniola authorities. Cofresí is recorded in eastern Hispaniola (then part of the unified Republic of Haiti, modern-day Dominican Republic), where his crew reportedly rested off Puerto Plata province. On one excursion, the pirates were intercepted by Spanish patrol boats off the coast of Samaná Province. With no apparent escape route, Cofresí is said to have ordered the vessel&#x27;s sinking and it sailed into Bahía de Samaná before coming to rest near the town of Punta Gorda. This created a diversion, allowing him and his crew to escape in skiffs they rowed to shore and adjacent wetlands (where the larger Spanish ships could not follow). The remains of the ship, reportedly full of plunder, have not been found.

In an article in the May 9, 1936, issue of &quot;Puerto Rico Ilustrado&quot;, Eugenio Astol described an 1823 incident between Cofresí and Puerto Rican physician and politician Pedro Gerónimo Goyco. The 15-year-old Goyco traveled alone on a schooner to a Santo Domingo school for his secondary education. In mid-voyage, Cofresí intercepted the ship and the pirates boarded it. Cofresí assembled the passengers, asking their names and those of their parents. When he learned that Goyco was among them, the pirate ordered a change of course; they landed on a beach near Mayagüez, where Goyco was freed. Cofresí explained that he knew Goyco&#x27;s father, an immigrant from Herceg Novi named Gerónimo Goicovich who had settled in Mayagüez. Goyco returned home safely, later attempting the voyage again. The elder Goicovich had favored members of Cofresí&#x27;s family, despite their association with a pirate. Goyco grew up to become a militant abolitionist, similar to Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis.

Cofresí&#x27;s actions quickly gained the attention of the Anglo-American nations, who called him &quot;Cofrecinas&quot; (a mistranslated, onomatopoeic variant of his last name). Commercial agent and US Consul Judah Lord wrote to Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, describing the &quot;El Scipión&quot; situation and the capture of &quot;John&quot;. Adams relayed the information to Commodore David Porter, leader of the anti-piracy West Indies Squadron, who sent several ships to Puerto Rico. On November 27 Cofresí sailed from his base on Mona with two sloops (armed with pivot gun cannons) and assaulted another American ship, the brigantine &quot;William Henry&quot;. The &quot;Salem Gazette&quot; reported that the following month a schooner sailed from Santo Domingo to Saona, capturing 18 pirates (including Manuel Reyes Paz) and a &quot;considerable quantity&quot; of leather, coffee, indigo, and cash.

===International manhunt===
Cofresí&#x27;s victims were locals and foreigners, and the region was economically destabilized. When he boarded Spanish vessels he usually targeted immigrants brought by the royal decree of 1815, ignoring his fellow &quot;criollos&quot;. The situation was complicated by several factors, most of them geopolitical. The Spanish Empire had lost most of its possessions in the New World, and her last two territories (Puerto Rico and Cuba) faced economic problems and political unrest. To undermine the commerce of former colonies, Spain stopped issuing letters of marque; this left sailors unemployed, and they gravitated towards Cofresí and piracy. On the diplomatic front, the pirates assaulted foreign ships while flying the Flag of Spain (angering nations who had reached an agreement about the return of ships captured by corsairs and compensation for losses). Aware that the problem had developed international overtones, Spanish-appointed governor of Puerto Rico Lt. Gen. Miguel Luciano de la Torre y Pando (1822–1837) made Cofresí&#x27;s capture a priority. By December 1823 other nations joined the effort to combat Cofresí, sending warships to the Mona Passage. Gran Colombia sent two corvettes, &quot;Bocayá&quot; and &quot;Bolívar&quot;, under the command of former privateer and Jean Lafitte associate Renato Beluche. The British assigned the brig-sloop to the region after the &quot;William Henry&quot; incident.

On January 23, 1824, de la Torre implemented anti-piracy measures in response to Spanish losses and political pressure from the United States, ordering that pirates be tried in a military tribunal with the defendants considered enemy combatants. De la Torre ordered the pursuit of pirates, bandits, and those aiding them, issuing medals, certificates and bounties in gold and silver as rewards. Manuel Lamparo was captured on Puerto Rico&#x27;s east coast, and some of his crew joined Cofresí and other fugitives.

United States Secretary of the Navy Samuel L. Southard ordered David Porter to assign ships to the Mona Passage, and the commodore sent the schooner and the brigantine . The ships were to investigate the zone, gathering information at Saint Barthélemy and St. Thomas with the goal of destroying the base at Mona. Although Porter warned that the pirates were reportedly well-armed and -supplied, he said the crews would probably not find plunder at the base because of the proximity of eastern Puerto Rican ports. On February 8, 1824, the &quot;Spark&quot; arrived at Mona, conducted reconnaissance and landed. A suspicious schooner was seen, but captain John T. Newton decided not to chase her. The crew found a small settlement with an empty hut and other buildings, a chest of medicine, sails, books, an anchor and documents from &quot;William Henry&quot;. Newton ordered the base and a large canoe found in the vicinity destroyed, and reported his findings to the Secretary of the Navy. According to another report, the ship sent was the ; in this account, several pirates eluded the &quot;Beagle&quot;″s crew. Undeterred, Cofresí quickly resettled on Mona.

Attacks on two brigantines were reported by Renato Beluche on February 12, 1824, and published in &quot;El Colombiano&quot; several days later. The first was &quot;Boniton&quot;, captained by Alexander Murdock, which sailed with a load of cocoa from Trinidad and was intercepted en route to Gibraltar. The second, &quot;Bonne Sophie&quot;, sailed from Havre de Grace under the command of a man named Chevanche with dry goods bound for Martinique. In both cases, the sailors were beaten and imprisoned and the ships plundered. The ships were part of a convoy escorted by the &quot;Bolívar&quot; off Puerto Real, Cabo Rojo, and Cofresí captained a ship identified by Beluche as a &quot;pailebot&quot; (a small schooner). Although &quot;Bolívar&quot; could not capture her, her crew described the vessel as painted black, armed with a rotating cannon and having a crew of twenty unidentified Puerto Rican men. Cofresí was presumably leading the vessels to dock at Pedernales, where Mendoza and his brother could facilitate the distribution of loot with the aid of official inertia. From there, other associates usually used Boquerón Bay for transportation and ensured that the loot reached stores in Cabo Rojo and nearby towns.

In this region Cofresí&#x27;s influence extended to government and the military, with the Ramírez de Arellano family involved in the smuggling and sale of his loot. On land the loot, hidden in sacks and barrels, was brought to Mayagüez, Hormigueros or San Germán for distribution. When Beluche returned to Colombia, he published an article critical of the situation in the press. &quot;La Gaceta de Puerto Rico&quot; countered, accusing him of stealing &quot;Bonne Sophie&quot; and connecting him to the pirates.

On February 16, 1824, de la Torre mandated a more aggressive pursuit and prosecution of pirates. In March the governor ordered a search for the schooner &quot;Caballo Blanco&quot;, reportedly used in the boarding of &quot;Boniton&quot; and &quot;Bonne Sophie&quot; and similar attacks. In private communication with Mayagüez military commander José Rivas, he asked Rivas to find someone trustworthy who could launch a mission to capture &quot;the so-called Cofresin&quot; and to notify him personally of the pirate&#x27;s arrest. Authorizing the use of force, the governor described Cofresí as &quot;one of the evil ones that I am pursuing&quot; and acknowledged that the pirate was protected by Cabo Rojo authorities. The mayor was unable (or unwilling) to cooperate, despite orders from de la Torre. Rivas tracked Cofresí to his house twice, but found it empty. When the captain lost contact with the pirate and his wife, he was also unable to communicate with the mayor. A similar search was undertaken in San Germán, whose mayor reported to de la Torre on March 12, 1824.

Martinique governor François-Xavier Donzelot wrote to de la Torre on March 22, concerned about the capture of &quot;Bonne Sophie&quot; and the impact of piracy on maritime commerce. This brought France into the search for Cofresí; on March 23 de la Torre authorized France to patrol the Puerto Rican coast and commissioned a frigate, &quot;Flora&quot;. The mission was led by a military commander named Mallet, who was ordered to the west coast and pursue the pirates &quot;until he [was] able to trap and destroy them&quot;. Although &quot;Flora&quot; arrived three days after the operation&#x27;s approval, the attempt was unsuccessful. Rivas then assigned Joaquín Arroyo, a retired Pedernales militiaman, to monitor activity near Cofresí&#x27;s house. 

In April 1824, Rincón mayor Pedro García authorized the sale of a vessel owned by Juan Bautista de Salas to Pedro Ramírez. Ramírez, who may have been a member of the Ramírez de Arellano family, lived in Pedernales and was a neighbor of Cofresí&#x27;s brothers and Cristobal Pabón Davila. On April 30, shortly after acquiring the ship, Ramírez sold it to Cofresí (who used it as a pirate flagship). The irregularity of the transactions was quickly noticed, prompting an investigation of García. The scandal weakened his already-frail authority, and Matías Conchuela intervened as the governor&#x27;s representative. De la Torre asked the mayor of Añasco, Thomás de la Concha, to retrieve the records and verify their accuracy. The investigation, led by public prosecutor José Madrazo of the Regimiento de Granada&#x27;s Military Anti-Piracy Commission, concluded with Bautista&#x27;s imprisonment and sanctions for García. Several members of the Ramírez de Arellano family were prosecuted, including the former mayors of Añasco and Mayagüez (Manuel and José María), Tómas and Antonio. Others with the same last name but unclear parentage, such as Juan Lorenzo Ramirez, were also linked to Cofresí.

A number of unsuccessful searches were carried out in Cabo Rojo by an urban militia led by Captain Carlos de Espada, and additional searches were made in San Germán. On May 23, 1824, the Mayagüez military commander prepared two vessels and sent them to Pedernales in response to reported sightings of Cofresí. Rivas and the military captain of Mayagüez, Cayetano Castillo y Picado, boarded a ship commanded by Sergeant Sebastián Bausá. Sailor Pedro Alacán, best known as the grandfather of Ramón Emeterio Betances and a neighbor of Cofresí, was captain of the second schooner. The expedition failed, only finding a military deserter named Manuel Fernández de Córdova. Also known as Manuel Navarro, Fernández was connected to Cofresí through Lucas Branstan (a merchant from Trieste who was involved in &quot;Bonne Sophie&quot; incident). In the meantime, the pirates fled toward southern Puerto Rico. Poorly supplied after his hasty retreat, Cofresí docked at Jobos Bay on June 2, 1824; about a dozen pirates invaded the hacienda of Francisco Antonio Ortiz, stealing his cattle. The group then broke into a second estate, owned by Jacinto Texidor, stole plantains and resupplied their ship. It is now believed that Juan José Mateu gave the pirates refuge in one of his haciendas, near Jobos Bay. The next day the news reached Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes, who quickly contacted the military and requested operations by land and sea. He was told that there were not enough weapons in the municipality for a mission of that scale. Brenes then requested supplies from Patillas, which rushed him twenty guns.

However, the pirates fled the municipality and traveled west. On June 9, 1824, Cofresí led an assault on the schooner &quot;San José y Las Animas&quot; off the coast of Tallaboa in Peñuelas. The ship was en route between Saint Thomas and Guayanilla with over 6,000 pesos&#x27; worth of dry goods for Félix and Miguel Mattei, who were aboard. The Mattei brothers are now thought to have been anti-establishment smugglers related to Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein and the Ducoudray Holstein Expedition. The schooner, owned by Santos Lucca, sailed with captain Francisco Ocasio and a crew of four. Frequently used to transport cargo throughout the southern region and Saint Thomas, she made several trips to Cabo Rojo. When Cofresí began the chase, Ocasio headed landward; the brothers abandoned ship and swam ashore, from where they watched the ship&#x27;s plundering. Portugués was second-in-command during the boarding of &quot;San José y las Animas&quot;, and Joaquín &quot;El Campechano&quot; Hernández was a crew member. The pirates took most of the merchandise, leaving goods valued at 418 pesos, three reales and 26 maravedi. Governor Miguel de la Torre was visiting nearby municipalities at the time, which occupied the authorities. Cargo from &quot;San José y Las Animas&quot; (clothing belonging to the brothers and a painting) was later found at Cabo Rojo. Days later, a sloop and a small boat commanded by Luis Sánchez and Francisco Guilfuchi left Guayama in search of Cofresí. Unable to find him, they returned on June 19, 1824. Patillas and Guayama enacted measures, monitored by the governor, which were intended to prevent further visits.

De la Torre continued his tour of the municipalities, ordering Rivas to focus on the Cabo Rojo area when he reached Mayagüez. The task was given to Lieutenant Antonio Madrona, leader of the Mayagüez garrison. Madrona assembled troops and left for Cabo Rojo, launching an operation on June 17 which ended with the arrest of pirate Eustaquio Ventura de Luciano at the home of Juan Francisco. The troops came close to capturing a second associate, Joaquín &quot;El Maracaybero&quot; Gómez. Madrona then began a surprise attack at Pedernales, finding Cofresí and several associates (including Juan Bey, his brother Ignacio and his brother-in-law Juan Francisco Creitoff). The pirates&#x27; only option was to flee on foot. The Cofresí brothers escaped, but Creitoff and Bey were captured and tried in San Germán. Troops later visited Creitoff&#x27;s house, where they found Cofresí&#x27;s wife and mother-in-law. Under questioning, the women confirmed the brothers&#x27; identities. The authorities continued searching the homes of those involved and those of their families, where they found quantities of plunder hidden and prepared for sale. Madrona also found burned loot on a nearby hill. Juan Francisco Cofresí, Ventura de Luciano and Creitoff were sent to San Juan with other suspected associates. Of this group the pirate&#x27;s brother, Luis de Río and Juan Bautista Buyé were prosecuted as accomplices instead of pirates. Ignacio was later arrested and also charged as an accomplice. The Mattei brothers filed a claim against shopkeeper Francisco Betances that some of his merchandise was cargo from &quot;San José y Las Animas&quot;.

In response to a tip, José Mendoza and Rivas organized an expedition to Mona. On June 22, 1824, Pedro Alacán assembled a party of eight volunteers (among them Joaquín Arroyo, possibly Mendoza&#x27;s source). He loaned a small sailboat he co-owned (&quot;Avispa&quot;, once used by Cofresí&#x27;s brothers) to José Pérez Mendoza and Antonio Gueyh. There were eight volunteers, The locally coordinated operation intended to ambush and apprehend Cofresí in his hideout. The expedition left the coast of Cabo Rojo with Action Stations in place. Despite unfavorable sea conditions, the party arrived at their destination. However, as soon as they disembarked &quot;Avispa&quot; was lost. Although most of the pirates were captured without incident, Cofresí&#x27;s second in-command Juan Portugués was shot to death in the back and dismembered by crewmember Lorenzo Camareno. Among the captives was a man identified as José Rodríguez, but Cofresí was not with his crew. Five days later, they returned to Cabo Rojo on a ship confiscated from the pirates with weapons, three prisoners and Portugués&#x27; head and right hand (probably for identification when claiming the bounty). Rivas contacted de la Torre, informing him of further measures to track the pirates. The governor publicized the expedition, writing an account which was published in the government newspaper &quot;La Gaceta del Gobierno de Puerto Rico&quot; on July 9, 1824. Alacán was honored by the Spanish government, receiving the ship recovered from the pirates as compensation for the loss of the &quot;Avispa&quot;. Mendoza and the crew were also honored. Cofresí reportedly escaped in one of his ships with &quot;Campechano&quot; Hernández, resuming his attacks soon after the ambush.

Shortly after the Mona expedition, Ponce mayor José Ortíz de la Renta began his own search for Cofresí. On June 30, 1824, the schooner &quot;Unión&quot; left with 42 sailors commanded by captain Francisco Francheschi. After three days, the search was abandoned and the ship returned to Ponce. The governor enacted more measures to capture the pirates, including the commission of gunboats. De la Torre ordered the destruction of any hut or abandoned ship which might aid Cofresí in his escape attempts, an initiative carried out on the coasts of several municipalities. Again acting on the basis of information obtained by interrogation, the authorities tracked the pirates during the first week of July. Although José &quot;Pepe&quot; Cartagena (a local mulatto) and Juan Geraldo Bey were found in Cabo Rojo and San Germán respectively, Cofresí avoided the troops. On July 6, 1824, Cartagena resisted arrest and was killed in a shootout, with the developments again featured in &quot;La Gaceta del Gobierno de Puerto Rico&quot;. During the next few weeks, a joint initiative by Rivas and the west coast mayors led to the arrest of Cofresí associates Gregorio del Rosario, Miguel Hernández, Felipe Carnero, José Rodríguez, Gómez, Roberto Francisco Reifles, Sebastián Gallardo, Francisco Ramos, José Vicente and a slave of Juan Nicolás Bey (Juan Geraldo&#x27;s father) known as Pablo. However, the pirate again evaded the net. In his confession, Pablo testified that Juan Geraldo Bey was an accomplice of Cofresí. Sebastián Gallardo was captured on July 13, 1824, and tried as a collaborator. The defendants were transported to San Juan, where they were prosecuted by Madrazo in a military tribunal overseen by the governor. The trial was plagued by irregularities, including Gómez&#x27; allegation that the public attorney had accepted a bribe of 300 pesos from Juan Francisco.

During the searches, the pirates stole a &quot;sturdy, copper-plated boat&quot; from Cabo Rojo and escaped. The ship was originally stolen in San Juan by Gregorio Pereza and Francisco Pérez (both arrested during the search for &quot;Caballo Blanco&quot;) and given to Cofresí. When the news became public, mayor José María Hurtado asked local residents for help. On August 5, 1824, Antonio de Irizarry found the boat at Punta Arenas, a cape in the Joyuda barrio. The mayor quickly organized his troops, reaching the location on horseback. Aboard the ship they found three rifles, three guns, a carbine, a cannon, ammunition and supplies. After an unsuccessful search of nearby woods, the mayor sailed the craft to Pedernales and turned it over to Mendoza. A group left behind continued the search, but did not find anyone. Assuming that the pirates had fled inland, Hurtado alerted his colleagues in the region about the find. The mayor resumed the search, but abandoned it due to a rainstorm and poor directions. Peraza, Pérez, José Rivas del Mar, José María Correa and José Antonio Martinez were later arrested, but Cofresí remained free.

On August 5, 1824, the pirate and a skeleton crew captured the sloop &quot;María&quot; off the coast of Guayama as she completed a run between Guayanilla and Ponce under the command of Juan Camino. After boarding the ship they decided not to plunder her, since a larger craft was sailing towards them. The pirates fled west, intercepting a second sloop (&quot;La Voladora&quot;) off Morillos. Cofresí did not plunder her either, instead requesting information from captain Rafael Mola. That month a ship commanded by the pirates stalked the port of Fajardo, taking advantage of the lack of gunboats capable of pursuing their shallow-draft vessels. Shortly afterwards, the United States ordered captain Charles Boarman of the USS &quot;Weasel&quot; to monitor the western waters of Puerto Rico as part of an international force. The schooner located a sloop commanded by the pirates off Culebra, but it fled to Vieques and ran inland into dense vegetation; Boarman could only recover the ship.

The Danish sloop &quot;Jordenxiold&quot; was intercepted off Isla Palominos on September 3, 1824, as she completed a voyage from Saint Thomas to Fajardo; the pirates stole goods and cash from the passengers. The incident attracted the attention of the Danish government, which commissioned the &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; (a 16-gun brigantine commanded by Michael Klariman) to monitor the areas off Vieques and Culebra. On September 8–9 a hurricane Nuestra Señora de la Monserrate, struck southern Puerto Rico and passed directly over the Mona Passage. Cofresí and his crew were caught in the storm, which drove their ship towards Hispaniola. According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, an expedition weeks later by Fajardo commander Ramón Aboy to search Vieques, Culebra and the Windward Islands for pirates was actually after Cofresí. The operation used the schooner &quot;Aurora&quot; (owned by Nicolás Márquez) and &quot;Flor de Mayo&quot;, owned by José María Marujo. After weeks of searching, the team failed to locate anything of interest.

Continuing to drift, Cofresí and his crew were captured after his ship reached Santo Domingo. Sentenced to six years in prison, they were sent to a keep named Torre del Homenaje. Cofresí and his men escaped, were recaptured and again imprisoned. The group escaped again, breaking the locks on their cell doors and climbing down the prison walls on a stormy night on a rope made from their clothing. With Cofresí were two other inmates: a man known as Portalatín and Manuel Reyes Paz, former boatswain of &quot;El Scipión&quot;. After reaching the province of San Pedro de Macorís, the pirates bought a ship. They sailed from Hispaniola in late September to Naguabo, where Portalatín disembarked. From there they went to the island of Vieques, where they set up another hideout and regrouped.

===Challenge to the West Indies Squadron===
By October 1824 piracy in the region was dramatically reduced, with Cofresí the remaining target of concern. However, that month Peraza, Pérez, Hernández, Gallardo, José Rodríguez and Ramos escaped from jail. Three former members of Lamparo&#x27;s crew—a man of African descent named Bibián Hernández Morales, Antonio del Castillo and Juan Manuel de Fuentes Rodríguez—also broke out. They were joined by Juan Manuel &quot;Venado&quot; de Fuentes Rodríguez, Ignacio Cabrera, Miguel de la Cruz, Damasio Arroyo, Miguel &quot;El Rasgado&quot; de la Rosa and Juan Reyes. Those traveling east met with Cofresí, who welcomed them on his crew; the pirate was in Naguabo looking for recruits after his return from Hispaniola. Hernández Morales, an experienced knife fighter, was second-in-command of the new crew. At the height of their success, they had a flotilla of three sloops and a schooner. The group avoided capture by hiding in Ceiba, Fajardo, Naguabo, Jobos Bay and Vieques, and when Cofresí sailed the east coast he reportedly flew the flag of Gran Colombia.

On October 24, Hernández Morales led a group of six pirates in the robbery of Cabot, Bailey &amp; Company in Saint Thomas, making off with US$5,000. On October 26 the USS &quot;Beagle&quot;, commanded by Charles T. Platt, navigated by John Low and carrying shopkeeper George Bedford (with a list of plundered goods, which were reportedly near Naguabo) left Saint Thomas. Platt sailed to Vieques, following a tip about a pirate sloop. &quot;Beagle&quot; opened fire, interrupting the capture of a sloop from Saint Croix, but the pirates docked at Punta Arenas in Vieques and fled inland; one, identified as Juan Felis, was captured after a shootout. When Platt disembarked in Fajardo to contact Juan Campos, a local associate of Bedford, the authorities accused him of piracy and detained him. The officer was later freed, but the pirates escaped. Commodore Porter&#x27;s reaction to what was later known as the Fajardo Affair led to a diplomatic crisis which threatened war between Spain and the United States; Campos was later found to be involved in the distribution of loot.

With more ships, Cofresí&#x27;s activity near Culebra and Vieques peaked by November 1824. The international force reacted by sending more warships to patrol the zone; France provided the &quot;Gazelle&quot;, a brigantine, and the frigate &quot;Constancia&quot;. After the Fajardo incident the United States increased its flotilla in the region, with the USS &quot;Beagle&quot; joined by the schooners and in addition to the previously commissioned &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; and &quot;Scout&quot;. Despite unprecedented monitoring, Cofresí grew bolder. John D. Sloat, captain of &quot;Grampus&quot;, received intelligence placing the pirates in a schooner out of Cabo Rojo. On the evening of January 25, 1825, Cofresí sailed a sloop towards &quot;Grampus&quot;, which was patrolling the west coast. In position, the pirate commanded his crew (armed with sabers and muskets) to open fire and ordered the schooner to stop. When Sloat gave the order to counterattack, Cofresí sailed into the night. Although a skiff and cutters from &quot;Grampus&quot; were sent after the pirates, they failed to find them after a two-hour search.

The pirates sailed east and docked at Quebrada de las Palmas, a river in Naguabo. From there, Cofresí, Hernández Morales, Juan Francisco &quot;Ceniza&quot; Pizarro and De los Reyes crossed the mangroves and vegetation to the Quebrada barrio in Fajardo.
 Joined by a fugitive, Juan Pedro Espinoza, the group robbed the house of Juan Becerril and hid in a house in the nearby Río Abajo barrio. Two days later Cofresí again led his flotilla out to sea and targeted &quot;San Vicente&quot;, a Spanish sloop making its way back from Saint Thomas. Cofresí attacked with two sloops, ordering his crew to fire muskets and blunderbusses. Sustaining heavy damage, &quot;San Vicente&quot; finally escaped because she was near port.

On February 10, 1825, Cofresí plundered the sloop &quot;Neptune&quot;. The merchant ship, with a cargo of fabric and provisions, was attacked while its dry goods were unloaded at dockside in Jobos Bay. &quot;Neptune&quot; was owned by Salvador Pastoriza, who was supervising the unloading. Cofresí began the charge in a sloop, opening musket fire on the crew, and Pastoriza fled in a rowboat. Despite a bullet wound, Pastoriza identified four of the eight to ten pirates (including Cofresí). An Italian living in Puerto Rico, Pedro Salovi, was reportedly second-in-command during the attack. The pirates pursued and shot those who fled. Cofresí sailed &quot;Neptune&quot; out of Jobos Port, a harbor in Jobos Bay (near Fajardo), and adopted the sloop as a pirate ship.

Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes doubled his patrol. Salovi was soon arrested, and informed on his shipmates. Hernández Morales led another sloop, intercepting &quot;Beagle&quot; off Vieques. After a battle, the pirate sloop was captured and Hernández Morales was transported to St. Thomas for trial. After being sentenced to death, he escaped from prison and disappeared for years. According to a St. Thomas resident, on February 12, 1825, the pirates retaliated by setting fire to a town on the island. That week, &quot;Neptune&quot; captured a Danish schooner belonging to W. Furniss (a company based in Saint Thomas) off the Ponce coast with a load of imported merchandise. After the assault, Cofresí and his crew abandoned the ship at sea. Later seen floating with broken masts, it was presumed lost. Some time later Cofresí and his crew boarded another ship owned by the company near Guayama, again plundering and abandoning her. Like its predecessor, it was seen near Caja de Muertos (Dead Man&#x27;s Chest) before disappearing.

Evading &quot;Beagle&quot;, Cofresí returned to Jobos Bay; on February 15, 1825, the pirates arrived in Fajardo. Three days later John Low picked up a six-gun sloop, &quot;Anne&quot; (commonly known by her Spanish name &quot;Ana&quot; or &quot;La Ana&quot;), which he had ordered from boatbuilder Toribio Centeno and registered in St. Thomas. Centeno sailed the sloop to Fajardo, where he received permission to dock at Quebrada de Palmas in Naguabo. As its new owner Low accompanied him, remaining aboard while cargo was loaded. That night Cofresí led a group of eight pirates, stealthily boarded the ship and forced the crew to jump overboard; during the capture, Cofresí reportedly picked $20 from Low&#x27;s pocket. Despite having to &quot;walk the plank&quot;, Low&#x27;s crew survived and reported the assault to the governor of Saint Thomas. Low probably attracted the pirates&#x27; attention by docking near one of their hideouts; his work on the &quot;Beagle&quot; rankled, and they were hungry for revenge after the capture of Hernández Morales. Low met Centeno at his hacienda, where he told the Spaniard about the incident and later filed a formal complaint in Fajardo. Afterwards, he and his crew sailed to Saint Thomas. Although another account suggests that Cofresí bought &quot;Anne&quot; from Centeno for twice Low&#x27;s price, legal documents verify that the builder was paid by Low. Days later, Cofresí led his pirates to the Humacao shipyard and they stole a cannon from a gunboat (ordered by Miguel de la Torre to pursue the pirates) which was under construction. The crew armed themselves with weapons found on the ships they boarded.

After the hijacking, Cofresí adopted &quot;Anne&quot; as his flagship. Although she is popularly believed to have been renamed &quot;El Mosquito&quot;, all official documents use her formal name. &quot;Anne&quot; was quickly used to intercept a merchant off the coast of Vieques who was completing a voyage from Saint Croix to Puerto Rico. Like others before it, the fate of the captured ship and its crew is unknown. The Spanish countered with an expedition from the port of Patillas. Captain Sebastián Quevedo commanded a small boat, &quot;Esperanza&quot;, to find the pirates but was unsuccessful after several days at sea. At the same time, de la Torre pressured the regional military commanders to take action against the pirates and undercover agents monitored maritime traffic in most coastal towns. The pirates docked &quot;Anne&quot; in Jobos Bay before sunset, a pattern reported by the local militia to southern region commander Tomás de Renovales. At this time the pirates sailed &quot;Anne&quot; towards Peñuelas, where the ship was recognized. Cofresí&#x27;s last capture was on March 5, 1825, when he commanded the hijacking of a boat owned by Vicente Antoneti in Salinas.

==Capture and trial==
By the spring of 1825, the flotilla led by &quot;Anne&quot; was the last substantial pirate threat in the Caribbean. The incursion which finally ended Cofresí&#x27;s operation began serendipitously. When Low arrived at his home base in Saint Thomas with news of &quot;Anne&quot;″s hijacking, a Puerto Rican ship reported a recent sighting. Sloat requested three international sloops (with Spanish and Danish papers) from the Danish governor, collaborating with Pastoriza and Pierety. All four of Cofresí&#x27;s victims left port shortly after the authorization on March 4; the task force was made up of &quot;Grampus&quot;, &quot;San José y Las Animas&quot;, an unidentified vessel belonging to Pierety and a third sloop staffed by volunteers from a Colombian frigate. After sighting &quot;Anne&quot; while they negotiated the involvement of the Spanish government in Puerto Rico, the task force decided to split up.

&quot;San José y Las Animas&quot; found Cofresí the next day, and mounted a surprise attack. The sailors aboard hid while Cofresí, recognizing the ship as a local merchant vessel, gave the order to attack it. When &quot;Anne&quot; was within range, the crew of &quot;San José y las Animas&quot; opened fire. Startled, the pirates countered with cannon and musket fire while attempting to outrun the sloop. Unable to shake off &quot;San José y las Animas&quot; and having lost two members of his crew, Cofresí grounded &quot;Anne&quot; and fled inland. Although a third pirate fell during the landing, most scattered throughout rural Guayama and adjacent areas. Cofresí, injured, was accompanied by two crew members. Half his crew was captured shortly afterwards, but the captain remained at large until the following day. At midnight a local trooper, Juan Cándido Garay, and two other members of the Puerto Rican militia spotted Cofresí. The trio ambushed the pirate, who was hit by blunderbuss fire while he was fleeing. Despite his injury, Cofresí fought back with a knife until he was subdued by militia machetes.

After their capture, the pirates were held at a prison in Guayama before their transfer to San Juan. Cofresí met with mayor Francisco Brenes, offering him 4,000 pieces of eight (which he claimed to possess) in exchange for his freedom. Although a key component of modern myth, this is the only historical reference to Cofresí&#x27;s hiding any treasure. Brenes declined the bribe. Cofresí and his crew remained in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan for the rest of their lives. On March 21, 1825, the pirate&#x27;s reputed servant (known only as Carlos) was arrested in Guayama.

===Military prosecution===
Cofresí received a council of war trial, with no possibility of a civil trial. The only right granted the pirates was to choose their lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was a formality. José Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried—an oddity, since other cases as serious (or more so) sometimes took months or years. Cofresí was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought that the reason for the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter&#x27;s court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofresí trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required by trial protocol). The trial was based on the pirates&#x27; confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established.

The other pirates on trial were Manuel Aponte Monteverde of Añasco; Vicente del Valle Carbajal of Punta Espada (or Santo Domingo, depending on the report); Vicente Ximénes of Cumaná; Antonio Delgado of Humacao; Victoriano Saldaña of Juncos; Agustín de Soto of San Germán; Carlos Díaz of Trinidad de Barlovento; Carlos Torres of Fajardo; Juan Manuel Fuentes of Havana, and José Rodríguez of Curaçao. Torres stood out as an African and Cofresí&#x27;s slave. Among the few sentenced for piracy who were not executed, his sentence was to be sold at public auction with his price earmarked for trial costs. Cofresí confessed to capturing a French sloop in Vieques; a Danish schooner; a sailing ship from St. Thomas; a brigantine and a schooner from eastern Hispaniola; a sloop with a load of cattle in Boca del Infierno; a ship from which he stole 800 pieces of eight in Patillas, and an American schooner with a cargo worth 8,000 pieces of eight (abandoned and burned in Punta de Peñones).

Under pressure, he was adamant that he was unaware of the current whereabouts of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles&#x27; &quot;Weekly Register&quot; Cofresí admitted off the record that he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants&#x27; social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates.

==Death and legacy==
On the morning of March 29, 1825, a firing squad was assembled to carry out the sentence handed down to the pirates. The public execution, which had a large number of spectators, was supervised by the Regimiento de Infantería de Granada between eight and nine a.m. Catholic priests were present to hear confessions and offer comfort. As the pirates prayed, they were shot before the silent crowd. Although San Felipe del Morro is the accepted execution site, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (whose father was a member of the Regimiento de Granada) places their execution near Convento Dominico in the Baluarte de Santo Domingo (part of present-day Old San Juan). According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, in a final act of defiance Cofresí refused to have his eyes covered after he was tied to a chair and he was blindfolded by soldiers. As per author Richard Wheeler, the pirate said that after killing three or four hundred people, it would be strange if he was not accustomed to death. Another claim attributed to Cofresí&#x27;s valediction is that he had &quot;killed four hundred persons with his own hands, but never to his knowledge had he killed a native of Puerto Rico.&quot; Cofresí&#x27;s last words were reportedly, &quot;I have killed hundreds with my own hands, and I know how to die. Fire!&quot;
According to several of the pirates&#x27; death certificates, they were buried on the shore next to the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery. Hernández Morales and several of his associates received the same treatment. Cofresí and his men were buried behind the cemetery, on what is now a lush green hill overlooking the cemetery wall. Contrary to local lore, they were not buried in Old San Juan Cemetery (Cementerio Antiguo de San Juan); their execution as criminals made them ineligible for burial in the Catholic cemetery. A letter from Sloat to United States Secretary of the Navy Samuel L. Southard implied that at least some of the pirates were intended to be &quot;beheaded and quartered, and their parts sent to all the small ports around the island to be exhibited&quot;. Spanish authorities continued to arrest Cofresí associates until 1839.

At this time defendants were required to pay trial expenses, and Cofresí&#x27;s family was charged 643 pieces of eight, two reales and 12 maravedí. Contemporary documents suggest that Juana Creitoff, with little or no support from Cofresí&#x27;s brothers and sisters, was left with the debt. His brothers distanced themselves from the trial and their brother&#x27;s legacy, and Juan Francisco left Cabo Rojo for Humacao. Juan Ignacio also evidently disassociated himself from Creitoff and her daughter, and one of Juan Ignacio&#x27;s granddaughters ignored Bernardina and her descendants. Due to Cofresí&#x27;s squandering of his treasure, his only asset the Spanish government could seize was Carlos. Appraised at 200 pesos, he was sold to Juan Saint Just for 133 pesos. After the auction costs were paid, only 108 pesos and 2 reales were left; the remainder was paid by Félix and Miguel Mattei after they made a deal with the authorities giving them the cargo of the &quot;San José y las Animas&quot; in return for future accountability. Juana Creitoff died a year later.

Bernardina later married a Venezuelan immigrant, Estanislao Asencio Velázquez, continuing Cofresí&#x27;s blood lineage in Cabo Rojo to this day. She had seven children: José Lucas, María Esterlina, Antonio Salvador, Antonio Luciano, Pablo, María Encarnación and Juan Bernardino. One of Cofresí&#x27;s most notable descendants was Ana González, better known by her married name Ana G. Méndez. Cofresí&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Méndez was directly descended from the Cabo Rojo bloodline through her mother Ana González Cofresí. Known for her interest in education, she was the first member of her branch of the Cofresí family to earn a high-school diploma and university degree. A teacher, Méndez founded the Puerto Rico High School of Commerce during the 1940s (when most women did not complete their education). By the turn of the 21st century her initiative had evolved into the Ana G. Méndez University System, the largest group of private universities in Puerto Rico. Other branches of the Cofresí family include Juan Francisco&#x27;s descendants in Ponce, and Juan Ignacio&#x27;s lineage persists in the western region. Internationally, the Kupferschein family remains in Trieste. Another family member was Severo Colberg Ramírez, speaker of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico during the 1980s. Colberg made efforts to popularize Cofresí, particularly the heroic legends which followed his death. He was related to the pirate through his sister Juana, who married Germán Colberg.

After Cofresí&#x27;s death, items associated with him have been preserved or placed on display. His birth certificate is at San Miguel Arcángel Church with those of other notable figures, including Ramón Emeterio Betances and Salvador Brau. Earrings said to have been worn by Cofresí were owned by Ynocencia Ramírez de Arellano, a maternal cousin. Her great-great-grandson, collector Teodoro Vidal, gave them to the National Museum of American History in 1997 and the institution displayed them in a section devoted to Spanish colonial history. Locally, documents are preserved in the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture&#x27;s General Archive of Puerto Rico, the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, the University of Puerto Rico&#x27;s General Library and Historic Investigation Department and the Catholic Church&#x27;s Parochial Archives. Outside Puerto Rico, records can be found at the National Archives Building and the General Archive of the Indies. However, official documents relating to Cofresí&#x27;s trial and execution have been lost.

==Modern view==

Few aspects of Cofresí&#x27;s life and relationships have avoided the romanticism surrounding pirates in popular culture. During his life, attempts by Spanish authorities to portray him as a menacing figure by emphasizing his role as &quot;pirate lord&quot; and nicknaming him the &quot;terror of the seas&quot; planted him in the collective consciousness. This, combined with his boldness, transformed Cofresí into a swashbuckler differing from late-19th-century fictional accounts of pirates. The legends are inconsistent in their depiction of historical facts, often contradicting each other. Cofresí&#x27;s race, economic background, personality and loyalties are among variable aspects of these stories. However, the widespread use of these myths in the media has resulted in their general acceptance as fact.

The myths and legends surrounding Cofresí fall into two categories: those portraying him as a generous thief or anti-hero and those describing him as overwhelmingly evil. A subcategory represents him as an adventurer, world traveler or womanizer. Reports by historians such as Tió of the pirate sharing his loot with the needy have evolved into a detailed mythology. These apologetics attempt to justify his piracy, blaming it on poverty, revenge or a desire to restore his family&#x27;s honor, and portray Cofresí as a class hero defying official inequality and corruption. He is said to have been a protector and benefactor of children, women and the elderly, with some accounts describing him as a rebel hero and supporter of independence from imperial power.

Legends describing Cofresí as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements acquired through witchcraft, mysticism or a deal with the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofresí&#x27;s ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofresí has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; those trying to find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones&#x27; Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofresí or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden treasure flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.
The 20th century revived interest in Cofresí&#x27;s piracy as a tourist attraction, with municipalities in Puerto Rico highlighting their historical connection to the pirates. By the second half of the century, beaches and sports teams (especially in his native Cabo Rojo, which features a monument in his honor) were named for him; in the Dominican Republic, a resort town was named after the pirate. Cofresí&#x27;s name has been commercialized, with a number of products and businesses adopting it and its associated legends. Puerto Rico&#x27;s first flag carrier seaplane was named for him. Several attempts have been made to portray Cofresí&#x27;s life on film, based on legend.

Coplas, songs and plays have been adapted from the oral tradition, and formal studies of the historical Cofresí and the legends surrounding him have appeared in book form. Historians Cardona Bonet, Acosta, Salvador Brau, Ramón Ibern Fleytas, Antonio S. Pedreira, Bienvenido Camacho, Isabel Cuchí Coll, Fernando Géigel Sabat, Ramírez Brau and Cayetano Coll y Toste have published the results of their research. Others inspired by the pirate include poets Cesáreo Rosa Nieves and the brothers Luis and Gustavo Palés Matos. Educators Juan Bernardo Huyke and Robert Fernández Valledor have also published on Cofresí. In mainstream media Cofresí has recently been discussed in the newspapers &quot;El Mundo&quot;, &quot;El Imparcial&quot;, &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot;, &quot;Primera Hora&quot;, &quot;El Periódico de Catalunya&quot;, &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;, &quot;Tribuna do Norte&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and the magazines &quot;Puerto Rico Ilustrado&quot;, &quot;Fiat Lux&quot; and &quot;Proceedings&quot; have published articles on the pirate.

<text>Julian Seymour Schwinger (; February 12, 1918 – July 16, 1994) was a Nobel Prize-winning American theoretical physicist. He is best known for his work on quantum electrodynamics (QED), in particular for developing a relativistically invariant perturbation theory, and for renormalizing QED to one loop order. Schwinger was a physics professor at several universities.

Schwinger is recognized as an important physicist, responsible for much of modern quantum field theory, including a variational approach, and the equations of motion for quantum fields. He developed the first electroweak model, and the first example of confinement in 1+1 dimensions. He is responsible for the theory of multiple neutrinos, Schwinger terms, and the theory of the spin-3/2 field.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Julian Seymour Schwinger was born in New York City, to Ashkenazi Jewish parents, Belle (née Rosenfeld) and Benjamin Schwinger, a garment manufacturer, who had emigrated from Poland to the United States. Both his father and his mother&#x27;s parents were prosperous clothing manufacturers, although the family business declined after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The family followed the Orthodox Jewish tradition. Julian&#x27;s older brother Harold Schwinger was born in 1911, seven years before Julian who was born in 1918.

Schwinger was a precocious student. He attended the Townsend Harris High School from 1932 to 1934, a highly regarded high school for gifted students at the time. During high school, Julian had already started reading &quot;Physical Review&quot; papers by authors such as Paul Dirac in the library of the City College of New York, in whose campus Townsend Harris was then located.

In the fall of 1934, Schwinger entered the City College of New York as an undergraduate. CCNY automatically accepted all Townsend Harris graduates at the time, and both institutions offered free tuition. Due to his intense interest in physics and mathematics, Julian performed very well in those subjects despite often skipping classes and learning directly from books. On the other hand, his lack of interest for other topics such as English led to academic conflicts with teachers of those subjects.

After Julian had joined CCNY, his brother Harold, who had previously graduated from CCNY, asked his ex-classmate Lloyd Motz to &quot;get to know [Julian]&quot;. Lloyd was a CCNY physics instructor and Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University at the time. Lloyd made the acquaintance, and soon recognized Julian&#x27;s talent. Noticing Schwinger&#x27;s academic problems, Lloyd decided to ask Isidor Isaac Rabi who he knew at Columbia for help. Rabi also immediately recognized Schwinger&#x27;s capabilities on their first meeting, and then made arrangements to award Schwinger with a scholarship to study at Columbia. At first Julian&#x27;s bad grades in some subjects at CCNY prevented the scholarship award. But Rabi persisted and showed an unpublished paper on quantum electrodynamics written by Schwinger to Hans Bethe, who happened to be passing by New York. Bethe&#x27;s approval of the paper and his reputation in that domain were then enough to secure the scholarship for Julian, who then transferred to Columbia. His academic situation at Columbia was much better than at CCNY. He was accepted into the Phi Beta Kappa society and received his B.A. in 1936.

During Schwinger&#x27;s graduate studies, Rabi felt that it would be good for Julian to visit other institutions around the country, and Julian was awarded a travelling fellowship for the year 37/38 which he spent at working with Gregory Breit and Eugene Wigner. During this time, Schwinger, who previously had already had the habit of working until late at night, went further and made the day/night switch more complete, working at night and sleeping during the day, a habit he would carry throughout his career. Schwinger later commented that this switch was in part a way to retain greater intellectual independence and avoid being &quot;dominated&quot; by Breit and Wigner by simply reducing the duration of contact with them by working different hours.

Schwinger obtained his PhD overseen by Rabi in 1939 at the age of 21.

During the fall of 1939 Schwinger started working at the University of California, Berkeley under J. Robert Oppenheimer, where he stayed for two years as an NRC fellow.

===Career===
After having worked with Oppenheimer, Schwinger&#x27;s first regular academic appointment was at Purdue University in 1941. While on leave from Purdue, he worked at the MIT Radiation Laboratory instead of at the Los Alamos National Laboratory during World War II. He provided theoretical support for the development of radar. After the war, Schwinger left Purdue for Harvard University, where he taught from 1945 to 1974. In 1966 he became the Eugene Higgins professor of physics at Harvard.

Schwinger developed an affinity for Green&#x27;s functions from his radar work, and he used these methods to formulate quantum field theory in terms of local Green&#x27;s functions in a relativistically invariant way. This allowed him to calculate unambiguously the first corrections to the electron magnetic moment in quantum electrodynamics. Earlier non-covariant work had arrived at infinite answers, but the extra symmetry in his methods allowed Schwinger to isolate the correct finite corrections.

Schwinger developed renormalization, formulating quantum electrodynamics unambiguously to one-loop order.

In the same era, he introduced non-perturbative methods into quantum field theory, by calculating the rate at which electron–positron pairs are created by tunneling in an electric field, a process now known as the &quot;Schwinger effect.&quot; This effect could not be seen in any finite order in perturbation theory.

Schwinger&#x27;s foundational work on quantum field theory constructed the modern framework of field correlation functions and their equations of motion. His approach started with a quantum action and allowed bosons and fermions to be treated equally for the first time, using a differential form of Grassman integration. He gave elegant proofs for the spin-statistics theorem and the CPT theorem, and noted that the field algebra led to anomalous Schwinger terms in various classical identities, because of short distance singularities. These were foundational results in field theory, instrumental for the proper understanding of anomalies.

In other notable early work, Rarita and Schwinger formulated the abstract Pauli and Fierz theory of the spin-3/2 field in a concrete form, as a vector of Dirac spinors, Rarita–Schwinger equation. In order for the spin-3/2 field to interact consistently, some form of supersymmetry is required, and Schwinger later regretted that he had not followed up on this work far enough to discover supersymmetry.

Schwinger discovered that neutrinos come in multiple varieties, one for the electron and one for the muon. Nowadays there are known to be three light neutrinos; the third is the partner of the tau lepton.

In the 1960s, Schwinger formulated and analyzed what is now known as the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in one space and one time dimension, the first example of a confining theory. He was also the first to suggest an electroweak gauge theory, an formula_1 gauge group spontaneously broken to electromagnetic formula_2 at long distances. This was extended by his student Sheldon Glashow into the accepted pattern of electroweak unification. He attempted to formulate a theory of quantum electrodynamics with point magnetic monopoles, a program which met with limited success because monopoles are strongly interacting when the quantum of charge is small.

Having supervised 73 doctoral dissertations, Schwinger is known as one of the most prolific graduate advisors in physics. Four of his students won Nobel prizes: Roy Glauber, Benjamin Roy Mottelson, Sheldon Glashow and Walter Kohn (in chemistry).

Schwinger had a mixed relationship with his colleagues, because he always pursued independent research, different from mainstream fashion. In particular, Schwinger developed the source theory, a phenomenological theory for the physics of elementary particles, which is a predecessor of the modern effective field theory. It treats quantum fields as long-distance phenomena and uses auxiliary &#x27;sources&#x27; that resemble currents in classical field theories. The source theory is a mathematically consistent field theory with clearly derived phenomenological results. The criticisms by his Harvard colleagues led Schwinger to leave the faculty in 1972 for UCLA. It is a story widely told that Steven Weinberg, who inherited Schwinger&#x27;s paneled office in Lyman Laboratory, there found a pair of old shoes, with the implied message, &quot;think you can fill these?&quot; Based on Schwinger&#x27;s source theory, Weinberg set the underpinnings of the effective field theory, that is more appreciated among physicists. In spite of the shoes incident, Weinberg gave the credit to Schwinger for the inspiration.

At UCLA, and for the rest of his career, Schwinger continued to develop the source theory and its various applications. After 1989 Schwinger took a keen interest in the non-mainstream research of cold fusion. He wrote eight theory papers about it. He resigned from the American Physical Society after their refusal to publish his papers. He felt that cold fusion research was being suppressed and academic freedom violated. He wrote, &quot;The pressure for conformity is enormous. I have experienced it in editors&#x27; rejection of submitted papers, based on venomous criticism of anonymous referees. The replacement of impartial reviewing by censorship will be the death of science.&quot;

In his last publications, Schwinger proposed a theory of sonoluminescence as a long-distance quantum radiative phenomenon associated not with atoms, but with fast-moving surfaces in the collapsing bubble, where there are discontinuities in the dielectric constant. The mechanism of sonoluminescence now supported by experiments focuses on superheated gas inside the bubble as the source of the light.

Schwinger was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for his work on quantum electrodynamics (QED), along with Richard Feynman and Shin&#x27;ichirō Tomonaga. Schwinger&#x27;s awards and honors were numerous even before his Nobel win. They include the first Albert Einstein Award (1951), the U.S. National Medal of Science (1964), honorary D.Sc. degrees from Purdue University (1961) and Harvard University (1962), and the Nature of Light Award of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1949). In 1987, Schwinger received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

===Schwinger and Feynman===
As a famous physicist, Schwinger was often compared to another legendary physicist of his generation, Richard Feynman. Schwinger was more formally inclined and favored symbolic manipulations in quantum field theory. He worked with local field operators, and found relations between them, and he felt that physicists should understand the algebra of local fields, no matter how paradoxical it was. By contrast, Feynman was more intuitive, believing that the physics could be extracted entirely from the Feynman diagrams, which gave a particle picture. Schwinger commented on Feynman diagrams in the following way,

Schwinger disliked Feynman diagrams because he felt that they made the student focus on the particles and forget about local fields, which in his view inhibited understanding. He went so far as to ban them altogether from his class, although he understood them perfectly well. The true difference is however deeper, and it was expressed by Schwinger in the following passage,

Despite sharing the Nobel Prize, Schwinger and Feynman had a different approach to quantum electrodynamics and to quantum field theory in general. Feynman used a regulator, while Schwinger was able to formally renormalize to one loop without an explicit regulator. Schwinger believed in the formalism of local fields, while Feynman had faith in the particle paths. They followed each other&#x27;s work closely, and each respected the other. On Feynman&#x27;s death, Schwinger described him as

===Death===

Schwinger died of pancreatic cancer. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery; formula_3, where formula_4 is the fine structure constant, is engraved above his name on his tombstone. These symbols refer to his calculation of the correction (&quot;anomalous&quot;) to the magnetic moment of the electron.

<text>In philately, a mixed [[franking]] is an occurrence of postage stamps of more than one country or issuing entity on a single cover, or the occurrence of postage stamps of more than one currency of a country or issuing identity on a single cover. Since nearly all countries of the world have agreed to deliver each other&#x27;s mail, it is unusual to need more than the stamps of the originating country; valid mixed frankings are uncommon and valued by collectors.

Before the advent of the Universal Postal Union in 1874, sending international mail was quite an adventure; it might be necessary to affix the stamps of the destination country in addition to those of the origin, and in the worst cases, possibly for several other countries along the way. Sometimes the letter was held until the recipient brought stamps, they were affixed and cancelled, and the result handed to the recipient. Since this only happened during the first few decades of stamp usage, and only for the few letters that were sent great distances, very few covers have survived. For some combinations, only single examples have survived, and command spectacular prices among collectors.

Another form of mixed franking occurs in transitional periods, such as after the Irish Free State&#x27;s establishment from the United Kingdom in 1922 and 1923. This can be either as a way to help the public use up the stamps of a defunct government, or involuntarily as a propaganda tool.

An example of involuntary mixed franking is when Germany took over Austria in the Anschluss in 1938; during the several months while Austrian stamps were still accepted, Austrians sending mail to Germany were required to include a German stamp on the envelope.

Sometimes illegitimate mixed frankings occur when a postal user adds another country&#x27;s stamps to an envelope just for fun. Many countries&#x27; postal regulation require clerks to refuse to handle these, even if the correct postage of the country is present, because they slow down the sorting process, but such covers can still get through the system.

<text>Dale Bryan Murphy (born March 12, 1956) is an American former professional baseball player. During an 18-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to , he played as an outfielder, catcher, and first baseman for the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, and Colorado Rockies; Murphy is best noted for his many years with the Braves. His entire MLB career was spent in the National League (NL), during which time he won consecutive Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards (–), the Silver Slugger Award for four straight years (1982–), and the Gold Glove Award for five straight years (1982–). Murphy is a member of the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame, Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, and World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Dale Murphy was born in Portland, Oregon, on March 12, 1956, to parents Charles and Betty. He had a sister, Sue. Murphy played American Legion Baseball and attended Woodrow Wilson High School.

==Baseball==

===Playing career===
In 1976, Murphy began his major league career with a nineteen-game stint catching with the Atlanta Braves. He appeared in only eighteen games the following season. In 1978, Murphy played first base mostly; at the plate he had a .226 batting average, though he also showed hints of his future power by hitting 23 home runs.

Murphy switched to the outfield in 1980, a move that would help initiate a decade of highly productive play in the National League. Beginning in left field, he soon switched to center field, the position at which he would find his greatest success. By 1982, the most decorated year of Murphy&#x27;s career, the former catcher had transformed himself into an All-Star MVP outfielder who appeared in each of Atlanta&#x27;s 162 games. His turnaround as a fielder was equally stark. In 1978, Murphy led all National League first basemen in errors. In 1982, spending time at each of the three outfield positions, he won the first of five consecutive Gold Gloves, as well as the first MVP award by a Brave since 1957, when Hank Aaron won the award with the then-Milwaukee Braves.

Playing in the decade before the Braves began their dominance of the National League East, Murphy also made his only postseason appearance in 1982. Although he performed well, the eventual World Series-champion St. Louis Cardinals eliminated the Braves in the 1982 National League Championship Series. The league&#x27;s most valuable player failed to translate his regular season preeminence into October success, hitting safely only three times and scoring one run. Murphy rebounded from the postseason sweep with another MVP award in 1983. This time period ultimately proved the high-water era of Murphy&#x27;s career. Each year during the four season span from 1982 to 1986 he won a Gold Glove, appeared in the All-Star Game, and placed in the top ten in MVP voting.

In 1988, however, despite being voted to what would be his final All-Star appearance, Murphy&#x27;s production began a slide downward. Murphy saw his batting average free-fall from .295 in 1987 to .226 in 1988. Only once more, in 1991, would Murphy bat above .250. Once a consistent source of power at the plate, he never again hit 25 home runs or more in a season.

During his 15th season with the Braves, Murphy was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on August 3, 1990. Murphy&#x27;s time with the Phillies was mostly uneventful. A degenerative, arthritic condition in his left knee limited Murphy to only 18 games in the 1992 season with the Phillies, although he did hit two home runs in that time to bring his career total to 398. He was released by the Phillies at the end of 1993 Spring Training and, on the same day, signed a Minor League contract with the Colorado Rockies for their inaugural season. He was used mostly as a pinch hitter.

After going 0-for-3 with a strikeout in the Rockies&#x27; 8–0 road loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 21, 1993 (a rare start and, even more rare, only the fourth time all season he was in a game from the first pitch to the final out), Murphy did not play in the next 4 games. On the morning of May 27, 1993, while the Rockies were in Houston to begin a series with the Astros, he suddenly announced his retirement from baseball at age 37. He explained the Rockies were needing to make a 25-man roster move and informed him ahead of time he was going to be released. The team gave him the chance to retire instead of being released, which he did.

Murphy finished at 398 career home runs, failing to homer for the Rockies in 49 plate appearances and reach the 400-homer milestone. At the time of his retirement, he was 27th on the all-time home run list and 4th among active players, two behind Andre Dawson of the Boston Red Sox.

===Career summary and honors===
Murphy finished his career with 398 home runs, 1,266 RBI, and a .265 lifetime batting average. His MVP awards in 1982 and 1983 make him one of only four outfielders in MLB history with consecutive MVP years; at the time, he was the youngest to have accomplished the feat. His many honors include seven All-Star appearances, five Gold Gloves, and four Silver Sluggers. Murphy led the National League in home runs and runs batted in (RBI) twice; he also led the major leagues in home runs and RBI over the 10-year span from 1981 to 1990.

During the 1980s, Murphy led the National League in games, at bats, runs, hits, extra base hits, RBIs, runs created, total bases, and plate appearances. His 308 home runs during the decade is second only to Mike Schmidt&#x27;s 313. He also accomplished a 30–30 (30 home runs with 30 stolen bases) season in 1983. Murphy played in 740 consecutive games, at the time the 11th longest such streak in baseball history. His jersey number (&quot;3&quot;) was retired by the Atlanta Braves on June 13, 1994, in his honor as opposed to that of even Babe Ruth, who wore Boston Braves number 3 during the partial season with which his career concluded. Murphy was inducted into both the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.

===Public persona===
Murphy&#x27;s clean-living habits off the diamond were frequently noted in the media. A devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Murphy did not drink alcoholic beverages, would not allow women to be photographed embracing him, and paid his teammates&#x27; dinner checks as long as alcoholic beverages were not on the tab. He also refused to give television interviews unless he was fully dressed. Murphy had been introduced to the LDS Church early in his career by teammate Barry Bonnell.

For several years &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; ran a weekly column, wherein Murphy responded to young fans&#x27; questions and letters. In 1987 he shared &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Sportsmen and Sportswomen of the Year&quot; award with seven others, characterized as &quot;Athletes Who Care&quot;, for his work with numerous charities, including the Make-a-Wish Foundation, the Georgia March of Dimes and the American Heart Association.

One of his more memorable incidents was reminiscent of a scene from the classic black-and-white baseball film &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;:
Before a home game against San Francisco on June 12, 1983, Murphy visited in the stands with Elizabeth Smith, a six-year-old girl who had lost both hands and a leg when she stepped on a live power line. After Murphy gave her a cap and a T shirt, her nurse innocently asked if he could hit a home run for Elizabeth. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what to say, so I just sort of mumbled &#x27;Well, O.K.,&#x27; &quot; says Murphy. That day he hit two homers and drove in all the Braves&#x27; runs in a 3–2 victory.

He was ultimately granted several honors because of his integrity, character, and sportsmanship, including the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award (1985), &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; (1987), Roberto Clemente Award (1988), Bart Giamatti Community Service Award (1991), and World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame (1991 induction).

===Hall of Fame candidacy===
Despite his reputation as a star five-tool player superstar and multiple MVP awards, Murphy has not been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He first appeared on the writers&#x27; ballot in 1999. He has failed to gain election, joining Barry Bonds, Roger Maris, and Juan González as the only Hall of Fame-eligible recipients of multiple MVP awards not in the Hall. His failed candidacy has drawn particular notice due to his reputation as a clean-living player whose career was immediately followed by baseball&#x27;s scandal-plagued &quot;steroids era&quot;.

Baseball writer Rob Neyer feels that the former MVP&#x27;s candidacy has been hurt by a career that &quot;got a late start and suffered an early end.&quot; Stuart Miller, baseball writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, also notes the &quot;sharp decline&quot; in production that plagued Murphy after the age of 31 in arguing, &quot;Players who were great for a short time do not receive much [Hall of Fame] recognition.&quot; Finding &quot;one of baseball&#x27;s best players in the 1980s&quot; to be &quot;undervalued&quot;, Miller nonetheless writes that the Brave great &quot;is typically considered a &#x27;close but no&#x27; guy.&quot; Statistician Bill James says of Murphy, &quot;It certainly wouldn&#x27;t offend me to have him in the Hall of Fame. I just wouldn&#x27;t advocate it.&quot; James set a metric for Hall induction as 300 Win Shares, a statistic weighing what players contribute to their team&#x27;s victories. Murphy has 253 Win Shares. James ranks eight Hall of Famers below Murphy.

A writer for the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; wrote, &quot;Murphy&#x27;s incredible nine-year run in Atlanta was every bit as good as anyone else during his era&quot;. Neyer notes that the explosion of power during the steroids-fueled era that began after Murphy&#x27;s retirement may have caused Murphy&#x27;s numbers to pale in comparison for many voters. Some have argued that Murphy&#x27;s reputation for clean living may encourage voters to &quot;look more favorably on what Murphy did without using performance-enhancing drugs.&quot; (Murphy has asserted that Barry Bonds &quot;without a doubt&quot; used performance-enhancing drugs.) &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Joe Posnanski has endorsed Murphy as an &quot;emotional pick … a larger-than-life character who signed every autograph, spoke up for every charity and played brilliant baseball every day for mostly doomed teams.&quot; The Baseball Project, a supergroup composed of Peter Buck, Mike Mills, Scott McCaughey, Steve Wynn and Linda Pitmon, wrote the song “To The Veterans Committee” advocating his election and praising him for meeting the voting criteria: ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.

Although he continued to earn the requisite 5% to remain on the ballot, Murphy averaged only 13.6% over the first twelve years of voting. (Election to the hall requires 75%.) In the first decade of his eligibility, he &quot;peaked at 23% in 2000 and fell to 11.5% in 2009.&quot; Moreover, as writers may only vote for ten players each year, some have argued that the candidacy of stars from the 1980s, such as Murphy, will become imperiled as a wave of more recently retired players with more statistically impressive credentials becomes eligible in the 2010s. Noting his low vote totals, Murphy has said, &quot;Since I&#x27;m not that close [to election] … I don&#x27;t think about it that much.&quot; On January 9, 2013, in his 15th and final appearance on the Hall of Fame ballot, Murphy secured 18.9% of the vote, falling well short of the 75% necessary to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame on the BBWAA ballot. Since Murphy&#x27;s removal from the BBWAA ballot, his Hall of Fame candidacy has been considered twice by the Modern Era Baseball Committee, in 2018 and 2020, and once by the Contemporary Baseball Era Players Committee in 2022.

==Post-baseball life==
From 1997 to 2000, Murphy served as president of the Massachusetts Boston Mission of the LDS Church.

In 2005, Murphy started a non-profit organization called the iWontCheat Foundation to promote ethical behavior, and deter steroid use and cheating in youth athletics. Since 2008 all players from the participating teams at the Little League World Series wear the &quot;I WON&#x27;T CHEAT!&quot; embroidered patch above the Little League Baseball logo on the left sleeve of their jerseys.

In 2008, he was appointed to the National Advisory Board for the national children&#x27;s charity, Operation Kids. Murphy serves as a national advisor to . Murphy is a long time supporter of Operation Smile and also currently serves on the organization&#x27;s Board of Governors.

During the 2012 MLB season, Murphy was a part of the Atlanta Braves TV broadcasting crew and participated in the telecast of at least 14 games.

He was the first-base coach for the USA team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

In 2017 he opened a restaurant, Murph&#x27;s, in Atlanta near Truist Park, where the Braves have played since the 2017 season. He lives in Alpine, Utah.

==Author==
Murphy has written three books. The first, &quot;The Scouting Report on Professional Athletics&quot;, is about the professional athlete&#x27;s lifestyle. Murphy discusses balancing career and family, working with agents, managing business affairs, serving one&#x27;s community, and preparing for retirement. In his second book, an autobiography titled &quot;Murph&quot;, he talked about his religious faith. He discussed the struggles of his early baseball career and how he overcame problems. In 2007 Murphy wrote his third book, &quot;The Scouting Report for Youth Athletics&quot;, in response to what he saw as the increase in negative behavior in youth sports resulting from poor examples set by professional athletes. Included with each book is a 50-page insert which includes contributions from, among others, Peyton Manning, Dwyane Wade, Tom Glavine, and Danica Patrick. In a question-and-answer format, they discuss the lessons they learned from youth sports and how they apply the lessons today. There is also a physician-penned section about illegal performance-enhancing drug use in sports.

==Personal life==
Murphy and his wife, Nancy, have eight children: sons Chad, Travis, Shawn, Tyson, Taylor, Jake, and McKay, and daughter Madison.

<text>Rotary International is one of the largest service organizations in the world. The self-declared mission of Rotary, as stated on its website, is to &quot;provide service to others, promote integrity, and advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace through [the] fellowship of business, professional, and community leaders&quot;. It is a non-political and non-religious organization. Membership is by application or invitation and based on various social factors. There are over 46,000 member clubs worldwide, with a membership of 1.4 million individuals, known as Rotarians.

Rotary International is the organization of service clubs with the largest membership in the world, with 1.9 million volunteers, including all the members of clubs that make up the Rotary family, namely Rotary, Interact and Rotaract clubs.

== History ==
=== The first years of the Rotary Club ===
The first Rotary Club was formed when attorney Paul P. Harris called together a meeting of three business acquaintances in downtown Chicago, United States, at Harris&#x27;s friend Gustave Loehr&#x27;s office in the Unity Building on Dearborn Street on February 23, 1905. In addition to Harris and Loehr (a mining engineer and freemason), Silvester Schiele (a coal merchant), and Hiram E. Shorey (a tailor) were the other two who attended this first meeting. The members chose the name &quot;Rotary&quot; because initially they rotated subsequent weekly club meetings to each other&#x27;s offices, although within a year, the Chicago club became so large it became necessary to adopt the now-common practice of a regular meeting place.

The next four Rotary Clubs were organized in cities in the western United States, beginning with San Francisco, then Oakland, Seattle, and Los Angeles. The National Association of Rotary Clubs in America was formed in 1910. On November 3, 1910, a Rotary club began meeting in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, marking the beginning of Rotary as an international organization. On 22 February 1911, the first meeting of the Rotary Club Dublin was held in Dublin, Ireland. This was the first club established outside of North America. In April 1912, the Winnipeg club was chartered, marking the first official establishment of an American-style service club outside the United States. To reflect the addition of a club outside of the United States, the name was changed to the International Association of Rotary Clubs in 1912.

In August 1912, the Rotary Club of London received its charter from the Association, marking the first acknowledged Rotary club outside North America. It later became known that the Dublin club in Ireland was organized before the London club, but the Dublin club did not receive its charter until after the London club was chartered.
During World War I, Rotary in Britain increased from 9 to 22 clubs, and other early clubs in other nations included those in Cuba in 1916, the Philippines in 1919 and India in 1920.

In 1922, the name was changed to Rotary International. From 1923 to 1928, Rotary&#x27;s office and headquarters were located on E 20th Street (now E Cullerton Street) in the Atwell Building. During this same time, the monthly magazine &quot;The Rotarian&quot; was published mere floors below by Atwell Printing and Binding Company. By 1925, Rotary had grown to 200 clubs with more than 20,000 members. During the 1930s there was an expanding conflict in Asia between Japan and China and the fear of a confrontation between Japan and the United States. In hopes of helping resolve these issues, a leading Japanese international statesman, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa, was chosen as the Honorary Keynote Speaker at Rotary&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Convention held in 1930 in Chicago. Prince Tokugawa held the position of president of Japan&#x27;s upper house of congress, the National Diet, for 30 years. Tokugawa promoted democratic principles and international goodwill. It was only after his death in 1940 that Japanese militants were able to push Japan into joining the Axis Powers in WWII.

===World War II era in Europe===
Rotary Clubs in Spain ceased to operate shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.

Clubs were disbanded across Europe as follows:
* Netherlands (1923)
* Belgium (1923)
* Finland (1926)
* Germany (1927)
* Austria (1938)
* Italy (1939)
* Czechoslovakia (1940)
* Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Yugoslavia and Luxembourg (1941)
* Hungary (1941/1942)

Rotary International has worked with the UN since the UN started in 1945. At that time Rotary was involved in 65 countries. The two organizations shared ideals around promoting peace. Rotary received consultative status at the UN in 1946–47.

During the Third Reich, Rotary Clubs were grouped with Freemasonry as secret societies associated with Jews, and Nazi officials were banned from joining them. This was reversed in July 1933 after appeals but the club was forced to ban all Jews from membership. This led to several non-Jews quitting in solidarity. In order to survive, the members tried to show their loyalty to the Nazi leadership, inviting government officials and high-standing businesspeople. These included Hermann Schlosser, a business manager for Degesch – which supplied Zyklon B for use at death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau. After 1945, the Rotary club tried to control the damage by preventing members such as Hans Globke and Wolfgang A. Wick from being appointed presidents.

===From 1945 onward===
Rotary clubs in Eastern Europe and communist nations were disbanded by 1945–46, but new Rotary clubs were organized in many other countries, and by the time of the national independence movements in Africa and Asia, the new nations already had Rotary clubs.

On January 11, 1951, a decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, published by &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, forbade Catholics clergy to accept membership of Rotary clubs. On January 27, 1951, a second decree of the Holy Office specified that warning against membership by laymen applied in some countries but not in the U.S.

Relationships with the Roman Catholic Church were changed again by Paul VI and John Paul II.

After the relaxation of government control of community groups in Russia and former Warsaw Pact nations, Rotarians were welcomed as club organizers, and clubs were formed in those countries, beginning with the Moscow club in 1990.

In 1985, Rotary launched its PolioPlus program to immunize all of the world&#x27;s children against polio. As of 2011, Rotary had contributed more than 900 million US dollars to the cause.

, Rotary had more than 1.4 million members in over 36,000 clubs among 200 countries and geographical areas, making it the most widespread by branches and second largest service club by membership, behind Lions Clubs International. The number of Rotarians has slightly declined in recent years: Between 2002 and 2006, they went from 1,245,000 to 1,223,000 members. North America accounts for 450,000 members, Asia for 300,000, Europe for 250,000, Latin America for 100,000, Oceania for 100,000 and Africa for 30,000.

== Organization and administration ==

In order to carry out its service programs, Rotary is structured in club, district and international levels. Rotarians are members of their clubs. The clubs are chartered by the global organization Rotary International (RI) headquartered in Evanston, Illinois. For administrative purposes, the more than 46,000 clubs worldwide are grouped into 529 districts, and the districts into 34 zones.

=== Rotary Clubs ===

The Rotary Club is the basic unit of Rotary activity, and each club determines its own membership. Clubs originally were limited to a single club per city, municipality, or town, but Rotary International has encouraged the formation of one or more additional clubs in the largest cities when practical. Most clubs meet weekly, usually at a mealtime on a weekday in a regular location, when Rotarians can discuss club business and hear from guest speakers. Each club also conducts various service projects within its local community, and participates in special projects involving other clubs in the local district, and occasionally a special project in a &quot;sister club&quot; in another nation. Most clubs also hold social events at least quarterly and in some cases more often.

Each club elects its own president and officers among its active members for a one-year term. The clubs enjoy considerable autonomy within the framework of the standard constitution and the constitution and bylaws of Rotary International. The governing body of the club is the Club Board (sometimes called Club Council), consisting of the club president (who serves as the Board chairman), a president-elect, club secretary, club treasurer, and several Club Board directors, including the immediate past president and the President Elect. The president usually appoints the directors to serve as chairs of the major club committees, including those responsible for club service, vocational service, community service, youth service, and international service.

Rotarians may attend any Rotary club around the world at one of their weekly meetings.

=== Rotaract Clubs ===

Rotaract is the Rotary-affiliated organization for young adults (university age and young professionals). They take action through community and international service, learn leadership skills, and participate in professional development. Rotaract clubs are either community or university based. &quot;Rotaract&quot; stands for &quot;Rotary in Action&quot;, and its motto is &quot;Self Development – Fellowship through Service&quot;.

Rotaract began as a program of Rotary International, and its first club was founded in 1968 by Charlotte North Rotary Club, located in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In 2019, Rotaract went from being a program of Rotary International to being a membership type of Rotary International, elevating its status to resemble that of Rotary clubs. As of 1 July 2020, Rotaract clubs can exist on their own, or may be sponsored by Rotary and/or Rotaract clubs. This makes them true &quot;partners in service&quot; and key members of the family of Rotary. A Rotaract club may, but is not required to, establish upper age limits, provided that the club (in accordance with its bylaws) obtain the concurrence of its members.

=== District level ===
A District Governor (DG), who is an officer of Rotary International and represents the RI board of directors in the field, leads their respective Rotary district. Each DG is nominated by the clubs of their district, and elected by all the clubs meeting in the annual RI District Conference held each year. The DG appoints Assistant Governors (AGs) from among the Rotarians of the district to assist in the management of Rotary activity and multi-club projects in the district. AGs act as liaisons between the DG and the clubs, to make communication flow more smoothly throughout the District.

As part of a DG&#x27;s duties, they must visit every club in their District at least once during their year as DG in order to spread the RI President&#x27;s message and theme for that year. The AGs are assigned specific clubs to be under their purview, and they must accompany the DG on their official club visits to those particular clubs.

=== Zone level ===
Approximately 15 Rotary districts form a zone. A zone director, who serves as a member of the RI board of directors, heads two zones. The zone director is nominated by the clubs in the zone and elected by the convention for the term of two consecutive years.

=== Rotary International ===
Rotary International is governed by a board of directors composed of the international president, the president-elect, the general secretary, and 17 zone directors. The nomination and the election of each president is handled in the one- to three-year period before the president takes office, and is based on requirements including geographical balance among Rotary zones and previous service as a district governor and board member. The international board meets quarterly to establish policies and make recommendations to the overall governing bodies, the RI Convention and the RI Council on Legislation.

====Rotary International President====
Rotary&#x27;s president presides over the Board of Directors and is elected to a one-year term. Stephanie A. Urchick is the current president of Rotary International. She holds a doctorate in leadership studies from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. She is active on numerous community boards and committees and has been honored by organizations including Zonta International and the Sons of the American Revolution.

====General Secretary / CEO====
Rotary International has a general secretary, who also acts as chief executive officer and leads the Rotary Foundation. The current holder of the post is John Hewko.

==Membership==
According to its constitutions (&quot;Charters&quot;), Rotary defines itself as a non-partisan, non-sectarian organization. Membership is open to &quot;adult persons who demonstrate good character, integrity, and leadership; possess good reputation within their business, profession, occupation, and/or community.&quot;

One can contact a Rotary club to inquire about membership and it was a traditional method that a person can join a Rotary club only if invited; there is the ability to join without an invitation but it is recommended to attend a meeting to ensure a suitable fit to the club.

=== Active membership ===
Active membership is by invitation from a current Rotarian, to professionals or businesspersons working in diverse areas of endeavour. Each club may limit up to ten percent of its membership representing each business or profession in the area it serves. The goal of the clubs is to promote service to the community they work in, as well as to the wider world. Many projects are organised for the local community by a single club, but some are organised globally.

=== Honorary membership ===

Clubs may award honorary membership in recognition of a person&#x27;s distinguished efforts in furtherance of Rotary ideals or otherwise in support of Rotary&#x27;s cause. As the highest distinction a Rotary club can confer on an individual, it is exercised only in exceptional cases. Honorary members are exempt from the payment of admission fees and dues. They have no voting privileges and are not eligible to hold any office in their club. Honorary membership is time-limited and terminates automatically at the end of the term, usually one year. It may be extended for an additional period or may also be revoked at any time. Examples of honorary members are heads of state or former heads of state, scientists, members of the military, and other famous figures. However, as each club may establish different rules for honorary members, there will be some variation in terms of selection and privileges of honorary members. A recent Rotary 3191 District in India appointed global health physician Dr. Edmond Fernandes as Honorary Member for outstanding public health service to India and around the world.

=== Female membership ===
From 1905 until the 1980s, women were not allowed membership in Rotary clubs, although Rotarian spouses, including Paul Harris&#x27;s wife Jean, were often members of the similar &quot;Inner Wheel&quot; club. Women did play some roles, and Jean Thomson Harris made numerous speeches. Dale Carnegie&#x27;s biographer Carlos Roberto Bacila describes that in 1955 when women were not permitted to attend Rotary meetings, the Brooklyn Rotary Club made an exception and finally allowed Marilyn Burke, Carnegie&#x27;s secretary, to accompany him in a lecture inside the Rotary. In 1963, it was noted that the Rotary practice of involving wives in club activities had helped to break down female seclusion in some countries. Clubs such as Rotary were predated by women&#x27;s service organisations, which started in the United States as early as 1790.

The first Irish clubs discussed admitting women as members in 1912, but the proposal foundered over issues of social class. Gender equity in Rotary moved beyond the theoretical question when in 1976, the Rotary Club of Duarte, California, admitted three women as members. After the club refused to remove the women from membership, Rotary International revoked the club&#x27;s charter in 1978. The Duarte club filed suit in the California courts, claiming that Rotary Clubs are business establishments subject to regulation under California&#x27;s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which bans discrimination based on race, gender, religion or ethnic origin. Rotary International then appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The RI attorney argued that &quot;... [the decision] threatens to force us to take in everyone, like a motel&quot;. The Duarte Club was not alone in opposing RI leadership; the Seattle-International District club unanimously voted to admit women in 1986. The United States Supreme Court, on 4 May 1987, confirmed the Californian decision supporting women, in the case &quot;Board of Directors, Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte&quot;. Rotary International then removed the gender requirements from its requirements for club charters, and most clubs in most countries have opted to include women as members of Rotary Clubs. The first female club president to be elected was Sylvia Whitlock of the Rotary Club of Duarte, California in 1987. By 2007, there was a female trustee of Rotary&#x27;s charitable wing The Rotary Foundation while female district governors and club presidents were common.

Women currently account for 22% of international Rotary membership. In 2013, Anne L. Matthews, a Rotarian from South Carolina, began her term as the first female vice-president of Rotary International. Also in 2013, Nan McCreadie was appointed as the first female president of Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland (RIBI). The first woman to join Rotary in Ghana, West Africa was Hilda Danquah (Rotary Club of Cape Coast) in 1992. The first woman president in Ghana was Dr. Naana Agyeman-Mensah in 2001 (Rotary Club of Accra-Airport). Up until 2013, there has been 46 women presidents in the 30 Rotary clubs in Ghana. In 2013, Stella Dongo from Zimbabwe was appointed District Governor for District 9210 (Zimbabwe/Zambia/Malawi/Northern-Mozambique) for the Rotary year 2013–14 making her the first female District Governor in the region. She had previously held the offices of Assistant Governor (2006–08), District Administrator (2008–09) and President of The Rotary Club of Highlands (2005–06). She was also Zimbabwe&#x27;s Country Coordinator (2009–10). Stella, who is a Master PRLS 5 Graduate has been recognised and awarded various District awards including Most Able President for year 2005–06 and Assistant Governor of the year 2006–07 and a Paul Harris Fellow.
The first female to be President of Rotary International will be Jennifer E. Jones of the Windsor Roseland Rotary Club in Windsor, Ontario Canada.

The change of the second Rotarian motto in 2004, from &quot;He profits most who serves best&quot; to &quot;They profit most who serve best&quot;, 99 years after its foundation, illustrates the move to general acceptance of women members in Rotary.

=== Racial and sexual orientation diversity ===
The first Rotary Clubs in Asia were in Manila in the Philippines and Shanghai in China, each in July 1919. Rotary&#x27;s office in Illinois immediately began encouraging the Rotary Club of Shanghai to recruit Chinese members &quot;believing that when a considerable number of the native business and professional men have been so honoured, the Shanghai Club will begin to realize its period of greatest success.&quot; As part of considering the application of a Club to be chartered in Kolkata (then Calcutta), India in January 1920 and Tokyo, Japan in October 1920, Rotary formally considered the issue of racial restriction in membership and determined that the organization could not allow racial restrictions to the organization&#x27;s growth. In Rotary&#x27;s legislative deliberations in June 1921, it was formally determined that racial restrictions would not be permitted. Non-racialism was included in the terms of the standard constitution in 1922 and required to be adopted by all member Clubs.

Rotary and other service clubs in the last decade of the 20th century became open to gay members.

==Affiliates==
Rotary Clubs sponsor a number of affiliated clubs that promote the goals of Rotary in their community.

=== Inner Wheel Clubs ===

Inner Wheel is an international organization founded in 1924 to unite wives and daughters of Rotarians. Inner Wheel Clubs exist in over 103 countries. Like Rotary, Inner Wheel is divided into local clubs and districts.

== Programs and activities of Rotary International ==

Rotary concentrates on seven areas: promoting peace, improving health through disease prevention and treatment, improving the health of mothers and children, water and sanitation, education, economic development, and supporting the environment.

=== PolioPlus ===
The most notable current global project, PolioPlus, is contributing to the global eradication of polio.
Sergio Mulitsch di Palmenberg (1923–1987), Governor of RI District 204 (1984–1985), founder of the RC of Treviglio and Pianura Bergamasca (Italy), was the man who inspired and promoted the RI PolioPlus vaccination campaign. Mulitsch made it possible shipping the first 500,000 doses of antipolio vaccine to the Philippines at the beginning of 1980. This project later gave rise to the NGO &quot;Nuovi Spazi al Servire&quot; co-ordinated by Luciano Ravaglia (RC Forlì, Italy).
Since beginning the project in 1985, Rotarians have contributed over US$850 million and hundreds of thousands of volunteer-hours, contributing to the inoculation of more than two billion of the world&#x27;s children. Inspired by Rotary&#x27;s commitment, the World Health Organization (WHO) passed a resolution in 1988 to eradicate polio by 2000. Now a partner in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) with WHO, UNICEF and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary is recognized by the United Nations as the key private partner in the eradication effort.

In 2008, Rotary received a $100 million challenge grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Rotary committed to raising $100 million. In January 2009, Bill Gates announced a second challenge grant of $255 million. Rotary again committed to raising another $100 million. In total, Rotary will raise $200 million by 30 June 2012. Together, the Gates Foundation and Rotary have committed $555 million toward the eradication of polio. At the time of the second challenge grant, Bill Gates said:

There has been some limited criticism concerning the program for polio eradication. There are some reservations regarding the adaptation capabilities of the virus in some of the oral vaccines, which have been reported to cause infection in populations with low vaccination coverage. As stated by Vaccine Alliance, however, in spite of the limited risk of polio vaccination, it would neither be prudent nor practicable to cease the vaccination program until there is strong evidence that &quot;all wild poliovirus transmission [has been] stopped&quot;. In a 2006 speech at the Rotary International Convention, held at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Bruce Cohick stated that polio in all its known wild forms would be eliminated by late 2008, provided efforts in Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India all proceed with their current momentum. As of October 2012, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan still had wild polio, but it had been eliminated in India.

In 2014, polio survivor and Rotarian Ramesh Ferris met with the Dalai Lama to discuss the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The meeting went viral via a selfie taken by Ferris with the Dalai Lama.

=== Interact ===
Interact is Rotary International&#x27;s service club for young people ages 12 to 18. Interact clubs are sponsored by Rotary clubs (and may be co-sponsored by Rotaract clubs), which provide support and guidance, but they are self-governing and self-supporting.

Club membership varies greatly. Clubs can be single gender or mixed, large or small. They can draw from the student body of a single school or from two or more schools in the same community, and welcome home-schooled students.

Each year, Interact clubs complete at least two community service projects, one of which furthers international understanding and goodwill. Through these efforts, Interactors develop a network of friendships with local and overseas clubs and learn the importance of
* Developing leadership skills and personal integrity
* Demonstrating helpfulness and respect for others
* Understanding the value of individual responsibility and hard work
* Advancing international understanding and goodwill

As one of the most significant and fastest-growing programs of Rotary service, with more than 15,000 clubs in more than 145 countries and geographical areas, Interact has become a worldwide phenomenon. Almost 340,000 young people are involved in Interact.
Interact stands for “International Action”.

=== RYLA ===
RYLA, or , is a leadership program for young people aged 14 to 30. The Rotary Youth Leadership Awards program offers Rotarians an opportunity to personally participate in developing qualities of leadership, good citizenship, and personal and professional development in the young people of their communities. RYLA program content and format can be customized to target limited age groups in order to address varying needs and interests within the community.

=== Rotary Community Corps ===
The Rotary Community Corps (RCC) is a volunteer organization which facilitates non-Rotarians who want to help meet community needs. As of 2021, there were close to 12,000 RCC members in over 100 countries.

===Exchanges and scholarships===
Some of Rotary&#x27;s most visible programs include Rotary Youth Exchange (RYE), a student exchange program for students in secondary education, from which Rotex was created to aid these programs. The Rotary Foundation&#x27;s oldest program, Ambassadorial Scholarships ended in 2013. Effective July 2009, the Rotary Foundation previously ended funding for the &quot;Cultural and Multi-Year Ambassadorial Scholarships&quot; as well as &quot;Rotary Grants for University Teachers&quot;.

Georgia Rotary Student Program (GRSP) is a program that offers scholarships to international college students to study in the state of Georgia. It is a one-year ambassadorial scholarship that aims to promote peace, one of the causes of Rotary International, through friendship and cultural understanding.

Rotary Fellowships, paid by the foundation launched in honor of Paul Harris in 1947, specialize in providing graduate fellowships around the world, usually in countries other than their own in order to provide international exposure and experience to the recipient.

Recently, a new program was established known as the Rotary peace and Conflict Resolution program which provides funds for two years of graduate study in one of eight universities around the world. Rotary is naming about 75 of these scholars each year. The applications for these scholarships are found on line but each application must be endorsed by a local Rotary Club. Children and other close relatives of Rotarians are not eligible.

Adults up to the age of 30 may participate in &quot;New Generations Service Exchange&quot; for up to six months and may be organized for individuals or groups. The minimum age of the participants shall be the age of majority in the host country, but not be younger than age 18. New Generations Service Exchanges must have a strong humanitarian or vocational service component.

=== Rotary Peace Centers ===
Starting in 2002, The Rotary Foundation partnered with eight universities around the world to create the Rotary Centers for International Studies in peace and conflict resolution. The universities included International Christian University (Japan), University of Queensland (Australia), Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) (France), University of Bradford (UK), Universidad del Salvador (Argentina), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (US), Duke University (US), and University of California, Berkeley (US) Since then, the Rotary Foundation&#x27;s Board of Trustees has dropped its association with the Center in France at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, the Center in Argentina at the Universidad del Salvador, and the Center in the US at the University of California. In 2006, a new Rotary Peace Center at Chulalongkorn University (Thailand) began offering a three-month professional development program in peace and conflict studies for mid-level and upper-level professionals. In 2011, the Rotary Peace Center at Uppsala University (Sweden) was established and began offering a two-year master&#x27;s program in peace and conflict studies.

Up to 100 Rotary Peace Fellows are selected annually to earn either a professional development certificate in peace and conflict studies or a master&#x27;s degree in a range of disciplines related to peace and security. Each Rotary Peace Center offers a unique curriculum and field-based learning opportunities that examine peace and conflict theory through a variety of different frameworks. The first class graduated in 2004. As with many such university programs in &quot;peace and conflict studies&quot;, questions have been raised concerning political bias and controversial grants. The average grant was about $75,000 per fellow for the two-year program and $12,000 per fellow for the three-month certificate program.

===Literacy programs===
Rotary clubs worldwide place a focus on increasing literacy. Such importance has been placed on literacy that Rotary International has created a &quot;Rotary Literacy Month&quot; that takes place during the month of March. Rotary clubs also aim to conduct many literacy events during the week of September 8, which is International Literacy Day. Some Rotary clubs raise funds for schools and other literacy organizations. Many clubs take part in a reading program called &quot;Rotary Readers&quot;, in which a Rotary member spends time in a classroom with a designated student, and reads one-on-one with them. Some Rotary clubs participate in book donations, both locally and internationally. As well as participating in book donations and literacy events, there are educational titles written about Rotary Clubs and members, such as &quot;Rotary Clubs Help People&quot;, &quot;Carol is a Rotarian&quot; by Rotarian and children&#x27;s book author Bruce Larkin and &quot;Rhoda&#x27;s Rescue&quot; by Maine author Barbara Walsh in conjunction with Rotary Club of Waterville, Maine&#x27;s Rhoda Reads early literacy program.

== Rotex - District 4851 ==
Rotex stands for Rotary Exchange. It is an alumni association created to support the exchange program Rotary Youth Exchange (RYE) and its participants. It is a society composed of former RYE students that functions as a middleman between Rotary Clubs and current exchange students and these clubs follow Rotary&#x27;s districtual organization. The fact that Rotex is currently established in Argentina facilitates the process of exchange by helping RYE with administrative issues and providing emotional support to both Argentinian and foreign exchange students. The members of Rotex share the same values as Rotary International. According to Rotex&#x27;s bylaw, their aim is to promote peace and connection around the world. Rotex members and exchange students act as peace ambassadors, based on the idea that when two countries know each other (by their citizens sharing experiences together), they are very unlikely to be in conflict. 

=== Creation ===
The first steps towards the formal foundation of Rotex International started in 2012 in Bordeaux, France, when Rebounds from all around the world met and began to think about how to form an alumni association; this is considered the 1st Rotex Convention even though it was not yet acknowledged as such by Rotary. In 2014, the 2nd Convention took place in Brussels, where these Rebounds got together with the aim of improving this association, but still they were not recognized by Rotary as a part of the organization. It was in the 3rd Rotex Convention that this alumni association was formally acknowledged by Rotary and the first board of Rotex was elected. When it comes to the District 4851 of Rotex in Argentina, it was officially founded on June 15, 2023.The certificate issued to the association by Rotary International is herein cited.

=== Composition: District 4851 ===
The Argentinian district is made up of the ex-Districts 4815 and 4849 which were fused into the new “District 4851”,  which consists of more than 100 clubs and encompasses the provinces of Córdoba, Catamarca, La Rioja, Salta, Jujuy, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, San Luis, Mendoza and San Juan.

=== Membership and responsibilities ===
In order to join Rotex in the District 4851, it is necessary to have participated in the RYE program uninterruptedly and successfully, i.e. without any warning for not following Rotary&#x27;s rules during the exchange and at least six months must have passed after the exchange has finished. Other requirements are to have completed the exchange with District 4851, and to be currently living in one of the District 4851&#x27;s provinces. Rotex participants’ responsibilities imply ensuring that Outbound, Inbound, and Rebound students from the RYE program are well-supported, share practices and are informed about the values that have to be followed. Rotex members also organize trips and events for exchange students to bound and conferences to better cope with administrative matters and to develop skills to deal with potential challenges that could arise when taking care of underage exchange students. 

=== Income ===
Rotex 4851&#x27;s income mainly comes from donations from both public and private institutions, cultural, social and sports activities open to the community, contributions from Rotary International and other Rotary clubs, among others. 

=== Structure ===
Rotex&#x27;s authorities of District 4851 are hierarchically organized into three constitutive parts: Board of Directors, Committees and Assemblies. All charges last one year, from July to June. Apart from Rotex&#x27;s authorities, there are also commissions made up of the members who contact new exchange students and help them with their exchange process. 

Board of Directors: It is the executive organ of District 4851 which is composed of the President, the Vice president, the Secretary, the Prosecretary, and the Treasurer. The members of the Board are chosen annually according to the Rotary calendar. The Board of Directors attends all RYE events of District 4851, manages Rotex 4851 income, and elaborates a presentation at the beginning and end of the annual period, in which they hand in a balance sheet with the Board&#x27;s expectations and detailed information. 

Committees: The Committees are composed of elected Rotary members. 

Assemblies: The Assemblies consist of the Board of Directors and the Committees. In these Assemblies, Ordinary and Extraordinary meetings are held at least once per month. Some topics which are dealt with in these meetings include the coordination and election of Committees as well as the planification of the schedule of activities. Furthermore, the Assembly has the power to elect and remove authorities, approve the  balance sheet of the outgoing mandate and modify or remove provisions in the Internal Regulations of Rotex 4851.

Commissions: Commissions are made up of Rotex official members. The work zones are specialized and focused according to the needs that the commissions think necessary. Members work according to the roles of Managers and Coordinators in relation to the following commissions: 

# Rotary Candidates;
# Inbounds;
# Outbounds;
# Rotex Candidates.

All commissions are made up of Rotex volunteers or Rotex members who are recommended by the Board of Directors and/or the International Committee.

=== Terminology ===

* Outbound: A RYE student before and during exchange, from the perspective of their sponsoring district(s).
* Inbound: A RYE student before and during exchange, from the perspective of their host district(s).
* Rebound: A RYE student after they have completed their exchange year and returned to their home country.
* RYE Alumni: All former Rotary Youth Exchange program participants.
* Rotex: RYE alumni who actively support the RYE program and its participants.
* Rotex Association: An organization of Rotex, usually covering the same area as its respective RYE program. This is most often organized at the district or multidistrict level.

== Publications ==
Rotary International publishes an official monthly magazine now named &quot;Rotary&quot; in English (first published in 1911 as &quot;The National Rotarian&quot;). From April 1923 to August 1928, the official magazine was managed and printed from the same building – the Atwell Building – as Rotary&#x27;s office and headquarters; the building was designed for Atwell Printing and Binding Company by famed Chicago architect, Alfred S. Alschuler.

Other periodicals are independently produced in more than 20 different major languages and distributed in 130 countries. One of them is &quot;Rotary Norden&quot; which is distributed in four language editions in five countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

<text>Mirage Resorts (formerly Golden Nugget Companies) was an American company that owned and operated hotel-casinos. It was acquired by MGM Grand, Inc. in 2000, forming MGM Mirage (now MGM Resorts International).

==History==
Golden Nugget Companies Inc. was formed by Steve Wynn in 1973. The company was created after Wynn acquired majority control of the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 1980, the company opened the Golden Nugget Atlantic City in New Jersey but in 1987, Wynn&#x27;s and the company&#x27;s interest in Atlantic City did not last very long due to frustration with state gaming regulators. The property was sold to Bally&#x27;s Entertainment, and eventually became Bally&#x27;s Grand Hotel and Casino.

In 1989, the company acquired the Nevada Club casino in Laughlin, Nevada, and re-branded it as the Golden Nugget Laughlin.

===The Mirage and Treasure Island (1990s)===
Wynn&#x27;s first major casino on the Las Vegas Strip was The Mirage, which opened in November 1989. It was the first time Wynn was involved with the design and construction of a casino, and he financed the $630 million project largely with high-yield bonds issued by Michael Milken. The resort&#x27;s high cost and emphasis on luxury meant that it was considered high risk at the time, though the project ended up being enormously lucrative. The hotel, with its erupting volcano and South Seas theme, ignited a $12 billion building boom on the Strip. Its construction is also considered noteworthy in that Wynn had set a new standard for Vegas resorts, and when it opened The Mirage was the first casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games. Known for its entertainment, the hotel became the exclusive venue for the &quot;Siegfried &amp; Roy&quot; show in 1990, and in 1993 the hotel hosted the Cirque du Soleil show &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot;. Afterwards Wynn decided to invite Cirque to create &quot;Mystère&quot; for the soon-to-be-built Treasure Island resort next door.

Following the completion of The Mirage in 1989 Steve Wynn changed the name of the company to Mirage Resorts, Inc. Much of the financing for the Mirage was obtained in cooperation with Michael Milken.

After the Mirage, Wynn built the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, which he opened in the Mirage&#x27;s old parking lot in 1993, and overall cost $450 million. Intended to be family-friendly, the resort featured pools in front of the casino enacted the Battle of Buccaneer Bay with two full-scaled ships, the pirate ship &#x27;Hispaniola&#x27; and the British Royal Navy frigate &#x27;HMS Britannia,&#x27; while the inside featured romantic tropical theming and 18th century Caribbean pirate theming. The establishment was the home of the first permanent Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas, and the show went on to be voted nine times as the best production show in the city by the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; reader&#x27;s poll.

In 1994, Gold Strike Resorts announced a partnership with Mirage Resorts to build a $250-million casino targeted at budget-conscious visitors, on part of the site of the demolished Dunes on the Las Vegas Strip. It ultimately opened in 1996, following Gold Strike&#x27;s merger with Circus Circus Enterprises as Monte Carlo Resort and Casino and was built as a joint venture between Mirage Resorts and Circus Circus Enterprises, and cost US$344 million to build. The resort sits on , occupied by the Dunes Hotel golf course until its demolition in October 1993.

In 1995, the company proposed to build the Le Jardin hotel-casino in the marina area if the state of New Jersey built a road that connected to the hotel-casino. The company had also agreed to allow Circus Circus Enterprises and Boyd Gaming to build casinos on the site, but later reneged on the agreement. While the road, called the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, was eventually built, Le Jardin was cancelled after the company was acquired in 2000 by MGM Grand Inc., which later built the Borgata, in a joint venture with Boyd Gaming, on the site.

Boardwalk Hotel and Casino was later acquired by Mirage Resorts in 1997.

===Bellagio and Beau Rivage debuts (1998–1999)===
In October 1998, Wynn opened the even more opulent Bellagio, a $1.6 billion resort considered among the world’s most spectacular hotels. The architect was Jon Jerde of The Jerde Partnerships, and construction was handled by Mirage Resorts, Inc. When built, the Bellagio was the most expensive hotel in the world. In front of the hotel are the Fountains of Bellagio—shooting fountains choreographed to music that “dance” on the hotel’s 8.5 acre man-made lake—which are now considered Las Vegas landmarks. The Bellagio is credited with starting a new spree of luxurious developments in Las Vegas. Among these developments include The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and Paris Las Vegas.

Wynn brought Mirage Resorts’ style to Biloxi, Mississippi in 1999, where he oversaw development of the 1,835-room Beau Rivage. Themed to blend Mediterranean beauty with Southern hospitality, the resort was part of a building boom that established Biloxi as a regional tourism center along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. &quot;Beau Rivage&quot; was originally the name Wynn wanted to give the Bellagio, though he had decided on &quot;Bellagio&quot; after vacationing in the Italian region of the same name. Beau Rivage opened as the largest hotel-casino to be built outside Nevada. The casino was initially located on a series of floating barges as required by local law confining all casinos to mobile marine vessels at the time of the resort&#x27;s construction. The hotel, restaurants, and associated facilities were constructed on land.

The company was acquired in 2000 by MGM Grand Inc., which then changed its name to MGM Mirage, for $6.4 billion, including $2 billion in assumed debt, after an initial all-cash offer of $17 per share and a final offer of $21 per share. The company was majority owned by Wynn.

<doc id="270000" wikidata="Q1753214" url="?curid=270000" title="Labyrinth seal">
<text>A labyrinth seal is a type of mechanical seal that provides a tortuous path to help prevent leakage. An example of such a seal is sometimes found within an axle&#x27;s bearing to help prevent the leakage of the oil lubricating the bearing. 

A labyrinth seal may be composed of many grooves that press tightly inside another axle, or inside a hole, so that the fluid has to pass through a long and difficult path to escape. Sometimes screw threads exist on the outer and inner portion. These interlock, to produce the long characteristic path which slows leakage. For labyrinth seals on a rotating shaft, a very small clearance must exist between the tips of the labyrinth threads and the running surface. The &quot;teeth&quot; of the labyrinth seal may be on the rotating shaft (teeth on rotor - TOR) or on the stator (TOS), or both, in an interlocking configuration.

Labyrinth seals on rotating shafts provide non-contact sealing action by controlling the passage of fluid through a variety of chambers by centrifugal motion, as well as by the formation of controlled fluid vortices. At higher speeds, centrifugal motion forces the liquid towards the outside and therefore away from any passages. Similarly, if the labyrinth chambers are correctly designed, any liquid that has escaped the main chamber becomes entrapped in a labyrinth chamber, where it is forced into a vortex-like motion. This acts to prevent its escape, and also acts to repel any other fluid. Because these labyrinth seals are non-contact, they do not wear out.

Many gas turbine engines, having high rotational speeds, use labyrinth seals due to their lack of friction and long life. Because liquid-filled labyrinth seals still generate heat due to the viscosity of the seal oil, and because seal oil can contaminate the process fluids, modern high-performance gas turbines use dry gas seals which use spring-loaded rings with an inert gas in between the faces of the rings to provide the seal. This creates even lower friction and provides a liquid-free seal. However, such engines often have detectable oil leakage into the compression chamber. Indeed, many gas turbine engine seals leak by design.

Labyrinth seals are also found on pistons, which use them to store oil and seal against high pressure during compression and power strokes, as well as on non-rotating shafts. In these applications, it is the long and difficult path and the formation of controlled fluid vortices plus some limited contact-sealing action that creates the seal.

<text>Viriconium is a series of novels and stories written by English author M. John Harrison between 1971 and 1984, set in and around the fictional city of the same name. 

In the first novel in the series, the city of Viriconium exists in a future Earth littered with the technological detritus of millennia (partly inspired by Jack Vance&#x27;s &quot;Dying Earth&quot; series, Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;Gormenghast&quot; series and the poems of T. S. Eliot). However, variations of the city appear throughout the series (most frequently as Uriconium and Vriko), in an attempt by Harrison to subvert the concept of thoroughly mapped secondary worlds featured in certain works of fantasy, particularly those by J. R. R. Tolkien and his host of successors.

Both universal and in particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as &#x27;Uroconium&#x27; (though there does not seem to be any association with the old Roman town of Viroconium).

==&quot;The Pastel City&quot;==
The first Viriconium novel, &quot;The Pastel City&quot; (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. Harrison&#x27;s leading character, Lord tegeus-Cromis, fancies himself a better poet than swordsman; yet he leads the battle to save Viriconium, the Pastel City, from the brain-stealing automatons known as the &quot;geteit chemosit&quot; from Earth&#x27;s past. 

The decadence Harrison describes is reminiscent of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s vision of the far future in &quot;The End of All Songs&quot;. David Pringle wrote of the novel: &quot;This is a sword-and-sorcery tale, yet it borders on sf by virtue of its distant future setting and the conceit that most of the &#x27;magic&#x27; is in fact ancient, little-understood science. Despite its obvious debts to Jack Vance and Michael Moorcock, it&#x27;s a very moody and stylish entertainment.&quot; Reviewing the novel for &quot;Delap&#x27;s F &amp; SF&quot;, Michael Bishop opined that &quot;my own gut feeling is that M. John Harrison is wasting his time and his gift with this sort of material&quot; but that &quot;if you like elegantly crafted, elegantly written sword and sorcery, this book is all you could ask for.&quot;

==&quot;A Storm of Wings&quot;==

The more complex second novel of the Viriconium sequence, which is also borderline science fiction, is &quot;A Storm of Wings&quot; (1980). It is set eighty years later than &quot;The Pastel City&quot; and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate than the first novel. Fay Glass and Alstath Fulthor of the Reborn Men, awoken from their long sleep, try to alert the powers of Viriconium that the northern highlands are overrun by insectile armies. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Fay brings the severed head of an invading locust-like giant insect to show the extent of the disaster. The story is told through both human and alien points of view and perceptions. The main characters are a resurrected man, an assassin, a magician, a madwoman, and Tomb, the Iron Dwarf. Harrison depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer.

==&quot;In Viriconium&quot;==

The novel &quot;In Viriconium&quot; (1982) (US title: &quot;The Floating Gods&quot;) was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. Savoy Books catalogs referred to it as &quot;Pre-Raphaelite sword and sorcery&quot;. It is a moody portrait of Viriconium beset by a mysterious plague. As artist Audsley King slowly dies from the plague, her friend Ashlyme tries to save her. It is a desperate, misconceived enterprise which draws Ashlyme into unwilling alliance with the sinister dwarf The Grand Cairo, and which goes bizarrely wrong. Yet out of the shambles comes the clue to lifting the plague, which symbolises a paralysis of will. 

Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, &quot;In Viriconium&quot; goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair. The novel parodies Arthurian motifs. The novel is divided into sections named after cards of an imaginary Tarot. Resonances in the text include the art of Aubrey Beardsley, post-Impressionist art, Mervyn Peake and Wyndham Lewis.

==Short stories==

The short fiction of the Viriconium sequence replays the attrition of the novels; finally, in &quot;A Young Man&#x27;s Journey to Viriconium&quot; (later retitled &quot;A Young Man&#x27;s Journey to London&quot;), Viriconium has become little more than a dream.

Harrison has frequently used the Tarot as a motif in his work, as in &quot;Viriconium Nights&quot; (which is divided into sections named after cards of an imaginary Tarot) and in his story &quot;The Horse of Iron (and How We Can Know It and Be Changed by It Forever)&quot;. The collection &quot;Viriconium Nights&quot; consists of various stories (the number varies depending whether one considers the Ace 1984 edition or the Gollancz 1985 edition). All are vignettes of night life in the Pastel City.

In &quot;The Lamia and Lord Cromis&quot;, tegeus-Cromis (who recurs in &quot;Lords of Misrule&quot; and is the protagonist of &quot;The Pastel City&quot;), a dwarf, and a man named Dissolution Kahn travel to a poisonous bog to destroy a dangerous Lamia. The mission ends in confusion and despair.

In the story &quot;Viriconium Knights&quot;, the elderly swordsman Osgerby Practal is defeated in a duel by Ignace Retz, an unpopular servant of the Queen. Retz uses a power knife, a relic of previous times when high technology was used, but which is now ill understood; the badly-functioning power knife gives off floating motes which harm the wielder. (In this, Harrison invents his own variant of Moorcock&#x27;s soul-draining magic swords in the Elric stories). The Queen is the grotesque Mammy Vooley, whose &quot;body was like a long ivory pole about which they had draped the faded purple gown of her predecessor. On it was supported a very small head which looked as if had been partly scalped, partly burned, and partly starved to death in a cage suspended above the Gabelline Gate. One of her eyes was missing. She sat on an old carved wooden throne with iron wheels, in the middle of a tall limewashed room that had five windows.&quot; Retz has ambitions to seek treasure in the broad wastes south and west of Viriconium, and petitions the Queen to allow him to keep the power knife so he may defend himself against his enemies. When she refuses, he uses the knife to cut off her hand, and flees, hunted through the city by various factions of &quot;aristocratic thugs&quot; such as the Locust Clan and the Yellow Paper Men. Taking refuge in the house of an old man who shows him a strange tapestry, he beholds various visions of himself, seemingly at different periods in the city&#x27;s history, before trying to steal a metal eagle from the old man&#x27;s room. The metal eagle comes to life, attacking him, and Retz barely escapes. Later, he finds himself on a wasteland where some men are trying to bury a body with a fish-mask on its head. Retz steals the clothes and mask from the body and continues on his way.

In &quot;The Luck in the Head&quot;, in the Artists&#x27; Quarter, the poet Ardwick Crome has been having a recurring dream about a ceremony called &quot;the Luck in the Head.&quot; He wants these disturbing dreams to stop, so he goes looking for one of the women in the dream.

&quot;Strange Great Sins&quot; is the story of the weak and silly man Baladine Prinsep, who becomes enamored with the ballet dancer Vera Ghillera and wastes away. The story is told at one remove through the memories of his nephew, an unnamed sin-eater, and through those of his mother and of the singer Madame de Maupassant. In this story the motif of the Mari Lwyd is central. This story looks at the city of Viriconium from the perspective of outsiders who know that those who go there either are, or will become, decadent and self-absorbed.

In &quot;The Dancer From the Dance&quot; the ballerina Vera Ghillera from &quot;Strange Great Sins&quot; visits Allman&#x27;s Heath where strange things are afoot.

&quot;A Young Man&#x27;s Journey to Viriconium&quot;, set in our world, explains that Viriconium is a real place and tells you exactly how to get there, in case you want to go. The doorway is a mirror in a bathroom in a café in England.

&quot;Lords of Misrule&quot;, narrated in the first person by Harrison&#x27;s continuing character Lord Cromis, deals with Cromis&#x27;s visit to a country house where the Yule Greave, formerly a fighter with the Feverfew Anschluss faction of Viriconium, and his wife, live with their young servant Ringmer. An unidentified enemy is gradually encroaching on the country lands and Cromis appears to be surveying their progress. During his visit, he is shown one of the ancient and highly decorated Mari - a version of the Mari Lwyd - used by the people in the &#x27;mast horse ceremony&#x27;, which Ringmer&#x27;s father used to operate.

The graphic novel &quot;The Luck in the Head&quot; adapts the short story of that name and is illustrated by Ian Miller.

A 1988 omnibus entitled &quot;Viriconium&quot; omits the first two novels; it consists of the third novel, &quot;In Viriconium&quot;, and the full contents of the short story collection &quot;Viriconium Nights&quot;. The stories in this omnibus are in the same running order as in the 1985 first edition. The omnibus has an introduction by Iain Banks.

All four works of the sequence were published in the U.K in a single omnibus volume called &quot;Viriconium&quot; in 2000.. The stories are arranged in a different sequence (presumably chronological) which see the &quot;Viriconium Nights&quot; stories in a different running order than in the 1985 first edition and the 1988 omnibus. An American edition of all four was published in 2005, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman. The novels are sequenced in publication order, but the short stories are in a different sequence. This edition was published in audio in late 2011 by Neil Gaiman Presents, read by Simon Vance.

<text>John Walters (11 July 1939 – 30 July 2001) was a British radio producer, presenter and musician. Initially a schoolteacher and a jazz enthusiast, he played trumpet in The Mighty Joe Young Jazz Men and the 1960s pop group The Alan Price Set before joining BBC Radio 1 in 1967, where he was John Peel&#x27;s producer from 1969 to 1991.

==Biography==
Walters was born in Long Eaton, near Nottingham. He read Fine Arts at Durham University, where he worked under Victor Pasmore and as a student had his paintings exhibited alongside the works of David Hockney. He then taught at a comprehensive in Kenton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, wrote a jazz column for the Newcastle &quot;Journal&quot;, gave evening classes in jazz history, played the trumpet with local bands and met Alan Price, then organist with the Animals. When Price quit to form his own group, Walters was recruited. He featured on five of the Alan Price Set&#x27;s British hits, and played the Albert Hall and the Paris Olympia.

Walters joined the fledgling BBC Radio 1 in 1967 as a staff producer. He soon linked up with DJ John Peel and became his producer, starting in 1969. As a producer for Peel, he turned down the Sex Pistols for a &quot;Peel session&quot; when, drawing on his experience as a schoolteacher, he said Johnny Rotten &quot;didn&#x27;t look like the kind of boy you would trust to give out the scissors&quot;. He reportedly regretted this decision later, but was responsible for getting The Smiths their first session after witnessing an early concert. He was also responsible for The Fall&#x27;s first session, a group which would later become Peel&#x27;s favourite. Walters and Peel became close friends, with Walters being Peel&#x27;s best man when he married his wife Sheila, and Peel requesting Walters play Roy Harper&#x27;s &quot;When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease&quot; as his on-air memorial song if Peel were to die before Walters.

Walters also produced Vivian Stanshall&#x27;s first foray into radio, both by overseeing Stanshall&#x27;s &quot;Rawlinson End Radio Flashes&quot; when Stanshall stood in for a vacationing John Peel, and Stanshall&#x27;s &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot;. He presented the long-running Radio 1 arts magazine &quot;Walters&#x27; Weekly&quot;, as well as &quot;Loose Ends&quot; and &quot;Idle thoughts&quot;, and was heard reviewing the music papers on the Janice Long show in the 1980s. In the 1990s, he was a reporter on the BBC&#x27;s current affairs magazine &quot;Here and Now&quot;.

Walters died suddenly on 30 July 2001, from a heart attack, at the age of 62. He was survived by his wife, Helen.

<doc id="270005" wikidata="Q6028353" url="?curid=270005" title="Ineffable cardinal">
<text>In the mathematics of transfinite numbers, an ineffable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number, introduced by . In the following definitions, formula_1 will always be a regular uncountable cardinal number.

A cardinal number formula_1 is called almost ineffable if for every formula_3 (where formula_4 is the powerset of formula_1) with the property that formula_6 is a subset of formula_7 for all ordinals formula_8, there is a subset formula_9 of formula_1 having cardinality formula_1 and homogeneous for formula_12, in the sense that for any formula_13 in formula_9, formula_15.

A cardinal number formula_1 is called ineffable if for every binary-valued function formula_17, there is a stationary subset of formula_1 on which formula_12 is homogeneous: that is, either formula_12 maps all unordered pairs of elements drawn from that subset to zero, or it maps all such unordered pairs to one. An equivalent formulation is that a cardinal formula_1 is ineffable if for every sequence formula_22 such that each formula_23, 
there is formula_24 such that formula_25 is stationary in .

Another equivalent formulation is that a regular uncountable cardinal formula_1 is ineffable if for every set formula_9 of cardinality formula_1 of subsets of formula_1, there is a normal (i.e. closed under diagonal intersection) non-trivial formula_1-complete filter formula_31 on formula_1 deciding formula_9: that is, for any formula_34, either formula_35 or formula_36. This is similar to a characterization of weakly compact cardinals.

More generally, formula_1 is called formula_38-ineffable (for a positive integer formula_38) if for every formula_40 there is a stationary subset of formula_1 on which formula_12 is formula_38-[[Homogeneous (large cardinal property)|homogeneous]] (takes the same value for all unordered formula_38-tuples drawn from the subset). Thus, it is ineffable if and only if it is 2-ineffable. Ineffability is strictly weaker than 3-ineffability.p. 399

A totally ineffable cardinal is a cardinal that is formula_38-ineffable for every formula_46. If formula_1 is formula_48-ineffable, then the set of formula_38-ineffable cardinals below formula_1 is a stationary subset of formula_1.

Every formula_38-ineffable cardinal is formula_38-almost ineffable (with set of formula_38-almost ineffable below it stationary), and every formula_38-almost ineffable is formula_38-subtle (with set of formula_38-subtle below it stationary). The least formula_38-subtle cardinal is not even weakly compact (and unlike ineffable cardinals, the least formula_38-almost ineffable is formula_60-describable), but formula_61-ineffable cardinals are stationary below every formula_38-subtle cardinal.

A cardinal κ is completely ineffable if there is a non-empty formula_63 such that
- every formula_64 is stationary
- for every formula_64 and formula_17, there is formula_67 homogeneous for &quot;f&quot; with formula_68.

Using any finite formula_38 &gt; 1 in place of 2 would lead to the same definition, so completely ineffable cardinals are totally ineffable (and have greater consistency strength). Completely ineffable cardinals are formula_70-indescribable for every &quot;n&quot;, but the property of being completely ineffable is formula_71.

The consistency strength of completely ineffable is below that of 1-iterable cardinals, which in turn is below remarkable cardinals, which in turn is below ω-Erdős cardinals. A list of large cardinal axioms by consistency strength is available in the section below.

<text>Postal service in the United States began with the delivery of stampless letters whose cost was borne by the receiving person, later encompassed pre-paid letters carried by private mail carriers and provisional post offices, and culminated in a system of universal prepayment that required all letters to bear nationally issued adhesive postage stamps.

In the earliest days, ship captains arriving in port with stampless mail would advertise in the local newspaper names of those having mail and for them to come collect and pay for it, if not already paid for by the sender. Postal delivery in the United States was a matter of haphazard local organization until after the Revolutionary War, when eventually a national postal system was established. Stampless letters, paid for by the receiver, and private postal systems, were gradually phased out after the introduction of adhesive postage stamps, first issued by the U.S. government post office July 1, 1847, in the denominations of five and ten cents, with the use of stamps made mandatory in 1855.

The issue and use of adhesive postage stamps continued during the 19th century primarily for first-class mail. Each of these stamps generally bore the face or bust of an American president or another historically important statesman. However, once the Post Office realized during the 1890s that it could increase revenues by selling stamps as &quot;collectibles&quot;, it began issuing commemorative stamps, first in connection with important national expositions, later for the anniversaries of significant American historical events. Continued technological innovation subsequently prompted the introduction of special stamps, such as those for use with airmail, zeppelin mail, registered mail, certified mail, and so on. Postage due stamps were issued for some time and were pasted by the post office to letters having insufficient postage with the postage due to be paid to the postal carrier at the receiving address.

Today, many stamps issued by the post office are self-adhesive, and no longer require that the stamps be &quot;licked&quot; to activate the glue on their back. In many cases, post office clerks now use Postal Value Indicators (PVI), which are computer labels, instead of stamps.

Where for a century-and-a-half or so, stamps were almost invariably denominated with their values (5 cent, 10 cent, etc.) the United States post office now sells non-denominated &quot;forever&quot; stamps for use on first-class and international mail. These stamps are still valid for the full rate even if there is a rate increase. However, for other uses, adhesive stamps with denomination indicators are still available and sold.

==Early postal history==
Postal services began in the first half of the 17th century serving the first American colonies of Britain and France; today, the United States Postal Service is a large government organization providing a wide range of services across the United States and its territories abroad.
In the American colonies, informal independently-run postal routes began in Boston as early as 1639, with Boston to New York City service starting in 1672. Courier service began between Montreal and Quebec City by 1693, and likely occurred earlier, as Pedro da Silva, a courier, had arrived more than 20 years before that. (This area of New France would join Britain’s other American colonies in 1763 as Quebec.)

Officially sanctioned mail service began in 1692 when King William III granted to an English nobleman a delivery &quot;patent&quot; that included the exclusive right to establish and collect a formal postal tax on official documents of all kinds. Years later, in 1765, taxation implemented through the mandatory purchase of stamps (embossed directly on documents or embossed on paper and affixed to them) was an issue that helped to spark the American Revolution. The tax was repealed a year later, and few were ever actually used in the colonies, but they were sold, including in Nova Scotia and the British Caribbean islands.

In the years leading up to the American Revolution, mail routes among the colonies existed along the few roads between Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Montreal, Trois Rivieres, and Quebec City. Halifax stationer Benjamin Leigh started postal service in Nova Scotia by 1754. The following year, the British post office inaugurated a monthly packet run from Britain to New York, an attempt to improve military communications. From New York, any available ships carried mail to port cities, including Halifax. In the middle 18th century, individuals like Benjamin Franklin and William Goddard were the colonial postmasters who managed the mails then, and were the general architects of a postal system that started out as an alternative to the Crown Post (the colonial mail system then) which became more distrusted as the American Revolution drew near. The postal system that Franklin and Goddard forged out of the American Revolution became the standard for the new U.S. Post Office and is a system whose basic designs are still used in the United States Postal Service today.

==Post offices and postmarks==

In 1775, when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first Postmaster General, the U.S. Post Office was born. So important was the Postmaster General that in 1829 this position was included among those in the President&#x27;s Cabinet. As America began to grow and new towns and villages began to appear, so too did the Post Office along with them. The dates and postmarks generated from these places often have provided the historian with a window into a given time and place. Each postmark is unique with its own name of state and town, in addition to its distinctive date.

Post offices that existed along railroad lines and at various military posts have their own special historical aspect. Mail and postmarks generated from prisoner-of-war camps during the Civil War, or from aboard naval ships, each with a U.S. Post Office aboard, can and have offered insights into United States history and are avidly sought after by historians and collectors alike.

Between 1874 and 1976 post offices were categorized from first to fourth classes based on the amount of revenue they generated, with first being the highest.

==Mail before postage stamps==
Before the introduction of stamps, it was the recipient of mail—not the sender—who generally paid the cost of postage, giving the fee directly to the postman on delivery. The task of collecting money for letter after letter greatly slowed the postman on his route. Moreover, the addressee would at times refuse a piece of mail, which then had to be taken back to the post office (post office budgets always allowed for an appreciable volume of unpaid-for mail). Only occasionally did a sender pay delivery costs in advance, an arrangement that usually required a personal visit to the post office. To be sure, postmasters allowed some citizens to run charge accounts for their delivered and prepaid mail, but bookkeeping on these constituted another inefficiency.

Postage stamps revolutionized this process, leading to universal prepayment; but a precondition for their issue by a nation was the establishment of standardized rates for delivery throughout the country. If postal fees were to remain (as they were in many lands) a patchwork of many different jurisdictional rates, the use of stamps would only produce limited gains in efficiency, for postal clerks would still have to spend time calculating the rates on many letters: only then would senders know how much postage to put on them.

==Provisional issue stamps==
The introduction of postage stamps in the UK in May 1840 was received with great interest in the United States (and around the world). Later that year, Daniel Webster rose in the U.S. Senate to recommend that the recent English postal reforms—standardized rates and the use of postage stamps—be adopted in America.

It would be private enterprise, however, that brought stamps to the U.S. On February 1, 1842, a new carrier service called &quot;City Despatch Post&quot; began operations in New York City, introducing the first adhesive postage stamp ever produced in the western hemisphere, which it required its clients to use for all mail. This stamp was a 3¢ issue bearing a rather amateurish drawing of George Washington, printed from line engraved plates in sheets of 42 images. The company had been founded by Henry Thomas Windsor, a London merchant who at the time was living in Hoboken, New Jersey. Alexander M. Greig was advertised as the post&#x27;s &quot;agent&quot;, and as a result, historians and philatelists have tended to refer to the firm simply as &quot;Greig&#x27;s City Despatch Post&quot;, making no mention of Windsor. In another innovation, the company placed mail-collection boxes around the city for the convenience of its customers.

A few months after its founding, the City Despatch Post was sold to the U.S. government, which renamed it the &quot;United States City Despatch Post&quot;. The government began operation of this local post on August 16, 1842, under an Act of Congress of some years earlier that authorized local delivery. Greig, retained by the Post Office to run the service, kept the firm&#x27;s original Washington stamp in use, but soon had its lettering altered to reflect the name change. In its revised form, this issue accordingly became the first postage stamp produced under the auspices of a government in the western hemisphere.

An Act of Congress of March 3, 1845 (effective July 1, 1845), established uniform (and mostly reduced) postal rates throughout the nation, with a uniform rate of five cents for distances under 300 miles (500 km) and ten cents for distances between 300 and 3,000 miles. However, Congress did not authorize the production of stamps for nationwide use until 1847; still, postmasters realized that standard rates now made it feasible to produce and sell &quot;provisional&quot; issues for prepayment of uniform postal fees, and printed these in bulk. Such provisionals included both prepaid envelopes and stamps, mostly of crude design, the New York Postmaster&#x27;s Provisional being the only one of quality comparable to later stamps.

The provisional issues of Baltimore were notable for the reproduced signature of the city&#x27;s postmaster—James M. Buchanan (1803–1876), a cousin to President James Buchanan. All provisional issues are rare, some inordinately so: at a Siegel Gallery auction in New York in March 2012, an example of the Millbury provisional fetched $400,000, while copies of the Alexandria and Annapolis provisionals each sold for $550,000. Eleven cities printed provisional stamps in 1845 and 1846:
* Alexandria, Virginia (&quot;ALEXANDRIA POST OFFICE&quot; in circle)
* Annapolis, Maryland (eagle in circle)
* Baltimore, Maryland (James Buchanan signature)
* Boscawen, New Hampshire (&quot;PAID / 5 / CENTS&quot;)
* Brattleboro, Vermont (shaded box with postmaster initials inside)
* Lockport, New York (&quot;LOCKPORT N.Y.&quot; in oval)
* Millbury, Massachusetts (woodcut of George Washington)
* New Haven, Connecticut (&quot;POST OFFICE&quot; in box, P.M. signature)
* New York, New York (&quot;POST OFFICE&quot; over Washington portrait)
* Providence, Rhode Island (&quot;POST OFFICE / PROV. R.I.&quot; in shaded box)
* St. Louis, Missouri (St. Louis Bears, Missouri coat of arms)
(See also: A Gallery of U. S. Postmasters&#x27; Provisional Stamps, 1845-47.)

The 1845 Congressional act did, in fact, raise the rate on one significant class of mail: the so-called &quot;drop letter&quot;—i. e., a letter delivered from the same post office that collected it. Previously one cent, the drop letter rate became two cents.

==First national postage stamps==
Congress finally provided for the issuance of stamps by passing an act on March 3, 1847, and the Postmaster-General immediately let a contract to the New York City engraving firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch, and Edson. The first stamp issue of the U.S. was offered for sale on July 1, 1847, in New York City, with Boston receiving stamps the following day and other cities thereafter. They consisted of an engraved 5-cent red brown stamp depicting Benjamin Franklin (the first postmaster of the U.S.), and a 10-cent value in black with George Washington. Like all U.S. stamps until 1857, they were imperforate.

The 5-cent stamp paid for a letter weighing less than 1/2 ounce and traveling up to 300 miles, the 10-cent stamp for deliveries to locations greater than 300 miles, or, twice the weight deliverable for the 5-cent stamp. Each stamp was hand engraved in what is believed to be steel, and laid out in sheets of 200 stamps. The 5-cent stamp is often found today with very poor impressions because the type of ink used contained small pieces of quartz that wore down the steel plates used to print the stamp. On the other hand, most 10-cent stamps are of strong impressions.

The use of stamps was optional: letters could still be sent requiring payment of postage on delivery. Indeed, the post office did not issue any 2-cent value for prepaying drop letters in 1847, and these continued to be handled as they had been. Nevertheless, many Americans took up using stamps; about 3,700,000 of the 5¢ and about 865,000 of the 10¢ were sold, and enough of those have survived to ensure a ready supply for collectors, although the demand is such that a very fine 5¢ sells for around $500 as of 2020, and the 10¢ in very fine condition, face-free stamped cancellation, with four well-spaced borders, sells for $1,500 or more in used form. Unused stamps are much scarcer, fetching around $3,000 and $20,000 respectively, if in very fine condition.

The post office had become so efficient by 1851 that Congress was able to reduce the common rate to three cents (which remained unchanged for over thirty years), necessitating a new issue of stamps. Moreover, the common rate now applied to letters carried up to 3000 miles. This rate, however, only applied to prepaid mail: a letter sent without a stamp still cost the recipient five cents—clear evidence that Congress envisioned making stamp use mandatory in the future (it did so in 1855). The 1-cent drop-letter rate was also restored, and Post Office plans did not at first include a stamp for it; later, however, an essay for a 6-cent Franklin double-weight stamp was converted into a drop-letter value. Along with this 1¢ stamp, the post office initially issued only two additional denominations in the series of 1851: 3¢ and 12¢, the three stamps going on sale that July and August. Since the 1847 stamps no longer conformed to any postal rate, they were declared invalid after a short period during which the public could exchange old stamps for new ones. Within a few years the Post Office found that stamps in the old denominations were needed after all, and so, added a 10¢ value to the series in 1855, followed by a 5¢ stamp the following year. The full series included a 1¢ profile of Franklin in blue, a 3¢ profile of Washington in red brown, a 5¢ portrait of Thomas Jefferson, and portraits of Washington for 10¢ green and 12¢ black values. The 1¢ stamp achieved notoriety, at least among philatelists, because production problems (the stamp design was too tall for the space provided) led to a welter of plate modifications done in piecemeal fashion, and there are no fewer than seven major varieties, ranging in price from $100 to $200,000 (the latter for the only stamp of the 200 images on the first plate that displays the design&#x27;s top and bottom ornamentation complete).

1857 saw the introduction of perforation, and in 1860 24¢, 30¢ and 90¢ values (with still more images of Washington and Franklin) were issued for the first time. These higher denominations, especially the 90¢ value, were available for such a short time (a little over a year) that they had virtually no chance of being used. The 90¢ stamp used is a very rare item, and so frequently forged that authorities counsel collectors to shun cancelled copies that lack expert certification.

In February 1861, a congressional act directed that &quot;cards, blank or printed ... shall also be deemed mailable matter, and charged with postage at the rate of one cent an ounce.&quot; Private companies soon began issuing post cards, printed with a rectangle in the top right corner where the stamp was to be affixed. (The Post Office would not produce pre-stamped &quot;postal cards&quot; for another dozen years.)

The issue was declared invalid for postage in May 1861, as the Confederate States had supplies of them. Therefore, stamps used after that date usually have the marking &quot;OLD STAMPS/NOT RECOGNIZED&quot; on the cover.

==Issues of the Civil War era==
The outbreak of the American Civil War threw the postal system into turmoil. On April 13, 1861 (the day after the firing on Fort Sumter), John H. Reagan, postmaster-general of the Confederate States of America, ordered local postmasters to return their U.S. stamps to Washington, D.C. (although it is unlikely that many did so), while in May the Union decided to withdraw and invalidate all existing U.S. stamps, and to issue new stamps. Confederate post offices were left without legitimate stamps for several months, and while many reverted to the old system of cash payment at the post office, over 100 post offices across the South came up with their own provisional issues. Many of these are quite rare. Eventually, the Confederate government issued its own stamps; see stamps and postal history of the Confederate States.

In the North, the new stamp designs became available in August, and old stamps were accepted in exchange, with different deadlines for replacement set for different regions of the country, first ranging from September 10 to November 1, later modified to November 1 to January 1, 1862. The whole process was very confusing to the public, and there are a number of covers from 1862 and later with 1857 stamps and bearing the marking &quot;OLD STAMPS NOT RECOGNIZED&quot;.

The 1861 stamps had in common the letters &quot;U S&quot; in their design. To make them differentiable from the older stamps at a glance, all were required to have their values expressed in Arabic numerals (in the previous series, Arabic numerals had appeared only on the 30¢ stamp). The original issue included all the denominations offered in the previous series: 1¢, 3¢, 5¢, 10¢, 12¢, 24¢, 30¢ and 90¢ stamps. Numerals apart, several of these are superficially similar to their earlier counterparts—particularly because Franklin, Washington and Jefferson still appear on the same denominations as previously.

A 2¢ stamp in black featuring Andrew Jackson was issued in 1863 and is now known to collectors as the &quot;Black Jack&quot;. A black 15¢ stamp depicting the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln was issued in 1866, and is generally considered part of the same series. While it was not officially described as such, and the 15¢ value was chosen to cover newly established fee for registered letters, some philatelists consider this to be the first memorial stamp ever issued.

The war greatly increased the amount of mail in the North; ultimately about 1,750,000,000 copies of the 3¢ stamp were printed, and a great many have survived to the present day, typically selling for 2-3 dollars apiece. Most are rose-colored; pink versions are much rarer and quite expensive, especially the &quot;pigeon blood pink&quot;.

The stamps of the 1861 series, unlike those of the two previous issues, remained valid for postage after they had been superseded—as has every subsequent United States stamp.

===Pony Express===
In 1860, the U.S. Post Office incorporated the services of the Pony Express to get mail to and from San Francisco, an important undertaking with the outbreak of the Civil War, as a communication link between Union forces and San Francisco and the West Coast was badly needed. The Pony Express Trail from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California, was 1,840 miles long. Upon arrival in Sacramento, the U.S. mail was placed on a steamer and continued down the Sacramento River to San Francisco for a total of 1,966 miles. The Pony Express was a short-lived enterprise, remaining in operation for only 18 months. Consequently, there is little surviving Pony Express mail today, only 250 examples known in existence.

===Encased postage stamps===

Widespread hoarding of coins during the Civil War created a shortage, prompting the use of stamps for currency. To be sure, the fragility of stamps made them unsuitable for hand-to-hand circulation, and to solve this problem, John Gault invented the encased postage stamp in 1862. A normal U. S. stamp was wrapped around a circular cardboard disc and then placed inside a coin-like circular brass jacket. A transparent mica window in the jacket allowed the face of the stamp to be seen. All eight denominations available in 1861–62, ranging from 1 cent to 90 cents, were offered in encased versions. Raised lettering on the metal backs of the jackets often advertised the goods or services of business firms; these included the Aerated Bread Company; Ayer&#x27;s Sarsaparilla and Cathartic Pills; Burnett&#x27;s Cocoaine; Sands Ale; Drake&#x27;s Plantation Bitters; Buhl &amp; Co. Hats and Furs; Lord &amp; Taylor; Tremont House, Chicago; Joseph L. Bates Fancy Goods; White the Hatter, New York City; and Ellis McAlpin &amp; Co. Dry Goods, Cincinnati. (See also: Fractional currency.)

==Grills==
During the 1860s, the postal authorities became concerned about postage stamp reuse. While there is little evidence that this occurred frequently, many post offices had never received any canceling devices. Instead, they improvised a canceling process by scribbling on the stamp with an ink pen (&quot;pen cancellation&quot;), or whittling designs in pieces of cork, sometimes very creatively (&quot;fancy cancels&quot;), to mark the stamps. However, since poor-quality ink could be washed from the stamp, this method would only have been moderately successful. A number of inventors patented various ideas to attempt to solve the problem.

The Post Office eventually adopted the grill, a device consisting of a pattern of tiny pyramidal bumps that would emboss the stamp, breaking up the fibers so that the ink would soak in more deeply, and thus be difficult to clean off. While the patent survives (No. 70,147), much of the actual process of grilling was not well documented, and there has been considerable research trying to recreate what happened and when. Study of the stamps shows that there were eleven types of grill in use, distinguished by size and shape (philatelists have labeled them with letters A-J and Z), and that the practice started sometime in 1867 and was gradually abandoned after 1871. A number of grilled stamps are among the great rarities of US philately. The United States 1¢ Z grill was long thought to be the rarest of all U.S. stamps, with only two known to exist. In 1961, however, it was discovered that the 15¢ stamp of the same series also existed in a Z grill version; this stamp is just as rare as the 1¢, for only two examples of the 15¢ Z grill are known. Rarer still may be the 30¢ stamp with the I Grill, the existence of which was discovered only recently: as of October 2011, only one copy is known.

==1869==
In 1868, the Post Office contracted with the National Bank Note Company to produce new stamps with a variety of designs. These came out in 1869, and were notable for the variety of their subjects; the 2¢ depicted a Pony Express rider, the 3¢ a locomotive, the 12¢ the steamship &quot;Adriatic&quot;, the 15¢ the landing of Christopher Columbus, and the 24¢ the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Other innovations in what has become known as the 1869 Pictorial Issue included the first use of two-color printing on U.S. stamps, and as a consequence the first invert errors. Although popular with collectors today, the unconventional stamps were not very popular among a population that was accustomed to postage that bore classic portrayals of Washington, Franklin and other forefathers.

==Bank notes==

The postage stamps issued in the 1870s and 1880s are collectively known as the &quot;Bank Notes&quot; because they were produced by the National Bank Note Company, the Continental Bank Note Company, then the American Bank Note Company. After the 1869 fiasco with pictorial stamp issues, the new Postmaster-General decided to base a series of stamps on the &quot;heads, in profile, of distinguished deceased Americans&quot; using &quot;marble busts of acknowledged excellence&quot; as models. George Washington was returned to the normal-letter-rate stamp: he had played that role in the issues of 1851 and 1861 and would continue to do so in every subsequent definitive set until the Presidential Series of 1938. But the large banknotes did not represent a total retreat to past practices, for the range of celebrated Americans was widened beyond Franklin and various presidents to include notables such as Henry Clay and Oliver Hazard Perry. Moreover, while images of statesmen had provided the only pictorial content of pre-1869 issues, the large banknotes did not entirely exclude other representative images. Two denominations of the series accompanied their portraits with iconographic images appropriate to the statesmen they honored: rifles, a cannon and cannonballs appeared in the bottom corners of the 24-cent issue devoted to General Winfield Scott, while the 90-cent stamp framed Admiral Oliver Perry within a nautically hitched oval of rope and included anchors in the bottom corners of its design. National first printed these, then in 1873 Continental received the contract—and the plates that National used. Continental added secret marks to the plates of the lower values, distinguishing them from the previous issues. The American Bank Note Company acquired Continental in 1879 and took over the contract, printing similar designs on softer papers and with some color changes. Major redesigning, however, came only in 1890, when the American Bank Note Company issued a new series in which stamp-size was reduced by about 10% (the so-called &quot;Small Bank Notes&quot;).

In 1873, the Post Office began producing a pre-stamped post card. One side was printed with a Liberty-head one-cent stamp design, along with the words &quot;United States Postal Card&quot; and three blank lines provided for the mailing address. Six years later, it introduced a series of seven Postage Due stamps in denominations ranging from 1¢ to 50¢, all printed in the same brownish-red color and conforming to the same uniform and highly utilitarian design, with their denominations rendered in numerals much larger than those found on definitive stamps. The design remained unchanged until 1894, and only four different postage-due designs have appeared to date.

In 1883, the first-class letter rate was reduced from 3¢ to 2¢, prompting a redesign of the existing 3¢ green Washington stamp, which now became a 2¢ brown issue.

===Special Delivery===

In 1885 the Post Office established a Special Delivery service, issuing a ten-cent stamp depicting a running messenger, along with the wording &quot;secures immediate delivery at a special delivery office.&quot; Initially, only 555 such offices existed but the following year all U. S. Post Offices were obliged to provide the service—an extension not, however, reflected on the Special Delivery stamp until 1888, when the words &quot;at any post office&quot; appeared on its reprint. (On stamps of future years, the messenger would be provided the technological enhancements of a bicycle [1902] a motorcycle [1922] and a truck [1925]. Although the last new U.S. Special Delivery stamp appeared issued in 1971, the service was continued until 1997, by which time it had largely been supplanted by Priority Mail delivery, introduced in 1989.) The 1885 Special Delivery issue was the first U.S. postage stamp designed in the double-width format. Eight years later, this shape would be chosen for the Columbian Exposition commemoratives, as it offered appropriate space for historical tableaux. The double-width layout would subsequently be employed in many United States Commemoratives.

==Columbian issue==

The World Columbian Exposition of 1893 commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. The Post Office got in on the act, issuing a series of 16 stamps depicting Columbus and episodes in his career, ranging in value from 1¢ to $5 (a princely sum in those days). They are often considered the first commemorative stamps issued by any country.

The stamps were interesting and attractive, designed to appeal to not only postage stamps collectors but to historians, artists and of course the general public who bought them in record numbers because of the fanfare of the Columbian Exposition of the World&#x27;s Fair of 1892 in Chicago, Illinois.

They were quite successful (a great contrast to the pictorials of 1869), with lines spilling out of the nation&#x27;s post offices to buy the stamps. They are prized by collectors today with the $5 denomination, for example, selling for between $1,500 to $12,500 or more, depending upon the condition of the stamp being sold.

Another release in connection with the Columbian series was a reprint of the 1888 Special Delivery stamp, now colored orange (reportedly, to prevent postal clerks from confusing it with the 1¢ Columbian). After sales of the series ceased, the Special Delivery stamp reappeared in its original blue.

==Bureau issues==

Also during 1893, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing competed for the postage stamp printing contract, and won it on the first try. For the postage issues of the 1894 series, the Bureau took over the plates of the 1890 small banknote series but modified them by adding triangles to the upper corners of the designs. Three new designs were needed, because the Post Office elected to add $1, $2 and $5 stamps to the series (previously, the top value of any definitive issue had been 90¢). On many of the 1894 stamps, perforations are of notably poor quality, but the Bureau would soon make technical improvements. In 1895 counterfeits of the 2¢ value were discovered, which prompted the BEP to begin printing stamps on watermarked paper for the first time in U.S. postal history. The watermarks imbedded the logo U S P S into the paper in double-lined letters. The Bureau&#x27;s definitive issues of the 1890s consisted of 13 different denominations ranging from 1 cent to 5 dollars, and may be differentiated by the presence or absence of this watermark, which would appear on all U. S. Postage stamps between 1895 and 1910. The final issue of 1898 altered the colors of many denominations to bring the series into conformity with the recommendations of the Universal Postal Union (an international body charged with facilitating the course of transnational mail). The aim was to ensure that in all its member nations, stamps for given classes of mail would appear in the same colors. Accordingly, U.S. 1¢ stamps (postcards) were now green and 5¢ stamps (international mail) were now blue, while 2¢ stamps remained red. (As a result, it was also necessary to replace the blue and green on higher values with other colors.) U.S. postage continued to reflect this color-coding quite strictly until the mid-1930s, continuing also in the invariable use of purple for 3¢ stamps.

==Start of the 20th century==

In 1898, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition opened in Omaha, Nebraska, and the Post Office was ready with the Trans-Mississippi Issue. The nine stamps were originally to be two-toned, with black vignettes surrounded by colored frames, but the BEP, its resources overtaxed by the needs of the Spanish–American War, simplified the printing process, issuing the stamps in single colors. They were received favorably, though with less excitement than the Columbians; but like the Columbians, they are today prized by collectors, and many consider the $1 &quot;Western Cattle in Storm&quot; the most attractive of all U.S. stamps.
Collectors, still smarting from the expense of the Columbian stamps, objected that inclusion of $1 and $2 issues in the Trans-Mississippi series presented them with an undue financial hardship. Accordingly, the next stamp series commemorating a prominent exposition, the Pan-American Exposition held in Buffalo, New York in 1901, was considerably less costly, consisting of only six stamps ranging from in value 1¢ to 10¢. The result, paradoxically, was a substantial increase in Post Office profits; for, while the higher valued Columbians and Trans-Mississippis had sold only about 20,000 copies apiece, the public bought well over five million of every Pan-American denomination. In the Pan-American series the Post Office realized the plan for two-toned stamps that it had been obliged to abandon during the production of the Trans-Mississippi issue. Upside-down placement of some sheets during the two-stage printing process resulted in the so-called Pan-American invert errors on rare copies of the 1¢, 2¢ and 4¢ stamps.

==Definitive issues of 1902–1903==

The definitive stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1902–1903 were markedly different in their overall designs from the regular definitive stamps released over the previous several decades. Among the prominent departures from tradition in these designs was that the names of the subjects were printed out, along with their years of birth and death. (Printed names and birth and death dates are more typically a feature of Commemorative stamps.) Unlike any definitive stamps ever issued before, the 1902–03 issues also had ornate sculptural frame work redolent of Beaux-Arts architecture about the portrait, often including allegorical figures of different sorts, with several different types of print used to denote the country, denominations and names of the subjects. This series of postage stamps were the first definitive issues to be entirely designed and printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and their Baroque revival style is much akin to that of the Pan-American commemoratives the Bureau had issued in 1901. There are fourteen denominations ranging from 1-cent to 5-dollars. The 2-cent George Washington stamp appeared with two different designs (the original version was poorly received) while each of the other values has its own individual design. This was the first U.S. definitive series to include the image of a woman: Martha Washington, who appeared on the 8-cent stamp.

==Commemorative issues, 1904–1907==
In these years, the postal service continued to produce commemorative sets in conjunction with important national expositions. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904 prompted a set of five stamps, while a trio of stamps commemorated the Jamestown Exposition, held in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1907.

==Washington-Franklin era==

1908 saw the beginning of the long-running Washington-Franklin series of stamps. Although there were only two central images, a profile of Washington and one of Franklin, many subtle variants appeared over the years; for the Post Office experimented with half-a-dozen different perforation sizes, two kinds of watermarking, three printing methods, and large numbers of values, all adding to several hundred distinct types identified by collectors. Some are quite rare, but many are extremely common; this was the era of the postcard craze, and almost every antique shop in the U.S. will have some postcards with green 1¢ or red 2¢ stamps from this series. In 1910 the Post Office began phasing out the double-lined watermark, replacing it by the same U S P S logo in smaller single-line letters. Watermarks were discontinued entirely in 1916.

Toward the beginning of the Washington-Franklin era, in 1909, the Post Office issued its first individual commemorative stamps—three single 2¢ issues honoring, respectively, the Lincoln Centennial, the Alaska-Yukon Exposition, and the tercentennial/centennial Hudson-Fulton Celebration in New York. A four-stamp series commemorating the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California appeared in 1913, but no further commemoratives were issued until after World War I. The Lincoln Centennial&#x27;s portrait format distinguished it from all other commemoratives released between 1893 and 1926, which were produced exclusively in landscape format. (The next U. S. commemorative in portrait orientation would be the Vermont Sesquicentennial issue of 1927, and many have appeared since.)
It was also in 1913, in January, that the Post Office introduced domestic parcel post service (a belated development, given that international parcel post service between the United States and other countries began in 1887). A series of twelve Parcel Post stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912, ranging in denomination from 1¢ to $1. All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and Fruit Growing. Five green Parcel Post Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently. It soon became obvious that none of these stamps was needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one denomination introduced in the Parcel Post series—20¢—had proved useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin issues in 1914, along with a 30¢ stamp.

On November 3, 1917, the normal letter rate was raised from 2¢ to 3¢ in support of the war effort. The rate hike was reflected in the first postwar commemorative—a 3¢ &quot;victory&quot; stamp released on March 3, 1919 (not until July 1 would postal fees return to peacetime levels). Only once before (with the Lincoln Memorial issue of 1909) had the Post Office issued a commemorative stamp unconnected to an important national exposition; and the appearance of the Pilgrim Tercentenary series in 1920 confirmed that a new policy was developing: the Post Office would no longer need the pretext of significant patriotic trade fairs to issue commemoratives: they could now freely produce stamps commemorating the anniversaries of any notable historical figures, organizations or events.

In 1918, the post office printed its second two color stamp, featuring the Curtiss JN-4 airplane. The initial version released on May 10, 1918, contained the image of the plane printed upside-down in error. Only a sheet of 100 of this error is known to exist, which was broken up into smaller pieces and resold. The stamp became known as the Inverted Jenny. It is one of the most popular stamp errors in US history. Since 2007, several copies have sold for over $1 million USD in auctions.

==The 1920s and 1930s==

The stamps of the 1920s were dominated by the Series of 1922, the first new design of definitive stamps to appear in a generation. The lower values mostly depicted various presidents, with the 5c particularly intended as a memorial of the recently deceased Theodore Roosevelt, while the higher values included an &quot;American Indian&quot; (Hollow Horn Bear), the Statue of Liberty, Golden Gate (without the bridge, which had yet to be built), Niagara Falls, a bison, the Lincoln Memorial and so forth. Higher values of the series (from 17¢ through $5) were differentiated from the cheaper stamps by being designed in horizontal (landscape) rather than vertical format, an idea carried over from the &quot;big Bens&quot; of the Washington-Franklin series.

Stamp printing was switching from a flat plate press to a rotary press while these stamps were in use, and most come in two perforations as a result; 11 for flat plate, and 11x10.5 for rotary. In 1929, theft problems in the Midwest led to the Kansas-Nebraska overprints on the regular stamps. (See also: Fourth Bureau issue).

From 1924 on, commemorative stamps appeared every year. The 1920s saw several 150th anniversaries connected with the American Revolutionary War, and several stamps were issued in connection with those. These included the first U.S. souvenir sheet, for the Battle of White Plains sesquicentennial, and the first overprint, reading &quot;MOLLY / PITCHER&quot;, the heroine of the Battle of Monmouth.

===Two Cent Red Sesquicentennial issues of 1926–1932===
During this period, the U.S. Post Office issued more than a dozen &#x27;Two Cent Reds&#x27; commemorating the 150th anniversaries of Battles and Events that occurred during the American Revolution. The first among these was the Liberty Bell 150th Anniversary Issue of 1926, designed by Clair Aubrey Huston, and engraved by J.Eissler &amp; E.M.Hall, two of America&#x27;s most renowned master engravers. The &#x27;Two Cent Reds&#x27; were among the last stamps used to carry a letter for 2 cents, the rate changing to 3 cents on July 6, 1932. The rate remained the same for 26 years until it finally changed to 4 cents in 1958. 
===&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; stamps===

The German zeppelins were of much interest during this period, and in 1930 the department issued special stamps to be used on the Pan-American flight of &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;.

Although the &quot; Graf Zeppelin&quot; stamps are today highly prized by collectors as masterpieces of the engraver&#x27;s art, in 1930 the recent stock market crash meant that few were able to afford these stamps (the $4.55 value for the set represented a week&#x27;s food allowance for a family of four). Less than 10 percent of the 1,000,000 of each denomination issued were sold and the remainder were incinerated (the stamps were only available for sale to the public from April 19, 1930, to June 30, 1930). It is estimated that less than 8 percent of the stamps produced survive today and they remain the smallest U.S. issue of the 20th century (only 229,260 of these stamps were ever purchased, and only 61,296 of the $2.60 stamps were sold). 

===Washington bicentennial issue===
In 1932, a set of 12 stamps was issued to celebrate George Washington&#x27;s 200th birthday 1932 Washington Bicentennial. For the 2¢ value, which satisfied the normal letter rate, the most familiar Gilbert Stuart image of Washington had been chosen. After postal rates rose that July, this 2¢ red Washington was redesigned as a 3¢ stamp and issued in the purple color that now became ubiquitous among U.S. commemoratives. 

===The New Deal Era===

In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt became president. He was notable not only as an avid collector in his own right (with a collection estimated at around 1 million stamps) but also for taking an interest in the stamp issues of the department, working closely with Postmaster James Farley, the former Democratic Party Committee Chairman. Many designs of the 1930s were inspired or altered according to Roosevelt&#x27;s advice. In 2009–10, the National Postal Museum exhibited six Roosevelt sketches that were developed into stamp issues: the 6-cent eagle airmail stamp and five miscellaneous commemoratives, which honored the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, the Mothers of America, Susan B. Anthony, Virginia Dare, and the Northwest Territories rise to statehood. A steady stream of commemoratives appeared during these years, including a striking 1934 issue of ten stamps presenting iconic vistas of ten National Parks—a set that has remained widely beloved. (In a memorable sequence from Philip Roth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;, the young protagonist dreams that his National Parks stamps, the pride, and joy of his collection, have become disfigured with swastika overprints.) Choosing an orange color for the 2¢ Grand Canyon tableau instead of the standard 2¢ carmine red, the Post Office departed from U. P. U. color-coding for the first time. 

With a philatelist in the White House, the Post Office catered to collectors as never before, issuing seven separate souvenir sheets between 1933 and 1937. In one case, a collectors&#x27; series had to be produced as the result of a miscalculation. Around 1935, Postmaster Farley removed sheets of the National Parks set from stock before they had been gummed or perforated, giving these and unfinished examples of ten other issues to President Roosevelt and Interior Secretary Harold Ickes (also a philatelist) as curiosities for their collections. When word of these gifts got out, public outcries arose. Some accused Farley of a corrupt scheme to enrich Roosevelt and Ickes by creating valuable rarities for them at taxpayer expense. Stamp aficionados, in turn, demanded that these curiosities be sold to the public so that ordinary collectors could acquire them, and Farley duly issued them in bulk. This series of special printings soon became known as &quot;Farley&#x27;s Follies&quot;. As the decade progressed, the purples used for 3¢ issues, although still ostensibly conforming to the traditional purple, displayed an increasingly wide variety of hues, and one 1940 issue, a 3¢ stamp commemorating the Pony Express, dispensed with purple entirely, appearing in a rust brown earth tone more suitable to the image of a horse and rider departing from a western rural post office. 

===Presidential Issue of 1938===
The famous Presidential Issue, known as &quot;Prexies&quot; for short, came out in 1938. The series featured all 29 U.S. presidents through Calvin Coolidge, each of whom appeared in profile as a small sculptural bust. Values of 50¢ and lower were mono-colored; on the $1, $2, and $5 stamps the presidents&#x27; images were printed in black on white, surrounded by colored lettering and ornamentation. Up through the 22¢ Cleveland stamp, the denomination assigned to each president corresponds to his position in the presidential roster: thus the first president, Washington, is on the 1¢ value, the seventeenth, Andrew Johnson, is on the 17¢ value, etc. Additional stamps depict Franklin (½¢), Martha Washington (1½¢), and the White House (4½¢). Many of the values were included merely to place the presidents in proper numerical order and did not necessarily correspond to a postal rate; and one of the (difficult) games for Prexie collectors is to find a cover with, for instance, a single 16¢ stamp that pays a combination of rate and fees valid during the Prexies&#x27; period of usage. Many such covers remain to be discovered; some sellers on eBay have been surprised to discover an ordinary-seeming cover bid up to several hundred dollars because it was one of the sought-after solo usages. The Presidential issue remained in distribution for many years. Not until 1954 did the Post Office begin replacing its values with the stamps of a new definitive issue, the Liberty series. 

==Famous Americans Series of 1940==

In 1940, the U.S. Post Office issued a set of 35 stamps, issued over the course of approximately ten months, commemorating America&#x27;s famous authors, poets, educators, scientists, composers, artists and inventors. The educators included Booker T. Washington, became the first African-American to be honored on a U.S. stamp. This series of postage issues was printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. These stamps were larger in size than normal definitive issues, with only 280 stamp images contained on the printing plate (400 images was standard for the Presidential series). Notable also is the red-violet color chosen for the 3¢ stamps, a brighter hue than the traditional purple.

==World War II==

During World War II, production of new U. S. 3¢ commemorative stamps all but ceased. Among the three issues that appeared in 1942 was the celebrated Win the War stamp, which enjoyed enormously wide use, owing partly to patriotism and partly to the relative unavailability of alternatives. It presents an art deco eagle posed in a &quot;V&quot; shape for victory surrounded by 13 stars. The eagle is grasping arrows, but has no olive branch.

In 1942, the first U.S. stamp to feature a foreign language was issued. The five-cent stamp commemorated the alliance between the United States and China. Under portraits of Abraham Lincoln and Sun Yat-sen, the stamp has a map of China and the slogan &quot;Fight the War and Build the Country&quot; in Chinese. The ceremony commemorating its release was attended by Franklin D. Roosevelt and T. V. Soong.

A notable commemorative set appeared in 1943–44, but its stamps, all valued at 5 cents, were not competitive with the Win the War issue. This was the Overrun Countries series (known to collectors as the Flag set), produced as a tribute to the thirteen nations that had been occupied by the Axis Powers.

The thirteen stamps present full color images of the national flags of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Austria, Denmark, and Korea, with the names of the respective countries written beneath. To the left of each flag appears the image of the phoenix, which symbolizes the renewal of life, and to its right appears a kneeling female figure with arms raised, breaking the shackles of servitude.

The stamps with flags of European countries were released at intervals from June to December 1943, while the Korea flag stamp was released in November 1944.
These stamps were priced at 5 cents, although the standard cost for a first-class stamp was 3 cents. These stamps were intended for use on V-mail, a means whereby mail intended for military personnel overseas was delivered with certainty.

The service persons overseas used the same method for writing letters home, and the same process was used to reconstruct their letters, except that their postage was free.

The two-cent surcharge on the V-mail letters helped pay for the additional expense of this method of delivery.

Because of the elaborate process necessary for the full-color printing, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing contracted with a private firm, the American Bank Note Company, to produce the series - the first U. S. stamps to be printed by a private company since 1893. Uniquely among U. S. issues, the sheets lack the plate numbers usually printed on the selvage surrounding the stamps. In the places where the numbers normally appear on each sheet, the name of the country is substituted, engraved in capital letters.

==Post-World War II==

The post-World War II stamp program followed a consistent pattern for many years: a steady stream of commemorative issues sold as single stamps at the first-class letter rate. While the majority of these were designed in the double-width format, an appreciable number issued in honor of individuals conformed instead to the format, size, general design style, and red-violet hue used in the 1940 Famous Americans series.

The Postal Service had become increasingly lax about employing purple for 3¢ stamps, and after the war, departures from that color in double-width commemoratives veritably became the rule rather than the exception (although U. P. U. colors and purple for 3¢ stamps would continue to be used in the definitive issues of the next decades). Beginning in 1948, Congressional Representatives and Senators began to push the Post Office for stamps proposed by constituents, leading to a relative flood of stamps honoring obscure persons and organizations. The stamp issue did not again become well regulated until the formation of the Citizens&#x27; Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC) in 1957. 
The Liberty issue of 1954, deep in the Cold War, took a much more political slant than previous issues. The common first-class stamp was a 3¢ Statue of Liberty in purple, and included the inscription &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, the first explicit religious reference on a U.S. stamp (ten days before the issue of the 3¢ Liberty stamp, the words &quot;under God&quot; had been inserted into the Pledge of Allegiance). The Statue of Liberty appeared on two additional higher values as well, 8¢ and 11¢, both of which were printed in two colors. The other stamps in the series included liberty-related statesmen and landmarks, such as Patrick Henry and Bunker Hill, although other subjects, (Benjamin Harrison, for example) seem unrelated to the basic theme.

In 1957, the American Flag was featured on a U. S. stamp for the first time. The Post Office had long avoided this image, fearing accusations that, in issuing stamps on which they would be defacing the flag by cancellation marks, they would be both committing and fomenting desecration. However, protests against this initial flag issue were muted, and the flag has remained a perennially popular U. S. stamp subject ever since.

The 3¢ rate for first-class had been unchanged since 1932, but by 1958 there were no more efficiency gains to keep the lid on prices, and the rate went to 4¢, beginning a steady series of rate increases that reached 49¢ as of January 26, 2014.
From 1957 to 1961 the U.S. post office issued the Champion of Liberty series of stamps, consisting of nineteen commemorative stamps issued periodically. The stamps featured various men who fought for freedom and independence in their home countries and are considered &quot;Champions of Liberty&quot;. Issued during the Cold War these stamps also served as a counter-point to the perceived totalitarianism of the Soviet Union.

The Prominent Americans series superseded the &quot;Liberties&quot; in the 1960s and proved the last definitive issue to conform to the Universal Postal Union color code. In the 1970s, they were replaced by the Americana series, in which colors became purely a matter of designer preference.
In 1971, the Post Office was reorganized in accordance with the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, becoming the United States Postal Service (USPS). However, it is still heavily regulated, with, for instance, the CSAC continuing to decide which commemorative stamps to issue.

The Bicentennial Series began with the issuance of a stamp showing the logo for the Bicentennial celebrations in 1971 and concluded in 1983.

In January 1973, the USPS began to issue &quot;Love&quot; stamps for use on Valentine&#x27;s Day and other special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries and letters to loved ones. The first such issue was an 8 cents stamp that the Postal Service initially titled &quot;Special Stamp for Someone Special&quot;. The stamp was based on a pop art image that Robert Indiana had designed during the 1960s (see &quot;Love&quot; sculpture). The 1973 issue had a printing production of 320 million stamps.

==Air Mail==

Airmail in the United States Post Office emerged in three stages beginning with the &#x27;pioneer period&#x27; where there were many unofficial flights carrying the mail prior to 1918, the year the US Post Office assumed delivery of all Air Mail. The US Post office began contracting out to the private sector to carry the mail (Contract Air Mail, CAM) on February 15, 1926. In 1934, all US Air Mail was carried by the U.S. Army for six months, after which the contract system resumed.
==Abraham Lincoln postage issues==
In 1866, about a year after Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, the U.S. Post Office issued its first postage stamp honoring the fallen President. The Post Office stated that the release took place on June 17. Some sources, however, believe that the stamp was introduced on April 14, the one-year anniversary of Lincoln&#x27;s death, and one notable expert made an (unverifiable) claim that the stamp first saw use on April 15. In any case, it is considered by some as America&#x27;s first commemorative stamp. From that point on Lincoln&#x27;s portrait appeared on a variety of U.S. postage stamps and today exists on more than a dozen issues. Lincoln is also honored on commemorative stamps issued by Costa Rica and Nicaragua. With the exceptions of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, Lincoln appears on US Postage more than any other famous American.

==Modern U.S. stamps==

The first self-adhesive stamp was a 10 cent stamp from the Christmas issue of 1974. It was not considered successful, and the surviving stamps, though not rare, are all gradually becoming discolored due to the adhesive used. Self-adhesives were not issued again until 1989, gradually becoming so popular that , only a handful of types are offered with the traditional gum (now affectionately called &quot;manual stamps&quot; by postal employees).

The increasing frequency of postal rate increases from the 1970s on, and the necessity to wait for these to be approved by Congress, made it problematic for the Postal Service to provide stamps matching the increased costs in a timely manner. Until it was known, for example, whether the new first-class rate would be 16¢ or, instead, 15¢, no denominated stamp could be printed. The Postal Service found a way to bypass this problem in 1978. Preparatory to that year&#x27;s increase, an orange colored stamp with a simple eagle design appeared bearing the denomination &quot;A&quot; instead of a number; and the public was informed that this stamp would satisfy the new first-class rate, whatever it turned out to be. Subsequent rate increases resulted in B, C and D stamps, which bore the same eagle design but were printed, respectively, in purple, buff-brown and blue-green. When it came time for an E stamp in 1987, the Postal Service commissioned a more elaborate design: a color picture of the globe as seen from space (E for Earth). Rises since have prompted F for Flower, G for Old Glory and H for Hat stamps, all appropriately illustrated. The F stamp in 1991 was accompanied by an undenominated &quot;make-up&quot; stamp with no pictorial design beyond a frame, which enclosed the words &quot;This U. S. stamp, along with 25¢ of additional U. S. postage, is equivalent to the &#x27;F&#x27; stamp rate.&quot;

The Great Americans series and the Transportation coils began appearing in 1980 and 1981, respectively. The transportation coils were used steadily for some 20 years, while Great Americans was replaced by the Distinguished Americans series, which began in 2000.

The increasing use of email and other technologies during the 1990s led to a decline in the amount of first-class mail, while bulk mail increased. A large variety of commemorative stamps continue to appear, but more of them just go to collectors, while the stamps of the average person&#x27;s daily mail are non-denominated types issued specifically for businesses.

The first US postage stamp to incorporate microprinting as a security feature was the American Wildflower Series introduced by the United States Postal Service in 1992. It was also the first commemorative stamp to be wholly produced by offset lithography. The USPS has since issued other stamps with more complex microprinting incorporated along with dates, words, and abbreviations such as &quot;USPS&quot; and even entire stamp designs composed of microprint letters.

The first US stamp to officially honor a black American was issued in 1940, featuring Booker T. Washington. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1978 did the USPS started the Black Heritage series, the first stamp featuring Harriet Tubman. As of today, the Black Heritage series is the longest running U.S. stamp series.

In 1994, the USPS released a sheet of stamps titled Legends of the West, which contained an error. It featured a misidentification, portraying African-American rodeo performer Bill Pickett&#x27;s younger brother, Ben Pickett, instead of Bill himself. The stamps were recalled and reprinted with the correct photo, but due to the demand of the collectors and to recoup some of the printing revenue lost, the post office released 150,000 of the stamp sheets by lottery.

In 2005, after 111 years of producing American postage stamps, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ended its involvement with the postal service.

On April 12, 2007, the Forever stamp went on sale for 41 cents, and is good for mailing one-ounce First-Class letters anytime in the future—regardless of price changes. On the same day, the Postal Service also issued an American flag stamp with the text &quot;USA First Class&quot;, whose value is fixed at 41 cents. In 2011, the Post Office began issuing all new stamps for First-Class postage—both definitives and commemoratives—as Forever stamps: denominations were no longer included on them. Beginning in 2015, the Post Office made all other stamps Forever stamps-Postcard, Additional Ounce, Two Ounce, Three Ounce, and Non-Machinable Surcharge, and these types of stamps now have their use printed on them instead of a number.

On February 25, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 2–1 that Frank Gaylord, sculptor of a portion of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, was entitled to compensation when an image of that sculpture was used on a 37-cent postage stamp because he had not signed away his intellectual property rights to the sculpture when it was erected. The appeals court rejected arguments that the photo was transformative. In 2006 sculptor Frank Gaylord enlisted Fish &amp; Richardson to make a pro bono claim that the Postal Service had violated his Intellectual property rights to the sculpture and thus should have been compensated. The Postal Service argued that Gaylord was not the sole sculptor (saying he had received advice from federal sources—who recommended that the uniforms appear more in the wind) and also that the sculpture was actually architecture. Gaylord won all of his arguments in the lower court except for one: the court ruled the photo was fair use and thus he was not entitled to compensation. Gaylord appealed and won the case on appeal. In 2011, the US Court of Federal Claims awarded Gaylord $5,000. On appeal, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the order and remanded the case back to the US Court of Federal Claims and in September 2013, the US Court of Federal Claims awarded Gaylord more than $600,000 in damages.

Later in the 2010s, automated stamp and bank automatic teller machines began dispensing thinner stamps. The thin stamps were to make it easier for automated stamp machines to dispense and to make the stamps more environmentally friendly.

On January 26, 2014, the postal service raised the price of First-class postage stamps to 49 cents. Rates for other mail, including postcards and packages, also increased.

Starting in 2005, the USPS offered customers the ability to design and purchase custom stamps, which were offered through third-party providers, like Stamps.com and Zazzle. The USPS prohibited certain types of images (such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, weapons, controlled substances, political content, religious content, violent content, or sexual content) from being used on the custom stamps. The rules generated some controversy by uneven enforcement of the rules against the use of purportedly religious and political imagery. This eventually led to two lawsuits, &quot;Zukerman v. United States Postal Serv.&quot; and &quot;Fletcher v. United States Postal Serv.&quot; On June 9, 2020, the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in &quot;Zukerman v. United States Postal Serv.&quot; that the content rules did not meet the &quot;objective, workable standards&quot; test established in &quot;Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky&quot;. One week later, the USPS discontinued the custom stamp program.

===New stamps===
Twelve criteria for new stamps and postal stationery include that &quot;events of historical significance shall be considered for commemoration only on anniversaries in multiples of 50 years.&quot; For many years, these included the restriction that &quot;no postal item will be issued sooner than five years after the individual&#x27;s death,&quot; with an exception provided for stamps memorializing recently deceased U.S. Presidents. In September 2011, however, the postal service announced that, in an attempt to increase flagging revenues, stamps would soon offer images of celebrated living persons, chosen by the Committee in response to suggestions submitted by the public via surface mail and social networks on the Internet. The revised criterion reads: &quot;The Postal Service will honor living men and women who have made extraordinary contributions to American society and culture.&quot;

On June 14, 2008, in Washington, DC, the Postal Service issued the first set of 10 designs in the 42–cent Flags of Our Nation stamps. The stamps were designed by Howard E. Paine of Delaplane, Virginia. Five subsequent sets of ten stamps each had appeared by August 16, 2012, bringing the total of stamp designs to sixty. Sets nos. 3 and 4 were denominated 44-cents, while the final two sets appeared as Forever stamps.

In August 2014, former Postmaster General Benjamin F. Bailar complained that the USPS was &quot;prostituting&quot; its stamps by focusing on stamps centered on popular culture, not cultural icons. He claims that this is a move aimed at making up for the USPS&#x27; revenue shortage at the expense of the values of the stamp program.

<text>The corpus callosum (Latin for &quot;tough body&quot;), also callosal commissure, is a wide, thick nerve tract, consisting of a flat bundle of commissural fibers, beneath the cerebral cortex in the brain. The corpus callosum is only found in placental mammals. It spans part of the longitudinal fissure, connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres, enabling communication between them. It is the largest white matter structure in the human brain, about in length and consisting of 200–300 million axonal projections.

A number of separate nerve tracts, classed as subregions of the corpus callosum, connect different parts of the hemispheres. The main ones are known as the genu, the rostrum, the trunk or body, and the splenium.

==Structure==

The corpus callosum forms the floor of the longitudinal fissure that separates the two cerebral hemispheres. Part of the corpus callosum forms the roof of the lateral ventricles.

The corpus callosum has four main parts – individual nerve tracts that connect different parts of the hemispheres. These are the rostrum, the genu, the trunk or body, and the splenium. Fibres from the trunk and the splenium, known together as the tapetum (&quot;carpet&quot;), form the roof of each lateral ventricle.

The front part of the corpus callosum, towards the frontal lobes, is called the genu (&quot;knee&quot;). The genu curves downward and backward in front of the septum pellucidum, diminishing greatly in thickness. The lower, much thinner part is the rostrum and is connected below with the lamina terminalis, which stretches from the interventricular foramina to the recess at the base of the optic stalk. The rostrum is named for its resemblance to a bird&#x27;s beak.

The end part of the corpus callosum, towards the cerebellum, is called the splenium. This is the thickest part, and overlaps the tela choroidea of the third ventricle and the midbrain, and ends in a thick, convex, free border. Splenium translates as &quot;bandage&quot; in Greek.

The trunk of the corpus callosum lies between the splenium and the genu.

The callosal sulcus is a sulcus that separates the corpus callosum from the cingulate gyrus.

===Relations===
On either side of the corpus callosum, the fibers radiate in the white matter and pass to the various parts of the cerebral cortex; those curving forward from the genu into the frontal lobes constitute the forceps minor (also forceps anterior) and those curving backward from the splenium into the occipital lobes, the forceps major (also forceps posterior). Between these two parts is the main body of the fibers, which constitute the tapetum and extend laterally on either side into the temporal lobe, and cover in the central part of the lateral ventricle. The tapetum and anterior commissure share the function of connecting left and right temporal lobes.

The anterior cerebral arteries are in contact with the undersurface of the rostrum; they arch over the front of the genu and are carried along the trunk, supplying the front four-fifths of the corpus callosum.

===Neuronal fibers===
The size, amount of myelination, and density of the fibers in the subregions relate to the functions of the brain regions they connect. Myelination is the process of coating neurons with myelin, which helps the transfer of information between neurons. The process is believed to occur until an individual&#x27;s thirties with peak growth in the first decade of one&#x27;s life. Thinner, lightly myelinated fibers are slower conducting and they connect the association and prefrontal areas. Thicker and fast-conducting fibers connect the visual and motor areas.

The tractogram pictured shows the nerve tracts from six segments of the corpus callosum, providing linking of the cortical regions between the cerebral hemispheres. Those of the genu are shown in coral; of the premotor, green; of the sensory-motor, purple; of the parietal, pink; of the temporal, yellow; and of the splenium, blue.

Thinner axons in the genu connect the prefrontal cortex between the two halves of the brain; these fibers arise from a fork-like bundle of fibers from the tapetum, the forceps minor. Thicker axons in the trunk of the corpus callosum interconnect areas of the motor cortex, with proportionately more of the corpus callosum dedicated to supplementary motor regions including Broca&#x27;s area. The splenium communicates somatosensory information between the two halves of the parietal lobe and the visual cortex at the occipital lobe. These are the fibers of the forceps major.

A study of five- to eighteen-year-olds found a positive correlation between age and callosal thickness.

===Variation between sexes===
The corpus callosum and its relation to sex has been a subject of debate in the scientific and lay communities for over a century. Initial research in the early 20th century claimed the corpus to be different in size between men and women. That research was, in turn, questioned, and ultimately gave way to more advanced imaging techniques that appeared to refute earlier correlations. However, advanced analytical techniques of computational neuroanatomy developed in the 1990s showed that sex differences were clear, but confined to certain parts of the corpus callosum, and that they correlated with cognitive performance in certain tests. An MRI study found that the midsagittal corpus callosum cross-sectional area is, after controlling for brain size, on average, proportionately larger in females.

Using diffusion tensor sequences on MRI machines, the rate at which molecules diffuse in and out of a specific area of tissue, anisotropy can be measured and used as an indirect measurement of anatomical connection strength. These sequences have found consistent sex differences in human corpus callosal shape and microstructure: specifically, increased signal intensity and decreased fractional anisotropy in the female corpus callosum, as compared with that of the male. 

Analysis by shape and size has also been used to study specific three-dimensional mathematical relationships with MRIs, and have found consistent and statistically significant differences between sexes. Specific algorithms have found significant differences between the two sexes in over 70% of cases in one review.

A 2005 study on the sizes and structures of the corpus callosum in transgender people found it to be structurally more in line with their declared gender than their assigned sex. 

==Correlates of size with handedness==
One study reported that the front portion of the human corpus callosum was 0.75 cm2 or 11% larger in left-handed and ambidextrous people than right-handed people. This difference was evident in the anterior and posterior regions of the corpus callosum, but not in the splenium. However, a 2022 meta-analysis failed to confirm any substantial differences in the corpus callosum related to left vs. right- vs. mix-handedness. Others have instead suggested that the degree of handedness negatively correlates with the size of the corpus callosum, meaning that individuals who are capable of using both hands with dexterity would have the largest corpus callosum and vice versa for either left or right hand.

==Development==
The formation of the corpus callosum begins with the first midline crossing of pioneer axons around week 12 in the prenatal development of the human, or day 15 in the embryogenesis of the mouse.
==Clinical significance==
===Epilepsy===
The symptoms of refractory (difficult to treat) epilepsy can be reduced by cutting through the corpus callosum in an operation known as a corpus callosotomy lobotomy paralysis. This is usually reserved for cases in which complex or grand mal seizures are produced by an epileptogenic focus on one side of the brain, causing an interhemispheric electrical storm. The diagnostic work up for this procedure involves an electroencephalogram, MRI, PET scan, and evaluation by a neurologist, neurosurgeon, psychiatrist, and neuroradiologist before a partial lobotomy surgery can be considered.

===Failure to develop===

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a rare congenital disorder that is one of the most common brain malformations observed in human beings, in which the corpus callosum is partially or completely absent. ACC is usually diagnosed within the first two years of life, and may manifest as a severe syndrome in infancy or childhood, as a milder condition in young adults, or as an asymptomatic incidental finding. Initial symptoms of ACC usually include seizures, which may be followed by feeding problems and delays in holding the head erect, sitting, standing, and walking. Other possible symptoms may include impairments in mental and physical development, hand-eye coordination, and visual and auditory memory. Hydrocephaly may also occur. In mild cases, symptoms such as seizures, repetitive speech, or headaches may not appear for years. Some syndromes often associated with ACC include Aicardi syndrome, Andermann syndrome, Shapiro syndrome, and acrocallosal syndrome.

ACC is usually not fatal. Treatment usually involves management of symptoms, such as hydrocephaly and seizures, if they occur. Although many children with the disorder lead normal lives and have average intelligence, careful neuropsychological testing reveals subtle differences in higher cortical function compared to individuals of the same age and education without ACC. Children with ACC accompanied by developmental delay and/or seizure disorders should be screened for metabolic disorders.

In addition to agenesis of the corpus callosum, similar conditions are hypogenesis (partial formation), dysgenesis (malformation), and hypoplasia (underdevelopment, including too thin).

Other studies have also linked possible correlations between corpus callosum malformation and autism spectrum disorders.

Kim Peek, a savant and the inspiration behind the movie &quot;Rain Man&quot;, was found with agenesis of the corpus callosum, as part of FG syndrome.

===Other conditions===
Anterior corpus callosum lesions may result in akinetic mutism or anomic aphasia. See also:
* Alien hand syndrome
* Dyslexia without agraphia (seen with damage to splenium of corpus callosum)
* Marchiafava–Bignami disease - a degenerative disease characterised by loss of myelin and necrosis of the corpus callosum
* Multiple sclerosis with the Dawson&#x27;s fingers sign
* Reversible splenial lesion syndrome - a rare encephalopathy of unknown origin with a transient lesion in the splenium, mostly associated with infectious diseases. Now proposed to be included in a group of such lesions termed &quot;Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum&quot;.
* Septo-optic dysplasia
* Susac&#x27;s syndrome characterised by lesions as small holes in the corpus callosum

==History==
The first study of the corpus with relation to gender was by R. B. Bean, a Philadelphia anatomist, who suggested in 1906 that &quot;exceptional size of the corpus callosum may mean exceptional intellectual activity&quot; and that there were measurable differences between men and women. Perhaps reflecting the political climate of the times, he went on to claim differences in the size of the callosum across different races. His research was ultimately refuted by Franklin Mall, the director of his own laboratory.

Of more mainstream impact was a 1982 &quot;Science&quot; article by Holloway and Utamsing that suggested sex difference in human brain morphology, which related to differences in cognitive ability. &quot;Time&quot; published an article in 1992 that suggested that, because the corpus is &quot;often wider in the brains of women than in those of men, it may allow for greater cross-talk between the hemispheres—possibly the basis for women’s intuition.&quot;

Later publications in the psychology literature have raised doubt as to whether the anatomic size of the corpus is actually different. A meta-analysis of 49 studies since 1980 found that, contrary to de Lacoste-Utamsing and Holloway, no sex difference could be found in the size of the corpus callosum, whether or not any account was taken of larger male brain size. A study in 2006 using thin slice MRI showed no difference in thickness of the corpus when accounting for the size of the subject.

==Other animals==
The corpus callosum is found only in placental mammals, while it is absent in monotremes and marsupials, as well as other vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Other groups do have other brain structures that allow for communication between the two hemispheres, such as the anterior commissure, which serves as the primary mode of interhemispheric communication in marsupials, and which carries all the commissural fibers arising from the neocortex (also known as the neopallium), whereas in placentals, the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers.

In primates, the speed of nerve transmission depends on the degree of myelination, or lipid coating. This is reflected by the diameter of the nerve axon. In most primates, axonal diameter increases in proportion to brain size to compensate for the increased distance to travel for neural impulse transmission. This allows the brain to coordinate sensory and motor impulses. However, the scaling of overall brain size and increased myelination have not occurred between chimpanzees and humans. This has resulted in the human corpus callosum&#x27;s requiring double the time for interhemispheric communication as a macaque&#x27;s. The fibrous bundle at which the corpus callosum appears can and does increase to such an extent in humans that it encroaches upon and wedges apart the hippocampal structures.

<text>Stuttgart Airport () formerly is an international airport serving Stuttgart, the capital of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is christened in honor of Stuttgart&#x27;s former mayor, Manfred Rommel, son of Erwin Rommel, and is the sixth busiest airport in Germany with 11,832,634 passengers having passed through its doors in 2018. The facility covers approximately 400 hectares (1,000 acres), of which 190 hectares are green space.

The airport is operated by Flughafen Stuttgart GmbH (FSG). It goes back to Luftverkehr Württemberg AG, which was founded in 1924 and initially operated Böblingen Airport. Since 2008, 65% of the operating company is owned by the state of Baden-Württemberg and 35% by the city of Stuttgart. It is located approximately ( in a straight line) south of Stuttgart and lies on the boundary between the nearby town of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Filderstadt and Stuttgart itself. In 2007, the Messe Stuttgart convention center – the ninth biggest exhibition centre in Germany – moved to grounds directly next to the airport. Additionally, the global headquarters for car parking company APCOA Parking are located here.

==History==
===Early years and World War II===
The airport was built in 1939 to replace Böblingen Airport. In 1945, the United States Army took over the airport until returning it to German authorities in 1948.

For the duration of the Cold War the runway and facilities were shared with the United States Army who operated helicopters, the Grumman OV-1 Mohawk and other fixed wing aircraft as &quot;Echterdingen Army Airfield&quot; on the southern portion of the airfield. Some of the units operating at Echterdingen were headquartered at nearby Nellingen Kaserne- now closed and redeveloped. In 1984–5, the 223rd Aviation Battalion (Combat) of the 11th Aviation Group (Combat) was headquartered at Echterdingen, with three aviation companies assigned (one at Schwäbisch Hall). The U.S. Army still maintains a small helicopter base - &quot;Stuttgart Army Airfield&quot; - on the southern side of the airport, which it shares with the Baden-Württemberg Police helicopter wing. The police helicopter wing falls under the control of Stuttgart Police Department and has six modern helicopters based at Stuttgart and two in Söllingen.

===The airport in the 1950s-1990s===
The airport was expanded after World War II. The runway was extended to in 1948, then to in 1961 and finally to in 1996. Renovation was scheduled for 2020, full closure phase was preponed to be completed in April during the corona lockdown.

The original 1938 terminal was finally replaced in 2004 and there are now four terminals with a maximum capacity of approximately 12 million passengers.

Politicians, town planners and nearby residents have been arguing for years about the construction of a second runway. However, on 25 June 2008, Minister-President Günther Oettinger announced that for the next 8–12 years no second runway will be built and that the restrictions for night operations stay in place.

===Development since 2010===
After the death of former mayor Manfred Rommel in November 2013 local politicians proposed renaming the airport after him. This proposal caused public disputes as he was the son of Erwin Rommel but also highly respected for his work on intercultural affairs. In July 2014, it has been announced that the airport will be named &quot;Flughafen Stuttgart - Manfred Rommel Flughafen&quot; from now on. In September 2016, the airport unveiled new branding and corporate design, changing its official name from &quot;Flughafen Stuttgart&quot; to &quot;Stuttgart Airport&quot;.

In September 2014, United Airlines cancelled their route to Stuttgart from Newark due to insufficient demand leaving Stuttgart Airport with only one remaining long-haul connection to Atlanta provided by Delta Air Lines.

In October 2014, easyJet announced they would serve Stuttgart as their seventh German destination by March 2015. In December 2014, Ryanair also added Stuttgart as a destination in their network with six weekly flights to Manchester from April 2015.

Air Berlin announced the start of a service to Abu Dhabi from December 2014. On 31 May 2016, Air Berlin ceased its flights to Abu Dhabi. In October 2016, Air Berlin announced it would close its maintenance facilities at the airport due to cost cutting and restructuring measures.

In July 2020, Lauda announced the closure of their base at Stuttgart Airport – which has been operated as a wetlease for Ryanair — by October 2020. Prior to this announcement, the base staff rejected a new labour agreement.

In August 2024, Delta Air Lines announced the end of their flights to Stuttgart from Atlanta after already having reduced their service to a seasonal one in March 2023. This marked the end of the connection after 36 years (with a three-year hiatus from 2020 to 2023 due to COVID-19) and will deprive the airport of any scheduled long-haul destinations.

==Terminals==

Stuttgart Airport consists of four passenger terminals which have separate check-in facilities and entrances but are directly connected to each other and share a single airside area which features eight jet bridges as well as about two dozen bus-boarding stands.

* Terminal 1 is the first of two landside main halls and features together with its addition Terminal 1-West 50 check-in counters. It shares the roof with Terminals 2 and 3 and is mainly used by Eurowings and Turkish Airlines.
* Terminal 2 is a small area featuring nine check-in counters and a security checkpoint. It is located within the shopping area between the main halls of Terminals 1 and 3. It is used by Lufthansa &amp; Star Alliance partners in addition to their counters in Terminal 1.
* Terminal 3 is the second of the two landside main halls east of Terminal 1 and 2 and features 39 additional check-in counters. It is used by TUIfly and KLM among several other airlines.
* Terminal 4 is, unlike the other three terminals, a separate and very basic equipped building to the east of Terminals 1 to 3 but also connected to them by a walk way. It features 17 more check-in counters as well as several bus-boarding gates and is used mostly for holiday charter operations. In March 2018, the airport administration announced that Terminal 4 will be entirely rebuilt and expanded in the coming years.

==Ground transportation==

===Car===

There are two major highways: Just north of the airport runs the Bundesautobahn 8 (A8), which connects the cities of Karlsruhe and Stuttgart to Ulm, Augsburg and Munich. The Bundesstraße 27 (B27) leads to downtown Stuttgart, as well as to Tübingen and Reutlingen in the South. 

===Coach===
From the regional cities of Esslingen am Neckar, Reutlingen, Tübingen and Kirchheim exists a connection by coach. Additionally, German long-distance coach operators &quot;DeinBus&quot; and Flixbus maintain their stop for Stuttgart on the airport grounds with direct connections to several major cities.

===Suburban railway===
Stuttgart Airport can be easily reached within 30 minutes from the city&#x27;s main railway station using the Stuttgart suburban railway S2 or S3 from Stuttgart Flughafen/Messe station.

===Future long-distance railway===
It is planned to connect the airport with the future Stuttgart - Ulm high-speed railway line currently under construction as part of the major Stuttgart 21 railway redevelopment program. Therefore, a new long-distance train station will be built on the airport&#x27;s grounds near the existing suburban railway station. The new station, which will be served by &quot;ICE&quot; high-speed trains will be connected to the new line by an underground loop track. The Stuttgart-Ulm line is scheduled to be opened in 2020. As of 2019, the airport connection is planned to commence operation in late 2025, versus an initial estimate of 2019 (made in 2010).
==Accidents and incidents==
* On 19 January 2010, Bin Air Swearingen SA-227-C Metro D-CKPP was damaged when the right main undercarriage collapsed on landing.

<doc id="270016" wikidata="Q65963433" url="?curid=270016" title="Angiotensin">
<text>Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. It is part of the renin–angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure. Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex to promote sodium retention by the kidneys.

An oligopeptide, angiotensin is a hormone and a dipsogen. It is derived from the precursor molecule angiotensinogen, a serum globulin produced in the liver. Angiotensin was isolated in the late 1930s (first named &#x27;angiotonin&#x27; or &#x27;hypertensin&#x27;, later renamed &#x27;angiotensin&#x27; as a consensus by the 2 groups that independently discovered it) and subsequently characterized and synthesized by groups at the Cleveland Clinic and Ciba laboratories.

== Precursor and types ==
=== Angiotensinogen ===

Angiotensinogen is an α-2-globulin synthesized in the liver and is a precursor for angiotensin, but has also been indicated as having many other roles not related to angiotensin peptides. It is a member of the serpin family of proteins, leading to another name: Serpin A8, although it is not known to inhibit other enzymes like most serpins. In addition, a generalized crystal structure can be estimated by examining other proteins of the serpin family, but angiotensinogen has an elongated N-terminus compared to other serpin family proteins. Obtaining actual crystals for X-ray diffractometric analysis is difficult in part due to the variability of glycosylation that angiotensinogen exhibits. The non-glycosylated and fully glycosylated states of angiotensinogen also vary in molecular weight, the former weighing 53 kDa and the latter weighing 75 kDa, with a plethora of partially glycosylated states weighing in between these two values.

Angiotensinogen is also known as renin substrate. It is cleaved at the N-terminus by renin to result in angiotensin I, which will later be modified to become angiotensin II. This peptide is 485 amino acids long, and 10 N-terminus amino acids are cleaved when renin acts on it. The first 12 amino acids are the most important for activity.

: Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Val-Ile-...

Plasma angiotensinogen levels are increased by plasma corticosteroid, estrogen, thyroid hormone, and angiotensin II levels. In mice with a full body deficit of angiotensinogen, the effects observed were low newborn survival rate, stunted body weight gain, stunted growth, and abnormal renal development.

=== Angiotensin I ===

:Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu | Val-Ile-...

Angiotensin I (CAS# 11128-99-7), officially called proangiotensin, is formed by the action of renin on angiotensinogen. Renin cleaves the peptide bond between the leucine (Leu) and valine (Val) residues on angiotensinogen, creating the decapeptide (ten amino acid) (des-Asp) angiotensin I. Renin is produced in the kidneys in response to renal sympathetic activity, decreased intrarenal blood pressure (&lt;90mmHg systolic blood pressure ) at the juxtaglomerular cells, dehydration or decreased delivery of Na+ and Cl- to the macula densa. If a reduced NaCl concentration in the distal tubule is sensed by the macula densa, renin release by juxtaglomerular cells is increased. This sensing mechanism for macula densa-mediated renin secretion appears to have a specific dependency on chloride ions rather than sodium ions. Studies using isolated preparations of thick ascending limb with glomerulus attached in low NaCl perfusate were unable to inhibit renin secretion when various sodium salts were added but could inhibit renin secretion with the addition of chloride salts. This, and similar findings obtained in vivo, has led some to believe that perhaps &quot;the initiating signal for MD control of renin secretion is a change in the rate of NaCl uptake predominantly via a luminal Na,K,2Cl co-transporter whose physiological activity is determined by a change in luminal Cl concentration.&quot;

Angiotensin I appears to have no direct biological activity and exists solely as a precursor to angiotensin II.

=== Angiotensin II ===
:Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe

Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II (AII) through removal of two C-terminal residues by the enzyme &quot;angiotensin-converting enzyme&quot; (ACE), primarily through ACE within the lung (but also present in endothelial cells, kidney epithelial cells, and the brain). Angiotensin II acts on the central nervous system to increase vasopressin production, and also acts on venous and arterial smooth muscle to cause vasoconstriction. Angiotensin II also increases aldosterone secretion; it therefore acts as an endocrine, autocrine/paracrine, and intracrine hormone.

ACE is a target of ACE inhibitor drugs, which decrease the rate of angiotensin II production. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by stimulating the Gq protein in vascular smooth muscle cells (which in turn activates an IP3-dependent mechanism leading to a rise in intracellular calcium levels and ultimately causing contraction). In addition, angiotensin II acts at the Na+/H+ exchanger in the proximal tubules of the kidney to stimulate Na+ reabsorption and H+ excretion which is coupled to bicarbonate reabsorption. This ultimately results in an increase in blood volume, pressure, and pH. Hence, ACE inhibitors are major anti-hypertensive drugs.

Other cleavage products of ACE, seven or nine amino acids long, are also known; they have differential affinity for angiotensin receptors, although their exact role is still unclear. The action of AII itself is targeted by angiotensin II receptor antagonists, which directly block angiotensin II AT1 receptors.

Angiotensin II is degraded to angiotensin III by angiotensinases located in red blood cells and the vascular beds of most tissues. Angiotensin II has a half-life in circulation of around 30 seconds, whereas, in tissue, it may be as long as 15–30 minutes.

Angiotensin II results in increased inotropy, chronotropy, catecholamine (norepinephrine) release, catecholamine sensitivity, aldosterone levels, vasopressin levels, and cardiac remodeling and vasoconstriction through AT1 receptors on peripheral vessels (conversely, AT2 receptors impair cardiac remodeling). This is why ACE inhibitors and ARBs help to prevent remodeling that occurs secondary to angiotensin II and are beneficial in congestive heart failure.

=== Angiotensin III ===

:Asp | Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe

Angiotensin III, along with angiotensin II, is considered an active peptide derived from angiotensinogen.

Angiotensin III has 40% of the pressor activity of angiotensin II, but 100% of the aldosterone-producing activity. Increases mean arterial pressure. It is a peptide that is formed by removing an amino acid from angiotensin II by glutamyl aminopeptidase A, which cleaves the N-terminal Asp residue.

Activation of the AT2 receptor by angiotensin III triggers natriuresis, while AT2 activation via angiotensin II does not. This natriuretic response via angiotensin III occurs when the AT1 receptor is blocked.

=== Angiotensin IV ===

:Arg | Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe

Angiotensin IV is a hexapeptide that, like angiotensin III, has some lesser activity. Angiotensin IV has a wide range of activities in the central nervous system.

The exact identity of AT4 receptors has not been established. There is evidence that the AT4 receptor is insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). There is also evidence that angiotensin IV interacts with the HGF system through the c-Met receptor.

Synthetic small molecule analogues of angiotensin IV with the ability to penetrate through blood brain barrier have been developed.

The AT4 site may be involved in memory acquisition and recall, as well as blood flow regulation. Angiotensin IV and its analogs may also benefit spatial memory tasks such as object recognition and avoidance (conditioned and passive avoidance). Studies have also shown that the usual biological effects of angiotensin IV on the body are not affected by common AT2 receptor antagonists such as the hypertension medication Losartan.

== Effects ==
:&quot;See also Renin–angiotensin system#Effects&quot;
Angiotensins II, III and IV have a number of effects throughout the body:

=== Adipic ===
Angiotensins &quot;modulate fat mass expansion through upregulation of adipose tissue lipogenesis ... and downregulation of lipolysis.&quot;

=== Cardiovascular ===

Angiotensins are potent direct vasoconstrictors, constricting arteries and increasing blood pressure. This effect is achieved through activation of the GPCR AT1, which signals through a Gq protein to activate phospholipase C, and subsequently increase intracellular calcium.

Angiotensin II has prothrombotic potential through adhesion and aggregation of platelets and stimulation of PAI-1 and PAI-2.

=== Neural ===

Angiotensin II increases thirst sensation (dipsogen) through the area postrema and subfornical organ of the brain, decreases the response of the baroreceptor reflex, increases the desire for salt, increases secretion of ADH from the posterior pituitary, and increases secretion of ACTH from the anterior pituitary. Some evidence suggests that it acts on the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) as well.

=== Adrenal ===
Angiotensin II acts on the adrenal cortex, causing it to release aldosterone, a hormone that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and lose potassium. Elevated plasma angiotensin II levels are responsible for the elevated aldosterone levels present during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

=== Renal ===
Angiotensin II has a direct effect on the proximal tubules to increase Na+ reabsorption. It has a complex and variable effect on glomerular filtration and renal blood flow depending on the setting. Increases in systemic blood pressure will maintain renal perfusion pressure; however, constriction of the afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles will tend to restrict renal blood flow. The effect on the efferent arteriolar resistance is, however, markedly greater, in part due to its smaller basal diameter; this tends to increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and maintain glomerular filtration rate. A number of other mechanisms can affect renal blood flow and GFR. High concentrations of Angiotensin II can constrict the glomerular mesangium, reducing the area for glomerular filtration. Angiotensin II is a sensitizer to tubuloglomerular feedback, preventing an excessive rise in GFR. Angiotensin II causes the local release of prostaglandins, which, in turn, antagonize renal vasoconstriction. The net effect of these competing mechanisms on glomerular filtration will vary with the physiological and pharmacological environment.

<text>Francesco Maria Guazzo, &quot;aka&quot; Guaccio, &quot;aka&quot; Guaccius (1570–16??) was an Italian priest. He is most well known for authoring the &quot;Compendium Maleficarum&quot;.

==Life and work==

He was a member of one of the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosian orders. These religious brotherhoods had appeared at various times since the 14th Century in and around the city of Milan and were quite plentiful, but the only one to attain more than simply local importance was the ‘&quot;Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus&quot;’ sometimes known as &#x27;The Brethren of the Grove&#x27;.

Before 1441 there were various monasteries that were canonically recognized under the name ‘Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ but there was little link between them. However, in 1441 Pope Eugene IV merged them into one congregation called ‘Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ of which Francesco Maria Guazzo was a member under the papacy of Pope Sixtus V and Pope Paul V.

Guazzo was highly regarded in the field of possessions and demonology and the cures thereof.

During his life he is credited with performing several exorcisms including to members of several ducal and princely families, notably the bewitched Cardinal Charles of Lorraine and his relative, Eric, Bishop of Verdun.

On another occasion Guazzo was called to Düsseldorf in order to exorcise the mad John William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (1562–1609). Guazzo first diagnosed possession, but after five months of unsuccessful attempts at spiritual healing and in the summer of 1604, the diagnosis was changed to bewitchment as the cause of the poor Duke’s mental illness. Guazzo had been sent to Düsseldorf by Duke Charles III of Lorraine (a family with which he had a long running association, having exorcised the Cardinal, Charles of Lorraine) on behalf of his daughter Antoinette (1569–1610), Duke Johann Wilhelm’s wife.

It was these direct experiences that inspired Guazzo to write his &quot;Compendium Maleficarum&quot; which was published in 1608 and was widely regarded among his contemporaries as the authoritative manuscript on Witchcraft. Within his text, Guazzo discusses witches’ pacts with the devil, detailed descriptions of witches’ powers and poisons and also prepared his classification of the demons based on a previous work by Michael Psellus.

In this work, Guazzo was greatly influenced by Duke Charles III of Lorraine’s leading lawyer and demonologist, Nicholas Remy (Remy produced one of the most important early works on demonology and witchcraft in 1595, &quot;Daemonolatreiae libri tres&quot;, and claimed to have sentenced to death over 900 people during witch trials between 1582–1592).

<text>The Prony equation (named after Gaspard de Prony) is a historically important equation in hydraulics, used to calculate the head loss due to friction within a given run of pipe. It is an empirical equation developed by Frenchman Gaspard de Prony in the 19th century:

:formula_1

where &quot;hf&quot; is the head loss due to friction, calculated from: the ratio of the length to diameter of the pipe &quot;L/D&quot;, the velocity of the flow &quot;V&quot;, and two empirical factors &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; to account for friction.

This equation has been supplanted in modern hydraulics by the Darcy–Weisbach equation, which used it as a starting point.

<text>Shedim (; singular: &quot;šēḏ&quot;) are spirits or demons in the Tanakh and Jewish mythology. Shedim do not, however, correspond exactly to the modern conception of demons as evil entities as originated in Christianity. While evil spirits were thought to cause maladies, shedim differed conceptually from evil spirits. Shedim were not considered evil demigods, but the gods of foreigners; further, they were envisaged as evil only in the sense that they were &quot;not God&quot;.

They appear only twice (and in both instances in the plural) in the Tanakh, at Psalm 106:37 and Deuteronomy 32:17. In both instances, the text deals with child sacrifice or animal sacrifice. Although the word is traditionally derived from the root ( &quot;shuḏ&quot;) that conveys the meaning of &quot;acting with violence&quot; or &quot;laying waste,&quot; it was possibly a loanword from Akkadian, in which the word &quot;shedu&quot; referred to a spirit that could be either protective or malevolent. With the translation of Hebrew texts into Greek, under the influence of Zoroastrian dualism, &quot;shedim&quot; was translated into Greek as &quot;daimonia&quot; with implicit connotations of negativity. Later, in Judeo-Islamic culture, shedim became the Hebrew word for the jinn, conveying the morally ambivalent attitude of these beings.

== Origin ==
According to one legend, the shedim are the descendants of serpents, or of demons in serpent form, in allusion to the story of the serpent in Eden, as related in Genesis. 
A second view is that they are the offspring of Lilith, from her union with Adam or other men, while a third says that God created them on the sixth day, starting to fashion their bodies but failing to complete the work because he was obliged to rest on the Sabbath. Even after the Sabbath, he left them as they were, in order to show that, when the Sabbath comes, all work still unfinished at the beginning of the Sabbath must afterward be viewed as complete. As a result, the shedim have souls like those of humans, but lack the bodies to contain them.
Yet a fourth conception was that the shedim had their origins among the builders of the Tower of Babel - these being divided by their motivations into three groups, of which the third and worst comprised those who sought actively to wage war against God and were punished for their sacrilegious hubris by transformation into the shedim.
Finally, the &quot;Zohar&quot; describes them as offspring of the demons Azazel and Naamah.

Biblical and rabbinical texts depict shedim as demonic entities, with references such as Deuteronomy 32:17 and Psalm 106:37 suggesting sacrifices to these beings, including human sacrifices like the firstborn. However, the extent and details of such practices in ancient Israel remain a subject of debate among scholars. Hurwitz&#x27;s work, citing archaeological finds and the existing rite of &#x27;pidjon ha’ben,&#x27; supports the notion of such sacrifices, especially in the archaic period.

== Traits ==
The Talmud describes the shedim as possessing some traits of angels, and some traits of humans:
According to &quot;Rashi&quot;, shedim, like &quot;lillin&quot; but unlike &quot;ruchos&quot;, have human form, although no human body. They eat and drink as humans do.

They can cause sickness and misfortune, follow the dead and fly around graves.

One is admonished not to do many thing that could invoke the shedim, such as whistling or even saying the word &quot;shedim&quot;. The 12th century mystic Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg wrote in his will and testament that one should not seal up windows completely because it traps shedim in the house.

The shedim are not always seen as malicious creatures; they can be helpful. Some are said to be even able to live according to the Torah, like Asmodeus.

Conjuring shedim is not necessarily forbidden, depending on whether the theologian discussing the topic views such summoning to constitute sorcery. Even if summoning shedim is an act of sorcery and thus forbidden, consulting shedim conjured by a non-Jew would be permissible.

== Appearance ==
In early midrashim, shedim are corporeal beings. they take the form of men, but have no shadow (Yeb. 122a; Giṭ. 66a; Yoma 75a). Sometimes they are black goat-like beings (Kiddushin 29a); other times, seven-headed dragons (Kiddushin 29a). They are occasionally called &quot;malʾake ḥabbala&quot; (angels of destruction) (Ber. 51a; Ket. 104a; Sanh. 106b). if a man could see them, he would lack the strength to face them, although he can see them by throwing the ashes of the fetus of a black cat around his eyes, or by scattering ashes around his bed he can trace their footprints similar to those of roosters in the morning ( Ber.6a). To see if the shedim were present, ashes were thrown to the ground or floor, which rendered their footsteps visible. In later Judaism, these entities developed into more abstract beings.

Shedim can shapeshift, sometimes assuming a human form, the Talmud telling how Asmodeus assumed King Solomon&#x27;s form and ruled in his place for a time, although he had to take care never to be seen barefoot because he could not disguise his clawed feet.

<doc id="270045" wikidata="Q124883245" url="?curid=270045" title="Empirical relationship">
<text>In science, an empirical relationship or phenomenological relationship is a relationship or correlation that is supported by experiment or observation but not necessarily supported by theory.

==Analytical solutions without a theory==
An empirical relationship is supported by confirmatory data irrespective of theoretical basis such as first principles. Sometimes theoretical explanations for what were initially empirical relationships are found, in which case the relationships are no longer considered empirical. An example was the Rydberg formula to predict the wavelengths of hydrogen spectral lines. Proposed in 1876, it perfectly predicted the wavelengths of the Lyman series, but lacked a theoretical basis until Niels Bohr produced his Bohr model of the atom in 1925.

On occasion, what was thought to be an empirical factor is later deemed to be a fundamental physical constant.

==Approximations==
Some empirical relationships are merely approximations, often equivalent to the first few terms of the Taylor series of an analytical solution describing a phenomenon. Other relationships only hold under certain specific conditions, reducing them to special cases of more general relationship. Some approximations, in particular phenomenological models, may even contradict theory; they are employed because they are more mathematically tractable than some theories, and are able to yield results.

<text>Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy (28 January 1793 in Plancy-l&#x27;Abbaye – 1881 in Paris) was a French occultist, demonologist and writer. He published several works on occultism and demonology.

==Biography==
He was born Jacques Albin Simon Collin on 28 (in some sources 30) January 1793 in Plancy (presently Plancy-l&#x27;Abbaye), the son of Edme-Aubin Collin and Marie-Anne Danton, the sister of Georges-Jacques Danton who was executed the year after Jacques was born. He later added the aristocratic &quot;de Plancy&quot; himself – an addition which later caused accusations against his son in his career as a diplomat. He was a free-thinker influenced by Voltaire. He worked as a printer and publisher in Plancy-l&#x27;Abbaye and Paris. Between 1830 and 1837, he resided in Brussels, and then in the Netherlands, before he returned to France after having converted to the Catholic religion.

Collin de Plancy followed the tradition of many previous demonologists of cataloguing demons by name and title of nobility, as it happened with grimoires like &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; and &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;. In 1818, his best known work, &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;, was published. In 1863, some images were added that made it famous: imaginative drawings concerning the appearance of certain demons. In 1822, it was advertised as:

:&quot;Anecdotes of the nineteenth new century or historiettes, recent anecdotes, features and words little known, singular adventures, various quotations, bringings together and curious parts, to be used for the history of customs and the spirit of the century when we live compared with the last centuries.&quot;

It is considered a major work documenting beings, characters, books, deeds and causes which pertain to the manifestations and magic of trafficking with Hell; divinations, occult sciences, grimoires, marvels, errors, prejudices, traditions, folktales, the various superstitions, and generally all manner of marvellous, surprising, mysterious, and supernatural beliefs.

By the end of 1830, he ostensibly became an enthusiastic Catholic, much to the confusion of his former admirers and detractors. In 1846, he published a two-volume work entitled &quot;Dictionnaire Sciences Occultes et des Idées superstitieuses&quot;, another listing of demons. The set cost 16 francs.

Jacques Collin de Plancy was the father of Victor Collin de Plancy (1853–1924), who, for nearly a decade, starting in 1884, was French Minister to Korea and whose collected art works and books became part of the core of the Korean collections of the French Bibliothèque Nationale and the Musée Guimet in Paris.

<doc id="270052" wikidata="Q545888" url="?curid=270052" title="Allan Cunningham (botanist)">
<text>Allan Cunningham (13 July 1791 – 27 June 1839) was an English botanist and explorer, primarily known for his expeditions into uncolonised areas of eastern Australia to collect plants and report on the suitability of the land for grazing purposes.

== Early life ==
Cunningham was born in Wimbledon, London, England, the son of Allan Cunningham (head gardener at Wimbledon Park House), who came from Renfrewshire, Scotland, and his English wife Sarah (née Juson/Jewson née Dicken). Allan Cunningham was educated at a Putney private school, Reverend John Adams Academy and then went into a solicitor&#x27;s office (a Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Conveyancer). He afterwards obtained a position with William Townsend Aiton superintendent of Kew Gardens, and this brought him in touch with Robert Brown and Joseph Banks.

== Brazil ==
On Banks&#x27; recommendation, Cunningham went to Brazil with James Bowie between 1814 and 1816 collecting specimens for Kew Gardens. Banks later wrote the Cunningham&#x27;s collections of orchids and bulbs from this part of South America contributed much honour to the Royal Gardens.

== New South Wales ==
He was soon ordered to the colony of New South Wales and on 28 September 1816 he sailed for Sydney where he arrived on 20 December 1816. He established himself at Parramatta.

=== Botanist on Oxley&#x27;s 1817 expedition ===
Cunningham joined John Oxley&#x27;s 1817 expedition beyond the Blue Mountains to the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers and shared in the privations of the 1,200 miles (1,930 km) journey. He collected specimens of about 450 species and gained valuable experience as an explorer. Cunningham named the species &quot;Acacia pendula&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus dumosa&quot; during this expedition.

=== Botanist on P.P. King&#x27;s 1817-1822 circumnavigation voyages ===
Cunningham traveled as the ship&#x27;s botanist aboard HMS &quot;Mermaid&quot; under Phillip Parker King from 1817 to 1820. The &quot;Mermaid&quot; was of only 85 tons, but sailing on 22 December 1817 they reached King George Sound on 21 January 1818. Though their stay was short many specimens were found but the islands on the west coast were comparatively barren. Towards the end of March the Goulburn Islands on the north coast were reached and many new plants were discovered. They reached Timor on 4 June 1818 and, turning for home, arrived at Port Jackson on 29 July 1818. Cunningham&#x27;s collections during this voyage included about 300 species.

Shortly after his return, Cunningham made an excursion south from Sydney, ascending the prominent peak of Mount Keira overlooking the Illawarra region and present day Wollongong. Towards the end of the year he made a voyage to Tasmania arriving at Hobart on 2 January 1819. He next visited Launceston and though often finding the botany interesting, he found little that was absolutely new, as Brown had preceded him. In May he went with King in the &quot;Mermaid&quot; on a second voyage to the north and north-west coasts. On this occasion they started up the east coast and Cunningham found many opportunities for adding to his collections. One of these was after the ship reached the mouth of the Endeavour River (the site of modern Cooktown) on 28 June 1819.

The circumnavigation of Australia was completed on 27 August when they reached Vernon Island in Clarence Strait. They again visited Timor and arrived back in Sydney on 12 January 1820. The third voyage to the north coast with King began on 15 June, but meeting bad weather the bowsprit was lost and a return was made for repairs. Sailing again on 13 July 1820 the northerly course was followed and eventually the continent was circumnavigated. Though they found the little vessel was in a bad state when they were on the north-west coast, and though serious danger was escaped until they were close to home, they were nearly wrecked off Botany Bay. The &quot;Mermaid&quot; was then condemned and the next voyage was on the &quot;Bathurst&quot; which was twice the size of the &quot;Mermaid&quot;. They left on 26 May 1821, the northern route was chosen, and when they were on the west coast of Australia it was found necessary to go to Mauritius to refit, where they arrived on 27 September 1821. They left after a stay of seven weeks and reached King George Sound on 24 December 1821. A sufficiently long stay was made for Cunningham to make an excellent collection of plants, and then turning on their tracks the &quot;Bathurst&quot; sailed up the west coast and round the north of Australia. Sydney was reached again on 25 April 1822. Cunningham provided a chapter on botany to King&#x27;s &quot;Narrative of a Survey&quot;.

=== 1823 exploration for a pass over the Liverpool Range ===

In September 1822 Cunningham went on an expedition over the Blue Mountains and arrived at Bathurst on 14 October 1822 and returned to Parramatta in January 1823. His account of about 100 plants met with will be found in &quot;Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales&quot;, edited by Barron Field, 1825, under the title &quot;A Specimen of the Indigenous Botany ... between Port Jackson and Bathurst&quot;.

Cunningham soon became more interested in expeditions of discovery than botany and in 1823 he set out from Bathurst to explore inside the Great Dividing Range. With five men and five horses, he journeyed north from Bathurst, along the Cudgegong River, passing through what is now Rylstone and Coolah and then eastwards looking for a pass through the Liverpool Range. Unable to find one, he returned west through what is now Merriwa and then north to the base of the ranges there. On 7 June, after some difficult climbing, he came across a gap in the mountains which he named Pandora&#x27;s Pass, which he thought would allow for a practicable road to the Liverpool Plains. This pass was soon superseded however by more accessible passes found to the east. He returned to Bathurst through an undeveloped Mudgee on 27 June 1823. 

Cunningham also undertook an expedition to what is now Canberra in 1824. He travelled with three convicts, three horses and a cart and he travelled via Lake Bathurst, Captains Flat and the valley in which flows the Queanbeyan River. Poor weather prevented him from continuing his journey south.

=== Voyage to Moreton Bay in 1824 ===
In September 1824 Cunningham accompanied John Oxley on his second expedition to Moreton Bay and explored up the Brisbane River.

=== Voyage to New Zealand in 1826 ===
Cunningham had long wished to visit New Zealand and on 28 August 1826 he was able to sail on a whaler. He was hospitably received by the missionaries in the Bay of Islands, was able to do much botanical work, and returned to Sydney on 20 January 1827. Accounts of his work in New Zealand will be found in Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Companion to the Botanical Magazine&quot;, 1836, and &quot;Annals of Natural History&quot;, 1838 and 1839.

=== 1827 exploration of discovery to the Darling Downs ===
In probably his most famous expedition, Cunningham set out to explore the area to the west of Moreton Bay in 1827, crossing to the west of the Great Dividing Range from the Hunter Valley and travelling north. On this journey, Cunningham named many geographical landmarks including the Dumaresq River, Macintyre River, Condamine River, the Darling Downs, Mount Dumaresq and the Burrell or Gwydir River. He wrote in his diary that the lush grassland plains on the Darling Downs were ideal for livestock grazing. Exploring around Mount Dumaresq, Cunningham found a pass, now known as Cunninghams Gap.

=== Further exploration of the Moreton Bay region ===
Cunningham returned to the Moreton Bay penal colony in 1828, setting off from Brisbane with Patrick Logan, Charles Fraser and five men to find Mount Warning and to establish the route to Cunningham&#x27;s Gap which he did, on 24 July. The peaks on either side of the gap were also named, Mount Cordeaux and Mount Mitchell. After exploring the McPherson Range area, Cunningham travelled on the south side of the Gap whereas the highway today runs further north, through the gap, from the small township of Aratula. Spicer&#x27;s Gap which runs parallel to Cunningham&#x27;s Gap was actually the pass first identified by Cunningham in 1827. After its rediscovery in 1847, Spicer&#x27;s Gap was used as a stagecoach route. In 1829, Cunningham explored the Brisbane River.

== Contributions to botany ==

Australia&#x27;s most prolific plant collector of the early nineteenth century, Cunningham had been sent to Australia to expand the collection at the King&#x27; Garden at Kew and he was given the title of &quot;King&#x27;s Collector for the Royal Garden at Kew&quot;. He was so successful that a hothouse originally built for specimens from Africa was renamed &quot;Botany Bay House&quot; because it became filled with Cunningham&#x27;s specimens. Although his main role was to collect propagation material, his lasting legacy are his herbarium sheets which are thought by his biographer, Anthony Orchard, to exceed 20,000.

It is often thought that Cunningham published few papers on botany and in his obituary, John Lindley wrote, &quot;How little he regarded posthumous fame is seen by the fewness of his published works, a brief sketch of the Flora of New Zealand being the only systematic account of his Botanical discoveries...&quot;. In fact, although he was effectively barred from publishing on botany whilst employed as &quot;King&#x27;s Collector&quot;, he nevertheless later published seven major papers, and 57 shorter papers on subjects including taxonomy, geology, physical geography and zoology. He was one of the first scientists to publish papers on botanical geography.

Cunningham was concerned that many of his discoveries sent to Kew were not published, allowing others, including William Baxter to be credited with their discovery. (Baxter had risked arrest and a possible flogging for undermining Cunningham&#x27;s work by sending specimens to commercial interests.) When Cunningham returned to London,
he sent duplicates of his herbarium specimens to other botanists, including de Candolle, Schauer, William Jackson Hooker, Bentham, Lindley and others, who published his descriptions with acknowledgement to &quot;A.Cunn.&quot;.

== Later life ==
In 1831, Cunningham returned to England, but went back to Australia in 1837 on board as government botanist, resigning the following year on finding that he was required to grow vegetables for government officials. On 27 June 1839, he died of consumption in Sydney, and was buried in the Devonshire Street Cemetery. In 1901, his remains were &quot;reverently removed&quot; and re-interred in an obelisk within the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney.

== Legacy ==

Some of Australia&#x27;s plants: &quot;Araucaria cunninghamii&quot; (hoop pine), &quot;Archontophoenix cunninghamiana&quot; (Bangalow palm), &quot;Banksia cunninghamii&quot;, &quot;Lysiphyllum cunninghamii&quot; (jigal), &quot;Casuarina cunninghamiana&quot; (river sheoak), &quot;Centipeda cunninghamii&quot; (old man weed), &quot;Ficus cunninghamii&quot;, &quot;Medicosma cunninghamii&quot; (bone wood), &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot; (myrtle tree, Tasmania), &quot;Pennantia cunninghamii&quot; (brown beech), and &quot;Polyosma cunninghamii&quot; (rainforest featherwood) commemorate Allan and his brother Richard, a botanist. The Cunningham Highway is named in honour of Allan. The genus &quot;Alania&quot; was created by Endlicher in Cunningham&#x27;s honour. Robert Brown named the conifer genus &quot;Cunninghamia&quot; after both Allan Cunningham and Dr. James Cunningham, a British doctor who introduced the trees into cultivation in 1702.

A species of Australian lizard, &quot;Egernia cunninghami&quot;, is named in honour of Allan Cunningham.

The Australian federal seat of Cunningham, which stretches from Port Kembla in the south of Wollongong to Heathcote in southern Sydney, was named after him in honour of his being the first European explorer to visit the Illawarra region.

The locality of Allan, Queensland was named after him.

<text>In the context of hardware and software systems, formal verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property, using formal methods of mathematics. 
Formal verification is a key incentive for formal specification of systems, and is at the core of formal methods.
It represents an important dimension of analysis and verification in electronic design automation and is one approach to software verification. The use of formal verification enables the highest Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL7) in the framework of common criteria for computer security certification.

Formal verification can be helpful in proving the correctness of systems such as: cryptographic protocols, combinational circuits, digital circuits with internal memory, and software expressed as source code in a programming language. Prominent examples of verified software systems include the CompCert verified C compiler and the seL4 high-assurance operating system kernel.

The verification of these systems is done by ensuring the existence of a formal proof of a mathematical model of the system. Examples of mathematical objects used to model systems are: finite-state machines, labelled transition systems, Horn clauses, Petri nets, vector addition systems, timed automata, hybrid automata, process algebra, formal semantics of programming languages such as operational semantics, denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics and Hoare logic.

== Approaches ==

=== Model Checking ===

Model checking involves a systematic and exhaustive exploration of the mathematical model. Such exploration is possible for finite models, but also for some infinite models, where infinite sets of states can be effectively represented finitely by using abstraction or taking advantage of symmetry. Usually, this consists of exploring all states and transitions in the model, by using smart and domain-specific abstraction techniques to consider whole groups of states in a single operation and reduce computing time. Implementation techniques include state space enumeration, symbolic state space enumeration, abstract interpretation, symbolic simulation, abstraction refinement. The properties to be verified are often described in temporal logics, such as linear temporal logic (LTL), Property Specification Language (PSL), SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA), or computational tree logic (CTL). The great advantage of model checking is that it is often fully automatic; its primary disadvantage is that it does not in general scale to large systems; symbolic models are typically limited to a few hundred bits of state, while explicit state enumeration requires the state space being explored to be relatively small.

=== Deductive Verification ===

Another approach is deductive verification. It consists of generating from the system and its specifications (and possibly other annotations) a collection of mathematical &quot;proof obligations&quot;, the truth of which imply conformance of the system to its specification, and discharging these obligations using either proof assistants (interactive theorem provers) (such as HOL, ACL2, Isabelle, Coq or PVS), or automatic theorem provers, including in particular satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. This approach has the disadvantage that it may require the user to understand in detail why the system works correctly, and to convey this information to the verification system, either in the form of a sequence of theorems to be proved or in the form of specifications (invariants, preconditions, postconditions) of system components (e.g. functions or procedures) and perhaps subcomponents (such as loops or data structures).

=== Application to Software ===

Formal verification of software programs involves proving that a program satisfies a formal specification of its behavior. Subareas of formal verification include deductive verification (see above), abstract interpretation, automated theorem proving, type systems, and lightweight formal methods. A promising type-based verification approach is dependently typed programming, in which the types of functions include (at least part of) those functions&#x27; specifications, and type-checking the code establishes its correctness against those specifications. Fully featured dependently typed languages support deductive verification as a special case.

Another complementary approach is program derivation, in which efficient code is produced from functional specifications by a series of correctness-preserving steps. An example of this approach is the Bird–Meertens formalism, and this approach can be seen as another form of program synthesis.

These techniques can be &quot;sound&quot;, meaning that the verified properties can be logically deduced from the semantics, or &quot;unsound&quot;, meaning that there is no such guarantee. A sound technique yields a result only once it has covered the entire space of possibilities. An example of an unsound technique is one that covers only a subset of the possibilities, for instance only integers up to a certain number, and give a &quot;good-enough&quot; result. Techniques can also be &quot;decidable&quot;, meaning that their algorithmic implementations are guaranteed to terminate with an answer, or undecidable, meaning that they may never terminate. By bounding the scope of possibilities, unsound techniques that are decidable might be able to be constructed when no decidable sound techniques are available.

== Verification and validation ==
Verification is one aspect of testing a product&#x27;s fitness for purpose. Validation is the complementary aspect. Often one refers to the overall checking process as V &amp; V.

* Validation: &quot;Are we trying to make the right thing?&quot;, i.e., is the product specified to the user&#x27;s actual needs?
* Verification: &quot;Have we made what we were trying to make?&quot;, i.e., does the product conform to the specifications?

The verification process consists of static/structural and dynamic/behavioral aspects. E.g., for a software product one can inspect the source code (static) and run against specific test cases (dynamic). Validation usually can be done only dynamically, i.e., the product is tested by putting it through typical and atypical usages (&quot;Does it satisfactorily meet all use cases?&quot;).

== Automated program repair ==
Program repair is performed with respect to an oracle, encompassing the desired functionality of the program which is used for validation of the generated fix. A simple example is a test-suite—the input/output pairs specify the functionality of the program. A variety of techniques are employed, most notably using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, and genetic programming, using evolutionary computing to generate and evaluate possible candidates for fixes. The former method is deterministic, while the latter is randomized.

Program repair combines techniques from formal verification and program synthesis. Fault-localization techniques in formal verification are used to compute program points which might be possible bug-locations, which can be targeted by the synthesis modules. Repair systems often focus on a small pre-defined class of bugs in order to reduce the search space. Industrial use is limited owing to the computational cost of existing techniques.

== Industry use ==

The growth in complexity of designs increases the importance of formal verification techniques in the hardware industry. At present, formal verification is used by most or all leading hardware companies, but its use in the software industry is still languishing. This could be attributed to the greater need in the hardware industry, where errors have greater commercial significance. Because of the potential subtle interactions between components, it is increasingly difficult to exercise a realistic set of possibilities by simulation. Important aspects of hardware design are amenable to automated proof methods, making formal verification easier to introduce and more productive.

, several operating systems have been formally verified:
NICTA&#x27;s Secure Embedded L4 microkernel, sold commercially as seL4 by OK Labs; OSEK/VDX based real-time operating system ORIENTAIS by East China Normal University; Green Hills Software&#x27;s Integrity operating system; and SYSGO&#x27;s PikeOS.
In 2016, a team led by Zhong Shao at Yale developed a formally verified operating system kernel called CertiKOS.

As of 2017, formal verification has been applied to the design of large computer networks through a mathematical model of the network, and as part of a new network technology category, intent-based networking. Network software vendors that offer formal verification solutions include Cisco Forward Networks and Veriflow Systems.

The SPARK programming language provides a toolset which enables software development with formal verification and is used in several high-integrity systems.

The CompCert C compiler is a formally verified C compiler implementing the majority of ISO C.

<doc id="270058" wikidata="Q438507" url="?curid=270058" title="Henry Darcy">
<text>Henry Philibert Gaspard Darcy (; 10 June 1803 – 3 January 1858) was a French engineer who made several important contributions to hydraulics, including Darcy’s law for flow in porous media.

==Early life==
Darcy was born in Dijon, France, on June 10, 1803. His first given name is &quot;Henry&quot;; although the French spelling &quot;Henri&quot; appears in multiple sources such as necrological notices, Darcy used the Anglicized spelling.

Despite his father&#x27;s death in 1817 when he was 14, his mother was able to borrow money to pay for his tutors. In 1821 he enrolled at the &quot;École Polytechnique&quot; (Polytechnic School) in Paris, and transferred two years later to the School of Bridges and Roads, which led to employment in the Corps of Bridges and Roads.

Darcy met an English woman, Henriette Carey, whose family had been living in Dijon, and married her in 1828.

==Engineering career==

As a member of the Corps, he built an adequate pressurized water distribution system in Dijon following the failure of attempts to supply adequate fresh water by drilling wells. The system carried water from Rosoir Spring away through a covered aqueduct (watercourse) to reservoirs near the city, which then fed into a network of 28,000 meters of pressurized pipes delivering water to much of the city. The system was fully closed and driven by gravity, and thus required no pumps with just sand acting as a filter. He was also involved in many other public works in and around Dijon, as well as in the politics of the Dijon city government.

During this period he modified the Prony equation for calculating head loss due to friction, which after further modification by Julius Weisbach would become the well-known Darcy–Weisbach equation still in use today.

In 1848 he became Chief Engineer for the &quot;département&quot; of which Dijon is the capital. Soon thereafter he left Dijon due to political pressure, but was promoted to Chief Director for Water and Pavements and took up office in Paris. While in that position, he was able to focus more on his hydraulics research, especially on flow and friction losses in pipes. During this period he improved the design of the Pitot tube, into essentially the form used today.

He resigned from his post in 1855 due to poor health but was permitted to continue his research in Dijon. In 1855 and 1856 he conducted experiments where water flowed through a column filled with sand that established what has become known as Darcy&#x27;s law; initially developed to describe flow through sands, it has since been generalized to a variety of situations and is in widespread use today e.g. for calculating the resistance of any type of porous media flow. The unit of measure of material permeability, the darcy is named in his honour.

Darcy died of pneumonia while on a trip to Paris in 1858 and is buried in Cimetière de Dijon (formerly known as Péjoces) in Dijon.

<doc id="270059" wikidata="Q3746719" url="?curid=270059" title="Flores Historiarum">
<text>The Flores Historiarum (Flowers of History) is the name of two different (though related) Latin chronicles by medieval English historians that were created in the 13th century, associated originally with the Abbey of St Albans.

== Wendover&#x27;s &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; ==
The first &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; was created by St Albans writer, Roger of Wendover, who carried his chronology from the Creation up to 1235, the year before his death. Roger claims in his preface to have selected &quot;from the books of catholic writers worthy of credit, just as flowers of various colours are gathered from various fields.&quot; Hence he also called his work &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;. However, like most chronicles, it is now valued not so much for what was culled from previous writers, as for its full and lively narrative of contemporary events from 1215 to 1235, including the signing of Magna Carta by King John at Runnymede.

The book has survived in one thirteenth-century manuscript in the Bodleian Library (MS Douce 207), a mutilated 14th-century copy in the British Library (Cotton MS Otho B V), and in the version adapted by Matthew Paris which forms the first part of his &quot;Chronica Majora&quot; (ed. Henry Richards Luard, Rolls Series, seven volumes).

The sources brought together in the &quot;Flores&quot; include Bede, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Sigebert of Gembloux, Florence of Worcester, Simeon of Durham, William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, Robert de Monte, William of Tyre, Ralph de Diceto, Benedictus Abbas, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph of Coggeshall (to 1194). A detailed list is given by Luard, who in his running text also marks up the apparent source of each section. From 1201 and through the reign of King John it draws on a source common between it and the &quot;Annales Sancti Edmundi&quot; later also used by John de Taxster, and also some annals added to the St. Albans copy of Diceto.

The date of creation of the earliest nucleus of the compilation has been disputed. The manuscript in the Bodleian Library, written out ca. 1300, contains a marginal note against the annal for 1188 that reads &quot;up to here in Abbot John&#x27;s chronicle book&quot;. Luard took this to mean that there had existed a core of the &quot;Flores&quot; going up to 1188, the creation of which had been supervised by John of Wallingford at some point during his tenure as abbot of St Albans between 1195 and 1214. On the other hand, 1188 is also when the first manuscript of Matthew Paris&#x27;s &quot;Chronica Majora&quot; concludes, with the end of the reign of Henry II, so an alternative view is that this may have been the chronicle book referred to, which may have been in the possession of a later Abbot John at the turn of the 14th century when the manuscript was written out.

Considering the text itself, some of the earlier parts of the work draw heavily on the &quot;Historia scholastica&quot; (ca. 1173) of Petrus Comestor, a copy of which was not introduced into the monastery until John of Wallingford&#x27;s abbacy. (Though Luard elsewhere notes some differences between the treatment of Comestor and that of some other writers). The work of Diceto, which is used throughout the &quot;Flores&quot; but especially after 1066, was also not copied for the Abbey until 1204. In its final form the annal for 1179 contains a reference to the Lateran Council of 1215, and Vaughan finds that all of the extant manuscripts ultimately descend from a common ancestral exemplar that can be no earlier than 1228. However, Vaughan does not rule out the possibility that there might have been some earlier compilation used by Wendover, and finds some evidence for such a compilation, extending perhaps to 1066.

== Paris&#x27;s &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;, and its continuation ==
The second and more widely distributed &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; runs from the creation to 1326 (although some of the earlier manuscripts end at 1306). It was compiled by various persons and quickly acquired contemporary popularity, for it was continued by many hands in many manuscript traditions. Among twenty surviving manuscripts are those compiled at St Benet Holme, Norfolk, continued at Tintern Abbey (Royal Mss 14.c.6); at Norwich (Cottonian Claudius E 8); Rochester (Cottonian Nero D 2); St Paul&#x27;s, London (Lambeth Mss 1106); St Mary&#x27;s, Southwark (Bodleian Library, Rawlinson Mss B 177); and at St Augustine&#x27;s, Canterbury (Harley MS 641).

It was written originally at St Albans Abbey and later at Westminster Abbey. The earliest manuscript, the basis for all the various continuations, is conserved in Chetham&#x27;s Library, Manchester. This manuscript was carried down to 1265, with brief notes and emendations in the hand of Matthew Paris. A continuation carried the chronicle down to 1306; the continuation from 1306 to 1325/26 was compiled at Westminster by Robert of Reading (d. 1325) and another Westminster monk.

The second &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; was for many years attributed to a &quot;Matthew of Westminster,&quot; who Henry Richards Luard demonstrated was actually Matthew Paris.

The &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; is markedly opposed to Robert the Bruce. According to the chronicle, after Bruce had had himself crowned king of Scots in the spring of 1306, Lady Elisabeth Bruce tells her husband: &quot;I reckon that you are a summer king; perhaps you won&#x27;t be a winter one&quot;.

<doc id="270061" wikidata="Q19065" url="?curid=270061" title="Adrenal cortex">
<text>The adrenal cortex is the outer region and also the largest part of the adrenal gland. It is divided into three separate zones: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. Each zone is responsible for producing specific hormones. It is also a secondary site of androgen synthesis.

== Layers ==
The adrenal cortex comprises three main zones, or layers that are regulated by distinct hormones as noted below. This &quot;anatomic zonation&quot; can be appreciated at the microscopic level, where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics.

=== Zona glomerulosa ===
The outermost layer, the zona glomerulosa is the main site for the production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid. The synthesis and secretion of aldosterone are mainly regulated by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. The zona glomerulosa cells express a specific enzyme aldosterone synthase (also known as CYP11B2). Aldosterone is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure. Aldosterone&#x27;s effects are on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct). Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon, and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry.

The secretion of aldosterone is also stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

The cells of the zona glomerulosa do not express 11β-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase. This is the reason zona glomerulosa cannot synthesize cortisol, corticosterone, or sex hormones (androgens).
The expression of neuron-specific proteins in the zona glomerulosa cells of human adrenocortical tissues has been predicted and reported by several authors and it was suggested that the expression of proteins like the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the cells of the zona glomerulosa reflects the regenerative feature of these cells, which would lose NCAM immunoreactivity after moving to the zona fasciculata. However, together with other data on neuroendocrine properties of zona glomerulosa cells, NCAM expression may reflect a neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells.

=== Zona fasciculata ===
Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the cells of the zona fasciculata synthesize and secrete glucocorticoids (such as 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and cortisol), as well as small amounts of adrenal androgens and estrogens. The zona fasciculata has more 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity than the zona reticularis. Therefore, the zona fasciculata makes more 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and cortisol. The major hormone that stimulates cortisol secretion in humans is the ACTH that is released from the anterior pituitary. It has been shown that the steroidogenic capacity of the zona fasciculata increases during illness in infants.

=== Zona reticularis ===
The innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, produces adrenal androgens, as well as small amounts of estrogens and some glucocorticoids. The zona reticularis has more of the cofactors required for the 17,20-lyase activity of 17α-hydroxylase than zona fasciculata. Therefore, the zona reticularis makes more androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans. The secretion of DHEAS is also stimulated by ACTH.

== Hormone synthesis ==

The precursor of steroids synthesized in the adrenal cortex is cholesterol that is stored in vesicles. Cholesterol can be synthesized de novo in the adrenal cortex. Yet, the major source of cholesterol appears to be cholesterol that is taken up with circulating lipoproteins.
The steps up to this point occur in many steroid-producing tissues. Subsequent steps to generate aldosterone and cortisol, however, primarily occur in the adrenal cortex:
* Progesterone → (hydroxylation at C21) → 11-Deoxycorticosterone → (two further hydroxylations at C11 and C18) → Aldosterone
* Progesterone → (hydroxylation at C17) → 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone → (hydroxylation at C21) → 11-Deoxycortisol → (hydroxylation at C11) → Cortisol
== Production ==
The adrenal cortex produces a number of different corticosteroid hormones.

=== Mineralocorticoids ===

The primary mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, is produced in the adrenocortical zona glomerulosa by the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase (also known as CYP11B2). Aldosterone is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure. Aldosterone effects on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct). Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon, and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry.

=== Glucocorticoids ===

Glucocorticoids are produced mainly in the zona fasciculata.
Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that are necessary for life. They play a role in numerous physiological responses including; metabolism, immune response, mood, cognitive functions, cardiovascular function, and reproduction. Glucocorticoids are also widely prescribed as medication to treat numerous conditions such as autoimmune diseases and lymphoproliferative diseases. The main glucocorticoid in humans is cortisol. 

=== Androgens ===

They are produced mainly in the zona reticularis. The most important androgens include:
* Testosterone: a hormone with a wide variety of effects, ranging from enhancing muscle mass and stimulation of cell growth to the development of the secondary sex characteristics.
* Dihydrotestosterone (DHT): a metabolite of testosterone, and a more potent androgen than testosterone in that it binds more strongly to androgen receptors.
* Androstenedione (Andro): an androgenic steroid produced by the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenediones are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, they are also the parent structure of estrone.
* Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): It is the primary precursor of natural estrogens. DHEA is also called dehydroisoandrosterone or dehydroandrosterone. The reticularis also produces DHEA-sulfate due to the actions of a sulfotransferase, SULT2A1.

== Pathology ==

* Adrenal insufficiency (e.g. due to Addison&#x27;s disease)
* Cushing&#x27;s syndrome
* Cushing&#x27;s disease
* Conn&#x27;s syndrome
* Adrenocortical carcinoma

<doc id="270062" wikidata="Q1930895" url="?curid=270062" title="Operational semantics">
<text>Operational semantics is a category of formal programming language semantics in which certain desired properties of a program, such as correctness, safety or security, are verified by constructing proofs from logical statements about its execution and procedures, rather than by attaching mathematical meanings to its terms (denotational semantics). Operational semantics are classified in two categories: structural operational semantics (or small-step semantics) formally describe how the &quot;individual steps&quot; of a computation take place in a computer-based system; by opposition natural semantics (or big-step semantics) describe how the &quot;overall results&quot; of the executions are obtained. Other approaches to providing a formal semantics of programming languages include axiomatic semantics and denotational semantics.

The operational semantics for a programming language describes how a valid program is interpreted as sequences of computational steps. These sequences then &quot;are&quot; the meaning of the program. In the context of functional programming, the final step in a terminating sequence returns the value of the program. (In general there can be many return values for a single program, because the program could be nondeterministic, and even for a deterministic program there can be many computation sequences since the semantics may not specify exactly what sequence of operations arrives at that value.)

Perhaps the first formal incarnation of operational semantics was the use of the lambda calculus to define the semantics of Lisp. Abstract machines in the tradition of the SECD machine are also closely related.

== History ==
The concept of operational semantics was used for the first time in defining the semantics of Algol 68.
The following statement is a quote from the revised ALGOL 68 report:
The meaning of a program in the strict language is explained in terms of a hypothetical computer
which performs the set of actions that constitute the elaboration of that program. (Algol68, Section 2)
The first use of the term &quot;operational semantics&quot; in its present meaning is attributed to
Dana Scott (Plotkin04).
What follows is a quote from Scott&#x27;s seminal paper on formal semantics,
in which he mentions the &quot;operational&quot; aspects of semantics.
It is all very well to aim for a more ‘abstract’ and a ‘cleaner’ approach to
semantics, but if the plan is to be any good, the operational aspects cannot
be completely ignored. (Scott70)
== Approaches ==
Gordon Plotkin introduced the structural operational semantics, Matthias Felleisen and Robert Hieb the reduction semantics, and Gilles Kahn the natural semantics.

=== Small-step semantics ===
==== Structural operational semantics ====
Structural operational semantics (SOS, also called structured operational semantics or small-step semantics) was introduced by Gordon Plotkin in (Plotkin81) as a logical means to define operational semantics. The basic idea behind SOS is to define the behavior of a program in terms of the behavior of its parts, thus providing a structural, i.e., syntax-oriented and inductive, view on operational semantics. An SOS specification defines the behavior of a program in terms of a (set of) transition relation(s). SOS specifications take the form of a set of inference rules that define the valid transitions of a composite piece of syntax in terms of the transitions of its components.

For a simple example, we consider part of the semantics of a simple programming language; proper illustrations are given in Plotkin81 and Hennessy90, and other textbooks. Let formula_1 range over programs of the language, and let formula_2 range over states (e.g. functions from memory locations to values). If we have expressions (ranged over by formula_3), values and locations (formula_4), then a memory update command would have semantics:

formula_5
Informally, the rule says that &quot;if the expression formula_3 in state formula_2 reduces to value formula_8, then the program formula_9 will update the state formula_2 with the assignment formula_11&quot;.

The semantics of sequencing can be given by the following three rules:

formula_12

Informally, the first rule says that,
if program formula_13 in state formula_2 finishes in state formula_15, then the program formula_16 in state formula_2 will reduce to the program formula_18 in state formula_15.
(You can think of this as formalizing &quot;You can run formula_13, and then run formula_18
using the resulting memory store.)
The second rule says that
if the program formula_13 in state formula_2 can reduce to the program formula_24 with state formula_15, then the program formula_16 in state formula_2 will reduce to the program formula_28 in state formula_15.
(You can think of this as formalizing the principle for an optimizing compiler:
&quot;You are allowed to transform formula_13 as if it were stand-alone, even if it is just the
first part of a program.&quot;)
The semantics is structural, because the meaning of the sequential program formula_16, is defined by the meaning of formula_13 and the meaning of formula_18.

If we also have Boolean expressions over the state, ranged over by formula_34, then we can define the semantics of the while command:
formula_35

Such a definition allows formal analysis of the behavior of programs, permitting the study of relations between programs. Important relations include simulation preorders and bisimulation.
These are especially useful in the context of concurrency theory.

Thanks to its intuitive look and easy-to-follow structure,
SOS has gained great popularity and has become a de facto standard in defining
operational semantics. As a sign of success, the original report (so-called Aarhus
report) on SOS (Plotkin81) has attracted more than 1000 citations according to the CiteSeer ,
making it one of the most cited technical reports in Computer Science.

==== Reduction semantics ====
Reduction semantics is an alternative presentation of operational semantics. Its key ideas were first applied to purely functional call by name and call by value variants of the lambda calculus by Gordon Plotkin in 1975 and generalized to higher-order functional languages with imperative features by Matthias Felleisen in his 1987 dissertation. The method was further elaborated by Matthias Felleisen and Robert Hieb in 1992 into a fully equational theory for control and state. The phrase “reduction semantics” itself was first coined by Felleisen and Daniel P. Friedman in a PARLE 1987 paper.

Reduction semantics are given as a set of &quot;reduction rules&quot; that each specify a single potential reduction step. For example, the following reduction rule states that an assignment statement can be reduced if it sits immediately beside its variable declaration:

formula_36

To get an assignment statement into such a position it is “bubbled up” through function applications and the right-hand side of assignment statements until it reaches the proper point. Since intervening formula_37 expressions may declare distinct variables, the calculus also demands an extrusion rule for formula_37 expressions. Most published uses of reduction semantics define such “bubble rules” with the convenience of evaluation contexts. For example, the grammar of evaluation contexts in a simple call by value language can be given as

formula_39

where formula_40 denotes arbitrary expressions and formula_41 denotes fully-reduced values. Each evaluation context includes exactly one hole formula_42 into which a term is plugged in a capturing fashion. The shape of the context indicates with this hole where reduction may occur. To describe “bubbling” with the aid of evaluation contexts, a single axiom suffices:

formula_43

This single reduction rule is the lift rule from Felleisen and Hieb&#x27;s lambda calculus for assignment statements. The evaluation contexts restrict this rule to certain terms, but it is freely applicable in any term, including under lambdas.

Following Plotkin, showing the usefulness of a calculus derived from a set of reduction rules demands (1) a Church-Rosser lemma for the single-step relation, which induces an evaluation function, and (2) a Curry-Feys standardization lemma for the transitive-reflexive closure of the single-step relation, which replaces the non-deterministic search in the evaluation function with a deterministic left-most/outermost search. Felleisen showed that imperative extensions of this calculus satisfy these theorems. Consequences of these theorems are that the equational theory—the symmetric-transitive-reflexive closure—is a sound reasoning principle for these languages. However, in practice, most applications of reduction semantics dispense with the calculus and use the standard reduction only (and the evaluator that can be derived from it).

Reduction semantics are particularly useful given the ease by which evaluation contexts can model state or unusual control constructs (e.g., first-class continuations). In addition, reduction semantics have been used to model object-oriented languages, contract systems, exceptions, futures, call-by-need, and many other language features. A thorough, modern treatment of reduction semantics that discusses several such applications at length is given by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler and Matthew Flatt in &quot;Semantics Engineering with PLT Redex&quot;.

===Big-step semantics===
====Natural semantics====
Big-step structural operational semantics is also known under the names natural semantics, relational semantics and evaluation semantics. Big-step operational semantics was introduced under the name &quot;natural semantics&quot; by Gilles Kahn when presenting Mini-ML, a pure dialect of ML.

One can view big-step definitions as definitions of functions, or more generally of relations, interpreting each language construct in an appropriate domain. Its intuitiveness makes it a popular choice for semantics specification in programming languages, but it has some drawbacks that make it inconvenient or impossible to use in many situations, such as languages with control-intensive features or concurrency.

A big-step semantics describes in a divide-and-conquer manner how final evaluation results of language constructs can be obtained by combining the evaluation results of their syntactic counterparts (subexpressions, substatements, etc.).

== Comparison ==
There are a number of distinctions between small-step and big-step semantics that influence whether one or the other forms a more suitable basis for specifying the semantics of a programming language.

Big-step semantics have the advantage of often being simpler (needing fewer inference rules) and often directly correspond to an efficient implementation of an interpreter for the language (hence Kahn calling them &quot;natural&quot;.) Both can lead to simpler proofs, for example when proving the preservation of correctness under some program transformation.

The main disadvantage of big-step semantics is that non-terminating (diverging) computations do not have an inference tree, making it impossible to state and prove properties about such computations.

Small-step semantics give more control over the details and order of evaluation. In the case of instrumented operational semantics, this allows the operational semantics to track and the semanticist to state and prove more accurate theorems about the run-time behaviour of the language. These properties make small-step semantics more convenient when proving type soundness of a type system against an operational semantics.

<doc id="270063" wikidata="Q1154469" url="?curid=270063" title="Kikuko Inoue">
<text>is a Japanese voice actress, singer and narrator. She has been part of the singing groups DoCo and Goddess Family Club. She is the founder and manager of her voice-acting company, Office Anemone. Inoue tends to play the &quot;perfect girlfriend&quot; or &quot;motherly&quot; role in many series, but has also played more sultry and provocative roles.

==Biography==
Inoue&#x27;s vocal roles are usually female characters characterized as dignified, reserved, beautiful, kind, regal, mature or domestic. For example, Belldandy, a goddess who is kind, compassionate and skilled at domestic tasks. Kasumi Tendo is an older sister who has taken over domestic duties after the death of her mother, and who acts as a counterbalance to the more rambunctious members of her family. Notably, both Kasumi and Belldandy are almost parallels of each other due to their roles as domestics in a home which could explode into chaos at any moment. She also plays Rune Venus in &quot;El-Hazard&quot;, a princess and leader of her country; as well as Kazami Mizuho in &quot;Please Teacher!&quot;, a sensible, strong-hearted alien agent in charge of observing humanity that ends up falling in love with an earthling. In the video game &quot;Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony&quot;, she voices as Kirumi Tojo aka &quot;The Ultimate Maid&quot; A loyal and serious Ultimate who takes care of both chores and the students during the Killing School Semester, who goes by the saying &quot;duty before self&quot;; This role also exposes Kikuko&#x27;s love of maids. When she thinks of maid characters, she always tend to imagine them as a lighthearted one, but Kirumi is definitely the type of an amazing perfectionist whose only cred is &quot;selfless devotion.&quot; Inoue also said that she can be a little bit nervous playing as Kirumi in the official Artbook Character Profile. And on May 12, 2020, Kikuko cosplayed as Kirumi for Maid Day.

She occasionally takes on roles which are more sultry, such as Corvette in &quot;Idol Project&quot;, a curvaceous dancer who flirts quite intensely with Mimu, the young heroine. In the hentai OVA &quot;Ogenki Clinic&quot; she provides the voice of a sex-crazed nurse. Also, as Lust in &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&quot;, she was an antagonist the main characters have to contend with more than once. On very rare occasions she takes male roles, such as Tsubasa Oozora from &quot;Captain Tsubasa ROAD to 2002&quot;, as she has stated that these roles allow her to shout, which she finds &quot;liberating&quot;.

She is referred to as &quot;Onee-chan&quot; (&quot;big sister&quot; in Japanese) and stayed with the title on her official site and a few albums because of her role as Kasumi Tendo in &quot;Ranma ½&quot;; this is confirmed in her online profile. She believes that in her past life she was a fish and therefore uses fish as her trademark. She made a guest appearance at the 2007 Animazement anime convention in Durham, North Carolina for an autograph and Q&amp;A session. When asked her age, she often responds that she is only 17, which has become a running gag at events as well as anime shows. At an Otakon 2009 panel, she explained that the number 17 was an aesthetic choice. After voice acting Belldandy from the &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot; anime, subsequent chapters of the manga used Inoue&#x27;s distinctive style as the basis for Belldandy&#x27;s character.

She won Best Supporting Voice Actress in the 4th Seiyu Awards. In 2016, at the 10th Seiyu Awards, she won the Kazue Takahashi Award for &quot;the female performer who broadens the profession of voice acting in every form of media.&quot;

Inoue is married, and has a daughter named Honoka. Honoka uses Inoue as her stage &quot;family&quot; name and she is also a voice actress and singer. Inoue was good friends with fellow voice actress Atsuko Tanaka, who passed away in August 20, 2024.

<text>The Marina District Development Company, LLC was a joint venture of Boyd Gaming Corporation and MGM Resorts International that was established to develop and operate the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

==History ==
After a competitive process, MGM Mirage was selected as the lead developer of government-owned vacant property in the &quot;H-Tract&quot; area, later renamed Renaissance Pointe. MGM Mirage sought the participation of Boyd Gaming, which became the operating partner of the Borgata.

Three casino-hotels were planned for Renaissance Pointe but only the Borgata has been built.

In early 2010, following the conclusion of an investigation by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the Division of Gaming Enforcement into the company&#x27;s suitability as a casino licensee, executives at MGM announced that they would place their shares in MDDC into a special trust until they find a suitable buyer. In their investigation, the NJCCC and DGE alleged that Macau businesswoman Pansy Ho and her father Stanley have deep ties to criminal elements in Macau and mainland China, and therefore would not be suitable for licensing in New Jersey. The NJCCC gave MGM a choice of ending their relationship with Ho by selling their interest in the MGM Grand Macau, or facing revocation of their New Jersey casino license. On October 14, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission approved the $73 million sale of land underneath the Borgata to Vornado Realty Trust and Geyser Holdings as part of its exit strategy from Atlantic City. On September 10, 2014, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission approved MGM Resorts International&#x27;s licensure to resume its 50 percent ownership stake in the partnership.

On August 1, 2016, MGM Resorts International completed the purchase of Boyd Gaming&#x27;s 50 percent in Marina District Development and The Borgata for $900 million. On that day MDDC ceased to exist and a new company Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa, LLC. was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts International.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1903:

==Events==

===January–December===
*1 January – Konstantin Tsiolkovski deduces the Basic Rocket Equation in his article &quot;Explorations of outer space with the help of reaction apparatuses&quot;.
*12 February - The world″s first successful heavier-than-air aircraft engine, which will power the Wright brothers″ first airplane in December 1903, runs for the first time in Dayton, Ohio.
*16 February – Traian Vuia presents to the Académie des Sciences of Paris the possibility of flying with a heavier-than-air mechanical machine and his procedure for taking off, but is rejected for being a utopia, adding the comments: &quot;The problem of flight with a machine which weighs more than air can not be solved and it is only a dream.&quot;
*23 March – The Wright brothers file an application for a patent for an airplane based on the design of their Glider No. 3.
*31 March – Richard Pearse is reputed to have made a powered flight in a heavier-than-air craft, a monoplane of his own construction, that crash lands on a hedge. This date is computed from evidence of eyewitnesses as the flight was not well documented at the time. The flight is claimed to have been around 150 feet (45 m) on his farm at Upper Waitohi, near Timaru in south Canterbury, New Zealand.
*11 May – Richard Pearse is claimed to have made a flight of around 1,000 yards (900 m), landing in the semi-dry bed of the Ōpihi River.
* 27 June – 19-year-old American socialite Aida de Acosta becomes the first woman to fly a powered aircraft solo when she pilots Santos-Dumont&#x27;s motorized dirigible, “No. 9”, from Paris to Château de Bagatelle in France.
*18 August – Karl Jatho makes a flight with his motored aircraft in front of four people. His craft flies up to 200 feet (60 m) a few feet above the ground.
*7 October – Samuel Langley conducts the first tests of his full-sized man-carrying version of his earlier model aerodromes. The pilot, Charles Manly, nearly drowns when the machine slides off its launch apparatus atop a houseboat and falls into the Potomac River.
*12 November – The Lebaudy brothers make a controlled dirigible flight of from Moisson to Paris, France.
*19 November – Léon Y. K. Levavasseur demonstrates his Antoinette engine, designed as a lightweight powerplant specifically for aircraft.
*8 December – Second attempt by Charles Manly to fly Langley&#x27;s repaired full-sized aerodrome. As with the October 7 attempt the machine fails to fly, tripping on its launch gear and somersaulting into the Potomac River, nearly killing Manly. A surviving photograph captures the machine upended on its side as it falls off the houseboat. Langley himself was absent at this attempt but the machine&#x27;s failure to fly ended his government (i.e. U.S. Army) funded attempts at building a successful full sized man-carrying flying machine.
*17 December – The Wright Brothers make four flights in their &quot;Flyer&quot; at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina following years of research and development. Orville Wright takes off first and flies 120 ft (37 m) in 12 seconds. This is frequently considered the first controlled, powered heavier-than-air flight and is the first such flight photographed. On the fourth effort, Wilbur flies 852 ft (260 m) in 59 seconds.

==Births==
*9 January – Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, German test pilot (shot down 1945)

<doc id="270072" wikidata="Q2091969" url="?curid=270072" title="Proximity card">
<text>A proximity card or prox card also known as a key card or keycard is a contactless smart card which can be read without inserting it into a reader device, as required by earlier magnetic stripe cards such as credit cards and contact type smart cards. The proximity cards are part of the contactless card technologies. Held near an electronic reader for a moment they enable the identification of an encoded number. The reader usually produces a beep or other sound to indicate the card has been read.

The term &quot;proximity card&quot; refers to the older 125 kHz devices as distinct from the newer 13.56 MHz contactless smartcards. Second generation prox cards are used for mass and distance reading applications. Proximity cards typically have a read range of up to which is the main difference from the contactless smartcard with a range of . The card can often be left in a wallet or purse, and read by simply holding the wallet or purse near the reader. These early proximity cards can&#x27;t hold more data than a magnetic stripe card, and only cards with smart chips (ie, contactless smartcards) can hold other types of data like electronic funds balance for contactless payment systems, history data for time and attendance or biometric templates. When used without encoding data, only with the card serial number, contactless smartcards have similar functionalities to proximity cards.

== Types ==

=== Passive cards ===
Passive 125 kHz cards, the more widely used type which were described above, are powered by radio frequency signals from the reader device and so have a limited range and must be held close to the reader unit. They are used as keycards for access control doors in office buildings. A version with more memory, contactless smartcards, are used for other applications: library cards, contactless payment systems, and public transit fare cards.

=== Active cards ===
Active 125 kHz prox cards, sometimes called vicinity cards, are powered by an internal lithium battery. They can have a greater range, up to 2 meters (6 ft). Other contactless technologies like UHF (Ultra High Frequency) smart cards can reach up to 150 meters (500 ft) and are often used for applications where the card is read inside a vehicle, such as security gates which open when a vehicle with the access card inside approaches, or automated toll collection. The battery eventually runs down, however, and the card must be replaced after 2 to 7 years.

== Method of operation ==
The card and the reader unit communicate with each other through 125 kHz radio frequency fields (13.56 MHz for the contactless smartcard cards) by a process called resonant energy transfer. Passive cards have three components which are sealed inside the plastic: an antenna consisting of a coil of wire, a capacitor, and an integrated circuit (IC) which contains the user&#x27;s ID number in specific formats and no other data. The reader has its own antenna, which continuously transmits a short range radio frequency field.

When the card is placed within range of the reader, the antenna coil and capacitor, which form a tuned circuit, absorb and store energy from the field, resonating at the frequency emitted by the reader. This energy is rectified to direct current which powers the integrated circuit. The chip sends its ID number or other data to the antenna coil, which transmits it by radio frequency signals back to the reader unit. The reader checks whether the ID number from the card is correct, and then performs whatever function it has been programmed to do for that ID number. All the energy to power the card comes from the reader unit, so passive cards must be close to a reader to transmit their data.

An active card contains a flat lithium cell in addition to the above components to power it. The integrated circuit contains a receiver which uses the battery&#x27;s power to amplify the signal from the reader unit so it is stronger, allowing the card to detect the reader at a greater distance. The battery also powers a transmitter circuit in the chip which transmits a stronger return signal to cover the greater distance.

== Standards for proximity cards ==
Proximity cards are all proprietary. This is also the case of the memory-based first generation of contactless smartcards. This means that there is no compatibility between the readers of a specific brand and the cards of another brand.

Contactless smartcards are covered by the ISO/IEC 14443 and/or the ISO/IEC 15693 OR ISO/IEC 18000 standards. These standards define two types of card (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, each with different communications protocols) which typically have a range up to . The related ISO/IEC 15693 (vicinity card) standard typically works up to a longer range of .
The reality is that ISO/IEC 14443 as well as ISO/IEC 15693 can only be fully implemented on microprocessor-based cards. The best way to check if a technology meets ISO standard is to ask the manufacturer if it can be emulated on other devices without any proprietary hardware.

== 125 kHz readers and formats ==
The card readers communicate in various protocols, for example the Wiegand protocol that consists of a data 0 and a data 1 circuit (or binary or simple on/off (digital) type circuit). Other known protocols are mono directional Clock and Data or bidirectional OSDP (RS 485), RS 232 or UART. The earliest card formats were up to 64 bits long. As demand has increased, bit size has increased to continue to provide unique numbers. Often, the first several bits can be made identical; these are called facility or site codes. The idea is that company A has a facility code of &quot;xn&quot; and a card set of 0001 through 1000 and company B has a facility code of &quot;yn&quot; and a card set also of 0001 through 1000. For smartcards, a numbering system is internationally harmonized and allocated by Netherlands-based NEN (registration authority) according to ISO/IEC 6523 and ISO/IEC 15459 standards.

<text>Synthetic fibers or synthetic fibres (in British English; see spelling differences) are fibers made by humans through chemical synthesis, as opposed to natural fibers that are directly derived from living organisms, such as plants like cotton or fur from animals. They are the result of extensive research by scientists to replicate naturally occurring animal and plant fibers. In general, synthetic fibers are created by extruding fiber-forming materials through spinnerets, forming a fiber. These are called synthetic or artificial fibers. The word polymer comes from a Greek prefix &quot;poly&quot; which means &quot;many&quot; and suffix &quot;mer&quot; which means &quot;single units&quot;. (Note: each single unit of a polymer is called a monomer).

== The first synthetic fibres ==

Nylon was the first commercially successful synthetic thermoplastic polymer. DuPont began its research project in 1927. The first nylon, nylon 66, was synthesized on February 28, 1935, by Wallace Hume Carothers at DuPont&#x27;s research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station.

The next step was taken by Hilaire de Chardonnet, a French engineer and industrialist, who invented the first artificial silk, which he called &quot;Chardonnet silk&quot;. In the late 1870s, Chardonnet was working with Louis Pasteur on a remedy to the epidemic that was destroying French silkworms. Failure to clean up a spill in the darkroom resulted in Chardonnet&#x27;s discovery of nitrocellulose as a potential replacement for real silk. Realizing the value of such a discovery, Chardonnet began to develop his new product, which he displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. Chardonnet&#x27;s material was extremely flammable, and subsequently replaced with other, more stable materials.

==Commercial products==

The first successful process was developed in 1894 by English chemist Charles Frederick Cross, and his collaborators Edward John Bevan and Clayton Beadle. They named the fiber &quot;viscose&quot;, because the reaction product of carbon disulfide and cellulose in basic conditions gave a highly viscous solution of xanthate. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company Courtaulds in 1905. The name &quot;rayon&quot; was adopted in 1924, with &quot;viscose&quot; being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane. A similar product known as cellulose acetate was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood.

Nylon, the first synthetic fiber in the &quot;fully synthetic&quot; sense of that term, was developed by Wallace Carothers, an American researcher at the chemical firm DuPont in the 1930s. It soon made its debut in the United States as a replacement for silk, just in time for the introduction of rationing during World War II. Its novel use as a material for women&#x27;s stockings overshadowed more practical uses, such as a replacement for the silk in parachutes and other military uses like ropes.

The first polyester fiber was patented in Britain in 1928 by the International General Electric company. It was also produced by British chemists working at the Calico Printers&#x27; Association, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson, in 1941. They produced and patented one of the first polyester fibers which they named Terylene, also known as Dacron, equal to or surpassing nylon in toughness and resilience. ICI and DuPont went on to produce their own versions of the fiber.

The world production of synthetic fibers was 55.2 million tonnes in 2014.

==Descriptions==
About half of all fibres are synthetic, with applications in every field of fiber and textile technology. Although many classes of fibers based on synthetic polymers have been evaluated as potentially valuable commercial products, four of them - nylon, polyester, acrylic and polyolefin - dominate the market. These four account for approximately 98 percent by volume of synthetic fiber production, with polyester alone accounting for around 60 percent.

Synthetic fibers are a source of microplastic pollution from laundry machines.
==Common synthetic fibers==
Common synthetic fibers include:
* Nylon (1931)

Modern fibers that are made from older artificial materials include:
* Glass fiber (1938) is used for:
** industrial, automotive, and home insulation (glass wool)
** reinforcement of composite materials (glass-reinforced plastic, glass fiber reinforced concrete)
** specialty papers in battery separators and filtration
* Metallic fiber (1946) is used for:
** adding metallic properties to clothing for the purpose of fashion (usually made with composite plastic and metal foils)
** elimination and prevention of static charge build-up
** conducting electricity to transmit information
** conduction of heat

<text>Bonyads ( &quot;Foundation&quot;) are charitable trusts in Iran that play a major role in Iran&#x27;s economy. They control an estimated 20% of Iran&#x27;s GDP, and are second only to the oil industry in manufacturing, trading, and real estate development in Iran. As of 2010, the largest bonyad is the Mostazafan Foundation, worth approximately $10 billion. In addition to large national bonyads like the Mostazafan Foundation, there are numerous bonyads affiliated with local clerics in &quot;almost every&quot; Iranian town. All are answerable only to the Supreme Leader of Iran. As of 2008, bonyads employ somewhere between 400,000 and 5 million Iranians.

Technically religious charitable organizations, they have evolved into &quot;giant private monopolies with no governmental oversight&quot;, and are now described as channeling revenues to groups supporting the Islamic Republic, while providing limited and inadequate charity to the poor. Exempt from taxes and benefiting from &quot;huge subsidies from government,&quot; they have been called &quot;bloated,&quot; and &quot;a major weakness of Iran&#x27;s economy,&quot; that siphons off production to the lucrative black market.

==Background==

===Monarchy===

Founded as royal foundations by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the original bonyads were criticized for providing a &quot;smokescreen of charity&quot; to patronage, economic control, for-profit wheeling and dealing done with the goal of &quot;keep[ing] the Shah in Power.&quot; Resembling more a secretive conglomerate than a charitable trust, these bonyads invested heavily in property development, such as the Kish Island resort; but the developments&#x27; housing and retail was oriented to the middle and upper classes, rather than the poor and needy.

===Islamic Republic===

After the 1979 Iranian revolution, the bonyads were nationalized and renamed with the declared intention of redistributing income to the poor and families of martyrs, i.e. those killed in the service of the country. The assets of many Iranians whose ideas or social positions ran contrary to the new Islamic government were also confiscated and given to the bonyads without any compensation.

Today, over 100 bonyads exist, and they are criticized for many of the same reasons as their predecessors. They form tax-exempt, government subsidized, consortiums receiving religious donations and answerable directly (and only) to the Supreme Leader of Iran. The bonyads are involved in everything from vast soybean and cotton fields to hotels to soft drinks to auto-manufacturing to shipping lines. The most prominent, the &quot;Bonyad-e Mostazafen va Janbazan&quot;, (Foundation for the Oppressed and Disabled), for example, &quot;controls 20% of the country&#x27;s production of textiles, 40% of soft drinks, two-thirds of all glass products and a dominant share also in tiles, chemicals, tires, foodstuffs.&quot; 

Some economists argue that its chair, and not the Minister of Finance or president of the Central bank, is considered the most powerful economic post in Iran. In addition to the very large national bonyads, &quot;almost every Iranian town has its own bonyad,&quot; affiliated with local clerics.

Estimates of how many people the bonyads employ ranges from in excess of 400,000 to &quot;as many as 5 million.&quot;

Bonyads also play a crucial role in the spread of Iranian influence through extensive transnational and international activities, including philanthropy and commerce as soft power as well as providing hard power support.

==Criticism==

Bonyads are criticized as an enormously wasteful use of Iran&#x27;s resources: overstaffed, corrupt, and generally unprofitable. In 1999 Mohammad Forouzandeh, a former defense minister, reported that 80% of Iran&#x27;s Bonyad companies were losing money.

Iran&#x27;s unprotected private sector has difficulty competing with Bonyad companies, whose political connections provide government permits and subsidies which eliminate worries over the need to make a profit in many market sectors. Thus Bonyads, by their very presence, hamper healthy economic competition, efficient use of capital and other resources, and growth.

===Unification of Iran&#x27;s social security system===

As charity organizations they are supposed to provide social services to the poor and the needy; however, bonyads do not fall under Iran&#x27;s General Accounting Law and, consequently, are not subject to financial audits. Unaccountable to the Central Bank governor, the bonyads &quot;jealously guard their books from prying eyes.&quot; With this lack of information for over 100 bonyads operating independently, &quot;the government doesn&#x27;t know what, why, how and to whom this help and assistance is given.&quot; Lack of proper oversight and control of these foundations has also hampered the government&#x27;s efforts in creating a comprehensive, central and unified social security system in the country, undertaken since 2003. Iran has 12 million people living below the poverty line, six million of whom are not supported by any foundation or organization.

So as to clearly distinguish its activities from the formal Social Security Organization (SSO), bonyads would have to be in charge of vocational training centers, rehabilitation centers, socioeconomic centers, all drug-related rehabilitation centers, cooperative banking (while financing these activities with the bonyads large commercial holdings, which then could be privatized). The SSO, on the other hand, could have sole responsibility for unemployment-insurance, professional-rehabilitation/training costs, retirement-pensions, disability funds, etc.

Rather than charitable organizations, the bonyads have been described as &quot;patronage-oriented holding companies that ensure the channeling of revenues to groups and milieus supporting the regime,&quot; but don&#x27;t help the poor as a class. Another complaint describes them as having kept to their charitable mission for the first decade of the Islamic Republic, but having &quot;increasingly forsaken their social welfare functions for straightforward commercial activities&quot; since the death of the revolution&#x27;s founder Ruhollah Khomeini. Local city and town bonyad have been accused of sometimes using extortionate techniques to draw the traditional Shia Islamic 20% khums donations from local business owners.

==List of major bonyads==

* Mostazafen Foundation of Islamic Revolution, one of the largest welfare organizations, is a semi-public foundation founded in 1979 with the assets of the last Shah&#x27;s family. It operates a wide variety of charitable activities with a reported $10 billion in assets (2003).

<doc id="270099" wikidata="Q458671" url="?curid=270099" title="Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit painter)">
<text>Giuseppe Castiglione, S.J. (; 19 July 1688 – 17 July 1766), was an Italian Jesuit brother and missionary in China, where he served as an artist at the imperial court of three Qing emperors – the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors. He painted in a style that is a fusion of European and Chinese traditions.

==Early life==
Castiglione was born in Milan&#x27;s San Marcellino district on 19 July 1688. He was educated at home with a private tutor, then a common practice among wealthy families. He also learned to paint under the guidance of a master. In 1707, he entered the Society of Jesus in Genoa aged 19. Although a Jesuit, he was never ordained as a priest, instead joining as a lay brother.

== Works ==
===Paintings===
In the late 17th century, a number of European Jesuit painters served in the Qing court of the Kangxi Emperor who was interested in employing European Jesuits trained in various fields, including painting. In the early 18th century, Jesuits in China made a request for a painter to be sent to the imperial court in Beijing. Castiglione was identified as a promising candidate and he accepted the post. In 1710, on the way to Lisbon, he passed through Coimbra where he stayed for several years to decorate the chapel of St. Francis Borgia in the Church of the novitiate, today the New Cathedral of Coimbra. He painted several panels in the chapel and a &quot;Circumcision of Jesus&quot; for the main altar of the same church.

In August 1715, Castiglione arrived in Macau, China, and reached Beijing later in the year. He stayed at a Jesuit church called St Joseph Mission or Eastern Hall (&quot;Dong Tang&quot;) in Chinese. He was presented to the Kangxi Emperor who viewed his painting of a dog, another source said a bird was also painted on the spot on Kangxi&#x27;s request. He was assigned a few disciples, but was placed to work as an artisan in the palace enamelling workshop.
While in China, Castiglione took the name &quot;Lang Shining&quot; (郞世寧). Castiglione adapted his European painting style to Chinese themes and taste. His earliest surviving painting created in such style was from the first year of Yongzheng&#x27;s reign in 1723. He was permitted to leave the enamel workshop by Yongzheng as it was affecting his eyesight. Although Castiglione was favoured by Yongzheng who commissioned a number of works by him, Yongzheng&#x27;s reign was a difficult period for the Jesuits as Christianity was suppressed and those missionaries not working for the emperor were expelled.

His skill as an artist was appreciated by the Qianlong Emperor, and Castiglione served the Emperor for three decades and was granted increasingly higher official rank within the Qing court. He spent many years in the court painting various subjects, including the portraits of the emperor and empress. Qianlong showed particular interest in paintings of tribute horses presented to the Emperor on which Castiglione painted a series, such as the &quot;Four Afghan Steeds&quot;.

In 1765, Castiglione and other Jesuit painters also created a series of &quot;Battle Copper Prints&quot; commissioned by the Emperor to commemorate his military campaigns. Small-scale copies of his paintings were shipped to Paris and rendered into engravings with etching before being returned to China. This series of sixteen prints by Castiglione (who contributed two) and his contemporaries Jean-Denis Attiret, Ignatius Sichelbart and Jean-Damascène Sallusti were created in this way.

Castiglione died in Beijing on 17 July 1766. An obituary was personally penned by Qianlong, who also erected a special stone in Castiglione&#x27;s memory. He was buried in the Jesuits&#x27; Zhalan Cemetery in Beijing.

===Architecture===
In addition to his skill as a painter, he was also in charge of designing the Western-Style Palaces in the imperial gardens of the Old Summer Palace with assistance from other Jesuits such as Jean-Denis Attiret. The project was initiated by Qianlong in 1747 in a garden once used by Yongzheng, with the construction of European-style palaces and gardens, aviaries, a maze, and perspective paintings organized as an outdoor theatrical stage, as well as fountains and waterworks designed by Michel Benoist. Castiglione also created &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; paintings on the walls of the palaces. The buildings, however, were destroyed in 1860 during the Second Opium War. Castiglione&#x27;s architectural works were lost, although influences of his &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; murals survive in paintings on walls and ceilings which were executed by his assistant in Juanqinzhai in Qianlong Garden in the Forbidden City.

==Style and techniques==

Castiglione&#x27;s style of painting is a unique blend of European and Chinese compositional sensibility, technique and themes. He adjusted the European style he was trained in to suit Chinese taste; for example, strong shadows used in chiaroscuro techniques were unacceptable in portraiture as the Qianlong Emperor thought that shadows looked like dirt, therefore when Castiglione painted the Emperor, the intensity of the light was reduced so that there was no shadow on the face, and the features were distinct. Emperors also preferred to have their portraits painted full face with a frontal posture; therefore, royal portraits were usually painted in such a manner.

The paintings were done on silk, and unlike European painting where mistakes can be reworked, in Chinese painting, where brushwork on silk is almost impossible to be removed, it requires careful and precise painting. The painting needed to be worked out in detail beforehand, which Castiglione did in a preparatory drawing on paper before he traced the design onto silk. An example is the most important early work by Castiglione, &quot;One Hundred Horses in a Landscape&quot; (百駿圖), for which the preparatory drawings survive. It was painted in 1728 for the Yongzheng emperor. Some of the horses are in a &#x27;flying gallop&#x27; pose, which had not been done before by European painters. The painting was executed using tempera on silk in the form of a Chinese handscroll of nearly eight metres in length. It was largely done in a European style in accordance with the rules of perspective, and with a consistent light source. However, the dramatic chiaroscuro shading typical of Baroque paintings is reduced and there are only traces of shadow under the hooves of the horses.
Castiglione was assisted in many of his paintings by a number of court painters. For example, in the painting &quot;Deer Hunting Patrol&quot; (哨鹿圖, &quot;Shaolutu&quot;), he was responsible for painting the portraits of the emperor and other officials on horseback. Other members of the hunting party, the trees and landscape were painted by other court painters in a Chinese style that is distinctly different from Castiglione&#x27;s.

==Legacy==
Due to Castiglione&#x27;s work, Qing court paintings began to show a clear Western influence. Other European painters followed and a new school of painting was created that combined Chinese and Western methods. The influence of Western art on the Qing court paintings is particularly evident in the light, shade, and perspective, as well as the priority given to recording contemporary events.

In 2005, Castiglione became the subject of the television series &quot;Palace Artist&quot; in China, played by Canadian-Chinese actor Dashan (Mark Rowswell), and broadcast by China Central Television (CCTV).. Castiglione was portrayed by Steven Thomas Boergadine in the TV series &quot;Ruyi&#x27;s Royal Love in the Palace&quot;; at the end of the 48th episode, Castiglione is seen painting the emperor and the empress together in one of the few happy episodes of the TV series.

<doc id="270160" wikidata="Q5137428" url="?curid=270160" title="Co-belligerence">
<text>Co-belligerence is the waging of a war in cooperation against a common enemy with or without a military alliance. Generally, the term is used for cases where no formal treaty of alliance exists. Likewise, allies may not become co-belligerents in a war if a &quot;casus foederis&quot; invoking the alliance has not arisen. Co-belligerents are defined in the &quot;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law&quot; as &quot;states engaged in a conflict with a common enemy, whether in alliance with each other or not&quot;.

== Legality ==
Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, nationals of a co-belligerent state are not regarded as protected persons if their state has normal diplomatic relations with an allied nation. Article 4 of the convention states:
[N]ationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are.
In other words, it isn&#x27;t a war crime under international humanitarian law for foreign co-belligerent citizens to be subjected to atrocities whether in their own territory or in occupied territory by allied belligerent troops. Much like in the time of peace, such wartime atrocities would fall under the co-belligerent nation&#x27;s domestic law or the allied belligerent&#x27;s own military law. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) commentary of 1958 stated:
The case of nationals of a co-belligerent State is simpler. They are not considered to be protected persons so long as the State whose nationals they are has normal diplomatic representation in the belligerent State or with the Occupying Power. It is assumed in this provision that the nationals of co-belligerent States, that is to say, of allies, do not need protection under the Convention.
There are certain exceptions to this rule, however. On a judgement issued on July 15, 1999 on &quot;The Prosecutor v. Duško Tadić&quot; case, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) appeals chamber noted that nationals of a co-belligerent state would be afforded the status of &quot;protected persons&quot; under the Fourth Geneva Convention if they &quot;are deprived of or do not enjoy diplomatic protection.&quot;

== Historical examples in World War II ==

=== Germany and the Soviet Union as co-belligerents in Poland ===

After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned Poland in accordance with the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Although both countries invaded Poland, they had no formal, open alliance; The pact was formally an agreement of mutual neutrality. German and Soviet cooperation against Poland in 1939 has been described as co-belligerence.

=== Finland as co-belligerent with Germany in the Continuation War ===

Co-belligerence (, ) was also the term used by the wartime government of Finland for its military co-operation with Germany (who they called their &quot;brothers-in-arms&quot;) during World War II. During the Continuation War (1941–1944), both countries had the Soviet Union as a common enemy. Finnish reentry into World War II was described as a direct consequence of Germany&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa.

While the Allies often referred to Finland as one of the Axis powers, Finland was never a signatory to the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact of September 1940. The Allies, in turn, pointed to the fact that Finland, like (Fascist) Italy and (Militarist) Japan, as well as a number of countries including neutral (Falangist) Spain, belonged to Hitler&#x27;s Anti-Comintern Pact.

Adolf Hitler declared Germany to be &quot;im Bunde&quot; (in league) with the Finns, but Finland&#x27;s government declared their intention to remain first a non-belligerent country, then co-belligerent after the Soviets started bombing Finnish cities all over the country, not the least due to a remaining neutralist public opinion. The truth was somewhere in-between:
# By mining the Gulf of Finland Finland&#x27;s navy together with the Kriegsmarine before the start of Barbarossa locked the Leningrad fleet in, making the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia practically domestic German waters, where submarines and navy could be trained without risks in addition to securing Finland&#x27;s fundamental trade routes for food and fuel.
# Germany was allowed to recruit a Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS which served under direct German command in operations away from Finnish-Soviet border. (It also recruited from non-belligerents Sweden and Spain. Germany did not recruit from countries formally allied with it until 1943 when Italy surrendered)
# The initial Finnish offensive was co-ordinated with Operation Barbarossa (see Continuation War for details of the pre-offensive staff talks).
# Finnish invasion of the Karelian Isthmus (northern part was Finnish territory until 1940) and to a lesser extent the occupation of over a half of Soviet Karelia contributed to the Siege of Leningrad. Finland also helped to block Soviet supply deliveries into the city and hosted, supplied and participated within the Lake Ladoga Flotilla which aimed to disrupt Soviet supply delivery.
# A German army corps invaded the Soviet Union from Finnish Lapland, and German army and air force units reinforced the Finnish army during the decisive 1944 battles on the Karelian isthmus. Finland and Germany executed several joint German-Finnish Operations at the Finnish front. The Finnish invasion far exceeded the territory of pre Winter War Finland. Finland occupied as far as Lake Onega and Finnish troops even crossed the river Svir for a possible link-up with German troops.
# Britain declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941.
# Germany supplied Finland with military equipment of all kinds, ranging from weapons, uniforms and helmets to tanks and assault guns. Finland in exchange delivered rare resources like nickel.
# Finland also extradited eight Jews (on orders from the then head of the State Police Arno Anthoni, who was deeply antisemitic – the Prime Minister of Finland, Paavo Lipponen issued an official apology for deportations in 2000), 76 political prisoners with non-Finnish citizenship and 2,600–2,800 prisoners of war to Germany in exchange for 2,100 Karelian and other ethnically Finnic prisoners of war from Germany. Some of the extradited had Finnish nationality but had moved to Soviet Union before the war, received Soviet citizenship and returned to Finland in secret.
# Jews were not discriminated against. A number of them served in the Finnish Army (204 during the Winter War, and about 300 during the Continuation War). When Himmler tried to persuade Finnish leaders to deport the Jews to Nazi concentration camps, the Commander-in-chief of Finland Gustaf Mannerheim is said to have replied: &quot;While Jews serve in my army I will not allow their deportation&quot;. Yad Vashem records that 22 Finnish Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, all fighting for the Finnish armed forces. Two Jewish officers of the Finnish army and one Jewish member of the Lotta Svärd women&#x27;s paramilitary organisation were awarded the German Iron Cross, but they refused to accept them.

In contrast the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty signed by Finland described Finland as having been &quot;an ally of Hitlerite Germany&quot; during the Second World War. In a 2008 poll of 28 Finnish historians carried out by &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;, 16 said that Finland had been an ally of Nazi Germany, six said it had not been, and six did not take a position.

=== The Allies as co-belligerents with former enemies ===

The term was used in 1943–45 during the latter stages of World War II to define the status of former allies and associates of Germany (Italy from 1943, Bulgaria, Romania and Finland from 1944), after they joined the Allies&#x27; war against Germany.

== Recent usage ==

In the post-9/11 era, the United States government has used the term &quot;co-belligerent&quot; to apply to certain groups connected to al Qaeda. It has done so largely as a means of tying authority to use force against those groups to a 2001 congressional statute, the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force, which Congress passed in the aftermath of 9/11 to authorize the President to use force against the group that had attacked the United States and those who harbored them, understood to be al Qaeda and the Taliban.

Since February 2022 Belarus is described as co-belligerent of Russia in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

<text>Taps and dies are tools used to create screw threads, which is called threading. Many are cutting tools; others are forming tools. A tap is used to cut or form the female portion of the mating pair (e.g. a nut). A die is used to cut or form the male portion of the mating pair (e.g. a bolt). The process of cutting or forming threads using a tap is called &quot;tapping&quot;, whereas the process using a die is called &quot;threading&quot;.

Both tools can be used to clean up a thread, which is called &quot;chasing&quot;. However, using an ordinary tap or die to clean threads generally removes some material, which results in looser, weaker threads. Because of this, machinists generally clean threads with special taps and dies—called &quot;chasers&quot;—made for that purpose. Chasers are made of softer materials and don&#x27;t cut new threads. However they still fit tighter than actual fasteners, and are fluted like regular taps and dies so debris can escape. Car mechanics, for example, use chasers on spark plug threads, to remove corrosion and carbon build-up.

==History==
While modern nuts and bolts are routinely made of metal, this was not the case in earlier ages, when woodworking tools were employed to fashion very large wooden bolts and nuts for use in winches, windmills, watermills, and flour mills of the Middle Ages; the ease of cutting and replacing wooden parts was balanced by the need to resist large amounts of torque, and bear up against ever heavier loads of weight. As the loads grew even heavier, bigger and stronger bolts were needed to resist breakage. Some nuts and bolts were measured by the foot or yard. This development eventually led to a complete replacement of wood parts with metal parts of an identical measure. When a wooden part broke, it usually snapped, ripped, or tore. With the splinters having been sanded off, the remaining parts were reassembled, encased in a makeshift mold of clay, and molten metal poured into the mold, so that an identical replacement could be made on the spot.

Metalworking taps and dies were often made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in tool making), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for hardening and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery were likely to make their own taps and dies. During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying taps and dies from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of taps and dies, starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap&#x27;s flutes with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing the state of the art (and applied science) of cutting screw threads, including those of taps and dies.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, thread standardization was evolving simultaneously with the techniques of thread generation, including taps and dies.

The largest tap and die company to exist in the United States was Greenfield Tap &amp; Die (GTD) of Greenfield, Massachusetts. GTD was so vital to the Allied war effort from 1940–1945 that anti-aircraft guns were placed around its campus in anticipation of possible Axis air attack. The GTD brand is now a part of Widia Products Group.

== Tap ==


A &quot;tap&quot; cuts or forms a thread on the inside surface of a hole, creating a female surface that functions like a nut. The three taps in the image illustrate the basic types commonly used by most machinists:

;Bottoming tap :The tap illustrated in the top of the image has a continuous cutting edge with almost no taper — between 1 and 1.5 threads of taper is typical. This feature enables a bottoming tap to cut threads to the bottom of a blind hole. A bottoming tap is usually used to cut threads in a hole that has already been partially threaded using one of the more tapered types of tap; the tapered end (&quot;tap chamfer&quot;) of a bottoming tap is too short to successfully start into an unthreaded hole. In the US, they are commonly known as bottoming taps, but in Australia and Britain they are also known as plug taps.

;Intermediate tap, second tap, or plug tap:The tap illustrated in the middle of the image has tapered cutting edges, which assist in aligning and starting the tap into an untapped hole. The number of tapered threads typically ranges from 3 to 5. Plug taps are the most commonly used type of tap. In the US, they are commonly known as plug taps, whereas in Australia and Britain they are commonly known as second taps.

;Taper tap: The small tap illustrated at the bottom of the image is similar to an intermediate tap but has a more pronounced taper to the cutting edges. This feature gives the taper tap a very gradual cutting action that is less aggressive than that of the plug tap. The number of tapered threads typically ranges from 8 to 10. A taper tap is most often used when the material is difficult to work (e.g., alloy steel) or the tap is of a very small diameter and thus prone to breakage.

;Power taps: The above taps are generally referred to as hand taps, since they are manually operated. During operation, the machinist must periodically reverse a hand tap to break the chip (also known as swarf) that forms from cutting. This prevents the cut material from &quot;crowding&quot; and breaking the tap.

:The most common type of power driven tap is the &quot;spiral point&quot; plug tap, also referred to as a &quot;gun&quot; tap, whose cutting edges are angularly displaced relative to the tap centerline. This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. Spiral point taps are usually used in holes that go all the way through the material, so that the chips can escape. Another version of the spiral point plug tap is the spiral flute tap, whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill. Spiral flute taps are widely used in high speed, automatic tapping operations due to their ability to work well in blind holes.

;Forming tap: A quite different kind of tap is a forming tap. A forming tap, aka a fluteless tap or roll tap, forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal from the sides of the hole as cutting taps do. A forming tap has lobes periodically spaced around the tap which actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole, and the threads behind the lobes are slightly recessed to reduce contact friction. Since there is no need to provide space for chips, these recesses are much more subtle than a cutting tap&#x27;s flutes and the tap appears very nearly just like a plain thread. Since the tap does not produce chips, there is no need to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which can jam and break a cutting tap if allowed to accumulate. This problem is particularly acute in blind holes, so thread forming is particularly suited to such applications. Forming taps only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the tap drill size is larger than that used for a cutting tap as shown in most tap drill tables, and an accurate hole size is required; a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.

===Holes===

Whether manual or automatic, the processing of tapping begins with forming (usually by drilling) and slightly countersinking a hole to a diameter somewhat smaller than the tap&#x27;s major diameter. The correct hole diameter is listed on a drill and tap size chart, a standard reference in many machine shops. The proper diameter for the drill is called the tap drill size. Without a tap drill chart, you can compute the correct tap drill diameter with:
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the tap drill size, formula_3 is the major diameter of the tap (e.g., in for a -16 tap), and formula_4 is the thread pitch ( inch in the case of a -16 tap). For a -16 tap, the above formula would produce , which is the correct tap drill diameter. The above formula ultimately results in an approximate 75% thread.

Since metric threads specify the pitch directly, the correct tap drill diameter for metric-sized taps is computed with:
:formula_5
where formula_2 is the tap drill size, formula_3 is the major diameter of the tap (e.g., 10 mm for a M10×1.5 tap), and pitch is the pitch of the thread (1.5 mm in the case of a standard M10 tap) and so the correct drill size is 8.5 mm. This works for both fine and coarse pitches, and also produces an approximate 75% thread.

===Tap sequence===

With soft or average hardness materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, common practice is to use an intermediate (plug) tap to cut the threads. If the threads must extend to the bottom of a blind hole, the machinist uses an intermediate (plug) tap to cut threads until the point of the tap reaches bottom, and then switches to a bottoming tap to finish. The machinist must frequently eject chips to avoid jamming or breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the torque required to cut threads. To threads to the bottom of a blind hole, the machinist follows the taper tap with an intermediate (plug) tap, and then a bottoming tap to finish.

===Machine tapping===
Tapping may either be achieved by a hand tapping by using a set of taps (first tap, second tap &amp; final (finish) tap) or using a machine to do the tapping, such as a lathe, radial drilling machine, bench type drill machine, pillar type drill machine, vertical milling machines, HMCs, VMCs. Machine tapping is faster, and generally more accurate because human error is eliminated. Final tapping is achieved with single tap.

Although in general machine tapping is more accurate, tapping operations have traditionally been very tricky to execute due to frequent tap breakage and inconsistent quality of tapping.

Common reasons for tap breakage are:

* Tap-related problems:
** Wearing of tap cannot be easily quantified (use of worn-out taps)
** Use of tap with improper tap geometry for a particular application.
** Use of non-standard or inferior quality taps.
* Clogging with chips.
* Misalignment between tap and hole.
* Over- or under-feeding the tap, causing breakage in tension or compression.
* Use of improper and/or insufficient cutting lubricant.
* Absence of a torque limiting feature.
* Improper or zero float for use with screw machines (recommended feed .1 slower to establish float for 40 tpi or higher and .15 slower for 40 tpi or finer)
* Improper spindle speed.

To overcome these problems, special tool holders are required to minimize the chances of tap breakage during tapping. These are usually classified as conventional tool holders and CNC tool holders.

===Tool holders for tapping operations===
Various tool holders may be used for tapping depending on the requirements of the user:

====Aids for hand-tapping (simple jigs and fixtures)====
The biggest problem with simple hand-tapping is accurately aligning the tap with the hole so that they are coaxial—in other words, going in straight instead of on an angle. The operator must get this alignment close to ideal to produce good threads and not break the tap. The deeper the thread depth, the more pronounced the effect of the angular error. With a depth of 1 or 2 diameters, it matters little. With depths beyond 2 diameters, the error becomes too pronounced to ignore. Another fact about alignment is that the first thread cut or two establishes the direction that the rest of the threads will follow. You can&#x27;t correct the angle after the first thread or two.

To help with this alignment task, several kinds of jigs and fixtures can be used to provide the correct geometry (i.e., accurate coaxiality with the hole) without having to use freehand skill to approximate it:

* Hand-tapper: A simple fixture analogous to an arbor press in its basic shape. Its spindle is thus held accurately perpendicular to the work. Standard taps are held in the spindle, and the operator turns the spindle manually via a handlebar. This fixture obviates the need for the operator to carefully and skillfully approximate perpendicularity, which even for a skilled operator can easily result in a 2–5° error.
* Tapping guide, or &quot;tap and reamer aligner/holder&quot;, a simple conical guide slipped over a tap when using a regular tap handle. As with a hand-tapper, the basic principle is simply that of a jig or fixture to provide the correct alignment.

====Heads for machine tool spindles====
* Tapping attachments: these may be normal (available in a range of tap sizes) or quick-change
* Quick-change drilling and tapping chucks (variations available for both CNC and manual-control tools)
* Rigid tapping attachments (for CNC)

Generally the following features are required of tapping holders:
* Twin chucking: tap is held at points of both its circular and square cross-section. Gripping the circular section assures concentricity to the machine spindle, and gripping the square produces positive rotational drive.
* Safety clutch: The built in safety mechanism operates as soon as the set torque limit is attained to save the tap from breakage.
* Float radial parallel: small misalignments are taken care of by this float.
* Length compensation: built in length compensation takes care of small push or pull to the spindle or feed difference.

Tapping case studies with typical examples of tapping operations in various environments are shown on source machinetoolaid.com 

====Tapping stations====
* Tapping stations are worktables with a tapping head attached to the end of a pantograph-style arm similar to that of a balanced-arm lamp. The operator guides the tapping head to each (already-drilled) hole and quickly taps it.
* &quot;Drilling and tapping centers&quot;, whose name sounds similar to that of tapping stations, are actually light-duty, affordable machining centers of 2, 2.5, or 3 axes that are designed for a life of mainly drilling and tapping with limited milling use.

Double-lead taps and insert taps need different speeds and feeds, and different starting hole diameters than other taps. 

===Tap drill sizes===


===US tap and drill bit size and reference chart===

A comprehensive reference for US tap and drill bit sizes can be found in the chart provided by Albany County Fasteners. This chart includes detailed specifications for machine screw size, threads per inch, major and minor diameters, and appropriate drill sizes for different materials.

== Die ==
A &quot;die&quot; cuts an external thread on cylindrical material, such as a rod, which creates a male threaded piece that functions like a bolt. Dies are generally made in two styles: solid and adjustable.
An adjustable die may be adjusted either by an integrated screw or by a set of screws set in to the die holder (termed a &quot;die stock&quot;). 
Integral adjusting screws may be arranged to work axially, where the movement of the adjusting screw into a threaded hole in the die forces the slit section of the die open, or tangentially where a screw threaded in to one side of the slit bears against the opposite side of the slit. 
Dies without integrated screws are adjusted inside the die stock by radially-arranged screws. Two screws in the stock bear in to indentations on either side of the slit, tending to squeeze the slit closed, whilst a third screw with a tapered tip screws in to the slit forcing it open. Working these three screws against each other adjusts the die. 

Integrated screws appear to be common in the US but are almost unknown in the UK and Europe. 

The dies shown in the image to the right are adjustable:
* top left: an older split die, with top adjusting screw
* bottom left: a one piece die with top adjusting screw
* center: a one piece die with side adjusting screw (barely visible on the full image)
* right: two dies without integrated adjusting screws

Solid dies cut a nominal thread form and depth, whose accuracy is subject to the precision the die was made with, and the effects of wear. Adjustable dies can be slightly compressed or expanded to provide some compensation for wear, or to achieve different classes of thread fit (class A, B and more rarely, C). Adjustable taps also exist but are not common. These have a tip that is split through the flutes and an axial screw which forces the cutting edges slightly apart. 

The work piece (blank) to be threaded, which is usually slightly smaller in diameter than the die&#x27;s major diameter, is given a slight taper (chamfer) at the end that is to be threaded. This chamfer helps center the die on the blank and reduces the force required to start the thread cutting. Once the die has started, it self-feeds. Periodic reversal of the die is often required to break the chip and prevent crowding.

&quot;s&quot;, also known as &quot;rethreading dies&quot;, are dies made for cleaning up damaged threads, have no split for resizing and are made from a hexagonal bar so that a wrench may be used to turn them. The process of repairing damaged threads is referred to as &quot;chasing.&quot; Rethreading dies cannot be used to cut new threads as they lack chip forming teeth. However the external profile of a die does not strictly map to its function. Manufacturers of dies have produced models in a hex form which are intended for the creation of new threads. These appear identical to solid dies in all aspects besides the external shape. Hexagonal thread cutting dies are used with a die stock with hexagonal holding features.

==Lubricants==
The use of a suitable lubricant is essential with most tapping and threading operations. Recommended lubricants for some common materials are as follows:
; Carbon (mild) steel: Petroleum-based or synthetic cutting oil.
; Alloy steel: Petroleum-based cutting oil mixed with a small amount (approximately 10 percent) of kerosene or mineral spirits. This mixture is also suitable for use with stainless steel.
; Cast iron: No lubricant. A low velocity air blast should be used to clear chips.
; Aluminium: Kerosene or mineral spirits mixed with a small amount (15–25 percent) of petroleum-based cutting oil. In some cases, products such as WD-40, CRC 5-56 and 3-In-One Oil are acceptable substitutes.
; Brass: Kerosene or mineral spirits.
; Bronze: Kerosene or mineral spirits mixed with a small amount (10–15 percent) of petroleum-based cutting oil.

<text>Marking blue or layout stain (sometimes called &quot;Dykem&quot; after trademark erosion of a popular brand, or &quot;Prussian blue&quot; after the blue pigment) is a dye used in metalworking to aid in marking out rough parts for further machining. It is used to stain or paint a metal object with a very thin layer of dye that can be scratched off using a scriber or other sharp instrument to reveal a bright, yet very narrow line in the metal underneath.

== Composition ==

Marking blue is made by mixing methylated spirits with shellac and gentian violet. 

== Alternatives ==

A felt tip marker can be used as they are convenient and tend not to dry up as quickly. On rough structures, such as castings or forgings, whitewash or a mixture of chalk and water can be used. A solution of copper sulfate, distilled water, and a few drops of sulfuric acid can be used on machined surfaces.
