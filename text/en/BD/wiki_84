<text>Ghent University (, abbreviated as UGent) is a public research university located in Ghent, Belgium.

Located in Flanders, Ghent University is the second largest Belgian university, consisting of 50,000 students and 9,000 staff members. The university also supports the Ghent University Library (including the famous Boekentoren) and the Ghent University Hospital, which is one of the biggest hospitals in Belgium. In addition to satellite campuses elsewhere in Flanders and a Global Campus in Songdo, South Korea, Ghent University maintains many inter-university partnerships and programs both inside and outside of Europe.

Established before the state of Belgium itself, the university was founded by the Dutch King William I in 1817, when the region was incorporated into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands after the fall of First French Empire. In that same year, he founded two other universities for the southern provinces as well, alongside Ghent University: University of Liège and State University of Leuven.

After the Belgian revolution of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer Ghent University. In 1930, UGent became the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. Previously, French (and, even earlier, Latin) had been the standard academic language in what was Université de Gand. In 1991, it was granted major autonomy and changed its name accordingly from &quot;State University of Ghent&quot; (, abbreviated as &quot;RUG&quot;) to its current designation.

== History ==
=== Foundation in the 19th century ===
Ghent was one of the largest and most important cities of Europe in the medieval period.

The university in Ghent was opened on 9 October 1817, with JC van Rotterdam as the first rector. The foundation of universities in Ghent, Liege, and Leuven that year – by the Dutch King William I – was part of a larger policy to stimulate academic lag across the southern provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (which would later become Belgium). The original four faculties comprised Humanities (Letters), Law, Medicine, and Science, with the language of instruction being Latin. In the first year, it had 190 students and 16 professors. 

In the wake of the Belgian Revolution, of 1830, the number of students declined, having peaked at 414. Although the faculties of humanities and science were dissolved from the university, they were restored five years later, in 1835. At this time, French also became the language of instruction, taking the place of Latin.

Ghent University played a role in the foundation of modern organic chemistry. Friedrich August Kekulé unraveled the structure of benzene at Ghent and Adolf von Baeyer (Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer), a student of August Kekulé, made contributions to organic chemistry.

In 1882, Sidonie Verhelst became the first female student at Ghent University, in science and pharmacology.
=== Developments in the 20th century ===
In 1903, the Flemish politician Lodewijk De Raet led a successful campaign to begin instruction in Dutch, and the first courses were begun in 1906.

During World War I, Ghent University was initially closed due to hostilities and subsequently due to the refusal of the academic staff and the students to resume classes while Belgium was occupied. Moritz von Bissing, the German Governor-General of occupied Belgium sought to make the territory easier to govern by exploiting the pre-war linguistic division. The &quot;Flamenpolitik&quot; (&quot;Policy regarding the Flemish people&quot;) was launched in 1916. The occupying German administration set up the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium in Ghent under the name Vlaamsche Hoogeschool (Flemish Institute of Higher Learning). Pejoratively referred to as the &quot;Von Bissing University&quot;, the Vlaamsche Hoogeschool was founded in 1916 but was disestablished after the war and the University of Ghent resumed its activities with French as the sole medium of instruction. In 1923, Cabinet Minister Pierre Nolf put forward a motion to definitively establish the university as a Dutch-speaking university, and this was realized in 1930. August Vermeylen served as the first rector of a Dutch-language university in Belgium.In the Second World War, the German administration of the university attempted to create a German orientation, removing faculty members and installing loyal activists.
In the postwar period, Ghent University became a much larger institution, following the government policy of democratizing higher education in Flanders during the 1950s and 1960s. By 1953, there were more than 3,000 students, and by 1969 more than 11,500.

The number of faculties increased to eleven, starting with Applied Sciences in 1957. It was followed by Economics and Veterinary Medicine in 1968, Psychology and Pedagogy, as well as Bioengineering, in 1969, and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

In the 1960s, there were several student demonstrations at Ghent University, notably around the Blandijn site, which houses the Faculty of Arts &amp; Philosophy. The most severe of demonstrations took place in 1969 in the wake of May 1968.

=== Since the end of the Cold War ===
In 1991, the university officially changed its name from &quot;Rijksuniversiteit Gent&quot; (RUG) to &quot;Universiteit Gent&quot; (UGent), following an increased grant of autonomy by the government of the Flemish Community. The faculty of Politics and Social Sciences is the most recent addition, in 1992.

Ghent University had a program founded by Andre Vlerick in 1953, then called &quot;Centre for Productivity Studies and Research&quot;. The program later evolved into a separate school called &quot;Instituut Professor Vlerick voor Management&quot;. Later in 1999 together with KU Leuven, Ghent University established Vlerick Business School merging the two MBA programs of the universities, naming the newborn institute &quot;Vlerick Leuven Gent Management School&quot;. In 2006, the school rebranded itself as Vlerick Business School. KU Leuven and Ghent University are still the parent institutions of the business school where many of the school&#x27;s professors teach also in Leuven or Ghent. Nevertheless, UGent still offer MBA programs even after the merger.

== Academic profile ==
=== Organisation and structure ===
Ghent University consists of eleven faculties with over 130 individual departments. In addition, the university maintains the Zwijnaarde science park and Greenbridge science park.

=== Library ===
Standing on the Blandijnberg, the Boekentoren houses the Ghent University Library, which contains nearly 3 million volumes. The university library has joined the Google Books Library Project. Among other notable collections, it preserves Papyrus 30, an early manuscript of the Greek New Testament.

The university is also a partner in the development of De Krook, the new public library and media center in the center of Ghent that opened in 2017.

=== Reputation &amp; rankings ===

Ghent University consistently ranks among the top 100 universities in the world, alongside the Catholic University of Leuven. In 2017, it was ranked, globally, 69th by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (or Shanghai ranking) and 125th by &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;. For 2021, Ghent University has been ranked, worldwide, 85th by U.S. News &amp; World Report and 96th by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;. The Faculty of Economics and Business Administration has also been awarded with an international Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation.

=== International relations ===
The university maintains many partnerships within Belgium, across Europe, and throughout the world.

Inside Belgium, Ghent University supports the Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-organisms and the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie.

Within Europe, it is a member of the Santander Network, the Enlight (previously the U4) Network, and the 3i University Network. It also participates in the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research. In addition, the university cooperates with numerous universities for the Erasmus and Erasmus Mundus programs; within the framework of the latter, it heads the International Master of Science in Rural Development and the International Master of Science in Soils and Global Change (IMSOGLO).

Beyond Europe, Ghent University conducts exchange programs on all six continents. Frameworks include its campus in South Korea and its 3C Partnership.

<text>The River Churnet is a river in Staffordshire, England. It is a tributary of the River Dove.

== Etymology ==

The origins of the name &quot;Churnet&quot; are unknown, though it is thought to derive from the pre-English, British name for the river.

== Course ==

The source of the river is located over above sea level in the Staffordshire moorlands, near the gritstone escarpment of the Roaches, and next to the A53 Leek to Buxton road, It is only a few hundred yards away from Black Brook which ultimately, through the Dane and Weaver, flows into the Irish Sea; however, the Churnet, through the Dove, Trent and Humber Estuary, ultimately flows into the North Sea.

After flowing downhill for a few miles it reaches Tittesworth Reservoir, a major supplier of fresh water to the Potteries and Leek. After it leaves the dam at Tittesworth, it flows into the ancient market town of Leek, where it was used until quite recently to aid the manufacture of dyes that were used in the town&#x27;s textile and silk industries. South of Cheddleton, the river flows through the Churnet Valley, an area of outstanding beauty with ancient woodland, an abundance of wildlife and industrial heritage.

The Caldon Canal locks into the river at Oak Meadow Ford Lock, 2 miles on from Cheddleton and river and canal are one until Consall Forge, where the canal goes its own way again. The river continues through the valley, past ancient woodland and the Bolton Copper works at Froghall, then through the villages of Oakamoor and Alton. It flows past the JCB factory at Rocester and shortly afterwards joins the River Dove near the hamlet of Combridge.

== Churnet Valley ==

The course of the river from Cheddleton to Rocester runs through the Churnet Valley – a part of Staffordshire that has been known either as Staffordshire&#x27;s Rhineland or Staffordshire&#x27;s Little Switzerland. Throughout the valley there are steep gorges and banks, with an abundance of woodland and Wildlife. There are several woods owned by the National Trust and the RSPB.

== Industry ==

The Churnet has been heavily influenced by industry along its length for nearly a thousand years and as a result became possibly the most polluted river in Europe. The river was heavily used in Leek by the textile industry to make dyes. The dyeing industry was established in 1734 and it was claimed that the water from the Churnet was the finest in Europe for this purpose. In nearby Cheddleton the Churnet was used to power a flint mill that ground down flint for use in the pottery industry. Further downriver at Froghall and at Oakamoor the Thomas Bolton Copper works used the power of the Churnet to help manufacture the world&#x27;s first transatlantic telegraph cables. The processes involved in manufacturing copper wire at the sites caused high levels of pollution.

The Churnet Valley was heavily involved in the iron-smelting industry and it is documented from as long ago as 1290 that iron was smelted using the river as its main source of energy.
The early forges were at East Wall, near Oakamoor, but a later forge is still standing at Consall, next to the locks on the Caldon Canal.

The Caldon Canal runs with the river through the Churnet Valley and along parts the river is canalised. There was intensive freight traffic on the waterway transporting limestone and ironstone from the wharves on the canal. Today the only industrial use of the river is by the sand quarry at Oakamoor.

Since the decline of industry in Leek and the Churnet Valley, the quality of the water has improved so much that a programme of re-introducing salmon is underway.

<text>The American Astronomical Society (AAS, sometimes spoken as &quot;double-A-S&quot;) is an American society of professional astronomers and other interested individuals, headquartered in Washington, DC. The primary objective of the AAS is to promote the advancement of astronomy and closely related branches of science, while the secondary purpose includes enhancing astronomy education and providing a political voice for its members through lobbying and grassroots activities. Its current mission is to enhance and share humanity&#x27;s scientific understanding of the universe as a diverse and inclusive astronomical community.

== History ==

The society was founded in 1899 through the efforts of George Ellery Hale. The constitution of the group was written by Hale, George Comstock, Edward Morley, Simon Newcomb and Edward Charles Pickering. These men, plus four others, were the first Executive Council of the society; Newcomb was the first president. The initial membership was 114. The AAS name of the society was not finally decided until 1915, previously it was the &quot;Astronomical and Astrophysical Society of America&quot;. One proposed name that preceded this interim name was &quot;American Astrophysical Society&quot;.

The AAS today has over 8,000 members and six divisions – the Division for Planetary Sciences (1968), the Division on Dynamical Astronomy (1969), the High Energy Astrophysics Division (1969), the Solar Physics Division (1969), the Historical Astronomy Division (1980) and the Laboratory Astrophysics Division (2012). The membership includes physicists, mathematicians, geologists, engineers and others whose research interests lie within the broad spectrum of subjects now comprising contemporary astronomy. The annual meeting of the AAS is held in the spring and constitutes the largest gathering of astronomers, numbering over 3,000 in 2023.

In 2019 three AAS members were selected into the tenth anniversary class of TED Fellows.

The AAS established the AAS Fellows program in 2019 to &quot;confer recognition upon AAS members for achievement and extraordinary service to the field of astronomy and the American Astronomical Society.&quot; The inaugural class was designated by the AAS Board of Trustees and includes an initial group of 232 Legacy Fellows.

In January 2025, AAS published a statement calling on nations to ban advertising from space that can be seen from the ground amid growing concern around the launch obtrusive space advertising payloads.

== Divisions ==

Because the field of astronomy is diverse, several divisions have been formed each of which promotes and enables a different branch of astronomy or astronomy-related science as well as working within the overall charter of the AAS. Many of the divisions hold separate meetings in addition to meeting with the main group. The divisions of the AAS, together with their main research interests, are:

* The Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS) supports planetology and exploration of the Solar System.
* The Division on Dynamical Astronomy (DDA) supports research on the dynamics (orbits, evolution, and history) of astronomical systems from the Solar System to superclusters of galaxies on cosmological scales.
* The High Energy Astrophysics Division (HEAD) supports knowledge about high energy events, particles, quanta, relativistic gravitational fields, and related phenomena in the astrophysical universe.
* The Historical Astronomy Division (HAD) supports topics relevant to the history of astronomy as a field, and research using historical astronomical records to solve current problems in astronomy.
* The Solar Physics Division (SPD) supports solar physics (astrophysical research on the Sun), and its interactions with the Solar System and Earth.
* In 2012, a new division was formed: the Laboratory Astrophysics Division (LAD) to advance humanity&#x27;s understanding of the Universe through the promotion of fundamental theoretical and experimental research into the underlying processes that drive the Universe.

== Publications ==

* &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot;
* &quot;Astronomy Education Review [no longer published]&quot;
* &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot;
* &quot;The Planetary Science Journal&quot;
* &quot;Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society&quot;
* &quot;Research Notes of the AAS&quot; (scientific publication of brief communications, non peer-reviewed)
*&quot;AAS Nova&quot;, an online publication with highlights from the research journals of the Society.
*In June 2019 AAS announced that it would be the new publisher of &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot;.
*In August 2020 AAS announced that it had acquired the inventory, author contracts and related assets of Willmann-Bell, Inc. a publisher of astronomical books, atlases and software.

== Prizes ==

*The Henry Norris Russell Lectureship, for lifetime achievement in astronomy

<doc id="268043" wikidata="Q771765" url="?curid=268043" title="Tioman Island">
<text>Tioman Island () is off the east coast of Rompin District, Pahang, Malaysia. It is long and wide and has seven villages, the largest and most populous being Kampung Tekek on the central western coast. The densely forested island is sparsely inhabited, and is surrounded by numerous coral reefs, making it a popular scuba diving, snorkelling, and surfing spot. There are many resorts and chalets for tourists around the island, which has duty-free status.

The island is accessed via ferry service from the coastal town of Mersing and Teluk Gading, as well as by air, run by a regular private service from Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (formerly Subang International Airport) in Selangor.

==History==

Tioman has been used for thousands of years by Austronesian fishermen as an essential navigation point and a source of fresh water and wood. During the past thousand years, it has played host to Chinese, Arab, and European trading ships en route to Champa, and often Chinese porcelain shards can be found on beaches around the island.

In more recent history, Tioman played host to both the British and the Japanese navies during the Second World War. As a result, the waters around the island are littered with war remains, including HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; and HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;.

Tioman island does not allow buildings to have more than three stories. Tioman Island is to be granted municipality status soon.

==Nature==
The marine area around Tioman Island and eight other nearby islands have been declared as marine parks and marine reserves.

Apart from its diverse marine life, the inland rainforest area was protected in 1972 as the Pulau Tioman Wildlife Reserve. However, a large part of the original reserve was sacrificed for agricultural and touristic development in 1984; the remaining area is approximately . There are several protected species of mammals on the island, including the binturong, long-tailed macaque, slow loris, black giant squirrel, red giant flying squirrel, mouse deer, brush-tailed porcupine, and common palm civet, from a total of 45 species of mammals and 138 species of birds, including the majestic frigatebird. Moreover, Tioman has species that are endemic to its shores. The Tioman walking catfish &quot;Clarias batu&quot; can be seen on rainforest walks. Kajang slender litter frog is only known from Mount Kajang.

Tioman Island Marine Park hosts three marine ecosystems: coral reef, seagrass bed, and mangrove forest. The coral reefs accommodate 350 species of scleractinian corals from 67 genera including three endangered species (Alveopora minuta, Isopora togianensis and Pectinia maxima), 86 vulnerable species and 85 near threatened species, 326 species of coral reef fish from 55 families including the endangered humphead wrasse, vulnerable blacktip reef shark, slender bambooshark, tawny nurse shark, brown-marbled grouper, squaretail coral grouper, finless sleeper ray, Jenkin&#x27;s whipray and the near threatened blackspot tuskfish and Bower&#x27;s parrotfish, and 76 taxa of benthic macroalgae. The seagrass beds support 3 species of seagrass and can be found near Kampung Air Batang, Kampung Genting, Teluk Nipah, Teluk Mukut and between Japamala Resort and Pasir Cina. The mangrove forests, a total of 59.90 hectares, support 23 mangrove species including a new hybrid species, one endangered species (Heritiera globose) which can be found near Kampung Genting and Kampung Juara and two near threatened species (Ceriops decandra and Sonneratia ovata) which can be found near Kampung Juara.

==Impacts==

Tioman&#x27;s corals have been affected by a mass bleaching event in 2010 whereby the island lost a significant portion of its live coral cover. That resulted in many corals turning a dull white colour and some even fragmenting into pieces of dead coral skeleton. The 2016 bleaching event only just touched on Tioman&#x27;s Coral Reefs, and as such, the coral has remained in good and healthy condition.

A proposal to build an international airport on Tioman Island which were rejected by authorities in 2018 due to the scale of the environmental impacts it would cause are still very much in the works as an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the project has been submitted. The new airport would cover 186.4 hectares (460.6 acres) of the island&#x27;s west coast between the villages of Kampung Paya and Kampung Genting. 76% of the development area would need to be land reclaimed from the sea (142.70 hectares) within Pulau Tioman Marine Park, according to the EIA report. Impacts on the marine environment cited in the EIA report include direct destruction of coral reefs and coastal habitats, underwater construction noise, pollutant runoff, artificial lighting, and plumes of silt and sediment. The development could displace local businesses, extinguish tourism revenue in two of the island&#x27;s seven villages, and have cascading effects on the island&#x27;s already limited natural resource.

The EIA report suggests carrying out a marine conservation and rehabilitation plan, which involves relocating and propagating corals to four designated sites and two coral farms before any construction begins. While the relocation of corals may appear to be a measure to protect these fragile organisms, it is important to examine the drawbacks and limitations of this approach. Relocating corals from their natural habitats to new sites can have an adverse effect on their survival and the ecosystems they support. Transplanted corals often struggle to adapt to new conditions, leading to a high mortality rate. The disturbance caused by relocation can disrupt the balance of the ecosystem and result in long-term ecological consequences.

The EIA report states that 54% of 300 island residents surveyed about the development viewed the development positively. However, the report concedes that many respondents were residents of Kampung Tekek, a village in the northern, most developed part of the island, far from the development footprint and close to a large resort linked to the project developer. In contrast, representatives surveyed from the affected villages of Kampung Genting and Kampung Paya typically held a negative view of the airport proposal.

The EIA report was prepared by Asia Pacific Environmental Consultants Sdn. Bhd. for Tioman Infra Sdn. Bhd., a subsidiary part-owned by the Berjaya Group, a Malaysia-based corporation that also operates a resort on the island. The project developer is Tioman Infra Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tioman Hill Resort Sdn Bhd which is 50% owned by Berjaya Group. The rest is owned by the royal family of Pahang through Aimvesco Sdn Bhd and the late Sultan Ahmad Shah.

Ghost nets are becoming increasingly common around the island, harming local wildlife.

==Legend==

According to legend, Tioman Island is the resting place of a beautiful dragon princess. Whilst flying to visit her prince in Singapore, this beautiful maiden stopped to seek solace in the crystal-clear waters of the South China Sea. Enraptured by the charms of the place, she decided to discontinue her journey. By taking the form of an island, she pledged to offer shelter and comfort to passing travellers.

Local mythology claims that the island is the embodiment of the mighty dragon Sri Gumom. The dragon was on his way to visit his sister Gunung Linga (Lingin Peak). Still, the great Sri Rama forbade the meeting, and Sri Gumom was turned into a stone and fell into the deep sea where he now remains, frozen in eternity as this beautiful island with its distinctive topography.

<doc id="268059" wikidata="Q1469595" url="?curid=268059" title="Tsing Yi">
<text>Tsing Yi (), sometimes referred to as Tsing Yi Island, is an island in the New Territories of Hong Kong, to the northwest of Hong Kong Island and south of Tsuen Wan. With an area of , the island has been extended drastically by reclamation along almost all its natural shore and the annexation of Nga Ying Chau () and Chau Tsai. Three major bays or harbours, Tsing Yi Lagoon, Mun Tsai Tong, and Tsing Yi Bay () in the northeast, have been completely reclaimed for new towns.

The island is generally zoned into four quarters: the northeast quarter is a residential area, the southeast quarter is Tsing Yi Town, the southwest holds heavy industry, and the northwest includes a recreation trail, a transportation interchange and some dockyards and ship building industry. The island is in the northwest of Victoria Harbour and part of its coastline is subject to the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance.

== Etymology==


Tsing Yi () literally means &quot;green/ blue/ black clothes&quot;, but is also a kind of fish, most likely blackspot tuskfish, once abundant in nearby waters. People named the island after the fish. Tsing Yi Tam (, Tsing Yi Deep Pool) or Tsing Yi Tam Shan (, Tsing Yi Deep Pool Hill) also appeared on some early Chinese maps.

The island was also known as Chun Fa Lok () once upon a time, which means &quot;the fall of spring flowers&quot;, or Chun Fa Island, on some Western maps. Now, Chun Fa Lok is still a place name or a former village on the southeast corner of the island. A government document in the Ming Dynasty named the water near Chun Fa Lok, Chun Fa Yeung (), which is &quot;the ocean of spring flowers&quot;. The Ming navy once defeated pirate fleets there.

In some historical sources, Tsing-I Island is used instead of &quot;Tsing Yi Island&quot;, and Chung-Hue Island instead of &quot;Chun Fa Island&quot;.

==Administration==
Tsing Yi Town, together with Kwai Chung Town, is part of Tsuen Wan New Town in the Kwai Tsing District in the New Territories. Although Tsing Yi Island is a &quot;de facto&quot; outlying island, it is not accordingly included in the Islands District.

Historically, Tsing Yi Island, with Kwai Chung, were usually in the same administration unit as Tsuen Wan because of their proximity and close-knit neighbourhood. Unlike Kwai Chung, whose villages are part of Tsuen Wan Rural Committee, Tsing Yi Island has its own, Tsing Yi Rural Committee. The rural committee was politically significant until the establishment of a District Council and Regional Council (now-abolished), and even less significant since the urban population grew much larger than the rural population.

==Population==
There were about 4,000 people on the island when the British took the New Territories around 1898. In the following one hundred years, the population has grown to nearly 50 times this size; the 2001 Census calculating that the population of the island was 193,432 in 55,478 households. In an estimation in 2007, there are about 200,400 people. It is expected to grow to 203,300 in the near future. Most of the population live in Tsing Yi Town.

==Geography==
Tsing Yi Island is a hilly island with Tsing Yi Peak in the south and Liu To Shan in the north east. Small plain can be found surrounding the former Tsing Yi Lagoon in island northeast. The rocks on the island are mainly granite and were exposed due to extensive housing, industrial and infrastructure construction. Although the island is not fallen in the administration of country park, most of the hilly area remains green. The Tsing Yi Peak climbs to and is a barrier separating industrial west and residential east.

==Nature==
The hilly area of the island largely remains intact and is designated as a green belt. In 1997 a once lost endemic plant, Hong Kong croton, was found in the woodland beneath the highest peak, Tsing Yi Peak, on the island.

==History==

In the early days, the inhabitants on the island were mostly farmers and fishermen. The major population concentrated in the northeast portion of the island. Farmers grew rice, vegetables and pineapples, while fishermen lived in huts connected by plank walkways in the small harbour of Tsing Yi Tong which stretched far back into the island. Many fishermen also lived on their junks and boats all the time, fishing in the nearby waters. Even as late as the 1970s, Tsing Yi Tong resembled Tai O with its characteristic stilt houses and water vehicles. Like many other fishing villages in Hong Kong, the Tsing Yi dwellers worshipped Tin Hau, the goddess of mercy and the sea. A Tin Hau Temple was built on the shore of Tsing Yi Tong. At the birthday of Tin Hau, fishermen of all nearby waters would come to the Temple for celebrations. The temple was white in color and thus people call it &quot;Pak Miu&quot; (, ).

From the 1920s onwards, a Chinese company built lime factories on the present site of Greenfield Garden. It is the earliest known industry on the island. The lime industry continued to flourish during the 1950s, and a tanning factory was also founded at the same period. After World War II, other heavy industries moved in as well. In the 1960s, several oil companies moved their oil storage depots onto the island and a Green Island Cement cement plant. CLP later commissioned its 1520MW oil-fired Tsing Yi Power Station in 1969 at Nam Wan due to its proximity to the oil tank farms. Meanwhile, some small shipbuilding companies opened on Tsing Yi, and remain on the north side of the island. In the 1970s, six large-scale companies on the island collectively built the Tsing Yi Bridge to connect Tsing Yi Town and Kwai Chung Town over the Rambler Channel. The bridge was soon transferred to the Hong Kong Government, remaining the sole road connection to the island for more than ten years. Several industrial buildings for light industries were constructed beside the bridge afterward. Several dockyards moved to the west shore of the island at the end of the 1970s.

During the 1950s, Wok Tai Wan on Tsing Yi Island was a paradise for nudists, and hence Tsing Yi was once synonymous with nudism in Hong Kong.

After the establishment of the Tsing Yi Bridge, the Hong Kong government commenced an extensive new town project on the island. Cheung Ching Estate, Cheung Hong Estate and Mayfair Gardens were consequently built in heaps. The vicinity of the Mobil oil storage depot to Mayfair Garden and Cheung Ching Estate once aroused enormous concern for the safety of the residents. Some social workers and residents urged the government to relocate the storage facilities. The government decided to halt the last phase of the Mayfair Garden development scheme. The storage facility remained at the same location until Container Terminal 9 was on the government&#x27;s agenda.

Later on, the tenor of town development shifted northward. Two fisherman harbours, Tsing Yi Tong and Mun Tsai Tong were reclaimed for residential use. Many fishermen were relocated from their boats parked in the typhoon shelter to the Ching Tao House, a new residential block on land, of Chueng Ching Estate. The land inhabitants were put together into several designated areas so as to re-build their villages. The primary sectors had all died out owing to the drastic town development. Tsing Yi Estate, Cheung On Estate, Cheung Fat Estate, Ching Tai Court and Tsing Yi Garden were built after all reclamations were accomplished. Ching Wah Court was built adjoining to Cheung Hong Estate. At the same time, Tsing Yi Bridge was seriously overburdened and its structure was unable to cope with increasing traffic. There was only a one-way road in each direction on the bridge. Traffic congestion became the burning problem in the community, and subsequently fueled protest. Finally, Tsing Yi North Bridge, a connection to Tsuen Wan town was built to ease off the congestion, as well as to accommodate the local residential population boom.

Tsing Yi was continually under further development and Greenfield Garden, Serene Garden, Broadview Garden, and Cheung Hang Estate were constructed.

The final decision to relocate Hong Kong International Airport spurred a new series of development: Airport Railway, Ting Kau Bridge to Ting Kau and North New Territories, Tsing Ma Bridge to Ma Wan and Lantau Island, Rambler Channel Bridge to Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, Duplicate Tsing Yi South Bridge on the south side of Tsing Yi Bridge. On the island, new residential projects, Tivoli Garden, Grand Horizon, Mount Haven, Villa Esplanada, Tierra Verde, and Cheung Wang Estate were completed. The final part of reclaimed land near the shore had been laid waste for almost a decade until Tsing Yi Promenade was built in 2004. Local Hong Kong cultural pursuits of Chinese music and dancing, walking and Chinese exercise are in evidence in most evenings.

From 2000 to 2004, Container Terminal 9 was built on the reclaimed southwest shore of the island, together with resident blocks, Rambler Crest. Nearby, and well within sight of Central. Victoria, a controversial new dioxin burning plant was also put into operation during 2004, arousing much concern for the residents of Tsing Yi and Hong Kong island.

==Local product==

===Pier===
Before the completion of Tsing Yi Bridge, ferry was the only public transport to mainland Hong Kong. Tsing Yi Pier was built near Tsing Yi Town before the reclamation. The pier followed the change of shoreline owing after reclamation, and moved to the waterfront near Greenfield Garden.

Hovercraft service between Tsuen Wan, Tsing Yi and Central was provided by the former Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry. After the franchise of the company came to an end, Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry took over the route and operated it.

All ferry services ceased with rapid development of road and rail transport, especially MTR Tung Chung line with its station just a few hundred metres away from the ferry pier. It no longer takes residents to Tsuen Wan and Central. The pier is now open to the public, and continues to be used as a drop-off point for fishermen and tourists, and as a mooring site for government boats.

==Education==
In the early days, education on the Tsing Yi Island was mostly private. The first public school on the island is Tsing Yi Public School, a primary school founded by villagers and businessmen on the island. In the post-World War II era, Hong Kong Government provides 9-year free education to all children from primary one to secondary three. The public school is then mainly funded by the government. Another school for the children of fishermen, Tsing Yi Fishermen&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Primary School, was founded by Fish Marketing Organisation. In 1977, Cheung Ching Estate, the first public housing estates on the island, marked the beginning of the new town on the island. To accommodate new schooling children, three primary schools and Buddhist Yip Kei Nam Memorial College, the first secondary school on the island, were built with the estate. More schools were erected when new estates were completed. In 1999, a post-secondary college, Hong Kong Technical College (Tsing Yi), was completed and provides vocational training for all adults in Hong Kong. In the 2000s, the number of schooling children began to drop and the several schools are facing the fatal fate.

All of Tsing Yi is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 66. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money); no government schools are in this net.

<text>The Lac de Serre-Ponçon (; Vivaro-Alpine: &quot;Lac de Sèrra Ponçon&quot;), known in English as the Lake of Serre-Ponçon, is a reservoir on the border between the Hautes-Alpes and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence departments, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region, Southeastern France, one of the largest in Western Europe. The lake gathers the waters of the Durance and the Ubaye rivers, flowing down through the Hautes-Alpes and the Alpes du Sud to the Rhône. The waters are dammed by the , a high earth core dam.

As well as water control, sixteen hydroelectric plants use the water, with additional water control supporting; the lake provides irrigation to of land.

==History==

The lake was created to control water flow after disastrous floods caused severe damage and loss of life in 1843 and 1856. First proposed in 1895, construction started in 1955 and was completed by 1961.

During construction of the lake, approximately of material was moved. The dam was constructed and the valley slowly became a lake, flooding some villages in the process. This flooding is the subject of Jean Giono&#x27;s movie &quot;Girl and the River&quot; (1958), starring Guy Béart.

According to the official website of the Muséoscope, the &quot;museum of the largest dam in Europe made of compacted soil&quot;, Lac de Serre-Ponçon includes a hydroelectric power plant with a 380 MW generator. In addition to the power plant on the lake itself, the dam provides the reservoir and overall water management to facilitate an additional 15 hydroelectric plants along the Durance and Verdon rivers in Southeastern France, with total capacity of 2,000 MW.

The dam&#x27;s effects go beyond only the lake itself. It serves as a focal point that supports the functioning of a vast hydroelectric infrastructure network. In Southeast France, this network consists of 15 hydroelectric facilities that are carefully placed along the Durance and Verdon rivers. The combined capacity of these linked plants, which totals 2,000 MW, makes a substantial contribution to sustainable power generation and the region&#x27;s energy landscape.

Within the lake is a small chapel, Chapelle Saint-Michel, which was originally built on a hill in the 12th century, destroyed by the army of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy in 1692, and rebuilt soon after. The chapel was originally condemned during the construction of the dam and lake, but survived, its hill becoming an island in the lake. The island is accessible on foot during winter and early spring as the lake is emptier at this period

<text>Porkkalanniemi (), often referred to simply as Porkkala (), is a peninsula in the Gulf of Finland, located at Kirkkonummi (Kyrkslätt) in Southern Finland.

The peninsula had great strategic value, as coastal artillery based there would be able to shoot more than halfway across the Gulf of Finland. If the same power controlled the Estonian coast, on the opposite side of the gulf, it would then be able to block Saint Petersburg&#x27;s naval access to the Baltic Sea. The distance to Estonia at the closest point is only . Porkkala is furthermore located only from Helsinki, the Finnish capital, and a foreign power based there would be able to exert significant pressure on the Finnish government.

Nowadays, the coasts of the peninsula are popular birdwatching areas during the spring migrations of Arctic geese and other waterfowl.

== History ==

At the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union secured the rights of lease to a naval base at Porkkala, in accordance with the Moscow armistice agreement that ended the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviets on 19 September 1944.

Porkkala thus replaced the peninsula of Hanko, which had been leased to the Soviets as a naval base in 1940–41. A large area centered on the peninsula, including land from the municipalities of Kirkkonummi, Siuntio and Ingå and almost the entire area of Degerby, was leased to the USSR from 29 September 1944, ten days after the armistice. At the time of the Soviet take-over of the area, there were about 7200 Finnish inhabitants and all were evacuated during ten days in September 1944.

Beyond its military use, the naval base served to apply political pressure on the Finnish governments and also to help build a Soviet espionage network.

It was immediately placed under a military commander, Neon Antonov (1907–1948), who remained in office until June 1945, when he was transferred to command the Amur River flotilla, in preparation for the war against Japan.

According to the armistice of 1944, the area was leased to the Soviet Union for 50 years. On 10 February 1947, the Paris Peace Treaty reaffirmed the Soviet Union&#x27;s right to occupy the area until 1994.

No Soviet civilian administration was set up; the Soviet Union simply administered it through the military commander of Porkkala, a post held until 26 January 1956 by Sergey Kabanov (1901–1973), the former Commander of Hanko naval base.

At the height of the naval base operations, about 30,000 Soviet troops were stationed in the area along with some 10,000 Soviet officials and civilians such as members of officers&#x27; families.

While under Soviet control, Finnish passenger trains running between Helsinki and Turku were in 1947 allowed to use the railway through the area under payment of fees. However, all train windows had to be closed with shutters, and photography was prohibited during the 40 km (25 mile) transition.
During the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Soviet Olympic team was housed on the base, rather than in the Olympic village.

Although the Soviet lease for Porkkala had been conceded for 50 years, an agreement was reached to return it earlier. The agreement was signed on 19 September 1955, exactly 11 years after the armistice, and control of the area reverted to Finland on 26 January 1956. This may be attributed to the process of Finlandization and to technological progress making coastal artillery obsolete. The renunciation of Stalinism by the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev and Finland&#x27;s neutrality and remaining out of NATO were also important contributing factors.

Upon re-entering the area, the Finns found that the Soviets had destroyed about 50% of civilian housing and 80% of commercial properties which had been handed over in 1944. New constructions included a deep port in Båtvik and an airfield in Friggesby. The airfield was immediately demolished and returned to farmland and the majority of the evacuated population returned to their former homes. By the end of the 1960s, most traces of the Soviet tenure had been erased.

Currently, the Porkkala area houses one of the main bases of the Finnish Navy, located in Upinniemi, near Porkkala proper.

== In popular culture ==
The Soviet lease of Porkkala and the return of the area to former inhabitants are key events in the Finnish Noir mystery, &quot;Below the Surface&quot; by Leena Lehtolainen. The naval base also forms part of the plot line of the TV series &quot;&quot; (&quot;Nyrkki&quot;).

<text>The lev (, plural: / , ; ISO 4217 code: BGN; numeric code: 975) is the currency of Bulgaria. In old Bulgarian, the word &quot;lev&quot; meant &quot;lion&quot;; the word &quot;lion&quot; in the modern language is &quot;lаv&quot; (; in Bulgarian: ). The lev is divided in 100 &quot;stotinki&quot; (, singular: , ). &quot;Stotinka&quot; in Bulgarian means &quot;a hundredth&quot; and in fact is a transliteration of the French term &quot;centime.&quot; Grammatically, the word &quot;stotinka&quot; comes from the word &quot;sto&quot; (сто; a hundred).

Since 1997, the lev has been in a currency board arrangement with initially the Deutsche Mark at a fixed rate of BGL 1000 to DEM 1. After the introduction of the euro and the redenomination of the lev in 1999, this has resulted in a fixed rate to the euro of BGN 1.95583 : EUR 1. Since 2020, the lev has been a part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II). When all the conditions have been met, Bulgaria should join the Eurozone as soon as the price stability criteria have been met. In November 2023, Bulgarian euro coin designs were revealed and approved by the Bulgarian National Bank.

The currency&#x27;s name comes from the archaic Bulgarian word &quot;lev,&quot; which meant &quot;lion&quot;.

The lion has been the national symbol of Bulgaria over the centuries. Lions were common in the region until about 300 BC. In Bulgaria, the lion features in numerous historical monuments. The oldest images, found on slates in the city of Stara Zagora, date back to the 9th–10th century AD. A lion is depicted on The Madara Horseman – an impressive medieval rock relief carved into a towering rock plateau in northeastern Bulgaria in the 7th or 8th century AD, which is on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List. In the Middle Ages, Bulgarian kings such as Ivan Shishman, one of the last rulers of the Second Bulgarian kingdom, celebrated the lion as a symbol of power.

In the time of Bulgarian national awakening in the years of Ottoman bondage, the lion was considered and widely used as a major national symbol. Paisii of Hilendar, a discerning monastic and a key Revival figure, mentioned in his ground-breaking tome that Bulgarians had a lion on their kings&#x27; royal seal: a symbol of the bravery, courage and invincibility of Bulgarian warriors, who fought &quot;like lions.&quot;

Lion images on revolutionary flags, used in the 1876 freedom-seeking April uprising, provide a proof that the lion continued to be considered as a national symbol. In the immediate period leading up to the revolt, revolutionary flags were made, featuring a golden lion rampant and the motto &quot;Freedom or Death.&quot; These flags, most often hand-made by local teachers or icon painters, have been preserved in Bulgarian museums to the present day. Most flags were made of green silk and had a painted or embroidered lion on them, in a heraldic posture and trampling over the Crescent – the symbol of the Ottoman Empire. The same image can be seen on items of one-time rebel outfits such as hats and buttons. In Bulgarian folklore and Revival Literature, these lion depictions were called lion signs attributed to the Bulgarian revolutionaries&#x27; image. &quot;Young Bulgarian heroes...lion signs on their foreheads, fire blazing in their eyes,&quot; says a most popular Bulgarian Revival period song.

== History ==
===First lev (1881–1952)===
The lev was introduced as Bulgaria&#x27;s currency in 1881 with a value equal to the French franc. The gold standard was suspended between 1899 and 1906 and suspended again in 1912. Until 1916, Bulgaria&#x27;s silver and gold coins were issued to the same specifications as those of the Latin Monetary Union. Banknotes issued until 1928 were backed by gold (&quot;leva zlato&quot; / &quot;zlatni&quot;, лева злато / златни) or silver (&quot;leva srebro&quot; / &quot;srebarni&quot;, лева сребро / сребърни).

In 1928, a new gold standard of 1 lev = 10.86956 mg gold was established.

During World War II, in 1940, the lev was pegged to the German Reichsmark at a rate of 32.75 leva = 1 Reichsmark. With the Soviet occupation in September 1944, the lev was pegged to the Soviet ruble at 15 leva = 1 ruble. A series of pegs to the U.S. dollar followed: 120 leva = 1 dollar in October 1945, 286.50 leva in December 1945 and 143.25 leva in March 1947. No coins were issued after 1943; only banknotes were issued until the currency reform of 1952.

====Coins====

Between 1881 and 1884, bronze 2, 5, and 20 stotinki, and silver 50 stotinki, 1, 2, and 5 leva were introduced, followed, in 1888, by cupro-nickel , 5, 10, and 20 stotinki. Gold 10 and 20 leva were issued in 1894. Bronze 1 stotinka were introduced in 1901.

Production of silver coins ceased in 1916, with zinc replacing cupro-nickel in the 5, 10, and 20 stotinki in 1917. In 1923, aluminum 1 and 2 leva coins were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel pieces in 1925. In 1930, cupro-nickel 5 and 10 leva and silver 20, 50, and 100 leva were introduced, with silver coins issued until 1937, in which year aluminium-bronze 50 stotinki were issued.

In 1940, cupro-nickel 20 and 50 leva were issued, followed, in 1941, by iron 1, 2, 5, and 10 leva. In 1943, nickel-clad-steel 5, 10 and 50 leva were struck. These were the last coins issued for this version of the lev.

====Banknotes====

In 1885, the Bulgarian National Bank introduced notes for 20 and 50 gold leva, followed in 1887 by 100 gold leva and, in 1890, by 5 and 10 gold leva notes. In 1899, 5, 10 and 50 silver leva notes were issued, followed by 100 and 500 silver leva in 1906 and 1907, respectively. 500 gold leva notes were also introduced in 1907.

In 1916, 1 and 2 silver leva and 1000 gold leva notes were introduced, followed by 2500 and 10,000 gold leva notes in 1919. In 1924, 5000 leva notes were issued, the first to lack a metal designation. In 1928, a new series of notes (dated 1922 and 1925) was introduced which gave the denominations solely in leva. Denominations introduced were 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 leva. These were followed in 1929 by 200 and 250 leva.

In 1930, coins up to 100 leva replaced notes, although 20-lev notes were issued between 1943 and 1950. Between 1943 and 1945, State Treasury Bills for 1000 and 5000 leva were issued.

===Second lev (1952–1962)===
In 1952, following wartime inflation, a new lev replaced the original lev at a rate of 1 &quot;new&quot; lev = 100 &quot;old&quot; leva. However the rate for banking accounts was different, ranging from 100:3 to 200:1. Prices for goods were replaced at a rate of 25:1. The new lev was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 6.8 leva = 1 dollar, falling to 9.52 leva on July 29, 1957.

====Coins====
In 1952, coins (dated 1951) were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 25 stotinki, with the lower three denominations in brass and the higher three in cupro-nickel. Shortly after, cupro-nickel 20 stotinki coins dated 1952 were also issued, followed by 50 stotinki in 1959 and 1 lev in 1960 which replaced the 1 lev note (both also in cupro-nickel). All stotinki coins feature a head of wheat around denomination on the reverse and state emblem on the obverse, while the lev coin depicts an olive branch wreath around the denomination.

====Banknotes====
In 1952, state notes (dated 1951) were issued in 1, 3 and 5 leva, together with notes of the National Bank for 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 leva. 500-lev notes were printed but not issued. 1 lev notes were withdrawn after the introduction of a coin in 1960. 1, 3, and 5 leva depict the state emblem, while all denominations 10 leva and up depict Georgi Dimitrov, who had a postmortem cult of personality built up around him by that time period. The reverse side of 1 lev, 3 and 5 leva notes depict hands holding up the hammer and sickle, while higher denominations each depict workers at various trades.

===Third lev (1962–1999)===

In 1962, another redenomination took place at the rate of 10 to 1, setting the exchange rate at 1.17 leva = 1 U. S. dollar, with the tourist rate falling to 2 leva on February 1, 1964. The ISO 4217 code was . After this, the lev remained fairly stable for almost three decades. However, like other Communist countries&#x27; currencies, it was not freely convertible for Western funds. Consequently, black market rates were five to ten times higher than the official rate. During the period, until 1989 the lev was backed by gold, and the banknotes have the text stating: &quot;The bank note is backed by gold and all assets of the bank&quot; ().

After the fall of communism, Bulgaria experienced several episodes of drastic inflation and currency devaluation. In order to change this, in 1997, the lev was pegged to the Deutsche Mark, with 1,000 lev equal to 1 DM (one lev equal to 0.1 pfennig).

Since 1997, Bulgaria has been in a system of currency board, and all Bulgarian currency in circulation has been completely backed by the foreign exchange reserves of the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB).

====Coins====

In 1962, aluminum-bronze 1, 2, and 5 stotinki, and nickel-brass 10, 20 and 50 stotinki and 1 lev were introduced. The coin series strongly resembles coinage from the Soviet Union during the same period, particularly in design and size.

The state emblem is depicted on the obverse of all coins, which went through several changes. The first change in 1962 with the introduction of the new coinage, and the second change in 1974, with the ribbons being the most noticeable change.

A number of commemorative 2 leva coins also circulated during this period, often released into circulation as they had relatively high production numbers and little collector&#x27;s value. Higher denomination lev coins have also been introduced into circulation at an irregular basis with varying sizes and metallic compositions, including silver. Mostly due to an overstock of numismatic coins not getting sold to collectors. Similar occurrences to this can be seen with high denomination coins from East Germany and Poland during the same period.

=====Post-communist coins=====

In 1992, after the communist era, older coins were withdrawn and a new coinage was introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 stotinki, 1, 2, 5 and 10 leva. All were struck in nickel-brass except for the cupro-nickel 10 leva. In 1997, nickel-brass 10, 20 and 50 leva were introduced.

====Banknotes====
In 1962, the National Bank issued notes for 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 leva. A second series, in the same denominations, was issued in 1974. 50 leva notes were introduced in 1990. Again, denominations 10 leva and up featured Georgi Dimitrov, 1, 2, and 5 featured the state emblem. After the fall of the communist regime, new notes were introduced for 20, 50, 100 and 200 leva. These were followed by 500 leva notes in 1993, 1000 and 2000 leva in 1994, 5000 and 10,000 leva in 1996 (re-released with new design and look in 1997), and 50,000 leva in 1997. Furthermore, two new banknotes of 20,000 and 100,000 leva were scheduled to be introduced in 1997 and 1998, but their production was canceled following the introduction of currency board in 1997.

===Fourth lev (1999–present)===
On 5 July 1999 the lev was redenominated at 1000:1 with 1 new lev equal to 1 Deutsche Mark. The ISO 4217 currency code for the new Bulgarian lev is BGN. The lev is pegged at €1 = 1.95583 leva (previously DEM 1 = BGN 1, continuing the fixed exchange rate from the third lev).

====Euro adoption====

Since Bulgaria gained EU membership in 2007 various dates have been suggested as the expected end of the lev: towards the end of that year 1 January 2012 was a possible date; however, the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Eurozone crisis reduced the initial enthusiasm for the euro. Nevertheless, in 2009 &quot;The Economist&quot; noted suggestions to accelerate Bulgaria&#x27;s path to the euro, or even let it be adopted immediately, despite the EU institutions&#x27; unwillingness to deviate from a policy of euro adoption only after five Euro convergence criteria have been met. In 2011 the Bulgarian finance minister Simeon Djankov acknowledged his earlier eagerness for Bulgaria to join the euro, but considered 2015 as a more likely date. If Bulgaria follows the standard path to euro adoption, it would use the euro two years after joining the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) (a formality given the lev&#x27;s peg to the euro). In late 2010, given Bulgaria&#x27;s improving economy, analysts thought that Bulgaria would join the ERM II the following year. However, the continued postponement of joining the mechanism has prevented Bulgaria meeting all five convergence criteria: its rebounding economy later met the four other criteria.

On 10 July 2020, along with Croatia, Bulgaria joined the ERM II, which allows it to adopt the euro no earlier than two years after joining assuming the other convergence criteria are met.

====Coins====
In 1999, coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 stotinki were introduced. A 1 lev coin replaced the 1 lev banknote in 2002, and a 2 lev coin the 2 lev banknote in 2015.

=====Commemorative coins=====
In 2004, 2005, and 2007, commemorative circulation issues were struck of the 50 stotinkas coin. In 2018, a commemorative circulation issue of the 2 leva coin was issued. These coins are not found in general circulation.

Many commercial commemorative coins have also been minted.

====Banknotes====
In 1999, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 leva. 100 leva notes were added in 2003. The 1 and 2 lev notes were later replaced by coins of similar value and withdrawn from circulation.

====Exchange rates====
The fourth lev was pegged to the German mark at par from the start. With the replacement of the Deutsche Mark by the euro, the lev&#x27;s peg effectively switched to the euro at the rate of 1.95583 leva = 1 euro (precisely equivalent to the German mark&#x27;s fixed exchange rate to euro). This rate is unlikely to change before the lev&#x27;s eventual retirement.

<text>The University of Hong Kong (HKU) () is a public research university in Pokfulam, Hong Kong. It was founded in 1887 as the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese by the London Missionary Society and formally established as the University of Hong Kong in 1911. It is the oldest tertiary institution in Hong Kong.

The university was established and proposed by Governor Sir Frederick Lugard in an effort to compete with the other Great Powers opening universities in China. The university&#x27;s governance consists of three bodies: the Court, the Council, and the Senate. These three bodies all have their own separate roles. The Court acts as the overseeing and legislative body of the university, the Council acts as governing body of the University, and the Senate as the principal academic authority of the university.

The university currently has ten academic faculties and 20 residential halls and colleges for its students, with English being its main medium of instruction and assessment.

The university has educated many notable alumni in many fields. Among them is Dr Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, a graduate of the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, the predecessor of HKU. Notable alumni in the field of politics include Anson Chan, Carrie Lam, Jasper Tsang and Regina Ip.

The university is currently ranked 35th in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

==History==

===Founding===
The origins of the University of Hong Kong can be traced back to the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, founded in 1887 by Ho Kai (later known as Sir Kai Ho Kai). It was renamed the Hong Kong College of Medicine in 1907. The college was later incorporated as HKU&#x27;s medical school in 1911.

The University of Hong Kong was founded in 1911. The colony&#x27;s governor, Sir Frederick Lugard, first proposed in January 1908 during a graduation ceremony at St Stephen&#x27;s College to establish a university in Hong Kong to compete with the other Great Powers opening universities in China, most notably Prussia, which had just opened the Tongji German Medical School in Shanghai. Sir Lugard saw the establishment of the university as an opportunity to promote British culture to China and the Chinese people through education, in turn enhancing Britain&#x27;s influence in the Far East. He quoted saying, &quot;
We must either now take those opportunities or leave them for others to take...&quot;. Sir Hormusjee Naorojee Mody, an Indian Parsi businessman in Hong Kong, learned of Lugard&#x27;s plan and pledged to donate towards the construction and towards other costs. The Hong Kong Government and the business sector in southern China, which were both equally eager to learn &quot;secrets of the West&#x27;s success&quot; (referring to technological advances made since the Industrial Revolution), also gave their support. The Government contributed a site at West Point. Swire Group contributed to endow a chair in Engineering, in addition to thousands of dollars in equipment (its aim was partly to bolster its corporate image following the death of a passenger on board one of its ships, &quot;SS Fatshan&quot;, and the subsequent unrest stirred by the Self-Government Society). Along with donations from other donors including the British government and companies such as HSBC, Lugard finally had enough to fund the building of the university.

Charles Eliot was appointed the university&#x27;s first vice-chancellor. As Governor of Hong Kong, Lugard laid the foundation stone of the Main Building on 16 March 1910. The university was incorporated in Hong Kong as a self-governing body of scholars on 30 March 1911 and had its official opening ceremony on 11 March 1912. It was founded as an all-male institution; women were admitted for the first time ten years later.

The school opened with three founding faculties: Arts, Engineering, and Medicine. The Faculty of Medicine was previously founded as the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese by the London Missionary Society in 1887. Of the College&#x27;s early alumni, the most renowned was Sun Yat-sen, who led the Chinese Revolution of 1911, which transformed China from an empire (Qing dynasty) to a republic (Republic of China). In December 1916, the university held its first convocation, with 23 graduates and five honorary graduates.

===Move towards Chinese cultural education, and WW2===

After the Canton–Hong Kong strikes of 1925 and 1926, the government moved towards greater integration of Eastern culture, increasing the number of Chinese courses. In 1927, a degree in Chinese was created. Donations from wealthy businessmen Tang Chi Ngong and Fung Ping Shan – after whom two campus buildings are named – triggered an emphasis on Chinese cultural education. In 1937, the Queen Mary Hospital opened. It has served as the university&#x27;s teaching hospital ever since. In 1941, the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong caused damage to university buildings, and the university closed until 1945; during this period, the university&#x27;s medical school moved to Chengdu.

===1945 to 2001===
After the end of the Second World War, the university reopened and investment in law and the social sciences increased as post-war reconstruction efforts began in earnest. The Faculty of Social Sciences was established in 1967 and the Department of Law in 1969. The student population in 1961 was 2,000, quadrupled from 1941, and in 1980 the number of students exceeded 5,500.

In 1958, the librarian of University of Hong Kong, Mrs. Dorothea Scott, organized a meeting of over 40 library practitioners at the Fung Ping Shan Library on 3 April to determine and establish a library association for Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Library Association.

In 1982, the Faculty of Dentistry, based at the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, was established. To this day, it remains Hong Kong&#x27;s only faculty training dental professionals. In 1984, both the School of Architecture and School of Education became fully-fledged faculties and in the same year the Faculty of Law was created. The Faculty of Business and Economics was established in 2001 as the university&#x27;s tenth and youngest faculty.

After 1989, the Hong Kong government began to emphasise local tertiary education in order to retain local students who would otherwise have studied abroad in the United Kingdom. Student places and course variety were greatly increased in preparation for the handover of Hong Kong. By 2001, the number of students had grown to 14,300 and the number of degree courses to over a hundred.

===2001 to present===

In 2002, &quot;Growing with Hong Kong: The University and Its Graduates — The First 90 Years&quot; was published by the Hong Kong University Press as a study of the impact of HKU&#x27;s graduates on Hong Kong.

In January 2006, despite protest from a portion of students and alumni, the Faculty of Medicine was renamed as the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine
&quot;to recognize the generosity of Mr Li and his Foundation as well as the wish of the donors to support, in addition to the general development of the University, research and academic activities in medicine.&quot;

On 16 August 2011, Li Keqiang, Vice Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, began a three-day visit to promote development between Hong Kong and mainland China. The university was locked down. The mishandling by the police force caused the Hong Kong 818 incident. In a statement to the HKU community, the university vice-chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui admitted that the security arrangements could have been better planned and organised, and apologised to students and alumni for not having been able to prevent the incident. He assured them that &quot;the University campus belongs to students and teachers, and that it will always remain a place for freedom of expression&quot;. On 30 August 2011, the university council resolved to set up a panel to review issues arising from the vice premier&#x27;s visit, to improve arrangements and to set up policies for future university events that are consistent with its commitment to freedom of expression.

From 2010 to 2012, the university celebrated its 100th anniversary and the opening of the Centennial Campus at the western end of the university site in Pokfulam. The University of Hong Kong–Shenzhen Hospital, one of the two teaching hospitals of the university, also opened in 2011.

On 10 April 2015, HKU declared itself as the first university in the world to join HeForShe, a UN Women initiative urging men to achieve more female rights. The university promised that it would triple the number of female dean-level members by 2020, so that more than 1 out of every 5 deans would be women.

On 15 December 2017, the university&#x27;s governing council appointed University of California, Berkeley nanoscience professor Xiang Zhang to the posts of President and Vice-Chancellor with effect from January 2018. Zhang was the first vice-chancellor of the university born in mainland China and educated to undergraduate degree level there.

On 4 September 2023, the university announced the appointment of Professor Sir Fraser Stoddart, a distinguished chemist and Nobel Laureate, as a Chair Professor. Stoddart has been a Board of Trustees Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University, IL, USA for the past 16 years. Stoddart&#x27;s ground-breaking research has garnered numerous accolades and awards, including the prestigious 2007 King Faisal International Prize in Science. In 2016, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Bernard L. Feringa and Jean-Pierre Sauvage for their work on the design and synthesis of molecular machines. HKU was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; to report the passing of Stoddart on 31 December 2024, at the age of 82.

====2015 political interference====
The HKU Council made headlines in 2015 for alleged political interference behind the selection process for a new pro-vice chancellor. A selection committee unanimously recommended the council appoint Johannes Chan to the post, which involved the responsibility for staffing and resources, and which had been left vacant for five years. Chan, the former dean of the Faculty of Law, was a distinguished scholar in constitutional law and human rights and &quot;a vocal critic on Hong Kong&#x27;s political reform issues&quot;. Owing to his liberal political stance, Chan was roundly criticised by Communist Party-controlled media including &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot;, &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;, and &quot;Global Times&quot;, which together published at least 350 articles attacking him.

Customarily the HKU Council accepts the recommendations of search committees for senior posts, with no prior recommendation having been rejected by the council. The council was criticised when it delayed the decision to appoint Chan, stating that it should wait until a new provost was in place. Finally, in September 2015, the council rejected Chan&#x27;s appointment (12 votes to eight) through an anonymous vote in a closed meeting, providing no reason for the decision. Political interference was widely suspected and the opacity of the council criticised.

The decision is seen widely viewed as a pro-government act of retaliation against &quot;pro-democracy leaders and participants&quot; and a blow to academic freedom. Six members of the council are directly appointed by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, who acts as chancellor of all publicly funded tertiary institutions in the territory. Five members are delegates to the National People&#x27;s Congress in Beijing and, as such, are obliged to toe the Communist Party line or risk expulsion. In overall Council makeup, university students and staff are outnumbered by members from outside the university.

The decision was decried by student groups including the Hong Kong University Students&#x27; Union and Hong Kong Federation of Students, faculty members, leading international law scholars, and legislators. They noted that the decision would serve as a warning to other academics not to engage in pro-democratic politics and would severely tarnish Hong Kong&#x27;s reputation for academic freedom and education excellence. The law faculty also refuted the allegations against Chan. Billy Fung, student union president, revealed details of the discussion to the public and was subsequently expelled from the council.

==Campuses==


The university&#x27;s main campus covers of land on Pokfulam Road and Bonham Road in Pokfulam of Central and Western District, Hong Kong Island. The university also has a few buildings in Sandy Bay Gap. Buildings of the university are some of the few remaining examples of British Colonial architecture in Hong Kong. The university lends its name to HKU MTR station, the main public transport access to the campus which had opened on 28 December 2014.

The Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine is situated 4.5 km southwest of the main campus, in the Southern District near Sandy Bay and Pokfulam. The medical campus includes Queen Mary Hospital, the William M.W. Mong Building and research facilities. The Faculty of Dentistry is situated in the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, Sai Ying Pun.

The university also operates the Kadoorie Agricultural Research Centre, which occupies of land in the New Territories, and the Swire Institute of Marine Science at the southern tip of the d&#x27;Aguilar Peninsula on Hong Kong Island.

===Main building===

Constructed between 1910 and 1912, the Main Building is the university&#x27;s oldest structure and was sponsored by Sir Hormusjee Naorojee Mody and designed by Architect Messrs Leigh &amp; Orange. It is built in the post-renaissance Edwardian Baroque style with red brick and granite and has two courtyards. The main elevation is articulated by four turrets with a central clock tower (a gift from Sir Paul Chater in 1930). The two courtyards were added in the south in 1952 and one floor in the end block in 1958. The building was originally used as classrooms and laboratories for the Faculty of Medicine and Engineering and was later the home of departments within the Faculty of Arts. The central Great Hall (Loke Yew Hall) is named after Loke Yew, a Malayan benefactor of the university in its early years. It became a declared monument in 1984.

===Swire building===
Around 1980, the Swire Group sponsored the building of a new residential hall in the eastern end of the campus. The new student residence was named Swire Building in honour of this sponsorship. The building was officially opened by Mr John Anthony Swire on 11 November 1980. In 1983, the colour orange was chosen to be the hall colour in the second Annual General Meeting since the colour was used as the background colour during the first open day of Swire Hall and no other halls were using orange as their hall colour.

In 1983, Mrs J. Lau (Director of Centre Media Resources) provided a design for the hall logo. The Swire Hall Students&#x27; Association, HKUSU, then made some amendments to that design. The logo shows the words &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;H&#x27;. The design of the word &#x27;S&#x27; looks like two hands holding each other, signifying that all hall-mates should co-operate with each other, and promoting the hall motto &#x27;Unity and Sincerity&#x27;.

===Hung Hing Ying Building===

Financed by Sir Paul Chater, Professor G. P. Jordan and others, it was opened in 1919 by the Governor of Hong Kong Sir Reginald Stubbs and housed the students&#x27; union. After World War II, the building was used temporarily for administrative purposes. The East Wing was added in 1960. The building was converted into the Senior Common Room in 1974. It was named in honour of Mr Hung Hing-Ying in 1986 for his family&#x27;s donations to the university. The building was subsequently used again for administrative purposes, and housed Department of Music and the Music Library until early 2013. It is currently used by the Development &amp; Alumni Affairs Office. The two-storey Edwardian style structure is characterised by a central dome and the use of red brick to emulate the Main Building opposite. The building became a declared monument in 1995.

===Tang Chi Ngong Building===

The idea to establish a school of Chinese was proposed in the inter-war period. Construction of the premises began in 1929 following a donation from Tang Chi-ngong, father of the philanthropist Sir Tang Shiu-kin, after whom the building was named. It was opened by Sir William Peel, Governor of Hong Kong, in 1931 and since then further donations have been received for the endowment of teaching Chinese language and literature. The building has been used for other purposes since the 1970s but the name remained unchanged. It housed the Centre of Asian Studies until 2012 and now houses the Jao Tsung-I Petite Ecole. This three-storey flat-roofed structure is surfaced with Shanghai plaster and became a declared monument in 1995.

===Centennial campus===

To provide additional space for students under the new four-year undergraduate curriculum the Centennial Campus was built at the western end of the main campus, which was previously occupied by the Water Supplies Department. The construction of the campus started in late 2009, and was completed in 2012, the first year of the introduction of the new academic structure in Hong Kong. In 2012, the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Social Sciences moved to the Centennial Campus.

==Academics==

===Admission===
Admission to HKU is highly competitive. In 2016, the university received around 40,000 applications for undergraduate studies, over 16,000 of which were from outside the Hong Kong schools&#x27; system. For Mainland China applicants, the enrollment rate was 1 student for every 21 applications. According to a survey done by the &quot;Education18.com&quot; (The Hong Kong Education Net), HKU enrolled students with the best performance in HKDSE examination in 2012. Internationally, applicants with more than 5 A*s in their GCE A-Levels, 75/75 in the Taiwan GSAT, 45/45 in IB, and 16 5** Zhuangyuan () (the top Gaokao scoring students in their province or city in mainland China) are amongst those matriculated into the University. The latest International Admissions Profile, with information and data about last year&#x27;s admissions and current global exchange opportunities for those admitted, is available on the HKU website.

Undergraduate candidates are selected according to their relative merit in the local public examination (HKDSE) and apply online via JUPAS. Other applicants, including overseas students or ones taking other examinations, are classified as non-JUPAS applicants who are required to apply via the official website, where postgraduate applications may also be made.

===Teaching and learning===
Most undergraduate courses are 4-year degrees while the medical and nursing programmes require two and one more year(s) of studies respectively. English is the main medium of instruction, and the University&#x27;s Senate has endorsed English as the campus lingua franca. Starting from 2012, local students are required to take Academic English courses and Chinese language enhancement courses; however, students who are native-speakers of languages other than Chinese, and students who have not studied Chinese language in their secondary curriculum can be exempted from the Chinese course requirement. Cantonese credit-courses for Mainland Chinese and Taiwan students, and &quot;ab initio&quot; Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese credit-courses for international and exchange students are offered by the Chinese Language Centre, School of Chinese.

===Research===
The university is a founding member of Universitas 21, an international consortium of research-led universities, and a member of the Association for Pacific Rim Universities, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, Washington University in St. Louis&#x27;s McDonnell International Scholars Academy, and many others. HKU benefits from a large operating budget supplied by high levels of government funding compared to many Western countries. In 2018/19, the Research Grants Council (RGC) granted HKU a total research funding of HK$12,127 million (41.3% of overall RGC funding), which was the highest among all universities in Hong Kong. HKU professors were among the highest paid in the world as well, having salaries far exceeding those of their US counterparts in private universities. However, with the reduction of salaries in recent years, this is no longer the case.

HKU research output, researchers, projects, patents and theses are profiled and made publicly available in the HKU Scholars Hub. 100 members of academic staff (&gt;10% of professoriate staff) from HKU are ranked among the world&#x27;s top 1% of scientists by the Thomson Reuters&#x27; Essential Science Indicators, by means of the citations recorded on their publications. The university has the largest number of research postgraduate students in Hong Kong, making up approximately 10% of the total student population. All ten faculties and departments provide teaching and supervision for research (MPhil and PhD) students with administration undertaken by the Graduate School.

The University Grants Committee delivered the idea of “knowledge transfer” among the community and universities. From the academic year 2009/10, a yearly recurrent funding for universities to invest in knowledge transfer has been approved by the Legislative Council. Therefore, HKU has established the Knowledge Exchange Office in 2010.

===Libraries and museums===


HKU Libraries (HKUL) was established in 1912, being the oldest academic library in Hong Kong with over 2.3 million current holdings. It comprises the Main Library and six specialist branch libraries: the Dental, Education, Fung Ping Shan (East Asian Language), Yu Chun Keung Medical, Lui Che Woo Law, and Music libraries. They are located in buildings around the campus with varying opening hours. A web-based library catalogue, DRAGON, allows one to search HKUL&#x27;s books, journals and other resources.

The HKUL Digital Initiatives, through its digitisation projects, has opened up online access to local collections originally in print format. The first HKUL Digital Initiative, ExamBase, was launched in 1996 and other projects of scholarly interests were introduced. More digital projects are being developed to provide continuous access to digital content and services. It provides open access to Chinese and English academic and medical periodicals published in Hong Kong.

The three-storey Fung Ping Shan Building was erected in 1932 originally as a library for Chinese books. Named after its donor, the building consists of masonry on the ground level surmounted by a two-storey red-brick structure with ornamental columns topped by a pediment over its entrance. Since 1962, the Chinese books collection, now known as the Fung Ping Shan Library, was transferred to the university&#x27;s Main Library and the whole building was converted into a museum for Chinese art and archaeology. Among its collections are ceramics, pottery and bronze sculptures. In 1996, the lowest three floors of the new Tsui Building were added to the old building to form the University Museum and Art Gallery.

==Student life==
Student welfare is served by several units, including the Centre of Development and Resources for Students (CEDARS), which provides guidance for most areas of student life including career counselling, and the University Health Service, which provides health care, referrals, and preventive services.

===Demographics===
The student population of the university was 39,166 in the 2023-2024 academic year, comprising 18,491 undergraduates, 16,541 taught postgraduates and 4,134 research postgraduates. The university has become a popular choice for mainland and international students, with 19,145 non-local students (excluding exchange students) on campus in 2023, comprising 47.2% of the total students.

===Halls and colleges===
There are 20 residential halls and colleges for undergraduates, postgraduates and visitors.

The residential halls include:
* Main Campus – Swire Hall and Simon K. Y. Lee Hall, mainly for undergraduates. Graduate House and Robert Black College, primarily for postgraduates and visitors respectively.
* Sassoon Road Campus – Lee Hysan Hall, Richard Charles Lee Hall, Wei Lun Hall and Madam S. H. Ho Hall Residence for Medical Students.
* Jockey Club Student Village I (founded in 2001) – Lady Ho Tung Hall and Starr Hall.
* Jockey Club Student Village II (founded in 2005) – Morrison Hall, Lee Shau Kee Hall and Suen Chi Sun Hall.
* (founded in 2012) – made up of four residential colleges, Shun Hing College, Chi Sun College, Lap-Chee College and New College. They provide a total of 1,800 beds for students of whom 67% are non-local students.
* Jockey Club Student Village IV – made up of four residential colleges. They provide a total of 1,238 hostel places for students.
* Other historical student residences include St. John&#x27;s College, Ricci Hall and University Hall.

Moreover, there are three non-residential halls:
* Hornell Hall (male only)
* Lee Chi Hung Hall (co-educational)

===Student organisations===
Two officially recognised student body, formerly three, provides opportunities for postgraduate students to participate in extracurricular activities. The two being the Postgraduate Student Association (PGSA) and the HKU Business School Postgraduate Student Association (HKUBSPA). Undergraduate students participate in student societies registered with the university&#x27;s Co-Curricular Support Office (CCSO).

The Hong Kong University Students&#x27; Union (HKUSU) existed as an officially recognised student body, which represented both undergraduate and postgraduate students, with a majority of its members being undergraduate students. It was established in 1912. The union ceased to be officially recognised by the university after passing a motion in memorial to a deceased assailant who attacked and severely stabbed a police officer on the street during the heights of the protests in 2021, and was later dissolved. Prior to its dissolution, the HKUSU offered more than a hundred student societies for students. Student societies are now registered with the university&#x27;s CCSO.

This organisation was renowned amongst student activists, having been the main driving force behind evicting a vice-chancellor in recent years. There were controversies in 2011 when the President of the union, Ayo Chan, remarked that some of the protesters involved in the Tiananmen Square massacre had acted irrationally. Many students believe his remarks to be offensive and subsequently ousted the President by a vote in under one week.

===Study abroad programme===
Through the Exchange Buddy Program, students from abroad can choose to be matched with local students whom they can correspond with before they arrive in Hong Kong. These local students greet the visiting students upon arrival at the airport, help them to settle into student residence and offer advice and support during their stay.

Every year, over 1,000 undergraduates participate in exchange programmes. As part of their HKU degree, they study at universities spanning 40 countries around the world with the support of the University Grants Committee, University of Hong Kong Foundation for Educational Development and Research, Hongkong Bank Foundation, UBC Alumni Association (Hong Kong), Dr. Lee Shiu Scholarships for Hong Kong and South-East Asia Academic Exchange, Shell (Hong Kong) Limited, C. V. Starr Scholarship Fund, and others. The university welcomes a similar number of students from those 340 partner universities onto the HKU campus to study each year. HKU is also a member of the Laidlaw Scholars programme which provides funding for undergraduates to conduct research abroad, either independently or at another university in the network such as University College London and University of Leeds.

==Organisation and administration==

* Centennial College, a liberal arts college established in 2012. It has provided self-financed 4-year bachelor&#x27;s degree programmes for HKALE, HKDSE and other graduates from September 2012.

===Shield, motto and coat of arms===
The design of the university&#x27;s shield of arms was proposed to the College of Arms by the university in October 1912. On 14 May 1913, the shield, along with two mottoes (one in Latin, one in Chinese) was granted by the College of Arms. The field resembles the lions on the coat of arms of England, whereas the book on the shield is a common reference to university&#x27;s role in learning and knowledge. The official blazon and all authentic colour copies of the shield of arms were lost during the Sino-Japanese War, which the university obtained new ones from the College of Arms in 1958 while preparing for the Golden Jubillee set to happen 3 years later.

The Latin motto &quot;Sapientia et Virtus&quot; is translated into English as &quot;Wisdom and Virtue&quot;. The Chinese motto on the pages of the opened book, written from top to bottom, right to left in accordance with traditional Chinese writing direction, contains two phrases: 明德 (&quot;ming tak&quot;) and 格物 (&quot;kak mat&quot;), meaning &quot;illustrious virtue&quot; and &quot;the investigation of things&quot; respectively. The first phrase &quot;ming tak&quot; makes homage to the opening sentence of classic Confucian Classical Chinese literature the Great Learning, in which the author discusses the three great duties of a ruler: illustrious virtue, the renewal of the people, and repose in the highest good. The second phrase &quot;kak mat&quot; is a reference to the writing of Confucian scholar Zhu Xi 致知在格物 (lit. exhausting by examination the principles of things and affairs). The phrase occurs in discussion regarding how wise rulers set about cultivating wisdom and virtue. If one desires to rectify their heart, they must first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they must first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.

In 1981, the year of the university&#x27;s 70th anniversary, an application was made to the College of Arms for a full achievement of arms, which was granted in 1984, comprising the original shield and mottoes with the addition of a crest, supporters, a helmet and compartment. The supporters of the coat of arms are a Chinese dragon and a lion representing Britain, indicating the university&#x27;s aspiration to blend East and West cultures, from the foundation by British people in Hong Kong and the later development of the university&#x27;s research and studies in both west and east culture and technology, whereas the compartment is an allusion to Hong Kong Island, where the university is located. The university remains to this day the only university in Hong Kong to be granted a full coat of arms by the College of Arms. The other university in Hong Kong to have been granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms was The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1961; it is, however, not a full achievement of arms owing to a missing crest.

=== University Mace ===
The Mace is the symbol of the university&#x27;s authority. Made of silver gilt, the mace is 40 inches long and weighs about 300 ounces, with the two collars of the mace being set with amber-red and green jade stones. The drum bears the university’s shield of arms, which is enamelled in colour and encircled within a buckled belt displaying the motto. On both sides of the drum are full-length four-toed Chinese dragons. The original mace went missing during the Sino-Japanese War and was replaced.

A mace bearer is appointed by the vice-chancellor to bear the university&#x27;s mace. The current mace bearer is Dr Gordon Wong Tin Chun. The university&#x27;s mace is carried in university processions by the mace bearer, symbolising the university&#x27;s authority. The mace bearer will always precede the presiding officer in the procession for this reason.

===University anthem===

The recording of the reconstructed University Anthem was recorded by the Hong Kong Sinfonietta, the Diocesan Choral Society and the former HKU Students&#x27; Union Choir (now known as the HKU University Choir), conducted by the Sinfonietta&#x27;s musical director, Yip Wing-sie, with new orchestration by Dr Chan Hing-yan, Chairperson of the Department of Music.

==Controversies and incidents==

* In 2014, a huge container ship the Hansa Constitution crashed into the University of Hong Kong sports ground. No one was injured or killed except there were structural damages.
* 10 February 2018 – Maxim&#x27;s restaurant at HKU was the site of an anti shark finning protest.
* 15 February 2018 – HKU robotics professor Xi Ning was charged with submitting fraudulent requests for travel reimbursement to his previous employer, Michigan State University, and IEEE. After a trial resulted in a hung jury, the federal government dropped the charges.
* 3 December 2020 – HKU mechanical engineering associate professor Cheung Kie-Chung was convicted for murdering his wife. On 2 February 2024, a Hong Kong court ordered a retrial for Cheung after he successfully appealed against his murder conviction.
* 23 December 2021 – HKU removed the Pillar of Shame, a memorial to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. This act is widely regarded by the public as a violation of Hong Kong as the last land under the rule of the CCP where people can discuss and commemorate the protests and massacre, and an injury to freedom, democracy and human rights.

==Notable alumni==
The University of Hong Kong has educated many notable alumni in many varied fields. Among them is Dr Sun Yat-sen, the founder of
Republic of China,
who was a graduate of the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, the predecessor of HKU. Over 40 principal officials, permanent secretaries, Executive Council and Legislative Council members of the Hong Kong SAR Government are HKU graduates. HKU graduates also form the senior management teams of many large organizations in the private sector.

In recent years Professor Guan Yi became a notable figure when his research and work on SARS led to the successful identification of the SARS-Coronavirus and its infectious source from live animal markets and helped the Chinese Government successfully avert the second SARS outbreak in early 2004.

<text>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU or HKPU) is a public research university in Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The university is one of the eight government-funded degree-granting tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. Founded in 1937 as the first Government Trade School, it is the first institution to provide technical education in Hong Kong. In 1994, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong passed a bill which granted the former Hong Kong Polytechnic official university status.

PolyU consists of 8 faculties and schools, offering programmes covering applied science, business, construction, environment, engineering, social science, health, humanities, design, hotel and tourism management. The university offers over 160 taught programmes for more than 25,800 students every year. 

==History==

=== Government Trade School (1937–1947) ===
In 1937, the Government Trade School was founded at Wood Road, Wan Chai. The school was the first publicly funded, post-secondary technical institution in Hong Kong. Under George White, the then principal, it ran classes in marine wireless operating, mechanical engineering and building construction. The campus was a three-storey high Victorian architecture, and commonly referred to the &quot;Red Brick House&quot; by the locals. 

=== Hong Kong Technical College (1947–1972) ===
After World War II, the Government Trade School became the Hong Kong Technical College in 1947, offering both full-time and part-time courses. In 1957, the new campus of the college located in Hung Hom was constructed. It was opened by Sir Alexander Grantham, the then Governor of Hong Kong.

=== Hong Kong Polytechnic (1972–1994) ===
In 1965, Sir Chung Sze-yuen (S.Y. Chung) suggested establishing a polytechnic in Hong Kong to provide post-secondary technical education. Dr Tang Ping-yuen was appointed by the government as the chair of the Polytechnic Planning Committee in May 1969. On 24 March 1972, the Legislative Council passed the Hong Kong Polytechnic Ordinance and the institute was established. Sir Chung assumed the first chair of the Polytechnic Board of Directors (later renamed Polytechnic Council in 1978). The Polytechnic&#x27;s mandate was to provide professional-oriented education to meet the need for qualified workers. The institution launched its first five degree programmes in 1983, and introduced its first MPhil and PhD programmes in 1986 and 1989 respectively.

===Hong Kong Polytechnic University (1994–Present)===
In 1994, the university gained approval from the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee (UPGC; now UGC) for self-accreditation of degree programmes, without the restrictions from the Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance . With that, the Institution assumed full university status on 25 November 1994, changing its name to &quot;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University&quot;.

==Campuses==
=== Main campus ===
PolyU&#x27;s main campus, in Hung Hom, Kowloon, was designed by a team led by James Kinoshita from P&amp;T Group in 1972. It has over 20 buildings with red-brick walls, many of which are inter-connected and raised one floor above the podium, creating sheltered open-air spaces for multi-purposes such as logistics and parking. Apart from buildings named after donors, the rotundas which connects the buildings are identified in English letters (from cores and blocks A to Z, without K, O and I). It is one of the largest and densest educational campus in the world.

Block Z is the eighth phase of the campus expansion project. It is situated across the northwestern side of the main campus, separated by Chatham Road. It can be accessed through a pedestrian tunnel or a 80-meter-long footbridge, which was proposed in 2016 and built in 2019.

In addition to classrooms, laboratories and other academic facilities, the university provides a multi-purpose auditorium, recreational and catering facilities, medical facilities, as well as a bookstore and banks. The Jockey Club Auditorium began operation in 2000, its balcony and main floor seating accommodate up to 1,084 persons. It is specially designed as a multi-purpose venue for the hosting of conferences, seminars, ceremonies, corporate meetings, as well as the increasing number of cultural activities and performances, operas, chamber music, dramas, dances, film shows, variety shows, mini concerts etc.

There are multiple sports facilities, including two swimming pools (Block X and Michael Clinton Swimming Pool), 2 indoor sports grounds (Shaw Sports Complex and Kwong On Jubilee Sports Centre), an outdoor sports ground (Keith Legg Sports Field) with basketball and soccer fields and jogging track, 2 outdoor tennis courts, and a joint-sports centre.
====Pao Yue-kong Library====
The PolyU Library was established on 1 August 1972. Two centres operated in Hung Hom and Quarry Bay until 1976, when they eventually merged into the present building. It was named after shipping entrepreneur and philanthropist Yue-Kong Pao in 1995.

In 2014, there were over 2.77 million of library holdings in total, with nearly 600,000 electronic resources. The six-storey library provides 3,900 study spaces and is equipped with a 24-hour study centre and audio-visual information areas. In 2017, the 3/F and 4/F of the library was transformed into the &quot;i-space&quot; which contains services such as VR Experience Zone, Internet of Things (IoT), Laser Cutting / Engraving, 3D Scanning, Book Scanning, Large Format Printing, Vinyl Cutting and 3D Printing. Video production facilities such as the One button studio and Digital Studio are also available on the 3/F.

==== Innovation Tower ====
The Innovation Tower, designed by Zaha Hadid, is located on the northwestern side of the university&#x27;s main campus. This 15-story building provides 15,000 square meters of net floor area. It houses facilities for the School of Design, including exhibition areas, multi-functional classrooms and lecture theatres, design studios and workshops, as well as a communal lounge. The School of Design has been ranked among the best design schools worldwide.

=== Teaching and research hotel ===

The Hotel Icon was officially opened on 21 September 2011. The hotel is wholly owned by the university as a teaching and research hotel of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM). SHTM has consistently been ranked among the top hotel and tourism management schools in the world. 

===Hung Hom Bay and West Kowloon Campus===
The Hung Hom Bay Campus and West Kowloon Campus are the two satellite campuses which house the College of Professional and Continuing Education which is formed by two subsidiaries: the Hong Kong Community College (HKCC) and School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED).

Established in 2001 under the auspices of PolyU, HKCC is a self-financed post-secondary institution which offers associate degree and higher diploma programmes spanning the domains of arts, science, social sciences, business, health care and design for senior secondary school leavers. HKCC classes are conducted at the Hung Hom Bay and West Kowloon.

==Incidents==

=== Democracy wall controversy ===
The university&#x27;s faculty-led Student Discipline Committee, with the support of the university council chairman Lam Tai-fai, expelled one student and suspended another for one year in response to an October 2018 incident arising from a dispute over postings by students on the &quot;Democracy Wall&quot; bulletin board then managed by the students&#x27; union. The students had posted messages in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the &quot;Umbrella Movement&quot; democracy occupation protests of 2014 and calling for Hong Kong independence from the CCP-ruled People&#x27;s Republic of China. Another two students were ordered to serve terms of community service. The students had been ordered by management to take them down.

The evidence called at the disciplinary committee hearing, at which the students were denied legal representation, included video footage in which the students were observed shouting and knocking on doors. It was alleged that they had made defamatory comments, assaulted a staff member and damaged property, all of which accusations were denied by the students. The university described their behaviour as &quot;unruly&quot;. Among them were a former student union leader, an elected member of the school&#x27;s governing council and a former external vice-president of the student union. No avenue for appeal from a decision of the committee is available.

Numerous pro-democracy groups, including more than a dozen legislators and 19 student organisations, protested the decision of the committee. The 90,000-strong Hong Kong Professional Teachers&#x27; Union described the punishments as excessive.

=== 2019 campus siege ===

In November 2019, the university was occupied by protesters as part of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests; confrontation with the Hong Kong Police Force occurred from 17 November to 19 November. On 16 November, police attempted to enter the campus, but failed as protestors barricaded the entrance and used petrol bombs to attack them. The police then blocked all exits of the university campus and requested all protesters inside to surrender. On 18 November, the police attempted to enter the campus again using tear gas, rubber bullets, bean bags, and sponge grenades. Protestors responded by throwing petrol bombs at police. The university has been described as being a battleground during the conflict. The university was later sealed off by police, only several protesters managed to escape. This resulted in a 3-days long standoff. More than 280 protesters were injured while more than 1,000 persons were arrested.

<doc id="268079" wikidata="Q569224" url="?curid=268079" title="Armónico">
<text>The armónico, also known as trilina, is a guitar-like instrument from Cuba. It is a hybrid between the Spanish guitar and the Cuban tres. The armónico has seven strings: five single strings, plus one pair of strings tuned in unison. The armónico was invented by Cuban trova musician Compay Segundo, who loved the instrument as it allowed him to exploit the possibilities of both the guitar and the tres.

Counting from the lowest-pitched, the first three strings, E, A and D, are tuned an octave higher than the equivalent strings on a guitar with standard tuning. The fourth string, G, is doubled as well as also being an octave higher than on a guitar. The remaining two, B and E, are at the same pitch as a standard guitar. Therefore, the bottom E string is only one octave lower than the top E string on the armónico, instead of two octaves lower on the guitar.

<doc id="268081" wikidata="Q225360" url="?curid=268081" title="Flag of Bulgaria">
<text>The national flag of Bulgaria is a tricolour consisting of three equal-sized horizontal bands of (from top to bottom) white, green, and red. The flag was first adopted after the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, when Bulgaria gained de facto independence. The national flag at times had as a supplement the state emblem, especially during the communist era. The current flag was re-established with the 1991 Constitution of Bulgaria and was confirmed in a 1998 law.

==Historical flags==
===First Bulgarian Empire===
In 866, Pope Nicholas I advised Prince Boris who had recently Christianised his people to switch from the practice of using a horse tail as a banner to adopting the Holy Cross.

Later illuminated versions of the chronicles of John Skylitzes and Constantine Manasses depict the army of Khan Krum carrying flags either in monotone red, or red with a black border. The army of Simeon the Great is also depicted carrying red banners of varying shape. The Radziwiłł Chronicle also depicts Tzar Simeon I&#x27;s army under a red flag in the 921-922 campaign against Byzantium, but the depiction of the Hungarian invasion of 894 featured the Bulgarian fortress of Drastar under a white flag with a crescent and a six-pointed star. Any pictorial representations of flags in the manuscripts mentioned above, regardless of the faction or time depicted, conform strongly to the overall illustration style used in each manuscript. In addition, none of those manuscripts dates to the time of the First Bulgarian Empire. The historicity of those flags is thus impossible to verify.

===Second Bulgarian Empire===
Depictions of Bulgarian flags can be seen on various portolan maps from the 14th and 15th centuries. On those maps, the flags commonly have a white or golden background and depict either the insignia of the ruling House of Shishman, or unknown symbols in red. Those drawings are markedly more diverse than the flags of the neighbouring countries such as the Eastern Roman Empire, the Golden Horde or the Serbian Empire, which in the same maps are largely consistent.

===Third Bulgarian state===
After the liberation of Bulgaria following the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, the flag was described in the Tarnovo Constitution of 1879 as follows:

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria in 1946, the new Dimitrov Constitution of 1947 changed the flag: the colors and their order remained the same, but the new national emblem was placed on the left side of the white stripe. The new emblem contained a lion within a wreath of wheat ears below a red star and above a ribbon bearing the date 9.IХ.1944 (9 September 1944), the day of the coup d&#x27;état of 1944 which had ended the monarchy. In 1971, the emblem (and thus the flag) was slightly modified - the ribbon was parted in two, bearing the years 681 and 1944, the former being the year of the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire.

After the fall of Communism in 1990, the then-enforced Zhivkov Constitution was amended so the flag could be reverted to the pre-Communist era. The new Constitution of Bulgaria, adopted in 1991, describes the Bulgarian flag as follows:

A popular version of the flag, which has no official status, is also commonly known. It has the full coat of arms on the left of the flag, placed across the white and green fields only.

==Flag law==
According to the Law for the State Seal and National Flag of the Republic of Bulgaria, promulgated on 24 April 1998:

==Colours==
Appendix 2 to the Law for the State Seal and National Flag of the Republic of Bulgaria specifies colours when the flag is sewn from textiles or printed on paper.

The law does not specify what colour values should be used in digital renderings of the flag. The website of the Bulgarian civil service recommends approximate colours (note that the decimal RGB values are inconsistent with the hexadecimal &quot;web-safe&quot; values).

<doc id="268084" wikidata="Q428407" url="?curid=268084" title="Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses">
<text>Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are organized hierarchically, and are led by the Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses from the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s headquarters in Warwick, New York. The Governing Body, along with other &quot;helpers&quot;, is organized into six committees responsible for various administrative functions within the global Witness community, including publication, assembly programs, and evangelizing activity.

The Governing Body and its committees supervise the operations of nearly one hundred &quot;branch offices&quot; worldwide. Each branch office oversees the activities of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in a particular country or region and may include facilities for the publication and distribution of Watch Tower Society literature. Directly appointed by the Governing Body, branch committees supervise administrative functions for congregations in their jurisdiction. Congregations are further organized into &quot;circuits&quot; of about twenty congregations each. The Governing Body directly appoints &quot;circuit overseers&quot; as its representatives to supervise activities within circuits. &quot;Headquarters representatives&quot; visit groups of branch offices to provide instruction and report the branch&#x27;s activities to the Governing Body.

Each congregation is served by a group of locally recommended male &quot;elders&quot; and &quot;ministerial servants&quot;, appointed by the circuit overseer. Elders take responsibility for congregational governance, pastoral work, setting meeting times, selecting speakers, conducting meetings, directing the public preaching work, and forming &quot;committees&quot; to investigate and decide disciplinary action in cases where members are believed to have committed serious sins. Ministerial servants fulfill clerical and attendant duties, but may also teach and conduct meetings.

==Governing Body==

The organization is directed by the Governing Body—an all-male group that varies in size, but since October 2024 has had eleven members,—based in the Watchtower Society&#x27;s Warwick, New York headquarters. Each of the Governing Body members claims to be of the &quot;anointed class&quot; with a hope of heavenly life (whereas most Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses hope to be resurrected in an earthly paradise). There are no elections for membership; new members are selected by the existing body. Each of its members serves as chairman, with the position rotating among members alphabetically each year.

Until late 2012, the Governing Body described itself as the representative and &quot;spokesman&quot; of God&#x27;s &quot;faithful and discreet slave class&quot; (approximately 11,000 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who in 2010 professed to be &quot;anointed&quot;), providing &quot;spiritual food&quot; for Witnesses worldwide on behalf of the &quot;faithful and discreet slave class&quot;. In practice, it sought neither advice nor approval from other &quot;anointed&quot; Witnesses when formulating policies and doctrines, or when producing material for publications and conventions. At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society, the &quot;faithful and discreet slave&quot; was re-defined as referring to the Governing Body only.

From 1944, Watch Tower publications had made occasional references to a &quot;governing body&quot;, identifying it with the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. In October 1971, four additional men joined the seven members of the society&#x27;s board of directors on what became known as a separate, expanded Governing Body. The Governing Body was then for the first time formally defined, indicating that it provided Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses with direction, guidance, and regulation. All doctrinal and publishing decisions continued to be made by or were subject to, the approval of the society&#x27;s president. Organizational changes at the highest levels of the Watchtower Society in 1976 significantly increased the powers and authority of the Governing Body and reduced those of the Watch Tower Society president.

The Governing Body directs six committees comprising its members along with its &quot;helpers&quot;. The six committees are responsible for various administrative functions including personnel, publishing, evangelizing activity, school, and assembly programs, writing, and coordination. The Governing Body directly appoints all headquarters representatives, and circuit overseers, collectively referred to as &quot;traveling overseers&quot;, and also appoints branch office committee members. Only branch committee members and traveling overseers are referred to as &quot;representatives of the Governing Body&quot;.

In the last decade, the Governing Body has reiterated its overall oversight role but has delegated other Witnesses, typically branch committee members, to serve as corporate executives and directors of Watch Tower and other incorporated entities.
==Branch offices==

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses operate 87 branch offices worldwide, under the oversight of &quot;headquarters representatives&quot; who visit each of their assigned branches every few years, auditing operations, counseling branch committee members, department heads, and missionaries, and reporting back to the Governing Body. Each branch office is referred to as Bethel. The United States branch office, spread across three New York State locations with a staff of more than 5000, also serves as the international headquarters.

Branch offices, operated by Witness volunteers known as &quot;Bethel families&quot;, produce and distribute Bible-based literature and communicate with congregations within their jurisdiction. Full-time staff at branch offices take a vow of poverty and are members of a religious order. Each branch is overseen by a committee of three or more elders, which is appointed by the Governing Body. A Service Department in each branch corresponds with congregations and supervises the work of traveling overseers. Branch offices may also have departments responsible for printing, translation, and legal representation.

Each branch office appoints various committees in its jurisdiction&#x27;s communities, with local elders as members. Committees may include:
* &quot;Hospital Liaison Committee&quot;
* &quot;Patient Visitation Group&quot;
* &quot;Regional Building Committee&quot;
* &quot;Assembly Hall Committee&quot;
* &quot;District Convention Committee&quot;
* &quot;Disaster Relief Committee&quot;

==Traveling overseers==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses use the term &quot;traveling overseer&quot; to refer to headquarters representatives and circuit overseers, all of whom are elders. All traveling overseers are directly appointed by the Governing Body. A branch may appoint qualified local elders as &quot;substitute&quot; circuit overseers. Additional training is provided at their &quot;School for Traveling Overseers&quot;, and ongoing pastoral care and instruction are provided to them by senior branch office representatives. In 1995, Witnesses reported that 4374 traveling overseers cared for 78,620 congregations, an average of about 18 congregations each.

The majority of traveling overseers are &quot;circuit overseers&quot;; they oversee circuits of about twenty congregations, performing twice-yearly week-long visits with each. During his visit, the circuit overseer delivers talks to the congregation and meets with the elders, ministerial servants, and pioneers. He is responsible for appointing new elders and ministerial servants, based on recommendations by elders. He typically works with various members of the congregation in the house-to-house preaching work, and may also conduct personal Bible studies and pastoral calls.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are instructed to &quot;participate in a joyful interchange of encouragement&quot; with traveling overseers, and to render them &quot;double honor&quot;, a biblical term they believe includes cooperation and hospitality. Traveling overseers are generally members of a religious order who have taken a vow of poverty; they are provided with vehicles, healthcare, and lodging, and their basic expenses are reimbursed by the congregations they visit.

==Congregations==
Congregations are usually based on geographical area or language spoken and may have as few as ten or as many as two hundred members. Congregations meet for religious services at Kingdom Halls, which may be shared by two or more congregations. If a small group of Witnesses is isolated by geography or language, it may have some or all of its meetings at a different time and place to the rest of the congregation, under the supervision of that congregation&#x27;s body of elders. If a group intends to become a new congregation, the area&#x27;s circuit overseer submits an application to the branch office.

Each congregation is assigned a &quot;territory&quot;; members are requested to attend the congregation of the territory in which they reside. Members also meet in smaller &quot;field service groups&quot;, often at private homes, prior to engaging in organized door-to-door preaching. Each field service group has an appointed &quot;group overseer&quot; (an elder) or &quot;group servant&quot; (a ministerial servant). Witnesses are instructed to devote as much time as possible to preaching activities (&quot;witnessing&quot; or &quot;field service&quot;) and to provide a monthly report to their congregation summarizing their preaching activity. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses consider all baptized Witnesses to be ministers. Participants in organized preaching activities are referred to as &quot;publishers&quot;. Only individuals who are approved and active as publishers are officially counted as members.

Congregations are governed by local &quot;elders&quot;, who are assisted by &quot;ministerial servants&quot;. Elders and ministerial servants are appointed in each congregation to handle various religious and administrative duties. Only male members may serve in the capacity of elder or ministerial servant. In smaller congregations, one man may handle multiple positions until another qualified candidate is available. Baptized female members may perform some of their duties only if a baptized male is unavailable; female Witnesses leading in prayer or teaching are required to wear a head covering.

===Elders===
Each congregation has a body of elders, who are responsible for congregational governance, pastoral work, selecting speakers and conducting meetings, directing the public preaching work, and creating committees to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases that are seen to breach scriptural laws.

There are no secular educational requirements for elders; however, training programs are offered for elders within the organization. Elders are considered &quot;overseers&quot; based on the biblical Greek term, &quot;ἐπίσκοπος&quot; (&quot;episkopos&quot;, typically translated &quot;bishop&quot;). Prospective elders are recommended from among ministerial servants and former elders by the local elder body for appointment by the circuit overseer.

Particular roles within the body of elders include:

*&quot;Congregation Secretary&quot;: maintains congregation records, reports congregation activity to the branch office, advises the congregation about conventions and assemblies, and oversees those handling accounts.
*&quot;Coordinator of the Body of Elders&quot;: chairs elders&#x27; meetings, assigns duties and speakers for most congregation meetings,and cares for certain financial matters.
*&quot;Group Overseers&quot;: oversees groups for public preaching and pastoral care.
*&quot;Life and Ministry Meeting Overseer&quot;: ensures that the Life and Ministry Meeting is handled according to the instructions set by the Watch Tower Society and schedules student assignments.
*&quot;Watchtower Study Conductor&quot;: leads the weekly study of &quot;The Watchtower&quot;.
*&quot;Operating Committee Members&quot;: responsible for the care of the building and property of Kingdom Halls that are shared by two or more congregations.
*&quot;Public Talk Coordinator&quot;: schedules speakers and talks for public meetings and coordinates traveling speakers from his congregation.
*&quot;Service Overseer&quot;: organizes matters related to public preaching, and oversees those handling Witness literature and territories.
*&quot;Auxilary Counselor&quot;: Gives private counsel (if needed) to elders and ministerial servants on any part they may give on stage. His goal is help them improve as teachers.

===Ministerial servants===
Ministerial servants, equivalent to deacons, are appointed to assist the elders with routine work, including the supply of literature to the congregation, and accounts, maintaining the Kingdom Hall, and operating audiovisual equipment. They also present various parts at the meetings. Ministerial servants are appointed in a similar manner to elders.

The following roles are normally filled by ministerial servants:

*&quot;Accounts Servant&quot;: collects donations from contribution boxes after each meeting, deposits money, and pays bills.
*&quot;Audio/Video Support Coordinator&quot;: coordinates and schedules others to run microphones, handle the stage and podium, and operate audio/video equipment. Also ensures that the meeting is broadcast via Zoom or other service for the benefit of any who cannot attend in person.
*&quot;Literature Servant&quot;: distributes literature, and handles requests for special items, or yearly items for use by congregation members. May place special request orders for publishers in their own Kingdom Hall.
*&quot;Cleaning Coordinator&quot;: Oversees and schedules regular cleaning of the Kingdom Hall.
*&quot;Territory Servant&quot;: distributes territory maps for preaching and keeps records of all territories within the congregation&#x27;s area.
*&quot;Attendant/Security Servant&quot;: greets visitors, seats latecomers, takes a count of attendance, and is responsible for climate control of the Kingdom Hall and parking lot security.
*&quot;Christian Life and Ministry Assistant&quot;: in larger congregation, appointed to help the Christian Life and Ministry Overseer. His duties can include sending out reminders for those who have parts, finding replacements for parts, handing out assignment slips. May also help with scheduling and as a Secondary School Counselor for student parts.
*&quot;Group Servant&quot;: assumes the role of Group Overseer when a sufficient number of elders is not available, under the supervision of the body of elders.

===Baptized publishers===
Baptized publishers are members who have been publicly baptized following conversion to the faith. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not practice infant baptism, and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid. Prior to baptism, they are required to respond to a series of questions to assess their suitability and to make a personal dedication to serve God. Baptisms are typically performed at assemblies and conventions. From the moment of baptism, the organization officially considers the person to be a member of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and an ordained minister.

Regular publishers do not have a specific quota of hours for preaching each month, but publishers are requested to &quot;set goals such as reaching [the] national average of hours for publishers&quot;. Publishers are typically required to report at least one hour per month to be counted as a &#x27;regular publisher&#x27;. Generally, only whole hours are reported and partial hours are carried over to the next month, though publishers limited by advanced age or serious health conditions may be allowed to report fifteen-minute increments.

Publishers who fail to report for one month are termed &quot;irregular&quot; and those who do not report for six consecutive months are called &quot;inactive&quot;. The terms &quot;irregular&quot; and &quot;inactive&quot; are used to identify members in need of &#x27;spiritual assistance&#x27; from congregation elders; those who are habitually &#x27;irregular&#x27; or &#x27;inactive&#x27; are usually restricted from serving in any special capacity. Yearly reports of congregation activity are compiled and published by the Watch Tower Society.

Baptized publishers considered to be exemplary may serve in various special preaching capacities:

*&quot;&quot;: make a commitment of 15 or 30 hours of preaching activities for a given month. This can be performed on a per-month or ongoing basis.
*&quot;&quot;: make a commitment of 50 hours of preaching activity each month, totaling 600 hours for the year. For congregation elders to recommend the appointment of a regular pioneer, a publisher must be baptized for at least six months and be considered an exemplary member of the congregation. Members who have been reproved or reinstated in the last year may not serve as regular pioneers.
*&quot;: assigned by a branch to perform a special activity, such as preaching in remote areas, which may require at least 130 hours per month. Special pioneers receive a stipend for basic living expenses.
*&quot;: sent to foreign countries to preach. They spend at least 130 hours per month in preaching. Before assignment to a location, missionaries may receive training at Gilead School. Missionaries receive a stipend for basic living expenses.

====Children====
When accompanied by adults, children of baptized Witnesses may participate in organized preaching without formally qualifying. However, only those recognized as publishers are counted in the denomination&#x27;s official membership statistics. Children of Witness parents may be asked to participate in demonstrations at congregation meetings and assemblies or as models and actors in materials published by the Watch Tower Society.

===Unbaptized publishers===
&quot;Unbaptized publishers&quot; are persons who are not yet baptized, but who have requested and been granted approval to join in the congregation&#x27;s formal ministry. They must demonstrate a basic knowledge of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; doctrines to the elders, state their desire to be a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and conform to the organization&#x27;s moral standards. To qualify as an unbaptized publisher, an individual must already be &quot;an active associate of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;, regularly attending congregation meetings.

Prior to 1988, unbaptized publishers were referred to as &quot;approved associates&quot;, &quot;unbaptized associates&quot; or &quot;regularly associating&quot;. The terms were discontinued on the basis that meeting attendance on its own does not constitute approval of or commitment to the faith.

===Students===
The term &quot;Bible student&quot;, sometimes informally referred to as a &quot;Bible study&quot;, is generally used by Witnesses to refer to an individual who takes part in their religious study program. The purpose of the Bible study program is for the student to become baptized as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness.

Students usually have their study with the same Witness for the duration of the study program, often being the member who first encounters them while preaching. Interested individuals initially contacted by a member of the opposite sex are typically assigned a study conductor of their own gender. A student typically meets with his or her study conductor once each week at the student&#x27;s home or other suitable location, or via videoconferencing. The study program involves consideration of a Bible-based publication that addresses Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; core beliefs.

Each paragraph is read aloud by the conductor or student, and the student answers pre-printed questions from the material in the paragraph. Students are encouraged to look up cited scriptures in the Bible and include them in their responses. Each Bible study is typically conducted with an individual or family, though in some cases many people may take part. Students are invited to attend and even comment at congregation meetings. Students may also attend reading-improvement or literacy classes in congregations where these additional courses are held.

===Associates===
Individuals who attend meetings of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses but are not involved in preaching are occasionally referred to in Watch Tower Society publications as &quot;associates&quot; or as being &quot;associated with the congregation&quot;. Attendance figures for Witness events include &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and associates&quot;; such statistics may be cited for comparison of Witness numbers with membership figures of other denominations, but only those sharing in their ministry are counted by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses when reporting their official statistics.

Unbaptized individuals who attend meetings of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are not subject to congregation discipline, though elders may privately warn members of the congregation about individuals considered to constitute &quot;an unusual threat to the flock.&quot;

<doc id="268090" wikidata="Q3117103" url="?curid=268090" title="ITV Yorkshire">
<text>ITV Yorkshire, previously known as Yorkshire Television and commonly referred to as just YTV, is the British television service provided by ITV Broadcasting Limited for the Yorkshire franchise area on the ITV network. Until 1974, this was primarily the historic county of Yorkshire (with the exception of the northern areas of North Yorkshire which are served by Tyne Tees) and parts of neighbouring counties served by the Emley Moor transmitter. Following a reorganisation in 1974 the transmission area was extended to include Lincolnshire, northwestern Norfolk and parts of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, served by the Belmont transmitter.

Two consortia applied for the franchise, &quot;Telefusion Yorkshire Ltd&quot; and &quot;Yorkshire Independent Television&quot;, the former having large financial backing (supported by the Blackpool-based &quot;Telefusion&quot; television rental chain) and the latter having the better plans but fewer resources.

On 1 January 2007, the company transferred its programme production business to ITV Studios Limited. As a consequence, Yorkshire Television Limited ceased to trade on 1 January 2007. Yorkshire Television Ltd still legally exists, but its licence is now owned and operated by ITV plc under the licence name of ITV Broadcasting Limited (along with all the other ITV plc-owned franchises). Yorkshire Television Ltd is, along with most other regional companies owned by ITV plc, listed with Companies House as a dormant company.

== History ==
ITV Yorkshire, previously known as Yorkshire Television, and sometimes abbreviated to YTV or Yorkshire, has its origins in the 1967 franchise round. That round stipulated that the influential pan-North region, the licence which was owned by Granada Television and ABC, both based in Manchester, had to be split up. Consequently, it was decided that Granada would keep the North West franchise and a new franchise created for Yorkshire.

On 28 February 1967, national and regional newspapers carried numerous advertisements from the Independent Television Authority, each requesting applicants for various new ITV contracts, one of which was &quot;Programme Contractor for Yorkshire Area (Contract D) – All Week&quot;. Ten formal bids were received by the closing date; another less-serious bid, &quot;Diddy TV&quot;, headed by comedian Ken Dodd withdrew their application.

&quot;Telefusion Yorkshire Limited&quot;, created by the Blackpool-based TV rental chain &quot;Telefusion &quot;and led by Grampian TV Managing Director G E Ward Thomas, was selected as the winning bid. It was chosen on the condition that it &#x27;merged&#x27; with another applicant &quot;Yorkshire Independent Television&quot;. The latter, backed by a consortium of Yorkshire Post Newspapers Ltd, other local newspaper groups such as the &quot;Huddersfield Examiner&quot; and the &quot;Scarborough Evening News&quot;, several Yorkshire-based Co-operative societies, trade unions and local universities, was deemed by the Authority to have the better talent but suffered a lack of funding, whereas Telefusion had the backing of a cash-rich parent. The new venture initially chose the name &quot;Yorkshire Television Network&quot; but decided to drop the word &#x27;Network&#x27; before going on air. A few days after winning, the chairman Sir Richard Graham said: &quot;We see ourselves as having a particular responsibility to convey to a mature audience the particular qualities and strengths of one of the most populous and most important areas outside London.&quot;

The station began broadcasting on 29 July 1968 from new studios at Kirkstall Road in Leeds. Although they were purpose-built for colour production and equipped with £2.2 million of equipment, the majority of initial broadcasts were in monochrome until the ITV network formally launched its colour output on 15 November 1969. After an opening ceremony led by The Duchess of Kent, the station&#x27;s first programme was live coverage of the Test cricket match between England and Australia at Headingley. Other programmes broadcast on YTV&#x27;s opening day included the first edition of its regional news programme &quot;Calendar&quot;, the station&#x27;s first networked production – the &#x27;Playhouse&#x27; drama &quot;Daddy Kiss it Better&quot; – and a light entertainment special, &quot;First Night&quot;, hosted by Bob Monkhouse.
The station was hit hard financially when the transmitter mast at Emley Moor collapsed in March 1969 under a heavy build-up of ice. This left the major part of the region uncovered by Yorkshire Television plus BBC2 who broadcast from the same mast. A temporary mast was quickly erected and television to the West Riding of Yorkshire resumed, albeit with reduced coverage. From this, the company grew and by May 1970 the company was making profits of over £689,000. After a series of temporary masts at Emley Moor, the current 275 metre reinforced concrete tower — topped by a 55-metre steel lattice mast — began transmitting in 1971, resuming full area coverage for the YTV region.

In June 1969, talks began between Yorkshire and Anglia about achieving a cost-cutting exercise by sharing equipment and facilities. Neither company planned joint productions or a merger. The decision to form an association was purely down to the costs of the increased levy on the companies&#x27; advertising revenue by the government, and the cost of colour TV. The ITA stated there was no reason why the companies should not have talks about sensible economies that could be made, but would examine all details before any association were to be implemented. In January 1970, a warning was given that regionalism would be abandoned and a forced merger with Anglia Television would happen unless the chancellor reduced the levy applied on advertising revenues, which was also not helped by the high cost with colour television and the introduction of UHF, which the government agreed to a few months later.

With the introduction of UHF broadcasting, YTV had failed to gain the Bilsdale transmitter in North Yorkshire, which was allocated instead to Tyne Tees Television due to the transmitter&#x27;s penetration into Teesside and County Durham. This seriously reduced YTV&#x27;s monopoly commercial broadcast area. Partially to address this issue, in 1974 the Independent Broadcasting Authority reallocated the Belmont Transmitter, then served by Anglia Television, to YTV. Although the area served by Belmont was largely rural, it did cover the more industrial centres of Hull, Grimsby, Scunthorpe and Lincoln and it was felt the region would be better served from Leeds rather than from Norwich.

=== Trident Television ===

In August 1970 following a reverse takeover Yorkshire Television was effectively merged with its neighbour Tyne Tees Television, when the two were brought under the control of Trident Television Limited, a company formed to deal with the problem of effective ownership of the Bilsdale transmitter and the allocation of airtime. It is often contended that the other point of the &quot;trident&quot; was intended to be Anglia Television, but they were prevented from joining by the Independent Broadcasting Authority. However, it appears that the third &#x27;point&#x27; was to be Trident&#x27;s non-television interests and that Anglia were never considered as partners in the enterprise.

The two stations remained separately run and were required to demerge by late 1981 as a condition of the re-awarding of their ITV contracts from January 1982. Trident&#x27;s majority shareholdings were sold although they retained ownership of studios and equipment which were leased to the respective companies.

On 28 March 1977, Yorkshire launched a breakfast television experiment. &quot;Good Morning Calendar&quot; is credited as being the UK&#x27;s first breakfast television programme, six years before the launch of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;. The programme ran concurrently with a similar Tyne Tees programme, &quot;Good Morning North&quot; for North East viewers. Both series ended after nine weeks on 27 May 1977.

=== 1970s: Industrial relations ===

From its inception YTV had a turbulent relationship with the broadcasting unions (a common theme within ITV). Many employees at the new company were recruited from the Manchester and Birmingham studios of the former ABC Weekend Television and the London station Rediffusion; the upheaval of enforced job changes on these employees combined with a relatively new management of a new ITV station and huge investment by shareholders provided fertile ground for the unions.

In 1971, technicians broadcast a handwritten note that read &quot;&#x27;Yorkshire Television have threatened to sack us. We are going on strike. Goodnight.&quot; six minutes before the end of &quot;Kate&quot;. A black screen appeared before that evening&#x27;s &quot;News at Ten&quot; was broadcast. The dispute was involving ACTT union members who had refused to work overtime due to pay rates.

YTV was forced off the air by more industrial action over the whole of Christmas, 1978. This partially coincided with a two-day national shutdown of both BBC channels by strikes in December of that year, meaning that for those two days viewers in the region had no television at all (except for those viewers who were able to pick up neighbouring ITV regions such as Granada, ATV or Tyne Tees regions). Many of ITV&#x27;s Christmas programmes were eventually shown in the Yorkshire region in early 1979, after the dispute had ended.

In the ITV strike of 1979, the station, like the rest of the network, was off the air for over two months (although appeals by the West Yorkshire Police in their search for the murderer known as the Yorkshire Ripper were periodically transmitted during the strike). However the dispute was more intense at YTV as the company&#x27;s management were seen as instrumental in fighting the unions, especially the managing director Sir Paul Fox and Trident chairman G E Ward Thomas.

In the 1980 franchise round several YTV staff submitted their own application for the Yorkshire franchise under the name of &#x27;Television Yorkshire&#x27;. Backed by Donald Baverstock and MP Jonathan Aiken who believed they would provide a better service. Yorkshire retained the franchise with the addition of number of relay transmitters on the Lancashire/Yorkshire border, covering Todmorden and Walsden, which were transferred from the Granada region.

=== 1980s/later broadcasting years===

On 9 August 1986, Yorkshire Television became the first ITV company and the first British terrestrial television station to offer 24-hour broadcasting. This was achieved by simulcasting the satellite station Music Box for a three-month trial, as permitted by the IBA. The all-night simulcasts continued until Friday 2 January 1987 – shortly before Music Box ceased operations as a broadcaster. Thereafter, Yorkshire ran a teletext-based &quot;Jobfinder&quot; service for one hour after closedown with a &quot;Through Till Three&quot; strand on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights introduced a few months later. 24-hour broadcasting resumed on 29 May 1988.

In 1982, after the split up of Trident Television, Bass (brewing and Leisure group) acquired a 20.93% share in Yorkshire TV. In July 1987, Bass sold the stake since it no longer fitted in with its operations. The managing director of YTV said: &quot;We are very sorry to lose Bass as a shareholder; they have been very supportive to Yorkshire Television.&quot; By the end of the year, YTV profits had increased to £13.94 million, and it had become one of the largest suppliers of programmes to Channel 4. In October 1987, the production unit had received a co-production pact with Telecom Entertainment in order to co-produce and develop projects, that involved international stars and British crew, around the world and it involved co-productions and projects that came from the deal included the rights to four M. M. Kaye novels for her &quot;Death In&quot; book series, as well as &quot;The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank&quot;, for CBS and ITV.

In March 1988, Paul Fox left the company to join the BBC, after spending 15 years as Yorkshire managing director. A month later, Paul Mckess resigned. A member of staff said &quot;It comes as a surprise to us, but we don&#x27;t think there had been a row or anything like that&quot;. Clive Leach became managing director.

In preparation of the new ITV franchises, the company started to cut costs which resulted in 91 voluntary redundancies; this had a minor effect with slightly fewer programmes being produced.

=== 1990s: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc ===

Following rule changes in 1992, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees resumed their alliance under the name Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television (YTTT) plc. The two stations were integrated to a far greater extent. Following the takeover, 292 jobs were axed at the two broadcasters; 174 at Leeds, and 115 at Newcastle, with a further three from airtime sales in London. Various programmes which had previously been shown at a regional pace were suddenly jolted forward to the furthest ahead point among YTV and Tyne Tees. YTV had to lose over 200 episodes of &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; to reach the Tyne Tees stage of the serial. Similarly Tyne Tees had to lose over 50 episodes of &quot;Blockbusters&quot; and two episodes of &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;. Other programmes were also affected.

On 6 December 1993, the North West franchise holder Granada Television launched a hostile takeover for LWT, worth £600 million. LWT tried to outstep the takeover bid by holding talks with Yorkshire Television and Scottish Television. Reports suggested if LWT made a bid for Yorkshire Television, it would also form an alliance with Anglia Television who would take over Tyne Tees Television. By 7 January 1994 the merger talks between Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television had collapsed because it had proven impossible to reach an agreement on a suitable structure for the new company. A few days earlier Anglia had withdrawn from the proposed alliance, making an LWT takeover of YTV impossible.

The company faced a large revenue shortfall in 1993 of around £15 million, after financial irregularities in its advertising sales, where airtime was oversold, was uncovered by Laser Sales who took over responsibly of its advertising sales. Generally the bids submitted by both YTV and (then-independent) Tyne Tees were considered financially questionable, and the Independent Television Commission, predecessor to Ofcom, warned it came close to rejecting the YTV bid on financial quality grounds. The losses suffered by the company prompted the return of founder Ward Thomas as chairman, and Clive Leach was forced to resign. The rescue mission led by Ward Thomas saw profits recover by 1996, thanks to the cost-cutting measures implemented in the intervening years.

Bruce Gyngell, the former chairman of breakfast station TV-am, became YTTT&#x27;s managing director on 15 May 1995. On 2 September 1996, Bruce Gyngell made the controversial move of re-branding Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television under the unified brand &quot;Channel 3&quot; While Yorkshire used a scaled-back version of this branding (still using the Yorkshire chevron logo and being verbally known as &quot;Channel 3 Yorkshire&quot;), Tyne Tees was re-branded as &quot;Channel 3 North East&quot;. It dropped the familiar TTTV logo, and relegated the Tyne Tees name to secondary branding.

=== Granada plc and ITV plc ===
On 26 June 1997, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc was acquired by Granada Group plc (now ITV plc). Granada&#x27;s first move was to scrap the Channel 3 branding, from 9 March 1998. However, dual branding with the &quot;ITV&quot; name was introduced a year later. In 1998, transmission operations and presentation for all of Granada&#x27;s stations in the North of England moved to Yorkshire, with the creation of the Northern Transmission Centre. This highly automated server based system was the source to Border, Tyne Tees and Granada as well as the Yorkshire regional output. Continuity from Leeds ended in October 2002, after a unified presentation department for ITV1 in England was set up by London News Network. The transmission operation continues at the Kirkstall Road studios, under the ownership of Technicolor SA. Since 2004, the centre has also provided playout for ITV Central.

On 28 October 2002, Yorkshire Television was rebranded as ITV1 Yorkshire. The ITV1 Yorkshire branding continued to appear before some regional programming until November 2006, when a rebrand saw the sole local ident discontinued. The famous chevron logo continued to appear after programmes made by ITV Yorkshire until 31 October 2004. Today, networked programming made at the Leeds studios by ITV is credited to ITV Studios. ITV Yorkshire is also home to Shiver Productions.

The licence for Yorkshire is now held by ITV Broadcasting Limited, part of ITV plc.

== Studios ==


The studios were built on of slum clearance land on Kirkstall Road, purchased from the former Leeds Corporation.

Construction commenced in early 1967. A mild winter aided building work and by mid-1968 studios one and two were equipped for transmission (studios three and four being completed by early 1969). During construction, pre-launch shows were produced at the ABC studios at Didsbury, Manchester while a former trouser-press factory next to the Leeds facility was used as an administration centre.

The studio was officially opened by The Duchess of Kent on 29 July 1968. It was the first purpose-built colour television production centre in Europe and cost over £4 million to build and equip. Equipment was installed by EMI Electronics and the Marconi Corporation. The studios contained seven 2&quot; Quadruplex VTR machines, six telecines and twelve cameras. The cameras were a mixture of Marconi MkVII&#x27;s (studios 1, 2 and 3) and EMI 2001 models (studio 4).

The regional news show &quot;Calendar&quot; was produced at the centre for many years but in 1989 was moved to a dedicated newsroom and broadcast facility based in a converted ice rink next to the main studios.

Productions in the 2000s included &quot;Countdown&quot; (which has since moved to The Manchester Studios and now Media City in Salford), the revived &quot;Bullseye&quot;, &quot;Mastermind&quot; (while asbestos was removed from The Manchester Studios in 2006), &quot;My Parents Are Aliens&quot;, Channel 4 gameshow &quot;Win My Wage&quot; and a children&#x27;s comedy-drama for Cartoon Network called &quot;My Spy Family&quot;. The site is now home to continuity for ITV&#x27;s northern transmission areas (although this is now managed, along with its southern counterpart, by Technicolor Network Services) and a number of independent producers. The production facilities are marketed as The Leeds Studios and sister companies ProVision, Film Lab North and The Finishing School occupy adjacent buildings, although the operation continues to be widely referred to as the Yorkshire Television studios or YTV.

In March 2009, ITV plc announced that the Leeds Studios were to be largely closed in an effort to save costs following a reported loss of £2.7 billion for 2008. However, seven months later ITV changed its mind, choosing instead to close the nearby studios dedicated to the production of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and transferring production of this programme to Kirkstall Road which would be upgraded for HDTV production.

== Identity ==

For almost 35 years, Yorkshire Television&#x27;s on-screen identity always revolved around the use of the station logo: the chevron. This yellow symbol was seen on nearly all of Yorkshire Television&#x27;s idents and presentation. The first symbol used was a black and white chevron, formed by slit-scan techniques and accompanied by an orchestral version of the tune &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot;, a famous Yorkshire folk song. This music was later to become the station&#x27;s jingle. This ident continued until Yorkshire Television officially commenced their colour broadcasts on 15 November 1969.

The new colour ident featured the yellow chevron on a black background with the still caption card &quot;Yorkshire Television Colour Production&quot;, along with a simplified version of &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot;. This ident was modified in 1981, so that the caption &quot;Colour Production&quot; was changed to &quot;In Colour&quot;, and in 1982 the colour caption was removed altogether. The new version of the jingle was at a lower pitch than was previously composed.

Supplementing the ident throughout this period were idents promoting the station&#x27;s coverage, with the slogan &quot;Serving Six Million Viewers&quot;. One version, in 1983 featured a giant chevron logo, made up out of smaller chevrons, and another in 1986 featured the view zooming in from space, to the Yorkshire TV region, which then flipped over, becoming the chevron. This last version was computer-animated, with 3D-style lettering and chevron.

On 5 January 1987, Yorkshire Television introduced a new ident, entitled &quot;Liquid Gold&quot;, featuring a pool of liquified gold, with the chevron rising up from it, and rotating into the sky, where the station name joins it. This ident features a fully orchestrated version of the theme tune and reportedly cost £40,000 to make. This was occasionally supplemented by a large rotating chevron over a gradient-ed blue background, used over continuity.

On 1 September 1989, Yorkshire Television adopted the first ITV generic look, featuring the large ITV logo; an additional ident, with a static chevron on the same background, was also used. On 7 January 1991, the ident was revised to allow the chevron to appear full screen instead of being a segment of the &#x27;V&#x27; which the company used until 21 October 1994. The whole package was used by Yorkshire Television, and an adapted version, where the whole chevron appeared in the V segment before moving into centre screen, was used before regional programming.

===1990s===
Upon YTV dropping the generic look on 22 October 1994, a new ident was introduced, featuring a textured background with a central strip containing images of the region itself, with the chevron placed in the centre of said strip. The most noticeable thing about this ident set was the smooth nature of the chevron&#x27;s appearance and, like the previous look, did not feature the &quot;&quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot; &quot;jingle, instead favouring a smooth orchestral jingle. The background was later changed from a cream to a light blue, and variations on the theme for special occasions and yearly themes were also introduced.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television adopted a new branding package, based on the concept of Channel 3. The new look was fully implemented in the Tyne Tees region on 2 September 1996, where all on-screen branding was replaced by giant numeral &#x27;3&#x27;, and the Tyne Tees brand became secondary to &#x27;Channel 3 North East&#x27;, however the look was only partially implemented in the Yorkshire region a month after Tyne Tees&#x27;s revamp. The entirety of Yorkshire&#x27;s Channel 3 look included an ident which was later introduced on 21 October 1996 at the same year, where the chevron spun against a light blue background with numeral &#x27;3&#x27;s covering the background.

Another ident featured the chevron with the &#x27;3&#x27; numeral embossed on the side, which would zoom into view, before revealing a spinning numeral 3, which in turn had YTV chevron on the middle of the 3 and when zoomed into, the chevron re-appeared spinning against the background. The look also heralded the return of the &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot; tune, which was now noticeably higher in pitch.

The Channel 3 look was dropped on 19 January 1998, following Granada&#x27;s acquisition of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television on 26 June 1997, with the look returning to a spinning chevron against a misty blue background, light blue during the day and dark blue in the evenings.

On 8 November 1999, Yorkshire Television adopted the second generic look, based on the theme of hearts, which was used for the entirety of the branding period before network programming. However, for local programming, Yorkshire created their own ident featuring a background of spinning chevrons, with pictures of the region featuring inside a central box.

===2000s===
On 28 October 2002, the brand was dropped in favour of a national ITV1 identity, in which local regional identities were dropped except before local programming, when the Yorkshire name appeared below the ITV1 logo only. These regional idents however were dropped by 2006.

=== Broadcasting ===
The company invested heavily in outside broadcast facilities and was a large contributor to ITV Sport, responsible primarily for covering northern-based horserace meetings (with London Weekend Television and Thames Television covering the south and ATV covering the Midlands) amongst other sporting events.

In the field of investigative journalism the station soon gained an international reputation for award-winning documentaries: 1975 saw the transmission of the BAFTA award-winning &quot;Johnny Go Home&quot;, a startling exposé of teenage male prostitution and homelessness in London. In the same year the station transmitted &quot;Too Long a Winter&quot; (also a BAFTA award-winner), featuring Yorkshire Daleswoman Hannah Hauxwell who lived an austere and harsh life whilst running her small farm.

In 1979 the documentary &quot;Rampton: The Secret Hospital&quot;, making public the treatment of patients at the Nottinghamshire mental care facility Rampton Hospital, led to a Government investigation – it also won an international Emmy award for the station. 
Another 1979 documentary &quot;The Underground Eiger&quot; detailed the record-breaking cave dive of Oliver Statham and Geoff Yeadon. 
The 1989 documentary &quot;Four Hours in My Lai&quot; (broadcast as part of the monthly &quot;First Tuesday&quot; strand) revealed new information about the 1968 massacre. Yorkshire Television also produced the 1989 documentary &quot;One Day in the Life of Television&quot;.

YTV often led the way in British commercial broadcasting. As well as building the first purpose-built colour studios on Europe it was the first to offer breakfast television. In 1977, the station took part in a nine-week trial offering viewers an extra hour of programming at breakfast time, beginning transmission at 8:30 am with a 15-minute national and regional news bulletin called &quot;Good Morning Calendar&quot; alongside cartoons and episodes of &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. A similar experiment was carried out by Tyne Tees Television around the same time.

In August 1986, it became the first terrestrial station in Britain to offer 24-hour television. This was achieved by simulcasting the satellite station Music Box from around midnight to the start of TV-am&#x27;s transmission. Both YTV and Music Box were partly owned by the same company (Thorn EMI). The experiment ended shortly before Music Box closed down in January 1987 and was replaced by a teletext-based Jobfinder service which broadcast for one hour after closedown. YTV re-introduced 24-hour programming 18 months later along with the rest of the ITV network, beginning full-time 24-hour broadcasting on 30 May 1988.

In the mid-1980s, Yorkshire broke from the network by refusing to screen the BAFTA Awards, claiming them to be slaps on the backs of the BBC. The film &quot;The Sting&quot; was a replacement in 1986. As the rest of the network overran in the live BAFTA screening, Yorkshire had to cobble together minor programmes until other regions were able to screen the late-running ITN News. In the 1990s, while Bruce Gyngell was managing director, Yorkshire declined to show several late-night programmes, including &quot;The Good Sex Guide&quot;. One such series, &quot;Hollywood Lovers&quot;, was replaced with Alan Whicker repeats.

== Yorkshire Television subsidiaries ==
Yorkshire Television had its own record label, York Records. One of the Yorkshire shows that had a theme released on their label was &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; which was hosted by Hughie Green. The theme &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; was the B side to &quot;Any Minute of Your Life&quot; (York SYK 501), a single by the group Simplicity which included Bradford musician Roger Davis in its ranks.

<text>The three fairy-bluebirds are small passerine bird species found in forests and plantations in tropical southern Asia and the Philippines. They are the sole members of the genus Irena and family Irenidae, and are related to the ioras and leafbirds.

These are bulbul-like birds of open forest or thorn scrub, but whereas that group tends to be drab in colouration, fairy-bluebirds are sexually dimorphic, with the males being dark blue in plumage, and the females duller green.

These species eat fruit, especially figs, and possibly some insects. They lay two to three eggs in a tree nest.

The call of the Asian fairy-bluebird is a liquid two note &quot;Glue-It&quot;.

As the names would suggest, the Asian fairy-bluebird (&quot;I. puella&quot;) occurs across southern Asia, the Philippine fairy-bluebird (&quot;I. cyanogastra&quot;) in that archipelago, and the Palawan fairy-bluebird (&quot;I. tweeddalii&quot;) on the island of Palawan.

==Taxonomy==
The first scientists to examine fairy-bluebirds placed them in the genus &quot;Coracias&quot;, presumably on the strength of the iridescent blue plumage on the back. This was challenged in the 1820s by Thomas Horsfield and Coenraad Temminck, who suggested a relationship instead with the drongos. It was variously placed with the bulbuls and orioles as well. On the basis of the DNA-DNA hybridization studies of Sibley and Alhquist its closest relatives have now been identified as the leafbirds. This relationship was confirmed by a large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019 found that the family Irenidae was sister to the family Chloropseidae containing the leafbirds. The leafbirds are sometimes included in the family Irenidae with the fairy-bluebirds, but the time since the apparent divergence suggests that they are better treated as separate families.

==Morphology==
Fairy-bluebirds are robust birds that resemble Old World orioles in shape and size. Males are larger than females. They weigh between 50 and 100g, with some of that variation being caused by sexual differences and some by geographic variation. There are clines in size differences, which can be attributed to Bergmann&#x27;s rule, with the northernmost populations being larger on average. They have a powerful deep and notched bill used for crushing, with that of the Philippine species being largest. Their feet are small, which suggests that they spend less time climbing in order to feed and more time on the wing.

The plumage of the fairy-bluebirds is exceptional, with the upperparts being deep rich blue. The Asian fairy-bluebird is sexually dimorphic in its plumage, the male being much brighter than the female, but the Philippine fairy-bluebird exhibits much less difference and the female is almost as bright as the male. The deep colour is provided by specialised naked feather-tip barbs. Although the fairy-bluebirds are highly visible in sunlight, they are much less visible in the shade of the forest.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Asian fairy-bluebird has a discontinuous distribution from India to Java and Vietnam. In India the species is present in the southwest of the country and in the northeast. From Burma it has a continuous distribution (in suitable habitat) throughout most of Southeast Asia, and down into Borneo and Sumatra, as well as on the Andaman Islands. The species is rare in Sri Lanka. The Philippine fairy-bluebird is found on Luzon, Polillo, Leyte, Samar, Mindanao, Dinagat and Basilan. The Palawan fairy-bluebird is endemic to the island of Palawan.

The fairy-bluebirds are dependent upon fruit-producing forests, but all three species seem to exist in a wide range of forests, both evergreen and semi-evergreen. Within forests they are generally found in the canopy.

==Behaviour==

Pairs or small groups (individuals are seldom seen alone) of fairy-bluebirds forage widely to obtain food. Fruit, particularly figs in the genus &quot;Ficus&quot;, are the most important item in the diet of fairy-bluebirds. Fairy-bluebirds will generally eat fruit of a certain size, and will crush larger fruits in order to make them manageable. Most food is obtained in the canopy. In addition to fruit berries may be eaten, as well as nectar, although this behaviour has only been reported in birds in India. In contrast to adults, however, insects are the principal component of the diet of nestlings. In the Philippines birds have been observed following troops of macaques, possibly in order to collect flushed insects.

Male courtship displays include elaborate vocalizations, which the female responds to with nest building. Nests are constructed in trees or tall bushes from twigs, moss and grasses, and males and females cooperate in rearing chicks.

<text>ITV Tyne Tees, previously known as Tyne Tees, Channel 3 North East and Tyne Tees Television, is the ITV television franchisee for North East England and parts of North Yorkshire.

Tyne Tees launched on 15 January 1959 from studios at a converted warehouse in City Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, remaining in the city until July 2005 when Tyne Tees moved to smaller studios in Gateshead. Tyne Tees has contributed various programming to the ITV network and Channel 4, as well as its regional output. Some of Tyne Tees&#x27; best known programming includes the groundbreaking music show &quot;The Tube&quot;, critically acclaimed adaptations of Catherine Cookson novels, and children&#x27;s programmes such as &quot;Supergran&quot;.

The ownership and management structure of Tyne Tees has altered across its history, particularly in various mergers with Yorkshire Television. The two stations were managed by Trident Television during the 1970s, and the two stations merged again in 1992 to form Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. A series of takeovers and mergers across the ITV network, instigated by the large franchisees Granada and Carlton, led to Tyne Tees becoming part of ITV plc in 2004. The licence is currently held by ITV Broadcasting Ltd and the original Tyne Tees Television Ltd was dissolved on 28 March 2017.

The analogue signals in the Tyne Tees region were switched off in 2012, making the station, along with ITV London and UTV, one of the last ITV regions to become digital-only.

==History==
===Launch and the 1960s===
Independent television was introduced to Britain in September 1955. Initially only available in the London region, commercial television steadily became available in other regions. After a financially difficult time for the first ITV companies, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) decided to offer independent television to the rest of the country and advertised for bids. Several offers were submitted, including from the existing four companies, to the ITA. North East England was the last of the English regions without a television transmitter. Sir Richard Pease headed a local consortium that included film producer Sydney Box and &quot;News Chronicle&quot; executives George and Alfred Black. This consortium, was chosen from among eleven applicants because of its strong local links, commitment to local programming, concentrating on regional topical matters, and educational and children&#x27;s programmes. The contract was awarded on 12 December 1957. Experienced television executive Anthony Jelly was appointed as managing director, although historian Andrew Spicer credits the Black brothers as the driving force and public face of Tyne Tees; George was programme director, and both brothers were prominent board members. The company opened its first Newcastle office at Bradburn House on Northumberland Street, and it was from there, on 3 January 1958, the company directors issued 300,000 ordinary shares at fours shillings each.

Tyne Tees is named after two of the region&#x27;s three primary rivers. ITA considered the original name, &quot;North East England&quot;, was imprecise. Some of the consortium&#x27;s suggestions were rejected: &quot;Three Rivers Television&quot; for being obscure, and &quot;Tyne, Wear, and Tees&quot; for being too long. Eventually, in October 1958, the name &quot;Tyne Tees&quot; was announced. The other major river, the Wear (which runs between the Tyne and the Tees), was represented within Tyne Tees&#x27; early signature tune &quot;Three Rivers Fantasy&quot;.

The BBC transmitted their programmes from the Pontop Pike transmitting station in County Durham. The ITA built a new transmitter nearby at Burnhope, to cover an area from Alnwick to Northallerton, and west to Middleton-in-Teesdale. Television sets required a new aerial, the Yagi array, to receive the high frequency that the transmitter was using.

Tyne Tees went on air at 5 p.m. on 15 January 1959, three years after the first British independent television station, and the tenth such station to launch. The then-prime minister Harold Macmillan, who had been the Member of Parliament (MP) for the nearby Stockton-on-Tees for two decades, was interviewed live on the opening night. This was followed by a live variety show, named &quot;The Big Show&quot;, broadcast from a small studio. However, this local content was followed by an episode of the American police series &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; and an evening of entertainment programmes including &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;Double Your Money&quot;.
The full first night&#x27;s programming was

: 17:00 &quot;Three Rivers Fantasy&quot; – opening by the Duke of Northumberland.
: 17:02 &quot;Robin Hood&quot;
: 17:32 &quot;Popeye&quot;
: 17:45 &quot;ITN News&quot;
: 17:55 &quot;Local News&quot;
: 18:30 &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;
: 19:00 &quot;The Big Show&quot;, starring Dickie Henderson
: 20:00 &quot;Double Your Money&quot;
: 20:30 &quot;This Week&quot;
: 21:00 &quot;Wagon Train&quot;
: 22:00 &quot;ITN News&quot;
: 22:15 &quot;Murder Bag&quot;
: 22:45 &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;
: 23:15 &quot;Epilogue&quot; read by the Bishop of Durham

In the 2006 documentary &quot;A History of Tyneside&quot;, veteran North East newsreader Mike Neville suggested that the launch of Tyne Tees enabled local people to be able to hear local accents and dialects on television, since early broadcasters, particularly those from the BBC, tended to speak in Received Pronunciation. Scholar Natasha Vall suggests that the station&#x27;s commitment to broadcasting comedy helped establish a regional identity. George and Alfred Black had toured working men&#x27;s clubs looking for material for television. Local comic Bobby Thompson was invited to host a solo show. However, poor ratings and an unenthusiastic cast led to the show&#x27;s cancellation after barely a year.

Where most independent television companies published their schedules in the magazine &quot;TV Times&quot;, Tyne Tees produced their own listings magazine. &quot;The Viewer&quot; was published by News Chronicle, a company with connections to the station through the Black brothers. It was produced to satisfy &quot; &#x27;Tyne Tees&#x27; policy to be most regional of all the independent stations&quot;. Initially produced from an office in Forth Lane, near Newcastle station, it moved to the City Road studios when Dickens Press took over publication in 1963. The magazine became the biggest selling magazine in the region, with a circulation of 300,000 per week. New contracts issued by the ITA in 1968 stipulated that all ITV companies publish their listings in the &quot;TV Times&quot;, which became a national magazine with regional variations for the listings. After 498 editions, the last issues of &quot;The Viewer&quot; was published in September 1968.

The first advertisement screened on Tyne Tees was for Welch&#x27;s Toffee. The proprietor&#x27;s niece is Denise, who would become a well-known actress and personality. In 1959, Tyne Tees charged advertisers £100 for 15 seconds during prime time. The station launched a marketing campaign in the 1960s to sell advertising time named &#x27;Through Plan&#x27;. One of the range of promotional material was a poster called &#x27;Sweet Sixteen&#x27;, featuring photographs of 15 men accompanied by their full names, job titles and other formal history. The sole woman was simply referred to by her first name and her measurements. Historian Geoff Phillips comments that this &quot;was a profound statement of the culture of the time&quot;. Tyne Tees produced Advertising Magazines (admags), programmes with a loose storyline designed to advertise several products within an edition. Each 15-minute programme had about 12 product endorsements. Clients sat in the control room during rehearsals to ensure that their products were getting the exposure for which they had paid.

A committee was established in 1960 under the leadership of British industrialist Sir Harry Pilkington to consider the future of broadcasting. The 1962 Pilkington Report criticised ITV, and Tyne Tees in particular. Some companies, historian Simon Cherry notes, were scrambling &quot;very readily for the lowest common denominator ... Tyne Tees was notorious for avoiding minority programmes and putting out cop shows or westerns instead.&quot;

===1970s===
Following his report, Pilkington prompted the government to impose a levy on ITV&#x27;s revenue, the effects of which were heightened by a recession in 1970 when revenue had declined by 12 percent in real terms. Despite a reduction of the levy, Tyne Tees was one of the contractors facing collapse. To ensure Tyne Tees&#x27; survival, the ITA allowed it to affiliate with Yorkshire Television under a joint management company named &#x27;Trident Television&#x27;. The third &#x27;prong&#x27; of Trident was intended to be Anglia Television, but the IBA ruled out their involvement. Trident Television was formed in March 1969 as a joint venture to sell advertisements for Tyne Tees and Yorkshire. Yorkshire and Tyne Tees then came under Trident&#x27;s ownership on 1 January 1974. Peter Stanley Paine, Director of the broadcaster&#x27;s holding company Trident, was appointed managing director of Tyne Tees Television in 1974.

For the first time, one company owned two distinct and separate ITV franchises although the new company was dominated by the larger, stronger Yorkshire whose shareholders owned 71.5 percent of the new company. Trident had sales offices in London, where most agencies are located and where most advertising is bought and sold.

A major factor in the merger was that when UHF transmission was introduced in 1969 to accommodate colour television it was found that the key Bilsdale transmitting station in North Yorkshire so dominated the territories of both companies that its allotment to either individual company would have seriously prejudiced the coverage and sales revenue of the other. The ITA agreed that Tyne Tees and Yorkshire could be considered as one company for the purposes of selling airtime, while expressing their individual identities in their programming output.

A political scandal caused problems during one of Tyne Tees&#x27; franchise renewals. Producer Tony Sandford recalls that Lord Pilkington was sent by the ITA to question the station&#x27;s executives. One-time leader of Newcastle City Council T. Dan Smith had been convicted for accepting bribes concerning the redevelopment of Newcastle city centre. Pointing out that Smith became a director of the station, Pilkington asked why Tyne Tees failed to produce a documentary about a &quot;Newcastle&quot; politician, instead leaving it to &quot;Manchester&quot;-based Granada&#x27;s current affairs programme &quot;World in Action&quot;. By the late seventies, Tyne-Tees&#x27;s locally made programming amounted to an average of less than nine hours a week, with the remainder of programming from the ITV network. In 1978, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that a group called Northumbria Television, partially financed by local firms Bellway Holding and Swan Hunter, applied to the IBA to take over the franchise from the &quot;tired&quot; Tyne Tees for the two and a half years until the scheduled franchise renewal in 1981.

===1980s===

Yorkshire and Tyne Tees applied separately for renewal of the franchises in 1980, and each won. However, the two companies were required to demerge from January 1982 as a condition of the renewal of their ITV franchises. The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the successor to the ITA, recognised the criticism, reported &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;that Trident was London-dominated, overly diversified, and out of touch with the grass roots. It instructed Trident to set up both companies as independents and to retain only a minority shareholding in each.&quot; The IBA imposed the condition that for the 1980 franchise round a company could only own one franchise, although it could earn up to 30 percent of another. By November 1981, Trident had sold all but residual stakes in the two companies (15% and 20% respectively). When the new licences started in January 1982, Trident sold all but 30 percent of Yorkshire, and 25 percent of Tyne Tees.

During the 1980s, Tyne Tees began to develop separate services for the Northern and Southern halves of the region. From a small two-camera studio at Corporation House in the centre of Middlesbrough, Tyne Tees developed nightly opt-out news bulletins for Teesside, County Durham and North Yorkshire as part of the flagship magazine programme &quot;Northern Life&quot;. The company also pioneered non-news programming for the two sub-regions, including the nightly Epilogues, which ended a 29-year run in September 1988 when Tyne Tees commenced 24-hour broadcasting, although Tyne Tees had run an on-screen &quot;Jobfinder&quot; teletext service throughout the night since November 1987.

Meanwhile, developments in satellite and cable television, in addition to the two BBC channels and the new Channel 4, began to put pressure on ITV&#x27;s finances. ITV lost 3 percent of advertising between 1993 and 1994.

===1990s===

==== 1993 Franchise Round and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees merger ====
In 1990, Yorkshire bought Vaux Breweries&#x27; 19 percent stake in Tyne Tees, costing £5.1 million. In the same year, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher initiated a blind auction system, through the Broadcasting Act 1990, through which companies had to bid for the regional franchises. This system was to be used in the 1991 franchise round, which caused large changes to the network. Granada Television, the franchise holder for North West England, had long thought that the North of England should consolidate to &quot;counter the potential dominance of the south east&quot;. Tyne Tees outbid their main competition by £10 million; their main challenger was &#x27;North East Television&#x27;, which was backed by Granada, Border and local newspaper the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot;. Along with HTV and Yorkshire, Tyne Tees believed that they had to bid high to win. These companies bid so high that the Independent Television Commission seriously considered rejecting the business plans of each in turn and disqualifying them. However, they eventually decided in their favour. Together, the now-merged companies were committed to paying about £60 million a year to the government for the right to broadcast, a substantial amount compared to the £2,000 bid by Central, ITV&#x27;s largest station.

New regulations from the ITC allowed Yorkshire to merge with Tyne Tees, this time under the name Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc (YTT), although their ITV franchises remained separate. The merger allowed the companies to avoid collapse following their high franchise bids. This was the first step to ITV becoming one company in England and Wales. The merger led to the culling of staff. YTT&#x27;s two largest shareholders became Pearson and LWT. From 1 January 1993, Yorkshire and Tyne Tees broadcast all regional programmes simultaneously, affecting programming that had been shown at different paces in different regions (such as &quot;Blockbusters&quot; and the Australian soap operas &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; and &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;). Most of the regional programming was produced by Yorkshire and broadcast across the two stations, an area that the ITC considered too broad to be of local interest.

==== Broadcasting standards ====
The annual cost of the franchise began to take its toll on the company. At the end of 1993, the company revealed that it was heading for a pre-tax loss in the 1992–93 fiscal year instead of the expected profit. Chairman and chief executive Clive Leach was sacked as a consequence. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, YTT &quot;oversold its airtime to advertisers and failed to meet its ratings targets, resulting in a huge revenue shortfall estimated by analysts at over $20 million.&quot; The industry newspaper also reported that the company &quot;attempted to bolster its flagging 1992–93 revenues by giving advertisers deep discounts for advance airtime bookings made for the following year.&quot; Local MP Peter Mandelson wrote to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, David Mellor, in June 1992, saying &quot;Yorkshire and Tyne Tees are motivated by the interests of their shareholders, not their viewers, and need to make urgent savings ... it is quite clear that this is not so much a merger but a gobbling up of a smaller franchise held by a larger company.&quot;

Yorkshire-Tyne Tees were repeatedly warned over worsening standards at the Newcastle-based station and at one point the Independent Television Commission (the then-governing body of ITV) threatened to revoke the Tyne Tees licence if the situation did not improve. In 1993 the MP Ann Clwyd described Tyne Tees as having been &quot;stripped of any meaningful identity since its take over by Yorkshire TV&quot; and Ian Ritchie, Managing Director at Tyne Tees, left the company over a widely publicised disagreement with the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees board over what he saw as an unacceptable drive to centralise the company, including the complete closure of all non-news operations at Newcastle and a proposal to close the City Road studios. In October 1993, Yorkshire TV&#x27;s founder Ward Thomas was brought in to stabilise the situation at the company and quickly returned the company to profitability.

==== Bruce Gyngell appointed chair ====

Bruce Gyngell, the former chairman of breakfast station TV-am, became YTT&#x27;s managing director on 15 May 1995. On 16 March 1996, the presentation department in Newcastle was closed, and continuity was centralised in Leeds. (Transmission for the station had already been handled by Yorkshire since 1993). To halting &quot;a slide in viewing figures and reflecting confidence in the region&quot;, in September that year, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc rebranded its stations as &quot;Channel 3&quot;. The Broadcasting Act 1990 had made Channel 3 the &#x27;official&#x27; name for ITV, and &quot;3&quot; was the preset used by most television sets and videocassette recorders (VCRs) for ITV. However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network was decommissioned within three years. Promoting the new brand, Gygnell said, &quot;Everyone refers to this region as &#x27;the North-East&#x27; and we want it to be known that we are part of this great region and moving with it.&quot; Tyne Tees acquired the brand &quot;Channel 3 North East&quot;, with &#x27;Tyne Tees Television&#x27; still being retained as the company name.

==== Acquisition by Granada ====
On 26 June 1997, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc was acquired by the Granada Media Group plc (now ITV plc). The takeover concentrated ownership of the ITV network into three large groups: Granada, Carlton and United News &amp; Media.

The new guidelines, published by the ITC in 1998, about the Channel 3 licence renewals signalled substantial cuts in the companies&#x27; payments to the Treasury. Licences awarded in 1991 were due to expire in January 2001. However, companies, including Tyne Tees, which had bid high in 1991 were allowed to apply early to try to win financial relief. The new 10-year contract began in January 1999. In 1999, the cost of the tender fee that Tyne Tees was paying fell to £46 million, from the £70.5 million that it paid in 1998.

===2000s===

==== ITV centralisation ====
Days after the two largest companies in the network, Granada and Carlton, announced that they would merge, the regional names were withdrawn from networked programming in an &quot;attempt to make ITV1 more marketable nationally with a single generic brand.&quot; (Scottish, which does not trail any of the network shows under any ITV1 branding, Grampian, Ulster and Channel, each kept their own names but used their own versions of the new look.) Tyne Tees Television was rebranded as ITV1 Tyne Tees on 28 October 2002. The name &quot;Tyne Tees&quot; only appeared before regional programmes; the rest of the time, only the &quot;ITV1&quot; name was shown. The Tyne Tees logo continued to appear after its own programmes. Graeme Thompson was appointed MD and Controller of Programmes at ITV Tyne Tees in 2004, having been appointed Director of Broadcasting in December 1997 and then Controller of Programmes in 2001. He became Dean for Arts, Design and Media at the University of Sunderland in June 2009.

In 2004, Granada plc and Carlton Communications merged, creating a single company for all ITV franchises in England and Wales. Tyne Tees became part of ITV plc, the largest television production company in the world, which now owned 90 percent of ITV.

On 9 February 2005, Ofcom issued a proposed timetable for ending analogue terrestrial television transmissions as part of the switchover to digital television. Tyne Tees was the penultimate region to cease broadcasting in analogue, which occurred during September 2012. Tyne Tees took over the relay transmitter at Berwick-upon-Tweed in December 2006 from Border Television in order to extend the deadline of the town&#x27;s upgrade to digital TV by four years, since Border was the first to switch off its analogue signal in 2008.

In September 2007, Executive Chairman of ITV plc Michael Grade announced that as part of ITV&#x27;s five-year business strategy, Tyne Tees&#x27; newsroom would merge with Border Television. Politicians have expressed concern, however, that the merger would affect the quality of news for southern Scotland, in particular, would fail if it lost its customised bulletins. The changes would mean that aside from the merged Border-Tyne Tees regional news and political programmes, the station could broadcast only 25 minutes of dedicated North East news every weekday. In October 2008, the National Union of Journalists threatened industrial action if ITV tried to force any of the changes without discussion. Between December 2008 and February 2009, around 50 staff at the station were made redundant or accepted voluntary redundancy, including presenters, journalists and production staff. The new merged ITV Tyne Tees &amp; Border service launched on 25 February 2009.

====Bullying at Tyne Tees====
In March 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reported that there was bullying at Tyne Tees that lasted for six years. One manager was accused of using inappropriate language about people with disabilities, women reporters, Chinese people and Romani people. The manager was disciplined after one inquiry, but then more journalists complained about the same manager. The manager defended himself by claiming he was using black humour. He finally left the company with a pay-off of about £50,000. The original whistleblower left the company in 2006 and was paid £80,000 after threatening to take his case to an employment tribunal. Following this incident, ITV adopted an anti-bullying programme. An ITV spokesman advised that the total cost of the five bullying investigations was £1 million.

===2010s===
On 23 July 2013, proposals to reintroduce fully separate regional news services for the ITV Tyne Tees and ITV Border regions were approved by OFCOM. On 16 September 2013 both &quot;ITV News Tyne Tees&quot; and &quot;Lookaround&quot; were restored as two single 30-minute regional programmes on weekdays with separate shorter daytime and weekend bulletins reintroduced.

==Studios==

Tyne Tees&#x27;s original studios were located on City Road, Newcastle upon Tyne and were converted from two furniture warehouses purchased by the company. These new studios formed the basis of Tyne Tees operations and featured the company offices. The location was deliberately chosen because of its proximity to the telephone exchange in Carliol Square. Television signals were relayed by land-line from the studios to the switching centre; a distance between the studios and the exchange greater than would have significantly increased the cost of receiving the networked programmes from the other ITV stations.

The complex initially contained four studios, with a fifth built in 1981 to accommodate productions for Channel 4. Two nearby pubs, The Egypt Cottage and Rose &amp; Crown, became affectionately known as Studio 5 because of the amount of time that the station&#x27;s staff spent in them. Scottish and Newcastle Breweries offered to sell the adjacent The Egypt Cottage to the station when it was established, but Tyne Tees declined. However, the upstairs room was used as rehearsal space, and the pub would regularly feature in the &#x27;80s music show &quot;The Tube&quot;.

The complex continued until 2004 following the merger of Granada and Carlton to form ITV plc. As a result of the merger, ITV plc had (according to the company) an over-capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to save money, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. The decision was taken to close the City Road studios and relocate to a smaller purpose-built complex housing a newsroom and studio, resulting in the loss of up to 30 jobs. A documentary about the move to new premises, &quot;The Big Move&quot;, reflected that over the years the staff numbers had dropped by about 800, and around 170 people would be moving to the new site.

Tyne Tees moved to Television House at The Watermark, a new business park adjacent to the MetroCentre in Gateshead, in 2005. The first broadcast from their new base took place on 2 July 2005. Along with the move, news reporters had to learn a range of new skills, such as editing their own reports. The new practices contrasted with early reporting, which had an average crew of five. The new equipment required only a camera operator, who could also operate sound equipment, and a reporter. Television House also acts as a base for ITV SignPost, Britain&#x27;s biggest supplier of British Sign Language (BSL) services for television, video, CD-ROM, DVD, film and the Internet.

In 2010, the studios at City Road along with the neighbouring pub, the &quot;Egypt Cottage&quot;, were demolished with plans for a residential development on the site.

Tyne Tees also has smaller studios and offices in Billingham, York, London and within the Media Centre at the University of Sunderland.

==Sub-regions==
Tyne Tees operated two sub-regional news programmes from around 1983 until 2009, having been a commitment in the 1980 contract round. An opt-out was used from the main &quot;Northern Life&quot; bulletin was launched to provide localised news from each area. These two sub-opts were:
* Tyne Tees North – Broadcasting from the Pontop Pike and Chatton transmitters to viewers in Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. Bulletin presented by normal team from Newcastle Studio.
* Tyne Tees South – Broadcasting from the Bilsdale transmitter to viewers in County Durham, North Yorkshire and the Teesdale. During the 1980s and early &#x27;90s, this was a recorded segment (complete bulletins during weekday afternoons) presentation of which alternated between Newcastle and Middlesbrough studios (Tyne Tees was unable at the time to broadcast different content live to both transmitters simultaneously and so had to pre-record the southern opt even when presented from Middlesbrough). From 1993 to 1995 a completely separate broadcast &quot;Network North&quot; was produced from new studios in Billingham (this was intended by YTTTV to be broadcast on some YTV transmitters, and was advertised in the press as such, but in reality it went out on Tyne Tees only. Both local news programmes were renamed Tyne Tees News in 1996). From September 1996 a live 15-minute broadcast from Billingham was inserted into &quot;North East Tonight&quot;, which continued until 2005 when separate live programmes were produced from the Gateshead studios, before these ended in 2009. For nearly a decade during the 1990s and 2000s, the Billingham studios were used for the pan-regional late weekday bulletin, and for a time in the early 2000s Billingham was also used for a sub-regional version of &quot;North East Today&quot;, a daytime magazine programme.

As part of a cost saving initiative within ITV plc, Michael Grade announced in 2007 that the regional news service would be reduced from seventeen distinct news programmes and services to nine, affecting all the sub-regional services. As a result, all Tyne Tees sub-opts were ceased immediately. As part of the same plans, he also announced that Tyne Tees would be merged with Border Television, subject to Ofcom approval which occurred the following year, resulting in one large programme covering both regions. The two services were demerged in September 2013 and ITV News Tyne Tees and ITV Border once more began making their own 30 minute news programmes, although unlike other ITV regions which had offered sub-regional services, the Tyne Tees opt-out services were not reinstated at this time.

==Station identification==

The station identification, or idents for short, of Tyne Tees varied over time; however, most were based the letters TTTV arranged in a box format. The launch ident featured a white anchor which then gradually turned into three letter T&#x27;s alongside each other. This ident was accompanied by a shortened version of the station&#x27;s signature tune &quot;Three Rivers Fantasy&quot;, a specially commissioned work by composer and arranger Arthur Wilkinson. The musical overture merged several regional folk tunes, such as &quot;Water of Tyne&quot;, ending in The &quot;Blaydon Races&quot;. Part of the medley was based upon &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;.

The arrival of colour to ITV in 1969 led the companies to re-evaluate their on-screen identities. Tyne Tees replaced the triple-T logo in 1970 with the basic layout of two letter Ts above &#x27;TV&#x27;, an icon which would be incorporated into many future redesigns. Commentator Andrew Bowden observes that this interlinked design remains strongly associated with the company. The ident also introduced the blue and yellow colour scheme that would remain in use for many years. The dark blue was popular amongst ITV contractors because it closely approximated to black on a black and white television set. The version of the logo included the word &#x27;COLOUR&#x27;, boasting the new technology.

In 1979, the ident was modified once more to remove the word &#x27;colour&#x27; and to give it a more dynamic form up. The result was the yellow logo flying down onto a black background before the outline extended out towards the screen, set to a synthesised tune. The name &#x27;Tyne Tees&#x27; then flew in below and the background colour faded to blue.

The ident was again redesigned in 1988, in which the colour scheme was reversed and lighter shades of blue and yellow used. The form up was also altered to water flowing along sand, before the water divided into the Tyne Tees logo. The logo used computer animation for the first time.

However this bold new look was not to last, as Tyne Tees adopted the 1989 ITV generic look. The look consisted of the top left corner of the logo being inserted into the &#x27;V&#x27; segment of the ITV logo, with the station name placed underneath the Tyne Tees ITV logo. However, not every ITV station embraced the new logo, and Tyne Tees abandoned it in 1991.

The generic ident were replaced with ones produced by Tyne Tees, featuring a large reflective block which the viewpoint rotated around, before panning up to reveal it is the Tyne Tees logo. The music from the previous generic look was retained. Three variations were used, one with a black background, one with a multi coloured background and one with a grey background, with each version taking over from its predecessor after only a few months of use.

In 1992, Tyne Tees dropped their famous logo which they had previously been using since 1970 and opted instead for four separate letters stacked atop each other like previously accomplished spelling TTTV. The form up was over a grey background with a line moving across the screen, forming the letters as they went.

When Tyne Tees adopted the &quot;Channel 3 North East&quot; branding in September 1996, the traditional &quot;TTTV&quot; logo arrangement was dropped in favour of a large &#x27;3&#x27;, with the region written to the left of the &#x27;3&#x27;. The name &quot;Tyne Tees Television&quot; was only seen in small letters at the bottom of the screen, whereas Yorkshire, who also adopted the &quot;Channel 3&quot; brand a month later, was allowed to keep its &#x27;chevron&#x27; logo alongside the &#x27;3&#x27;. On-screen announcements said, &quot;This is Tyne Tees Television, broadcasting on Channel 3 in the North-East.&quot; The new branding was launched on 2 September 1996, with &quot;Going Home (The Theme of the Local Hero)&quot; by Mark Knopfler regularly accompanying ident sequences. Following Granada&#x27;s takeover in June 1997, the &quot;Channel 3 branding&quot; was scrapped in March 1998. As Bob Conlon, regional executive with the Independent Television Commission, said: &quot;People never really grasped the name – it didn&#x27;t exactly trip off the tongue and it was still referred to as Tyne Tees Television, because it has been there for years.&quot; All other regions in the network had retained their own identities rather than conforming to the generic &#x27;Channel 3&#x27; brand.

The &quot;TTTV&quot; logo returned to television screens in a new form, &quot;three-dimensional gold metallic lettering on a blue background&quot;, on 9 March 1998. This logo was more stylised than the 1992 equivalent and kept the music used throughout the &#x27;3&#x27; era. However, dual branding with the &quot;ITV&quot; name was introduced a year later, as part of the 1999 generic look. In this, the Tyne Tees logo was reduced to minuscule lettering in a blue box at the top of the screen, with emphasis being placed on the station name and ITV logo. However, this ident was supplemented by an ident to introduce local programming. This ident introduced on 4 September 2000 featured a new logo: a TTTV variant that was simplified to strictly vertical, horizontal or diagonal lines only. An arc of circles also adorned the top right corner. The ident itself featured pictures from the region. However, despite the new logo, the new logo wasn&#x27;t applied to the generic idents.

From 28 October 2002, all network programmes were introduced with a generic ITV1 ident. Regional programming used a generic ident with the name Tyne Tees below the ITV1 logo until November 2006, after which no regional idents existed. The Tyne Tees logo was last seen on production end boards until 2004, when they were replaced with, first an ITV logo, and then with an ITV Studios caption.

==Programming==
The station&#x27;s founding executives George and Alfred Black used their theatrical background to produce a lot of light entertainment programming on Tyne Tees in the early years. One of the best known was &quot;The One O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, a 40-minute variety show broadcast on weekdays. After 1,098 editions and more than five years on air, the final show was broadcast in March 1964. Some editions of &quot;The One O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; were produced by David Croft, who would go on to co-write many BBC situation comedies. For Tyne Tees, Croft also directed and produced the &quot;Ned&#x27;s Shed&quot; and &quot;Mary Goes to Market&quot; admags, as well as producing his first sitcom, &quot;Under New Management&quot;, set in a derelict pub in the North of England.

The bulk of Tyne Tees&#x27; output has been its regional programming, consisting of news, current affairs and local interest. Its longest running news programme was &quot;Northern Life&quot;, which ran from 1976 to 1992. The main news show has been rebranded several times; the current version is &quot;ITV News Tyne Tees&quot;. Until December 2008, local-interest programming was usually broadcast at 19:30 on Thursdays, which are low-profile slots due to the high-rating &quot;EastEnders&quot; being broadcast at those times on BBC One. Local non-news programming was also broadcast on early Sunday evenings and various late slots following &quot;News at Ten&quot; on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Such documentaries concentrate upon local history, landscape and architecture, such as the various shows by John Grundy. A monthly political programme, &quot;Around the House&quot;, continues to be produced for the Tyne Tees and Border regions.

Tyne Tees was obliged to contribute programming for the ITV network, although the bulk of network programming was purchased from the largest stations. Tyne Tees contributed game shows to the network, including &quot;Crosswits&quot; (1985–98) and &quot;Chain Letters&quot; (1987–97). Tyne Tees became a prolific producer of children&#x27;s entertainment for the ITV network in the 1970s and 1980s. From the late 1970s, it produced series such as &quot;The Paper Lads&quot;, &quot;Quest of Eagles&quot;, &quot;Barriers&quot; and &quot;Andy Robson&quot;. This continued into the 1980s with &quot;Madabout&quot;, &quot;How Dare You!&quot;, &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s Fridge&quot; and weekday pop-music show &quot;Razzamatazz&quot;, a pop programme that attracted many major recording artists to appear in a 17:15 slot. Tyne Tees also managed the production of &quot;Get Fresh&quot;, a Saturday morning show hosted in various weeks by different ITV regions. &quot;Super Gran&quot;, based on a series of books about a grandmother with superhuman powers, was also successful in the mid-1980s. Additionally they also dubbed the South African children&#x27;s series Oscar the Rabbit in Rubbidge which featured narration by Lance Percival.

With independent production company Festival Films and Television, Tyne Tees produced several adaptations of books by local novelist Catherine Cookson. The second dramatisation, &quot;The Black Velvet Gown&quot;, was the number one drama of 1991, winning an Emmy Award for best TV drama. Long-running soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was briefly produced at Tyne Tees&#x27; City Road studios in 1963 while all of the studios at the show&#x27;s home, Granada Television in Manchester, were occupied by a production of the opera &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;. However, not all of the station&#x27;s output has been successful. The 1997 soap opera &quot;Quayside&quot; was axed after 17 episodes after competing with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

Tyne Tees has also produced a wide range of music programming. One of the first attempts at reaching the teenage audience was &quot;Young at Heart&quot;, hosted by Jimmy Savile and Valerie Masters in 1960. In 1979, Tyne Tees launched two national series, &quot;Alright Now&quot; and &quot;Check it Out&quot;, the latter a mix of rock music and segments on youth-oriented social issues; among performances by established acts, the two shows offered early exposure to bands linked to the North East, notably Dire Straits and The Police.

The most famous music show from the station, though, derived its name from the studios themselves. Produced for Channel 4, and first broadcast three days after the new station&#x27;s launch in November 1982, &quot;The Tube&quot; acquired its name from the architecture of the public entrance to Studio 5, from where the show was broadcast, at the City Road complex. Under the direction of Gavin Taylor, &quot;The Tube&quot; filmed rock band Queen&#x27;s 1986 Wembley concert for later broadcast and video and DVD release. Cameras bearing the Tyne Tees logo can be seen throughout the concert. &quot;The Tube&quot; was dropped in 1987 as a result of falling audience figures and an incident involving Jools Holland, who cursed during a live trailer. A couple of months later, Tyne Tees launched another music show, this time for the ITV network. Whereas &quot;The Tube&quot; featured rock and punk bands and emerging musicians, Tyne Tees&#x27; &quot;The Roxy&quot;, concentrated on the mainstream UK singles chart. The show suffered, however, from not having a regular slot on the ITV network. Also, unlike &quot;The Tube&quot;, which had gained a loyal fanbase and respect from artists, mainstream acts were reluctant to travel to Newcastle for a three-minute performance when they could appear on the BBC&#x27;s more established &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the more accessible London.

<text>The leafbirds (Chloropseidae) are a family of small passerine bird species found in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. They were formerly grouped with the ioras and fairy-bluebirds in the family Irenidae. As presently defined, the leafbird family is monogeneric, with all species placed in the genus Chloropsis. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019 found that the family Chloropseidae is sister to the family Irenidae containing the fairy-bluebirds.

==Description==
The leafbirds range in size from , and in weight from . They resemble bulbuls, but whereas that group tends to be drab in colour, leafbirds are brightly plumaged, with the predominant green over the body giving rise to their common name. The family is mostly sexually dimorphic in their plumage, this can vary from the highly dimorphic orange-bellied leafbird to the Philippine leafbird, which exhibits no sexual dimorphism. Most of the differences between the sexes are in the extent of the other colours in the plumage, particularly in the colours around the head and the blue or black face mask, with females having less colour and a less extensive (or absent) mask. Some species have blue on the wings and tail. The plumage of juvenile birds is a duller version of the female&#x27;s. To human ears, their songs are melodious, and several species are good mimics. The calls include whistles and chatters.

Like bulbuls, leafbirds drop many body feathers when they are handled. This may confuse predators, especially snakes.

==Distribution and habitat==
Leafbirds are always found in trees and shrubs. Most are restricted to evergreen forests except the golden-fronted leafbird and Jerdon&#x27;s leafbird which live in deciduous monsoon forests, and the orange-bellied leafbird, which occurs in deciduous forests. Within this requirement, they occupy all broadleaf forest types in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The highest altitude they occur at is 2500 m (8200 feet). Some species, such as the blue-masked leafbird, have montane distributions, rarely descending below 1000 m.

The orange-bellied leafbird and the golden-fronted leafbird are amongst the more widespread species, with large ranges across mainland Asia. Some species have more restricted distributions, such as the yellow-throated leafbird, which is endemic to the Philippine island of Palawan, and the Bornean leafbird, restricted to northern Borneo. In general there are seldom more than three species occurring in the same area, although five species co-occur in the submontane forests of Sumatra. Co-occurring species are usually well-spaced on the spectrum of size, to reduce competition.

==Behaviour==

Leafbirds usually feed in the canopy, eating insects and some fruit and nectar. Prey is searched for by nimbly moving along the branch ends and gleaned. They are also capable of hover-gleaning to obtain prey, and will pursue flushed prey into the air or even as far as the forest floor. The extent to which the leafbirds consume nectar is a matter of some debate; records are more common in Southern Asia compared to South East Asia. Some species join mixed feeding flocks now and then; others defend the blooming and fruiting trees and bushes where they forage.

Unlike most tropical Asian passerines, the nests of leafbirds are not located low down in the forest, but are instead found on the ends of branches near the tree crown. As such the nests of many species have rarely, if ever, been seen. The nests are open cups; of the few known, they are built of fine stems, leaf parts and rootlets. Some hang from thin horizontal shoots of trees; in others the rim is attached to a pair of vertical twigs. Females lay 2 or 3 pinkish eggs. The only information for incubation times comes from captive birds, and incubation lasts around 14 days. Incubation is apparently performed only by the female, although in at least two species the male feeds the incubating females.

==Relationship with humans==
Leafbirds are attractive birds and, combined with an attractive song and capacity to mimic sounds, they have become very popular cagebirds. The majority of the trade in this family is confined to Asia. Some populations have been locally depleted by the massive numbers captured for the trade. Overall the eleven species are mostly still common in suitable habitat, although the amount of suitable habitat has declined greatly with deforestation. Over half of leafbird species are either threatened or near threatened. The greater green leafbird, the blue-winged leafbird and the Sumatran leafbird are endangered because of trapping for the cage bird trade. One species, the Philippine leafbird, is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss. The lesser green leafbird and the blue-masked leafbird are listed as near threatened.

<doc id="268094" wikidata="Q3347394" url="?curid=268094" title="O'Connor Airlines">
<text>O&#x27;Connor Airlines was an airline based in Mount Gambier, South Australia. It operated scheduled services from Mount Gambier to destinations in South Australia and Victoria. Its main base was Mount Gambier Airport, with a hub at Adelaide Airport, which serviced Mildura Airport and Port Augusta Airport. The airline also serviced Whyalla Airport until September 2007.

== History ==

The airline was established and started operations in 1973. Beginning as a one-aeroplane flight school in South Australia, O&#x27;Connor Airlines developed, over some years, into a freight and passenger service flying to 18 regional and country centres across the state. This was to change when it lost the freight contact. It subsequently relaunched itself, rebasing in Mount Gambier, and began services from that city to Adelaide and Melbourne. The IATA Code OL was used up to 1990. It then started flying to Whyalla. It began to service Mildura in 1998, purchasing a QantasLink route. In 2006, after Airlines of South Australia ceased operations, it began flying from Adelaide to Port Augusta.

The airline used Qantas facilities at both Adelaide and Melbourne airports. Originally, it used those of Australian Airlines.

In November 2007 O&#x27;Connor Airline was placed into voluntary administration with debts of between $4–5m AUD. This was largely blamed on high maintenance costs and high competition. Administrators McGrath Nicol was at the time looking for a buyer of the service.

O&#x27;Connor Airlines ceased operations on 14 December 2007 after its administrators were unable to find a buyer willing to purchase the airline as a going concern. On 21 February 2008, the airline&#x27;s creditors voted for a pooled Deed of Company Arrangement (DoCA) for the airline group to be broken up and then commence trading again under new ownership. Many of the assets were subsequently purchased by Mount Gambier businessman Adrian de Bruin, including the Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate, and used to establish de Bruin Air.

<doc id="268105" wikidata="Q614518" url="?curid=268105" title="Australasian treecreeper">
<text>There are seven species of Australasian treecreeper in the passerine bird family Climacteridae. They are medium-small, mostly brown birds with patterning on their underparts, and all are endemic to Australia-New Guinea. They resemble, but are not closely related to, the Holarctic treecreepers. The family is one of several families identified by DNA–DNA hybridisation studies to be part of the Australo-Papuan songbird radiation. There is some molecular support for suggesting that their closest relatives are the large lyrebirds.

As their name implies, treecreepers forage for insects and other small creatures living on and under the bark of trees, mostly eucalypts, though several species also hunt on the ground, through leaf-litter, and on fallen timber. Unlike the Holarctic treecreepers they do not use their tail for support when climbing tree trunks, only their feet.

Australasian treecreepers nest in holes in trees. The species in the family hold breeding territories, although the extent to which they are defended and last varies. Some species, such as the red-browed treecreeper and the brown treecreeper are cooperative breeders, others, like the white-throated treecreeper are not. The cooperative breeders form groups or a single breeding pair as well as up to three helpers, which are usually the young males of previous pairings. Helpers assist with the construction of the nest, feeding of the incubating female and feeding and defending the young.

==Description==
The Australasian treecreepers are small oscine songbirds, measuring in length and weighing . They have relatively long tails, short legs with strong feet, stout bodies and longish and slightly down-curved bills. The plumage of this family is dull, trending towards brown, reddish-brown or greyish brown above and paler below. There is usually some sexual dimorphism in plumage, with females having some reddish colour in the head or breast that is absent in the males. Other differences between the sexes are common, and can arise very early in the life of these birds, being present even in late-stage nestlings. They are poor fliers, with their flight described as undulating and gliding.

==Distribution and habitat==
All the Australian treecreepers are endemic to Australia except for one species restricted to New Guinea. They are found across much of Australia except for the large island of Tasmania, possibly because they are poor fliers and unable to disperse across water barriers, or possibly because of a lack of bark-dwelling invertebrates to feed on.

Across their global distribution they occupy a wide range of habitats. The Papuan treecreeper is found in mid-montane to montane forested habitats on New Guinea, from . The white-browed treecreeper inhabits acacia and &quot;Casuarina&quot; woodlands in deserts in southern Australia. Other species inhabit subtropical rainforest, eucalypt woodlands and southern beech forests. The brown treecreeper is semi-terrestrial and can live in more open woodland habitats, but is still sensitive to the loss of its habitat. The Australasian treecreepers are essentially non-migratory, although there are distinct differences in the dispersal of young birds after fledging, especially between the two genera.

==Behaviour==
===Diet and feeding===
The Australasian treecreepers principally forage for arthropods found on the bark of trees, but they will also take prey from the ground and will eat tree sap and nectar from flowers. They commonly obtain insect prey by gleaning from surface of bark, but will also probe into holes and pull at loose strips of bark and flick underneath it with their quadrifid tongue.

=== Breeding ===
The breeding season lasts from June into January, the birds lay 2-3 eggs per clutch with an incubation time of 17 days. Nests are built by both male and female with soft materials like grass and feathers. The treecreeper will often get helper birds to feed chicks or contribute to the nest.

<doc id="268107" wikidata="Q1062596" url="?curid=268107" title="Luyten's Star">
<text>Luyten&#x27;s Star (GJ 273) is a red dwarf in the constellation Canis Minor located at a distance of from the Sun. It has a visual magnitude of 9.9, making it too faint to be viewed with the unaided eye. It is named after Willem Jacob Luyten, who, in collaboration with Edwin G. Ebbighausen, first determined its high proper motion in 1935. The star has two confirmed planets and two candidate planets, of which Luyten b is in the circumstellar habitable zone.

==Properties==
This star is approximately a quarter the mass of the Sun and has 35% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. Luyten&#x27;s Star is at the maximum mass at which a red dwarf can be fully convective, which means that most if not all of the star forms an extended convection zone. It has a stellar classification of M3.5V, with the V luminosity class indicating this is a main-sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The projected rotation rate of this star is too low to be measured, but can be no greater than 1 km/s. Measurements of periodic variation in surface activity suggest a leisurely rotation period of roughly 116 days (which would give a velocity of ~0.15 km/s). The effective temperature of the star&#x27;s outer envelope is a relatively cool 3,150 K, giving the star the characteristic red-orange hue of an M-type star.

At present, Luyten&#x27;s Star is moving away from the Solar System. The closest approach occurred about 13,000 years ago when it came within 3.67 parsecs. The star is currently located 1.2 light years distant from Procyon, which would appear as a visual magnitude −4.5 star in the night sky of Luyten&#x27;s Star&#x27;s planets. However, Luyten&#x27;s Star would only have an apparent magnitude of 4.6 from Procyon&#x27;s sky because it is much less luminous. The closest encounter between the two stars occurred about 600 years ago when Luyten&#x27;s Star was at its minimal distance of about 1.12 ly from Procyon. The space velocity components of Luyten&#x27;s Star are U = +16, V = −66 and W = −17 km/s.

==Planetary system==



In March 2017, two candidate planets were discovered orbiting Luyten&#x27;s Star. The outer planet, GJ 273b, is a super-Earth in its star&#x27;s optimistic habitable zone. It has a minimum mass of and orbits at a distance of completing one orbital period in While the planet is on the innermost edge of the star&#x27;s conservative habitable zone, the incident flux is only 1.06 , so it may be potentially habitable if water and an atmosphere are present; depending on albedo, its equilibrium temperature could be anywhere between 206 and 293 Kelvin. The inner planet, GJ 273c, is one of the lightest exoplanets detected by radial velocities, with a mass of only However, it orbits much further in, with an orbital period of only 

GJ 273b is one of the closest known planets in its star&#x27;s habitable zone.

Both planets are near 4:1 resonance; it is possible that, with still undiscovered ones, the entire inner part of this system is trapped in a single simple-mean-motion resonance chain like TRAPPIST-1.

In 2019, two more candidate planets were detected by radial velocity, making a potential total of four known planets in the system. If all four planets are present, their true masses must be close to their minimum masses for the system to be stable, with upper limits of for b, for c, for d, and for e.

In October 2017, &quot;Sónar Calling GJ273b&quot;, a project by METI and the Sónar music festival in Barcelona, Spain transmitted a series of radio signals towards Luyten&#x27;s star from a radar antenna at Ramfjordmoen, Norway. The signal consisted of a scientific and mathematical tutorial on how to decode the messages and was accompanied by 33 encoded musical compositions by various musicians. A second signal series was transmitted in May 2018. Were anyone listening, the soonest response would be received by 2042.

<text>The Cuban Revolution () was the military and political overthrow of Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s dictatorship, which had reigned as the government of Cuba between 1952 and 1959. The revolution began after the 1952 Cuban coup d&#x27;état, which saw Batista topple the nascent Cuban democracy and consolidate power. Among those opposing the coup was Fidel Castro, then a novice attorney who attempted to contest the coup through Cuba&#x27;s judiciary. Once these efforts proved fruitless, Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl led an armed attack on the Cuban military&#x27;s Moncada Barracks on 26 July 1953.

Following the attack&#x27;s failure, Fidel Castro and his co-conspirators were arrested and formed the 26th of July Movement (M-26-7) in detention. At his trial, Fidel Castro launched into a two-hour speech that won him national fame as he laid out his grievances against the Batista dictatorship. In an attempt to win public approval, Batista granted amnesty to the surviving Moncada Barracks attackers and the Castros fled into exile. During their exile, the Castros consolidated their strategy in Mexico and subsequently reentered Cuba in 1956, accompanied by Che Guevara, whom they had encountered during their time in Mexico.

Returning to Cuba aboard the &quot;Granma&quot;, the Castros, Guevara, and other supporters encountered gunfire from Batista&#x27;s troops. The rebels fled to the Sierra Maestra where the M-26-7 rebel forces would reorganize, conducting urban sabotage and covert recruitment. Over time the Popular Socialist Party, once the largest and most powerful organizations opposing Batista, would see its influence and power wane in favor of the 26th of July Movement. As the irregular war against Batista escalated, the rebel forces transformed from crude, guerrilla fighters into a cohesive fighting force that could confront Batista&#x27;s army in military engagements. By the time the rebels were able to oust Batista, the revolution was being driven by a coalition between the Popular Socialist Party, the 26th of July Movement and the Revolutionary Directorate of 13 March.

The rebels, led by the 26th of July Movement, finally toppled Batista on 31 December 1958, after which he fled the country. Batista&#x27;s government was dismantled as Castro became the most prominent leader of the revolutionary forces. Soon thereafter, the 26th of July Movement established itself as the de facto government. Although Castro was immensely popular in the period immediately following Batista&#x27;s ouster, he quickly consolidated power, leading to domestic and international tensions. 26 July 1953 is celebrated in Cuba as (from Spanish: &quot;Day of the Revolution&quot;). The 26th of July Movement later reformed along Marxist–Leninist lines, becoming the Communist Party of Cuba in October 1965.

The Cuban Revolution had significant domestic and international repercussions, particularly with regard to Cuba–United States relations, which were severely damaged and remain strained despite attempts at reconciliation, such as the Cuban thaw in the 2010s and 2020s. In the revolution&#x27;s aftermath, Castro&#x27;s government initiated a program of nationalization, centralized the press, and consolidated political power, which transformed Cuba’s economy and civil society, alienating both segments of the Cuban population and the United States. Castro&#x27;s authoritarianism, combined with economic challenges, contributed to the Cuban Exodus, with many fleeing to the United States. The revolution also marked the beginning of Cuba&#x27;s interventions in foreign conflicts, including in Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia and the Middle East. Several rebellions, mainly in the Escambray Mountains, occurred between 1959 and 1965, and were suppressed by the revolutionary government.

==Background==

===Corruption in Cuba===

The Republic of Cuba at the turn of the 20th century was largely characterized by a deeply ingrained tradition of corruption where political participation resulted in opportunities for elites to engage in wealth accumulation. Cuba&#x27;s first presidential period under Don Tomás Estrada Palma from 1902 to 1906 was considered to uphold the best standards of administrative integrity in the history of the Republic of Cuba. However, a United States intervention in 1906 resulted in Charles Edward Magoon, an American diplomat, taking over the government until 1909. Although Magoon&#x27;s government did not condone corrupt practices, there is debate as to how much was done to stop what was widespread especially with the surge of American money coming into the small country. Hugh Thomas suggests that while Magoon disapproved of corrupt practices, corruption still persisted under his administration and he undermined the autonomy of the judiciary and their court decisions. On 29 January 1909, the sovereign government of Cuba was restored, and José Miguel Gómez became president. No explicit evidence of Magoon&#x27;s corruption ever surfaced, but his parting gesture of issuing lucrative Cuban contracts to U.S. firms was a continued point of contention. Cuba&#x27;s subsequent president, José Miguel Gómez, was the first to become involved in pervasive corruption and government corruption scandals. These scandals involved bribes that were allegedly paid to Cuban officials and legislators under a contract to search the Havana harbour, as well as the payment of fees to government associates and high-level officials. Gómez&#x27;s successor, Mario García Menocal, wanted to put an end to the corruption scandals and claimed to be committed to administrative integrity as he ran on a slogan of &quot;honesty, peace and work&quot;. Despite his intentions, corruption actually intensified under his government from 1913 to 1921. Instances of fraud became more common while private actors and contractors frequently colluded with public officials and legislators. Charles Edward Chapman attributes the increase of corruption to the sugar boom that occurred in Cuba under the Menocal administration. Furthermore, the advent of World War One enabled the Cuban government to manipulate sugar prices, the sales of exports and import permits. While in office, García Menocal hosted his college fraternity, in the 1920 Delta Kappa Epsilon National Convention, the first international fraternity conference outside the US, which took place in Cuba. He was responsible for creating the Cuban Peso; until his presidency Cuba used both the Spanish Real and US Dollar. President Menocal left the Cuban national treasury in overdraft and therefore in precarious financial situation. Menocal supposedly spent $800 million during his 8 years in office and left a floating debt of $40 million.

Alfredo Zayas succeeded Menocal from 1921 to 1925 and engaged in what Calixto Masó refers to as the &quot;maximum expression of administrative corruption&quot;. Both petty and grand corruption spread to nearly all aspects of public life and the Cuban administration became largely characterized by nepotism as Zayas relied on friends and relatives to illegally gain greater access to wealth. Gerardo Machado succeeded Zayas from 1925 to 1933, and entered the presidency with widespread popularity and support from the major political parties. However, his support declined over time. Due to Zayas&#x27; previous policies, Gerardo Machado aimed to diminish corruption and improve the public sector&#x27;s performance through an &quot;honest administration&quot;, which had been referred to as &quot;moralización&quot;, from 1925 to 1933. While he was successfully able to reduce the amounts of low level and petty corruption, grand corruption still largely persisted. Machado embarked on development projects that enabled the persistence of grand corruption through inflated costs and the creation of &quot;large margins&quot; that enabled public officials to appropriate money illegally. Under his government, opportunities for corruption became concentrated into fewer hands with &quot;centralized government purchasing procedures&quot; and the collection of bribes among a smaller number of bureaucrats and administrators. Through the development of real estate infrastructures and the growth of Cuba&#x27;s tourism industry, Machado&#x27;s administration was able to use insider information to profit from private sector business deals. Many people objected to his running again for re-election in 1928, as his victory violated his promise to serve for only one term. As protests and rebellions became more strident, his administration curtailed free speech and used repressive police tactics against opponents. Machado unleashed a wave of violence against his critics, and there were numerous murders and assassinations committed by the police and army under Machado&#x27;s administration. The extent of his involvement in these is disputed, though Russell Porter makes the claim that Machado confessed to being involved. Though the extent of Machado&#x27;s participation in such violent acts is unknown, he has since been described as a dictator. In May 1933, Machado was forced out as newly appointed US ambassador Sumner Welles arrived in Cuba and initiated negotiation with the opposition groups for a government to succeed Machado&#x27;s. A provisional government headed by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada (son of Cuban independence hero Carlos Manuel de Céspedes) and including members of the ABC was brokered; it took power on 12 August 1933 amidst a general strike in Havana.

Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada subsequently was offered the position of President by ambassador Sumner Welles. He took office on 12 August 1933, and Welles proposed that &quot;general elections may be held approximately 3 months from now so that Cuba may once more have a constitutional government in the real sense of the word.&quot; Céspedes agreed, and declared that a general election would be held on 24 February 1934, for a new presidential term to begin on 20 May 1934. However, on 4-5 September 1933, the Sergeants&#x27; Revolt took place while Céspedes was in Matanzas and Santa Clara after a hurricane had ravaged those regions. The junta of officers led by Sergeant Fulgencio Batista and students proclaimed that it had taken power in order to fulfill the aims of the revolution; it briefly described a program which included economic restructuring, punishment of wrongdoers, recognition of public debts, creation of courts, political reorganization, and any other actions necessary to construct a new Cuba based on justice and democracy. Only five days after the coup, Batista and the Student Directory promoted Ramón Grau to the role of President. The ensuing One Hundred Days Government issued a number of reformist declarations but never gained diplomatic recognition from the US; it was overthrown in January 1934 under pressure from Batista and the US ambassador. Grau was replaced by Carlos Mendieta, and within five days the U.S. recognized Cuba&#x27;s new government. The corruption was not curtailed under Mendieta and he resigned in 1935 after unrest continued, and their followed a number of interim and weak presidents under the guidance of Batista and the US. Batista, supported by the Democratic Socialist Coalition which included Julio Antonio Mella&#x27;s Communist Party, defeated Grau in the first presidential election under the new Cuban constitution in the 1940 election, and served a four-year term as President of Cuba. Batista was endorsed by the original Communist Party of Cuba (later known as the Popular Socialist Party), which at the time had little significance and no probability of an electoral victory. This support was primarily due to Batista&#x27;s labor laws and his support for labor unions, with which the Communists had close ties. In fact, Communists attacked the anti-Batista opposition, saying Grau and others were &quot;fascists&quot; and &quot;reactionaries&quot;.

Senator Eduardo Chibás dedicated himself to exposing corruption in the Cuban government, and formed the Partido Ortodoxo in 1947 to further this aim. Argote-Freyre points out that Cuba&#x27;s population under the Republic had a high tolerance for corruption. Furthermore, Cubans knew and criticized who was corrupt, but admired them for their ability to act as &quot;criminals with impunity&quot;. Corrupt officials went beyond members of congress to also include military officials who granted favours to residents and accepted bribes. The establishment of an illegal gambling network within the military enabled army personnel such as Lieutenant Colonel Pedraza and Major Mariné to engage in extensive illegal gambling activities. Mauricio Augusto Font and Alfonso Quiroz, authors of &quot;The Cuban Republic and José Martí&quot;, say that corruption &quot;pervaded in political life&quot; under the administrations of Presidents Ramón Grau and Carlos Prío Socarrás. Prío was reported to have stolen over $90 million in public funds, which was equivalent to one fourth of the annual national budget. Prior to the Communist revolution, Cuba was ruled under the elected government of Fulgencio Batista from 1940 to 1944. Throughout this time period, Batista&#x27;s support base consisted mainly of corrupt politicians and military officials. Batista himself was able to heavily profit from the regime before coming into power through inflated government contracts and gambling proceeds. In 1942, the British Foreign Office reported that the U.S. State Department was &quot;very worried&quot; about corruption under President Fulgencio Batista, describing the problem as &quot;endemic&quot; and exceeding &quot;anything which had gone on previously&quot;. British diplomats believed that corruption was rooted within Cuba&#x27;s most powerful institutions, with the highest individuals in government and military being heavily involved in gambling and the drug trade. In terms of civil society, Eduardo Saenz Rovner writes that corruption within the police and government enabled the expansion of criminal organizations in Cuba. Batista refused U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s offer to send experts to help reform the Cuban Civil Service. Batista didn&#x27;t run in the 1944 election, and Partido Auténtico party member Ramón Grau was elected president, and oversaw extensive corruption during his administration. He had Carlos Prío Socarrás serve turns as Minister of Public Works, Minister of Labor and Prime Minister. On the next election 1 July 1948, Prio was elected president of Cuba as a member of the Partido Auténtico which presided over corruption and irresponsible government of this period. Prío was assisted by Chief of the Armed Forces General Genobebo Pérez Dámera and Colonel José Luis Chinea Cardenas, who had previously been in charge of the Province of Santa Clara.

The eight years under Grau and Prío, were marked by violence among political factions and reports of theft and self-enrichment in the government ranks. The Prío administration increasingly came to be perceived by the public as ineffectual in the face of violence and corruption, much as the Grau administration before it.

With elections scheduled for the middle of 1952, rumors surfaced of a planned military coup by long-shot presidential contender Fulgencio Batista. Prío, seeing no constitutional basis to act, did not do so. The rumors proved to be true. On 10 March 1952, Batista and his collaborators seized military and police commands throughout the country and occupied major radio and TV stations. Batista assumed power when Prío, failing to mount a resistance, boarded a plane and went into exile.

Batista, after his military coup against Prío Socarras, again took power and ruled until 1959. Under his rule, Batista led a corrupt dictatorship that involved close links with organized crime organizations and the reduction of civil freedoms of Cubans. This period resulted in Batista engaging in more &quot;sophisticated practices of corruption&quot; at both the administrative and civil society levels. Batista and his administration engaged in profiteering from the lottery as well as illegal gambling. Corruption further flourished in civil society through increasing amounts of police corruption, censorship of the press as well as media, and creating anti-communist campaigns that suppressed opposition with violence, torture and public executions. The former culture of toleration and acceptance towards corruption also dissolved with the dictatorship of Batista. For instance, a Cuban student stated, &quot;however corrupt Grau and Prío were, we elected them and therefore allowed them to steal from us. Batista robs us without our permission.&quot; Corruption under Batista further expanded into the economic sector with alliances that he forged with foreign investors and the prevalence of illegal casinos and criminal organizations in the country&#x27;s capital of Havana.

===Batista regime===

In the decades following the United States&#x27; invasion of Cuba in 1898, and formal independence from the U.S. on 20 May 1902, Cuba experienced a period of significant instability, enduring a number of revolts, coups and a period of U.S. military occupation. Batista became president for the second time in 1952, after seizing power in a military coup and canceling the 1952 elections. Although Batista had been relatively progressive during his first term, in the 1950s he proved far more dictatorial and indifferent to popular concerns. While Cuba remained plagued by high unemployment and limited water infrastructure, Batista antagonized the population by forming lucrative links to organized crime and allowing American companies to dominate the Cuban economy, especially sugar-cane plantations and other local resources. Although the US armed and politically supported the Batista dictatorship, later US president John F. Kennedy recognized its corruption and the justifiability of removing it.

During his first term as president, Batista was supported by the original Communist Party of Cuba (later known as the Popular Socialist Party), but during his second term he became strongly anti-communist. In the months following the March 10, 1952 coup d&#x27;état, Fidel Castro, then a young lawyer and activist, put into motion a lawsuit against Batista, whom he accused of corruption and tyranny. However, Castro&#x27;s constitutional arguments were rejected by the Cuban courts, as the coup was perceived as being a &quot;de facto, revolutionary overturn of the constitution&quot;. After deciding that the Cuban regime could not be replaced through legal means, Castro resolved to launch an armed revolution. To this end, he and his brother Raúl founded a paramilitary organization known as &quot;The Movement&quot;, stockpiling weapons and recruiting around 1,200 followers from Havana&#x27;s disgruntled working class by the end of 1952.

==History==

===Early stages: 1953–1961===

==== Plan to attack Camp Columbia ====
Rafael García Bárcena, a professor of philosophy, founded the National Revolutionary Movement (&quot;Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario&quot; – MNR), consisting largely of middle-class members. In March 1953, the MNR had planned to attack and seize control of the barracks at Camp Colombia, but police had been alerted to the plot, with the conspirators being rounded up and tortured. In all, fourteen people were sentenced to imprisonment for the attack plot.

==== Attack on the Moncada Barracks ====
Striking their first blow against the Batista government, Fidel and Raúl Castro gathered an upwards of 126 fighters and planned a multi-pronged attack on several military installations. On 26 July 1953, the rebels attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago and the barracks in Bayamo only to be decisively defeated by the far more numerous government soldiers following a call to withdraw when Fidel Castro realized a lack of adequate knowledge about the barracks, as well as the lack of weapon experience amongst the recruited fighters, would ultimately lead to failure. It was hoped that the staged attack would spark a nationwide revolt against Batista&#x27;s government. After an hour of fighting most of the rebels and their leader fled to the mountains. The exact number of rebels killed is debatable; however, in his autobiography, Fidel Castro claimed that five were killed in the midst of battle, and an additional fifty-six were executed after being captured by the Batista government. Due to the government&#x27;s large number of men, Hunt revised the number to be around 60 members taking the opportunity to flee to the mountains along with Castro. Among the dead was Abel Santamaría, Castro&#x27;s second-in-command, who was imprisoned, tortured, and executed on the same day as the attack.

=== Imprisonment and immigration ===
Numerous key Movement revolutionaries, including the Castro brothers, were captured shortly afterwards. In a highly political trial, Fidel spoke for nearly four hours in his defense, ending with the words &quot;Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me.&quot; Castro&#x27;s defense was based on nationalism, the representation and beneficial programs for the non-elite Cubans, and his patriotism and justice for the Cuban community. In October 1953, Fidel was sentenced to fifteen years in the Presidio Modelo prison, located on Isla de Pinos, while Raúl was sentenced to thirteen years. However, on 15 May 1955, under broad political pressure, the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba, including the Moncada attackers. Fidel&#x27;s Jesuit childhood teachers succeeded in persuading Batista to include Fidel and Raúl in the release.

Soon, the Castro brothers joined with other exiles in Mexico to prepare for the overthrow of Batista, receiving training from Alberto Bayo, a leader of Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. On 12 June 1955, the revolutionaries named themselves the &quot;26th of July Movement&quot;, in reference to the date of their attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. A month later, in July, Fidel met the Argentine revolutionary Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara in Mexico, the latter joining his cause. Raúl and Fidel&#x27;s chief advisor Ernesto aided the initiation of Batista&#x27;s amnesty.

==== Student demonstrations ====
By late 1955, student riots and demonstrations became more common, and unemployment became problematic as new graduates could not find jobs. These protests were dealt with increasing repression. All young people were seen as possible revolutionaries. Due to its continued opposition to the Cuban government and much protest activity taking place on its campus, the University of Havana was temporarily closed on 30 November 1956 (it did not reopen until 1959 under the first revolutionary government).

====Attack on the Domingo Goicuria Barracks====
While the Castro brothers and the other 26 July Movement guerrillas were training in Mexico and preparing for their amphibious deployment to Cuba, another revolutionary group followed the example of the Moncada Barracks assault. On 29 April 1956, an Auténtico guerrilla group comprising upwards of thirty rebels, brought together by Reynold García, attacked the Domingo Goicuría Barracks in the Matanzas province. A total of fifteen rebels died, with five killed during battle and the remaining ten captured and executed. At least one rebel had been executed by Pilar García, Batista&#x27;s garrison commander. Florida International University historian Miguel A. Bretos was in the nearby cathedral when the firefight began. In his 2011 biography, titled &quot;Matanzas: The Cuba Nobody Knows&quot;&#x27;, he wrote: &quot;That day the Cuban Revolution began for me and Matanzas.&quot;

===Insurgency: 1956–1957===
==== &quot;Granma&quot; landing ====
The yacht &quot;Granma&quot; departed from Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico, on 25 November 1956, carrying the Castro brothers and eighty others, even though the yacht was designed to accommodate twelve people with a maximum of twenty-five. The yacht landed in Playa Las Coloradas on 2 December, in the southern municipality of Niquero, arriving two days later than planned because the boat was heavily loaded, unlike during the practice sailing runs. This dashed any hopes for a coordinated attack with the &quot;llano&quot; wing of the Movement. After arriving and exiting the ship, the band of rebels began to make their way into the Sierra Maestra mountains, a range in southeastern Cuba. Three days after the trek began, Batista&#x27;s army attacked and killed most of the &quot;Granma&quot; participants – while the exact number is disputed, no more than twenty of the original eighty-two men survived the initial encounters with the Cuban army and escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains.

The group of survivors included Fidel and Raúl Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. The dispersed survivors, alone or in small groups, wandered through the mountains, looking for each other. Eventually, the men would link up again – with the help of peasant sympathizers – and would form the core leadership of the guerrilla army. A number of female revolutionaries, including Celia Sánchez and Haydée Santamaría (the sister of Abel Santamaría), also assisted Fidel Castro&#x27;s operations in the mountains.

====The Battle of La Plata====
On 17 January 1957, the 26th of July Movement engaged in armed combat with Cuba&#x27;s small army garrison stationed in barracks in La Plata, a village in the Sierra Maestra mountain. The battle began at 2:40 am, initiated by Fidel who shot the first two bullets. There had been a brief moment of urgency on the rebels&#x27; end, as the army garrison had been pushing forward in an unexpectedly relentless manner, whilst the rebels&#x27; explosives were not detonating when thrown. Subsequently, Guevara and Luis Crespo closed in on the barracks and the latter set it on fire, helping ward off the soldiers and shoot those who were in the line of fire. It was not long before the Cuban army garrison surrendered. In the end, the rebels were uninjured. In contrast, two Cuban soldiers died in the midst of battle, five were wounded, and three were taken as prisoners (they ultimately succumbed to their injuries); only some were able to escape. Only one of the surviving Cuban army soldiers worked under the command of Raúl following the battle, eventually being promoted to lieutenant.

The 26th of July Movement&#x27;s success in this battle marked the first major victory the rebels. In addition, the men took advantage of the available loot left behind by the opposing party: nine weapons were taken, an abundance of ammo, clothes, food, and fuel.

==== Presidential palace attack ====


At approximately 3:21 pm on 13 March 1957 the student opposition group Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo stormed the Presidential Palace in Havana, attempting to assassinate Batista and overthrow the government. The attack ended in utter failure. The DR&#x27;s leader, student José Antonio Echeverría, died in a shootout with Batista&#x27;s forces at the Havana radio station he had seized to spread the news of Batista&#x27;s anticipated death. The handful of survivors included Dr. Humberto Castelló Aldanás (who later became the Inspector General in the Escambray), Rolando Cubela Secades and Faure Chomón (both later Comandantes of the 13 March Movement, centered in the Escambray Mountains of Las Villas Province).

The plan, as explained by Faure Chaumón, was to attack the Presidential Palace and occupy the radio station Radio Reloj at the Radiocentro CMQ Building in order to announce the death of Batista and call for a general strike. The Presidential Palace was to be captured by fifty men under the direction of :es:s:Carlos Gutiérrez Menoyo (brother of Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo) and Faure Chaumón, with support from a group of 100 armed men occupying the tallest buildings in the surrounding area of the Presidential Palace (La Tabacalera, the Sevilla Hotel, the Palace of Fine Arts). However this secondary support operation was not carried out, as the men failed to arrive at the scene due to last-minute hesitation. Although the attackers reached the third floor of the palace, they did not locate or execute Batista.

====Humboldt 7 massacre====


The Humboldt 7 massacre occurred on 20 April 1957 at apartment 201 of the Humboldt 7 residential building when the National Police led by Lt. Colonel Esteban Ventura Novo assassinated four participants who had survived the assault on the Presidential Palace and in the seizure of the Radio Reloj station at the Radiocentro CMQ Building.

Juan Pedro Carbó was sought by police for the assassination of Col. Antonio Blanco Rico, Chief of Batista&#x27;s secret service. Marcos &quot;Marquitos&quot; Rodríguez Alfonso began arguing with Fructuoso, Carbó and Machadito; Joe Westbrook had not yet arrived. Marquitos, who gave the airs to be a revolutionary, was strongly against the revolution and was thus resented by the others. On the morning of 20 April 1957, Marquitos met with lieutenant colonel Esteban Ventura Novo and revealed the location of where the young revolutionaries were, Humboldt 7. After 5:00 pm on 20 April, a large contingent of police officers arrived and assaulted apartment 201, where the four men were staying. The men were not aware that the police were outside. The police rounded up and executed the rebels, who were unarmed.

The incident was covered up until a post-revolution investigation in 1959. Marquitos was arrested and, after a double trial, was sentenced by the Supreme Court to the penalty of death by firing squad in March 1964.

====Frank País====
Frank País was a revolutionary organizer affiliated with the 26th of July Movement who had built an extensive underground urban network. He had been tried and acquitted for his role in organizing an unsuccessful uprising in Santiago de Cuba in support of Castro&#x27;s landing at the end of November in 1956. On 30 June 1957, Frank&#x27;s younger brother Josué País was killed by the Santiago police. During the latter part of July 1957, a wave of systematic police searches forced Frank País into hiding in Santiago de Cuba. On 21 July, País had hid in Raúl Pujol Arencibia&#x27;s home. An ongoing search in the area forced the two men to relocate, however. On 30 July he was in a safe house with Pujol Arencibia, despite warnings from other members of the Movement that it was not secure. The Santiago police under Colonel José Salas Cañizares surrounded the building. Frank and Raúl attempted to escape. However, an informant betrayed them as they tried to walk to a waiting getaway car. The police officers drove the two men to the Callejón del Muro (Rampart Lane) and shot them in the back of the head. In defiance of Batista&#x27;s regime, País was buried in the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in the olive green uniform and red and black armband of 26 July Movement.

In response to the death of País, the workers of Santiago declared a spontaneous general strike. This strike was the largest popular demonstration in the city up to that point. The mobilization of 30 July 1957 is considered one of the most decisive dates in both the Cuban Revolution and the fall of Batista&#x27;s dictatorship. This day has been instituted in Cuba as the Day of the Martyrs of the Revolution. The Frank País Second Front, the guerrilla unit led by Raúl Castro in the Sierra Maestra was named for the fallen revolutionary. His childhood home at 226 San Bartolomé Street was turned into The Santiago Frank País García House Museum and designated as a national monument. The international airport in Holguín, Cuba also bears his name.

==== Naval mutiny at Cienfuegos ====
On 6 September 1957 elements of the Cuban navy in the Cienfuegos Naval Base staged a rising against the Batista regime. Led by junior officers in sympathy with the 26th of July Movement, this was originally intended to coincide with the seizure of warships in Havana harbour. Reportedly individual officials within the U.S. Embassy were aware of the plot and had promised U.S. recognition if it were successful.

By 5:30am the base was in the hands of the mutineers. The 150 naval personnel sleeping at the base joined with the approximately fifty original conspirators, while eighteen officers were arrested. About two hundred 26th of July Movement members and other rebel supporters entered the base from the town and were given weapons. Cienfuegos was in rebel hands for several hours.

By the afternoon Government motorised infantry had arrived from Santa Clara, supported by B-26 bombers given by the United States. Armoured units followed from Havana. After street fighting throughout the afternoon and night the last of the rebels, holding out in the police headquarters, were overwhelmed. Approximately 70 mutineers and rebel supporters were executed and reprisals against civilians added to the estimated total death toll of 300 men.

The use of bombers and tanks recently provided under a US-Cuban arms agreement specifically for use in hemisphere defence, now raised tensions between the two governments.

==== Escalation and U.S. involvement ====
The United States supplied Cuba with planes, ships, tanks, and other technology such as napalm, which was used against the rebels. This would eventually come to an end due to a later arms embargo in 1958. On the other side, the Cuban rebels were supplied by Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito.

According to Tad Szulc, the United States began funding the 26th of July Movement around October or November 1957 and ending around middle 1958. &quot;No less than $50,000&quot; would be delivered to key leaders of the 26th of July Movement, the purpose being to instill sympathies to the United States amongst the rebels in case the movement succeeded.

While Batista increased troop deployments to the Sierra Maestra region to crush the 26 July guerrillas, the Second National Front of the Escambray kept battalions of the Constitutional Army tied up in the Escambray Mountains region. The Second National Front was led by former Revolutionary Directorate member Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo and the &quot;Comandante Yanqui&quot; William Alexander Morgan, who was dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Army after going AWOL. Gutiérrez Menoyo formed and headed the guerrilla band after news had broken out about Castro&#x27;s landing in the Sierra Maestra, and José Antonio Echeverría had stormed the Havana Radio station.

Thereafter, on 14 March 1958, the United States imposed an arms embargo on the Cuban government and recalled its ambassador Arthur Gardner, weakening the government&#x27;s mandate further. Batista&#x27;s support among Cubans began to fade, with former supporters either joining the revolutionaries or distancing themselves from Batista.

Batista&#x27;s government often resorted to brutal methods to keep Cuba&#x27;s cities under control. However, in the Sierra Maestra mountains, Castro, aided by Frank País, Ramos Latour, Huber Matos, and many others, staged successful attacks on small garrisons of Batista&#x27;s troops. Castro was joined by CIA connected Frank Sturgis who offered to train Castro&#x27;s troops in guerrilla warfare. Castro accepted the offer, but he also had an immediate need for guns and ammunition, so Sturgis became a gunrunner. Sturgis purchased boatloads of weapons and ammunition from CIA weapons expert Samuel Cummings&#x27; International Armament Corporation in Alexandria, Virginia. Sturgis opened a training camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where he taught Che Guevara and other 26 July Movement rebel soldiers guerrilla warfare.

In addition, poorly armed irregulars known as &quot;escopeteros&quot; harassed Batista&#x27;s forces in the forests and mountains of Oriente Province. The &quot;escopeteros&quot; also provided direct military support to Castro&#x27;s main forces by protecting supply lines and by sharing intelligence. Ultimately, the mountains came under Castro&#x27;s control.

In addition to armed resistance, the rebels sought to use propaganda to their advantage. A pirate radio station called &quot;Radio Rebelde&quot; (&quot;Rebel Radio&quot;) was set up in February 1958, allowing Castro and his forces to broadcast their message nationwide within enemy territory. Castro&#x27;s affiliation with the &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Herbert Matthews created a front page-worthy report on anti-communist propaganda. The radio broadcasts were made possible by Carlos Franqui, a previous acquaintance of Castro who subsequently became a Cuban exile in Puerto Rico.

During this time, Castro&#x27;s forces remained quite small in numbers, sometimes fewer than 200 men, while the Cuban military and police force had a manpower of around 37,000. Even so, nearly every time the Cuban military fought against the revolutionaries, the army was forced to retreat. The arms embargo imposed by the United States is a significant contributing factor to Batista&#x27;s weakened forces. The Cuban air force rapidly deteriorated: it could not repair its airplanes without importing parts from the United States.

===Final offensives: 1958–1959===
==== Operation Verano ====

Batista finally responded to Castro&#x27;s efforts with an attack on the mountains called Operation Verano (&quot;Summer&quot;), known to the rebels as &quot;la Ofensiva&quot;. The Cuban army sent an upwards of approximately 10,000 soldiers into the mountains, half of them untrained recruits whom had little experience with treking and fighting through rocky terrain. In a series of small skirmishes, Castro&#x27;s determined guerrillas defeated the Cuban army.

The Battle of El Jigüe, albeit commonly referred to as the Battle of La Plata (1958), was a surprise attack on Fidel&#x27;s base in Sierra Maestra, planned by Cuban army major general Eulogio Cantillo who put Battalion 17 and Battalion 18, commanded by Fidel&#x27;s former peer at the University of Havana José Quevedo Pérez, on the front lines. The battle spanned from 11 to 21 July 1958 and is widely considered to be a &quot;turning point&quot; in the revolution.

However, the tide nearly turned on 29 July 1958, when Batista&#x27;s troops almost destroyed Castro&#x27;s small army of some 300 men at the Battle of Las Mercedes. With his forces pinned down by superior numbers, Castro asked for, and received, a temporary cease-fire on 1 August. Over the next seven days, while fruitless negotiations took place, Castro&#x27;s forces gradually escaped from the trap. By 8 August, Castro&#x27;s entire army had escaped back into the mountains, and Operation Verano had effectively ended in failure for the Batista government.

====Battle of Las Mercedes====

The Battle of Las Mercedes (29 July–8 August 1958) was the last battle of Operation Verano. The battle was a trap, designed by Cuban General Eulogio Cantillo to lure Fidel Castro&#x27;s guerrillas into a place where they could be surrounded and destroyed. The battle ended with a cease-fire which Castro proposed and which Cantillo accepted. During the cease-fire, Castro&#x27;s forces escaped back into the mountains. The battle, though technically a victory for the Cuban army, left the army dispirited and demoralized. Castro viewed the result as a victory and soon launched his own offensive.
Battalion 17 began its pull back on 29 July 1958. Castro sent a column of men under René Ramos Latour to ambush the retreating soldiers. They attacked the advance guard and killed some 30 soldiers but then came under attack from previously undetected Cuban forces. Latour called for help and Castro came to the battle scene with his own column of men. Castro&#x27;s column also came under fire from another group of Cuban soldiers that had secretly advanced up the road from the Estrada Palma Sugar Mill.

As the battle heated up, General Cantillo called up more forces from Bayamo and Manzanillo and approximately 1,500 troops started heading towards the fighting. However, this force was halted by a column under Che Guevara&#x27;s command. While some critics accuse Che for not coming to the aid of Latour, Major Bockman argues that Che&#x27;s move here was the correct thing to do. Indeed, he called Che&#x27;s tactical appreciation of the battle &quot;brilliant&quot;.

By the end of July, Castro&#x27;s troops were fully engaged and in danger of being wiped out by the vastly superior numbers of the Cuban army. He had lost 70 men, including René Latour, and both he and the remains of Latour&#x27;s column were surrounded. The next day, Castro requested a cease-fire with General Cantillo, even offering to negotiate an end to the war. This offer was accepted by General Cantillo for reasons that remain unclear.

Batista sent a personal representative to negotiate with Castro on 2 August. The negotiations yielded no result but during the next six nights, Castro&#x27;s troops managed to slip away unnoticed. On 8 August when the Cuban army resumed its attack, they found no one to fight.

Castro&#x27;s remaining forces had escaped back into the mountains, and Operation Verano had effectively ended in failure for the Batista government.

====1958 Cuban general election====

General elections were held in Cuba on 3 November 1958. The three major presidential candidates were Carlos Márquez Sterling of the Partido del Pueblo Libre, Ramón Grau of the Partido Auténtico and Andrés Rivero Agüero of the Coalición Progresista Nacional. There was also a minor party candidate on the ballot, Alberto Salas Amaro for the Party of Cuban Unity. Although Andrés Rivero Agüero won the presidential election with 70% of the vote, he was unable to take office due to the Cuban Revolution.

Rivero Agüero was due to be sworn in on 24 February 1959. In a conversation between him and the American ambassador Earl E. T. Smith on 15 November 1958, he called Castro a &quot;sick man&quot; and stated it would be impossible to reach a settlement with him. Rivero Agüero also said that he planned to restore constitutional government and would convene a Constitutional Assembly after taking office.

This was the last competitive election in Cuba, the 1940 Constitution of Cuba, the Congress and the Senate of the Cuban Republic, were quickly dismantled shortly thereafter.

====Battle of Guisa====

On the morning of 20 November 1958, a convoy of the Batista soldiers began its usual journey from Guisa. Shortly after leaving that town, located in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra, the rebels attacked the caravan.

Guisa was 12 kilometers from the Command Post of the Zone of Operations, located on the outskirts of the city of Bayamo. Nine days earlier, Fidel Castro had left the La Plata Command, beginning an unstoppable march east with his escort and a small group of combatants.

On 19 November, the rebels arrived in Santa Barbara. By that time, there were approximately 230 combatants. Fidel gathered his officers to organize the siege of Guisa, and ordered the placement of a mine on the Monjarás bridge, over the Cupeinicú river. That night the combatants made a camp in Hoyo de Pipa. In the early morning, they took the path that runs between the Heliografo hill and the Mateo Roblejo hill, where they occupied strategic positions. In the meeting on the 20th, the army lost a truck, a bus, and a jeep. Six were killed and 17 prisoners were taken, three of them wounded. At around 10:30 am, the military Command Post located in the Zone of Operations in Bayamo sent a reinforcement made up of Co. 32, plus a platoon from Co. L and another platoon from Co. 22. This force was unable to advance for the resistance of the rebels. Fidel ordered the mining of another bridge over a tributary of the Cupeinicú River. Hours later the army sent a platoon from Co. 82 and another platoon from Co. 93, supported by a T-17 tank.

====Battle of Yaguajay====

In December 1958, Fidel Castro ordered his revolutionary army to go on the offensive against Batista&#x27;s army. While Castro led one force against Guisa, Masó and other towns, another major offensive was directed at the capture of the city of Santa Clara, the capital of what was then Las Villas Province.

Three columns were sent against Santa Clara under the command of Che Guevara, Jaime Vega, and Camilo Cienfuegos. Vega&#x27;s column was caught in an ambush and completely destroyed. Guevara&#x27;s column took up positions around Santa Clara (near Fomento). Cienfuegos&#x27;s column directly attacked a local army garrison at Yaguajay. Initially numbering just 60 men out of Castro&#x27;s hardened core of 230, Cienfuegos&#x27;s group had gained many recruits as it crossed the countryside towards Santa Clara, eventually reaching an estimated strength of 450 to 500 fighters.

The garrison consisted of some 250 men under the command of a Cuban captain of Chinese ancestry, Alfredo Abon Lee. The attack began on 21 December.

Convinced that reinforcements would be sent from Santa Clara, Lee put up a determined defense of his post. The guerrillas repeatedly attempted to overpower Lee and his men, but failed each time. By 26 December Camilo Cienfuegos had become quite frustrated; it seemed that Lee could not be overpowered, nor could he be convinced to surrender. In desperation, Cienfuegos tried using a homemade tank against Lee&#x27;s position. The &quot;tank&quot; was actually a large tractor encased in iron plates with attached makeshift flamethrowers on top. It, too, proved unsuccessful.

Finally, on 30 December Lee ran out of ammunition and was forced to surrender his force to the guerrillas. The surrender of the garrison was a major blow to the defenders of the provincial capital of Santa Clara. The next day, the combined forces of Cienfuegos, Guevara, and local revolutionaries under William Alexander Morgan captured the city in a fight of vast confusion.

==== Battle of Santa Clara and Batista&#x27;s flight ====
On 31 December 1958, the Battle of Santa Clara took place in a scene of great confusion. The city of Santa Clara fell to the combined forces of Che Guevara, Camilo Cienfuegos, and Revolutionary Directorate (RD) rebels led by Comandantes Rolando Cubela, Juan &quot;El Mejicano&quot; Abrahantes Fernández, and William Alexander Morgan. News of these defeats caused Batista to panic. He fled Cuba by air for the Dominican Republic just hours later on 1 January 1959. Comandante William Alexander Morgan, leading RD rebel forces, continued fighting as Batista departed, and had captured the city of Cienfuegos by 2 January.

Cuban General Eulogio Cantillo entered Havana&#x27;s Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra as the new president, and began appointing new members to Batista&#x27;s old government.

==Aftermath==
===Rebel victory===
Castro learned of Batista&#x27;s flight in the morning of 1 January, and immediately started negotiations to take over Santiago de Cuba. On 2 January, the military commander in the city, Colonel Rubido, ordered his soldiers not to fight, and Castro&#x27;s forces took over the city. The forces of Guevara and Cienfuegos entered Havana at about the same time. They had met no opposition on their journey from Santa Clara to Cuba&#x27;s capital. Castro himself arrived in Havana on 8 January after a long victory march. His initial choice of president, Manuel Urrutia Lleó, took office on 3 January.

After the triumph of the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959, dozens of Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s supporters and members of the armed forces and police were arrested and accused of war crimes and other abuses. On January 11, a revolutionary court in Santiago de Cuba sentenced 4 individuals to death after a 4-hour summary trial. The court was also presided over by Rebel Army Commander Raúl Castro, who was in command of the Oriente province. The Santiago rebels sentenced 68 more men to the death penalty, Raúl Castro declared that &quot;if one was guilty, all were also guilty.&quot; The men were shot in a mass execution at San Juan Hill, on January 12, 1959.

===Provisional Government===

The Cuban Revolution gained victory on 1 January 1959, and liberal lawyer Manuel Urrutia Lleó returned from exile in Venezuela to take up residence in the presidential palace. Urrutia Lleó had campaigned against Batista&#x27;s governing during the 1950s and supported the July 26 Movement, before serving as president in the first revolutionary government of 1959. The new provisional government consisted of other Cuban political veterans and pro-business liberals including José Miró, who was appointed as prime minister.

Once in power, Urrutia swiftly began a program of closing all brothels, gambling outlets and the national lottery, arguing that these had long been a corrupting influence on the state. The measures drew immediate resistance from the large associated workforce. The disapproving Castro, then commander of Cuba&#x27;s new armed forces, intervened to request a stay of execution until alternative employment could be found.

Disagreements soon arose in the new government concerning pay cuts, which were imposed on all public officials on Castro&#x27;s demand. The disputed cuts included a reduction of the $100,000 a year presidential salary Urrutia had inherited from Batista. On 16 February, following the surprise resignation of Miró, Castro had assumed the role of prime minister; this strengthened his power and rendered Urrutia increasingly a figurehead president. As Urrutia&#x27;s participation in the legislative process declined, other unresolved disputes between the two leaders continued to fester. His belief in the restoration of elections was rejected by Castro, who felt that they would usher in a return to the old discredited system of corrupt parties and fraudulent balloting that had marked the Batista era.

On April 9, 1959, Fidel Castro proclaimed that the elections, which were promised to happen after the revolution, were to be delayed by fifteen months. This delay was deemed necessary in order for the provisional government to focus on domestic reforms.

Urrutia was then accused by the &quot;Avance&quot; newspaper of buying a luxury villa, which was portrayed as a frivolous betrayal of the revolution and led to an outcry from the general public. He denied the allegation issuing a writ against the newspaper in response. The story further increased tensions between the various factions in the government, though Urrutia asserted publicly that he had &quot;absolutely no disagreements&quot; with Fidel Castro. Urrutia attempted to distance the Cuban government (including Castro) from the growing influence of the communists within the administration, making a series of critical public comments against the latter group. Whilst Castro had not openly declared any affiliation with the Cuban communists, Urrutia had been a declared anti-communist since they had refused to support the insurrection against Batista, stating in an interview, &quot;If the Cuban people had heeded those words, we would still have Batista with us ... and all those other war criminals who are now running away&quot;. Castro resigned from his position as commander-in-chief, citing the controversy around Urrutia as cause. In the aftermath of Castro&#x27;s resignation, angry mobs surrounded the Presidential Palace, and Urrutia then resigned. Castro was reinstated into his position, and a growing political sentiment in Cuba associated Fidel Castro with the only source of legitimate power. Fidel Castro soon replaced Manuel Urrutia with Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado as President of Cuba. Dorticós was a member of the Popular Socialist Party.

==Legacy==
===Relations with the United States===
 

The Cuban Revolution was a crucial turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations. Although the United States government was initially willing to recognize Castro&#x27;s new government, it soon came to fear that Communist insurgencies would spread through the nations of Latin America, as they had in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Castro&#x27;s government resented the Americans for providing aid to Batista&#x27;s government during the revolution. After the revolutionary government nationalized all U.S. property in Cuba in August 1960, the American Eisenhower administration froze all Cuban assets on American soil, severed diplomatic ties and tightened its embargo of Cuba in January 1961. The Key West–Havana ferry shut down. In 1961, the U.S. government launched the Bay of Pigs Invasion, in which Brigade 2506 (a CIA-trained force of 1,500 soldiers, mostly Cuban exiles) landed on a mission to oust Castro; the attempt to overthrow Castro failed, with the invasion being repulsed by the Cuban military. The U.S. embargo against Cuba is still in force as of 2025, although it underwent a partial loosening during the Obama administration, only to be strengthened in 2017 under Trump. The U.S. began efforts to normalize relations with Cuba in the mid-2010s, and formally reopened its embassy in Havana after over half a century in August 2015. The Trump administration reversed much of the Cuban Thaw by severely restricting travel by US citizens to Cuba and tightening the US government&#x27;s embargo against the country.

===Relations with the Soviet Union===
Following the American embargo, the Soviet Union became Cuba&#x27;s main ally. The Soviet Union did not initially want anything to do with Cuba or Latin America until the United States had taken an interest in dismantling Castro&#x27;s communist government. At first, many people in the Soviet Union did not know anything about Cuba, and those that did, saw Castro as a &quot;troublemaker&quot; and the Cuba Revolution as &quot;one big heresy&quot;. There were three big reasons why the Soviet Union changed their attitudes and finally took interest in the island country. First was the success of the Cuban Revolution, to which Moscow responded with great interest as they understood that if a communist revolution was successful for Cuba, it could be successful elsewhere in Latin America. So from then on the Soviets began looking into foreign affairs in Latin America. Second, after learning about the United States&#x27; aggressive plan to deploy another Guatemala scenario in Cuba, the Soviet opinion quickly changed feet. Third, Soviet leaders saw the Cuban Revolution as first and foremost an anti–North American revolution which whet their appetite as this was during the height of the cold war and the Soviet, US battle for global dominance was at its apex.

The Soviets&#x27; attitude of optimism changed to one of concern for the safety of Cuba after it was excluded from the inter-American system at the conference held at Punta del Este in January 1962 by the Organization of American States. This coupled with the threat of a United States invasion of the island was really the turning point for Soviet Concern, the idea was that should Cuba be defeated by the United States it would mean defeat for the Soviet Union and for Marxism–Leninism. If Cuba were to fall, &quot;other Latin American countries would reject us, claiming that for all our might the Soviet Union had not been able to do anything for Cuba except to make empty protests to the United Nations&quot; wrote Khrushchev. The Soviet attitude towards Cuba changed to concern for the safety of the island nation because of increased US tensions and threats of invasion making the Soviet–Cuban relationship superficial insofar as it only cared about denying the US power in the region and maintaining Soviet supremacy. All of these events led to the two countries quickly developing close military and intelligence ties, which culminated in the stationing of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba in 1962, an act which triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.

The aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis saw international embarrassment for the Soviet Union, and many countries including Communist countries were quick to criticize Moscow&#x27;s handling of the situation. In a letter that Khrushchev writes to Castro in January of the following year (1963), after the end of conflict, he talks about wanting to discuss the issues in the two countries&#x27; relations. He writes attacking voices from other countries, including socialist ones, blaming the USSR of being opportunistic and self-serving. He explained the decision to withdraw missiles from Cuba, stressing the possibility of advancing Communism through peaceful means. Khrushchev underlined the importance of guaranteeing against an American attack on Cuba and urged Havana to focus on economic, cultural, and technological development to become a shining beacon of socialism in Latin America. In closing he invites Fidel Castro to visit Moscow and discuss the preparations for such a trip.

The 1970s and 1980s were somewhat of an enigma in the sense that the two decades were filled with the most prosperity in Cuba&#x27;s history, and it adopted and enacted several brutal features of socialist regimes from the Eastern Bloc. This period is marked as the Sovietization of the 1970s and 1980s. On 11 July 1972, Cuba joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), officially joining their trade with the Soviet Union&#x27;s socialist trade bloc. That along with increased Soviet subsidies, better trade terms, and better, more practical domestic policy led to several years of prosperous growth. Moreover, Cuba was able to strengthen its foreign policy with both communistic, anti-US imperial and non-communistic countries (albeit not including those in North America and Latin America).

It has, however, come into question as to whether this alliance benefitted both Cuba and the Soviet Union equally. For one, there is the belief that the latter utilized the Cuban government and citizens to gain an advantage in foreign military operations, while Cuba received more consequence than reward in return. In addition, was perceived as having &quot;betrayed the revolution&quot; by the United States, this negative perception of the country eventually leading to trade embargoes and active isolation of its government. Whilst Cuba had undoubtedly economically benefitted from its connection with the Soviet Union, the short- and long-term impact has been the subject of discussion amongst scholars.

Cuba maintained close links to the Soviets until the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse and disbandment of COMECON in 1991. The end of Soviet economic aid and the loss of its trade partners in the Eastern Bloc led to an economic crisis and period of shortages known as the Special Period in the Time of Peace in Cuba.

Current day relations with Russia, formerly the Soviet Union, ended in 2002 after the Russian Federation closed an intelligence base in Cuba over budgetary concerns. However, in the last decade, relations have increased in recent years after Russia faced international backlash from the West over the situation in Ukraine in 2014. In retaliation for NATO expansion towards the east, Russia has sought to create these same agreements in Latin America. Russia has specifically sought greater ties with Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Brazil, and Mexico. Currently, these countries maintain close economic ties with the United States. In 2012, Putin decided that Russia focus its military power in Cuba like it had in the past. Putin is quoted saying, &quot;Our goal is to expand Russia&#x27;s presence on the global arms and military equipment market. This means expanding the number of countries we sell to and expanding the range of goods and services we offer.&quot;

===Global influence===

Castro&#x27;s victory and post-revolutionary foreign policy had global repercussions as influenced by the expansion of the Soviet Union into Eastern Europe after the 1917 October Revolution. In line with his call for revolution in Latin America and beyond against imperial powers, laid out in his Declarations of Havana, Castro immediately sought to &quot;export&quot; his revolution to other countries in the Caribbean and beyond, sending weapons and troops to Algerian rebels as early as 1960. In the following decades, Cuba became heavily involved in supporting Communist insurgencies and independence movements in many developing countries, sending military aid to insurgents in Ghana, Nicaragua, North Yemen, and Angola, among others. Castro&#x27;s intervention in the Angolan Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s was particularly significant, involving as many as 60,000 Cuban soldiers.

==Historiography==
===Ideology===
At the time of the revolution various sectors of society supported the revolutionary movement from communists to business leaders and the Catholic Church.

The beliefs of Fidel Castro during the revolution have been the subject of much historical debate. Fidel Castro was openly ambiguous about his beliefs at the time. Some orthodox historians argue Castro was a communist from the beginning with a long-term plan; however, others have argued he had no strong ideological loyalties. Leslie Dewart has stated that there is no evidence to suggest Castro was ever a communist agent. Levine and Papasotiriou believe Castro believed in little outside of a distaste for American imperialism. As evidence for his lack of communist leanings they note his friendly relations with the United States shortly after the revolution and him not joining the Cuban Communist Party during the beginning of his land reforms.

At the time of the revolution the 26th of July Movement involved people of various political persuasions, but most were in agreement and desired the reinstatement of the 1940 Constitution of Cuba and supported the ideals of Jose Marti. Che Guevara commented to Jorge Masetti in an interview during the revolution that &quot;Fidel isn&#x27;t a communist&quot; also stating &quot;politically you can define Fidel and his movement as &#x27;revolutionary nationalist&#x27;. Of course he is anti-American, in the sense that Americans are anti-revolutionaries&quot;.

===Race and racism===

Fulgencio Batista was a mixed-race individual, and his armies frequently consisted of Afro-Cubans of poor economic backgrounds. Batista&#x27;s officers were often of non-white heritage, and of poor economic background, who often used the army to better their social mobility. In contrast, Fidel Castro was white, and a descendent of wealthy land owners. For these reasons, the struggle against Batista often expressed racist overtones.

Members of the Partido Auténtico often referred to Batista as the &quot;black beast&quot; or the &quot;bad mulatto&quot;. Members of the 26th of July Movement often suspected that Afro-Cubans were supporters of Batista. Cuban sociologist Carlos Moore claims that during the revolution it was common to hear jokes ridiculing Batista&#x27;s Spanish proficiency, and table manners, because he was considered a black idiot. The historian Louis A. Pérez claims that white Cubans often claimed that Batista&#x27;s coup was the beginning of a barbaric descent into the &quot;law of the jungle&quot;, inferring Batista&#x27;s rule was that of black savagery.

Historian Mark Q Sawyer claims that 26th of July Movement often published literature that attacked Batista using racist stereotypes. The Senator Rolando Masferrer, who led a Batistiano paramilitary in Cuba, often claimed that the 26th of July Movement would &quot;return blacks to slavery&quot; if successful in overthrowing Batista.

Historian Samuel Farber contends that evidence for mass black support for Batista is sparse, and is doubtful especially considering the suppression of labor unions by Batista which lost him general working class support. However, Farber claims white predominance in the opposition movement is well evidenced.

===Women&#x27;s roles===
The importance of women&#x27;s contributions to the Cuban Revolution is reflected in the very accomplishments that allowed the revolution to be successful, from the participation in the Moncada Barracks, to the Mariana Grajales all-women&#x27;s platoon that served as Fidel Castro&#x27;s personal security detail. Tete Puebla, second in command of the Mariana Grajales Women&#x27;s Platoon, has said:

Before the Mariana Grajales Platoon was established, the revolutionary women of the Sierra Maestra were not organized for combat and primarily helped with cooking, mending clothes, and tending to the sick, frequently acting as couriers, as well as teaching guerrillas to read and write.

Haydée Santamaría and Melba Hernández were the only women who participated in the attack on the Moncada Barracks, afterward acting alongside Natalia Revuelta, and Lidia Castro (Fidel Castro&#x27;s sister) to form alliances with anti-Batista organizations, as well as the assembly and distribution of &quot;History Will Absolve Me&quot;. Celia Sánchez and Vilma Espin were leading strategists and highly skilled combatants who held essential roles throughout the revolution. Tete Puebla, founding member and second in command of the Mariana Grajales Platoon, said of Celia Sánchez, &quot;When you speak of Celia, you&#x27;ve got to speak of Fidel, and vice versa. Celia&#x27;s ideas touched almost everything in the Sierra.&quot;

There were many foreign presences in Cuba during this time. Esther Brinch was a Danish translator for the Danish government in 1960&#x27;s Cuba. Brinch&#x27;s work covered the Cuban Revolution and Cuban Missile Crisis. A collection of Brinch&#x27;s archival materials is housed at the George Mason University Special Collections Research Center.

<doc id="268114" wikidata="Q4702339" url="?curid=268114" title="Al-Dawayima massacre">
<text>The al-Dawayima massacre describes the killing of civilians by the Israeli army (IDF) that took place in the Palestinian Arab town of al-Dawayima on October 29, 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The incident occurred after the town was occupied by the IDF&#x27;s 89th Commando Battalion during Operation Yoav, encountering little resistance.

Benny Morris has estimated that hundreds of people were killed. Lieutenant-General John Bagot Glubb, the British commander of Jordan&#x27;s Arab Legion stated the numbers were much smaller, citing a UN report for a figure of 30 women and children killed. A follow-up report delivered to the United Nations by a delegation from the Arab Refugee Congress reported that the Arab Legion had had an interest in underplaying the extent of the massacre, which was, it claimed, worse than the Deir Yassin massacre, in order to avoid further panic and refugee flight. The village mukhtar Hassan Mahmoud Ihdeib, in a sworn statement, estimated the number of victims as 145.

==Background==

Prior to the attack the village had a population of 6,000, with some 4,000 of that number being recently displaced refugees. The Haganah intelligence service (HIS) considered the village to be &#x27;very friendly&#x27;. Dawayima was situated a few kilometres west of Hebron.

Historian Michael Palumbo wrote that the 89th Commando Battalion was &quot;composed of former Irgun and Stern Gang terrorists.&quot;

==Massacre==
===The village mukhtar&#x27;s account===
According to the village headman, Hassan Mahmoud Ihdeib, half an hour after midday prayers, the village was approached from three groups of troops, from the West, North and South: 20 armoured cars on the Qubeiba-Dawaymeh road, a second group along the Beit Jibrin-Dawaymeh road, and another set of armoured cars approaching from Mafkhar-Dawaymeh. He stated that no call to surrender was announced, and that no resistance took place. Firing began at a distance of 1/2 kilometer as the semi-circular arc of forces closed in. The Israeli troops fired indiscriminately for over an hour, during which time many fled, and two Palestinian groups took refuge respectively in the Mosque and a nearby cave called &quot;Iraq El Zagh.&quot; On returning the day with other villagers, 60 bodies were found in the mosque, mostly of elderly men. Numerous corpses of men, women and children, lay in the streets. 80 bodies of men, women and children were then found in the entrance of the Iraq El Zagh cavern. On making a census, it emerged that 455 persons were missing, 280 men, and the remainder women and children.

===The event according to Benny Morris===


The letter by Kaplan was published in full in Haaretz in February 2016. The original of the letter was removed from the archive where it has previously been available.

Benny Morris writes:

The soldier-witness, according to Kaplan, said
From the sworn Statement given by the Mukhtar of Dawaymeh village, Hassan Mahmaod Ihdeib.

Morris has estimated &quot;hundreds&quot; of people were killed, he also reports on the IDF investigation, which concluded around 100 villagers had been killed, and cites an account by a Mapam member, based on an interview with an Israeli soldier, who reported 80 to 100 men, women and children killed. Saleh Abdel Jawad evaluates the total to &quot;between 100 and 200&quot;.

===Further details according to Ilan Pappe===
Ilan Pappe states that the village was guarded by 20 men who were paralysed by fright when they saw the Israeli troops, and that the semi-circular pincer movement was designed to allow the 6,000 residents the possibility of fleeing eastwards. The massacre took place when the expected wave of flight failed to take place. He also adds that Amos Kenan took part in the assault.

==Aftermath==
===UN inspection team===
Yigal Allon cabled Général Yitzhak Sadeh to check &quot;the &#x27;rumours&#x27; that the 89th Battalion had &#x27;killed many tens of prisoners on the day of the conquest of al-Dawayima&#x27;, and to respond&quot;. On the 5 November, probably worried about a UN investigation, Allon then ordered Sadeh to instruct the unit:
Although unbeknownst to Allon, the 89th had cleaned up the site of the massacre on 1 November 1948.

On 7 November, UN inspectors visited the scene of the village to investigate accusations of a massacre, the accusation being made by the Egyptians and refugees from the village. The team found &quot;several demolished buildings and one corpse but no other physical evidence of a massacre&quot;. The UN team did however take a witness statement from the village mukhtar.

In a November 8, 1948, letter to Alexander Cadogan of the United Kingdom, as then-president of the UN Security Council, the Israeli government denied any massacre had occurred in the village.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/1073&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey S. Eban, Israel&#x27;s representative at the United Nations, claimed Al-Dawayima &quot;had been completely abandoned by its civilian population before it was occupied by Israeli forces in the operations which followed the Egyptian truce violation on October 14th.&quot; Eban further claimed none of the &quot;atrocity stories&quot; reported by the Arab League concerning Israeli conduct &quot;has proved to have had the least substance or foundation.&quot; 

Isser Be&#x27;eri, the commander of the IDF intelligence service, who conducted an independent investigation, concluded that 80 people had been killed during the occupation of Al-Dawayima and that 22 had been captured and executed subsequently. Be&#x27;eri recommended prosecution of the platoon OC, who had confessed to the massacre, but notwithstanding his recommendations no one was put on trial or punished.

On 14 November the Israeli cabinet instructed Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to also launch an investigation. Its findings remain secret.

===Reactions===
The American consul in Jerusalem, William Burdett, who had received news about the massacre reported on November 16 to Washington &quot;Investigation by UN indicates massacre occurred but observers are unable to determine number of persons involved.&quot;

News of the massacre reached village communities in the western Hebron and Judean foothills &quot;possibly precipitating further flight&quot;.

<text>The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is a medium-sized spotted wild cat that reaches at the shoulders and weighs between on average. It is native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Margarita. Carl Linnaeus scientifically described it in 1758. Two subspecies are recognized.

The ocelot is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It prefers areas close to water sources with dense vegetation cover and high prey availability. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as armadillos, opossums, and lagomorphs. It is typically active during twilight and at night and tends to be solitary and territorial. Both sexes become sexually mature at around two years of age and can breed throughout the year; peak mating season varies geographically. After a gestation period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a litter of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own home ranges.

The ocelot is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by habitat destruction, hunting, and traffic accidents. While its range is very large, various populations are decreasing in many parts of its range. The association of the ocelot with humans dates back to the Aztec and Incan civilizations; it has occasionally been kept as a pet.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;ocelot&quot; comes from the Nahuatl word (), which generally refers to the jaguar, rather than the ocelot. Another possible origin for the name is the Latin (&quot;having little eyes&quot; or &quot;marked with eye-like spots&quot;), in reference to the cat&#x27;s spotted coat.

Other vernacular names for the ocelot include (Venezuela), (Argentina), (Panama), (Suriname), , (Brazil), (Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela), , , , , (Belize), (Bolivia) and (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Peru).

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Felis pardalis&quot; was the scientific name proposed for the ocelot by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus &quot;Leopardus&quot; was proposed by John Edward Gray in 1842 for several spotted cat skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London.

Several ocelot specimens were described in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including:

* &quot;Felis mitis&quot; by Frédéric Cuvier in 1824 was a specimen from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
* &quot;F. chibi-gouazou&quot; by Edward Griffith in 1827 was based on earlier descriptions and illustrations.
* &quot;Leopardus griseus&quot; by John Edward Gray in 1842 was a spotted cat skin from Central America.
* &quot;F. pseudopardalis&quot; by Pierre Boitard in 1845 was an ocelot kept in the Jardin des plantes.
* &quot;F. melanura&quot; by Robert Ball in 1844 was a specimen from British Guiana.
* &quot;F. albescens&quot; by Jacques Pucheran in 1855 was a specimen from Brownsville, Texas.
* &quot;F. aequatorialis&quot; by Edgar Alexander Mearns in 1903 was a skin of an adult female ocelot from Talamanca canton in Costa Rica.
* &quot;F. maripensis&quot; and &quot;F. sanctaemartae&quot; by Joel Asaph Allen in 1904 were skins of two adult female ocelots from Maripa, Venezuela and Santa Marta district in Colombia, respectively.
* &quot;F. pardalis pusaea&quot; by Oldfield Thomas in 1914 was an ocelot skin and skull from Guayas Province in coastal Ecuador.
* &quot;F. pardalis nelsoni&quot; and &quot;F. p. sonoriensis&quot; by Edward Alphonso Goldman in 1925 as subspecies of &quot;F. pardalis&quot;, based on specimens from Manzanillo and the Mayo River region respectively in Mexico.
* &quot;L. pardalis steinbachi&quot; by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1941 was a specimen from Buena Vista, Ichilo in Bolivia.
=== Subspecies ===
In 1919, Allen reviewed the specimens described until 1914, placed them into the genus &quot;Leopardus&quot; and recognized nine subspecies as valid taxa based on the colors and spot patterns of skins. In 1941, Pocock reviewed dozens of ocelot skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum and regrouped them to nine different subspecies, also based on their colors and spots. Later authors recognized 10 subspecies as valid.

In 1998, results of a mtDNA control region analysis of ocelot samples indicated that four major ocelot groups exist, one each in Central America, northwestern South America, northeastern South America and southern South America south of the Amazon River. A 2010 study of morphological features noted significant differences in the size and color of the Central and South American populations, suggesting they could be separate species. In 2013, a study of craniometric variation and microsatellite diversity in ocelots throughout the range recognized three subspecies: &quot;L. p. albescens&quot; from the Texas–Mexico border, &quot;L. p. pardis&quot; from Central America and &quot;L. p. pseudopardalis&quot; from South America, though &quot;L. p. mitis&quot; may comprise the ocelot population in the southern part of South America.

In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group noted that up to four subspecies can be identified, but recognized only two as valid taxa. These two taxa differ in morphological features and are geographically separated by the Andes:
* &quot;L. p. pardalis&quot; has a greyish fur. Its range extends from Texas and Arizona to Costa Rica.
* &quot;L. p. mitis&quot; has a more yellowish fur and is larger than &quot;pardalis&quot;. It occurs in South America as far south as northern Argentina.

=== Phylogeny ===
Results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the &quot;Leopardus&quot; lineage genetically diverged from the Felidae around 8 million years ago (mya). The ocelot is estimated to have diverged from the margay (&quot;Leopardus wieldii&quot;) between 2.41 and 1.01 mya. The relationships of the ocelot within the Felidae is considered as follows:

== Characteristics ==

The ocelot&#x27;s fur is extensively marked with solid black markings on a creamy, tawny, yellowish, reddish gray or gray background color. The spots on the head and limbs are small, but markings on the back, cheeks, and flanks are open or closed bands and stripes. A few dark stripes run straight from the back of the neck up to the tip of the tail. Its neck and undersides are white, and the insides of the legs are marked with a few horizontal streaks. Its round ears are marked with a bright white spot. Its fur is short, about long on the belly, but with about long guard hairs on the back. The body has a notably strong odor. Each ocelot has a unique color pattern, which can be used to identify individuals. Its eyes are brown, but reflect in a golden hue when illuminated. It has 28 to 30 teeth, with the dental formula . It has a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 113.8. Only one ocelot is known to possess albinism, and the appearance of such a trait in ocelots is likely an indication of shrinking populations due to deforestation.

With a head-and-body length ranging from and a long tail, the ocelot is the largest member of the genus &quot;Leopardus&quot;. It typically reaches at the shoulder. The weight of females ranges between and of males between . Its footprint measures nearly .

The ocelot can be confused with the margay (&quot;Leopardus wiedii&quot;) and the oncilla (&quot;L. tigrinus&quot;), though the ocelot is noticeably larger and heavier with a shorter tail. Though all three have rosettes on their coats, the ocelot typically has a more blotched pattern; the oncilla has dark spots on its underbelly unlike the other two. Other differences lie in the facial markings, appearance of the tail and fur characteristics. The ocelot is similar in size to a bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), though larger individuals have occasionally been recorded. The jaguar is notably larger and heavier, and has rosettes instead of spots and stripes.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The ocelot ranges from the southwestern United States to northern Argentina, up to an elevation of . In the United States, it occurs in Texas and Arizona, and is extirpated from Louisiana and Arkansas. Ocelots fossils were found in Florida.

It inhabits tropical forests, thorn forests, mangrove swamps and savannas. In the Amazon rainforest, it prefers habitats with availability of prey and water, and tends to avoid other predators. It favors areas with dense forest cover and water sources, far from roads and human settlement, avoiding steep slopes and highly elevated areas. In areas where ocelots coexist with larger predators such as cougars and humans, they tune their active hours to avoid them, and seek dense cover to avoid competitors. It can adapt well to its surroundings; as such, factors other than the aforementioned are not significant in its choice of habitat.

It shares a large part of its range with the jaguar, jaguarundi, margay, oncilla and cougar.

== Ecology and behavior ==

The ocelot is usually solitary and active mainly during twilight and at night. Radio collared individuals in the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru rested during the day and became active earliest in the late afternoon; they moved between 3.2 and 17 hours until dawn and then returned to their dens.

During the daytime, it rests on trees, in dens below large trees or other cool, sheltered sites on the ground. It is agile in climbing and leaping, and escapes predators by jumping on trees. It is also an efficient swimmer. It scent-marks its territory by spraying urine. The territories of males are large, while those of females cover . Territories of females rarely overlap, whereas the territory of a male includes those of two to three females. Social interaction between sexes is minimal, though a few adults have been observed together even in non-mating periods, and some juveniles interact with their parents. Data from camera trapping studies confirm that several ocelot individuals deposit scat in one or several communal sites, called latrines. Ocelots can be aggressive in defending their territory, fighting even to death.

The population density of ocelots has been observed to be high in areas with high rainfall, but tends to decrease with increasing latitude; highest densities have been recorded in the tropics. In 2014, the ocelot population density in Barro Colorado Island was estimated to be , greater than recorded in northwestern Amazon in Peru in 2010, which was the densest ocelot population recorded thus far.

Potential predators of the ocelot in Texas include the cougar, coyote and American alligator, while ocelot kittens are vulnerable to raptors, such as the great horned owl, as well as feral dogs, feral pigs and snakes. Studies have found that adult ocelots are vulnerable to predation by both cougars and jaguars, with decreasing water sources in Guatemala causing predatory encounters with the latter.

=== Hunting and diet ===

Ocelots have been observed to follow scent trails in search for prey, walking at a speed of about . Alternatively, an ocelot may wait for prey for 30 to 60 minutes at a certain site and move to another walking at if unsuccessful. An ocelot typically prefers hunting in areas with vegetation cover, avoiding open areas, especially on moonlit nights, so as not to be seen by the prey. As a carnivore, it preys on small terrestrial mammals such as rodents, lagomorphs, armadillos, opossums, also fish, crustaceans, insects, reptiles and birds. It usually feeds on the kill immediately, but removes bird feathers before. It typically preys on animals that weigh less than , but rarely targets large ungulates such as deer, sheep and peccaries, as well as anteaters, New World monkeys and iguanas. It requires of food every day to satisfy its energy requirements.

Primates prevail in the diet of ocelots in southeastern Brazil and iguanas in a tropical deciduous forest in Mexico. The composition of the diet varies by season; in Venezuela, ocelots were found to prefer iguanas and rodents in the dry season and then switch to land crabs in the wet season. In southeastern Brazil, ocelots have a similar prey preference as margays and oncillas. The oncillas focus on tree-living marsupials and birds while the margays are not as selective.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Both male and female ocelots produce a long-range &quot;yowl&quot; in the mating season and a short-range &quot;meow&quot;. Ocelots can mate any time during the year. The peak mating season varies geographically; in Argentina and Paraguay, peaks have been observed in autumn, in Mexico and Texas in autumn and winter. Estrus lasts four to five days and recurs every 25 days in a non-pregnant female. A study in southern Brazil showed that sperm production in ocelots, margays and oncillas peaks in summer. When mating, captive ocelots spend more time together, scent-mark extensively and eat less.

The female gives birth to a litter of one to three kittens after a gestation period of two to three months. Dens are usually located in dense vegetation. A newborn kitten weighs . The kitten is born with spots and stripes, though on a gray background; the color changes to golden as the ocelot grows older. A study in southern Texas revealed that a mother keeps a litter in a den for 13 to 64 days and shifts the young to two or three dens. The kitten&#x27;s eyes open 15 to 18 days after birth. Kittens begin to leave the den at the age of three months. They remain with their mother for up to two years and then start dispersing and establishing their own territory. In comparison to other felids, ocelots have a relatively longer duration between births and a narrow litter size. Captive ocelots live for up to 20 years.

== Threats ==

Throughout its range, the ocelot is threatened by loss and fragmentation of habitat. In Texas, the fertile land that supports dense cover and constitutes the optimum habitat for the ocelot is being lost to agriculture. The habitat is often fragmented into small pockets that cannot support ocelots well, leading to deaths due to starvation. Traffic accidents have emerged as a major threat over the years, as ocelots try to expand beyond their natural habitat to new areas and get hit by vehicles. In the Atlantic Forest in northeastern Argentina, it is affected by logging and poaching of prey species.

The fur trade was a flourishing business in the 1960s and the 1970s that resulted in severe exploitation of felids such as the ocelot and the jaguar. In the 1960s, ocelot skins were among the most highly preferred in the US, reaching an all-time high of 140,000 skins traded in 1970. This was followed by prohibitions on commercial trade of spotted cat skins in several range states such as Brazil and the US, causing ocelot skins in trade to plummet. In 1986, the European Economic Community banned import of ocelot skins, and in 1989, the ocelot was included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. However, hunting of ocelots for skins has continued and is still a major threat to ocelot survival.

Another threat has been the international pet trade; this typically involves capturing ocelot kittens by killing their mothers; these cats are then sold to tourists. Though it is banned in several countries, pet trade survives; in some areas of Central and South America, ocelots are still sold in a few local markets.

== Conservation ==
The ocelot is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution in the Americas. Ocelot hunting is banned in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela; hunting is regulated in Peru. As of 2013, the global population was estimated at more than 40,000 mature individuals. Ocelot populations were stable in some Amazon basin areas as of 2013. As of 2012, the ocelot population in Argentina&#x27;s subtropical regions was estimated to consist of 1,500 to 8,000 mature individuals. It has been recorded in oil palm landscapes and big cattle ranches in the Colombian Llanos and inter-Andean valleys.

=== In Texas ===
In Texas and northeastern Mexico, ocelot populations have reduced drastically; as of 2014, the population in Texas was estimated to be 50–80 individuals. The reduced numbers have led to increased inbreeding and low genetic diversity. Despite this, the US Fish and Wildlife Service failed to acknowledge the ocelot population in Texas as a distinct population segment worthy of listing as endangered. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and The Nature Conservancy are among agencies actively involved in ocelot conservation efforts, such as the protection and regeneration of vegetation in the Rio Grande Valley. Much of the reintroduction effort is taking place on private lands. NatureServe considers the ocelot &quot;apparently secure&quot; globally, but &quot;critically imperiled&quot; in Texas and Arizona.

=== In captivity ===
The American Zoo and Aquarium Association established a Species Survival Plan for the ocelot populations in Brazil. In 2006, the captive population in North American zoos consisted of 16 ocelots representing six founders and their offspring. Some litters were produced using artificial insemination.
The Emperor Valley Zoo in Trinidad keeps foremost confiscated and trapped ocelots.

== In culture ==
Ocelots have been associated with humans since the time of the Aztec and Incan civilizations, who depicted ocelots in their art and mythology. Representations of ocelots appear in every artistic medium, from Moche ceramics to murals, architectural details, and landscape features. Ocelot bones were made into thin, pointed instruments to pierce ears and limbs for ritual bloodletting. Several figurines depicting ocelots and similar felids are known. In her 1904 work &quot;A Penitential Rite of the Ancient Mexicans&quot;, archaeologist Zelia Nuttall described a statue depicting an ocelot or another felid excavated in Mexico City and its relation to the Aztec deity Tezcatlipoca. She argued that the sculpture depicted an ocelot, writing,

Moreover, she described a photograph of a seated person to corroborate her claim:

Like many other felids, occasionally ocelots are kept as pets. They might demand a lot of attention from their owners and have a tendency to chew on or suck on objects, such as fabric and the fingers of their owners; this can lead them to accidentally ingest objects such as tennis balls. Agile and playful, pet ocelots can be troublesome to keep due to their habit of leaping around and potentially damaging objects; ocelots may unintentionally injure their owners with bites. Nevertheless, carefully raised ocelots can be highly affectionate. Painter Salvador Dalí kept a pet ocelot named Babou that was seen with him at many places he visited, including a voyage aboard SS &quot;France&quot;. When one of the diners at a New York restaurant was alarmed by his ocelot, Dali told her that it was a common domestic cat that he had &quot;painted over in an op art design&quot;. Opera singer Lily Pons and musician Gram Parsons are also known to have kept ocelots.

<text>The Laestadian Lutheran Church (LLC) is a religious Christian movement, with teachings based from the Bible and the Lutheran Confessions. From June 9, 1973, the organisation was named the Association of American Laestadian Congregations (AALC), before the association changed its name in 1994 in order better to convey its spiritual heritage. , the Laestadian Lutheran Church has 33 member congregations in the United States and Canada, with highest concentrations of members in Minnesota, Washington, Arizona, Michigan in the United States and in Saskatchewan, Canada; the congregations are served by about 90 ministers, nearly all of them lay preachers.

In Northern Europe, the association&#x27;s sister organizations are the Conservative Laestadians&#x27; Central Association of the Finnish Associations of Peace (&#x27;) in [[Finland]], the [[Sveriges fridsföreningarnas centralorganisation]] in Sweden, and the [[Estonian Lutheran Association of Peace]] (&#x27;).

The main teaching among them is of Jesus&#x27; suffering, death, and resurrection. The work of Jesus Christ continues in this world as the work of the Holy Spirit. The Laestadian Lutheran Church teaches of God&#x27;s kingdom and the need for repentance and the forgiveness of sins. The church holds, in accord with the Lutheran Confessions, that the Bible is the highest guide and authority for Christian faith, doctrine, and life. The norms in the congregation such as refraining from birth control, makeup, and dancing, are some of the things members do not feel are right to do as a child of God.

The Laestadian Lutheran Church takes its name from Martin Luther and Lars Levi Laestadius. Laestadius was a Lutheran pastor who served in northern Sweden from 1825 to 1861. The movement reached North America with Finnish immigrants in the 1860s. Congregations were first formally organized in Cokato, Minnesota, in 1872 and Calumet, Michigan, in 1873. The Laestadian movement in North America has suffered a number of schisms since 1890. The subjects of disagreement have mainly been the understanding of justification, God&#x27;s congregation, and the sacraments. The last division occurred in 1973 and resulted in the establishment of the Laestadian Lutheran Church, with the antithesis being the First Apostolic Lutheran Church.

<doc id="268119" wikidata="Q4590987" url="?curid=268119" title="Solomon and Saturn">
<text>Solomon and Saturn is the generic name given to four Old English works, which present a dialogue of riddles between Solomon, the king of Israel, and Saturn, identified in two of the poems as a prince of the Chaldeans.

On account of earlier editorial tendencies, the two poetical works, &quot;Solomon and Saturn I&quot; and &quot;Solomon and Saturn II&quot;, have often been read as a single, continuous poem. They are considered to be among the most enigmatic and difficult poems in the Old English corpus.

==The &quot;Prose Solomon and Saturn&quot;==

The &quot;Prose Solomon and Saturn&quot; in the Nowell Codex (the &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript) is a question-and-answer text dealing chiefly with issues of biblical or Christian lore. It has many similarities to a later Old English prose dialogue, &quot;Adrian and Ritheus&quot; and, later still, the Middle English &quot;Master of Oxford&#x27;s Catechism&quot;.

The &quot;Prose Solomon and Saturn&quot; has as one of its riddles: &quot;Who invented letters? Mercurius the giant.&quot; The Anglo-Saxons routinely identified Mercury with Woden (known in Old Norse as &quot;Óðinn&quot;, and widely today as Odin), who gave his name to Wednesday.

==Poetic versions==

&quot;Solomon and Saturn I&quot;, &quot;Solomon and Saturn II&quot;, and the &quot;Pater Noster Solomon and Saturn&quot; in MS Cambridge, Corpus Christi College (CCCC) 422 are often compared to the &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; and &quot;Alvíssmál&quot; and other similar poems in the Old Norse &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;.

===Date===

As with most Old English poetry, the &quot;Solomon and Saturn&quot; poems have proved to be very difficult to date. Patrick O&#x27;Neill has argued for a connection to the court of Alfred the Great (reigned 886 – 26 October 899), but Daniel Anlezark sees the poem as fitting into the cultural milieu of Dunstan&#x27;s Glastonbury in the mid-tenth century.

The &quot;Solomon and Saturn&quot; texts are often considered the earliest examples of a broader European literary tradition of Solomonic dialogues. These include the comparatively later dialogues of Solomon and Marcolf, which are attested in a number of European languages.

===&quot;Solomon and Saturn I&quot;===

&quot;Solomon and Saturn I&quot; is one of the few Old English poems to survive in more than one manuscript. It appears in MS CCCC 41 and MS CCCC 422.

===&quot;Solomon and Saturn II&quot;===

&quot;Solomon and Saturn II&quot;, which is often regarded as having more aesthetic merit, contains a number of riddles, including two of the most obscure passages in Old English literature, the &quot;Weallande Wulf&quot; and &quot;Vasa Mortis&quot; riddles.

====&quot;Weallende Wulf&quot;====
Saturn&#x27;s first riddle describes a dragonslayer named Wulf and the wasteland that arises after his death. The poem&#x27;s earlier editor, Robert Menner, argued that the &quot;weallende Wulf&quot; passage stems from ancient Hebrew legends regarding Nimrod and the builders of the Tower of Babel. He interprets Wulf as the Babylonian god Bel, who is connected with Saturn in Isidore&#x27;s &quot;Etymologies&quot;. Andy Orchard has found similarities between Wulf and &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Daniel Anlezark has argued that the passage participates in an &quot;Avernian tradition&quot; that describes impassable wastelands of ancient history. Tristan Major has suggested that the passage is a conflation of biblical and classic material, and that Wulf is to be identified with the mythological Perseus.

====&quot;Vasa Mortis&quot;====
The riddle describes a mysterious bird that has been bound by Solomon until and is feared by the leaders of the Philistines. The final line of the passage names the bird as &quot;Vasa Mortis&quot;. Robert Menner has argued that ancient Jewish legends of Solomon&#x27;s struggles with demons are at the heart of the riddle, and he identifies the &quot;Vasa Mortis&quot; with the demon Asmodeus. Cilluffo sees parallels between the &quot;Vasa Mortis&quot; and the description of Fame in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, as well as the nocturnal monster in the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Liber Monstrorum&quot; and the griffin in the &quot;Wonders of the East&quot;.

===Themes===

Kathryn Powell has described these poetic versions as examples of &quot;orientalist fantasy&quot;, which works to suppress anxieties about English cultural identity. She argues that they attempt to minimise anxieties about the unstable condition of knowledge, and about the future of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and the Christian faith, by &quot;displacing any lack of knowledge, political stability or faith onto the Eastern and pagan figure of Saturn and the Chaldean people he represents&quot;. Powell suggests that the dialogues&#x27; original readers were encouraged to identify with the figure of Solomon, who is constructed as a model of Christian ideals and behaviour.

<text>Republicanism in the United Kingdom is the political movement that seeks to replace the United Kingdom&#x27;s monarchy with a republic. Supporters of the movement, called republicans, support alternative forms of governance to a monarchy, such as an elected head of state. Monarchy has been the form of government used in the United Kingdom and its predecessor domains almost exclusively since the Middle Ages, except for a brief interruption in the years 1649–1660, during which a republican government did exist under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell.

After Cromwell&#x27;s Protectorate fell and the monarchy was restored, governing duties were increasingly handed to Parliament, especially with the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The adoption of the constitutional monarchy system made the argument for full republicanism less urgent. It was once again a topic of discussion during the late 18th century with the American Revolution, and grew more important with the French Revolution, when the concern was how to deal with the French Republic on their doorstep. This led to a widespread anti-republican movement in Britain, and the issue was dormant for a time.

Dissatisfaction with British rule led to a longer period of agitation in the early 19th century, with failed republican revolutions in Canada in the late 1830s and Ireland in 1848. This led to the Treason Felony Act in 1848, which made it illegal to advocate for republicanism. Another &quot;significant incarnation&quot; of republicanism broke out in the late 19th century, when Queen Victoria went into mourning and largely disappeared from public view after the death of her husband, Prince Albert. This led to questions about whether or not the institution should continue, with politicians speaking in support of abolition. This ended when Victoria returned to public duties later in the century, and regained significant public support.

More recently, in the early 21st century, increasing dissatisfaction with the House of Windsor, especially after the death of Elizabeth II in 2022, has led to public support for the monarchy reaching historical lows.

==Context==
In Britain, republican sentiment has largely focused on the abolition of the British monarchy, rather than the dissolution of the British Union or independence for its constituent countries. In Northern Ireland, the term &quot;republican&quot; is usually used in the sense of Irish republicanism. While also against the monarchy, Irish republicans are against the presence of the British state in any form on the island of Ireland and advocate creating a united Ireland, an all-island state comprising the whole of Ireland. Unionists who support a British republic also exist in Northern Ireland, but they do not call themselves republican.

There are republican members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales who advocate independence for those countries as republics. The SNP&#x27;s official policy is that the British monarch would remain head of state of an independent Scotland, unless the people of Scotland decided otherwise. Plaid Cymru have a similar view for Wales, although its youth wing, Plaid Ifanc, has an official policy advocating a Welsh republic. The Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Greens both support an independent Scottish republic.

===Legal context===
Advocacy of the replacement of the monarchy with a republic has long been an imprisonable offence in law. The Treason Felony Act 1848 prohibits the advocacy of a republic in print. The penalty for such advocacy, even if the republic is to be set up by peaceful means, is lifetime imprisonment. This Act remains in force in the United Kingdom. However, under the Human Rights Act 1998, the Law Lords have held that although the Treason Felony Act remains on the statute books it must be interpreted so as to be compatible with the Human Rights Act, and therefore no longer prohibits peaceful republican activity.

==History==
Since the 1650s, early modern English republicanism has been extensively studied by historians. James Harrington (1611–1677) is generally considered to be the most representative republican writer of the era.

===Commonwealth of England===

The countries that now make up the United Kingdom, together with the now Republic of Ireland, were briefly ruled as a republic in the 17th century, first under the Commonwealth consisting of the Rump Parliament and the Council of State (1649–1653) and then under the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell and later his son Richard (1658–1659), and finally under the restored Rump Parliament (1659–1660). The Commonwealth Parliament represented itself as a republic in the classical model, with John Milton writing an early defence of republicanism in the idiom of constitutional limits on a monarch&#x27;s power. Cromwell&#x27;s Protectorate was less ideologically republican and was seen by Cromwell as restoring the mixed constitution of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy found in classical literature and English common law discourse.

First, the Kingdom of England was declared to be the Commonwealth of England and then Scotland and Ireland were briefly forced into union with England by the army. Cromwell and Thomas Fairfax were often ruthless in putting down the mutinies which occurred within their own army towards the end of the civil wars (prompted by Parliament&#x27;s failure to pay the troops). They showed little sympathy for the Levellers, an egalitarian movement which had contributed greatly to Parliament&#x27;s cause, but sought representation for ordinary citizens. The Leveller point of view had been strongly represented in the Putney Debates, held between the various factions of the army in 1647, just prior to the king&#x27;s temporary escape from army custody. Cromwell and the grandees were not prepared to permit such a radical democracy and used the debates to play for time while the future of the King was being determined. Catholics were persecuted zealously under Cromwell. Although he personally was in favour of religious toleration – &quot;liberty for tender consciences&quot; – not all his compatriots agreed. The war led to much death and chaos in Ireland, where Irish Catholics and Protestants who fought for the Royalists were persecuted. There was a ban on many forms of entertainment, as public meetings could be used as a cover for conspirators; horse racing was banned, the maypoles were famously cut down, the theatres were closed, and Christmas celebrations were outlawed for being too ceremonial, Catholic, and &quot;popish&quot;.

Much of Cromwell&#x27;s power was due to the Rump Parliament, a Parliament purged of opposition to grandees in the New Model Army. Whereas Charles I had been in part restrained by a Parliament that would not always do as he wished (the cause of the civil war), Cromwell was able to wield much more power as only loyalists were allowed to become MPs, turning the chamber into a rubber-stamping organisation. This was ironic given his complaints about Charles I acting without heeding the &quot;wishes&quot; of the people. Even so, he found it almost impossible to get his Parliaments to follow all his wishes. His executive decisions were often thwarted, most famously in the ending of the rule of the regional major generals appointed by himself.

In 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament, presenting him with a dilemma since he had played a great role in abolishing the monarchy. After two months of deliberation, he rejected the offer. Instead, he was ceremonially re-installed as Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland (Wales was a part of England), with greater powers than he had previously held. It is often suggested that offering Cromwell the crown was an effort to curb his power: as a king, he would be obliged to honour agreements such as Magna Carta, but under the arrangement he had designed he had no such restraints. This allowed him to preserve and enhance his power and the army&#x27;s while decreasing Parliament&#x27;s control over him, probably to enable him to maintain a well-funded army that Parliament could not be depended upon to provide. The office of Lord Protector was not formally hereditary, although Cromwell was able to nominate his own successor in his son, Richard.

===Restoration of the monarchy===
Although England, Scotland and Ireland became constitutional monarchies, after the reigns of Charles II and his brother James II and VII, and with the ascension of William III and Mary II to the English, Irish and Scottish thrones as a result of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, there have been movements throughout the last few centuries whose aims were to remove the monarchy and establish a republican system. A notable period was the time in the late 18th century and early 19th century when many Radicals such as the minister Joseph Fawcett were openly republican.

===American and French Revolutions===

The American Revolution had a great impact on political thought in Ireland and Britain. According to Christopher Hitchens, the British–American author, philosopher, politician and activist, Thomas Paine was the &quot;moral author of the American Revolution&quot;, who posited in the soon widely read pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot; (January 1776) that the conflict of the Thirteen Colonies with the Hanoverian monarchy in London was best resolved by setting up a separate democratic republic. To him, republicanism was more important than independence. However, the circumstances forced the American revolutionaries to give up any hope of reconciliation with Britain, and reforming its &#x27;corrupt&#x27; monarchial government, that so often dragged the American colonies in its European wars, from within. He and other British republican writers saw in the Declaration of Independence (4 July 1776) a legitimate struggle against the Crown, that violated people&#x27;s freedom and rights, and denied them representation in politics.
When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, debates started in the British Isles on how to respond. Soon a pro-Revolutionary republican and anti-Revolutionary monarchist camp had established themselves among the intelligentsia, who waged a pamphlet war until 1795. Prominent figures of the republican camp were Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin and Paine.

Paine would also play an important role inside the revolution in France as an elected member of the National Convention (1792–1793), where he lobbied for an invasion of Britain to establish a republic after the example of the United States, France and its sister republics, but also opposed the execution of Louis XVI, which got him arrested. The First French Republic would indeed stage an expedition to Ireland in December 1796 to help the Society of United Irishmen set up an Irish republic to destabilise the United Kingdom, but this ended in a failure. The subsequent Irish Rebellion of 1798 was suppressed by forces of the British Crown. Napoleon also planned an invasion of Britain since 1798 and more seriously since 1803, but in 1804 he relinquished republicanism by crowning himself Emperor of the French and converting all Sister Republics into client kingdoms of the French Empire, before calling off the invasion of Britain altogether in 1805.

===Revolutionary republicanism, 1800–1848===
From the start of the French Revolution into the early 19th century, the revolutionary blue-white-red tricolour was used throughout England, Wales and Ireland in defiance of the royal establishment. During the 1816 Spa Fields riots, a green, white and red horizontal flag appeared for the first time, soon followed by a red, white and green horizontal version allegedly in use during the 1817 Pentrich rising and the 1819 Peterloo massacre. The latter is now associated with Hungary, but then it became known as the British Republican Flag. It may have been inspired by the French revolutionary tricolour, but this is unclear. It was however often accompanied by slogans consisting of three words such as &quot;Fraternity – Liberty – Humanity&quot; (a clear reference to &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot;), and adopted by the Chartist movement in the 1830s.

Besides these skirmishes in Great Britain itself, separatist republican revolutions against the British monarchy during the Canadian Rebellions of 1837–1838 and the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 failed.

Parliament passed the Treason Felony Act in 1848. This act made advocacy of republicanism punishable by transportation to Australia, which was later amended to life imprisonment. The law is still on the statute books; however in a 2003 case, the Law Lords stated that &quot;It is plain as a pike staff to the respondents and everyone else that no one who advocates the peaceful abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a republican form of government is at any risk of prosecution&quot;, for the reason that the Human Rights Act 1998 would require the 1848 Act to be interpreted in such a way as to render such conduct non-criminal.

===Late 19th century===
During the later years of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, there was considerable criticism of her decision to withdraw from public life following the death of her husband, Prince Albert. This resulted in a &quot;significant incarnation&quot; of republicanism. During the 1870s, calls for Britain to become a republic on the American or French model were made by the politicians Charles Dilke and Charles Bradlaugh, as well as journalist George W. M. Reynolds. This was also an era in which British republicans supported Irish republicans and in which the Irish Home Rule movement had advocates in England and Scotland within the context of loyal opposition. The British republican presence continued in debates and the Labour press, especially in the event of royal weddings, jubilees and births, until well into the Interwar period.

Some prominent members of the nascent labour movement, such as Independent Labour Party leader Keir Hardie (1856–1915), also held republican views.

===20th-century republicanism===
In 1923, at the annual Labour Party Conference, two motions were proposed, supported by Ernest Thurtle and Emrys Hughes. The first was &quot;that the Royal Family is no longer a necessary party of the British constitution&quot;, and the second was &quot;that the hereditary principle in the British Constitution be abolished&quot;. George Lansbury responded that, although he too was a republican, he regarded the issue of the monarchy as a &quot;distraction&quot; from more important issues. Lansbury added that he believed the &quot;social revolution&quot; would eventually remove the monarchy peacefully in the future. Both of the motions were overwhelmingly defeated. Following this event, most of the Labour Party moved away from advocating republican views.

Following the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936, MP James Maxton proposed a &quot;republican amendment&quot; to the Abdication Bill, which would have established a Republic in Britain. Maxton argued that while the monarchy had benefited Britain in the past, it had now &quot;outlived its usefulness&quot;. Five MPs voted to support the bill, including Alfred Salter. However, the bill was defeated by 403 votes. It was not until 1937 that the first British polling company was established, but questions about retaining the monarchy do not appear to have been asked by any such organisation until some years later.

As noted by Roger Mortimore, &quot;the oldest continuing trend series on the straight-choice, monarchy-or-republic, question began only in 1993.&quot; He adds, &quot;it seems not to have been until 1966 that any client took the plunge by commissioning a poll directly measuring support for the monarchy.&quot; According to Mortimore, this &quot;was commissioned for a &quot;Panorama&quot; programme to mark Prince Charles&#x27;s eighteenth birthday, and the poll found that &#x27;about a sixth of the British people think they would like to see the monarchy abolished&#x27;. Three Gallup polls in the early and mid-1970s showed support for the status quo significantly higher than this, although they may have tilted the balance in the monarchy&#x27;s favour by stating the alternative as &#x27;a President, as they have in America and some European countries&#x27; at a period when the public standing of the American presidency in Britain cannot have been at its highest.&quot;

Willie Hamilton, a republican Scottish Labour MP who served from 1950 to 1987, was known for his outspoken anti-royal views. He discussed these at length in his 1975 book &quot;My Queen and I&quot;. However, all available evidence suggests that his view remained one shared by a small minority of Britons for most of his time in Parliament. In &quot;Crown and People&quot; (1978), royal historian Philip Ziegler summarised public opinion on the monarchy in the quarter-century between Elizabeth II&#x27;s accession to the throne and her Silver Jubilee in 1977: &quot;In the years after 1953 Britain entered the age of the psephologist. More and more often allegedly representative cross-sections of the British people found themselves interrogated about their views on abortion, religion, washing-machines, national politics or pornographic films.&quot; He notes that on thirteen occasions between 1953 and 1976, via varying questions, the public were asked whether they would prefer Britain to continue with a monarchical form of government or for the country to become a republic. Ziegler lists the proportions favouring a republic as 9% in 1953; 10% in 1956 (in a Mass Observation Survey); 14% in 1958 (Mass Observation Survey); 10% in 1960 (Mass Observation Survey); 16% in 1964 (Mass Observation Survey); 10% in July 1969 (National Opinion Polls); 16% in October 1969 (NOP); 10% in October 1970; 19% in June 1971 (NOP); 12% in January 1972 (Gallup); 11% in May 1973 (Gallup); 8% in February 1976 (Gallup); 10% in May 1976 (Gallup). The television film &quot;Royal Family&quot; was first shown in 1969 and watched by a large audience, which may account for the increased interest in the period following its broadcast.

Various questions have been asked by opinion polling companies: in the July 1969 survey by NOP, respondents were asked &quot;In your opinion is the Monarchy a good thing or a bad thing for Britain?&quot; 88% approved, with only 5% disapproving. In October that year, the question NOP asked was &quot;Do you think that Britain needs the Queen or not?&quot; 84% answered &quot;Yes&quot;, and 16% said &quot;No&quot;. Over one in five of those aged 34 and under felt that Britain did not need the Queen (Elizabeth II). The same question was asked by NOP in June 1971. In May 1986, NOP stated that &quot;Nine out of ten people think the monarchy should continue in Britain and only 7% believe it should be abolished.&quot;
The pressure group Republic, which campaigns for a republic in the United Kingdom, was formed in 1983. In 1991, Labour MP Tony Benn introduced the Commonwealth of Britain Bill, which called for the transformation of the United Kingdom into a &quot;democratic, federal and secular Commonwealth of Britain&quot;, with an elected president. The monarchy would be abolished and replaced by a republic with a written constitution. It was read in Parliament a number of times until his retirement at the 2001 election, but never achieved a second reading. Benn presented an account of his proposal in &quot;Common Sense: A New Constitution for Britain&quot;.

In January 1997, ITV broadcast a live television debate &quot;Monarchy: The Nation Decides&quot;, in which 2.5 million viewers voted on the question &quot;Do you want a monarch?&quot; by telephone. Speaking for the republican view were Professor Stephen Haseler, (chairman of Republic), agony aunt Claire Rayner, Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West and Andrew Neil, then the former editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Those in favour of the monarchy included author Frederick Forsyth, Bernie Grant, Labour MP for Tottenham, and Jeffrey Archer, former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. Conservative MP Steven Norris was scheduled to appear in a discussion towards the end of the programme, but officials from Carlton Television said he had left without explanation. The debate was conducted in front of an audience of 3,000 at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, with the telephone poll result being that 66% of voters wanted a monarch, and 34% did not.

At the annual State Opening of Parliament, MPs are summoned to the House of Lords for the Queen&#x27;s Speech. From the 1990s until the 2010s, republican MP Dennis Skinner regularly made a retort to Black Rod, the official who commands the House of Commons to attend the speech. Skinner had previously remained in the Commons for the speech.

Polling results suggest that a large majority of Britons were in favour of the monarchy during the 1990s and 2000s, with support mostly ranging from 70% to 74%, and never falling below 65%.

===21st-century republicanism===
MORI polls in the opening years of the 21st century showed that over 70% of the public supported retaining the monarchy, but in 2005, at the time of the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, support for the monarchy dipped, with one poll showing that 65% of people would support keeping the monarchy if there were a referendum on the issue, and 22% saying they favoured a republic. In a 2006 feature marking the Queen&#x27;s 80th birthday, &quot;Time&quot; magazine quoted MORI founder Robert Worcester on this issue, who called it &quot;the most stable measure in British polling&quot;.

In 2009, an ICM poll, commissioned by the BBC, found that 76% of those asked wanted the monarchy to continue after the reign of the Queen, while 18% of people said they would favour Britain becoming a republic, and 6% said they did not know.

Support for the monarchy appeared to strengthen in the early to mid-2010s, when the Queen celebrated her Diamond Jubilee, and her grandson, who was second in line to the throne, got married in a ceremony broadcast on live television; both events were marked by public bank holidays. Most polls during this period suggesting that between 75% and 80% (and all suggesting at least 69%) of the public were in favour of the monarchy. In February 2011, a YouGov poll put support for ending the monarchy after the Queen&#x27;s death at 13%, if Prince Charles became king.

However, an ICM poll shortly before the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011 suggested that 26% thought Britain would be better off without the monarchy, with only 37% &quot;genuinely interested and excited&quot; by the wedding. The same month, an Ipsos MORI poll of 1,000 British adults found that 75% of the public would like Britain to remain a monarchy, with 18% in favour of Britain becoming a republic.

In May 2012, in the lead up to the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, an Ipsos MORI poll of 1,006 British adults found that 80% were in favour of the monarchy, with 13% in favour of the United Kingdom becoming a republic. This was thought to be a record-high figure in recent years in favour of the monarchy.

Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour MP with republican views, won his party&#x27;s leadership election in September 2015, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party. In 1991, Corbyn had seconded the Commonwealth of Britain Bill. However, Corbyn stated during his 2015 campaign for the leadership that republicanism was &quot;not a battle that I am fighting&quot;.

At the swearing of oaths in the Commons following the 2017 general election, Republic reported that several MPs had prefixed their parliamentary oath of allegiance with broadly republican sentiments, such as a statement referring to their constituents, rather than the Queen. If an MP does not take the oath or the affirmation to the monarch, they will not be able to take part in parliamentary proceedings or paid any salary and allowances until they have done so. Such MPs included Richard Burgon, Laura Pidcock, Dennis Skinner, Chris Williamson, Paul Flynn, Jeff Smith, and Emma Dent Coad. Roger Godsiff and Alex Sobel also expressed sympathy for an oath to their constituents.

The level of support for the monarchy has declined in recent years. , the last published poll in which over 70% favoured the monarchy was in 2019. The proportion favouring a republic has slightly increased at the same time, but has consistently remained a less popular position than maintaining the monarchy. Support for republicanism in Britain has ranged from 13% to 34% since the 1990s, with the figure generally remaining above 20% in the early 2020s. The monarchy is somewhat less popular among Black British groups, British Asians, and younger Britons (those under 35); these demographic groups are generally more in favour of a republic.

In May 2021, a YouGov poll showed reduced support for the monarchy, with 61% in favour and 24% against among all over-18s; there was a particularly high rise in republican views and an overall plurality for its replacement with an elected head of state in the 18–24 age group (41%–31%). The poll also suggested significant reductions in support for the monarchy in 25–49-year olds, and a slight fall in support among over 65s.

In May 2022, ahead of the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee, another YouGov poll showed that only 31% of 18–24-year olds were in favour of the monarchy, compared to 66% of the population as a whole. Four months later, in the wake of the Queen&#x27;s death, this figure stood firm at 67%. However, it has not reached this level since then, and two Savanta polls since King Charles III succeeded his mother have shown support for a republic at over 30%. Aside from a 2022 &quot;Byline Times&quot; poll (which did not include &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot; as an option), these are the first opinion poll results to give figures of over 30% in favour of a republic.

In April 2023, YouGov polling found that less than one third of 18 to 24-year-olds were in favour of the monarchy, compared to 78% of over-65s. The anti-monarchy campaign group Republic reported a doubling of its membership since the Coronation of King Charles III that May, whilst its income had substantially increased. Commenting in November that year, chief executive Graham Smith said, &quot;In 2020, our income was £106,000. It was £172,000 the next year; last year it was £286,000. On the death of the queen, we had £70,000 in donations that month. This year, income is hitting £560,000.&quot;

In a January 2024 poll conducted by Savanta, support for the monarchy stood at 48%, when respondents were asked &quot;What would you prefer for the UK, a monarchy or an elected head of state?&quot;. This was the first time the figure preferring a monarchy had been below 50% since published opinion polling on the topic had begun.

=== Protests ===
Protests against King Charles III have included blank pieces of paper, heckling during royal processions involving Prince Andrew, and egging attempts.

A major protest was planned by Republic for the Coronation of King Charles III in May 2023. However, on the day of the event, Republic CEO Graham Smith and five others were arrested by police. They were held for over 15 hours, before being released.

The Metropolitan Police later expressed &quot;regret&quot; over these arrests, and confirmed that no further action would be taken. This was in spite of Republic having been in discussion with the police about the protests for months beforehand. 

Human Rights Watch UK director Yasmine Ahmed said, &quot;This is something you would expect to see in Moscow, not London.&quot; Hundreds of protesters assembled in central London that day; it was also reported that 300 people had gathered in Cardiff to protest.

A subsequent ceremony in Edinburgh marking the coronation was targeted by republican protesters, led by Patrick Harvie, the co-leader of Scottish Greens and a Scottish Government minister. Chants of &quot;not my king&quot; could be heard inside the venue for the event, which took place in July 2023.

In September 2023, republican activists staged what was called the &quot;first-ever&quot; protest inside Buckingham Palace. In a photo released by Republic, protestors wore T-shirts spelling out &quot;Not My King.&quot; In a statement, Republic said &quot;The protest is the latest in a series of actions aimed at pushing forward the debate about the future of the monarchy&quot;. They said that six of the activists had been briefly detained by security, before being escorted out of the front gate.

The State Opening of Parliament in November 2023, the first by a king in over 70 years, was also met with protests by republicans, who booed King Charles as he arrived. It was later reported that Charles had waved to them from his carriage.

==Supporters of republicanism in the United Kingdom==
A number of prominent individuals in the United Kingdom advocate republicanism.

===Political parties===
, the Green Party of England and Wales, with four MPs in Parliament since 2024, has an official policy of republicanism. The Scottish Greens, with eight MSPs in the 2021–2026 Scottish Parliament, support having an elected head of state in an independent Scotland. The Irish republican party Sinn Féin has seven MPs, but they do not take their UK parliamentary seats as a rejection of UK authority in Northern Ireland.

The Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and the Liberal Democrats do not have an official policy of republicanism. The Scottish National Party, which supports Scottish independence, also does not have an official policy of republicanism, and instead favours making a decision on the head of state of an independent Scotland only after independence is attained in itself.
Labour for a Republic is a republican pressure group of Labour Party members and supporters, founded by Labour activist Ken Ritchie in May 2011. It held its first meeting in 2012. It has since held meetings, other informal meetings, and appeared in the media on a few occasions. As of September 2022, its chairman is Nick Wall. The organisation held an event at the Labour Party&#x27;s annual conference on 25 September 2022, which attracted large crowds, and included &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s columnist Polly Toynbee, author Paul Richards, and expert in constitutional law Dr Adam Tucker as panellists.

In response to the Labour Party&#x27;s decision to sing &quot;God Save the King&quot; at the conference, panellists and those who attended the event said they did not want to see it booed or heckled. It was reported that the singing was not disrupted, and that the minute of silence for the recent death of Elizabeth II was observed without failure. In 2023, the Labour Party added pro-republic campaign group Republic to a list of organisations which local party branches were no longer able to affiliate with.

It is rare for a high-profile British politician to identify with republicanism, even among those who campaigned for a republic earlier in their careers. Former UK prime minister Liz Truss was an advocate of republicanism prior to becoming a Conservative MP. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer was, at an earlier time in his career, also on record as a republican, but no longer identifies as one. His predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, although an avowed left-winger, also stressed that his personal support for republicanism would not influence his policy agenda. The former First Minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party from March 2023 to May 2024, Humza Yousaf, is a republican.

===Republic===

The largest lobby group in favour of republicanism in the United Kingdom is the Republic campaign group, founded in 1983. The group has benefited from occasional negative publicity about the Royal Family, and Republic reported a large rise in membership following the wedding of then-Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Republic has lobbied on changes to the parliamentary oath of allegiance, royal finances and changes to the Freedom of Information Act relating to the monarchy, none of which have produced any change. However, Republic has been invited to Parliament to talk as witnesses on certain issues related to the monarchy, such as conduct of the honours system in the United Kingdom.

In 2009, Republic made news by reporting Prince Charles&#x27;s architecture charity to the Charity Commission, claiming that the Prince was effectively using the organisation as a private lobbying firm (the Commission declined to take the matter further). Republic has previously broken stories about royals using the Freedom of Information Act.

===Media===
Newspapers and magazines such as &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; have all advocated the abolition of the monarchy. In the wake of the 2009 MPs&#x27; expenses scandal, a poll of readers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; placed support for abolition of the monarchy at 54%, although only 3% saw it as a top priority. The online magazine &quot;Spiked&quot; also supports republicanism.

==Opinion polling==
===British Social Attitudes survey===
The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) has collected survey data on public attitudes towards the UK&#x27;s Monarchy since 1983, when the British Social Attitudes Survey first asked about this, with the question &quot;How important or unimportant do you think it is for Britain to continue to have a monarchy: very important, quite important, not very important, not at all important, or, do you think the monarchy should be abolished?&quot; Results for the latter answer between 1983 and 2012 ranged from 3% to 11%.

Since then, the results suggest a long-term decline in support for the institution, with 2023 survey data showing the number of people who said the monarchy was &quot;very important&quot; falling to 29%, an all-time low. 26% said it was &quot;quite important&quot;, making a combined total of 55% believing it was important. This total stood at 54% in the data released a year later, in April 2024. Gillian Prior, deputy chief executive at the National Centre for Social Research, said: &quot;NatCen has been collecting data on the public&#x27;s attitudes towards the monarchy for over 40 years, and it is clear we are observing a downward trend in support for the monarchy.&quot;

===Graphical summary===
The chart below shows opinion polls conducted about whether the United Kingdom should become a republic. The trend lines are local regressions (LOESS).

===Poll results===
The following table includes all known published polls in which the general public in the UK or Great Britain are asked for their preference on the future of the monarchy. Generally, the question revolves around whether they support the continuation of the monarchy or its abolition (regardless of a republic being specified). The question has been framed in different ways: some polling companies have asked whether respondents prefer a monarchy or an elected head of state.

==Arguments==
The public debate around republicanism has centred around the core republican argument that a republic is more democratic and compatible with the notion of popular sovereignty. The advocacy group Republic argues that: 

The primarily anti-republican defence is that there is nothing in a republic that is inherently more democratic compared to a constitutional monarchy, as both forms of government are based on parliamentarianism and constitutionalism, and that traditional institutions have confirmed the citizens as sovereign beings. It has been previously thought, mainly during the Victorian period that the UK is already essentially a republic, and the phrase &#x27;crowned republic&#x27; has been used to refer it accordingly.

===In favour of a republic===
*More democratic: Republicans argue that monarchy devalues a parliamentary system insofar monarchical prerogative powers can be used to circumvent normal democratic process with no accountability, and such processes are more desirable than not for any given nation-state.

It is further argued that monarchy contradicts democracy insofar it denies &quot;the people&quot; a basic right: Republicans believe that it should be a fundamental right of the people of any nation to elect their head of state and for every citizen to be eligible to hold that office. It is argued such a head of state is more accountable to the people, and that such accountability to the people creates a better nation.

*Fairer and less elitist; does not demand deference: Republicans assert that hereditary monarchy is unfair and elitist. They claim that in a modern and democratic society no one should be expected to defer to another simply because of their birth. It is argued that the way citizens are expected to address members, however junior, of the royal family or their representatives, is part of an attempt to keep subjects &quot;in their place&quot;. Such a system, they assert, does not make for a society which is at ease with itself, and it encourages attitudes which are more suited to a bygone age of imperialism than to a &quot;modern nation&quot;. Some claim that maintaining a privileged royal family diminishes a society and encourages a feeling of dependency in many people who should instead have confidence in themselves and their fellow citizens. Further, republicans argue that &quot;the people&quot;, not the members of one family, should be sovereign.
*Based on merit and arouses aspiration: The order of succession in a monarchy specifies a person who will become head of state, regardless of qualifications. The highest titular office in the land is not open to &quot;free and fair competition&quot;. Although monarchists argue that the position of Prime Minister, the title with real power, is something anyone can aspire to become, the executive and symbolically powerful position of Head of State is not.

Further, republicans argue that members of the royal family bolster their position with unearned symbols of achievement. Examples in the UK include Elizabeth II&#x27;s honorary military positions as colonel-in-chief, irrespective of her military experience. There is debate over the roles which the members of the monarchy have played in the military; many doubt that members of the Royal Family have served on the front line on the same basis as other members of the Armed Forces. Examples here include Prince Andrew, whose presence during the Falklands War was later criticised by the commander of the British Naval Force who stated that &quot;special measures&quot; had to be taken to ensure that the prince did not lose his life. It is seen to some as more of a PR exercise than military service.

*Compatible with a multiracial and multicultural society: Some critics have argued that the monarchy of the United Kingdom is incompatible with the multiracial and multicultural British society of the 21st century. The campaigner Peter Tatchell argues that the institution of the British monarchy is unintentionally a racist institution due to a non-white person being unable to become head of state for the foreseeable future. Thus, a monarchy would not be able to provide the same levels of opportunity as a republic in regards to enabling British citizens irrespective of their background to become the UK head of state. Kehinde Andrews argues that the British monarchy is irreparably racist. It is, in Andrews&#x27; view, an institution intimately linked to the colonial past, and is therefore &quot;one of the most powerful symbols of Whiteness and colonial nostalgia&quot;. He considers the popularity of the monarchy to be a barrier to white Britons confronting their imperialist past. He also argues that the marriage into the Royal Family of the biracial Meghan Markle, and the allegedly racist reaction to it in the British press, does not represent a reflection of the diversity of modern Britain, and is &quot;perfectly explicable in terms of the racist status quo&quot;. However, others have criticised the notion that Britain is or should be a multicultural society, like the journalist Ed West.
*Does not impose a state religion: The Church of England is an established church, and the British Sovereign is the titular Supreme Governor. The church is tax exempt and provides the House of Lords in Parliament with 26 unelected bishops as its representatives. On the royal coat of arms is the motto in (God and my right). The movement to end the Church of England&#x27;s status as the state church of England is known as disestablishmentarianism. A country which does not have a state religion is known as a secular state.
*Does less harm to those who would be monarchs: Republicans argue that a hereditary system condemns each heir to the throne to an abnormal childhood. This was historically the reason why the anarchist William Godwin opposed the monarchy. Johann Hari has written a book &quot;God Save the Queen?&quot; in which he argues that every member of the royal family has suffered psychologically from the system of monarchy.
*Favours accountability and impartiality: Republicans claim that monarchs are not &quot;accountable&quot;. The UK monarch benefits from sovereign immunity and cannot be arrested. As of 2022, there were more than 160 laws granting express immunity to the monarch or their property in some respects. For instance, employees of the monarchy cannot pursue anti-discrimination complaints such as those under the Equality Act 2010. The monarchy is exempt from numerous other workers&#x27; rights, health and safety, or pensions laws. Republicans also argue that monarchs are not impartial but harbour their own opinions, motives, and wish to protect their interests. As an example, republicans argue that Prince Charles spoke and acted in ways that were widely interpreted as taking a political stance, citing his refusal to attend, in protest of China&#x27;s dealings with Tibet, a state dinner hosted by the Queen for the Chinese head of state; his strong stance on GM food; and the contents of the black spider memos, which were released following freedom of information litigation, regarding how people achieve their positions.
*Costs less: Republicans claim that the total costs to taxpayers including hidden elements of the monarchy are £510 million per annum. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; claims the monarchy costs each adult in the UK around 62p a year. Republicans also argue that the Royal finances, which are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, are shrouded in secrecy and should be subject to greater scrutiny. Although monarchists argue that this does not take into account the &quot;hereditary revenues&quot; which generated £190.8 million for the treasury in 2007–2008, the advocacy group Republic assert that the Crown Estate, from which these revenues are derived, is national and State property, and that the monarch cannot surrender what they have never owned. The monarchy is estimated to cost British taxpayers £202.4 million, when costs such as security are included, making it the most expensive monarchy in Europe and 112 times more expensive than the presidency of the Republic of Ireland. In addition, there are additional costs. For example, the monarch is exempt from numerous taxes, including inheritance tax, although Queen Elizabeth II did pay some taxes voluntarily. Large events for the royal family can also involve substantial taxpayer support. In 2022, the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II was estimated to have cost £192m, whilst media estimates for the Coronation ceremony for King Charles III in 2023 have ranged from £50m to more than £100m.
*Would make the country not appear &quot;backward&quot;: Republicans argue that the monarchy is to be considered embarrassing: as a concept it is archaic, too reminiscent of medieval feudalism, with a history linked to colonialism and slavery, and whilst the UK has a hereditary head of state it cannot claim to be a modern nation.
*The monarchy is out of touch with the public: It is argued that the monarchy with its vast wealth and luxurious assets (such as Charles III having numerous royal residences, including palaces, castles and estates) is not in touch with the lives of its everyday people, such as those suffering from the cost of living crisis.
*The monarchy represents the idea of superiority due to blood lineage: The institution of monarchy exemplifies and pushes the myth that some people are superior to others due to genetics and ancestry.

===In favour of a constitutional monarchy===

*Provides a focal point for unity and tradition: Monarchists argue that a constitutional monarch with limited powers and non-partisan nature can provide a focus for national unity, national awards and honours, national institutions, and allegiance, as opposed to a president affiliated to a political party. British political scientist Vernon Bogdanor justifies monarchy on the grounds that it provides for a nonpartisan head of state, separate from the head of government, and thus ensures that the highest representative of the country, at home and internationally, does not represent a particular political party, but all people. According to Bogdanor, monarchies can play a helpful unifying role in a multinational state, noting that &quot;In Belgium, it is sometimes said that the king is the only Belgian, everyone else being either Fleming or Walloon&quot; and that the British sovereign can belong to all of the UK&#x27;s constituent countries (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland), without belonging to any particular one of them.

*Helps avoid extreme politics: British-American libertarian writer Matthew Feeney argues that European constitutional monarchies &quot;have managed for the most part to avoid extreme politics&quot; – specifically fascism, communism, and military dictatorship – &quot;in part because monarchies provide a check on the wills of populist politicians&quot; by representing entrenched customs and traditions. Feeny notes that, &quot;European monarchies – such as the Danish, Belgian, Swedish, Dutch, Norwegian, and British – have ruled over countries that are among the most stable, prosperous, and free in the world.&quot; Earlier, in 1956, Iain Moncreiffe and Don Pottinger made a similar argument, writing that, &quot;Such countries achieve a national stability of special value in times of extremist party strife – because the monarch has never been elected. Nobody has ever had to take sides to vote for or against him, and so the constitutional monarch provides a symbol of unity above and outside politics.&quot;
*Does not cost more than a republic would: Some argue that if there were a republic, the costs incurred in regards to the duties of the head of state would remain more or less the same. This includes the upkeep and conservation of the royal palaces and buildings which would still have to be paid for as they belong to the nation as a whole rather than the monarch personally. On top of that, the head of state would require a salary and security, state visits, banquets and ceremonial duties would still go ahead. In 2009, the monarchy claimed to be costing each person an estimated 69 pence a year (not including &quot;a hefty security bill&quot;). However, the figure of 69p per person has been criticised for having been calculated by dividing the overall figure by approximately 60 million people, rather than by the number of British taxpayers.
*Arose from disillusionment with a failed republic: A republican government under the Commonwealth of England and then the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland has already been tried when Oliver Cromwell installed it on 30 January 1649. Yet by February 1657 some people argued that Cromwell should assume the Crown as it would stabilise the constitution, limit his powers and restore precedent. He declined and within three years of his death the Commonwealth had lost support and the monarchy was restored. Later, during The Glorious Revolution of 1688 caused partially by disillusionment with the absolutist rule of James II and VII, Parliament and others, such as John Locke argued that James had broken &quot;the original contract&quot; with the state. Far from pressing for a republic, which had been experienced within living memory, they instead argued that the best form of government was a constitutional monarchy with explicitly circumscribed powers.

<doc id="268135" wikidata="Q339763" url="?curid=268135" title="The Dream of the Rood">
<text>The Dream of the Rood is one of the Christian poems in the corpus of Old English literature and an example of the genre of dream poetry. Like most Old English poetry, it is written in alliterative verse. The word &quot;Rood&quot; is derived from the Old English word &quot;&quot; &#x27;pole&#x27;, or more specifically &#x27;crucifix&#x27;. Preserved in the tenth-century Vercelli Book, the poem may be as old as the eighth-century Ruthwell Cross, and is considered one of the oldest extant works of Old English literature.

==Synopsis==
The framing device is the narrator having a dream. In this dream or vision he is speaking to the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. The poem itself is divided up into three separate sections: the first part (lines 1–27), the second part (lines 28–121) and the third part (lines 122–156). In section one, the narrator has a vision of the Cross. Initially when the dreamer sees the Cross, he notes how it is covered with gems. He is aware of how wretched he is compared to how glorious the tree is. However, he comes to see that amidst the beautiful stones it is stained with blood. In section two, the Cross shares its account of Jesus&#x27; death. The Crucifixion story is told from the perspective of the Cross. It begins with the enemy coming to cut the tree down and carrying it away. The tree learns that it is not to be the bearer of a criminal, but instead Christ crucified. The Lord and the Cross become one, and they stand together as victors, refusing to fall, taking on insurmountable pain for the sake of mankind. It is not just Christ, but the Cross as well that is pierced with nails. Adelhied L. J. Thieme remarks, &quot;The cross itself is portrayed as his lord&#x27;s retainer whose most outstanding characteristic is that of unwavering loyalty&quot;. The Rood and Christ are one in the portrayal of the Passion—they are both pierced with nails, mocked and tortured. Then, just as with Christ, the Cross is resurrected, and adorned with gold and silver. It is honoured above all trees just as Jesus is honoured above all men. The Cross then charges the visionary to share all that he has seen with others. In section three, the author gives his reflections about this vision. The vision ends, and the man is left with his thoughts. He gives praise to God for what he has seen and is filled with hope for eternal life and his desire to once again be near the glorious Cross.

==Structure==
There are various, alternative readings of the structure of the poem, given the many components of the poem and the lack of clear divisions. Scholars including Faith H. Patten divide the poem into three parts, based on who is speaking: Introductory Section (lines 1–26), Speech of the Cross (lines 28–121), and Closing Section (lines 122–156). Though the most obvious way to divide the poem, this does not take into account thematic unity or differences in tone. Constance B. Hieatt distinguishes between portions of the Cross&#x27;s speech based on speaker, subject, and verbal parallels, resulting in: Prologue (lines 1–27), Vision I (lines 28–77): history of the Rood, Vision II (lines 78–94): explanation of the Rood&#x27;s glory, Vision III (lines 95–121): the Rood&#x27;s message to mankind, and Epilogue (lines 122–156). M. I. Del Mastro suggests the image of concentric circles, similar to a chiasmus, repetitive and reflective of the increased importance in the center: the narrator-dreamer&#x27;s circle (lines 1–27), the rood&#x27;s circle (lines 28–38), Christ&#x27;s circle (lines 39-73a), the rood&#x27;s circle (lines 73b-121), and the narrator-dreamer&#x27;s circle (lines 122–156).

==Manuscript==
&quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; survives in the Vercelli Book, so called because the manuscript is now in the Italian city of Vercelli. The Vercelli Book, which is dated to the tenth century, includes twenty-three homilies interspersed with six religious poems: &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;, &quot;Andreas&quot;, &quot;The Fates of the Apostles&quot;, &quot;Soul and Body&quot;, &quot;Elene&quot; and a poetic, homiletic fragment.

==Sources and analogues==

A part of &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; can be found on the eighth-century Ruthwell Cross, which is an , free-standing Anglo-Saxon cross that was perhaps intended as a &#x27;conversion tool&#x27;. At each side of the vine-tracery are carved runes. There is an excerpt on the cross that was written in runes along with scenes from the Gospels, lives of saints, images of Jesus healing the blind, the Annunciation, and the story of Egypt, as well as Latin antiphons and decorative scroll-work. Although it was torn down after the Scottish Reformation, it was possible to mostly reconstruct it in the nineteenth century. Recent scholarly thinking about the cross tends to see the runes as a later addition to an existing monument with images.

A similar representation of the Cross is also present in Riddle 9 by the eighth-century Anglo-Saxon writer Tatwine. Tatwine&#x27;s riddle reads:

Now I appear iridescent; my form is shining now. Once, because of the law, I was a spectral terror to all slaves; but now the whole earth joyfully worships and adorns me. Whoever enjoys my fruit will immediately be well, for I was given the power to bring health to the unhealthy. Thus a wise man chooses to keep me on his forehead.

==Possible authorship==
The author of &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; is unknown. Moreover, it is possible that the poem as it stands is the work of multiple authors. The approximate eighth-century date of the Ruthwell Cross indicates the earliest likely date and Northern circulation of some version of &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;.

Nineteenth-century scholars tried to attribute the poem to the few named Old English poets. Daniel H. Haigh argued that the inscription of the Ruthwell Cross must be fragments of a lost poem by Cædmon, portrayed in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; as the first Christian English poet, stating &quot;On this monument, erected about A.D. 665, we have fragments of a religious poem of very high character, and that there was but one man living in England at that time worthy to be named as a religious poet, and that was Caedmon&quot;. Likewise, George Stephens contended that the language and structure of &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; indicated a seventh-century date. Supposing that the only Christian poet before Bede was Cædmon, Stephens argued that Cædmon must have composed &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;. Furthermore, he claimed that the Ruthwell Cross includes a runic inscription that can be interpreted as saying &quot;Caedmon made me&quot;. These ideas are no longer accepted by scholars.

Likewise, some scholars have tried to attribute &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; to Cynewulf, a named Old English poet who lived around the ninth century. Two of Cynewulf&#x27;s signed poems are found in the Vercelli Book, the manuscript that contains &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;, among them &quot;Elene&quot;, which is about Saint Helena&#x27;s supposed discovery of the cross on which Jesus was crucified. Thus Franz Dietrich argued that the similarities between Cynewulf&#x27;s &quot;Elene&quot; and &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; reveal that the two must have been authored by the same individual. Again, however, this attribution is not widely accepted.

In a series of papers, Leonard Neidorf has adduced metrical, lexical, and syntactical evidence in support of a theory of composite authorship for &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;. He maintains that the poem contains contributions from at least two different poets, who had distinct compositional styles.

==Interpretations==
===Paganism and Christianity===
Like many poems of the Anglo-Saxon period, &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; exhibits many Christian and pre-Christian images, but, in the final analysis, is a Christian piece. Examining the poem as a pre-Christian (or pagan) text is difficult, as the scribes who wrote it down were Christian monks who lived in a time when Christianity was firmly established (at least among the literate and aristocratic population) in early medieval England. The style and form of Old English literary practices can be identified in the poem&#x27;s use of a complex, echoing structure, allusions, repetition, verbal parallels, ambiguity and wordplay (as in the Riddles), and the language of heroic poetry and elegy.

Some scholars have argued that there is a prevalence of pagan elements within the poem, claiming that the idea of a talking tree is animistic. The belief in the spiritual nature of natural objects, it has been argued, recognises the tree as an object of worship. In &quot;Heathen Gods in Old English Literature&quot;, Richard North stresses the importance of the sacrifice of the tree in accordance with pagan virtues. He states that &quot;the image of Christ&#x27;s death was constructed in this poem with reference to an Anglian ideology on the world tree&quot;. North suggests that the author of &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; &quot;uses the language of this myth of Ingui in order to present the Passion to his newly Christianized countrymen as a story from their native tradition&quot;. Furthermore, the tree&#x27;s triumph over death is celebrated by adorning the cross with gold and jewels. Work of the period is notable for its synthetic employment of &#x27;Pagan&#x27; and &#x27;Christian&#x27; imagery as can be seen on the Franks Casket or the Kirkby Stephen cross shaft which appears to conflate the image of Christ crucified with that of Woden/Odin bound upon the Tree of Life. Others have read the poem&#x27;s blend of Christian themes with the heroic conventions as an Anglo-Saxon embrace and re-imagining, rather than conquest, of Christianity.

The poem may be viewed as both Christian and pre-Christian. Bruce Mitchell notes that &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; is &quot;the central literary document for understanding [the] resolution of competing cultures which was the presiding concern of the Christian Anglo-Saxons&quot;. Within the single culture of the Anglo-Saxons is the conflicting Germanic heroic tradition and the Christian doctrine of forgiveness and self-sacrifice, the influences of which are readily seen in the poetry of the period. Thus, for instance, in &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;, Christ is presented as a &quot;heroic warrior, eagerly leaping on the Cross to do battle with death; the Cross is a loyal retainer who is painfully and paradoxically forced to participate in his Lord&#x27;s execution&quot;. Christ can also be seen as &quot;an Anglo-Saxon warrior lord, who is served by his thanes, especially on the cross and who rewards them at the feast of glory in Heaven&quot;. Thus, the crucifixion of Christ is a victory, because Christ could have fought His enemies, but chose to die. John Canuteson believes that the poem &quot;show[s] Christ&#x27;s willingness, indeed His eagerness, to embrace His fate, [and] it also reveals the physical details of what happens to a man, rather than a god, on the Cross&quot;. This image of Christ as a &#x27;heroic lord&#x27; or a &#x27;heroic warrior&#x27; is seen frequently in Anglo-Saxon (and Germanic) literature and follows in line with the theme of understanding Christianity through pre-Christian Germanic tradition. In this way, &quot;the poem resolves not only the pagan-Christian tensions within Anglo-Saxon culture but also current doctrinal discussions concerning the nature of Christ, who was both God and man, both human and divine&quot;.

===Christ as warrior===
J. A. Burrow notes an interesting paradox within the poem in how the Cross is set up to be the way to Salvation: the Cross states that it cannot fall and it must stay strong to fulfill the will of God. However, to fulfill this grace of God, the Cross has to be a critical component in Jesus&#x27; death. This puts a whole new light on the actions of Jesus during the Crucifixion. Neither Jesus nor the Cross is given the role of the helpless victim in the poem, but instead both stand firm. The Cross says, Jesus is depicted as the strong conqueror and is made to appear a &quot;heroic German lord, one who dies to save his troops&quot;. Instead of accepting crucifixion, he &#x27;embraces&#x27; the Cross and takes on all the sins of mankind.

Mary Dockray-Miller argues that the sexual imagery identified by Faith Patten, discussed below, functions to &#x27;feminize&#x27; the Cross in order for it to mirror the heightened masculinity of the warrior Christ in the poem.

===Sexualised and gendered language===
Faith Patten identified &#x27;sexual imagery&#x27; in the poem between the Cross and the Christ figure, noting in particular lines 39–42, when Christ embraces the Cross after having &#x27;unclothed himself&#x27; and leapt onto it. This interpretation was expanded upon by John Canuteson, who argued that this embrace is a &#x27;logical extension of the implications of the marriage of Christ and the Church&#x27;, and that it becomes &#x27;a kind of marriage consummation&#x27; in the poem.

===Parallels with penance===
Rebecca Hinton identifies the resemblance of the poem to early medieval Irish sacramental penance, with the parallels between the concept of sin, the object of confession, and the role of the confessor. She traces the establishment of the practice of penance in England from Theodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury from 668 to 690, deriving from the Irish confession philosophy. Within the poem, Hinton reads the dream as a confession of sorts, ending with the narrator invigorated, his &quot;spirit longing to start.&quot;

<text>The Winchester Mystery House is a mansion in San Jose, California, that was once the personal residence of Sarah Winchester, the widow of firearms magnate William Wirt Winchester. The house became a tourist attraction nine months after Winchester&#x27;s death in 1922. The Victorian and Gothic-style mansion is renowned for its size and its architectural curiosities and for the numerous myths and legends surrounding the structure and its former owner.

==Sarah Winchester==
Sarah Winchester was born in 1839 in New Haven, Connecticut. She was called Sallie by people closest to her, after her paternal grandmother. She married William Wirt Winchester in 1862.

In 1866, Winchester gave birth to a girl named Annie Pardee Winchester. Diagnosed with marasmus, she did not thrive and lived only a month.

Between the fall of 1880 and the spring of 1881, Winchester&#x27;s mother, father-in-law, and husband died. She was left with a large inheritance from her husband.

In 1884, her eldest sister, Mary Converse, died. Around this time, she began developing rheumatoid arthritis and her doctor suggested that a warmer and drier climate might help improve her health. In 1885, at the age of 46, Winchester moved to California from New Haven, Connecticut. According to Mary Jo Ignoffo in her book &quot;Captive of the Labyrinth: Sarah L. Winchester, Heiress to the Rifle Fortune&quot;, her doctor&#x27;s recommendation, her happy memories of traveling to San Francisco with her husband in the 1870s, and advertising about the weather and health benefits of California were possible factors in Winchester&#x27;s decision to move.

Winchester invited her three remaining sisters to follow her to California, which they did.

In 1886, Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Rambo, a San Francisco agent for the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, took Winchester on a tour of the Santa Clara valley to look for a home. He showed her a forty-five-acre ranch for sale that was located near San Jose. She purchased the property from John Hamm which included a two-story, eight-room farmhouse. Since the property reminded her of Llanada Alavesa from the Basque area, she named her new home Llanada Villa.

In 1890, Winchester&#x27;s niece, Marion Merriman (called Daisy) aged around twenty-one, came to live with her. Merriman became Winchester&#x27;s personal secretary, looking after business correspondence and banking. They attended charitable events together and were paying members of Associated Charities and the Red Cross. In 1903, Winchester paid for Daisy&#x27;s wedding to Frederick Marriott III. That same year, Winchester purchased several homes and properties in Atherton. One of the homes was offered to Daisy and her new husband to live in, which they accepted. Winchester subsequently purchased a home for the couple closer to the train station for Fredrick to travel to work from. In 1904, Winchester purchased a large property near the hamlet of Burlingame, north of Coyote Point, then bought a houseboat, or ark as they were called at the time, instead of building a house.

Winchester died on September 7, 1922, at the age of 83.

==San Jose house renovation==
Winchester and her husband had developed an interest in architecture and interior design while building a home on Prospect Hill in New Haven. With plans to expand the farmhouse, Winchester hired at least two architects but dismissed them, deciding to do the planning herself. She designed the rooms one by one, supervised the project, and sought advice from the carpenters she hired. She took inspiration for the house from the world&#x27;s fairs that were common then. While the home was similar in scope to other homes built then, it was unusual for a woman to look after such a project and, Colin Dickey states in his book &quot;Ghostland: an American History in Haunted Places&quot;, she could be considered an architectural pioneer of her time.

She was known to rebuild and abandon construction if the progress did not meet her expectations, which resulted in a maze-like design. In the &quot;San Jose News&quot; of 1897, it was reported that a seven-story tower was torn down and rebuilt sixteen times. As a result of her expansions, there are walled-off exterior windows and doors that were not removed as the house grew in size. Multiple levels, up to five, were added to different parts of the home. The design was essentially Victorian, with elements of Gothic and Romanesque features.

===Features of the house===
There was carved wood on the ballroom walls and ceilings. Woods such as teak, maple, and mahogany were used to make an intricate pattern on the ballroom floor. A large, brick fireplace was framed by two windows that included quotes from Shakespeare. The second floor had bedrooms that each had adjoining sitting rooms and sewing rooms. The wall coverings had a leather or metal appearance, known as Lincrusta wall coverings. The ceilings had mouldings, stencils, and faux finishes. There were chandeliers from Germany, art glass from Austria, furnishings from Asia, and paintings from France. An annunciator, an early form of intercom, which was a common feature of large homes during this time period, was installed for calling servants. There existed an indoor garden with slanted floors that would carry excess water to trap doors which had pipes that would supply water to the outdoor flowers. A generator was installed for a water pump and electricity. Because of Winchester&#x27;s height of four feet ten inches and health issues, a stairway was built that has 44 steps but rises only ten feet.

The windows are unusual since they are pastel-colored, asymmetrical in their design, and have sharp bevels. The windows on the upper levels had a spider-web tracery, a popular design then. The windows to the right and left of the brick fireplace feature Shakespearean quotations from &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. It has been claimed by tour guides and articles over the years that the windows were made by Tiffany &amp; Co despite the fact that the company rarely used beveled glass. This style of window is also found at Craigdarroch Castle in British Columbia, Canada, prompting architectural historian Jim Wolf to believe that the windows were made by the same company. Wolf determined that glass artist John Mallon from Alexander Dunsmuir&#x27;s company, the Pacific American Decorative Company, was the most likely artisan of the windows. This theory was confirmed when an envelope postmarked July 1894, which had the seal of Dunsmuir&#x27;s company on it and a scribbled note that appears to be in Winchester&#x27;s hand, was discovered in the wall of one of the dining rooms that was being restored. Many of the art glass windows that were purchased were never installed and have been housed in a storage room.

Winchester would take breaks from construction on a regular basis to rest, sometimes for months, since she tired easily. It slowed construction considerably and is counter to the claims made in articles and by tour guides that she had the house under construction around the clock for thirty-eight years, until her death in 1922.

At its largest, the house had approximately 500 rooms.

As claimed by Bruce Spoon, a student from San Jose State College who decided to write his master&#x27;s thesis about Winchester in 1951, the reasons for building her large home were to keep workers employed and to express her artistic vision. He reached this conclusion after interviewing people who remembered her and after reviewing newspaper and magazine articles.

===1906 earthquake===
When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake hit, the Llanada Villa was severely damaged. Though there are rumors that Winchester was trapped in the San Jose home, there is no evidence that she was there. She owned several homes in California, and after the earthquake spent most of her time at her home in Atherton.

The seven-story tower and most of the chimneys collapsed. One entire wing was destroyed along with the third and fourth story additions. Winchester had the rubble removed but had little more done to the property after the earthquake. It left doors that opened to nothing where balconies had once been, pipes that were protruding from what were once window boxes, and staircases that once led to upper floors ending suddenly.

After 1910, due to failing health, Winchester did not work on the San Jose home except for odd maintenance jobs and adding an elevator in 1916. At this time, she dedicated her time to finances and building an investment portfolio. Mary Jo Ignoffo claims that, &quot;She was far more successful constructing an investment portfolio than a mansion.&quot;

When Winchester died in 1922, the house had 160 rooms, 2,000 doors, 10,000 windows, 47 stairways, 47 fireplaces, 13 bathrooms, and 6 kitchens.

==As a tourist attraction==

The house became a tourist attraction nine months after Winchester&#x27;s death in 1922. The house was in disrepair and considered to be of no monetary value. A group of investors purchased the property subsequently leasing the house to John and Mayme Brown who turned it into an attraction. They later purchased the house in 1931. There were many room additions and deletions made to the home after Winchester&#x27;s death.

The first tour guide of the house was Mayme Brown. Past neighbors, friends, and workers for Winchester were distressed when they read about superstitious claims being made about the house and Winchester, and were upset the Browns were making money from falsehoods. They described Winchester as clearheaded and savvier with finances and business than most men.

In 1924, Harry Houdini briefly visited the house and was reportedly impressed by its unusual layout and architectural novelties, but could not make a detailed investigation because of more pressing engagements. According to some accounts, Houdini suggested tour operators employ &quot;Winchester mystery house&quot; as a promotional name for the property.

When Keith Kittle, a past Disneyland and Frontier Village employee, became the general manager in 1973, the house was in poor shape. He had the house renovated in the 1970s and 1980s and added a Winchester rifle museum. He sought historical landmark status and began an advertising campaign that included large billboards along the highways. The billboards feature a silhouetted house with implications that a ghost encounter was possible. Attendance increased as he played off the history and superstition that was already circulating. Kittle was general manager until 1996.
As of September 2022, the house is owned and operated by Winchester Mystery House, LLC, which is a private company that represents the descendants of the Browns. &quot;Captive of the Labyrinth&quot; author Mary Jo Ignoffo wrote that tour guides are required to follow a script emphasizing fabrications and inaccuracies. According to Ignoffo, one guide lamented, &quot;I feel so torn because I have to tell people untruths! Every time I go through the house and have to talk about 13s and other &#x27;kooky&#x27; things, my heart breaks a little for Sarah ... I have to bite my tongue every time I hear a guest say, &#x27;what a nutcase.&#x27;&quot;

==Legends and lore==
Winchester&#x27;s story has been embellished over the years by various rumors, hyperbole, and myths, and popular writers have misrepresented or invented details about the house and its owner in order to enhance the legend.

===Inheritance===
Claims of Winchester inheriting as much as $20 million and earning $1,000 per day in royalties from her inheritance can be found in tourist literature purchased at the Winchester Mystery House. Ignoffo states that her husband&#x27;s estate in 1881 was valued at $362,330 (equal to $ today), but this amount included approximately $300,000 of stock that Winchester would only inherit when her mother-in-law died, which did not happen until 1898. With the addition of her husband&#x27;s Winchester Repeating Arms Company shares, she owned a total of 777 shares valuing $77,700, which paid average dividends of $7,770 annually between 1880 and 1885.

===Moving to California===
Myths around her decision to move from the east coast to California are thought to have originated from author Susy Smith in her book &quot;Prominent American Ghosts,&quot; published in 1967. In Smith&#x27;s version of events, Winchester visited a medium in Boston named Adam Coons who told her that she and her family were being haunted by the ghosts of people killed by Winchester rifles, that she must construct a house for these ghosts, and that she must never complete the project. This assertion of Winchester meeting with a medium has been repeated in brochures and articles ever since. According to Ignoffo, while it is plausible that Winchester did meet with a psychic medium since it was a common practice for women of her status at the time, there is no evidence that she did so.

Emily Mace, a scholar, and others have looked through issues of &quot;Banner of Light,&quot; which was a spiritualist periodical, and in the Boston city directories, which listed spiritualists in the area, and no one named Adam Coons could be found.

===Neverending construction===
Beginning around 1895, Winchester started appearing in newspapers. The articles in these local papers were filled with speculation about Winchester and the ongoing construction of her San Jose home. Her lack of interaction with neighbors and the known fact that her money came from the firearms industry fed into a superstitious narrative, despite large, ornate homes being commonly built by the wealthy. The newspapers declared that the reason that the construction was ongoing was that Winchester feared she would have bad luck if the construction would stop. This theory eventually grew into stories that she believed she would die if construction stopped.

In the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), when it added the Winchester home to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, they incorrectly stated that the construction lasted 38 years, and reiterated that Winchester believed she must continue building or she would die. HABS also incorrectly listed the purchase date as 1884 when county records state the purchase was not until 1886.

There were some articles published against the superstitious slant. In one, an unidentified acquaintance refuted these superstitious accusations, stating that they were nonsense and that Winchester was an unusually sensible woman.

While Winchester lived at the Atherton house, her relatives stayed at the San Jose home for almost a year in 1915 to attend the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, which ran for nine months. No construction happened during this time and the staff closed up the house for a week to attend the fair.

Ignoffo states that there is no evidence that Winchester was compelled to keep her construction project running and preferred to focus on estate planning.

===Labyrinthine construction===
The belief that Winchester built her house in its strange, maze-like manner to confuse and keep spirits from harming her and that her sanity was questionable started in the mid-1890s and has grown in scale since her death. The doors and windows that open to nothing, the unusually shallow stairs, the stairs that end in a ceiling, interior barred windows and trap doors in the floor are used to confirm Winchester&#x27;s spirituality and poor state of mind. According to paranormal investigators Nickell and Ignoffo these house oddities have simple explanations. The barred windows were previously exterior windows blocked off as the house additions grew. The doors and windows that opened to nothing resulted from the 1906 earthquake and the severe damage that happened to the house. The small steps were built because of Winchester&#x27;s declining health. The trap doors were constructed in a greenhouse room where excess water could run and be piped to an outdoor garden. After the damage from the earthquake, Winchester did not rebuild the house.

===Bell tower===
The tower bell was used to call workmen and to serve as a fire alarm on the property. According to Joe Nickell, fanciful claims later arose that it was used to &quot;summon spirits&quot;.

===Ghostly music===
According to Joe Nickell, claims that local residents heard &quot;ghostly music&quot; coming from the house are explained by the fact that Winchester often played the pump organ in the Grand Ballroom when she was unable to sleep.

===Parties for spirits===
According to Joe Nickell, claims that Winchester held parties for the spirits in her home that featured lavish dishes served on gold plates kept in a safe are fanciful and unsubstantiated. Nickell wrote that after her death when the safe was opened, no gold plates were found, only personal mementos and a lock of her baby&#x27;s hair.

===Gun guilt===
At the turn of the twentieth century, the most common belief, that still persists, regarding Winchester&#x27;s house building was that she felt tremendous guilt resulting from all the deaths caused by Winchester rifles and from inheriting so much money from the arms company. Ignoffo claims that it is unlikely Winchester had any guilt, since in the 1800s the Winchester Repeating Arms Company was seen as a success, and weapons were viewed as a necessity for survival.

===Health and superstition===
Ignoffo and paranormal investigator Joe Nickell report that as Winchester aged, particularly after 1900 as her health issues grew worse, which included arthritis, missing teeth and neuritis, she became more private and reclusive. This reluctance to appear in public or to socialize with her peers gave her a mysterious reputation feeding the gossip in the community and local newspapers which fuelled the rumor that she was superstitious. Winchester&#x27;s companion of many years, Miss Henrietta Severs states Winchester had no superstitious beliefs. Winchester&#x27;s relatives, employees and gardeners never made claims that she was superstitious, guilt-ridden or crazed.

All her employees were named as beneficiaries in her will.

===Presidents===
Winchester twice declined to host a U.S. president. First, in 1901, President William McKinley visited, and a committee to arrange accommodations was formed, but Winchester did not extend an invitation. The president and his official coaches drove past the mansion without stopping. Second, in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the area and the legend states that Winchester would not open a locked gate to let the president in; it was not true as the president had no interest in meeting Winchester as stopping at the home could have been used to promote rifle sales. He did not want to be seen endorsing any product. Despite there being plausible reasons for her not hosting the presidents, these instances furthered rumors that she was not of sound mind and was a crank.

===The number thirteen===
According to lore, architectural features such as thirteen bedrooms, thirteen bathrooms, and thirteen windows in certain rooms are due to Winchester&#x27;s apparent fascination with the number thirteen. However, according to carpenter James Perkins, these items and “the more irregular features, which have made the house a world-famed oddity were built after Mrs. Winchester&#x27;s death.” The first time that this apparent superstition appeared was in an article printed in 1929. Subsequently, it has been mentioned in most articles about Winchester and her house.

===Nightly séances===
Winchester&#x27;s staff, who spent every day with her, stated she had no interest in séances and there is no record of them being held in the house. Nevertheless, a false urban legend has arisen claiming she held nightly séances in the blue room or in a closet by herself from midnight until two in the morning, talking to ghosts about what construction should be accomplished the following day. In addition to the lack of records found about seances at Llanada Villa, the closet séances were unlikely given that they were usually social events and not done by individuals and records show that the blue room was the gardener&#x27;s bedroom.

===Hauntings===
Visitors and tour guides claim to have experienced cold spots, footsteps, cooking smells, odd sounds, whispering, doors and windows slamming, and feelings of being watched. Investigator Joe Nickell explains that they could be the result of confirmation bias and suggestibility due to publicity and rumors that the house is the most haunted house in the United States or even the world; or that over a thousand ghosts reside in the home. Nickell reports one example where a shadowy figure thought to be a ghost turned out to be a staff member at the house. According to Nickell, there is no evidence that the house is haunted, and that alleged whispering sounds can be imagined or due to wind. Additionally, it is common for large, rambling, and drafty old houses to have temperature variations, and the house&#x27;s settling and exterior temperature changes can explain odd noises.

<text>Jena Laine Malone (; born November 21, 1984) is an American actress. Born in Sparks, Nevada, Malone spent her early life there and in Las Vegas, while her mother acted in local theater productions. Inspired to become an actress herself, Malone convinced her mother to relocate to Los Angeles. After a series of auditions, Malone was cast in the television film &quot;Bastard Out of Carolina&quot; (1996), for which she received Independent Spirit and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and the television film &quot;Hope&quot; (1997), for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination. She next appeared in the feature films &quot;Contact&quot; (1997) and &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998), winning a Saturn Award for the former.

Malone began the 2000s with the independent psychological thriller &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001), which became a cult film. She next appeared in the drama film &quot;Life as a House&quot; and the miniseries &quot;&quot; (both 2003), and the dark comedy film &quot;Saved!&quot; (2004), and established herself as an adult with the historical drama film &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005). She furthered this success with the drama films &quot;The Ballad of Jack and Rose&quot; (2005) and &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007), and the horror film &quot;The Ruins&quot; (2008). She made her foray into action films with Zack Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Sucker Punch&quot; (2011), and earned her highest-grossing releases with the role of Johanna Mason in &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film series (2013–2015) which won her a Teen Choice Award. 

Malone has since appeared in the horror films &quot;The Neon Demon&quot; (2016), &quot;Antebellum&quot; (2020), &quot;Swallowed&quot; (2022) and &quot;Consecration&quot; (2023), the thriller films &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; (2016) and &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; (2024), the drama films &quot;The Public&quot; (2018) and &quot;Lorelei&quot; (2020) which she executive produced, and the Western film &quot;&quot; (2024). Her continued television credits include the crime dramas &quot;Too Old to Die Young&quot; (2019) and &quot;Goliath&quot; (2021).

== Early life ==
Malone was born on November 21, 1984, in Sparks, Nevada, the daughter of Deborah Malone and Edward Berge. Her father is of partly Norwegian descent; she also has Irish ancestry. According to Malone, her mother became pregnant with her after a one-night stand with her father, who was married to another woman at the time. Malone was raised by her mother and her mother&#x27;s girlfriend. &quot;They were lovers,&quot; Malone has said. &quot;I had two moms, and it was awesome.&quot; She remained estranged from her father for much of her early life but reconciled with him in adulthood.

Malone grew up impoverished; her family relocated frequently and at times was homeless. &quot;We were just so poor,&quot; Malone has said. &quot;We&#x27;d hop out of apartments, lose jobs, find a cheaper place, get kicked out, live in cars, and live in hotels.&quot; By the time she was nine years old, she had lived in 27 locations. Despite the frequent moves, Malone said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was a tough childhood...  it prepared me for this strange, gypsy lifestyle of an actor. It&#x27;s a beautiful thing to give children diversity of where to live and how to live; it makes you believe that security is built within instead of four concrete walls that you call a home.&quot;

As a child, Malone first began taking an interest in acting while watching her mother perform in community theater in the Lake Tahoe area. In 1995 she moved to Las Vegas, where she resided with her family for nine months, and began taking acting classes while her mother worked in a call center. She subsequently persuaded her mother to move to Los Angeles so she could pursue an acting career. Malone has said that she and her mother struggled financially in Los Angeles. She was home-schooled from sixth to eighth grade and attended the Professional Children&#x27;s School in New York City for ninth grade. She has one younger maternal half-sibling, Madison Mae Malone (born 1997). After dropping out of high school in 1999, Malone obtained a General Educational Development certificate in 2001.

== Career ==
=== 1990s ===
Malone progressed to professional acting with the film &quot;Bastard Out of Carolina&quot; (1996). She was nominated at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Debut Performance and at the third Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries for her role in the film. From there her roles grew to include several Hollywood features. In 1997 she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film for her role in the television film &quot;Hope&quot; (1997), portraying a young girl growing up in a small town in the 1960s.

After completing &quot;Hope,&quot; Malone was cast in Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Contact&quot; (1997), playing the child counterpart of Jodie Foster&#x27;s lead character. For her portrayal she won a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor. In 1998, she played the role of an unwed mother who is suspected of murdering her newborn baby in an episode of . The following year Malone was cast opposite Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris in the drama &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998), playing an adolescent girl whose father has remarried and whose mother is dying of terminal cancer. The film was a box office success, grossing over $150 million against a $50 million budget. Malone played Heather Aubrey, the teenage daughter of Kelly Preston in the 1999 movie, &quot;For Love of the Game&quot;, starring Kevin Costner.

=== 2000s ===
Malone had her first cinematic leading role in the psychological science fiction thriller film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001), playing Gretchen Ross, the new girl in town who becomes the girlfriend of Jake Gyllenhaal&#x27;s title character. Though the film was not a box-office hit, it later gained notoriety as a cult film. The same year she had a supporting part in the drama &quot;Life as a House&quot; (2001), portraying the girlfriend of a young man (Hayden Christensen) whose ailing father (Kevin Kline) is building a home. Malone co-produced the independent comedy-drama &quot;American Girl&quot; (2002), the first feature in which she had top billing, co-starring with Brad Renfro and Alicia Witt as a suicidal young woman whose father is in prison. In 2002 Malone played the part of a Catholic schoolgirl with a painful secret opposite Emile Hirsch in &quot;The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys&quot;, also featuring Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio and Jodie Foster. In 2003, Jena appeared as &quot;ferry girl&quot; in &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;.

Malone had top billing in the dark comedy &quot;Saved!&quot; (2004), in which she portrayed a Christian high school student who discovers her boyfriend is gay. The same year she starred in the ecological-themed independent thriller film &quot;Corn&quot;, about a young woman who returns to her family&#x27;s farm to find that their sheep are being driven mad by corn modified to be immune to pesticides. Ronnie Scheib of &quot;Variety&quot; praised her performance, writing: &quot;With &quot;Corn&quot; Jena Malone proves conclusively that she can carry a movie.&quot;

Malone was subsequently cast as Lydia Bennet in Joe Wright&#x27;s adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (2005). Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Malone, as the saucy, boy-crazy youngest daughter, Lydia, offers an amusing caricature of teenage idiocy and entitlement.&quot; The same year she had a supporting role in Rebecca Miller&#x27;s drama &quot;The Ballad of Jack and Rose&quot;.

In 2006 Malone made her Broadway stage debut as Sister James in a production of the Tony Award-winning play &quot;&quot;. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Malone &quot;slides effortlessly and appealingly into the part of the dewy, impressionable Sister James.&quot; She also appeared in films, co-starring with Chloë Sevigny in filmmaker M. Blash&#x27;s improvised feature &quot;Lying&quot; (2006), playing one of several women attending a precarious weekend gathering. Malone followed this with supporting roles in the independent comedy &quot;The Go-Getter&quot; (2007), playing a young woman reunited with her middle school crush, and the biographical drama &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007), in which she portrayed the sister of Chris McCandless.

In 2007 it was announced that Malone was releasing her first single on The Social Registry, a New York City experimental music label, as Jena Malone and the Bloodstains. A number of tracks were subsequently posted to her MySpace page. Pitchfork Media has described Malone&#x27;s music as &quot;pretty out-there—bedroom electronics, spaced-out keyboards, and Malone&#x27;s spare vocals.&quot; In 2008 she formed the musical project The Shoe, which features Malone performing with a series of electronic instruments contained within a steamer trunk. She began performing impromptu live shows on street corners in 2008.

Malone appeared in the supernatural horror film &quot;The Ruins&quot; (2008) opposite Shawn Ashmore and Jonathan Tucker, playing one of several backpackers in Mexico who become trapped on a Mayan temple teeming with vines that can animate and attack those who come into contact with them. The following year she returned to theater, portraying Lavinia in an off-Broadway revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot;, opposite Lili Taylor.

=== 2010s ===

In 2011 Malone played the role of Rocket in Zack Snyder&#x27;s action film &quot;Sucker Punch&quot;. The film&#x27;s commercial failure caused Malone to reevaluate her career and consider focusing on photography and music. After the success of her next role, in The History Channel&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Hatfields and McCoys&quot;, Malone&#x27;s passion for acting returned.

In 2012 Malone starred in &quot;Dakota&quot;, a series on the YouTube channel Wigs, portraying the title character. She was attached to play Carson McCullers in the film &quot;Lonely Hunter&quot;, directed by Deborah Kampmeir, and had a supporting role in Brian Savelson&#x27;s independent drama &quot;In Our Nature&quot; (2012) opposite Zach Gilford, Gabrielle Union, and John Slattery, playing one of several young people on a couples&#x27; getaway.

In 2013 Malone reunited with M. Blash and co-star Chloë Sevigny in the independent drama &quot;The Wait&quot;, portraying the sister of a woman who believes their dead mother will be resurrected. The same year she was cast as Johanna Mason in &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot;.

In 2014 Malone exhibited 39 photographs she had taken in Myanmar that summer. The exhibition, which ran from November 21 to 28, was called &quot;The Holy Other.&quot; It took place at MAMA, an art gallery owned by Malone&#x27;s friend Adarsha Benjamin in Downtown Los Angeles. Proceeds were donated to Girl Determined, a nonprofit organization that benefits girls&#x27; education in Myanmar. Also in 2014 Malone had a supporting role in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s neo-noir film &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2014), portraying an ex-heroin addict who hires a detective (Joaquin Phoenix) to find her husband. Malone also reprised the role of Johanna Mason in two &quot;Hunger Games&quot; sequels, &quot;Mockingjay – Part 1&quot; (2014) and &quot;Mockingjay – Part 2&quot; (2015).

Malone was cast as Jenet Klyburn in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;. Many sources reported that she was going to portray Carrie Kelley, but her scenes were left out of the theatrical release. Later, Snyder revealed that Carrie Kelley was in a deleted scene of the film, but she was not portrayed by Malone. In February 2015 Malone was cast alongside Elle Fanning in Nicolas Winding Refn&#x27;s horror film &quot;The Neon Demon&quot;, which focuses on an aspiring model in Los Angeles. The film garnered criticism for a scene in which Malone engages in necrophilia. &quot;The Telegraph&quot;″s Tim Robey deemed it the &quot;most offensive film of the year&quot; but conceded it was not &quot;any fault of Malone&#x27;s, who commits herself utterly to making it an anguished, desperate, if inevitably revolting minute or so of screen time. It&#x27;s a question of context, and how this scene...  slots into the film&#x27;s overall thesis.&quot;

Malone co-starred with Riley Keough in So Yong Kim&#x27;s drama film &quot;Lovesong&quot; (2016), playing a young woman who falls in love with her female best friend. Kate Erbland of IndieWire wrote that &quot;Malone is at her most effervescent and appealing&quot; but that &quot;the overall effect is one of a disjointed love story that can never quite find the tune, no matter how skilled its players.&quot;

Malone is credited as co-writer and featured vocalist on the Foster the People track &quot;Static Space Lover&quot; from the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Sacred Hearts Club&quot;, released on July 21, 2017. She appeared in the movies &quot;Stardust&quot; and &quot;The Tuna Goddess&quot;. In 2018, she appeared in the film &quot;The Public&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1999, at age 15, Malone filed for legal emancipation from her mother in a Los Angeles County Court, and subsequently alleged that her mother had mismanaged her earnings, spending $280,000 of her trust account. She was granted legal emancipation in January 2000.

In 2003, at age 19, Malone purchased a home in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where she resided as of 2012. 

In 2014, Malone began a relationship with photographer Ethan DeLorenzo. In May 2016, the couple&#x27;s son was born. Malone dealt with postpartum depression following the birth. Malone and DeLorenzo announced their engagement on August 30, 2016. In 2019, Malone and DeLorenzo ended their relationship. She has been in a relationship with musician Alex Ebert as of 2019.

Malone endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 United States presidential election.

In 2022, Malone helped rescue a dog that was being abused by its owner, and donated to a GoFundMe campaign to cover the costs of its surgery. 

In August 2022, Malone publicly came out as pansexual and polyamorous. 

In March 2023, Malone disclosed having been sexually assaulted while working on &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; franchise; Malone shared a photo to Instagram that she took after filming wrapped on the series&#x27; fourth and final film, &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2&quot;. In the comments section, Malone explained she had chosen not to name her alleged assailant because of concern about &quot;cancel-like culture&quot;.

<doc id="268145" wikidata="Q1110301" url="?curid=268145" title="Y-Δ transform">
<text>In circuit design, the Y-Δ transform, also written wye-delta and also known by many other names, is a mathematical technique to simplify the analysis of an electrical network. The name derives from the shapes of the circuit diagrams, which look respectively like the letter Y and the Greek capital letter Δ. This circuit transformation theory was published by Arthur Edwin Kennelly in 1899. It is widely used in analysis of three-phase electric power circuits. 

The Y-Δ transform can be considered a special case of the star-mesh transform for three resistors. In mathematics, the Y-Δ transform plays an important role in theory of circular planar graphs.

==Names==

The Y-Δ transform is known by a variety of other names, mostly based upon the two shapes involved, listed in either order. The Y, spelled out as wye, can also be called T or star; the Δ, spelled out as delta, can also be called triangle, Π (spelled out as pi), or mesh. Thus, common names for the transformation include wye-delta or delta-wye, star-delta, star-mesh, or T-Π. 

==Basic Y-Δ transformation==

The transformation is used to establish equivalence for networks with three terminals. Where three elements terminate at a common node and none are sources, the node is eliminated by transforming the impedances. For equivalence, the impedance between any pair of terminals must be the same for both networks. The equations given here are valid for complex as well as real impedances. Complex impedance is a quantity measured in ohms which represents resistance as positive real numbers in the usual manner, and also represents reactance as positive and negative imaginary values.

===Equations for the transformation from Δ to Y===
The general idea is to compute the impedance formula_1 at a terminal node of the Y circuit with impedances formula_2, formula_3 to adjacent nodes in the Δ circuit by

:formula_4

where formula_5 are all impedances in the Δ circuit. This yields the specific formula

:formula_6

===Equations for the transformation from Y to Δ===
The general idea is to compute an impedance formula_5 in the Δ circuit by

:formula_8

where formula_9 is the sum of the products of all pairs of impedances in the Y circuit and formula_10 is the impedance of the node in the Y circuit which is opposite the edge with formula_5. The formulae for the individual edges are thus

:formula_12

Or, if using admittance instead of resistance:
:formula_13

Note that the general formula in Y to Δ using admittance is similar to Δ to Y using resistance.

==A proof of the existence and uniqueness of the transformation==
The feasibility of the transformation can be shown as a consequence of the superposition theorem for electric circuits. A short proof, rather than one derived as a corollary of the more general star-mesh transform, can be given as follows. The equivalence lies in the statement that for any external voltages (formula_14 and formula_15) applying at the three nodes (formula_16 and formula_17), the corresponding currents (formula_18 and formula_19) are exactly the same for both the Y and Δ circuit, and vice versa. In this proof, we start with given external currents at the nodes. According to the superposition theorem, the voltages can be obtained by studying the superposition of the resulting voltages at the nodes of the following three problems applied at the three nodes with current:

# formula_20
# formula_21 and
# formula_22

The equivalence can be readily shown by using Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws that formula_23. Now each problem is relatively simple, since it involves only one single ideal current source. To obtain exactly the same outcome voltages at the nodes for each problem, the equivalent resistances in the two circuits must be the same, this can be easily found by using the basic rules of series and parallel circuits:

:formula_24

Though usually six equations are more than enough to express three variables (formula_25) in term of the other three variables(formula_26), here it is straightforward to show that these equations indeed lead to the above designed expressions.

In fact, the superposition theorem establishes the relation between the values of the resistances, the uniqueness theorem guarantees the uniqueness of such solution.

==Simplification of networks==
Resistive networks between two terminals can theoretically be simplified to a single equivalent resistor (more generally, the same is true of impedance). Series and parallel transforms are basic tools for doing so, but for complex networks such as the bridge illustrated here, they do not suffice. 

The Y-Δ transform can be used to eliminate one node at a time and produce a network that can be further simplified, as shown. 

The reverse transformation, Δ-Y, which adds a node, is often handy to pave the way for further simplification as well.

Every two-terminal network represented by a planar graph can be reduced to a single equivalent resistor by a sequence of series, parallel, Y-Δ, and Δ-Y transformations. However, there are non-planar networks that cannot be simplified using these transformations, such as a regular square grid wrapped around a torus, or any member of the Petersen family.

==Graph theory==
In graph theory, the Y-Δ transform means replacing a Y subgraph of a graph with the equivalent Δ subgraph. The transform preserves the number of edges in a graph, but not the number of vertices or the number of cycles. Two graphs are said to be Y-Δ equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a series of Y-Δ transforms in either direction. For example, the Petersen family is a Y-Δ equivalence class.

==Demonstration==
===Δ-load to Y-load transformation equations===
To relate formula_27 from Δ to formula_28 from Y, the impedance between two corresponding nodes is compared. The impedance in either configuration is determined as if one of the nodes is disconnected from the circuit.
The impedance between &quot;N&quot;1 and &quot;N&quot;2 with &quot;N&quot;3 disconnected in Δ:

:formula_29

To simplify, let formula_30 be the sum of formula_27.
:formula_32

Thus,

:formula_33

The corresponding impedance between N1 and N2 in Y is simple:

:formula_34

hence:

:formula_35   (1)

Repeating for formula_36:

:formula_37   (2)

and for formula_38:

:formula_39   (3)

From here, the values of formula_28 can be determined by linear combination (addition and/or subtraction).

For example, adding (1) and (3), then subtracting (2) yields

:formula_41

For completeness:

:formula_42 (4)
:formula_43 (5)
:formula_44 (6)

===Y-load to Δ-load transformation equations===
Let 

:formula_45.

We can write the Δ to Y equations as

:formula_46   (1)
:formula_47   (2)
:formula_48   (3)

Multiplying the pairs of equations yields

:formula_49   (4)
:formula_50   (5)
:formula_51   (6)

and the sum of these equations is

:formula_52   (7)

Factor formula_53 from the right side, leaving formula_30 in the numerator, canceling with an formula_30 in the denominator.

:formula_56 (8)

Note the similarity between (8) and {(1), (2), (3)}

Divide (8) by (1)

:formula_57

which is the equation for formula_58. Dividing (8) by (2) or (3) (expressions for formula_59 or formula_60) gives the remaining equations.

==Δ to Y transformation of a practical generator==

During the analysis of balanced three-phase power systems, usually an equivalent per-phase (or single-phase) circuit is analyzed instead due to its simplicity. For that, equivalent wye connections are used for generators, transformers, loads and motors. The stator windings of a practical delta-connected three-phase generator, shown in the following figure, can be converted to an equivalent wye-connected generator, using the six following formulas:

formula_61

The resulting network is the following. The neutral node of the equivalent network is fictitious, and so are the line-to-neutral phasor voltages. During the transformation, the line phasor currents and the line (or line-to-line or phase-to-phase) phasor voltages are not altered.

If the actual delta generator is balanced, meaning that the internal phasor voltages have the same magnitude and are phase-shifted by 120° between each other and the three complex impedances are the same, then the previous formulas reduce to the four following:

formula_62

where for the last three equations, the first sign (+) is used if the phase sequence is positive/&quot;abc&quot; or the second sign (−) is used if the phase sequence is negative/&quot;acb&quot;.

<text>Frederick Charles Slack (August 7, 1910 – August 10, 1965) was an American swing and boogie-woogie pianist and bandleader.

==Life and career==
Slack was born in Westby, Wisconsin, United States. He learned to play drums as a boy. Later he took up the xylophone, and at the age of 13 he changed to the piano. He studied with a local teacher throughout high school. At the age of 17, he moved with his parents to Chicago, where he continued his musical training. He met Rosy McHargue, a well-known clarinetist, who took him to hear many leading musicians, including Bix Beiderbecke and Earl Hines. His first job was with Johnny Tobin at the Beach View Gardens. He later moved to Los Angeles, where he worked with Henry Halstead, Earl Burtnett and Lennie Hayton, before joining Ben Pollack in 1934.

He played with the Jimmy Dorsey Band in the 1930s and was a charter member of the Will Bradley Orchestra when it formed in 1939. Known to bandmates as &quot;Daddy Slack,&quot; he played the piano solo on Bradley&#x27;s recording of &quot;Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar&quot;, one of the early white boogie-woogie hits and a classic of the big band era.

He formed his own band in 1942 and signed with the newly founded Capitol Records. He recorded three songs at his third recording session for Capitol, on May 21, 1942. His recording of &quot;Cow Cow Boogie,&quot; sung by the 17-year-old Ella Mae Morse, was the second record the new Capitol issued, on July 1, and by July 25 it had reached number 1 on the hit parade. It was Capitol&#x27;s first gold single.

T-Bone Walker was a member of Slack&#x27;s band from 1942 to 1944, and Slack later accompanied Walker on his first solo recording for Capitol, &quot;Mean Old World&quot;.
This band also had a hit with &quot;Strange Cargo.&quot;

Slack continued to record with Capitol until at least 1950, recording some 80 tracks for the label.

Slack also recorded as an accompanist for Big Joe Turner, Johnny Mercer, Margaret Whiting and Lisa Morrow.

In the original version of the song &quot;Down the Road a Piece&quot;, recorded in 1940 by the Will Bradley Orchestra, Slack is mentioned in the lyrics:
If you wanna&#x27; hear some boogie then I know the place&lt;BR&gt;
It&#x27;s just an old piano and a knocked-out bass.&lt;BR&gt;

The drummer-man&#x27;s a guy they call eight beat Mack&lt;BR&gt;
You remember Doc and old &quot;Beat Me Daddy&quot; Slack.&lt;BR&gt;

Man it&#x27;s better than chicken fried in bacon grease&lt;BR&gt;
Come along with me boy, it&#x27;s just down the road a piece.&lt;BR&gt;

&quot;Eight Beat Mack&quot; refers to drummer Ray McKinley, and &quot;Doc&quot; relates to the band&#x27;s bass player, Doc Goldberg.

His 1955 album, &quot;Boogie Woogie on the 88&quot;, featured a horn section including jazz musicians Shorty Sherock and Herbie Harper among others, with arrangements by Benny Carter.

He also co-wrote the 1945 classic &quot;The House of Blue Lights&quot;, first recorded with singer Ella Mae Morse, and later by Chuck Miller, the Andrews Sisters, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Asleep at the Wheel.

On August 10, 1965, Slack was found dead in his bedroom in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, from undetermined causes.

<text>Ernst Friedrich Christoph &quot;Fritz&quot; Sauckel (27 October 1894 – 16 October 1946) was a German Nazi politician, &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Gau Thuringia from 1927 and the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment (&quot;Arbeitseinsatz&quot;) from March 1942 until the end of the Second World War. Sauckel was among the 24 persons accused in the Nuremberg Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal. He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, sentenced to death, and executed by hanging.

==Early years ==
Born in Haßfurt (Kingdom of Bavaria), as the only child of a postman and a seamstress. Sauckel attended the local &quot;volksschule&quot; and the gymnasium in Schweinfurt, leaving in 1909 without graduating when his mother fell ill. He joined the merchant marine of Norway and Sweden when he was 15, first on a Norwegian three-masted schooner, and later on Swedish and German vessels. Starting off as a cabin boy, he went on to sail throughout the world, rising to the rank of &quot;Vollmatrose&quot; (able seaman). At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was on a German vessel &quot;en route&quot; to Australia when the vessel was captured by French naval forces. He was subsequently interned as an enemy alien in France from August 1914 until 20 October 1919. While interned, he studied mathematics, languages and economics.

When released, he returned to Germany and found factory work for the next few years in Schweinfurt as an apprentice locksmith and toolmaker in the ball-bearing works. In 1919 he joined the &quot;Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund &quot;, the largest and most influential anti-Semitic organization in Weimar Germany. He served as its local manager for Lower Franconia until 1921. Moving to Thuringia, he studied engineering at a technical school in Ilmenau
from 1922 to 1923, but was expelled for his political activities.

==Nazi career==
Sauckel joined the  Nazi Party (NSDAP) in January 1923 (member 1,395) and cofounded an &quot;Ortsgruppe&quot; (Local Group) in Ilmenau, serving as its &quot;Ortsgruppenführer&quot;. He also enrolled in the SA, the party’s paramilitary organization. He planned a “March on Berlin” with about 80 followers in conjunction with Adolf Hitler’s Beer Hall Putsch in Munich on 9 November 1923. However, he and 22 followers were arrested and briefly detained in Coburg before the march could get under way. Despite the forced dissolution of the party in the wake of the failed &quot;putsch&quot;, Sauckel remained active in political activities, establishing a right wing organization called &quot;Bund Teja&quot;, giving speeches, founding an SA front organization in Thuringia named &quot;Deutscher Wanderverein&quot; and serving as the &quot;Bezirksleiter&quot; (District Leader) for Thuringian Forest. He also became in 1924 the publisher of a small newspaper in Ilmenau, which in 1925 would merge with another paper and develop into the official organ of the Party in Thuringia, &quot;Der Nationalsozialist&quot;. Published in Weimar, he would serve as its editor from 1927 until 1945. Sauckel thus established his credentials as an &quot;Alter Kämpfer&quot; (old fighter) with whom Hitler always retained strong bonds of loyalty. In 1924 he married Elisabeth Wetzel, with whom he had ten children. 

After the ban on the party was lifted, Sauckel became the business manager for Gau Thuringia under &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Artur Dinter in March 1925 and formally rejoined the party on 6 April. On 6 February 1927, he was also named Deputy &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and Gau &quot;Organisationsleiter&quot;, in charge of personnel issues. Sauckel succeeded Dinter as &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Thuringia on 30 September 1927 and would retain this position until the end of the Nazi regime.

On 8 December 1929, Sauckel was elected to the Landtag of Thuringia as one of six Nazi deputies that would hold the balance of power there between the leftist (24) and center-right (23) parties. On 23 January 1930, a coalition government took office in Thuringia which for the first time in Germany included Nazi ministers, Wilhelm Frick and Willy Marschler. Sauckel, though not included as a State cabinet minister, became the leader of the Nazi faction in the &quot;Landtag&quot;. Following the 31 July 1932 election, the Nazis captured 42.5% of the votes and 26 seats, and Sauckel became the new Leading Minister of State (equivalent to Minister-President) as well as the interior minister from which portfolio he controlled all the State police and security apparatus.

Following Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, Sauckel was appointed to the new position of &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich Governor) of Thuringia on 5 May 1933, a post he would retain until May 1945. The new post was created to provide more centralized control over the State governments. On 8 May he left the Thuringian cabinet and was succeeded by Willy Marschler. On 9 November 1933 Sauckel was promoted to SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; and on 12 November he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 12 (Thuringia). 
On 9 September 1934, Sauckel joined the SS as an SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; at the invitation of Heinrich Himmler and was assigned to SS-&quot;Oberabschnitte Mitte&quot; (Senior Section Central) based in Weimar until 1 April 1936 when he was transferred to the staff of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;. Upon the death of Wilhelm Friedrich Loeper Sauckel was appointed to succeed him as the acting &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; of both Anhalt and Brunswick from 30 November 1935 to 20 April 1937. On 23 January 1937 Sauckel was made the head of the Main Office for the Four Year Plan in Thuringia. He was also given an honorary rank of &quot;SA-Obergruppenführer&quot; on 9 November 1937.

===World War II===
At the start of World War II on 1 September 1939, Sauckel was named Reich Defense Commissioner (&quot;Reichsverteidigungskommissar&quot;) for &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; (Military District) IX headquartered in Kassel. This district comprised Gau Thuringia along with Gau Electoral Hesse, the eastern half of Gau Hesse-Nassau and smaller parts of four neighboring Gaue. In this position, he was entrusted with supervising civil defense measures over a large area, including air raid defenses and evacuations, as well as control over the war economy, rationing and suppression of the black market. On 16 November 1942, the jurisdiction of the Reich Defense Commissioners was changed from the &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; to the Gau level, and he remained Commissioner for only his Gau of Thuringia. A member of the SS since 1934, he was promoted to honorary &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; on 30 January 1942. He was a holder of the Golden Party Badge. 

=== General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment===
On 21 March 1942, Sauckel was appointed to the position for which he would be forever linked in history, General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment (&quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für den Arbeitseinsatz&quot;) on the recommendation of Martin Bormann.
Sauckel worked directly under &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring within the Four Year Plan Office, obtaining and allocating labour for German industry and agriculture. On 27 March 1942, Göring issued a decree naming Sauckel the Leader of the Department of Labor Allocation within the Four Year Plan. In response to increased demands for labour from German war industries, Hitler issued a decree on 30 September 1942 granting Sauckel extraordinary powers over both civil and military authorities in the occupied territories. His agents were authorized “to issue directives to the competent military and civilian authorities” to ensure an adequate supply of labourers. Sauckel therefore met the ever-increasing requirement for manpower with people from the occupied territories. Voluntary numbers were insufficient and forced civilian labour was introduced within a few months. Of an estimated five million foreign workers brought to Germany, only around 200,000 came voluntarily, according to a March 1944 statement by Sauckel introduced as evidence at Nuremberg. 

The majority of the acquired workers originated from the Eastern territories, especially in Poland and the Soviet Union where the methods used to gain workers were very harsh. The Army was used to pressgang local people and most were taken by force to the Reich. In addition to forced civilian labourers, Sauckel authorized the use of prisoners of war. Conditions of work were extremely poor and discipline severe, especially for concentration camp prisoners. All the latter were unpaid and provided with starvation rations, barely keeping those workers alive. Such slave labour was widely used in many German industries, including coal mining, steel making, and armaments manufacture. The use of forced and slave labour continually increased throughout the war, especially after Albert Speer, the Reichsminister of Armaments and War Production, in April 1942 brought about the formation of the Central Planning Board, which determined the labor requirements of industry, agriculture and all other components of the German war economy, and requisitioned that labor through Sauckel’s office. It has been estimated that over 12 million such laborers eventually were brought forcibly to Germany to work, often by brutal coercion.

===Final months of the war===
On 1 July 1944, following the division of the Prussian Province of Saxony, Sauckel was named &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; of the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; (Government District) Erfurt, which became part of Thuringia. On 25 September 1944, Sauckel was named leader of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; forces in his Gau. On 27 October 1944 he was given a cash award of 250,000 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; in honor of his 50th birthday and for his contributions to the Reich. On 10 April 1945, only a day after declaring Weimar a fortress city and exhorting his &quot;Volkssturm&quot; forces to resist the approaching American Army, Sauckel fled the city by car. After the end of the war, he was arrested in Salzburg by members of the US Army Counterintelligence Corps on 12 May 1945. He was interned in the 7th Army Interrogation Center in Augsburg, Camp King in Oberursel and, finally, in Nuremberg.

==Trial and execution==

On 20 November 1945, Sauckel was put on trial before the International Military Tribunal as a major war criminal. He was indicted on all four charges of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes and crimes against humanity. He defended the &quot;Arbeitseinsatz&quot; as &quot;nothing to do with exploitation. It is an economic process for supplying labour&quot;. He denied that it was slave labour or that it was common to deliberately work people to death (extermination by labour) or to mistreat them. Yet, documents put into evidence showed that he was complicit in exploiting the labourers:

Robert Servatius, Sauckel&#x27;s counsel, portrayed Sauckel as a representative of the labour classes of Germany; an earnest and unpretentious party man assiduously committed to promoting the collective utility of the working class. This portrait was contrary to that of Speer, whom Servatius juxtaposed against Sauckel as a technical genius and entrepreneurial administrator. Sauckel surmised that Speer bore greater legal and moral responsibility by virtue of the fact that the former merely met the demands of the latter, in accordance with protocol. This strategy did not yield to his favour, however, as the ratio in the final judgement against the respective defendants outlined that Speer&#x27;s tasks were numerous, with the forced labour program comprising only one facet of his ministerial responsibilities, while Sauckel was singularly responsible for his office as General Plenipotentiary.
Sauckel was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and was hanged at Nuremberg Prison on 16 October 1946, 11 days before his 52nd birthday after receiving Communion. His last words were recorded as &quot;Ich sterbe unschuldig, mein Urteil ist ungerecht. Gott beschütze Deutschland. Möge es leben und eines Tages wieder groß werden. Gott beschütze meine Familie.&quot; (&quot;I die an innocent man, my sentence is unjust. God protect Germany. May it live and one day become great again. God protect my family.&quot;) Albert Speer escaped the death sentence and served 20 years at Spandau prison, one of the most controversial verdicts of the Nuremberg trials. The discrepancy of an effective subordinate facing death with the superior facing a prison sentence has faced much attention and criticism in historical analysis, including by Gitta Sereny, who later interviewed Speer concerning his responsibility for slave labour. 

Sauckel&#x27;s body, as were those of the other nine executed men and the corpse of Hermann Göring, was cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar.

<text>Donald Michael Ellison Foster, Baron Foster of Bath (born 31 March 1947), is a British politician and life peer who served as Government Deputy Chief Whip and Comptroller of the Household from 2013 to 2015. A member of the Liberal Democrats, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath from 1992 to 2015.

==Early life==
Foster was born in Preston, Lancashire, and attended the Lancaster Royal Grammar School before Keele University where he was awarded a BSc degree in physics and psychology in 1969, and also received the CertEd that same year. He later received an MEd in education at the University of Bath in 1981.

He was a science teacher at Sevenoaks School in Kent in 1969, before appointment as Avon Education Authority&#x27;s Science Project Director in 1975 and as a Lecturer in Education at Bristol University in 1980, before being engaged as a management consultant with Pannell Kerr Forster from 1989 until his election to the House of Commons.

==Parliamentary career==
A local party activist, he was a founder member of the Avon Liberal Democrats and was elected as a Councillor on Avon County Council in 1981 for Cabot Ward, and was the SDP–Liberal Alliance Group Leader from 1981 to 1986. He also served as the county&#x27;s education committee chairman, and remained a Councillor until 1989. He unsuccessfully contested Bristol East at the 1987 general election where he finished in third place, 11,659 votes behind the Conservative Jonathan Sayeed.

He was first elected in the constituency of Bath at the 1992 general election when he defeated then-Conservative Party Chairman, Chris Patten with a majority of 3,768. In his maiden speech on 12 May 1992, Foster spoke of the World Heritage Site status of Bath and sent his best wishes to Patten in Hong Kong.

In Parliament, Foster was the Liberal Democrat Spokesman for Education under the leadership of Paddy Ashdown in 1992, in which capacity he served until 1999.

In December 2010, in response to a call from the Football Supporters&#x27; Federation, he introduced a Bill in Parliament for English and Welsh football safe standing areas, the first of its kind since the Taylor Report.

Having been sworn of the Privy Council in 2010, in September 2012 Foster was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government before being promoted in October 2013 as Government Deputy Chief Whip representing the Liberal Democrats in the Coalition.

In January 2014, Foster announced he would stand down as an MP at the following general election. He was created Baron Foster of Bath, of Bath in the County of Somerset, in the 2015 Dissolution Honours, becoming a member of the House of Lords. His Bath constituency was won by the Conservatives at the 2015 general election and regained by the Liberal Democrats in 2017.

==Personal life==
His interests include Third World issues, being a member of Amnesty International and the Child Poverty Action Group as well as supporting a number of local charities, including Ted&#x27;s Big Day Out and Julian House. Lord Foster&#x27;s main national charity is WaterAid and he has seen first hand their work in Ethiopia. He is a Vice-President of the Debating Group, and also enjoys sport, music, ballet, travelling and reading; Lord Foster also plays the ukulele.

Foster was nominated for a life peerage in August 2015, despite having previously favoured abolition of the House of Lords. When accused of hypocrisy, Foster stated: &quot;I want to get rid of [the House of Lords] and the only way [to do that]...is having people there who will do just that.&quot;

<doc id="268162" wikidata="Q2070573" url="?curid=268162" title="Perfect hash function">
<text>In computer science, a perfect hash function for a set is a hash function that maps distinct elements in to a set of integers, with no collisions. In mathematical terms, it is an injective function.

Perfect hash functions may be used to implement a lookup table with constant worst-case access time. A perfect hash function can, as any hash function, be used to implement hash tables, with the advantage that no collision resolution has to be implemented. In addition, if the keys are not in the data and if it is known that queried keys will be valid, then the keys do not need to be stored in the lookup table, saving space.

Disadvantages of perfect hash functions are that needs to be known for the construction of the perfect hash function. Non-dynamic perfect hash functions need to be re-constructed if changes. For frequently changing dynamic perfect hash functions may be used at the cost of additional space. The space requirement to store the perfect hash function is in where is the number of keys in the structure.

The important performance parameters for perfect hash functions are the evaluation time, which should be constant, the construction time, and the representation size.

==Application==
A perfect hash function with values in a limited range can be used for efficient lookup operations, by placing keys from (or other associated values) in a lookup table indexed by the output of the function. One can then test whether a key is present in , or look up a value associated with that key, by looking for it at its cell of the table. Each such lookup takes constant time in the worst case. With perfect hashing, the associated data can be read or written with a single access to the table.

==Performance of perfect hash functions==
The important performance parameters for perfect hashing are the representation size, the evaluation time, the construction time, and additionally the range requirement formula_1 (average number of buckets per key in the hash table). The evaluation time can be as fast as , which is optimal. The construction time needs to be at least , because each element in needs to be considered, and contains elements. This lower bound can be achieved in practice.

The lower bound for the representation size depends on and . Let and a perfect hash function. A good approximation for the lower bound is formula_2 Bits per element. For minimal perfect hashing, , the lower bound is bits per element.

==Construction==
A perfect hash function for a specific set that can be evaluated in constant time, and with values in a small range, can be found by a randomized algorithm in a number of operations that is proportional to the size of S.
The original construction of uses a two-level scheme to map a set of elements to a range of indices, and then map each index to a range of hash values. The first level of their construction chooses a large prime (larger than the size of the universe from which is drawn), and a parameter , and maps each element of to the index
:formula_3
If is chosen randomly, this step is likely to have collisions, but the number of elements that are simultaneously mapped to the same index is likely to be small.
The second level of their construction assigns disjoint ranges of integers to each index . It uses a second set of linear modular functions, one for each index , to map each member of into the range associated with .

As show, there exists a choice of the parameter such that the sum of the lengths of the ranges for the different values of is . Additionally, for each value of , there exists a linear modular function that maps the corresponding subset of into the range associated with that value. Both , and the second-level functions for each value of , can be found in polynomial time by choosing values randomly until finding one that works.

The hash function itself requires storage space to store , , and all of the second-level linear modular functions. Computing the hash value of a given key may be performed in constant time by computing , looking up the second-level function associated with , and applying this function to .
A modified version of this two-level scheme with a larger number of values at the top level can be used to construct a perfect hash function that maps into a smaller range of length .

A more recent method for constructing a perfect hash function is described by as &quot;hash, displace, and compress&quot;. Here a first-level hash function is also used to map elements onto a range of integers. An element is stored in the Bucket .

Then, in descending order of size, each bucket&#x27;s elements are hashed by a hash function of a sequence of independent fully random hash functions , starting with . If the hash function does not produce any collisions for the bucket, and the resulting values are not yet occupied by other elements from other buckets, the function is chosen for that bucket. If not, the next hash function in the sequence is tested.

To evaluate the perfect hash function one only has to save the mapping σ of the bucket index onto the correct hash function in the sequence, resulting in .

Finally, to reduce the representation size, the ( are compressed into a form that still allows the evaluation in .

This approach needs linear time in for construction, and constant evaluation time. The representation size is in , and depends on the achieved range. For example, with achieved a representation size between 3.03 bits/key and 1.40 bits/key for their given example set of 10 million entries, with lower values needing a higher computation time. The space lower bound in this scenario is 0.88 bits/key.
===Pseudocode===
 algorithm &quot;hash, displace, and compress&quot; is
 (1) Split S into buckets 
 (2) Sort buckets Bi in falling order according to size |Bi|
 (3) Initialize array T[0...m-1] with 0&#x27;s
 (4) for all i∈[r], in the order from (2), do
 (5) for l←1,2...
 (6) repeat forming Ki←{l(x)|x∈Bi}
 (6) until |Ki|=|Bi| and Ki∩{j|T[j]=1}=&amp;emptyset;
 (7) let σ(i):= the successful l
 (8) for all j∈Ki let T[j]:=1
 (9) Transform (σi)0≤i&lt;r into compressed form, retaining access.

==Space lower bounds==
The use of words of information to store the function of is near-optimal: any perfect hash function that can be calculated in constant time
requires at least a number of bits that is proportional to the size of .

For minimal perfect hash functions the information theoretic space lower bound is
:formula_4
bits/key.

For perfect hash functions, it is first assumed that the range of is bounded by as . With the formula given by and for a universe formula_5 whose size tends towards infinity, the space lower bounds is
:formula_6
bits/key, minus bits overall.

==Extensions==
===Memory address identity===
A trivial but pervasive example of perfect hashing is implicit in the (virtual) memory address space of a computer. Since each byte of virtual memory is a distinct, unique, directly addressable storage location, the value of the starting address where any object is stored in memory can be considered a &quot;de facto&quot; perfect hash of that object into the entire memory address range.

===Dynamic perfect hashing===

Using a perfect hash function is best in situations where there is a frequently queried large set, , which is seldom updated. This is because any modification of the set may cause the hash function to no longer be perfect for the modified set. Solutions which update the hash function any time the set is modified are known as dynamic perfect hashing, but these methods are relatively complicated to implement.

===Minimal perfect hash function===
A minimal perfect hash function is a perfect hash function that maps keys to consecutive integers – usually the numbers from to or from to . A more formal way of expressing this is: Let and be elements of some finite set . Then is a minimal perfect hash function if and only if implies (injectivity) and there exists an integer such that the range of is . It has been proven that a general purpose minimal perfect hash scheme requires at least formula_7 bits/key. Assuming that formula_8 is a set of size formula_9 containing integers in the range formula_10, it is known how to efficiently construct an explicit minimal perfect hash function from formula_8 to formula_12 that uses space formula_13bits and that supports constant evaluation time. In practice, there are minimal perfect hashing schemes that use roughly 1.56 bits/key if given enough time.

===k-perfect hashing===
A hash function is -perfect if at most elements from are mapped onto the same value in the range. The &quot;hash, displace, and compress&quot; algorithm can be used to construct -perfect hash functions by allowing up to collisions. The changes necessary to accomplish this are minimal, and are underlined in the adapted pseudocode below:
 (4) for all i∈[r], in the order from (2), do
 (5) for l←1,2...
 (6) repeat forming Ki←{l(x)|x∈Bi}
 (6) until |Ki|=|Bi| and Ki∩{j|T[j]=k}=&amp;emptyset;
 (7) let σ(i):= the successful l
 (8) for all j∈Ki set T[j]←T[j]+1

===Order preservation===
A minimal perfect hash function is &quot;order preserving&quot; if keys are given in some order and for any keys and , implies . In this case, the function value is just the position of each key in the sorted ordering of all of the keys. A simple implementation of order-preserving minimal perfect hash functions with constant access time is to use an (ordinary) perfect hash function to store a lookup table of the positions of each key. This solution uses formula_14 bits, which is optimal in the setting where the comparison function for the keys may be arbitrary. However, if the keys are integers drawn from a universe formula_15, then it is possible to construct an order-preserving hash function using only formula_16 bits of space. Moreover, this bound is known to be optimal.

==Related constructions==

While well-dimensioned hash tables have amortized average O(1) time (amortized average constant time) for lookups, insertions, and deletion, most hash table algorithms suffer from possible worst-case times that take much longer.
A worst-case O(1) time (constant time even in the worst case) would be better for many applications (including network router and memory caches).

Few hash table algorithms support worst-case O(1) lookup time (constant lookup time even in the worst case). The few that do include: perfect hashing; dynamic perfect hashing; cuckoo hashing; hopscotch hashing; and extendible hashing.

A simple alternative to perfect hashing, which also allows dynamic updates, is cuckoo hashing. This scheme maps keys to two or more locations within a range (unlike perfect hashing which maps each key to a single location) but does so in such a way that the keys can be assigned one-to-one to locations to which they have been mapped. Lookups with this scheme are slower, because multiple locations must be checked, but nevertheless take constant worst-case time.
