<text>Jiang Wei (202 – 3 March 264), courtesy name Boyue, was a Chinese military general and politician 
of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Born in Ji County (present-day Gangu County, Gansu), Jiang Wei started his career as a military officer in his native Tianshui Commandery, which was a territory of Wei. In 228, when Wei&#x27;s rival state Shu launched an invasion led by Zhuge Liang, Jiang Wei was distrusted by Ma Zun, then administrator of Tianshui Commandery. As such, Jiang Wei had to defect to Shu. Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Shu, highly regarded Jiang Wei and appointed him as a general in Shu. After Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death in 234, Jiang Wei continued serving as a military commander during the regencies Jiang Wan and Fei Yi, eventually rising to the highest military rank of General-In-Chief (大將軍) after Fei Yi&#x27;s death in 253. Between 240 and 262, he continued Zhuge Liang&#x27;s legacy of waging war against Wei by leading another 11 military campaigns. However, Jiang Wei&#x27;s campaigns were relatively constrained in terms of both scale and duration due to Shu&#x27;s limited resources and inadequate food supplies, as well as internal political faultlines. In 263, when Wei launched a massive invasion of Shu, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to resist the invaders at Tazhong, Yinping and Jiange, himself defending Jiange which was under Zhong Hui&#x27;s attack. While Jiang Wei managed to temporarily stall Wei&#x27;s main force led by Zhong Hui, Deng Ai, another military commander of Wei, took a shortcut via Yinping and showed up at Chengdu unexpectedly. Liu Shan surrendered to Deng Ai without putting up resistance and ordered Jiang Wei to surrender to the Wei general Zhong Hui; this event marked the end of Shu&#x27;s existence. In the following year, Jiang Wei instigated Zhong Hui to launch a rebellion in Chengdu against the Wei regent Sima Zhao and hoped to use the opportunity to gain military power and restore Shu. However, some of Zhong Hui&#x27;s officers were unwilling to participate in the rebellion and started a mutiny, killing Jiang Wei and Zhong Hui.

==Family background==
Jiang Wei was from Ji County (冀縣/兾縣), Tianshui Commandery (天水郡), which is present-day Gangu County, Gansu. As his father died early, Jiang Wei grew up with his mother and was known for his interest in the writings of the Confucian scholar Zheng Xuan.

The &quot;Fu Zi&quot; recorded that Jiang Wei was a fame-seeking person with great ambitions. He also secretly raised a private militia.

==Early career in Wei==
Jiang Wei began his career in his native Tianshui Commandery, which was a territory of the state of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He started out as a clerk in charge of records and later became an assistant officer under the commandery administrator. After considering that his father died in service, the Wei government commissioned Jiang Wei as a &quot;zhonglang&quot; (中郎) and allowed him to participate in military affairs in Tianshui Commandery.

==Defection to Shu==
===&quot;Sanguozhi&quot; account===
In the spring of 228, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Wei&#x27;s rival state Shu, launched the first of a series of military campaigns against Wei. He occupied Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) and deployed his troops there in orderly formations. Three Wei-controlled commanderies – Nan&#x27;an (南安; around present-day Longxi County, Gansu), Tianshui and Anding (安定; around present-day Zhenyuan County, Gansu) – responded to the invasion by defecting to the Shu side.

Jiang Wei&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that at the time, Jiang Wei and his colleagues Liang Xu, Yin Shang and Liang Qian were out on an inspection tour with Ma Zun (馬遵), the Administrator of Tianshui Commandery. When Ma Zun learnt of the Shu invasion and heard that many counties in Tianshui Commandery had defected to the enemy, he suspected that Jiang Wei and the others were going to betray him so he fled overnight and took shelter in Shanggui County (上邽縣; within present-day Tianshui, Gansu).

By the time Jiang Wei and his colleagues realised that Ma Zun had abandoned them and fled on his own, they attempted to catch up with him but it was too late. They were denied entry when they showed up at Shanggui County, so Jiang Wei led them to his home county, Ji County (冀縣/兾縣; present-day Gangu County, Gansu). However, the official in charge of Ji County also refused to allow them to enter. Faced with no other choice, Jiang Wei and his colleagues surrendered and defected to Shu.

===Alternative account in the &quot;Weilüe&quot;===
The &quot;Weilüe&quot; recorded a different account of Jiang Wei&#x27;s defection from Wei to Shu.

At the time of the Shu invasion, Ma Zun and his subordinates (including Jiang Wei) were on an inspection tour with the Wei general Guo Huai when they received news that Zhuge Liang and the Shu army had occupied Mount Qi. After telling Ma Zun that Zhuge Liang was &quot;up to no good&quot;, Guo Huai wanted to quickly head back to Shanggui County in the east of Tianshui Commandery. Even though his headquarters was at Ji County in the west, Ma Zun did not want to go back because he feared that there would be unrest in Ji County in light of the Shu invasion. He decided to join Guo Huai and move to Shanggui County instead.

When Jiang Wei urged Ma Zun to return to Ji County, the latter told him and the others: &quot;If you go back, then you will become my enemy.&quot; Jiang Wei ignored Ma Zun because he was worried about the safety of his family in Ji County, so he parted ways with Ma Zun and returned to Ji County with his colleague Shangguan Zixiu (上官子脩) and others.

When Jiang Wei returned to Ji County, the people welcomed him back and insisted that he meet Zhuge Liang. Jiang Wei and Shangguan Zixiu relented and went to see Zhuge Liang, who was delighted to meet them. By the time Jiang Wei wanted to go back to Ji County to fetch his family members (mother, wife and child(ren)), Wei forces under Zhang He and Fei Yao had defeated the Shu vanguard at the Battle of Jieting. Unable to return to Ji County and left with no other option, Jiang Wei decided to defect to Shu and follow Zhuge Liang. After Wei forces recaptured Ji County, they took Jiang Wei&#x27;s family members captive but did not execute them because they knew that Jiang Wei did not originally intend to defect to the enemy. Jiang Wei&#x27;s family members thus spent the rest of their lives in prison.

==During Zhuge Liang&#x27;s regency==
After returning to Hanzhong Commandery, Zhuge Liang appointed Jiang Wei as an Assistant official in charge of food supplies (倉曹掾). Later, Jiang Wei was commissioned as General Who Upholds Righteousness (奉義將軍) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Dangyang Village (當陽亭侯).

Jiang Wei was subsequently promoted to the rank of General Who Attacks the West (征西將軍) and given the appointment of Central Army Supervisor (中監軍).

==During Jiang Wan&#x27;s regency==
Following Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains in the autumn of 234, Jiang Wei returned to the Shu capital Chengdu and was reassigned to serve as Right Army Supervisor (右監軍) with the rank of General Who Assists Han (輔漢將軍). He was put in command of Chengdu&#x27;s armed forces and promoted from a village marquis to a county marquis under the title &quot;Marquis of Pingxiang&quot; (平襄侯).

In 238, Jiang Wei accompanied the Shu regent Jiang Wan to Hanzhong Commandery near the Wei–Shu border. After Jiang Wan was appointed Grand Marshal (大司馬) in April or May 239, he appointed Jiang Wei as a Major (司馬) under him. He also put Jiang Wei in charge of a separate force to make incursions into Wei territory.

===First Northern Expedition===
In 240, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Longxi Commandery but was driven back by Wei forces under Guo Huai&#x27;s command.

Three years later, Jiang Wei was promoted to the rank of Senior General Who Guards the West (鎮西大將軍) and appointed as the nominal Inspector of Liang Province (涼州刺史).

==During Fei Yi&#x27;s regency==

Following Jiang Wan&#x27;s death in 246, Fei Yi became the regent of Shu.

A year later, Jiang Wei was promoted to General of the Guards (衞將軍). He also shared power with Fei Yi by jointly holding the office of Manager of the Affairs of the Masters of Writing (錄尚書事) with him.

In the same year, Jiang Wei suppressed a rebellion in Pingkang County (平康縣; southwest of present-day Songpan County, Sichuan).

===Second Northern Expedition===
In 247, the Qiang tribes started a rebellion against Wei in four commanderies in Yong and Liang provinces, and called for support from Shu. Baihuwen (白虎文) and Zhiwudai (治無戴), two tribal kings in Liang Province, responded by rebelling against Wei. When Jiang Wei led Shu forces into Liang Province to support the Qiang rebels, Baihuwen and Zhiwudai led their forces to join him.

In response, the Wei government sent Xiahou Ba and Guo Huai to lead troops to suppress the rebellion and repel the Shu invasion. Jiang Wei attacked Xiahou Ba&#x27;s position at the west of the Tao River but retreated back to Shu when Wei reinforcements led by Guo Huai showed up.

===Third Northern Expedition===
In 248, Jiang Wei led Shu forces from Shiying (石營; northwest of present-day Xihe County, Gansu) to Qiangchuan (彊川; west of present-day Lintan County, Gansu) to rendezvous with the tribal king Zhiwudai (治無戴), who had recently been defeated by the Wei general Guo Huai at Longyi County (龍夷縣; west of present-day Huangyuan County, Qinghai) He left his subordinate Liao Hua behind to guard the fortress at Chengzhong Mountain (成重山; located west of present-day Lintao County, Gansu).

Guo Huai split his army into two groups with the aim of preventing Jiang Wei from meeting up and combining forces with Zhiwudai. He led one group to attack Liao Hua at Chengzhong Mountain to force Jiang Wei to turn back to save Liao Hua. At the same time, he ordered his subordinate Xiahou Ba to attack Jiang Wei and push him back towards Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu). Guo Huai&#x27;s plan succeeded as Jiang Wei turned back to save Liao Hua when he learnt that Chengzhong Mountain was under attack. In doing so, he failed to meet up with Zhiwudai and eventually retreated back to Shu.

===Fourth Northern Expedition===
In the autumn of 249, after he was granted acting imperial authority by the Shu emperor Liu Shan, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Yong Province and gained support from the Qiang tribes. He had two fortresses constructed at Qushan (麴山; southeast of present-day Min County, Gansu).

In response to the Shu invasion, the Wei general Guo Huai ordered his subordinates Chen Tai, Xu Zhi and Deng Ai to besiege the two fortresses and cut off their supply routes.

When Jiang Wei led troops from Mount Niutou (牛頭山; west of present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan) to reinforce the two fortresses, Chen Tai led a Wei army to block his path. At the same time, Chen Tai sought help from Guo Huai, who led his troops across the Tao River to attack Jiang Wei&#x27;s base at Mount Niutou. Jiang Wei became fearful so he pulled back all his troops and abandoned the two fortresses.

Three days after his apparent retreat, Jiang Wei sent Liao Hua to lead a small force to distract Deng Ai at Baishui (白水; in present-day Qingchuan County, Sichuan) while he led the main army to attack Taocheng (洮城; northeast of present-day Min County, Gansu). Deng Ai saw through Jiang Wei&#x27;s ruse and immediately dispatched reinforcements to Taocheng. Jiang Wei failed to capture Taocheng as Deng Ai had already strengthened its defences so he withdrew all his troops and returned to Shu.

===Fifth expedition (250)===
In 250, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Xiping Commandery (西平郡; around present-day Xining, Qinghai). He retreated after failing to capture Xiping.

===Fei Yi&#x27;s opposition to Jiang Wei&#x27;s hawkish stance===
Jiang Wei believed that he was familiar with the culture of the Qiang and other non-Han Chinese tribes in western China, and had great confidence in his skills as a military leader. He often boasted that he could easily conquer the Wei-controlled lands in present-day Gansu if he had the support of the Qiang and non-Han Chinese tribes living in the region.

Fei Yi, however, disapproved of Jiang Wei&#x27;s hawkish stance and warmongering behaviour towards Wei, and attempted to rein him in by limiting the number of troops he led into battle each time to no more than 10,000.

The &quot;Han Jin Chunqiu&quot; (漢晉春秋) recorded that Fei Yi once told Jiang Wei: &quot;We aren’t as brilliant as the Imperial Chancellor. If even he can&#x27;t stabilise the Empire, what makes you think we can do it? Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to defend our state, govern our people well, respect and safeguard his legacy, and pass it on to future generations? Stop your wishful thinking that you can achieve victory in one fell swoop. If you fail, it will be too late for regrets.&quot;

===Fei Yi&#x27;s assassination===
On 16 February 253, Fei Yi was assassinated during a party on the first day of the Chinese New Year. The assassin, Guo Xiu (郭脩), was a Wei civilian captured in battle by Jiang Wei. After reluctantly surrendering to Shu, he attempted to assassinate Liu Shan but failed to get close to the emperor so he switched his target to Fei Yi and succeeded. Fei Yi&#x27;s death allowed Jiang Wei to gain greater control over the Shu military and continue waging war against Wei.

==Jiang Wei&#x27;s Northern Expeditions==

===Sixth Northern Expedition===
In the summer of 253, Jiang Wei led tens of thousands of Shu troops from Shiying (石營; northwest of present-day Xihe County, Gansu) to besiege Didao (狄道; around present-day Lintao County, Gansu). In response to the Shu invasion, the Wei regent Sima Shi ordered his generals Guo Huai and Chen Tai to lead the Wei forces stationed in the Guanzhong region to attack the invaders and lift the siege on Didao. Chen Tai attacked the Shu forces at Luomen (洛門; in present-day Wushan County, Gansu) and defeated them. Jiang Wei eventually withdrew all his forces and retreated back to Shu when they ran out of food supplies.

===Seventh Northern Expedition===
In the summer of 254, after the Shu government granted him authority to oversee internal and external military affairs, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Longxi Commandery again. Li Jian (李簡), the Wei official in charge of Didao (狄道; around present-day Lintao County, Gansu), surrendered to Jiang Wei. Jiang Wei then pressed further to attack Xiangwu County (襄武縣; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) and engaged the Wei general Xu Zhi in battle. Xu Zhi was defeated and killed, but the Shu army also lost a general, Zhang Ni. The victorious Shu forces then occupied three counties – Didao, Heguan (河關; in the vicinity of present-day Dingxi, Gansu) and Lintao – and forced the residents to relocate to Shu-controlled territory.

===Eighth Northern Expedition===
In 255, despite strong objection from a fellow Shu general Zhang Yi, Jiang Wei went ahead with another campaign against Wei and even brought along Zhang Yi as his deputy. As the massive Shu army prepared to attack Didao (狄道; present-day Lintao County, Gansu), Wang Jing, the Wei governor of Yong Province, sought help from the Wei general Chen Tai.

After suffering a disastrous defeat against Shu forces at the west bank of the Tao River, Wang Jing and his remaining men retreated to Didao and took shelter inside the fortress. When Jiang Wei wanted to take advantage of the momentum to press on and besiege Didao, Zhang Yi advised him to stop advancing further because they would risk losing everything they had gained so far. Jiang Wei ignored him and ordered his forces to surround Didao.

In the meantime, Chen Tai, Deng Ai, Sima Fu and other Wei officers led reinforcements to Didao to save Wang Jing. Chen Tai led his troops to the hills southeast of Didao, where they lit more fires and beat their war drums loudly to let the Wei forces in Didao know that reinforcements were on the way. As a result, the Wei forces in Didao experienced a surge in morale, and the Shu forces were taken by surprise. At the same time, Chen Tai also spread false news that they were planning to cut off the Shu army&#x27;s retreat route. When Jiang Wei heard about it, he became fearful so on 11 November 255 he withdrew all the Shu forces and retreated to Zhongti (鐘堤; south of present-day Lintao County, Gansu).

===Ninth Northern Expedition===
In the spring of 256, the Shu emperor Liu Shan promoted Jiang Wei to the position of General-in-Chief (大將軍). In autumn, Jiang Wei led Shu forces from Zhongti (鐘堤; south of present-day Lintao County, Gansu) to conquer Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) but failed because the Wei general Deng Ai had anticipated the attack and already set up strong defences. Jiang Wei then attacked Deng Ai at Mount Wucheng (武城山; in present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi) but was driven back. Later, he led his troops across the Wei River to launch a coordinated strike on Shanggui County (上邽縣; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu) with another Shu force led by Hu Ji. However, Hu Ji failed to show up in time so Jiang Wei came under attack by Deng Ai and his army sustained heavy casualties.

As the Northern Expeditions took a huge toll on Shu&#x27;s population and resources, the people increasingly resented Jiang Wei for his warmongering behaviour. In order to appease public anger, Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court to take full responsibility for the failure of the ninth Northern Expedition and requested to be demoted as punishment. Liu Shan approved Jiang Wei&#x27;s request and demoted him to the position of General of the Rear (後將軍) but allowed him to remain as acting General-in-Chief (大將軍).

===Tenth Northern Expedition===
In 257, when the Wei general Zhuge Dan started a rebellion in Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Jiang Wei decided to take advantage of the situation to stage another invasion of Wei. He led Shu forces to attack the Wei garrisons near the Great Wall which were well-stocked with supplies but poorly defended. The Wei forces stationed there started panicking when they heard of the Shu army&#x27;s approach.

The Wei generals Sima Wang and Deng Ai led separate armies to the Great Wall to resist the Shu invaders. Jiang Wei then retreated to Mangshui (芒水; southeast of present-day Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi) and set up a camp there with its back facing a mountain. When the Wei forces encircled his position, Jiang Wei tried to taunt them to attack his camp but Sima Wang and Deng Ai ordered their troops to ignore the enemy and refrain from attacking.

In 258, after Jiang Wei received news that Wei forces had suppressed Zhuge Dan&#x27;s rebellion, he withdrew his troops and returned to the Shu capital Chengdu. The Shu emperor Liu Shan restored him to the position of General-in-Chief (大將軍).

At the time, having seen year after year of battles against Wei, the people of Shu were growing tired of having to endure the costs and effects of war. The Shu official Qiao Zhou also wrote the &quot;Chou Guo Lun&quot; (仇國論; &quot;Disquisition on Rivalling States&quot;), a satirical piece criticising Jiang Wei for his warmongering behaviour.

===Eleventh Northern Expedition===
In the winter of 262, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to occupy Taoyang County (洮陽縣; in present-day Lintao County, Gansu) and attack Wei forces led by Deng Ai at Houhe County (侯和縣) but they lost the battle. He retreated to Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu) and garrisoned there.

===Huang Hao&#x27;s rise to power===
Jiang Wei knew that given his background as a defector from Wei, he had to prove his loyalty to Shu so he was eager to gain glory in battle. However, despite leading eleven campaigns against Wei, he had not made any significant achievements. While he was away at the frontline, the palace eunuch Huang Hao, whom the emperor Liu Shan favoured, gradually gained power in the Shu government and dominated the political scene. Huang Hao had a close partnership with the Shu general Yan Yu (閻宇) and he considered replacing Jiang Wei with Yan Yu as General-in-Chief. Jiang Wei had long suspected that Huang Hao had something against him so he remained in Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu) and did not return to Chengdu after the eleventh Northern Expedition.

The &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; recorded that Jiang Wei hated Huang Hao for his power-grabbing behaviour and once advised Liu Shan to execute the eunuch. However, Liu Shan refused and said: &quot;Huang Hao is but a servant running errands for me. In the past, I was annoyed by Dong Yun&#x27;s deep hatred of him. Sir, why do you need to take this so personally?&quot; Jiang Wei soon realised that he had a mistake in advising Liu Shan to execute Huang Hao because Huang Hao had strong influence in the Shu government, so he quickly excused himself and left. Liu Shan later instructed Huang Hao to visit Jiang Wei and apologise to him. Jiang Wei also managed to convince Huang Hao to let him remain in Tazhong to oversee agricultural production. His true intention, however, was to avoid getting caught up in a power struggle with Huang Hao in Chengdu.

==Fall of Shu==
===Jiang Wei&#x27;s early warnings===
In 263, Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to Liu Shan as follows: 

Huang Hao believed fortune-tellers&#x27; prediction that Wei would not invade Shu, so he advised Liu Shan to ignore Jiang Wei&#x27;s memorial and not put it up for discussion in the imperial court.

===From Tazhong to Yinping===
Around August or September 263, the Wei regent Sima Zhao ordered Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu to lead Wei forces to invade Shu from three different directions. When Zhong Hui reached Luo Valley (駱谷; southwest of present-day Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi) and Deng Ai attacked Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu), the Shu government ordered Liao Hua to lead reinforcements to support Jiang Wei at Tazhong. At the same time, they also sent Zhang Yi, Dong Jue and other Shu officers to lead troops to guard Yang&#x27;an Pass (陽安關; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi) and assist the Shu forces on the external perimeter.

When the Shu reinforcements reached Yinping (陰平; present-day Wen County, Gansu), they heard that Zhuge Xu was attacking Jianwei (建威; northeast of present-day Wudu District, Longnan, Gansu), so they stopped in their tracks at Yinping. After about a month, Deng Ai defeated Jiang Wei and occupied Tazhong, so Jiang Wei retreated to Yinping.

At the same time, Zhong Hui besieged Hancheng (漢城; present-day Mian County, Shaanxi) and Lecheng (樂城; present-day Chenggu County, Shaanxi) counties, and sent his subordinates to attack Yang&#x27;an Pass. The Shu officer Jiang Shu (蔣舒) opened up the pass and surrendered to the enemy, while his colleague Fu Qian died trying to defend the pass. After failing to take Lecheng County, Zhong Hui gave up and advanced towards Yang&#x27;an Pass when he learnt that his subordinates had captured the pass.

===Defence of Jiange===
By the time Zhang Yi and Dong Jue reached Hanshou County (漢壽縣; northeast of present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), Jiang Wei and Liao Hua had decided to abandon their position at Yinping and rendezvous with Zhang Yi and Dong Jue at the mountain pass Jiange, where they resisted attacks by Zhong Hui.

At one point, Zhong Hui wrote to Jiang Wei: &quot;Sir, you are skilled in both civil and military affairs. You are exceptionally brilliant in strategy and your achievements are well-known throughout the Bashu region and the rest of the Empire. People from near and afar admire you. Every time I reflect on history, I hope that we can serve the same dynasty. Our relationship is like the friendship between Jizha and Zichan.&quot;

Jiang Wei did not reply and ordered his troops to strengthen their defenses at Jiange. After failing to breach the mountain pass and with his army&#x27;s food supplies running low, Zhong Hui considered pulling back all his troops and retreating.

===Shu surrender===
In the meantime, Deng Ai and his troops took a shortcut from Yinping through mountainous terrain and showed up at Mianzhu, where they defeated the Shu defenders led by Zhuge Zhan. After taking Mianzhu, Deng Ai advanced further and approached Chengdu, the Shu capital. In late November or December 263, Liu Shan decided to surrender to Deng Ai, thus bringing an end to the existence of Shu.

When Jiang Wei first heard that Mianzhu had fallen, he also received confusing information about the situation in Chengdu. Some said that Liu Shan wanted to remain in Chengdu and defend the city, while others claimed that the Shu emperor was going to abandon Chengdu and flee south to Jianning Commandery (建寧郡; covering parts of present-day Yunnan and Guizhou). Jiang Wei thus prepared to abandon Jiange and lead his troops to Qi County (郪縣; present-day Santai County, Sichuan), which was nearer to Chengdu, to verify the truth.

Just then, Jiang Wei and his troops received orders from Chengdu to lay down their arms and surrender to Zhong Hui at Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). Many Shu soldiers felt so shocked and angry when they heard of their emperor&#x27;s surrender that they drew their swords and slashed at rocks to vent their frustration. When Zhong Hui finally met Jiang Wei, he asked him: &quot;Why are you late?&quot; With a solemn expression on his face and tears streaming down his cheeks, Jiang Wei replied: &quot;Our meeting today came too early.&quot; Zhong Hui was impressed by Jiang Wei&#x27;s response.

==Attempt to restore Shu==
===Instigating Zhong Hui to rebel against Wei===
Zhong Hui treated Jiang Wei well and returned him his tallies and other insignia. They travelled in the same carriage and sat at the same table during meals. Zhong Hui also told his chief clerk Du Yu: &quot;Famous people from the Central Plains like Gongxiu and Taichu can&#x27;t be compared to Boyue.&quot;

Jiang Wei sensed that Zhong Hui had the intention of rebelling against Wei and sought to exploit this opportunity to stage an uprising and restore Shu. He told Zhong Hui: 

Zhong Hui replied: &quot;What you just said is so far-off. I can&#x27;t do this. Besides, given my current situation, there isn&#x27;t a need for me to do this.&quot;

Jiang Wei then said: 

They became even closer friends after this.

===Death===
Zhong Hui then framed his fellow Wei general Deng Ai for plotting a rebellion and had him arrested and sent back to the Wei capital Luoyang as a prisoner. With Deng Ai gone, Zhong Hui had control over Chengdu and the former Shu territories. In March 264, he started a revolt against the Wei regent Sima Zhao and declared himself the Governor of Yi Province (益州牧).

Zhong Hui wanted to put Jiang Wei in command of 50,000 troops and let him lead the vanguard force to attack Luoyang. However, around noon on 3 March 264, some Wei officers who were unwilling to participate in the rebellion started a mutiny against Zhong Hui. At the time, Jiang Wei was collecting his armour and weapons from Zhong Hui when they heard shouting and received news that a fire had broken out. Moments later, it was reported that many soldiers were crowding near the city gates. Zhong Hui was surprised and he asked Jiang Wei: &quot;Those men are causing trouble. What should we do?&quot; Jiang Wei replied: &quot;Kill them.&quot;

Zhong Hui then ordered his men to kill the officers who refused to participate in the rebellion. A while later, there were reports of people climbing up the city gates on ladders and of people setting fire to buildings. Chaos broke out and arrows were fired in all directions. The mutinying officers regrouped with their men and attacked Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei. Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei fought the mutinying soldiers and slew about five or six of them, but were eventually overwhelmed and killed. The soldiers also killed Jiang Wei&#x27;s wife and child(ren). The &quot;Shiyu&quot; (世語) recorded that the soldiers sliced open Jiang Wei&#x27;s body when they killed him and saw that his gallbladder was one &quot;dou&quot; in size.

===Alternative account from the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot;===
The &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; recorded that Jiang Wei was only pretending to cooperate with Zhong Hui. He first instigated Zhong Hui to execute the Wei officers who were unwilling to join the rebellion, and then sought to find an opportunity to assassinate Zhong Hui. He would then lead the Shu people to kill all the Wei soldiers and restore their state. He also wrote a secret letter to Liu Shan as follows: 

==Family and descendants==
Jiang Wei&#x27;s father, Jiang Jiong (姜冏), served as a military officer in Tianshui Commandery and lost his life while suppressing a rebellion by the Qiang and other non-Han Chinese tribes.

Although Jiang Wei&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that he lost contact with his mother after defecting to Shu, the &quot;Zaji&quot; (雜記) recorded that after he later received a letter from his mother asking him to return home. He wrote a reply as follows: 

A genealogy book titled &quot;Da Tang Chi Xiulie Shan Siyue Tianshuijun Jiang Xing Gu Pu Zong Shixi&quot; (大唐敕修烈山四岳天水郡姜姓古譜總世系), dating from the Tang dynasty, recorded that Jiang Wei&#x27;s wife was a certain Lady Liu (柳氏).

The Tang dynasty general Jiang Baoyi (姜寶誼) and chancellor Jiang Ke (姜恪) were descendants of Jiang Wei according to the table of chancellors&#x27; family trees in the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;.

==Appraisal==
In his modern Chinese edition of the 11th-century historical text &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, the Taiwan-based Chinese historian Bo Yang mentioned that Jiang Wei was a highly controversial figure in Chinese history. He cited seven writers (Xi Zheng, Sun Sheng, Chen Shou, He Zhuo, Gan Bao, Wang Mingsheng and Pei Songzhi) who held different and discordant views of Jiang Wei.

Bo Yang himself, however, declined to comment but later shared in an open letter to a reader that he agreed with all seven views: Jiang Wei committed a fatal error in draining Shu&#x27;s resources but he was also a loyal general who was willing to sacrifice himself in a futile attempt to restore Shu.

===Zhuge Liang&#x27;s views===
Zhuge Liang once told Zhang Yi and Jiang Wan: 

On another occasion, Zhuge Liang said: 

===Xi Zheng&#x27;s views===
Xi Zheng, a scholar from Shu who later served as an official under the Jin dynasty, commented on Jiang Wei as follows: 

===Sun Sheng&#x27;s views===
The Jin dynasty historian Sun Sheng responded to Xi Zheng&#x27;s comments on Jiang Wei as follows: 

In his &quot;Jin Yang Qiu&quot; (晉陽秋), Sun Sheng also wrote: 

===Chen Shou&#x27;s views===
Chen Shou, the Jin dynasty historian who wrote Jiang Wei&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, appraised Jiang Wei as follows: 

===He Zhuo&#x27;s views===
The Qing dynasty writer He Zhuo (何焯) wrote:

The Jin dynasty historian Gan Bao wrote: 

===Wang Mingsheng&#x27;s views===
The Qing dynasty historian Wang Mingsheng (王鳴盛) wrote: 

===Pei Songzhi&#x27;s views===
The Liu Song dynasty historian Pei Songzhi, who annotated the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on Jiang Wei as follows: 

Pei Songzhi also rebutted Sun Sheng&#x27;s response to Xi Zheng&#x27;s comments on Jiang Wei: 

===Chang Qu&#x27;s views===
Chang Qu, who wrote extensively about the history of the Sichuan region in the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; (&quot;Huayang Guo Zhi&quot;), commented on Jiang Wei as follows: 

===Miscellaneous===
The &quot;Shiyu&quot; (世語) recorded that Jiang Wei had no equal among the talented persons serving in the Shu government during his time.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Jiang Wei is a major character in the later chapters of the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events and figures of the late Eastern Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period of China. In the novel, he is depicted as Zhuge Liang&#x27;s protégé and successor who inherits the legacy of leading Shu into war against Wei with the aim of restoring the fallen Eastern Han dynasty.

Jiang Wei first appears in Chapters 92 and 93 as a Wei military officer serving in Tianshui Commandery during Zhuge Liang&#x27;s first Northern Expedition. When Zhuge Liang tries to trick Ma Zun, the Administrator of Tianshui, to lead his troops out of Tianshui to save the Wei general Xiahou Mao in Nan&#x27;an Commandery, Jiang Wei sees through Zhuge Liang&#x27;s ruse and advises Ma Zun to remain in Tianshui and set a trap for the enemy. When the Shu general Zhao Yun shows up to take Tianshui, he falls into the trap and briefly duels with Jiang Wei before Shu reinforcements arrive and save him. Zhao Yun tells Zhuge Liang that he is impressed that Tianshui has such a talent like Jiang Wei. When Jiang Wei successfully repels another Shu attack, Zhuge Liang is even more impressed and eager to recruit Jiang Wei to serve in Shu. He tricks Ma Zun into believing that Jiang Wei has defected to Shu in order to prevent Jiang Wei from going back to Wei, and then springs a trap for Jiang Wei. When Jiang Wei gets cornered, he attempts suicide but Zhuge Liang stops him and manages to convince him to surrender and join Shu.

Jiang Wei accompanies Zhuge Liang on his subsequent Northern Expeditions. Chapters 107 to 115 dramatise Jiang Wei&#x27;s Northern Expeditions and refer to them as Jiang Wei&#x27;s &quot;Nine Campaigns on the Central Plains&quot; when historically there were actually eleven campaigns instead of nine. In Chapter 119, Jiang Wei instigates Zhong Hui to launch a rebellion against Wei, but their rebellion fails when some of Zhong Hui&#x27;s officers start a mutiny against their superior. Cornered by the enemy, Jiang Wei sighs, &quot;It is Heaven&#x27;s will that my plan doesn&#x27;t succeed!&quot; He then commits suicide by slitting his throat.

A verse from the novel in Jiang Wei&#x27;s honour reads: 

==In popular culture==

Jiang Wei appears as a playable character in the video game series &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; produced by Koei Tecmo. In the games, he is portrayed as a young warrior fiercely devoted to his mentor Zhuge Liang. He also appears in Koei Tecmo&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; series.

==Memorials and relics==
A Jiang Wei Memorial Museum (姜維紀念館) was constructed in 1999 near Jiang Wei&#x27;s hometown in the east of Gangu County, Tianshui, Gansu. The museum, covering an area of 360 square metres, was funded by the locals. Among other things, it contains a four-metre-tall statue of Jiang Wei in the main hall, as well as a stone tablet inscribed with the words &quot;Jiang Wei&#x27;s hometown&quot; in calligraphy by the general Yang Chengwu.

The Pingxiang Tower (平襄楼) in present-day Lushan County, Sichuan is a 24-metre-tall building commemorating Jiang Wei. Its name comes from Jiang Wei&#x27;s peerage, the Marquis of Pingxiang (平襄侯). The tower was built during the Song dynasty, renovated in 1445 during the Ming dynasty, and designated as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level by China&#x27;s State Administration of Cultural Heritage in 2006.

There are a number of relics related to Jiang Wei at Jianmen Pass in present-day Jiange County, Sichuan, including a Jiang Wei Well (姜維井), Jiang Wei Cave (姜維洞), Jiang Wei Fortress (姜維城), Jiang Wei Temple (姜維廟), Lord Jiang Bridge (姜公橋), Jiang Wei Armoury (姜維軍械) and Jiang Wei Tomb (姜維墓). Poets such as Lu You, Zuo Mu (左牧), Li Tiaoyuan (李調元) and Zhuang Xuehe (莊學和) have written poems at Jianmen Pass to praise Jiang Wei.

The Chinese Type 053H2G class and Type 053H3 class of frigates have the NATO code names Jiangwei I class and Jiangwei II class respectively. Whether this is a conincidence or in memorial of Jiang Wei is unknown.

<text>Sun Jian () () (155–191?), courtesy name Wentai, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He allied himself with Yuan Shu in 190 when warlords from eastern China formed a coalition to oust Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who held the puppet Emperor Xian in his power. Although he controlled neither many troops nor much land, Sun Jian&#x27;s personal bravery and resourcefulness were feared by Dong Zhuo, who placed him among Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and Liu Biao as the most influential men at that time. After the coalition disbanded in the next year, China fell into civil war. In 191, Sun Jian was killed in battle during an offensive campaign against Liu Biao.

Sun Jian was also the father of Sun Quan, one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms era who eventually established the Eastern Wu state and declared himself its first emperor in 229, whereupon Sun Jian was given the posthumous title Emperor Wulie ().

==Early life and career==

Sun Jian was born in Fuchun County (), Wu Commandery, around present day Fuyang, Zhejiang. He was allegedly a descendant of Sun Tzu, the author of &quot;The Art of War&quot;. No more immediate records survive, indicating his family probably played a very small part during the Han dynasty. Even his father&#x27;s name is unrecorded, although a folk tradition gives it as Sun Zhong ().

Sun Jian was a civil official in his home county during his youth. When he was 16, Sun Jian travelled with his father to Qiantang, where they encountered a band of pirates dividing up their spoils on land. Sun Jian jumped on shore with a sabre in hand and pointed in different directions as if commanding a detachment of soldiers to surround the pirates. Seeing this, the pirates were deceived and fled. Sun Jian pursued, and only after taking the head of every pirate did he return (or just the leaders according to some accounts). His name henceforth spread.

In 172, he became acting major for the pro-government militias which fought against Xu Chang&#x27;s rebellion in Kuaiji Commandery. He raised a militia of about 1,000 men and served with distinction, whereupon he was recommended to the court by Yang Province Inspector Zhang Min. Sun Jian was consequently rewarded with a post as assistant magistrate in Guangling Commandery, and later in two counties in Xiapi. This allowed him to gather many followers.

In 184, the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao broke out across the country. Sun Jian joined the general Zhu Jun to quell the rebellion in Yu Province (covering roughly present-day southern Henan and northern Anhui). The soldiers fought hard, forcing the rebels to retreat to Wan (宛; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan). Sun Jian placed himself in the forefront and climbed onto the city walls alone. The rest then swarmed in and defeated the rebels.

Around this time, Bian Zhang and Han Sui colluded with the Qiang tribes and rebelled in Liang Province (涼州; present-day western Gansu). After Dong Zhuo failed to put down the rebellion, the central government sent in his place the Minister of Works Zhang Wen, who invited Sun Jian along as an adviser. When Zhang Wen summoned Dong Zhuo to the encampment at Chang&#x27;an, Dong Zhuo procrastinated and took a long time to arrive. When he did, he showed little respect for Zhang Wen. Sun Jian then advised Zhang Wen to execute Dong Zhuo, but Zhang Wen declined as Dong Zhuo held high reputation in the west.

Despite scoring a major victory against the rebels at Meiyang, Zhang Wen could not press their advantage and the rebellion was still not quelled. Zhang Wen and the rest returned to the capital Luoyang in disgrace and thus no honor was accorded. Meanwhile, another local-scale rebellion broke out near Changsha Commandery and the rebels besieged the city. Sun Jian was then appointed as the Administrator of Changsha Commandery. Within a month upon taking up office, Sun Jian had quelled the rebellion. Meanwhile, rebellions also broke out in the neighbouring commanderies of Lingling (零陵; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (桂陽; around present-day Guiyang County, Hunan). Sun Jian defeated the rebel leaders Ou Xing (), Zhou Chao () and Guo Shi (), and suppressed both rebellions. The Han imperial court enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Wucheng () in recognition of his contributions.

==Coalition against Dong Zhuo==
In 189, Emperor Ling died, leaving his young son in the care of Empress Dowager He and General-in-Chief He Jin. He Jin then summoned Dong Zhuo to lead troops into the capital to assist in a plot to eliminate the powerful eunuch faction. Before Dong Zhuo arrived, however, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuchs and Luoyang fell into chaos following a clash between supporters of both sides. Dong Zhuo then seized military control of the capital and deposed the young emperor for the puppet Emperor Xian. However, his tyrannical ways incurred the wrath of many and in the following year, warlords from eastern China formed a coalition against him.

Sun Jian also raised an army and joined Yuan Shu, one of the leaders of the coalition at Luyang (魯陽; present-day Lushan County, Henan). On his way, he killed Inspector of Jing Province Wang Rui and Administrator of Nanyang Zhang Zi. Yuan Shu appointed Sun Jian as General Who Destroys Barbarians (破虜將軍, also translated as &quot;General Who Smashes the Caitiffs&quot;) and Inspector of Yu Province (). Sun Jian then began training and preparing his troops at Luyang. A force sent by Dong Zhuo was so impressed with the strict discipline of Sun Jian&#x27;s troops that they gave up the plan to attack Luyang. When Sun Jian moved out to Liangdong (梁東; east of present-day Linru County, Henan), he was outnumbered by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s forces. With several dozen horsemen, Sun Jian broke out of the encirclement. He took off the red felt scarf he had always been wearing and handed it to his trusted aide Zu Mao (), whom Dong Zhuo&#x27;s soldiers then chased after while Sun Jian escaped. Unable to shake off his pursuers, Zu Mao then dismounted, hung the scarf onto a half-burnt pillar, and hid himself in the tall grass nearby. The enemies surrounded the pillar and approached cautiously till they realised they had been fooled, whereupon they retreated.

After regrouping his troops, Sun Jian pressed his troops towards Luoyang and engaged in battle against Dong Zhuo&#x27;s forces at Yangren (陽人; believed to be near present-day Wenquan, Ruzhou, Henan). He scored a brilliant victory and killed the enemy commander Hua Xiong in battle (191). At this time, someone told Yuan Shu that if Sun Jian defeated Dong Zhuo and took over Luoyang, he would no longer submit to anyone. Feeling doubtful, Yuan Shu stopped providing food supplies to Sun Jian&#x27;s army. Sun Jian rode the hundred odd &quot;li&quot; from Yangren to Luyang overnight to see Yuan Shu, whereupon he told the latter, &quot;I put myself in danger during battle, firstly to eliminate the villain (Dong Zhuo) for the Han Empire, and secondly to avenge the deaths of your family members. I have no personal grudge against Dong Zhuo. Yet you believe slanderous talks and suspect me!&quot; The words put Yuan Shu to shame and he immediately ordered his men to continue delivering food supplies to Sun Jian&#x27;s army.

Fearing Sun Jian, Dong Zhuo then sent his general Li Jue as an emissary to seek peace and propose a marriage to cement the alliance. However, Sun Jian rejected the proposals with harsh words and continued to lead his troops towards Luoyang. In late 190, his army was merely 90 &quot;li&quot; away from the capital when Dong Zhuo retreated west to Chang&#x27;an after ordering the destruction of Luoyang by fire. Entering the ruins of Luoyang, Sun Jian ordered his men to reseal the tombs of Han emperors that were excavated by Dong Zhuo, after which he returned to Luyang. It was said in the &quot;Book of Wu&quot; () by Wei Zhao that Sun Jian found one of the emperor&#x27;s jade seals in a well south of Luoyang and kept it. Later, when Yuan Shu declared himself emperor, he held Sun Jian&#x27;s wife Lady Wu hostage in exchange for the seal.

==Later life==
In 191, Yuan Shu sent Sun Jian to attack Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province (荆州; covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). He defeated Liu Biao&#x27;s forces led by Huang Zu and pursued the enemy across the Han River to Xiangyang. While he was travelling alone through Xianshan (), Huang Zu&#x27;s troops ambushed him and shot him to death with arrows. The &quot;Record of Heroes&quot; () by Wang Can, however, claims that Sun Jian died in 193 and that he was crushed to death by boulders while pursuing the enemy commander Lü Gong (). Sun Jian&#x27;s nephew, Sun Ben, gathered his uncle&#x27;s troops and returned to Yuan Shu, who then appointed him as the Inspector of Yu Province to replace his uncle.

Sun Jian was buried in the Gao Mausoleum in Qu&#x27;e (曲阿; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu). He was survived by at least five sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Sun Ce, became a warlord and conquered several territories in the Jiangdong region. Like his father, Sun Ce died at a relatively young age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Sun Quan. Sun Quan built on his brother&#x27;s legacy and eventually established the state of Eastern Wu in 229, with himself as its founding emperor, during the Three Kingdoms period. Lady Sun later married the warlord and founder of the state of Shu Han, Liu Bei, in an attempt to forge an alliance to defeat Cao Cao after the Battle of Red Cliff. After ascending the throne, Sun Quan honoured his father with the posthumous title &quot;Emperor Wulie&quot; ().

==Historical discrepancies on death date==
There are multiple differing accounts on Sun Jian&#x27;s death date.
===Death in 191===
A &quot;Wu Lu&quot; annotation in Sun Ce&#x27;s biography in &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that Sun Ce stated in a memorial to the imperial court that he was 17 (by East Asian reckoning) when his father died. In this account, since Sun Ce died in 200 at the age of 26 (by East Asian reckoning), Sun Jian should have died in 191.

===Death in 192===
Sun Jian&#x27;s biography in &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that he was sent by Yuan Shu to attack Jing province in the 3rd year of the &quot;Chuping&quot; era of Liu Xie&#x27;s reign. This account was also found in &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; (volume 09) and &quot;Annals of the Later Han&quot; (compiled by Yuan Hong; volume 27). Pei Songzhi in his commentary found in Sun Ce&#x27;s biography of &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; noted that Sun Jian dying in 192 as recorded in his &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; biography should be an error, noting that Zhang Fan&#x27;s &quot;Annals of Han&quot; and the &quot;Wu Li&quot; both recorded that Sun Jian died in 191. Sima Guang, in his &quot;Zizhi Tongjian Kao Yi&quot;, agreed that Sun Jian died in 191.

===Death in 193===
Wang Can&#x27;s &quot;Records of Heroes&quot; recorded that Sun Jian died on the 7th day of the 1st month of the 4th year of the &quot;Chuping&quot; era. This corresponds to 25 February 193 in the Julian calendar.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, some events of Sun Jian were romanticised by Luo Guanzhong.

Sun Jian first appears the novel in Chapter 2 as a great warrior and descendant of Sun Tzu who takes part in suppressing the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Later, he joins the coalition against Dong Zhuo. In the battle against Hua Xiong, the commander of the enemy army, Sun Jian took off his own red scarf and handed it to Zu Mao () when Sun Jian&#x27;s army was raided. Having distracted Hua Xiong and let Sun Jian escape, Zu Mao was chased after by Hua Xiong, so he hid himself in woods after hanging the scarf on a half-burnt pillar. When Hua Xiong found himself to be fooled, he killed Zu Mao who dashed out of his hideout to challenge him. Hua Xiong then launched an attack on Sun&#x27;s army, which lasted for a whole night. Sun Jian could not resist Hua Xiong, so he called for assistance from the coalition. Hua Xiong was unrivalled until he met the unfamed Guan Yu.

After Dong Zhuo retreated to Chang&#x27;an, Sun Jian was the first to enter Luoyang and ordered to put off the fires set by Dong Zhuo. Seeing the destruction of the imperial capital and Han dynasty, Sun Jian sighed and shed a tear. However, when his men found a jade seal, which was proven to be the imperial seal, Sun Jian grew ambitious and requested to retreat to his base. The news was leaked, to Sun Jian&#x27;s miscalculation. When Yuan Shao, the leader of the coalition, interrogated Sun Jian, the latter swore by saying, &quot;Should I have hid the treasure, I shall die miserably under arrows!&quot; Under the protection by his guards, Sun Jian left Luoyang immediately.

On the way to his base, Sun Jian passed through Jing Province, where the governor, Liu Biao, was asked by Yuan Shao to attack Sun Jian. Sun Jian badly lost the battle and barely escaped. When he later launched a revenge attack upon Jing Provence, in accordance with the order of his senior, Yuan Shu, he was lured under a cliff where he was shot dead by arrows from the above. Sun&#x27;s camp reclaimed Sun Jian&#x27;s corpse using a captive, Huang Zu, who was Liu Biao&#x27;s brother-in-law. When Dong Zhuo heard of Sun&#x27;s death in Chang&#x27;an, he said, &quot;One of my greatest enemies is removed!&quot; and consequently usurped more power in the imperial court.

==In popular culture==
Sun Jian is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. He also appears in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; series.

He is a playable warlord in the 2019 game &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot; by Creative Assembly.

In the SD Gundam series &quot;BB Senshi Sangokuden&quot;, which is based on &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Sun Jian is characterised as the Gundam Sonken Zephyranthes. His design invokes a white tiger motif as he was known in life as the Tiger of Jiandong.

In Koei&#x27;s 2023 video game &quot;Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty&quot;, Sun Jian appears as a character and one of the bosses of the game.

<text>Zhuge Liang () (181September or October 234), also commonly known by his courtesy name Kongming, was a Chinese statesman, strategist, and inventor who lived through the end of the Eastern Han dynasty ( 184–220) and the early Three Kingdoms period (220–280) of China. During the Three Kingdoms period, he served as the Imperial Chancellor (or Prime Minister) of the state of Shu Han (221–263) from its founding in 221 and later as regent from 223 until his death in September or October 234.

He is recognised as the most accomplished strategist of his era. His reputation as an intelligent and cultured scholar grew even while he was living in relative seclusion, earning him the nickname &quot;Wolong&quot; or &quot;Fulong&quot; (both meaning &quot;Sleeping Dragon&quot;).

Zhuge Liang&#x27;s methods of administration drew both from Legalism as well as Confucianism. He was critical of the Legalist thought of Shang Yang, and advocated benevolence and education as tenets of being a ruler. He compared himself with Guan Zhong, developing Shu&#x27;s agriculture and industry to become a regional power. He attached great importance to the works of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, refusing to indulge local elites and adopting strict, but fair and clear laws. In remembrance of his governance, local people maintained shrines to him for ages.

Zhuge is an uncommon two-character Chinese compound family name. In 760, when Emperor Suzong of the Tang dynasty built a temple to honour Jiang Ziya, he had sculptures of ten famous historical military generals and strategists placed in the temple flanking Jiang Ziya&#x27;s statue: Zhuge Liang, Bai Qi, Han Xin, Li Jing, Li Shiji, Zhang Liang, Sima Rangju, Sun Tzu, Wu Qi, and Yue Yi.

==Historical sources==

The authoritative historical source on Zhuge Liang&#x27;s life is his biography in Volume 35 of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), which was written by the historian Chen Shou (233–297) in the third century. Chen Shou had worked in the historical offices of the Shu Han government, and had previously collated Zhuge Liang&#x27;s writings into an anthology. The scope of this collection may have been limited to official government documents.

In the fifth century, the Liu Song dynasty historian Pei Songzhi (372–451) annotated the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou&#x27;s original work and adding his personal commentary. Some alternative texts used in the annotations to the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; include:
* &quot;Xiandi Chunqiu&quot; (獻帝春秋; &quot;Chronicles of Emperor Xian&quot;) by Yuan Wei (袁暐)
* &quot;Han Jin Chunqiu&quot; (漢晉春秋; &quot;Chronicles of Han and Jin&quot;) by Xi Zuochi

During the Qing dynasty, the historian Zhang Zhu (張澍; 1776–1847) compiled and arranged multiple pieces of literature on Zhuge Liang into an 11-volume collection called &quot;Zhuge Zhongwu Hou Wen Ji&quot; (諸葛忠武侯文集; &quot;Literature Collection of Marquis Zhuge Zhongwu&quot;). The collection contained, among other things, a preface by Zhang Zhu, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s biography from the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s writings, imperial edicts issued to Zhuge Liang, and appraisals of Zhuge Liang. In 1960, Duan Xizhong (段熙仲) and Wen Xuchu () annotated and reorganised Zhang Zhu&#x27;s original collection, and had it published by the Zhonghua Book Company under the title &quot;Zhuge Liang Ji&quot; (; &quot;Collected Works of Zhuge Liang&quot;).

==Family background==
Zhuge Liang&#x27;s ancestral home was in Yangdu County (), Langya Commandery (琅邪郡), near present-day Yinan County or Yishui County, Shandong. There are two other accounts of his ancestral origins in the &quot;Wu Shu&quot; () and &quot;Fengsu Tongyi&quot; (風俗同意).

The &quot;Wu Shu&quot; recorded that his ancestral family name was actually Ge () and his ancestors were originally from Zhu County (; southwest of present-day Zhucheng, Shandong) before they settled in Yangdu County. As there was already another Ge family in Yangdu County before they came, the locals referred to the newcomers as the &quot;Zhuge&quot; – combining &quot;Zhu&quot; (County) and &quot;Ge&quot; – to distinguish them from the other Ge family. Over time, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s ancestors adopted &quot;Zhuge&quot; as their family name.

The &quot;Fengsu Tongyi&quot; recorded that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s ancestor was Ge Ying (:zh:葛嬰), who served under Chen Sheng, a rebel leader who led the Dazexiang uprising against the Qin dynasty. Chen Sheng later executed Ge Ying. During the early Western Han dynasty, Emperor Wen considered that Ge Ying was unjustly put to death so he enfeoffed Ge Ying&#x27;s grandson as the Marquis of Zhu County to honour Ge Ying. Over time, Ge Ying&#x27;s descendants adopted &quot;Zhuge&quot; as their family name by combining &quot;Zhu&quot; (County) and &quot;Ge&quot;.

The earliest known ancestor of Zhuge Liang who bore the family name &quot;Zhuge&quot; was Zhuge Feng (諸葛豐), a Western Han dynasty official who served as Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隷校尉) under Emperor Yuan (48–33 BCE). Zhuge Liang&#x27;s father, Zhuge Gui (), whose courtesy name was Jungong (), served as an assistant official in Taishan Commandery (泰山郡; around present-day Tai&#x27;an, Shandong) during the late Eastern Han dynasty under Emperor Ling (168–189 CE).

Zhuge Liang had an elder brother, a younger brother, and two elder sisters. His elder brother was Zhuge Jin and his younger brother was Zhuge Jun (諸葛均). The elder of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s two sisters married Kuai Qi (蒯祺), a nephew of Kuai Yue and Kuai Liang. While the younger one married Pang Shanmin (龐山民), a cousin of Pang Tong.

==Physical appearance==
The only known historical description of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s physical appearance comes from the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, which recorded that he was eight &quot;chi&quot; tall (approximately ) with &quot;a magnificent appearance&quot; that astonished his contemporaries.

In later sources, it is said that during the northern expedition, Zhuge Liang commanded the three armies with a white feather fan while wearing a headscarf made of kudzu cloth and riding on a plain chariot.

The Moss Roberts&#x27; translation of the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s appearance is described as follows: The original Chinese text in the novel mentions that Zhuge Liang wore a &quot;guanjin&quot; (綸巾; a type of headscarf or hat) and a &quot;hechang&quot; (鶴氅; a robe commonly worn by Daoists).
==Early life (181–207)==
As Zhuge Liang was orphaned at a young age, he was raised by Zhuge Xuan, one of his father&#x27;s cousins. He accompanied Zhuge Xuan to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) when the latter was appointed as the Commandery Administrator sometime in the mid-190s. Later, after the Han central government designated Zhu Hao as the new Administrator, Zhuge Xuan left Yuzhang Commandery and brought Zhuge Liang and Zhuge Jun to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to live with the provincial governor Liu Biao, whom he was an old friend of.

After Zhuge Xuan died, Zhuge Liang moved to Deng County () in Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡), and settled down in Longzhong (), an area about 20 &quot;li&quot; west of Xiangyang, the capital of Jing Province. In Longzhong, he lived the life of a peasant and spent his free time reading and travelling. He enjoyed reciting &quot;Liangfu Yin&quot; (), a folk song popular in the area around his ancestral home in Shandong. Zhuge Liang maintained close relations with well-known intellectuals such as Sima Hui, Pang Degong and Huang Chengyan. However, other local literati scorned him when they learnt that he often compared himself to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi. Only a few, namely Cui Zhouping (崔州平), Xu Shu, Shi Tao () and Meng Jian (), got along well with him and agreed that he was comparable to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi.

Between the late 190s and early 200s, Zhuge Liang often studied and travelled with Xu Shu, Shi Guangyuan and Meng Gongwei. Whenever he read, he only picked up the key points and moved on. His three friends, in contrast, focused on details and sometimes even memorised them. Throughout his time in Longzhong, he led a carefree life and took his time to do things. He often sat down with his arms around his knees, sighing to himself from time to time while in deep thought. He once told his three friends that they would become commandery administrators or provincial governors if they served in the government. When they asked him what his ambition was, he only laughed and did not give an answer.

==Meeting with Liu Bei (207–208)==
===Recommendation from Sima Hui and Xu Shu===
At the time, the warlord Liu Bei was living in Xinye County as a guest of Liu Biao, the governor of Jing Province. During this time, he met the hermit Sima Hui and consulted him on the affairs of their time. Sima Hui said, &quot;What do Confucian academics and common scholars know about current affairs? Only outstanding talents have the best understanding of current affairs. In this region, there are two of such talents: Crouching Dragon and Young Phoenix.&quot; When Liu Bei asked him who &quot;Crouching Dragon&quot; and &quot;Young Phoenix&quot; were, Sima Hui replied, &quot;Zhuge Kongming and Pang Shiyuan.&quot; Xu Shu, whom Liu Bei regarded highly, also recommended Zhuge Liang by saying, &quot;Zhuge Kongming is the Crouching Dragon. General, don&#x27;t you want to meet him?&quot; When Liu Bei asked Xu Shu if he could bring Zhuge Liang to meet him, Xu Shu advised him to personally visit Zhuge Liang instead of asking Zhuge Liang to come to him.

===Liu Bei&#x27;s three visits===
The &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded in just one sentence that Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang three times and met him. The &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; recorded that the meeting(s) took place in 207. Chen Shou also mentions the three visits in his biographical sketch of Zhuge Liang appended to the memoirs Chen Shou compiled.

During their private meeting, Liu Bei sought Zhuge Liang&#x27;s advice on how to compete with the powerful warlords and revive the declining Han dynasty. In response, Zhuge Liang presented his Longzhong Plan, which envisaged a tripartite division of China between the domains of Liu Bei, Cao Cao and Sun Quan. According to the plan, Liu Bei should seize control of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) and Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from their respective governors, Liu Biao and Liu Zhang, and establish a solid foothold in southern and western China. Liu Bei would then form an alliance with Sun Quan, who ruled eastern China, and wage war against Cao Cao, who controlled northern China and the political centre of the Han dynasty in central China.

After the meeting, Liu Bei became very close to Zhuge Liang and spent much time with him – much to Guan Yu and Zhang Fei&#x27;s chagrin. Liu Bei explained to them, &quot;Now that I have Kongming, I am like a fish that has found water. I hope you&#x27;ll stop making unpleasant remarks.&quot; Guan Yu and Zhang Fei then stopped complaining.

==Formation of the Sun–Liu alliance (208–209)==
===Liu&#x27;s evacuation to Xiakou===

In the autumn of 208, shortly before Liu Biao&#x27;s death, Cao Cao led his forces on a southern campaign to conquer Jing Province. When Cao Cao&#x27;s forces reached Jing Province&#x27;s capital Xiangyang, Liu Biao&#x27;s younger son Liu Cong, who had succeeded his father as the Governor of Jing Province, surrendered to Cao Cao. Upon receiving news of Liu Cong&#x27;s surrender, Liu Bei immediately evacuated his base in Fancheng (; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei) and led thousands of his followers, both military and civilian, on a journey to Xiakou (; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei) to join Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son Liu Qi. Along the way, Cao Cao&#x27;s forces caught up with them and defeated them at the Battle of Changban. Along with only a handful of close followers, Liu Bei managed to escape, and upon reaching Xiakou sent Zhuge Liang as his representative to meet Sun Quan and discuss an alliance against Cao Cao.

===Meeting with Sun Quan===
Around the time, Sun Quan was in Chaisang (; southwest of present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) and had been closely observing the developments in Jing Province. When Zhuge Liang met Sun Quan, he said: 

When Sun Quan asked him why Liu Bei did not surrender to Cao Cao, Zhuge Liang replied: 

An enraged Sun Quan then said that he would not allow anyone but himself to rule the territories and people in Wu. When he asked Zhuge Liang how Liu Bei could expect to resist Cao Cao, given his recent defeat at Changban, Zhuge Liang replied: 

===Zhang Zhao&#x27;s recommendation===
Yuan Zhun&#x27;s &quot;Yuanzi&quot; recorded that when Zhuge Liang was in Chaisang, Zhang Zhao recommended he switch allegiance from Liu Bei to Sun Quan, but Zhuge Liang refused. When Zhang Zhao asked him why, Zhuge Liang said, &quot;[Sun Quan] is a good leader of men. However, from what I observe about his character, he will make good use of my abilities but not to their fullest extent. That is why I don&#x27;t want to serve under him.&quot;

Pei Songzhi noted how differently this episode portrayed Zhuge Liang&#x27;s special and &quot;sui generis&quot; relationship with Liu Bei, and pointed out that his loyalty to Liu Bei was so firm that nothing would make him switch allegiance to Sun Quan— not even if Sun Quan could make full use of his abilities. Pei Songzhi then cited a similar example of how Guan Yu, during his brief service under Cao Cao, maintained unwavering loyalty to Liu Bei even though Cao Cao treated him very generously.

===Battle of Red Cliffs===

After initial advisement against Zhuge Liang&#x27;s plan for a Sun–Liu alliance, further consultation with his generals Lu Su and Zhou Yu convinced Sun Quan to move forward with it. He ordered Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, Lu Su and others to lead 30,000 troops to join Liu Bei in resisting Cao Cao&#x27;s invasion. In the winter of 208, the allied forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Cao Cao retreated to Ye (; in present-day Handan, Hebei) after his defeat.

==Service in southern Jing Province (209–211)==

Following the Battle of Red Cliffs, Liu Bei nominated Liu Qi as the Inspector of Jing Province and sent his forces to conquer the four commanderies in southern Jing Province: Wuling (; near Changde, Hunan), Changsha, Guiyang (; near Chenzhou, Hunan) and Lingling (; near Yongzhou, Hunan). The administrators of the four commanderies surrendered to him. After Liu Qi died in 209, acting on Lu Su&#x27;s advice, Sun Quan agreed to &quot;lend&quot; the territories in Jing Province to Liu Bei and nominate him to succeed Liu Qi as the Governor of Jing Province.

After assuming governorship of southern Jing Province in 209, Liu Bei appointed Zhuge Liang as Military Adviser General of the Household () and put him in charge of collecting tax revenue from Lingling, Guiyang and Changsha commanderies for his military forces. During this time, Zhuge Liang was stationed in Linzheng County (; present-day Hengyang, Hunan) in Changsha Commandery.

==Conquest of Yi Province (211–214)==
In 211, Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), invited Liu Bei to lead troops into Yi Province to assist him in countering his rival, Zhang Lu, in Hanzhong Commandery. While Liu Bei was away in Jing Province, Zhuge Liang remained behind with Guan Yu and others to guard Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province.

When Liu Bei decided to take over Liu Zhang&#x27;s lands in 212, Zhuge Liang, along with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and others, led troops from Jing Province into Yi Province to reinforce Liu Bei. They conquered many counties and commanderies along the way and eventually joined Liu Bei in surrounding Chengdu, the capital of Yi Province.

After Liu Zhang surrendered and relinquished control over Yi Province to Liu Bei in 214, Zhuge Liang was appointed as Military Adviser General () and made a staff member of the office of the General of the Left (), the nominal appointment Liu Bei held at the time. Whenever Liu Bei went on military campaigns, Zhuge Liang remained behind to guard Chengdu and ensured that the city was well-stocked with supplies and well-defended.

==Liu&#x27;s coronation (214–223)==

In late 220, some months after Cao Cao&#x27;s death, his son and successor Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Wei with himself as the new emperor. This event marks the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in China. In the following year, Liu Bei&#x27;s followers urged him to declare himself emperor to challenge Cao Pi&#x27;s legitimacy, but Liu Bei refused.

Zhuge said: 

In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established the state of Shu Han. He appointed Zhuge Liang as his Imperial Chancellor (丞相) as follows: 

Zhuge Liang also held the additional appointment of &quot;Lu Shangshu Shi&quot; (錄尚書事), the Supervisor of the Imperial Secretariat, and had full acting imperial authority. After Zhang Fei&#x27;s death in mid 221, Zhuge Liang took on an additional appointment as Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隷校尉), which Zhang Fei previously held.

==Appointment as regent (223)==
Following his defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting in 222, Liu Bei retreated to Yong&#x27;an County (; present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing) and became critically ill in early 223. He summoned Zhuge from Chengdu, and told him: &quot;Sir, you&#x27;re ten times more talented than Cao Pi. You&#x27;ll definitely bring peace to the Empire and accomplish our great mission. If my heir can be assisted, then assist him; if he turns out to be incompetent, then you may make your own decision.&quot;

With tears in his eyes, Zhuge replied: &quot;I&#x27;ll do my utmost and serve with unwavering loyalty until death!&quot; Liu Bei then instructed Liu Shan, his son and heir apparent, as follows: &quot;When you work together with the Imperial Chancellor, you must treat him like your father.&quot; Liu Bei then named Zhuge Liang as regent for Liu Shan, and Li Yan as deputy regent. He died on 10 June 223 in Yong&#x27;an County.

The last command of Liu Bei to Zhuge Liang, translated literally above as &quot;you may make your own decision&quot; (), is ambiguous. Chen Shou commented that Liu Bei wholeheartly trusted Zhuge Liang and was permitting him to assume leadership. Yi Zhongtian in his &quot;Analysis of the Three Kingdoms&quot; presented several interpretations of Liu Bei&#x27;s message. Some argued that Liu Bei said that only to test Zhuge Liang&#x27;s loyalty as his brother, Zhuge Jin, was working for Eastern Wu. Others commented that the ambiguous phrase did not mean Zhuge Liang was allowed take the throne for himself, but he was permitted to, when the situation demanded, replace Liu Shan with other of Liu Bei&#x27;s living sons such as Liu Yong and Liu Li.

Following Liu Bei&#x27;s death, Liu Shan ascended the throne and succeeded his father as the emperor of Shu. After his coronation, Liu Shan enfeoffed Zhuge Liang as the Marquis of Wu District () and created a personal staff to assist him. Later, Zhuge Liang assumed an additional appointment as Governor of Yi Province (). He personally oversaw all state affairs and made the final call on all policy decisions.

When rebellions broke out in the Nanzhong region of southern Shu, Zhuge Liang did not immediately take military action to suppress the rebellions because he thought it was not appropriate to do so in light of the recent death of Liu Bei. In late 223, he sent Deng Zhi as Shu&#x27;s ambassador to Eastern Wu to make peace and rebuild the Wu–Shu alliance against Cao Wei.

During his regency, Zhuge Liang set Shu&#x27;s objective as the restoration of the Han dynasty, continuing Liu Bei&#x27;s objective. He appointed large numbers of local elites as low level officials, improving relations between Liu Bei&#x27;s conquest bureaucracy, local elites, and the people of Shu.

==Refusing to submit to Wei (223–225)==
Shortly after he became regent, he received letters from various Wei officials – including Hua Xin, Wang Lang, Chen Qun, Xu Zhi (許芝) and Zhuge Zhang () – asking him to surrender to Wei and make Shu a vassal state under Wei. Instead of responding to any of the letters, he wrote a memo, called &quot;Zheng Yi&quot; (; &quot;Exhortation to Correct Action&quot;), as follows: 

==Southern Campaign (225–227)==

Zhuge Liang wanted to personally lead the Shu forces on a southern campaign to the Nanzhong region to suppress the rebellions which erupted in 223, as well as to pacify and gain the allegiance of the Nanman tribes living there. Wang Lian, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s chief clerk, strongly objected to his boss&#x27;s participation in the campaign because it was too dangerous. He argued that given Zhuge Liang&#x27;s important status in Shu, he should not undertake such a risky venture. However, Zhuge Liang insisted on personally leading the campaign as he was worried that none of the Shu generals was competent enough to deal with the rebels on his own. Ma Su, an adviser under Zhuge Liang, suggested that rather than conventional warfare, they focus on psychological warfare, winning the hearts of the people in Nanzhong, so as to prevent rebellions from breaking out again. Zhuge Liang readily accepted Ma Su&#x27;s advice.

In the spring of 225, Zhuge Liang led the Shu forces on the southern campaign. They defeated the rebel leaders Yong Kai (雍闓), Gao Ding () and Zhu Bao (朱褒), and pacified the three commanderies of Jianning (; around Qujing, Yunnan), Yuexi/Yuesui (; around Xichang, Sichuan) and Zangke (; around Guiyang or Fuquan, Guizhou). After that, they turned their attention to Meng Huo, a local leader who supported the rebels. Zhuge Liang knew that Meng Huo was a popular and respected figure in Nanzhong among the Nanman and local Han Chinese, so he decided to let Meng Huo live. After capturing Meng Huo in battle, Zhuge Liang showed him around the Shu camp and asked him what he thought. Meng Huo replied, &quot;Before this, I knew nothing about your army, which was why I lost. Now that you have shown me around your camp, I know the conditions of your army and will be able to win easily.&quot; Zhuge Liang laughed, released him and allowed him to return for another battle. The same cycle repeated for a total of seven times. On the seventh time, Meng Huo surrendered and told Zhuge Liang, &quot;My lord, against Heaven&#x27;s might the people of the south will never again rebel.&quot; Zhuge Liang then led his forces towards Dian Lake in triumph. The Nanzhong region was basically pacified by the autumn of 225.

Before pulling out all Shu soldiers from the Nanzhong region, Zhuge Liang told Meng Huo and other local leaders that all he required from them was to pay tribute to the Shu government, in the form of gold, silver, oxen, warhorses, etc. He also appointed locals such as Li Hui and Lü Kai to serve as the new commandery administrators, while the local leaders and tribal chiefs were allowed to continue governing their respective peoples and tribes. After the southern campaign, the Shu state became more prosperous as the Nanzhong region became a steady source of funding and supplies for the Shu military. Under Zhuge Liang&#x27;s direction, the Shu military also started training soldiers, stockpiling weapons and resources, etc., in preparation for an upcoming campaign against their rival Wei.

==Northern Expeditions (227–234)==
===Submitting the &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot;===

In 227, Zhuge Liang ordered troops from throughout Shu to mobilise and assemble in Hanzhong Commandery in preparation for a large-scale military campaign against Cao Wei. Before leaving, he wrote a memorial, called &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot; (&quot;memorial on the case to go to war&quot;), and submitted it to the Liu Shan. Among other things, the memorial contained Zhuge Liang&#x27;s reasons for the campaign against Wei and his personal advice to Liu Shan on governance issues. After Liu Shan approved, Zhuge Liang ordered the Shu forces to garrison at Mianyang (沔陽; present-day Mian County, Shaanxi).

===Tianshui revolts and Battle of Jieting===

In the spring of 228, Zhuge Liang ordered Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi to lead a detachment of troops to Ji Valley () and pretend to attack Mei County (; southeast of Fufeng County, Shaanxi) via Xie Valley (). Their mission was to distract and hold the Wei forces&#x27; attention, while Zhuge Liang led the Shu main army to attack Mount Qi (; the mountainous regions around Li County, Gansu). Upon reaching Mount Qi, Zhuge Liang deployed his troops in orderly formations and directed them with clear and strict commands. Three Wei-controlled commanderies – Nan&#x27;an (南安; around Longxi County, Gansu), Tianshui, and Anding (安定; around Zhenyuan County, Gansu) – responded to the invasion by defecting to the Shu side. News of the Shu invasion sent shockwaves throughout the Guanzhong region.

The Wei government was stunned when they learnt of the Shu invasion and totally unprepared for it because they had lowered their guard against Shu after Liu Bei&#x27;s death in 223 and had not heard anything from Shu since then. They were even more fearful and shocked when they heard of the three commanderies&#x27; defection. In response to the Shu invasion, Cao Rui moved from his imperial capital at Luoyang to Chang&#x27;an to oversee the defences in the Guanzhong region and provide backup. He sent Zhang He to attack Zhuge Liang at Mount Qi, and Cao Zhen to attack Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi at Ji Valley.

Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi lost to Cao Zhen at the battle in Ji Valley. Zhuge Liang had given them command of the weaker soldiers while he led the better troops to attack Mount Qi. Nevertheless, Zhao Yun managed to rally his men into putting up a firm defence as they retreated, thus minimising their losses. In the meantime at Mount Qi, Zhuge Liang had put Ma Su in charge of the vanguard force to engage the enemy. At Jieting (; or Jie Village, east of Qin&#x27;an County, Gansu), Ma Su not only went against Zhuge Liang&#x27;s instructions, but also made the wrong moves, resulting in the Shu vanguard suffering a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Wei forces under Zhang He. Zhang He also seized the opportunity to attack and reclaim the three commanderies for Wei.
Upon learning of the Shu defeats at Ji Valley and Jieting, Zhuge Liang pulled back the Shu forces and retreated to Hanzhong Commandery, where he resettled the few thousand families they captured in the Wei-controlled Xi County (; present-day Li County, Gansu) during the campaign. This happened in the late spring of 228. Zhuge Liang executed Ma Su for disobeying orders and to appease public anger. Afterward, he analysed why the campaign failed and told his subordinates: He also wrote a memorial to Liu Shan, taking full responsibility for the Shu defeats at Jieting and Ji Valley, acknowledging his mistakes and failure in judgment, and requesting to be demoted by three grades as punishment. Liu Shan approved and symbolically demoted him from Imperial Chancellor to General of the Right (), but allowed him to remain as acting Imperial Chancellor and continue performing the same duties as he did before.

===Siege of Chencang===

Between late spring and early winter of 228, Zhuge Liang directed his efforts towards reorganising the Shu military, strengthening discipline, and training the troops in preparation for another campaign. During this time, he received news that Shu&#x27;s ally Wu had defeated Wei at the Battle of Shiting around September 228. From this, he deduced that the Wei defences in the Guanzhong region must be weaker because Wei had mobilised its best troops to the eastern front to fight Wu.

In December 228, Zhuge Liang allegedly wrote a second &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot; to Liu Shan to urge war against Wei. However, historians such as Qian Dazhao (錢大昭) have cast doubts on the authenticity of the second &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot; and argued that it is falsely attributed to Zhuge Liang. Among other discrepancies, the second &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot; differs sharply from the first &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot; in tone, and already mentions Zhao Yun&#x27;s death when the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that he died in 229.

In the winter of 228–229, Zhuge Liang launched the second Northern Expedition and led the Shu forces out of San Pass (north of the Qin Mountains to the south of Baoji, Shaanxi) to attack the Wei fortress at Chencang (; east of Baoji). Before the campaign, Zhuge Liang already knew that Chencang was heavily fortified and difficult to capture, so when he showed up he was surprised to see that the fortress was additionally very well-defended. In fact, after the first Shu invasion, the Wei general Cao Zhen had predicted that Zhuge Liang would attack Chencang so he put Hao Zhao, a Wei general with a fierce reputation in the Guanzhong region, in charge of defending Chencang and strengthening its defences.

Zhuge Liang first ordered his troops to surround Chencang, then sent Jin Xiang (靳詳), an old friend of Hao Zhao, to persuade Hao Zhao to surrender. Hao Zhao refused twice. Although Hao Zhao had only 1,000 men with him to defend Chencang, he successfully held his ground against the Shu invaders. In the subsequent 20 days of siege, Zhuge Liang used an array of tactics to attack Chencang – siege ladders, battering rams, siege towers and underground tunnels – but Hao Zhao successfully countered each of them in turn. After failing to outwit Hao Zhao and take Chencang, and after learning that Wei reinforcements were approaching, Zhuge Liang decided to pull back his troops and return to base. Wang Shuang, a Wei officer, led his men to attack the retreating Shu forces, but was killed in an ambush laid by Zhuge Liang.

===Battle of Jianwei===

In the spring of 229, Zhuge Liang launched the third Northern Expedition and ordered Chen Shi to lead Shu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Wudu (; around present-day Cheng County, Gansu) and Yinping (; present-day Wen County, Gansu) commanderies. The Wei general Guo Huai led his troops to resist Chen Shi. He retreated when he heard that Zhuge Liang had led a Shu army to Jianwei (; in present-day Longnan, Gansu). The Shu forces then conquered Wudu and Yinping commanderies.

When Zhuge Liang returned from the campaign, Liu Shan issued an imperial decree to congratulate him on his successes in defeating Wang Shuang during the second Northern Expedition and capturing Wudu and Yinping commanderies during the third Northern Expedition. He also restored Zhuge Liang to the position of Imperial Chancellor.

===Congratulating Sun Quan on becoming emperor===
Around May 229, Sun Quan, the ruler of Shu&#x27;s ally state Wu, declared himself emperor and put himself on par with Liu Shan of Shu. When the news reached the Shu imperial court, many officials were outraged as they thought that Sun Quan had no right to be emperor, and so they urged the Shu government to break ties with Wu. Although Zhuge Liang agreed that Sun Quan lacked legitimacy, he considered that the Wu–Shu alliance was vital to Shu&#x27;s survival and long-term interests because they needed Wu to help them keep Wei occupied in the east while they attacked Wei in the west. After concluding that Shu should maintain the Wu–Shu alliance and refrain from criticising Sun Quan, he sent Chen Zhen on a diplomatic mission to Wu to recognise Sun Quan&#x27;s claim to the throne and congratulate him.

===Ziwu Campaign===
In August 230, Cao Zhen led an army from Chang&#x27;an to attack Shu via the Ziwu Valley (). At the same time, another Wei army led by Sima Yi, acting on Cao Rui&#x27;s order, advanced towards Shu from Jing Province by sailing along the Han River. The rendezvous point for Cao Zhen and Sima Yi&#x27;s armies was at Nanzheng County (; in present-day Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Other Wei armies also prepared to attack Shu from the Xie Valley () or Wuwei Commandery.

When he heard of Wei recent movements, Zhuge Liang urged Li Yan to lead 20,000 troops to Hanzhong Commandery to defend against the Wei invasion which he reluctantly accepted after much persuasion. As Xiahou Ba led the vanguard of this expedition through the 330 km Ziwu Trail (), he was identified by the local residents who reported his presence to the Shu forces. Xiahou Ba barely managed to retreat after reinforcements from the main army arrived.

Zhuge Liang also allowed Wei Yan to lead troops behind the ennemy lines towards Yangxi (; southwest of present-day Wushan County, Gansu) to encourage the Qiang people to join Shu Han against Wei. Wei Yan greatly defeated Wei forces led by Guo Huai and Fei Yao. Following those events, the conflict became a prolonged stalemate with few skirmishes. After more than a month of slow progress and by fear of significant losses and waste of resources, more and more Wei officials sent memorials to end the campaign. The situation wasn&#x27;t helped by the difficult topography and constant heavy rainy weather lasting more than 30 days. Cao Rui decided to abort the campaign and recalled the officers by October 230.

===Battle of Mount Qi===

In 230, Zhuge Liang launched the fourth Northern Expedition and attacked Mount Qi (; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) again. He used the wooden ox, a mechanical device he invented, to transport food supplies to the frontline. The Shu forces attacked Tianshui Commandery and surrounded Mount Qi, which was defended by the Wei officers Jia Si () and Wei Ping (魏平). At Mount Qi, Zhuge Liang managed to convince Kebineng, a Xianbei tribal leader, to support Shu in the war against Wei. Kebineng went to Beidi Commandery (北地郡; around present-day central Shaanxi) and rallied the locals to support Shu.

At the time, as Grand Marshal Cao Zhen was ill, Cao Rui ordered the general Sima Yi to move to Chang&#x27;an to supervise the Wei defences in the Guanzhong region against the Shu invasion. After making preparations for battle, Sima Yi, with Zhang He, Fei Yao, Dai Ling (戴陵) and Guo Huai serving as his subordinates, led Wei forces to Yumi County (; east of present-day Qianyang County, Shaanxi) and stationed there. He then left Fei Yao and Dai Ling with 4,000 troops to guard Shanggui County (; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu), while he led the others to Mount Qi to help Jia Si and Wei Ping.

When Zhuge Liang learnt of the Wei forces&#x27; approach, he split his forces into two groups – one group to remain at Mount Qi while he led the other group to attack Shanggui County. He defeated Guo Huai, Fei Yao and Dai Ling in battle and ordered his troops to collect the harvest in Shanggui County. In response, Sima Yi turned back from Mount Qi, headed to Shanggui County, and reached there within two days. By then, Zhuge Liang and his men had finished harvesting the wheat and were preparing to leave. Zhuge Liang encountered Sima Yi at Hanyang () to the east of Shanggui County, but they did not engage in battle: Zhuge Liang ordered his troops to make use of the terrain and get into defensive positions; Sima Yi ordered his troops to get into formation, while sending Niu Jin to lead a lightly armed cavalry detachment to Mount Qi. The standoff ended when Zhuge Liang and the Shu forces retreated to Lucheng (), took control of the hills in the north and south, and used the river as a natural barrier.

Although his subordinates repeatedly urged him to attack the enemy, Sima Yi was hesitant to do so after seeing the layout of the Shu camps in the hills. However, he eventually relented when Jia Si and Wei Ping mocked him and said he would become a laughing stock if he refused to attack. Sima Yi then sent Zhang He to attack the Shu camp in the south, guarded by Wang Ping, while he led the others to attack Lucheng head-on. In response, Zhuge Liang ordered Wei Yan, Wu Ban and Gao Xiang to lead troops to engage the enemy outside Lucheng. The Wei army lost the battle, along with 3,000 troops and some equipment.

Despite his victory, Zhuge Liang could not make use of the momentum to launch a major offensive on the enemy because his army was running low on supplies. Sima Yi launched another attack on the Shu camps and succeeded in breaking through Zhuge Liang&#x27;s defences. The &quot;Book of Jin&quot; recorded that as Zhuge and the Shu army retreated under the cover of night, Sima Yi led his forces in pursuit and inflicted over 10,000 casualties on the enemy. This account from the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; is disputed by historians and is not included in the 11th-century monumental chronological historical text &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;.

In any case, according to &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, Zhuge Liang retreated to the Shu because of lack of supply, not defeat, Zhang He led his troops to attack the retreating Shu forces but fell into an ambush and lost his life.

===Battle of Wuzhang Plains===

In the spring of 234, Zhuge Liang led more than 100,000 Shu troops out of Xie Valley () and camped at the Wuzhang Plains on the south bank of the Wei River near Mei County (; southeast of present-day Fufeng County, Shaanxi). Aside from using the flowing horse to transport food supplies to the frontline, he implemented a &quot;tuntian&quot; plan by ordering his troops to grow crops alongside civilians at the south bank of the Wei River. He also forbid his troops from taking the civilians&#x27; crops.

In response to the Shu invasion, the Wei general Sima Yi led his forces and another 20,000 reinforcements to the Wuzhang Plains to engage the enemy. After an initial skirmish and a night raid on the Shu camp, Sima Yi received orders from the Wei emperor Cao Rui to hold his ground and refrain from engaging the Shu forces. The battle became a stalemate. During this time, Zhuge Liang made several attempts to lure Sima Yi to attack him. On one occasion, he sent women&#x27;s ornaments to Sima Yi to taunt him. An apparently angry Sima Yi sought permission from Cao Rui to attack the enemy, but was denied. Cao Rui even sent Xin Pi as his special representative to the frontline to ensure that Sima Yi followed orders and remained in camp. Zhuge Liang knew that Sima Yi was pretending to be angry because he wanted to show the Wei soldiers that he would not put up with Zhuge Liang&#x27;s taunting, and to ensure that his men were ready for battle.

During the stalemate, when Zhuge Liang sent a messenger to meet Sima Yi, Sima Yi asked the messenger about Zhuge Liang&#x27;s daily routine and living conditions. The messenger said that Zhuge Liang consumed three to four &quot;sheng&quot; of grain a day and that he micromanaged almost everything, except trivial issues like punishments for minor offences. After hearing this, Sima Yi remarked, &quot;How can Zhuge Kongming expect to last long? He&#x27;s going to die soon.&quot;

==Death and post-mortem events (234)==

The stalemate at the Wuzhang Plains lasted for over 100 days. Sometime between 11 September and 10 October 234, Zhuge Liang became critically ill and died in camp. He was 54 (by East Asian age reckoning) at the time of his death.

Sun Sheng&#x27;s &quot;Jin Yangqiu&quot; () recorded the following account: 

The &quot;Book of Wei&quot; (魏書) and &quot;Han–Jin Chunqiu&quot; () gave different accounts of where Zhuge Liang died. The former recorded that Zhuge Liang vomited blood in frustration when his army ran out of supplies during the stalemate and he ordered his troops to burn down their camp and retreat into a valley, where he fell sick and died. The latter recorded that he died in the residence of a certain Guo family. In his annotations to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s biography, Pei Songzhi pointed out that the &quot;Wei Shu&quot; and &quot;Han–Jin Chunqiu&quot; accounts were wrong, and that Zhuge Liang actually died in camp at the Wuzhang Plains. He also rebutted the &quot;Wei Shu&quot; account as follows: 

When Sima Yi heard from civilians that Zhuge Liang had died from illness and the Shu army had burnt down their camp and retreated, he led his troops in pursuit and caught up with them. The Shu forces, on Yang Yi and Jiang Wei&#x27;s command, turned around and readied themselves for battle. Sima Yi pulled back his troops and retreated. Some days later, while surveying the remains of the Shu camp, Sima Yi remarked, &quot;What a genius he was!&quot; Based on his observations that the Shu army made a hasty retreat, he concluded that Zhuge Liang had indeed died, so he led his troops in pursuit again. When Sima Yi reached Chi&#x27;an (), he asked the civilians living there about Zhuge Liang and heard that there was a recent popular saying: &quot;A dead Zhuge (Liang) scares away a living Zhongda&quot; He laughed and said, &quot;I can predict the thoughts of the living but I can&#x27;t predict the dead&#x27;s.&quot;

==Burial and posthumous honours==
Before his death, Zhuge Liang said that he wanted to be buried as simply as possible in Mount Dingjun (in present-day Mian County, Hanzhong, Shaanxi): his tomb should be just large enough for his coffin to fit in; he was to be dressed in the clothes he wore when he died; he did not need to be buried with any decorative objects or ornaments. Liu Shan issued an imperial edict to mourn and eulogise Zhuge Liang, as well as to confer on him the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Zhongwu&quot; (; &quot;loyal martial marquis&quot;).

Zhuge Liang once wrote a memorial to Liu Shan as follows and kept his promise until his death: 

In the spring of 263, Liu Shan ordered a memorial temple for Zhuge Liang to be built in Mianyang County (; present-day Mian County, Shaanxi). Initially, when Zhuge Liang died in 234, many people wanted the Shu government to build memorial temple to honour him. However, after some discussion, the government decided not to because it was not in accordance with Confucian rules of propriety. In his works, Sima Guang noted that during the Han era, only emperors were worshiped at temples. With no official channels to worship Zhuge Liang, the people took to holding their own private memorial services for Zhuge Liang on special occasions. Some time later, some people pointed out that it was appropriate to build a memorial temple for Zhuge Liang in Chengdu, but the Shu emperor Liu Shan refused. Two officials, Xi Long (習隆) and Xiang Chong, then wrote a memorial to Liu Shan and managed to convince him to build the memorial temple in Mianyang County.

In the autumn of 263, during the Wei invasion of Shu, the Wei general Zhong Hui passed by Zhuge Liang&#x27;s memorial temple in Mianyang County along the way and paid his respects there. He also ordered his troops to refrain from farming and logging anywhere near Zhuge Liang&#x27;s tomb at Mount Dingjun.

==Guo Chong&#x27;s five anecdotes==
The &quot;Shu Ji&quot; (), by Wang Yin (王隱), recorded that sometime in the early Jin dynasty, Sima Jun (司馬駿; 232–286), the Prince of Fufeng (), once had a discussion about Zhuge Liang with his subordinates Liu Bao (劉寶), Huan Xi () and others. Many of them brought up negative points about Zhuge Liang: making a bad choice when he chose to serve under Liu Bei; creating unnecessary burden and stress for the people of Shu; being overly ambitious; and lacking awareness about the limits of his strengths and abilities. However, there was one Guo Chong () who dissented and argued that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s brilliance and wisdom exceeded that of Guan Zhong and Yan Ying. He then shared five anecdotes about Zhuge Liang which he claimed nobody had heard of. Liu Bao, Huan Xi and the others fell silent after hearing the five anecdotes. Sima Jun even generously endorsed the five anecdotes by Guo Chong.

Pei Songzhi, when annotating Zhuge Liang&#x27;s official biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, found the five anecdotes unreliable and questionable, but he still added them into Zhuge Liang&#x27;s biography and pointed out the problems in each of them. In his concluding remarks, Pei Songzhi noted that the fourth-century historians Sun Sheng and Xi Zuochi, given their attention to detail, most probably came across Guo Chong&#x27;s five anecdotes while doing research on the Three Kingdoms period. He surmised that Sun Sheng and Xi Zuochi probably omitted the anecdotes in their writings because they, like him, also found the anecdotes unreliable and questionable.

===Harsh laws===
In the first anecdote, Guo Chong claimed that Zhuge Liang incurred much resentment from the people when he implemented harsh and draconian laws in Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). Fa Zheng, an adviser to Liu Bei, tried to dissuade Zhuge Liang from doing so as he believed that the harsh and draconian laws would drive a wedge between the people of Yi Province and Liu Bei&#x27;s government. He further pointed out that the government lacked popular support and political legitimacy at the time because some people saw Liu Bei as a foreign invader who occupied Yi Province by military force. Fa Zheng then urged Zhuge Liang to relax the laws and give the people some &quot;breathing space&quot;. In response, Zhuge Liang argued that harsh laws were necessary to restore law and order in Yi Province and help Liu Bei&#x27;s government consolidate its control over the territories and people. He blamed Liu Yan&#x27;s &#x27;soft&#x27; rule and Liu Zhang&#x27;s incompetence for allowing corruption and decadence to become deeply entrenched in Yi Province. He also argued that the best way to set things right was to restore law and order and to regulate the distribution of honours and privileges among the population.

Pei Songzhi pointed out three problems in this anecdote. First, when Fa Zheng and Liu Bei were still alive, Zhuge Liang was never in a position powerful enough for him to implement such a policy; he would have to be the Governor of Yi Province () to do so, but he only became Governor of Yi Province (in addition to other appointments) during Liu Shan&#x27;s reign. Second, as Zhuge Liang is known for being a respectful, humble and faithful subject, it seemed totally out of place for him to advocate such a policy and make such a crude response to Fa Zheng. Third, good governance, which Zhuge Liang is known for, is not normally associated with harsh laws.

===Assassination attempt on Liu Bei===
In the second anecdote, Guo Chong claimed that Cao Cao once sent an assassin to kill Liu Bei. When the assassin first met Liu Bei, he could only speak to Liu Bei from a distance, so he thought of a way to attract Liu Bei&#x27;s attention and get up close. He started analysing the situation in Cao Cao&#x27;s domain and presented ideas to Liu Bei on how to attack it. Liu Bei found his ideas interesting and asked him to come closer. Just then, Zhuge Liang came into the meeting room and caused the assassin to panic. He noticed the assassin&#x27;s facial expression and found him suspicious. The assassin then excused himself, saying that he needed to use the latrine, Liu Bei told Zhuge Liang, &quot;I found an extraordinary man who can be a good assistant to you.&quot; When Zhuge Liang asked who it was, Liu Bei said, &quot;The man who just went to the latrine.&quot; Zhuge Liang took a deep breath and said, &quot;Just now, I saw a look of fear and panic on his face. His avoidance of eye contact and his body language show that he has something evil on his mind. He must be an assassin sent by Cao Cao.&quot; Liu Bei immediately ordered the assassin&#x27;s arrest but the assassin had already fled.

Pei Songzhi pointed out the problems in this anecdote. If this incident really happened, the assassin must be a great talent to be able to attract Liu Bei&#x27;s attention and, in Liu Bei&#x27;s opinion, worthy enough to serve as an assistant to Zhuge Liang. However, this was unlikely because assassins were typically rough and boorish men ready to sacrifice their lives to accomplish their mission. Besides, it did not make much sense for a man of such talent to be an assassin when he could be better off as an adviser to any of the great warlords. Moreover, as Cao Cao was known for respecting and cherishing talents, it was unlikely that he would willingly sacrifice someone of such talent by sending him on a risky mission. Furthermore, given the significance of this incident, it should be recorded in history, but there is no mention of it in the official histories.

===Empty Fort Strategy===
Guo Chong&#x27;s third anecdote concerns Zhuge Liang&#x27;s alleged use of the Empty Fort Strategy against Sima Yi at Yangping ().

===Rejecting compliments===
In the fourth anecdote, Guo Chong claimed that when Zhuge Liang returned to Chengdu after the first Northern Expedition, he received many compliments from his colleagues for his successes in capturing a few thousand Wei families and making Jiang Wei defect to Shu. However, to their surprise, Zhuge Liang solemnly replied, &quot;All the people under Heaven are people of the Han Empire. Now, the Han Empire isn&#x27;t revived yet and the people are still suffering from war. It will be my fault even if only one person dies due to war. I dare not accept compliments built on people&#x27;s miseries.&quot; The people of Shu then realised that his goal was to vanquish Wei rather than simply expanding Shu&#x27;s borders through conquests.

Pei Songzhi pointed out that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s goal of achieving a complete victory over Wei was already well known &quot;before&quot; he went on the first Northern Expedition, so it seemed very odd for Guo Chong to say that the people of Shu only realised it &quot;after&quot; Zhuge Liang came back from the first Northern Expedition. He also noted that the first Northern Expedition was an overall failure so the &quot;successes&quot; mentioned in this anecdote neither made sense nor were worthy of compliments. The reasons he gave were as such: Shu lost two battles against Wei in the first Northern Expedition and ultimately failed to conquer the three commanderies; Wei had nothing to lose from the defection of Jiang Wei, who at the time was a relative nobody; and the capture of the few thousand Wei families was insufficient to make up for the casualties the Shu forces suffered at Jieting and Ji Valley.

===Earning the trust of soldiers===
In the fifth anecdote, Guo Chong claimed that during the fourth Northern Expedition, when Zhuge Liang led Shu forces to attack Mount Qi, the Wei emperor Cao Rui decided to launch a counterattack on Shu, so he personally led his forces to Chang&#x27;an. He then ordered Sima Yi and Zhang He to lead 300,000 elite Wei soldiers from Yong and Liang provinces on a covert operation deep into Shu territory and launch a stealth attack on Jiange (; in present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), a strategic mountain pass. Around the time, Zhuge Liang had set up a rotating shift system, in which at any time 20 percent of his troops (about 80,000 men) would be stationed at Mount Qi, while the remaining 80 percent would remain behind. As the Wei forces approached Mount Qi and prepared to attack the Shu positions, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s subordinates urged him to stop the rotating shift system and concentrate all the Shu forces together to resist the numerically superior Wei forces. Zhuge Liang replied, &quot;When I lead the troops into battle, I operate on the basis of trust. Even the ancients felt it was a shame for one to betray others&#x27; trust in him in order to achieve his goals. The soldiers who are due to return home can pack up their belongings and prepare to leave. Their wives have been counting the days and looking forward to their husbands coming home. Even though we are in a difficult and dangerous situation now, we shouldn&#x27;t break our earlier promise.&quot; When the homebound soldiers heard that they were allowed to go home, their morale shot up and they became more motivated to stay back and fight the Wei forces before going home. They talked among themselves and pledged to use their lives to repay Zhuge Liang&#x27;s kindness. Later, during the battle, they fought fiercely and killed Zhang He and forced Sima Yi to retreat. Zhuge Liang won the battle because he successfully gained the trust of the Shu soldiers.

Pei Songzhi pointed out that this anecdote contradicted the accounts from historical records. During the fourth Northern Expedition, Cao Rui was indeed at Chang&#x27;an, but he did not personally lead Wei forces into battle. As for the part about Cao Rui ordering Sima Yi and Zhang He to lead a 300,000-strong army to attack Jiange, Pei Songzhi argued that it never happened because it was extremely unlikely for such a large army to pass through the Guanzhong region, bypass Zhuge Liang&#x27;s position at Mount Qi, and enter Shu territory completely undetected. He also found the part about the rotating shift system untrue because it was impossible for a Shu expeditionary force to enter Wei territory and remain there for so long, much less set up a rotating shift system.

==Family and descendants==








;Spouse
Zhuge Liang married the daughter of Huang Chengyan, a reclusive scholar living south of the Han River. The &quot;Xiangyang Ji&quot; (襄陽記) recorded that Huang Chengyan once asked Zhuge Liang, &quot;I heard you are looking for a wife. I have an ugly daughter with yellow hair and dark skin, but her talent matches yours.&quot; Zhuge Liang then married Huang Chengyan&#x27;s daughter. At the time, there was a saying in their village: &quot;Don&#x27;t be like Kongming when you choose a wife. He ended up with [Huang Chengyan]&#x27;s ugly daughter.&quot; Although her name was not recorded in history, she is commonly referred to in popular culture by the name &quot;Huang Yueying&quot; ().

;Children
* Zhuge Qiao (諸葛喬; 199–223), Zhuge Liang&#x27;s nephew and adopted son. As Zhuge Liang initially had no son, he adopted Zhuge Qiao, the second son of his elder brother Zhuge Jin. Zhuge Qiao served as a military officer in Shu and died relatively early.
* Zhuge Zhan (諸葛瞻; 227–263), Zhuge Liang&#x27;s first son. He served as a military general in Shu and married a daughter of the Shu emperor Liu Shan. He was killed in battle in 263 during the Wei invasion of Shu.
* Zhuge Huai (), Zhuge Liang&#x27;s third son. He is mentioned only in the &quot;Zhuge Family Genealogy&quot; (諸葛氏譜) cited in the 1960 publication &quot;Collected Works of Zhuge Liang&quot; (諸葛亮集). In 269, during the Jin dynasty, Emperor Wu summoned the descendants of famous Han dynasty officials (e.g. Xiao He, Cao Shen) to the imperial court so that he could confer honorary titles on them. When Zhuge Liang&#x27;s descendants did not show up, Emperor Wu sent his officials to find them. The officials found Zhuge Huai in Chengdu and brought him to Emperor Wu. Zhuge Huai declined the honour, saying that he was contented with the land and property he already owned at the time. Emperor Wu was pleased and he did not force Zhuge Huai to accept.
* Zhuge Guo (諸葛果), Zhuge Liang&#x27;s daughter. She is mentioned only in the 1960 publication &quot;Collected Works of Zhuge Liang&quot; (諸葛亮集) and the Ming dynasty Daoist text &quot;Lidai Shenxian Tongjian&quot; (歷代神仙通鑑; &quot;Comprehensive Mirror on Immortals Through the Dynasties&quot;). Her father named her &quot;guo&quot; (; &quot;fulfil / realise&quot;, basic meaning &quot;fruit / result&quot;) because he wanted her to learn Daoist magical arts and fulfil her destiny of becoming an immortal.

;Grandchildren and great-grandchildren
* Zhuge Pan (諸葛攀), Zhuge Qiao&#x27;s son. In 253, after Zhuge Ke (Zhuge Jin&#x27;s first son) and his family were exterminated in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Eastern Wu, Zhuge Pan reverted from his adopted lineage (Zhuge Liang&#x27;s) to his biological lineage (Zhuge Jin&#x27;s) and went to Eastern Wu to continue Zhuge Jin&#x27;s family line there.
* Zhuge Shang (諸葛尚; died 263), Zhuge Zhan&#x27;s eldest son. He was killed in battle in 263 alongside his father during the Wei invasion of Shu.
* Zhuge Jing (諸葛京), Zhuge Zhan&#x27;s second son. After the fall of Shu, he moved to Hedong Commandery in 264 together with Zhuge Pan&#x27;s son, Zhuge Xian (諸葛顯), and later served as an official under the Jin dynasty after being summoned in April 269.
* Zhuge Zhi (諸葛質), a son of Zhuge Zhan. He is mentioned only in the &quot;Zaji&quot; () cited in the 1960 publication &quot;Collected Works of Zhuge Liang&quot; (). After the fall of Shu, Liu Xun (劉恂; a son of Liu Shan) was unwilling to accompany his father to Luoyang, so he sent Zhuge Zhi as a messenger to meet Meng Qiu (), Meng Huo&#x27;s son, and seek permission to live with the Nanman tribes. Meng Qiu approved.

;Others
* Zhuge Dan (諸葛誕; died 258), a cousin of Zhuge Liang, served in Cao Wei as a high-ranking military general in the mid Three Kingdoms period. Between 257 and 258, he started a rebellion in Shouchun against the Wei regent Sima Zhao, but ended up being defeated and killed.

==Appraisal and legacy==
===Holding power as a regent===
After Liu Bei&#x27;s death, Liu Shan ascended to the throne of Shu Han. He granted Zhuge Liang the title &quot;Marquis of Wu District&quot; () and created an office for him as a Chancellor. Not long later, Zhuge Liang was appointed Governor of Yi Province – the region which included most of Shu Han&#x27;s territory.

Being both the Chancellor (directly managing the bureaucrat officers) and provincial governor (directly managing the common people) meant that both the magistrates and common people – all civil affairs in Yi Province – were in the hands of Zhuge Liang. Having an independent Chancellery Office with attached independent subordinates meant that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s authority was relatively independent of the emperor&#x27;s authority. In other words, just as attested in &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, all of Shu Han&#x27;s affairs, trivial or vital, were directly handled by Zhuge Liang, and the emperor Liu Shan was just a nominal leader. Moreover, the emperor himself was strictly educated and supervised by Zhuge Liang. This situation was maintained until Liang&#x27;s death.

There are many attempts who tried to explain why Zhuge Liang refused to return the authority to Liu Shan. Yi Zhongtian proposed three reasons:
# Zhuge Liang supported the model of the emperor only indirectly lead the country and have a Chancellor to handle the affairs in his name, similar to the situation during the Western Han. In his opinion, if the emperor directly handled the affairs, then there would be no one to blame if problems occurred, but a Chancellor could bear responsibility and punishment for failure.
# Zhuge Liang stubbornly thought that Liu Shan was not experienced enough to directly handle the state affairs, considered too important to risk error.
# The situation of Shu Han was indeed very complicated at that time which required extremely well-planned solutions. An inexperienced Liu Shan could not handle such challenging problems, but Zhuge Liang could.

===Economic reforms===
Yi Province&#x27;s wealthy families, unchecked by previous governors, freely exploited the common people and lived in extravagance. As a result, poverty was widespread, and economic–political reform was the most important concern for Zhuge Liang. A robust economic foundation was also necessary to enhance the people&#x27;s loyalty to Shu Han regime and properly support the future&#x27;s expeditions against Cao Wei. Therefore, Zhuge Liang made it clear that the core value of his policy was to stabilize and improve the life of the people.

Zhuge Liang&#x27;s new policies were enacted during the reign of Liu Bei and continued in the time of Liu Shan. He purged corrupt officials, reduced taxes, and restricted the aristocracy&#x27;s abuse of power against the common people. Corvée labour and military mobilization were also reduced and rescheduled to avoid the disruption of agriculture activities, and Cao Cao&#x27;s &quot;tuntian&quot; system of state-run agricultural colonies was implemented extensively to increase food production output. Agriculture dykes were significantly rebuilt and repaired, including the eponymous Zhuge dyke north of Chengdu. Thanks to the reforms, Shu Han agriculture production grew significantly, sufficient to sustain an active military.

Salt manufacture, silk production, and steelmaking – three major industries in Shu – also attracted Zhuge Liang&#x27;s attention. Liu Bei, following the proposal of Zhuge Liang, created specialized bureaus for managing salt and steel manufacture, initially directed by Wang Lian and Zhang Yi, respectively. A specialized silk management bureau was also established, and silk production experienced significant growth, leading to Chengdu being nicknamed &quot;the city of Silk&quot;. Over the lifetime of the Shu Han state, it accumulated 200,000 pieces of silk in the national treasury. &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; reported that salt production in Shu Han was highly prosperous and generated significant income to the government. Fu Yuan, a well-known local metalsmith, was appointed to a role in metallurgy research by Zhuge Liang, and managed to improve the techniques in crafting steel weapons for the Shu Han army.

Due to political turmoil, monetary systems at the end of the Han dynasty were in severe turbulence. When establishing themselves in the Yi Province, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang, following the advice of Liu Ba, enacted successful monetary reforms. The new Shu Han currency was not only smoothly circulated within its borders, but also popular in the neighboring Jing province. Meanwhile, similar policies of Cao Pi, Cao Rui, and Sun Quan were marred by difficulties and achieved limited success.

===Legal and moral reforms===
Zhuge Liang strongly supported the rule of law in Shu Han. Yi Zhongtian commented that &quot;Rule of Laws&quot; together with &quot;Nominal rule of the Monarch and direct rule of the Chancellor&quot; are two important legacies of Zhuge Liang which were unfortunately forgotten by many people.

After Liu Bei took over Yi province, Zhuge Liang, together with Fa Zheng, Liu Ba, Li Yan and Yi Ji, wrote the legal codes for Shu Han.

In order to curb the corruption and attendant decadence of the local Yi aristocracy, Zhuge Liang enacted a Legalist policy with strict but fair and transparent laws, and restricted the power of wealthy families. Zhuge Liang was willing to punish high-ranked magistrates such as Li Yan, his own close associates such as Ma Su, and even willing to demote himself to keep legal order. However he also refrained from abusing punishment and required extreme caution in law enforcement. Xi Zuochi praised Zhuge Liang&#x27;s policy of legal rule, that &quot;since the era of Qin and Han there had been no one as equal.&quot; Even punished magistrates like Li Yan and Liao Li highly regarded Zhuge Liang and strongly believed that he would re-employ them after the punishment was enough.

Zhuge Liang also promoted moral conduct and himself led a strict and stoic life as a model. He did not own excessive assets, refrained from luxurious spending, and relied mainly on government salary. Shu Han&#x27;s magistrates, like Deng Zhi, Fei Yi, Jiang Wei, Zhang Yi also followed suit, strictly abiding by the legal and moral codes, enabling the Shu government to maintain a high level of transparency and integrity. Yi Zhongtian praised Shu Han as the best model of &quot;rational rule&quot; amongst the Three Kingdoms, and it is the incorruptibility and transparency of Zhuge Liang and his associates that kept Shu Han from collapsing under a heavy burden of expenditure.

Not everybody was happy with such Legalist policies. Guo Chong&#x27;s characterised Zhuge Liang&#x27;s policy &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;exploitative&quot;, claiming &quot;everybody from the noble to the commoner&quot; was upset. Pei Songzhi disagreed with such comments, considering Zhuge Liang&#x27;s law enforcement appropriate and rejecting claims of exploitation. Guo Chong&#x27;s perspective also contradicted Chen Shou&#x27;s comment that &quot;nobody was upset despite the strict laws&quot;. Yi Zhongtian commented that both contradictory assessments were correct, as Shu people were happy about Zhuge Liang&#x27;s fairness and transparency, but some of them were also upset about his strictness. Moreover, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s fairness and legal rule inevitably suppressed the local aristocracy, preventing them from abusing their power and manipulate politics and public opinion. That is the reason why many of the local Shu intellegistia tacitly endorsed the invasion of Wei against Shu, although they also respected Zhuge Liang. This is supported by contemporary sources, including Zhang Wen and Sun Quan. Yuan Zhun of the Jin dynasty also highly appraised Zhuge Liang&#x27;s administration skills and popularity, where people would still sing praises to Zhuge Liang decades after his death.

===Education and talents enrollment policy===
Zhuge Liang greatly appreciated talent, hence he paid strong attention to education in order to cultivate and recruit more talented magistrates for the Shu Han government. He established the position Aide of Learning Encouragement (勸斈從事), held by many prominent local intelligentsia such as Qiao Zhou, who held this post for a very long time and was very influential. Chen Shou was one of his students. Later Zhuge Liang established a Great Education Residence (太斈府), a training facility using Confucian literature as textbooks. He also created many &quot;reading book residences&quot; both in Chengdu and in his encampments during the northern expeditions; such facilities functioned as places where talented people could be discovered and recruited. Yao Tian, Shu Han&#x27;s governor of Guanghan district, managed to recommend many talented people to the government, to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s lavish praise.

Zhuge Liang also established &quot;Discussion Bureau&quot; mechanism to gather all the discussions of a certain policy, encourage magistrates to accept the criticisms of their subordinates, and utilize the talents of all employees to reach the best decision. Zhuge Liang adopted a meritocratic promotion system, promoting and assessing people based on deeds and ability rather than fame or background.

===Inventions===
Zhuge Liang was believed to be the inventor of the Chinese steamed bun, the land mine and a mysterious but efficient automatic transportation device (initially used for grain) referred to as the &quot;wooden ox and flowing horse&quot; (木牛流馬), which is sometimes identified with the wheelbarrow.

Although he is often credited with the invention of the repeating crossbow that is named after him and called the &quot;Zhuge Crossbow&quot; (諸葛弩), this type of semi-automatic crossbow is an improved version of a model that first appeared during the Warring States period. There is debate over whether the original Warring States period bow was semi-automatic, or rather shot multiple bolts at once. Nevertheless, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s improved model could shoot farther and faster.

Zhuge Liang is also credited with constructing the Stone Sentinel Maze, an array of stone piles that is said to produce supernatural phenomena, near Baidicheng. An early type of hot air balloon used for military signalling, known as the Kongming lantern, is also named after him. It was said to have been invented by Zhuge Liang when he was trapped by Sima Yi in Pingyang. Friendly forces nearby saw the message on the lantern paper covering and came to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s aid. Another belief is that the lantern resembled Zhuge Liang&#x27;s headdress, so it was named after him.

===Literary works===
Some books popularly attributed to Zhuge Liang can be found today, for example the &quot;Thirty-Six Stratagems&quot; and &quot;Mastering the Art of War&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;The Art of War&quot; attributed to Sun Tzu). Supposedly, his mastery of infantry and cavalry formation tactics based on the classic &quot;I Ching&quot;, was unrivalled. His memorial &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot;, written prior to the Northern Expeditions, provided a salutary reflection of his unswerving loyalty to the state of Shu. The memorial moved some readers to tears. In addition, he wrote &quot;Admonition to His Son&quot; (諸葛亮誡子書) in which he reflected on his humility and frugality in pursuit of a meaningful life.

Zhuge is also the subject of many Chinese literary works. Poems by the prolific and highly regarded Tang dynasty poet Du Fu were written in memory of him, whose legacy of unwavering dedication seems to have been forgotten in Du&#x27;s generation, judging by the description of Zhuge&#x27;s neglected temple. Two such pieces were written as part of Du Fu&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Kuizhou poems&quot;.

Another poem of Du Fu was also written to praise Zhuge Liang at his Baidicheng temple.
Du Fu&#x27;s quatrain &quot;Eightfold Battle Formation&quot; () about Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Stone Sentinel Maze, is collected in the &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;.

===Notable quotes===
The phrase &quot;Han and bandits do not stand together&quot; () from the Later &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot; is often used to draw a line in the sand and declare a situation where one cannot stand with evil. Notably, this phrase was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s favorite quote to invoke to justify his anti-communist ideology.

Another phrase &quot;deference and prudence, to a state of depletion, are never finished until death&quot; () from the Later &quot;Chu Shi Biao&quot; is often used to describe commitment and perseverance to strive to the utmost.

One famous line of poetry, &quot;Who is the first, awakened from the Great Dream? As always, I&#x27;m the one who knows.&quot; (), was also attributed to Zhuge Liang.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
The 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong romanticises the historical figures and events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Zhuge Liang is characterised as a brilliant strategist who can perform fantastical achievements such as summoning advantageous winds and devising magical stone mazes.

There is great confusion on whether the stories are historical or fictional. At minimum the Empty Fort Strategy is based on historical records, albeit not attributed to Zhuge Liang historically. For Chinese people, the question is largely irrelevant, as the Zhuge Liang of lore is regardless seen as a mastermind, whose examples continue to influence many layers of Chinese society. They are also argued, together with Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot;, to still greatly influence the modern Chinese strategical, military and everyday thinking.

In Moss Roberts&#x27;s translation of the novel, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s appearance is described as follows: The original Chinese text in the novel mentions that Zhuge Liang wore a &quot;guanjin&quot; (綸巾; a type of hat) and a &quot;hechang&quot; (鶴氅; a robe commonly worn by Daoists).

See the following for the stories in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; involving Zhuge Liang.

* Zhuge Liang&#x27;s diplomatic mission to Jiangdong
* Borrowing arrows with straw boats, in which decoy boats stuffed with straw are used to steal thousands of arrows from Cao Cao&#x27;s archers. In earlier versions of this story, Sun Quan or Zhou Yu takes the role of protagonist later given to Zhuge Liang.
* Zhuge Liang prays for the eastern wind, where the wind that fans the flames destroying Cao Cao&#x27;s fleet at Red Cliffs is due to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s magic spell
* Meng Huo captured and released seven times, a further embellishment upon the story transmitted in Xi Zuochi&#x27;s work

===Events before Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death===
When Zhuge Liang fell critically ill during the Battle of Wuzhang Plains, he attempted a ritual to extend his lifespan by twelve years. However, he failed when the ritual was disrupted by Wei Yan, who rushed in to warn him about the enemy&#x27;s advance. Before his death, Zhuge Liang also passed his &quot;24 Volumes on Military Strategy&quot; (兵法二十四篇) to Jiang Wei, who would continue his legacy and lead another eleven campaigns against the Cao Wei state.

==Worship of Zhuge Liang==
There are many temples and shrines built to commemorate Zhuge Liang. Some of the most famous ones include the Temple of the Marquis of Wu in Chengdu, and the Temple of the Marquis of Wu in Baidicheng.

Zhuge Liang is also sometimes venerated as a door god at Chinese and Taoist temples, usually in partnership with Sima Yi of Wei.

<text>Lü Meng () (178 – January or February 220), courtesy name Ziming, was a Chinese military general and politician who served under the warlord Sun Quan during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. Early in his career, he fought in several battles under the banner of Sun Ce, Sun Quan&#x27;s elder brother and predecessor. Although he had been noted for his bravery, he was still deemed as nothing more than a &quot;mere warrior&quot; for his lack of literacy skills. Later, with encouragement from Sun Quan, Lü Meng took up scholarly pursuits to improve himself, gradually becoming a learned and competent military leader. In 217, he succeeded Lu Su as the frontline commander of Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in Jing Province. Two years later, in a carefully calculated military operation, Lü Meng led an invasion of Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in southern Jing Province, swiftly and stealthily capturing all the lands from Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, who was captured and executed after his defeat. Lü Meng enjoyed his finest hour after the victory but died a few months later because he was already seriously ill before the campaign.

==Early life==
Lü Meng was from Fupo County (), Runan Commandery (), which is located southeast of present-day Funan County, Anhui. His family migrated to the south of the Yangtze River when Lü Meng was young. Lü Meng lived with his brother-in-law, Deng Dang (), who served as a military officer under Sun Ce. When he was 14 or 15, he secretly followed Deng Dang to the battles against the Shanyue tribes. Deng Dang was shocked to see his teenage brother-in-law in battle, so he scolded Lü Meng and warned him to stop. Lü Meng refused to listen so Deng Dang told Lü Meng&#x27;s mother about this. When she wanted to punish him, Lü Meng said: &quot;It is difficult to survive in poverty. If we can prove ourselves through hard work, then wealth will come eventually. How can we catch the tiger cub if we don&#x27;t enter the tiger&#x27;s den?&quot; Lü Meng&#x27;s mother sighed and let him have his way.

At the time, an official scorned Lü Meng because of his young age and often insulted him by saying things like: &quot;What can he do? His behaviour will only result in him feeding himself to the tigers.&quot; Lü Meng killed the official one day when he lost control of his anger. Initially, he took shelter under Zheng Chang () but later turned himself in to Yuan Xiong (), a colonel under Sun Ce. Yuan Xiong pleaded with his lord to spare Lü Meng&#x27;s life. Sun Ce interviewed Lü Meng and was so impressed with him that he pardoned Lü Meng and appointed him as a close aide.

A few years later, after Deng Dang died, Zhang Zhao recommended Lü Meng to replace Deng Dang, so Lü Meng was appointed as a Major of a Separate Command (). In the year 200, after Sun Ce was assassinated, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him as the warlord ruling the territories in the Jiangdong region. Sun Quan planned to reorganise his army by merging small units into larger garrisons. When Lü Meng heard about it, he collected funds to purchase elaborately designed armour for his troops. When Sun Quan came to inspect Lü Meng&#x27;s unit, he was so impressed that he placed more soldiers under Lü Meng&#x27;s command, thus saving Lü Meng&#x27;s troops from being merged into another unit.

Lü Meng participated in Sun Quan&#x27;s conquest of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡; around present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) and made many contributions in battle. He was promoted to Commandant Who Pacifies the North () and appointed as the Chief () of Guangde County.

==Battle of Jiangxia==
In the spring of 208, Lü Meng was assigned to be the navy commandant when Sun Quan launched a campaign against Huang Zu, the Administrator () of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day eastern Hubei). During the battle, Ling Tong and Dong Xi destroyed Huang Zu&#x27;s two large &quot;mengchong&quot;s while Lü Meng&#x27;s unit defeated Huang Zu&#x27;s navy. Lü Meng killed Huang Zu&#x27;s subordinate Chen Jiu () in the midst of battle. Huang Zu attempted to flee after learning of Chen Jiu&#x27;s death, but was captured by Sun Quan&#x27;s soldiers. After the battle, Sun Quan deemed Lü Meng&#x27;s contributions to be the most significant because Chen Jiu&#x27;s death secured their victory. Lü Meng was promoted to General of the Household Who Sweeps Across the Wilderness () and awarded 10 million coins.

==Red Cliffs campaign==
In the winter of 208, Lü Meng participated in the Battle of Red Cliffs, in which the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei defeated the forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao at Wulin (烏林; in present-day Honghu, Hubei). Cao Cao perfunctorily retreated to northern China, leaving behind his general Cao Ren to defend Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei). Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, led by Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, pressed on their attack and besieged Cao Ren in Nan Commandery.

Around the time, Xi Su (), a military officer from Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), brought along his men to defect to Sun Quan&#x27;s side. Zhou Yu proposed to Sun Quan to let Lü Meng take charge of Xi Su&#x27;s troops. However, Lü Meng praised Xi Su as a courageous person and declined to take over command of Xi Su&#x27;s men. He believed it was disrespectful to do so because Xi Su had come a long way to join them. Sun Quan agreed with Lü Meng and returned Xi Su&#x27;s troops to him.

During the siege of Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to lead a detachment to take control of Yiling (夷陵; present-day Yichang, Hubei), but Gan Ning came under attack by a separate enemy force led by Cao Ren&#x27;s subordinates. When Gan Ning sent a messenger to Zhou Yu&#x27;s camp to request for relief forces, most of Sun Quan&#x27;s officers saw that they did not have enough men to spare, so they refused to help Gan Ning. Lü Meng, however, insisted on saving Gan Ning. He told Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu: &quot;I suggest we leave Ling Tong behind while I follow you to help Gan Ning. It is imperative that we lift the siege (on Gan Ning) because he may not be able to hold out for long. I assure you that Ling Tong can defend our current position for at least ten days.&quot;

Lü Meng also suggested to Zhou Yu to send 300 men to block the enemy&#x27;s retreat route with huge logs. When the reinforcements arrived at Yiling, they killed over half of the total number of enemy troops and forced the surviving ones to retreat at night. However, the enemy encountered the huge logs and were unable to cross over on horseback, so they had to dismount and proceed on foot. Sun Quan&#x27;s pursuing forces arrived at the blockade and seized about 300 horses left behind by the enemy, which they transported back to their camp on boats. The morale of Zhou Yu&#x27;s army improved greatly, so they crossed the Yangtze River, set up a garrison near the enemy base, and then engaged Cao Ren&#x27;s forces in battle. Cao Ren lost the battle and eventually ordered his troops to abandon their position and retreat. Sun Quan&#x27;s forces captured Nan Commandery and gained control over central Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). Upon his return, Lü Meng was promoted to Lieutenant-General () and appointed as the Prefect () of Xunyang County (尋陽縣; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei).

==Scholarly pursuits==
The &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; () recorded that Sun Quan once told Lü Meng and Jiang Qin: &quot;Both of you are commanders now so you should enrich yourself with knowledge.&quot; Lü Meng replied: &quot;I have many things to attend to in the army, so I am afraid I won&#x27;t have time to read.&quot; Sun Quan then said: Lü Meng was so inspired by Sun Quan&#x27;s words that he began to study diligently and acquire more knowledge. He eventually surpassed some Confucian scholars in terms of the number of texts he read.

===Meeting with Lu Su===
In 210, after Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu (who died of illness earlier that year) as the frontline commander of Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, he passed by Lü Meng&#x27;s garrison on his way to Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). Lu Su had all along regarded Lü Meng with contempt, but someone told him: &quot;General Lü&#x27;s fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn&#x27;t view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon.&quot; Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng&#x27;s camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, &quot;You have received an important appointment and you are going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?&quot; Lu Su lackadaisically replied, &quot;I will adapt to the situation when the time comes.&quot; Lü Meng then said: &quot;The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?&quot; Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su on how to deal with Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to Lü Meng, placed his hand on his shoulder and said, &quot;Lü Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here.&quot; He also visited Lü Meng&#x27;s mother and became friends with Lü Meng.

===&quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; account===
The &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; recorded a slightly different account of the meeting between Lu Su and Lü Meng. Lu Su placed his hand on Lü Meng&#x27;s shoulder and said: &quot;I heard you were previously a mere warrior. But now, you have taken up scholarly pursuits and you are no longer that Meng under Wu.&quot; Lü Meng replied: He then presented three strategies to Lu Su on how to counter Guan Yu. Lu Su respected Lü Meng so he kept the strategies to himself and did not reveal them.

The Chinese idioms &quot;Ah Meng from Wu&quot; () and &quot;rub one&#x27;s eyes and look&quot; () originated from this conversation. The former is used to describe an unlearned person who achieves improvement through diligent study while the latter means to see a person in a different light, especially after the person has made remarkable improvement.

==Battles of Wan County and Ruxu==
Cao Cao appointed Xie Qi () as the Agricultural Officer () of Qichun County and ordered him to station at Wan County (皖縣; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui) to harass the border of Sun Quan&#x27;s domain. Lü Meng tried to induce Xie Qi into surrendering but failed, so he attacked Xie Qi. Xie Qi lost the battle and retreated. His subordinates, Sun Zicai () and Song Hao (), brought along several civilians and surrendered to Lü Meng.

In 213, Lü Meng followed Sun Quan to Ruxu (濡須; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui) to guard against Cao Cao&#x27;s advances. Sun Quan wanted to construct a dock at Ruxu, but his subordinates said, &quot;We should land on the other side of the river and attack the enemy, then return to our ships. Why build a dock?&quot; However, Lü Meng supported the idea of building a dock and he said: &quot;Battles are unpredictable and we might not always win. If we lose and the enemy closes in, and we don&#x27;t have time to retreat to the riverbank, how can we even board our ships?&quot; Sun Quan agreed with Lü Meng and had the dock constructed to make boardings and landings more convenient. With this, Sun Quan&#x27;s army defended their positions against Cao Cao&#x27;s approaching forces, who retreated after several failed attempts to overcome the enemy.

==Battle of Lujiang==
Around 214, Cao Cao retreated from Ruxu, he appointed Zhu Guang () as the Administrator () of Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; around present-day Lujiang County, Anhui) and ordered him to station at Wan County (皖縣; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui). Zhu Guang developed the area for agricultural use, while bribing bandits from Poyang County to cause trouble in Sun Quan&#x27;s territories. Lü Meng warned Sun Quan: &quot;The lands in Wan County are very fertile so the enemy&#x27;s numbers will rise after they gain a bountiful harvest. Within a few years time, Cao Cao&#x27;s military prowess would have increased significantly, so we should eliminate them soon.&quot; Sun Quan heeded Lü Meng&#x27;s advice and personally led a campaign to attack Lujiang Commandery. Before the battle, Sun Quan summoned all his officers and asked them for their opinions.

The officers suggested to pile up earth to form small hills and replenish their equipment. However, Lü Meng disagreed: &quot;It will take several days to build the hills and replenish our equipment. By then, the enemy would have reinforced their defences and their relief forces would have arrived, and we can&#x27;t defeat them. The rainwater has flowed in, and the water level will subside if we linger on for days. By then, it will be very difficult for our ships to retreat and we may be in danger. As of now, I observe that the fortress&#x27;s defences are weak, so we can achieve victory if we attack it from all directions when our army&#x27;s morale is still high. We can retreat via the water route after that. That&#x27;s the way to secure total victory.&quot; Sun Quan heeded Lü Meng&#x27;s suggestion.

Lü Meng recommended Gan Ning to lead the assault on Wan County while he followed behind with the elite troops. When they attacked at dawn, Lü Meng himself beat a war drum to boost the soldiers&#x27; morale. They captured the fortress by noon. Around the same time, Cao Cao&#x27;s general Zhang Liao was leading reinforcements from Hefei to help Zhu Guang. When he reached Jiashi (), he heard that Wan County had fallen to the enemy so he withdrew his troops. Sun Quan praised Lü Meng for his bravery and appointed him as the Administrator of Lujiang Commandery. Lü Meng gained 600 households from Xunyang County (尋陽縣; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei) for his &quot;tuntian&quot; system and had 30 more subordinates placed under his command.

When Lü Meng returned to Xunyang County, he heard that some bandits were causing trouble in Luling Commandery (廬陵郡; southwest of present-day Ji&#x27;an, Jiangxi), and that many of Sun Quan&#x27;s officers had been unsuccessful in defeating the bandits. Sun Quan remarked: &quot;A hundred birds of prey are not comparable to one osprey.&quot; He then ordered Lü Meng to attack the bandits. Lü Meng achieved success and killed the bandit chiefs but released the others and allowed them to revert to normal civilian life.

==Sun–Liu territorial dispute==
Around 212, Sun Quan&#x27;s ally Liu Bei embarked on a campaign to seize control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. He left Guan Yu behind to defend his territories in southern Jing Province during his absence. After Liu Bei completely took over Yi Province in 214, Sun Quan perceived that he was &quot;lending&quot; territories in Jing Province to Liu Bei per an earlier agreement in 210 so he wanted the territories back because Liu Bei already had a new base in Yi Province. When Liu Bei refused, Sun Quan ordered Lü Meng to lead troops to seize three commanderies – Changsha (), Lingling (零陵; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (桂陽; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan).

Lü Meng wrote to the administrators of the three commanderies to ask them to submit to Sun Quan. They all agreed except Lingling&#x27;s administrator, Hao Pu (). Liu Bei returned to Jing Province when he heard of Lü Meng&#x27;s advances and garrisoned troops at Gong&#x27;an County while ordering Guan Yu to lead an army to take back the three commanderies. At the time, Sun Quan was at Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei) and he sent Lu Su to lead 10,000 troops to Yiyang to block Guan Yu. Sun Quan also sent an urgent order to Lü Meng, ordering him to give up on Lingling and lead his troops to Yiyang to assist Lu Su.

When Lü Meng pacified Changsha, he passed by Ling County (酃縣; east of present-day Hengyang, Hunan) and met Deng Xuanzhi (), an old friend of Hao Pu. He planned to use Deng Xuanzhi to trick Hao Pu into surrendering. That night, Lü Meng summoned all his officers and gave them instructions on how to attack Lingling the following morning, without telling them that Sun Quan had given orders for them to give up on Lingling and move to Yiyang. He lied to Deng Xuanzhi that Liu Bei was besieged in Hanzhong by Cao Cao&#x27;s general Xiahou Yuan and that Guan Yu was occupied in a battle at Nan Commandery. He then asked Deng Xuanzhi to help him persuade Hao Pu to give up on Lingling. Deng Xuanzhi went to see Hao Pu later and conveyed Lü Meng&#x27;s message. Hao Pu became afraid when he heard that he had been isolated, so he agreed to surrender and asked Deng Xuanzhi to lead him to Lü Meng. When Lü Meng met Hao Pu, he revealed the truth, clapped his hands and laughed. Hao Pu became wrecked with guilt when he learnt that both Liu Bei and Guan Yu were actually free to reinforce Lingling but it was too late. Lü Meng left Sun He () behind to guard the three commanderies while he headed towards Yiyang per Sun Quan&#x27;s order.

The territorial dispute between Sun Quan and Liu Bei was eventually resolved when both sides agreed to divide Jing Province between their respective domains along the Xiang River. Sun Quan released Hao Pu and returned Lingling Commandery to Liu Bei. Lü Meng received Xunyang () and Yangxin () counties as his personal estate.

==Battles of Xiaoyao Ford and Ruxu==
In 214, after returning from Jing Province, Lü Meng joined Sun Quan in a campaign to conquer Hefei, which was defended by Cao Cao&#x27;s general Zhang Liao. By 215, Sun Quan&#x27;s forces had failed to breach Hefei&#x27;s walls and had also sustained heavy casualties in the earlier engagements with the enemy. When a plague broke out in his army, Sun Quan decided to withdraw. While retreating, Sun Quan was caught up in a fierce counterattack by Zhang Liao, but managed to break out of the encirclement and reach safety when his officers, including Lü Meng, fought with their lives to protect their lord at all costs.

Later, in 217, Cao Cao personally led a large army to invade Sun Quan&#x27;s garrison at Ruxu (濡須; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui). Sun Quan led his forces to resist the enemy and placed Lü Meng in charge of the army. Lü Meng arrived at the dock, which was constructed earlier in 213, and stationed thousands of archers there to rain arrows on the enemy when they approached. He also attacked the camp of Cao Cao&#x27;s vanguard force before the enemy established a foothold and succeeding in destroying the camp. Cao Cao saw that he could not overcome Sun Quan and eventually retreated. Lü Meng was promoted to General of Tiger&#x27;s Might () and appointed as Left Protector of the Army ().

==Succeeding Lu Su==
In 217, when Lu Su died, Lü Meng took over command of the former&#x27;s troops, numbering over 10,000, and moved west to the garrison at Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). Lü Meng was also appointed as the Administrator () of Hanchang Commandery (漢昌郡; southeast of present-day Pingjiang County, Hunan) and received Xiajun (), Liuyang (), Hanchang and Zhouling () counties as his personal marquisate. He was stationed near the Sun-Liu border, which was guarded by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu on the other side. Lü Meng was aware of Guan Yu&#x27;s military prowess and his intention of seizing Sun Quan&#x27;s territories in Jing Province. He also knew that Guan Yu was in a strategic position on the upstream of the Yangtze River. He recognised that the temporary stability and truce between Sun Quan and Liu Bei would not last long.

Previously, Lu Su had advocated the maintenance of friendly relations between Sun Quan and Liu Bei to sustain their alliance against Cao Cao. Lü Meng wrote a secret letter to Sun Quan: 

Sun Quan agreed with Lü Meng and wanted to accept his suggestion. Later, he sought Lü Meng&#x27;s advice on attacking Cao Cao in Xu Province, to which Lü Meng replied: Sun Quan thought that Lü Meng&#x27;s advice was appropriate so he heeded it.

When Lü Meng was at Lukou, he treated his neighbours generously and maintained friendly ties with Guan Yu.

==Invasion of Jing Province==
In 219, Guan Yu led an army to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s fortress at Fancheng (樊城; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), which was defended by Cao Ren. He left behind his subordinates Shi Ren and Mi Fang to defend Gong&#x27;an County and Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) respectively. When Lü Meng heard about that, he wrote to Sun Quan: Sun Quan agreed to Lü Meng&#x27;s plan and played along by openly approving his request to return to Jianye for medical treatment.

Guan Yu fell for the ruse and withdrew the backup forces and advanced towards Fancheng. When Cao Cao heard of the attack at Fancheng, he sent Yu Jin to lead an army to relief Cao Ren, but Yu Jin lost the battle and surrendered to Guan Yu. Guan Yu&#x27;s troops increased in numbers after his victory so he lacked food supplies. He sent his men to seize grain from one of Sun Quan&#x27;s depots along the Xiang River. When Sun Quan heard about it, he sent Lü Meng ahead to invade Jing Province while he followed up behind. Lü Meng arrived at Xunyang County (尋陽縣; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei), where he ordered his elite soldiers to disguise themselves as merchants and sail towards Nan Commandery. On the journey, they captured the watchtowers set up by Guan Yu along the river to prevent the defenders from learning of their approach. Guan Yu was totally unaware of this. Shi Ren, who was defending Gong&#x27;an County, surrendered to Lü Meng after Yu Fan, an official under Sun Quan, persuaded him to do so. Earlier on, Guan Yu had punished Mi Fang for negligently causing some weapons to be destroyed in a fire. Although the incident was over, Mi Fang still feared Guan Yu. Lü Meng showed understanding towards Mi Fang and convinced him to surrender as well.

After entering Nan Commandery, Lü Meng treated the civilian population well, among whom included family members of Guan Yu&#x27;s troops. He also gave strict orders to his men, forbidding them from disturbing the people. In one incident, Lü Meng executed one of his soldiers for stealing from a civilian household, even though that soldier was an old acquaintance of his. He shed tears after that. This incident shocked the other soldiers in Lü Meng&#x27;s unit and they did not dare to defy his orders. Lü Meng won the hearts of the people by showing kindness towards them – he provided necessities such as food and clothing to the elderly and the poor, and distributed medicine to the sick. He also ordered the treasury in the commandery office to be sealed up while they awaited Sun Quan&#x27;s arrival.

Guan Yu was returning to Nan Commandery when he heard that his territories in Jing Province had fallen to Lü Meng. He sent messengers to meet Lü Meng, who brought them on a tour of the city. When the messengers returned to Guan Yu, they spread the word that their families were well. Guan Yu&#x27;s troops lost their fighting spirit after hearing that Lü Meng treated their families better than how Guan Yu treated them in the past. Guan Yu knew that he had lost and was isolated, so he withdrew to Maicheng (麥城; around present-day Maicheng Village, Lianghe Town, Dangyang, Hubei). When they reached Zhang District () in the west, Guan Yu&#x27;s men deserted and surrendered to Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. Sun Quan sent Zhu Ran and Pan Zhang to block Guan Yu&#x27;s retreat route. Guan Yu and his son Guan Ping were captured by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in an ambush and subsequently executed. Liu Bei lost all his territories in Jing Province to Sun Quan.

==Death==
For his achievements in the conquest of Jing Province, Lü Meng was appointed as the Administrator () of Nan Commandery. He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Chanling () and awarded 100 million coins and 500 &quot;jin&quot; of gold. Earlier on, Sun Quan threw a feast at Gong&#x27;an County to celebrate the victory, but Lü Meng did not want to attend because he was ill. Sun Quan laughed and said: &quot;Ziming, you deserve the honour of capturing Guan Yu. You have achieved victory but haven&#x27;t received any reward yet, so how can you leave now?&quot; He ordered the soldiers to play music, and personally selected subordinates for Lü Meng and the equipment required for the ceremony. After the ceremony, all the soldiers lined up along the path when Lü Meng took his leave, with music playing in the background. That was Lü Meng&#x27;s finest hour.

Lü Meng rejected the coins and gold, but Sun Quan insisted that he accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong&#x27;an County then, so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 &quot;jin&quot; of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng.

Sun Quan became more worried as Lü Meng&#x27;s condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but felt that it was too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng&#x27;s room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night when he saw that Lü Meng did not eat anything. When Lü Meng&#x27;s condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng&#x27;s lifespan. Despite Sun Quan&#x27;s efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong&#x27;an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng&#x27;s death.

Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their prized possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.

==Family==
Lü Meng&#x27;s marquis title was inherited by his son, Lü Ba (). Lü Ba received 50 &quot;qing&quot; of land and 300 households to help him keep watch over his father&#x27;s tomb. After Lü Ba died, his elder brother Lü Cong () succeeded him and inherited the marquis title. Lü Cong, in turn, passed on the marquis title to his younger brother, Lü Mu (), after his death.

==Anecdotes==

===Incident with Cai Yi===
In his younger days, Lü Meng was not competent in reading and writing. Whenever he issued orders, he had to verbally instruct his subordinates or ask someone to help him write. Cai Yi (), the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery, scorned him because of that. However, Lü Meng never hated Cai Yi for treating him with contempt. When Gu Shao (), the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery, died, Lü Meng recommended Cai Yi to Sun Quan to replace Gu Shao. Sun Quan laughed and asked Lü Meng, &quot;Are you trying to be like Qi Xi?&quot; He heeded Lü Meng&#x27;s suggestion.

===Tolerating Gan Ning===
Lü Meng was unhappy with Gan Ning, a general under Sun Quan, because of his violent and murderous ways. There was one incident where Lü Meng was so furious with Gan Ning that he wanted to kill him. Gan Ning also infuriated Sun Quan on a number of occasions when he defied his lord&#x27;s orders. When Lü Meng heard about it, he told Sun Quan: &quot;The Empire has yet to be pacified. Fierce generals like Gan Ning are hard to come by. You should tolerate him.&quot; Sun Quan heeded Lü Meng&#x27;s advice and treated Gan Ning generously. In return, Gan Ning served Sun Quan faithfully until his death.

==Appraisal==
Sun Quan once said: &quot;A person improves as he grows older. Lü Meng and Jiang Qin are two excellent examples. They have obtained wealth and glory, yet they are willing to pick up reading and scholarly pursuits. They view material wealth lightly and value righteousness.&quot; On another occasion, he said: &quot;When Ziming was young, I said he was someone who didn&#x27;t give in to adversity, he was indeed courageous but only so. When he grew older, he became more knowledgeable and resourceful, and was second to Gongjin, but less capable in debate and literary arts as compared to Gongjin. When he defeated and captured Guan Yu, he did better than Lu Zijing.&quot;

Chen Shou, who wrote Lü Meng&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on him as follows: &quot;Lü Meng was courageous and witty, decisive and well-versed in military strategy. Deceiving Hao Pu and capturing Guan Yu – those were his finest moments. Initially, he was rash and reckless, but eventually he managed to exercise self-restraint. He possessed the magnanimity of a great statesman and was not a mere warrior! Sun Quan&#x27;s comments on Lü Meng, both positive and negative, were befitting, hence I included them in this record.&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Lü Meng appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. His death is dramatised in chapter 77 of the novel.

Sun Quan and his subjects are celebrating their conquest of Jing Province, with Lü Meng receiving the highest honour. During the banquet, Guan Yu&#x27;s spirit suddenly possesses Lü Meng, grabs Sun Quan and shouts, &quot;Green-eyed brat! Purple-bearded coward, do you still recognise me?&quot; Sun Quan&#x27;s subordinates immediately rush forth to save their lord. The possessed Lü Meng shoves Sun Quan away and sits on his seat. With a furious expression on his face, he booms, &quot;Since defeating the Yellow Turban rebels, I have fought in wars for over 30 years. But I lost my life because you used an evil scheme against me. I can&#x27;t feast on your flesh when I was still alive, but I can still seize Lü Meng&#x27;s soul after death! I am Guan Yunchang, the Marquis of Hanshou Village.&quot; Sun Quan and the others are so terrified that they sink to their knees. Lü Meng collapses and dies, bleeding from seven body orifices. Everyone is traumatised by the scene they witnessed.

==In popular culture==
Lü Meng is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. In the games, his name is spelled as &quot;Lu Meng&quot; without the diaeresis in the &quot;U&quot; in &quot;Lu&quot;. He also appears in all instalments of Koei&#x27;s strategy game series &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

The fictional character Ryomou Shimei of the anime and manga series &quot;Ikki Tousen&quot; is based on Lü Meng.

Lü Meng appears in Total War: Three Kingdoms as a playable character within Sun Ce&#x27;s faction.

<text>Harry Christopher Caray (; March 1, 1914 – February 18, 1998) was an American radio and television sportscaster. During his career he called the play-by-play for five Major League Baseball teams, beginning with 25 years of calling the games of the St. Louis Cardinals (with two of those years also spent calling games for the St. Louis Browns). After a year working for the Oakland Athletics and 11 years with the Chicago White Sox, Caray spent the last 16 years of his career as the announcer for the Chicago Cubs.

==Early life==
Caray was born Harry Christopher Carabina to an Italian father and Romanian mother in St. Louis. He was 14 when his mother, Daisy Argint, died from complications due to pneumonia. Caray did not have much recollection of his father, who went off to fight in World War I. Caray went to live with his uncle John Argint and Aunt Doxie at 1909 LaSalle Avenue. Caray attended high school at Webster Groves High School. In his youth, Caray was said to be a talented baseball player . He possessed the tools to play at the next level; out of high school, the University of Alabama offered Caray a spot on its team. Due to financial woes, Caray could not accept. Around this time, World War II was occurring. Caray tried to enlist into the Armed Forces, but was denied due to his poor eyesight. Not being able to advance professionally on the playing side of baseball, instead he sold gym equipment before looking to another avenue to keep his love of baseball alive: using his voice. He then spent a few years learning the trade at radio stations in Joliet, Illinois, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. While in Joliet, WCLS station manager Bob Holt suggested that Harry change his surname from Carabina (because according to Holt, it sounded too awkward on the air) to Caray.

==Career==

===St. Louis Cardinals and Browns===

Caray caught his break when he landed a job with the National League St. Louis Cardinals in 1945 and, according to several histories of the franchise, proved as adept at selling the sponsor&#x27;s beer as at the play-by-play description. Caray teamed with former major-league catcher Gabby Street to call Cardinals games through 1950, as well as those of the American League St. Louis Browns in 1945 and 1946. His subsequent partners in the Cardinals&#x27; booth included Stretch Miller, Gus Mancuso, Milo Hamilton, Joe Garagiola, and Jack Buck.

Immediately preceding the Cardinals job, Caray announced hockey games for the St. Louis Flyers, teaming with former NHL defenseman Ralph &quot;Bouncer&quot; Taylor. On one occasion, Taylor temporarily ended his retirement when he volunteered to play goalie for the Flyers in a regular season game with the team from Minnesota. Caray was also seen as influential enough that he could affect team personnel moves; Peter Golenbock (in &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis: A History of the St. Louis Cardinals and Browns&quot;) has suggested that Caray may have had a partial involvement in the maneuvering that led to the exit of general manager Bing Devine, the man who had assembled the team that won the 1964 World Series, and of field manager Johnny Keane, whose rumored successor, Leo Durocher (the succession didn&#x27;t pan out), was believed to have been supported by Caray for the job. Caray, however, stated in his autobiography that he liked Johnny Keane as a manager, and did not want to be involved in Keane&#x27;s dismissal. As the Cardinals&#x27; announcer, Caray helped broadcast three World Series (1964, 1967, and 1968) on NBC. He also broadcast the 1957 All-Star Game (played in St. Louis) on NBC Radio, and had the call for Stan Musial&#x27;s 3,000th hit on May 13, 1958.

In November 1968, Caray was nearly killed after being struck by an automobile while crossing a street in St. Louis; he suffered two broken legs in the accident, but recuperated in time to return to the broadcast booth for the start of the 1969 season. Gussie Busch, the Cardinals&#x27; president and then-CEO of team owners Anheuser-Busch, spent lavishly to ensure Caray recovered, flying him on the company&#x27;s planes to a company facility in Florida to rehabilitate and recuperate. On Opening Day, fans cheered when he dramatically threw aside the two canes he had been using to cross the field and continued to the broadcast booth under his own power.

Following the 1969 season, the Cardinals declined to renew Caray&#x27;s contract after he had called their games for 25 seasons, his longest tenure with any sports team. The team stated that the action had been taken on the recommendation of Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s marketing department, but declined to offer specifics. At a news conference afterward, during which he drank conspicuously from a can of Schlitz (then a major competitor to Anheuser-Busch), Caray dismissed that claim, saying no one was better at selling beer than he had been. Instead, he suggested, he had been the victim of rumors that he&#x27;d had an affair with Gussie Busch&#x27;s daughter-in-law.

===Oakland Athletics===
He spent one season broadcasting for the Oakland Athletics, in 1970, before, as he often told interviewers, he grew tired of owner Charles O. Finley&#x27;s interference and accepted a job with the Chicago White Sox. (Apparently the feeling was mutual; Finley later said that &quot;that shit [Caray] pulled in St. Louis didn&#x27;t go over here.&quot;) Finley wanted Caray to change his broadcast chant of &quot;Holy Cow&quot; to &quot;Holy Mule&quot;.

However, there were some reports that Caray and Finley did, in fact, work well with each other and that Caray&#x27;s strained relationship with the A&#x27;s came from longtime A&#x27;s announcer Monte Moore; Caray was loose and free-wheeling while Moore was more restrained and sedate.

Coincidentally, 54 years after that season, his great-grandson Chris would become a broadcaster for the club.

===Chicago White Sox===
Caray joined the Chicago White Sox in 1971 and quickly became popular with the South Side faithful and enjoying a reputation for joviality and public carousing (sometimes doing home game broadcasts shirtless from the bleachers). He wasn&#x27;t always popular with players, however; Caray had an equivalent reputation of being critical of home team blunders. During his tenure with the White Sox, Caray was teamed with many color analysts who didn&#x27;t work out well, including Bob Waller, Bill Mercer and ex-Major League catcher J. C. Martin, among others. But in 1976, during a game against the Texas Rangers, Caray had former outfielder Jimmy Piersall (who was working for the Rangers at the time) as a guest in the White Sox booth that night. The tandem proved to work so well that Piersall was hired to be Caray&#x27;s partner in the White Sox radio and TV booth beginning in 1977.

Among Caray&#x27;s experiences during his time with the White Sox was the infamous &quot;Disco Demolition Night&quot; promotion. On July 12, 1979, what began as a promotional effort by Chicago radio station WLUP, the station&#x27;s popular DJ Steve Dahl, and the Sox to sell seats at a White Sox/Detroit Tigers double-header resulted in a debacle. As Dahl blew up a crate full of disco records on the field after the first game had ended, thousands of rowdy fans from the sold-out event poured from the stands onto the field at Comiskey Park. Caray and Piersall, via the public address system, tried to calm the crowd and implored them to return to their seats, in vain. Eventually the field was cleared by Chicago Police in riot gear and the White Sox were forced to forfeit the second game of the double-header due to the extensive damage done to the playing field. Caray left the White Sox after the 1981 season, replaced by Don Drysdale. However, the popular Caray was soon hired by the crosstown Chicago Cubs for the 1982 season.

===Chicago Cubs===

Caray increased his renown after joining the North Side Cubs following the 1981 season. In contrast to the &quot;SportsVision&quot; concept, the Cubs&#x27; own television outlet, WGN-TV, had become among the first of the cable television superstations, offering their programming to providers across the United States for free, and Caray became as famous nationwide as he had long been on the South Side and, previously, in St. Louis. In fact, Caray had already been affiliated with WGN for some years by then, as WGN actually produced the White Sox games for broadcast on competitor WSNS-TV, and Caray was a frequent sportscaster on the station&#x27;s newscasts. Caray succeeded longtime Cubs broadcaster Jack Brickhouse, a beloved announcer and Chicago media fixture.

The timing worked in Caray&#x27;s favor, as the Cubs ended up winning the National League East division title in 1984 with WGN-TV&#x27;s nationwide audience following along. Millions came to love the microphone-swinging Caray, continuing his White Sox practice of leading the home crowd in singing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh inning stretch, mimicking his mannerisms, his gravelly voice, his habit of mispronouncing or slurring some players&#x27; names—which some of the players mimicked in turn—and even his trademark barrel-shaped wide-rimmed glasses.

In February 1987, Caray suffered a stroke while at his winter home near Palm Springs, California, just prior to spring training for the Cubs&#x27; 1987 season. This led to his absence from the broadcast booth through most of the first two months of the regular season, with WGN featuring a series of celebrity guest announcers on game telecasts while Caray recuperated.

Caray&#x27;s national popularity never flagged after that, although time eventually took a toll on him. Nicknamed &quot;The Mayor of Rush Street&quot;, a reference to Chicago&#x27;s famous tavern-dominated neighborhood and Caray&#x27;s well-known taste for Budweiser, illness and age began to drain some of Caray&#x27;s skills, even in spite of his remarkable recovery from the 1987 stroke. There were occasional calls for him to retire, but he was kept aboard past WGN&#x27;s normal mandatory retirement age, an indication of how popular he was. Toward the end of his career, Caray&#x27;s schedule was limited to home games and road trips to St. Louis and Atlanta.

In December 1997, Caray&#x27;s grandson Chip Caray was hired to share play-by-play duties for WGN&#x27;s Cubs broadcasts with Caray for the following season. However, Harry Caray died in February 1998, before the baseball season began, leaving the expected grandfather-grandson partnership in the broadcast booth unrealized.

===The seventh-inning stretch===
Caray is credited with popularizing the singing of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch.

Throughout his broadcasting career, Caray would sing the song in his booth. There would only be a few people who could hear Caray sing: his broadcast partners, WMAQ Radio producer Jay Scott, and the select fans whose seats were near the booth. Scott suggested that Caray&#x27;s singing be put on the stadium public address system, in the early 1970s, but Caray and station management rejected the idea. When owner Bill Veeck took over the White Sox in 1976, he would observe Caray and some fans singing the song and wanted to incorporate Caray into a stadium-wide event.

It was a few games into the 1976 season when Veeck secretly placed a public-address microphone into Caray&#x27;s booth and turned it on once Nancy Faust, the Comiskey Park organist, began playing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, so that everyone in the park could hear Caray singing. Veeck asked Caray if he would sing regularly, but the announcer initially wanted no part of it. Veeck advised Caray that he had already taped the announcer singing during commercial breaks and said he could play that recording if Caray preferred. When Caray questioned the idea, Veeck explained, &quot;Anybody in the ballpark hearing you sing ‘Take Me Out to the Ball Game’ knows that he can sing as well as you can. Probably better than you can. So he or she sings along. Hell, if you had a good singing voice, you&#x27;d intimidate them, and nobody would join in.&quot;

Caray finally agreed to sing it live, accompanied by Faust on the organ, and went on to become famous for singing the tune, continuing to do so at Wrigley Field after becoming the broadcaster of the Chicago Cubs, using a hand-held microphone and holding it out outside the booth window.

Many of these performances began with Caray speaking directly to the baseball fans in attendance either about the state of the day&#x27;s game, or the Chicago weather, while the park organ held the opening chord of the song. Then with his trademark opening, &quot;All right! Lemme hear ya! Ah-One! Ah-Two! Ah-Three!&quot; Harry would launch into his distinctive, down-tempo version of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot;. During his tenure announcing games at Comiskey Park and later Wrigley Field, he would often replace &quot;root, root, root for the home team&quot; with &quot;root, root, root for the White Sox/Cubbies&quot;. For the lyrics &quot;One, Two, Three, strikes you&#x27;re out ...&quot; Caray would usually hold the microphone out to the crowd to punctuate the climactic end of the song. And if the visitors were ahead in that game, Harry would typically make a plea to the home team&#x27;s offense: &quot;Let&#x27;s get some runs!&quot;

After Caray died in 1998, the Cubs would bring in guest conductors of the song; this tradition is still alive to this day. His wife, Dutchie, as well as his grandson Chip Caray, were the first people to guest conduct the song following his death.

During the 2009 NHL Winter Classic at Wrigley Field, as the Chicago Blackhawks hosted the Detroit Red Wings on New Year&#x27;s Day 2009, former Blackhawks players Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, and Denis Savard and former Cubs players Ryne Sandberg and Ferguson Jenkins sang a hockey-themed version of the seventh-inning stretch; &quot;Take Me Out to the Hockey Game&quot; used lines such as &quot;Root, root, root for the Blackhawks&quot; and &quot;One, two, three pucks, you&#x27;re out.&quot; The Blackhawks would do this again in 2010 during the White Sox–Cubs game at Wrigley Field. This time, it was members of the Stanley Cup winning team.

Major League Baseball rolled out a holographic rendition of Caray performing the song for the Cubs&#x27; 2022 Field of Dreams Game against the Cincinnati Reds in Dyersville, Iowa. Reactions to the stunt were mixed, with many observers calling the hologram &quot;creepy&quot; and disrespectful.

===Personality and style===

Caray began his broadcasting career in St. Louis, where he was the third person at a local radio station. This meant that he was responsible for the commercials and quick breaks between the play-by-play announcers. His style of delivering the news was different from anybody else in St. Louis; he was critical, he told the truth and held nothing back. This style was typically only used in the newspaper business, so when Caray brought this style to the radio, his ratings and popularity rose exponentially. This led to him beginning to announce Cardinals games with Gabby Street.

Caray had a number of broadcasting partners and colleagues through the years. He had a frosty relationship with Milo Hamilton, his first partner with the Cubs, who felt Caray had pushed him out in St. Louis in the mid-1950s. Hamilton (who&#x27;d been the presumptive successor to Jack Brickhouse prior to Caray&#x27;s hiring) was fired by WGN in 1984; he claimed that station officials told him that the main reason was that Caray did not like him. However, Caray also did not lack for broadcast companions who enjoyed his work and companionship. With the White Sox, his longest-serving partner was Jimmy Piersall; with the Cubs, he was teamed for 14 years with former pitcher Steve Stone.

Caray was known for his unabashed homerism, showing absolute support of the team for which he announced. While advertisers played up his habit of openly rooting for the Cubs from the booth (for example, a 1980s Budweiser ad described him as &quot;Cub Fan, Bud Man&quot; in a Blues Brothers-style parody of &quot;Soul Man&quot;), he had been even less restrained about rooting for the Cardinals when he broadcast for them. He said later that his firing from the Cardinals changed his outlook and made him realize that his passion was for the game itself, and the fans, more than anything else. He was also famous for his frequently exclaimed catchphrase &quot;&quot;Holy cow!&quot;&quot; when his team hit a home run or turned a difficult play on field; he trained himself to use this expression to avoid any chance of accidentally using profanity on the air. Caray also avoided any risk of mis-calling a home run, using what became a trademark home run call: &quot;It might be ... it could be ... it IS! A home run! Holy cow!&quot; He first used the &quot;It might be ...&quot; part of that expression on the air while covering a college baseball tournament in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the early 1940s.

Caray was one of the first announcers to step out of the booth while broadcasting a game. Often with his tenure with both the Cubs and White Sox, he would set up in the outfield and broadcast the game from a table amongst the fans. Caray said, &quot;I am the eyes and ears of the fan. If I do not tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, the fan doesn’t want to know.&quot; During his tenure with the White Sox, Caray would often announce the game from the outfield bleachers, surrounded by beer cups and fans.

One of his favorite things to do was to find a member of the opposing team and try to say their name backwards. After Caray had a stroke in 1987, this did not occur as often as before. A video of Caray trying to say Mark Grudzielanek&#x27;s name backwards can be found online.

===Non-baseball work===
Though best known and honored for his baseball work, Caray also called ice hockey (St. Louis Flyers), basketball (St. Louis Billikens, Boston Celtics, and St. Louis Hawks), and college football (Missouri Tigers) in the 1940s, &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s. Additionally, he broadcast eight Cotton Bowl Classic games (1958–64, 1966) on network radio.

Caray had a reputation for mastering all aspects of broadcasting: writing his own copy, conducting news interviews, writing and presenting editorials, and hosting a sports talk program.

==Personal life==
Caray was the uncle of actor Tim Dunigan, known for playing many roles on both the screen and stage. His son Skip Caray followed him into the booth as a baseball broadcaster with the Atlanta Braves. Caray&#x27;s broadcasting legacy was extended to a third-generation, as his grandson Chip Caray replaced Harry as the Cubs&#x27; play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2004. Chip served as the Braves television announcer on Bally Sports South, with his brother Josh serving as Director of Broadcasting and Baseball Information for the minor league Rocket City Trash Pandas. Chip is currently a broadcaster for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Carays expanded to a fourth generation in 2022 when Chip&#x27;s twin sons Chris and Stefan were named broadcasters for the minor league Amarillo Sod Poodles. For the 2024 season, Chris was hired by NBC Sports California to broadcast the Oakland Athletics as one of two lead broadcasters (alternating) heading into the 2024 season.

On October 23, 1987, Harry Caray&#x27;s Italian Steakhouse opened in the Chicago Varnish Company Building, a Chicago Landmark building that is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There are seven restaurants and an off-premises catering division which bear the Harry Caray name.

===Rumored affair with Susan Busch===

Rumors that Caray was having an affair with Susan Busch, wife of August Busch III, the oldest son of Cardinals president Gussie Busch, then a company executive and later CEO of Cardinals&#x27; owner Anheuser-Busch, began to circulate after she was involved in a single-car accident near her home in the St. Louis suburb of Ladue late one night in May 1968. She told police she was returning from a visit to &quot;a friend&quot;; the cause of the accident was never disclosed publicly and no further action was taken. However, her marriage to the younger Busch was failing due to his extreme commitment to the family business.

According to Anheuser–Busch historian William Knoedelseder, the two had been seen eating together at Tony&#x27;s, a popular and well-regarded St. Louis restaurant (where Knoedelseder later worked, and heard the story from more senior staff). Waitstaff present said the two were both extremely inebriated and openly affectionate. They stood out not only because both were well-recognized around St. Louis but because Caray was 22 years older than her. The restaurant&#x27;s owner had to tell the staff not to stare at the couple.

It also was rumored that the near-fatal car accident Caray suffered later that year was actually intentional and related to the alleged affair. Private investigators working for Busch had found that telephone records showed Caray and Susan Busch had made many calls to each other. They supposedly confronted him about the reported affair while he was in Florida recuperating.

Susan divorced her husband shortly afterwards. She has only spoken about the alleged affair once since then, denying it. While she and the broadcaster were friends, &quot;we were not a romance item by any means&quot;, she told the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;. Caray cited the rumors of the affair as the real reason the Cardinals declined to renew his contract after the disappointing 1969 season.

Like Susan Busch, Caray, too, denied that the affair had occurred when asked, but according to Knoedelseder was less consistent, sometimes suggesting it had indeed occurred, and usually saying how flattered he was at the idea that a woman as attractive as Susan Busch would see him the same way.

==Death==
Harry Caray died on February 18, 1998, as a result of complications from a heart attack and brain damage. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, Caray and his wife, &quot;Dutchie&quot; Goldman, were at a Rancho Mirage, California, restaurant celebrating the holiday when Caray collapsed during the meal. Steve Stone&#x27;s 1999 publication &quot;Where’s Harry?&quot; suggests that Caray&#x27;s head made contact with the table, resulting in a loss of consciousness. This has never been confirmed, but is one possibility. Caray was rushed to nearby Eisenhower Medical Center, where he never woke up from his coma and died on February 18, 1998, 11 days away from his 84th birthday.

Caray&#x27;s funeral was held on February 27, 1998, at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago. The Chicago community came out to pay respect to the Hall of Fame announcer, including Chicago Cubs players Sammy Sosa, Mark Grace, manager Jim Riggleman, and ex-players Ryne Sandberg, Rick Sutcliffe, and Billy Williams. Illinois Governor Jim Edgar, Mayor Richard Daley, and Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka were also in attendance. 
The organist of Holy Name Cathedral, Sal Soria, did not have any sheet music to play the song Caray made famous in the broadcast booth, &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, which resulted in him borrowing the music. He said in a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article, &quot;I had to sort of somber it up and slow it down to make it a little more classy. Actually, it was kind of fun to do it.&quot; Caray&#x27;s wife, Dutchie, led the Wrigley Field crowd in singing the song at their first home game following Harry&#x27;s death; this tradition has continued with a different person singing the song at each Cubs home game to this day.

Harry Caray is buried at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois.

===Legacy===
Following his death, during the entire 1998 season the Cubs wore a patch on the sleeves of their uniforms depicting a caricature of Caray. Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa dedicated each of his 66 home runs that season to Caray.

Caray had five children, three with his first wife, Dorothy, and two with his second wife, Marian. He married his third wife Delores &quot;Dutchie&quot; (Goldmann) on May 19, 1975. His son Skip Caray followed him into the booth as a baseball broadcaster with the Atlanta Braves until his death on August 3, 2008. Caray&#x27;s broadcasting legacy was extended to a third generation, as his grandson Chip Caray replaced Harry as the Cubs&#x27; play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2004. Chip later returned to work with his father Skip on Atlanta Braves broadcasts, where he had worked for a while in the early 1990s. In 2022, Chip&#x27;s twin sons Chris and Stefan became minor league baseball broadcasters each at 22, joining the Amarillo Sod Poodles, the Texas League affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Chip would eventually sign to be the St. Louis Cardinals announcer in 2023, when at the end of the season Chris and Stefan were given assignments for the Arizona Fall League. The following season, Chris joined the Oakland Athletics&#x27; sportscast.

In what Harry Caray said was one of his proudest moments, he worked some innings in the same broadcast booth with his son and grandson, during a Cubs/Braves game on May 13, 1991. On-air in a professional setting, the younger men would refer to their seniors by their first names. During 1998, Chip would refer to the departed Harry in third person as &quot;Granddad&quot;, however he has now returned to referring to him as &quot;Harry&quot;.

When the Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians in seven games to win the 2016 World Series, Budweiser produced a celebratory commercial entitled &quot;Harry Caray&#x27;s Last Call&quot; featuring a fictional version of what might have been Caray&#x27;s call of the game, using archived footage stitched together.

==Honors and special events==
The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Caray as Missouri Sportscaster of the Year twice (1959, 1960) and Illinois Sportscaster of the Year 10 times (1971–73, 75–78, 83–85), and inducted him into its NSSA Hall of Fame in 1988.

In 1989, the Baseball Hall of Fame presented Caray with the Ford C. Frick Award for &quot;major contributions to baseball.&quot; That same year, he was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1990, and has his own star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

On June 24, 1994, the Chicago Cubs had a special day honoring Harry for 50 years of broadcasting Major League Baseball. Sponsored by the Cubs and Kemper Insurance, pins were given out to some unknown number of fans in attendance that day. The pins had a picture of Harry, with writing saying &quot;HARRY CARAY, 50 YEARS BROADCASTING, Kemper MUTUAL FUNDS&quot; and &quot;HOLY COW.&quot;

In 1994, Caray was the radio inductee into the NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame.

In 1999, a statue honoring Caray was erected outside of Wrigley Field, near the third base entrance at Sheffield Ave. and Addison St. It was relocated in 2010 to the corner of Sheffield and Waveland Avenues, just outside of the entrance to the stadium&#x27;s bleachers.

Caray&#x27;s style became fodder for pop culture parody as well, including a memorable &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; recurring sketch featuring Caray (played by Will Ferrell) in various &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segments opposite Norm Macdonald and Colin Quinn. Caray would frequently abandon the topic he was supposed to be talking about and would drift into hypothetical topics like whether or not they would eat the moon if it were made of spare ribs and turning hot dogs into currency (20 hot dogs would equal roughly a nickel, depending on the strength of the yen). The sketch continued after Caray&#x27;s death. When asked by SNL guest host Joan Allen about his death, Will Ferrell as Caray replied, &quot;What&#x27;s your point?&quot; &quot;The Bob and Tom Show&quot; also had a Harry Caray parody show called &quot;After Hours Sports&quot;, which eventually became &quot;Afterlife Sports&quot; after Caray&#x27;s death, and the Heaven and Hell Baseball Game, in which Caray is the broadcast announcer for the games. On the Nickelodeon series &quot;Back at the Barnyard&quot;, news reporter Hilly Burford bears a strong resemblance to Caray, both in appearance and speech. In 2005, the cartoon &quot;&quot; had two announcers reporting a baseball game. One was a parody of Caray, the other, Howard Cosell. The recurring character &quot;Reverend Fantastic&quot; from the animated television series &quot;Bordertown&quot; bears an uncanny likeness to Caray in both appearance and speaking style. Another Caray impersonation was done by Chicago radio personality Jim Volkman, heard most often on the Loop and AM1000.

Caray can be briefly heard in the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, as a Cubs game is shown on a TV in a pizza parlor.

In 2008, a series of Chicago-area TV and radio ads for AT&amp;T&#x27;s Advanced TV featured comedian John Caponera impersonating the post-stroke version of Harry Caray. However, AT&amp;T soon withdrew the spots following widespread criticism and a complaint by Caray&#x27;s widow.

Atlanta Braves pitcher Will Ohman performed a Harry Caray impersonation when announcing the starting lineup for the Atlanta Braves during a &quot;Fox Game of the Week&quot; in 2008.

In 1988, Vess Beverage Inc. released and sold a Harry Caray signature soda, under the brand &quot;Holy Cow&quot;, complete with his picture on every can.

<text>Daron Malakian (; born July 18, 1975) is an American musician. He is the guitarist, songwriter, and second vocalist of the metal band System of a Down, and the lead vocalist, lead guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter of Daron Malakian and Scars on Broadway.

Malakian was ranked 47th in Loudwire″s list of &quot;Top 50 Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot; and number 11 in MusicRadar″s poll &quot;The 20 Greatest Metal Guitarists Ever&quot;. He placed 30th in &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

== Biography ==
Daron Malakian was born on July 18, 1975, in Hollywood, California, the only child to Armenian parents Vartan and Zepur Malakian. Vartan is a painter, dancer, and choreographer from Mosul, Iraq, and Zepur Malakian is a sculptor who instructed college-level sculpture earlier in her career. At an early age, Malakian got into heavy metal music; his distant cousin played him a Kiss record when he was age 4. Malakian started listening to Van Halen, Aerosmith, Def Leppard, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Motörhead and Ozzy Osbourne. He always wanted to play the drums, but his parents got him a guitar instead because &quot;You can&#x27;t turn the drums off.&quot; Malakian first picked up a guitar at age 11, saying in an interview, &quot;For the first year and a half, I learned how to play by ear, and did alright. After a few years I gained a reputation as a guitar player in high school. And by 16 or 17 I actually realized it was a good songwriting instrument, and, over anything, that&#x27;s what I feel like. I don&#x27;t pretend to be Mr. Guitar Virtuoso.&quot; During his teens Malakian listened to thrash metal bands such as Slayer, Venom, Metallica, and groove metal bands like Pantera and Sepultura. Malakian then began listening to the Beatles and cites John Lennon as one of his big influences as a songwriter. He also cites other British Invasion bands such as the Kinks and the Who as major influences as well as folk-rock such as trio Peter, Paul and Mary and punk pioneer Iggy Pop. Malakian went to Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School in the Los Feliz side of Hollywood, which his future bandmates Shavo Odadjian and Ontronik &quot;Andy&quot; Khachaturian (System of a Down&#x27;s original drummer) also attended. System of a Down vocalist Serj Tankian attended the school as well, but he was years older than Malakian and the others. Malakian attended Glendale High School as a teenager.

=== System of a Down ===
Malakian met Serj Tankian in 1993, while they both shared the same rehearsal studio in different bands. Tankian was playing the keyboard for a band, and Malakian was playing guitar and singing for another band. They formed a jam band called Soil with bassist Dave Hakopyan and drummer Domingo Laraino. Shavo Odadjian then became their manager, and then rhythm guitarist. Soil broke up and Malakian, Tankian, and Odadjian (who switched to bass) formed a new band using the name &quot;Victims of a Down&quot;, based on a poem that Malakian had written. The word &quot;victims&quot; was changed to &quot;system&quot; because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, Slayer. They then recruited drummer Andy Khachaturian, who was replaced by John Dolmayan in 1997.

Malakian co-produced System of a Down&#x27;s albums with Rick Rubin, as well as albums by the Ambulance and Bad Acid Trip (a band on fellow member Serj Tankian&#x27;s Serjical Strike Records). In 2003, Malakian started his own label, EatUrMusic, on which Amen was the first signed band. The label is now inactive and its current status is unknown.

=== Scars on Broadway ===

In 2003, Malakian (lead guitar and vocals), Greg Kelso (rhythm guitar), Casey Chaos (vocals), and Zach Hill (drums) recorded a demo tape entitled &quot;Ghetto Blaster Rehearsals&quot;, credited to the name Scars on Broadway. However, in 2007, an official letter appeared on the band&#x27;s website that stated that these tracks are not in any way affiliated with Malakian&#x27;s later project Scars on Broadway. Incidentally, these demo sessions produced &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot;, which would be a major hit for System of a Down in 2005.

Following System&#x27;s hiatus, Malakian announced his latest project – Scars on Broadway – a band which would include System of a Down bassist, Shavo Odadjian, and himself. Ultimately, Odadjian was not involved with the band, and instead System of a Down drummer, John Dolmayan became a member. After Malakian and Dolmayan experimented with different musicians (for a period of nine months in 2007–2008) the band took form and forged its sound in intense rehearsals and recording sessions (under Malakian&#x27;s direction at his home studio and Sunset Sound) with musicians Danny Shamoun on keyboards, Dominic Cifarelli on bass, and Franky Perez on guitar and backing vocals for live performances (in the studio Malakian played nearly all the instruments with the exception of drums which were played by Dolmayan and some overdubs provided by the other members). The group released an eponymous album in 2008, which featured the hit single &quot;They Say&quot; (written by Malakian). However, shortly before the tour supporting the album, Malakian canceled all scheduled concert and TV appearances, blaming a lack of enthusiasm and that his &quot;heart wasn&#x27;t into touring.&quot; This sudden cancellation prompted speculation and rumors that the band had broken up. It was the last that would be heard of Malakian for more than a year.

Malakian stayed out of the public eye following his cancellation of the tour in support of Scars on Broadway&#x27;s debut album in October 2008. In 2009 Malakian made a surprise appearance (his first in a year) at Shavo Odadjian&#x27;s Halloween Party and played &quot;Suite-Pee&quot;, &quot;They Say&quot;, and an unknown song with Odadjian, Dolmayan and Scars on Broadway&#x27;s Franky Perez on guitar. It was the first time that the band members (minus Tankian, who was working on his second solo album) performed together in more than three years.

In August 2009, Scars on Broadway, minus Malakian, traveled to Iraq for a USO tour across the U.S. army bases. Their setlist consisted of covers as well as a few Scars songs. Guitarist/vocalist Franky Perez stated on his Twitter that &quot;the Scars tunes sound amazing but they&#x27;re not the same without D...&quot; He also stated before they left that Malakian had given them his blessing. In 2009 Franky Perez mentioned on his Twitter that he and the D-Man (Malakian) were going into the studio to jam, this was the first news people have heard about Malakian&#x27;s whereabouts for about a year.

On November 20, 2009, Malakian played at the Chi Cheng Benefit concert along with Deftones, and also performed with Odadjian and Dolmayan. Malakian, Odadjian, and Dolmayan played &quot;Aerials&quot; and &quot;Toxicity&quot;. He appeared on Cypress Hill&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Rise Up,&quot; on one song, &quot;Trouble Seeker&quot;, which he also produced.

On May 2, 2010, Malakian reunited with Scars on Broadway at the Troubadour in West Hollywood. It was the first time he had performed with the band since October 2008. The group played songs from their album as well as new songs. Odadjian performed with the band for two songs, playing guitar. On August 20, 2010, Malakian played in Hollywood with Scars on Broadway. On November 29, 2010, it was announced that System of a Down would reunite for a European tour to take place in June 2011. They played at the Download Festival on June 11, 2011. Despite playing a number of reunion shows, the band had no plans to record new material. In October 2011, John Dolmayan expressed his interest in writing new material but stated that band members were all busy with their other projects (such as Malakian&#x27;s Scars on Broadway and Serj Tankian&#x27;s solo efforts).

On July 29, 2010, Scars on Broadway released their first new studio recording in exactly two years, a Malakian-penned song called &quot;Fucking&quot;. On February 24, 2012, System of a Down announced that the Scars on Broadway website was back online featuring a preview of a new song called &quot;Guns Are Loaded&quot;.

In 2014, he appeared on Linkin Park&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, for which he provided additional guitars for the promotional single &quot;Rebellion&quot;. The promotional single was self-produced by Mike Shinoda and Brad Delson. On August 18, 2016, Malakian performed with the Los Angeles–based alternative music project Millennials.

On October 28, 2017, Malakian performed with the surviving members of Linkin Park which played a show at the Hollywood Bowl dedicated to the passing of their frontman Chester Bennington. He performed &quot;Rebellion&quot; alongside SOAD bassist Shavo Odadjian.

On April 23, 2018, Malakian released a song with Scars on Broadway called &quot;Lives&quot; about the history and culture of Armenia.
On July 20, 2018, Malakian and Scars on Broadway released the album &quot;Dictator&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Malakian is not married and has no children. In a 2019 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; interview, it was revealed that he is dating Gayané Khechoomian.

A devoted sports enthusiast, he has been lifelong fan of the Edmonton Oilers and the Los Angeles Kings. He has a large collection of Oilers-related memorabilia and has held Kings season tickets since 1999. Malakian has been described as a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

<text>The Association of Free Lutheran Congregations (AFLC) is the sixth largest Lutheran church body in the United States. The AFLC includes congregations from the former Lutheran Free Church in 27 different U.S. states and four Canadian provinces. The AFLC is not an incorporated synod, but a free association. Each local congregation is a separate corporation. Minnesota is the geographic center of the organization, with over 80 congregations and over 12,000 members. There are also numerous congregations in the neighboring states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The AFLC headquarters are in Plymouth, Minnesota, where the Association Free Lutheran Bible School and Seminary are also located.

The beliefs of the AFLC are grounded in Pietist Lutheran tradition. The AFLC logo consists of an open Bible, ascending dove, and green vine. The open Bible is symbolic of God&#x27;s word as the foundation of faith and life; the ascending dove is symbolic of the freedom of congregation and the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit; and the green vine is symbolic of the living congregation bearing fruit for God.

==History==
The AFLC was formed in 1962 by 40 congregations of the former Lutheran Free Church that did not want to join the 1963 merger into The American Lutheran Church (ALC). The ALC had been formed in 1960 by the merger of several ethnic Lutheran denominations. The AFLC was originally called the Lutheran Free Church-not merged, but the ALC filed suit against the group for using the name Lutheran Free Church. The name Association of Free Lutheran Congregations was chosen by 1964. In 2006, the AFLC had 43,360 baptized members in 267 churches and in 2009, the AFLC had 277 pastors, 280 congregations, and 44,473 members.

==Doctrine==
The AFLC accept and believe in the Holy Bible as the complete written Word of God, preserved by the Holy Spirit for salvation and instruction. The AFLC accepts the ancient ecumenical symbols, namely, the Apostles, the Nicene, and the Athanasian Creeds; Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, and the unaltered Augsburg Confession, as the true expression of the Christian faith and life.

There were five principal reasons for the formation of the AFLC:

*Recognition of the Bible as the inspired and inerrant authority in all matters of faith and life. 
*Recognition that the teaching and preaching of God&#x27;s Word is the main task of the Church, to be conducted in such a way that the saints are built up and unbelievers see their need for salvation.
*Belief that the congregation is the right form of the Kingdom of God on earth, with no authority above it but the Word and the Spirit of God;
*Belief that Christian unity is a spiritual concept, not a man-made organization such as the World Council of Churches or the National Council of Churches. 
*Belief that Christians are called to be a salt and light, separated from the ways of the world, and that this difference is to be reflected in the life of the congregation as well as in the institutions of the church body.

Unlike most other conservative Lutheran bodies in the United States, the AFLC allows open communion and women&#x27;s suffrage in congregational voting.

==Committees and corporations==
The AFLC has five corporations that are sponsored by the AFLC to direct their common endeavors: the Coordinating Committee, the Schools Corporation, the Missions Corporation, the AFLC Foundation, and the Association Retreat Center (ARC. There are two auxiliary corporations in the AFLC: the Women&#x27;s Missionary Federation (WMF) and Free Lutheran Youth (FLY).

===Coordinating Committee===

The coordinating committee consists of seven members from the congregations currently part of the AFLC. The main duties of the coordinating committee includes monitoring the pastoral roster, monitoring the congregational roster, and providing guidance for the other ministries of the AFLC, including youth, evangelism, parish education, etc.

===Schools Corporation===

The schools corporation&#x27;s main delegation is the election of the board of trustees, that governs the Free Lutheran Bible College and Seminary (FLBCS). This corporation consists of fifty members from the congregations of the AFLC. The AFLC leaders decided to create a Lutheran Bible School patterned after the fundamental teachings of the Lutheran Bible Institute founded in 1919. The school was opened in 1966 with 13 students but grew to 35 the next year. By the 1990s, the school, renamed to Association Free Lutheran Bible School, was averaging 105 students. Today there are approximately 100 students attending the school.

===Missions Corporation===

The missions corporation consists of one hundred members of the congregations of the AFLC and elects from itself a Home Missions Committee and a World Missions Committee which are involved in the outreach of the AFLC into the United States and several other countries.

===AFLC Foundation===

===Association Retreat Center===
The Association Retreat Center (ARC) is a separate organization of the AFLC located near Osceola, Wisconsin, that serves as a retreat center for various activities within the AFLC.

===Other committees and corporations===
The Women&#x27;s Missionary Federation (WMF) serves the women of the churches with Bible studies, fellowship, and has an emphasis on missionary services.

The Free Lutheran Youth (FLY) is a youth organization dealing with youth ministry.

==Publications==
The official publication of the AFLC is &quot;The Lutheran Ambassador&quot;, with twelve issues per year devoted to Bible-centered articles and news of the churches. Ambassador Publications is the parish education department of the AFLC.

The &quot;Ambassador Hymnal&quot; is the hymnal published by the AFLC. It contains over 600 hymns as well as a selected order of church services and responsive Bible readings.

==Presidents==

* John P. Strand (1962–1978)
* Richard Snipstead (1978–1992)
* Robert L. Lee (1992–2007)
* Elden K. Nelson (2007–2013)
* Lyndon Korhonen (2013–2022)
* Micah Hjermstad (2022-Present)

==Annual conferences==
The AFLC schedules an annual conference to share reports of congregations and other various ministries. The main reason for these conferences is spiritual edification, as the schedules include prayer times, worship hours, and business meetings together. At the conference, suggestions for changes are presented and discussed and the elections for positions in committees/corporations are conducted.

<text>Jazz Standard was a jazz club located at 116 East 27th Street in the Rose Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It frequently hosted well-known bands and musicians. The club was owned by restaurateur Danny Meyer and was located in the basement of one of his Blue Smoke restaurants.

The Mingus Big Band, the Mingus Orchestra, and Mingus Dynasty rotated every Monday night as the club&#x27;s de facto house bands. The former won the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album for their album Live at Jazz Standard. The Maria Schneider Orchestra played a week-long gig at the club every Thanksgiving from 2005 to 2019.

The magazine &quot;New York&quot; listed the club as a ″top 5 jazz joint″. &quot;The New York City Jazz Record&quot; named Jazz Standard the &quot;venue of the year&quot; 2017.

On December 2, 2020, the Jazz Standard announced it would be closing its doors at 116 East 27th Street permanently, due to lack of revenue from COVID-19 and stalled rent negotiations.

== History ==

When the club opened in the fall of 1997 the upstairs restaurant was called &quot;Standard&quot;.

<text>The University of Saskatchewan (U of S, or USask) is a Canadian public research university, founded on March 19, 1907, and located on the east side of the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. An &quot;Act to establish and incorporate a University for the Province of Saskatchewan&quot; was passed by the provincial legislature in 1907. It established the provincial university on March 19, 1907 &quot;for the purpose of providing facilities for higher education in all its branches and enabling all persons without regard to race, creed or religion to take the fullest advantage&quot;. The University of Saskatchewan is the largest education institution in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The University of Saskatchewan is one of Canada&#x27;s top research universities (based on the number of Canada Research Chairs) and is a member of the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities (the 15 most research-intensive universities in Canada).

The university began as an agricultural college in 1907 and established the first Canadian university-based department of extension in 1910. There were set aside for university buildings and for the U of S farm, and agricultural fields. In total was annexed for the university. The main university campus is situated upon , with another allocated for Innovation Place Research Park. The University of Saskatchewan agriculture college still has access to neighbouring urban research lands. The University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) facility, (2003) develops DNA-enhanced immunization vaccines for both humans and animals.
The university is also home to the Canadian Light Source synchrotron, which is considered one of the largest and most innovative investments in Canadian science. Discoveries made at the U of S include sulphate-resistant cement and the cobalt-60 cancer therapy unit. The university offers over 200 academic programs.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The University of Saskatchewan was modeled on the American state university system, with a focus on extension work and applied research to serve the needs of the largely agrarian province. The university was granted a provincial charter through the &quot;University Act&quot;, which was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan on March 19, 1907. This act established the university as a publicly funded but independent institution, intended to serve the citizens of the province.

The governance model was based on the University of Toronto Act, 1906, creating a bicameral system that included a senate to manage academic matters and a board of governors to oversee finances. The president was responsible for linking the two governing bodies and providing institutional leadership.

On April 7, 1909, Saskatoon was chosen as the location for the university. The first buildings were constructed shortly after, and the university admitted its first students in 1912. In the same year, the university awarded its first degrees. The emphasis on agriculture and practical education reflected the province&#x27;s needs, and the establishment of the College of Agriculture became a cornerstone of the university&#x27;s mission.

The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. The scope of the new institution was to include colleges of arts and science, including art, music and commerce, agriculture with forestry, domestic science, education, engineering, law, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary science and dentistry.

Saskatoon was chosen as the site for the university on April 7, 1909, by the board of governors. On October 12, 1912, the first building opened its doors for student admission. It awarded its first degrees in 1912. Duncan P. McColl was appointed as the first registrar, establishing the first convocation from which Chief Justice Edward L. Wetmore was elected as the first chancellor. Walter Charles Murray became the first president of the university&#x27;s board of governors. In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.

Battleford, Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, Regina, and Saskatoon all lobbied to be the location of the new university. Walter Murray preferred the provincial capital, Regina. In a politically influenced vote, Saskatoon was chosen on April 7, 1909.
Designed by David Robertson Brown (architect), the Memorial Gates were erected in 1927 at the corner of College Drive and Hospital Drive in honour of the University of Saskatchewan alumni who served in the First World War. A stone wall bears inscriptions of the names of the sixty seven university students and faculty who lost their lives while on service during World War I. The hallways of the Old Administrative Building (College Building) at the University of Saskatchewan are decorated with memorial scrolls in honour of the University of Saskatchewan alumni who served in the World Wars.

342 students, faculty, and staff enlisted for World War I. Of these, 67 were killed, 100 were wounded, and 33 were awarded medals of valour.

The University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s Arms were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on February 15, 2001.

In May 2014, Provost and Academic Vice President Brett Fairbairn resigned following turmoil after the university fired the executive director of the School of Public Health, following his public criticism of a process to address the university&#x27;s structural deficit. President Ilene Busch-Vishniac refused to resign. Two days later she was fired.
===Campus===

A location next to the South Saskatchewan River, across from the city centre of Saskatoon, was selected for the campus. David Robertson Brown of Brown &amp; Vallance were the initial architects constructing a campus plan and the first university buildings in Collegiate Gothic style: The Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, laid the cornerstone of the first building, the College Building, on July 29, 1910. The first building to be started on the new campus, the College Building, built 1910–1912 opened in 1913; in 2001, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada.

Brown &amp; Vallance designed the Administration Building (1910–12); Saskatchewan Hall Student Residence (1910–12). Brown &amp; Vallance designed the Engineering Building (1910–12) as well as additions 1913 in 1920 and rebuilt the building after it burned in 1925. Brown &amp; Vallance designed the Barn and Stock Pavilion (1910–12) and Emmanuel College (1910–12). Brown &amp; Vallance built the Faculty Club (1911–12) and rebuilt it after it burned in 1964. Brown &amp; Vallance constructed the President&#x27;s Residence (1911–13) Qu&#x27;Appelle Hall Student Residence (1914–16) Physics Building (1919–21); Chemistry Building (1922–23); St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian College (1922–23); Memorial Gates (1927–28) and the Field Husbandry Building (1929).

The original buildings were built using native limestone – greystone – which was mined just north of campus. Over the years, this greystone became one of the most recognizable campus signatures. When the local supply of limestone was exhausted, the university turned to Tyndall stone, which is quarried in Manitoba. Saskatchewan&#x27;s Provincial University and Agricultural College were officially opened May 1, 1913 by Hon. Walter Scott.
The original architectural plan called for the university buildings to be constructed around a green space known as &quot;The Bowl&quot;. The original university buildings are now connected by skywalks and tunnels. Clockwise, from the north; Thorvaldson Building (August 22, 1924) (Spinks addition); Geology, W.P. Thompson Biology (1960) adjoined to Physics Building (1921); College Building (May 1, 1913) (Administration addition); Saskatchewan conjoined with Athabasca Hall (1964); Qu&#x27;Appelle Hall (1916); Marquis Hall adjoined to Place Riel – Qu&#x27;Appelle Addition; Murray Memorial Main Library (1956); Arts (1960) conjoined with Law and adjoined to Commerce building complete the initial circle around the perimeter of the bowl.

Francis Henry Portnall and Frank Martin designed the Dairy &amp; Soils Laboratory (1947).

===Establishment of colleges===
Roughly adhering to the original plan of 1909, numerous colleges were established: Arts &amp; Science (1909); Agriculture, now called Agriculture and Bioresources (1912); Engineering (1912); Law (1913); Pharmacy, now called Pharmacy &amp; Nutrition (1914); Commerce, now the N. Murray Edwards School of Business (1917); Medicine (1926); Education (1927); Home Economics (1928); Nursing (1938); Graduate Studies and Research (1946); Physical Education, now called Kinesiology (1958); Veterinary Medicine (1964); Dentistry (1965); and the School of Physical Therapy (1976).

The U of S also has several graduate programs amongst these colleges, which give rise to a master&#x27;s or doctorate degree. In 1966, the University of Saskatchewan introduced a master&#x27;s program in adult education. Diploma, and certificate post secondary courses are also available to aid in professional development.
Theological colleges, affiliated with the university, were also established: Emmanuel College – (Anglican denomination) (1909), St. Andrew&#x27;s College (as &quot;Presbyterian College, Saskatoon&quot;) then United Church of Canada (1913), Lutheran Theological Seminary (1920), St. Thomas More College (1936), and Central Pentecostal College (1983).

Regina College was saved from bankruptcy and became part of the university in 1934, and was given degree-granting privileges in 1959, making it a second University of Saskatchewan campus. By another act of legislation in 1974, Regina College was made an independent institution known as the University of Regina.

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities.

Correspondence courses were established in 1929.

Other federated and affiliated colleges include Briercrest Bible College and Biblical Seminary in Caronport, Saskatchewan; Gabriel Dumont College and St. Peter&#x27;s Historic Junior College in Muenster, Saskatchewan.

===Later development===
In the late 1990s, the U of S launched a major revitalisation program, comprising new capital projects such as an expansion to the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, the building of a new parkade, and a revision of its internal road layout (which has already seen the East Road access being realigned). The Thorvaldson Building, which is home to the departments of chemistry and computer science, hosts a new expansion known as the Spinks addition. The College of Pharmacy and Nutrition has also had a number of renovations.

===Land holdings===
Up until the late 1980s, the University of Saskatchewan held an extensive area of land in the northeast quadrant of Saskatoon, stretching far beyond the core campus, east of Preston Avenue and north of the Sutherland and Forest Grove subdivisions. Much of this land was used for farming, though some areas were intended for future campus and facility development. In the late 1980s, most U of S land beyond Circle Drive was earmarked for residential development; Silverspring was the first of these neighbourhoods to be developed.
Another section of land, west of the Preston Avenue/Circle Drive interchange and north of the Canadian Pacific Railway line, was zoned for commercial use, and led to &quot;big box&quot; retail development in the early 2000s called Preston Crossing. Realignment of two major roads in the area around this same time (Preston Avenue and 108th Street) also used up a portion of university land. The U of S obtained a large tract of land immediately east of the Saskatoon city limits after the city annexed the northeastern section of U of S land (this land has since been itself annexed into the city). The U of S leased a site to the Correctional Service of Canada north of Attridge Drive on Central Avenue for the Regional Psychiatric Centre. It has an additional undeveloped parcel of land at Central Avenue and Fedoruk Road.

In the 1970s and again in the 1980s, the U of S considered opening up some of its land holdings south of College Drive and north of 14th Street for residential development, but opposition from nearby neighbourhoods that appreciated the &quot;green belt&quot; offered by the university led to these plans being dropped. The city has refrained from indicating any residential development plans for the newer land holdings in the northeast, allowing another green belt to be created separating the new communities of Evergreen and Aspen Ridge from other parts of the city.

The City of Saskatoon&#x27;s Fire Station No. 5 was relocated to the university&#x27;s land on Preston Avenue North in 2023. It replaced the former station on Central Avenue in the Sutherland neighbourhood, which dated back to 1967.

==Academics==
===Rankings and reputation===

The University of Saskatchewan has placed in post-secondary school rankings. In the 2023 &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; rankings, the university ranked 301–400 in the world and 12–17 in Canada. The 2025 &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; ranked the university 340th in the world and 14th in Canada. The 2024 &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; placed the university 351–400 in the world, and 16th in Canada. In &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2022–23 global university rankings, the university placed 441st, and 18th in Canada. In &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; 2024 rankings, Saskatchewan placed 15th in their Medical-Doctoral university category, and 21st in their reputation ranking for Canadian universities.

In February 2025, the University of Saskatchewan was identified as one of Saskatchewan&#x27;s top 100 employers, based on employees having &#x27;free access to the campus&#x27; extensive fitness facilities&#x27; and 21-week / 95% of salary maternity and parental leave benefits for &#x27;all new parents&#x27;.

===Programs===
The University of Saskatchewan offers a wide variety of programs and courses. Agriculture and Bioresources, Arts and Science, Biotechnology, Edwards School of Business, Dentistry, Education, Engineering, Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, Kinesiology, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Nutrition, Physical Therapy and Veterinary Medicine.

In addition, the university&#x27;s affiliated colleges and Centre for Continuing and Distance Education offer degree programs, certificates, and training programs. Many affiliated colleges allow students to complete the first two years of a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree, and some offer full degrees in education, native studies, and theology.

===Research===
In 1948, the university built the first betatron facility in Canada. Three years later, the world&#x27;s first non-commercial cobalt-60 therapy unit was constructed. (The first female chancellor of the university, Sylvia Fedoruk, was a member of the cobalt-60 research team. She also served as Saskatchewan&#x27;s lieutenant-governor from 1988 to 1994.) The success of these facilities led to the construction of a linear accelerator as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory in 1964 and placed university scientists at the forefront of nuclear physics in Canada. The Plasma Physics Laboratory operates a tokamak on campus. The university used the SCR-270 radar in 1949 to image the Aurora for the first time.

Experience gained from years of research and collaboration with global researchers led to the University of Saskatchewan being selected as the site of Canada&#x27;s national facility for synchrotron light research, the Canadian Light Source. This facility opened October 22, 2004 and is the size of a football field.

The university also is home to the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. Innovation Place Research Park is an industrial science and technology park that hosts private industry working with the university.

The &quot;University Act&quot; provided that the university should provide &quot;facilities for higher education in all its branches and enabling all persons without regard to race, creed or religion to take the fullest advantage&quot;. It further stated that &quot;no woman shall by reason of her sex be deprived of any advantage or privilege accorded to the male students of the university.&quot; Seventy students began the first classes on September 28, 1909. The first class graduated on May 1, 1912. Of the three students who earned graduation honours, two were women.
The University of Saskatchewan has a tricameral governance structure, defined by the University of Saskatchewan Act, consisting of a Board of Governors, University Council, and Senate, as well as the General Academic Assembly. Financial, management, as well as administration affairs are handled by the Board of Governors, which comprises 11 members. The University of Saskatchewan liaison between the public and professional sector is dealt with by the university Senate, a body of 100 representatives. Finally, University Council is made up of a combination of 116 faculty and students. Council is the university&#x27;s academic governing body, responsible for &quot;overseeing and directing the University&#x27;s academic affairs.&quot; The General Academic Assembly consists of all faculty members and elected students. As of 2006, faculty and staff total 7,000, and student enrolment comprised 15,005 full-time students as well as 3,552 part-time students.

The university senior administration consists of the President and Vice-Chancellor Professor, Peter Stoicheff; the Provost and Vice-president Academic, Professor Arini; Vice-president (Finance &amp; Resources), Greg Fowler; Vice-president (Research), Professor Baljit Singh; and the vice-president (University Relations) Debra Pozega Osburn.

==Campus life and facilities==
&quot;The Sheaf&quot;, a student publication, was first published in 1912, monthly or less frequently. By 1920, it was published weekly with the aim of becoming a more unifying influence on student life. It has continued to publish.

In 1965, a student-run campus radio station, CJUS-FM began broadcasting on a non-commercial basis. In 1983, the station became a limited commercial station. By 1985, however, funding was no longer provided, and the campus radio presence died. In early 2005, CJUS was revived in an internet radio form and continues to broadcast today. The university also maintains a relationship with the independent community radio station CFCR-FM, which actively solicits volunteers on campus.

&quot;Place Riel Theatre&quot;, a campus theatre, was opened in 1975, as was &quot;Louis&quot;, a campus pub. &quot;Place Riel&quot;, the existing campus student centre, opened in 1980, and now holds retail outlets, arcade, lounge space, student group meeting areas, and a food court; it is undergoing expansion and renovation, slated for completion in 2012–2013. These facilities were named after Louis Riel. In the late 1990s, Place Riel Theatre stopped public showings and it is now used for campus movie features and lectures.

The University of Saskatchewan Students&#x27; Union is the students&#x27; union representing full-time undergraduate students at the University of Saskatchewan.

Since 1992, the graduate students are represented by the University of Saskatchewan Graduate Student&#x27;s Association (GSA-uSask), a not-for-profit student organization that provides services, events, student clubs and advocacy work to the graduate students of the &quot;U of S&quot;. Since 2007, the GSA-uSask is located in the Emmanuel and St. Chad Chapel, also called GSA Commons.
Campus sports teams in U Sports use the name Saskatchewan Huskies. The U of S Huskies compete in eight men&#x27;s sports: Canadian football, basketball, cross country, hockey, soccer, track and field, volleyball and wrestling and seven women&#x27;s sports: basketball, cross country, hockey, soccer, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. The Huskies Track and Field team has won the national championships on 12 occasions and is the most successful team on campus The men&#x27;s Huskies football team has won the Vanier Cup as national champions on three occasions; in 1990, 1996, and 1998.

The school yard at one time comprised three school houses, as the population grew. The little stone school house was preserved and moved on campus. It was declared a historic site on June 1, 1967.

===School songs===
The University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s fight song &quot;Saskatchewan, Our University&quot;, was written by Russell Hopkins in 1939. Hopkins was notable in the university community at the time, and won a Rhodes Scholarship in 1932. The fight song is commonly played at sporting events.

Also composed for the university is an Alma Mater hymn known as &quot;University Hymn&quot;. Neil Harris wrote the hymn in 1949. The hymn is performed at convocation events.

===Residence life===
* Voyageur Place &#x27;Room and board&#x27; residences on the University of Saskatchewan campus and comprises four separate halls.
** Saskatchewan Hall was the first student residence of the university and was completed in 1912. Originally called University Hall, it was designed to provide residences for 150 students. Saskatchewan Hall was named for the Saskatchewan River.
** Qu&#x27;Appelle Hall was originally known as Student&#x27;s Residence No. 2 and officially opened in 1916. The design housed 120 students, and in 1963 an addition for 60 additional student residences was completed. The Qu&#x27;Appelle Hall Addition is the fourth residence of Voyageur Place and houses male students. Qu&#x27;Appelle Hall was named for the Qu&#x27;Appelle River.
** Athabasca Hall provides 270 residences and was completed in 1964. It is now a co-ed hall. Athabasca Hall was named for the Athabasca River.

Voyageur Place has historically been organized on the house system, with each house named after an explorer associated with Saskatchewan&#x27;s early history. Thus, traditionally there were three male houses: Hearne House (named after Samuel Hearne and consisting of the residents of Saskatchewan Hall); Kelsey (named after Henry Kelsey and consisting of the residents of Qu&#x27;Appelle Hall); and Lav (named after Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye and consisting of the residents of Qu&#x27;Appelle Hall Addition). There were also three female houses (all of which were composed of residents of the all-female Athabasca Hall): Pond (named after Peter Pond), Henday (named after Anthony Henday), and Palliser (named after John Palliser).

* McEown Park – Residence complex south of the university campus. Opening ceremonies were October 2, 1970 for the four high rise complex. McEown Park was named in honour of a university administrator, A.C. McEown.
** Souris Hall is an apartment complex for married students with families. Souris Hall, named after the Souris River, is a nine-storey town house, comprising 67 two-bedroom apartments.
** Assiniboine Hall is an eleven-storey apartment house which has 23 two-bedroom and 84 one-bedroom apartments available for married or single students without families. Assiniboine Hall was named for the Assiniboine River.
** Wollaston Hall was added to McEown Park complex in 1976, providing 21 two-bedroom and 83 one-bedroom apartments.
** Seager Wheeler Hall provides housing for single students living in small groups in a fourteen-storey residential house. Seager Wheeler Hall was named in honour of Seager Wheeler, a notable Saskatchewan pioneer for breeding wheat. This residence was on the original three complexes built at McEown Park.

Graduate House is the university&#x27;s newest residence, which opened in 2013 in the College Quarter.

==Indigenization, Reconciliation and Decolonization==
In 2017, the University of Saskatchewan appointed Dr. Jacqueline Ottmann as the Vice Provost Indigenous Engagement.

The University of Saskatchewan provides services to Indigenous people in more remote communities. The University of Saskatchewan Summer University Transition Course brings first-year Indigenous students to campus before the start of the school year for some campus orientation. Academic counsellors, tutors and elders are present on campus at the University of Saskatchewan to provide academic and social supports.

===Science outreach Kamskénow program===
The Science outreach Kamskénow program, runs out of the College of Arts and Science at the University of Saskatchewan.
PotashCorp Kamskénow is a science outreach program that provides hands-on learning in Saskatoon classrooms based on each of the Division of Science disciplines at the U of S: biology, chemistry, computer science, geological sciences, mathematics and physics. Rather than a one-time school visit, the program offers students 12 weeks of classroom activities culminating in a trip to on-campus labs in week 13. All sessions are led by U of S graduate and undergraduate students.
This program has been chosen as the joint winner of the 2014 Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Award for the North America region. Additional funding for PotashCorp Kamskénow comes from NSERC, the Community Initiatives Fund, the College of Arts &amp; Science and U of S Community Engagement and Outreach.

<doc id="267689" wikidata="Q4909285" url="?curid=267689" title="Bill Hamilton (engineer)">
<text>Sir Charles William Feilden Hamilton (26 July 1899 – 30 March 1978) was a New Zealand engineer who developed the modern jetboat, and founded the water jet manufacturing company, CWF Hamilton Ltd.

Hamilton never claimed to have invented the jet boat. He once said &quot;I do not claim to have invented marine jet propulsion. The honour belongs to a gentleman named Archimedes, who lived some years ago.&quot; What he did was refine the design enough to produce the first useful modern jet boat.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born at Ashwick Station near Fairlie, New Zealand.

Hamilton survived an airplane accident returning to Rongotai Airport (Wellington) in poor conditions on 19 February 1936. The collision with the anemometer mast took the starboard wing off the fastest &#x27;plane in the country, the Miles Falcon Six he was travelling in, and pilot Malcolm &quot;Mac&quot; McGregor died in hospital.

At the age of 21 he bought the &#x27;Irishman Creek&#x27; sheep station in South Canterbury. After a trip to England became fascinated with motor cars and raced a Bentley. He decided to develop his own heavy machinery. He built a workshop, developed an excavator with an earth scoop and built a dam to supply water for a hydroelectric plant to supply power for domestic use and for his engineering projects, and started a manufacturing business.

==Ski tows==
In 1947 tourism pioneer Harry Wigley of Mount Cook airline fame commissioned him to design and build the first tow for the Coronet Peak Ski Field near Queenstown New Zealand&#x27;s first commercial skifield. In 1949 he completed a similar tow at Mount Ruapehu. Within a few years he had perfected the &quot;Hamilton Model B&quot; design that is still in use for nutcracker ski tows in New Zealand and Australia.

==Christchurch==
The main manufacturing business, which had started in the workshop at Irishman Creek in 1939, moved to Christchurch in 1948. From there the company supplied heavy machinery, in particular to the Waitaki River hydroelectric projects.

==Jet boats==

In the 1950s Hamilton set out to try to build a boat that could navigate the shallow fast flowing rivers where he lived. The rivers were too shallow for propeller driven boats to navigate as the propeller would hit the river bottom.

He investigated the American Hanley Hydro-Jet, a model which drew in water and fired it out through a steerable nozzle underneath the boat. Even when further adapted it did not work well. An employee suggested moving the nozzle to just above the waterline.

When he took one of his early demonstration jet boats to the United States, the media scoffed when he said he planned to take it up the Colorado River, but in 1960 three Hamilton jet boats, the Kiwi, Wee Red and Dock, became the first and only boats to travel up through the Grand Canyon. The boats also went down river through the Grand Canyon to cache petrol just prior to the uprun. The Grand Canyon trip planning, logistics for 2,500 gallons of fuel, and fuel placement was coordinated by famous Grand Canyon river runner Otis &quot;Dock&quot; Marston.

==CWF Hamilton &amp; Co Ltd==
The engineering company Hamilton founded, CWF Hamilton &amp; Co Ltd, is now the holding company for two companies, Hamilton Jet and Hamilton Marine, that are focused on the production of waterjet propulsion systems. The company has divested itself of its other engineering activities.

==Honours and awards==
In the 1961 New Year Honours, Hamilton was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to engineering. In the 1974 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for services to manufacturing.

In 2004, Hamilton was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

<doc id="267693" wikidata="Q1058775" url="?curid=267693" title="Flushing, Queens">
<text>Flushing is a neighborhood in the north-central portion of the New York City borough of Queens. The neighborhood is the fourth-largest central business district in New York City. Downtown Flushing is a major commercial and retail area, and the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue at its core is the third-busiest in New York City, behind Times Square and Herald Square.

Flushing was established as a settlement of New Netherland on October 10, 1645, on the eastern bank of Flushing Creek. It was named Vlissingen, after the Dutch city of Vlissingen. The English took control of New Amsterdam in 1664, and when Queens County was established in 1683, the Town of Flushing was one of the original five towns of Queens. In 1898, Flushing was consolidated into the City of Greater New York. Development came in the early 20th century with the construction of bridges and public transportation. An immigrant population, composed mostly of Chinese, Indians, and Koreans, settled in Flushing in the late 20th century.

Flushing contains numerous residential subsections, and its diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside there. Flushing is served by several stations on the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Washington Branch, as well as the New York City Subway&#x27;s IRT Flushing Line (), which has its terminus at Main Street.

Flushing is located in Queens Community District 7, and its ZIP Codes are 11354, 11355, and 11358. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 109th Precinct.

== History ==
=== Precolonial and colonial history ===

Flushing was originally inhabited by the Lenape Indians prior to colonization and European settlement.

==== Dutch colony ====

On October 10, 1645, Flushing was established on the eastern bank of Flushing Creek under charter of the Dutch West India Company and was part of the New Netherland colony that was governed from New Amsterdam (Lower Manhattan). The settlement was named Vlissingen, after the city of Vlissingen, which was the European base of the Dutch West India company. By 1657, the residents called the place &quot;Vlishing&quot;. Eventually, the formal traditional English name for the Dutch town, &quot;Flushing&quot;, would be settled upon (despite being a Dutch colony, many of the local early settlers were British, who trickled down from nearby Connecticut colony).

Unlike all other towns in the region, the charter of Flushing allowed residents freedom of religion as practiced in Holland &quot;without the disturbance of any magistrate or ecclesiastical minister&quot;. However, in 1656, New Amsterdam Director-General Peter Stuyvesant issued an edict prohibiting the harboring of Quakers. On December 27, 1657, the inhabitants of Flushing approved a protest known as The Flushing Remonstrance. This petition contained religious arguments even mentioning freedom for &quot;Jews, Turks, and Egyptians,&quot; but ended with a forceful declaration that any infringement of the town charter would not be tolerated. Subsequently, a farmer named John Bowne held Quaker meetings in his home and was arrested for this and deported to Holland. Eventually he persuaded the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the New World.
Landmarks remaining from the Dutch period in Flushing include the John Bowne House (c. 1661) on Bowne Street and the Old Quaker Meeting House (1694) on Northern Boulevard. The Remonstrance was signed at a house on the site of the former State Armory, now a police facility, on the south side Northern Boulevard between Linden Place and Union Street.

==== English colony ====
In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the New Netherland colony, and renamed it the Province of New York. When Queens County was established in 1683, the &quot;Town of Flushing&quot; was one of the original five towns which comprised the county. Many historical references to Flushing are to this town, bounded from Newtown on the west by Flushing Creek (now Flushing River), from Jamaica on the south by the watershed, and from Hempstead on the east by what later became the Nassau County line. The town was dissolved in 1898 when Queens became a borough of New York City, and the term &quot;Flushing&quot; today usually refers to a much smaller area, for example the former Village of Flushing.
Flushing was a seat of power as the Province of New York up to the American Revolution was led by Governor Cadwallader Colden, based at his Spring Hill estate.

Flushing was the site of the first commercial tree nurseries in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. A tract of Parsons&#x27;s exotic specimens was preserved on the north side of Kissena Park. The nurseries are also commemorated in the names of west–east avenues that intersect Kissena Boulevard; the streets are named after plants and ordered alphabetically from Ash Avenue in the north to Rose Avenue in the south. Flushing also supplied trees to the &quot;Greensward Project&quot;, now known as Central Park in Manhattan. Well into the 20th century, Flushing contained many horticultural establishments and greenhouses.

During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops, though one battalion of Scottish Highlanders is known to have been stationed at Flushing during the war. Following the Battle of Long Island, Zackary Perrine, an officer in the Continental Army, was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.
The 1785 Kingsland Homestead, originally the residence of a wealthy Quaker merchant, now serves as the home of the Queens Historical Society.

=== 19th century ===
During the 19th century, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic vitality, so did Flushing. Its proximity to Manhattan was critical in its transformation into a fashionable residential area. On April 15, 1837, the Village of Flushing was incorporated within the Town of Flushing. The official seal was merely the words, &quot;Village of Flushing&quot;, surrounded by nondescript flowers. No other emblem or flag is known to have been used. The Village of Flushing included the neighbourhoods of Flushing Highlands, Bowne Park, Murray Hill, Ingleside, and Flushing Park.

The Flushing and North Side Railroad opened its Port Washington Branch to Flushing in 1854, providing access to Hunters Point on the East River shore. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. The Village of College Point was incorporated in 1867, and the Village of Whitestone was incorporated in 1868. The first free public high school in what is now New York City was established in Flushing in 1875. Flushing, then a small village, established a library in 1858, the oldest in Queens County and only slightly younger than the library of the City of Brooklyn (built in 1852).

In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, the Town of Flushing (along with two other towns and other land of Queens County) was consolidated into the City of New York to form the new Borough of Queens. All towns, villages, and cities within the new borough were dissolved.

Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City. A major factor in this was the Halleran real estate agency. From the American Civil War to the end of the 1930s its slogan &quot;Ask Mr. Halleran!&quot; could be seen in ads all over Long Island, and the phrase from its maps &quot;So This Is Flushing&quot; became a catchphrase.

=== 20th-century development ===
The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the Queensboro Bridge over the East River opened, connecting Queens County to midtown Manhattan. With the opening of Pennsylvania Station the next year, the Port Washington Branch, now part of the Long Island Rail Road, started running to midtown Manhattan. Broadway, a main roadway through Flushing, was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard. The Roosevelt Avenue Bridge over the Flushing River, which carries four lanes of traffic and the New York City Subway&#x27;s elevated Flushing Line (), was the largest trunnion bascule bridge in the world when it was completed in 1927. The next year, the Main Street terminal of the Flushing subway line opened in downtown Flushing, giving the neighborhood direct subway access.

Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the U.S. East Coast and Chicago. Decades later, the RKO Keith&#x27;s movie palace would host vaudeville acts and appearances by the likes of Mickey Rooney, the Marx Brothers and Bob Hope.

==== Asian communities ====
In the 1970s, immigrants from Taiwan established a foothold in Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white, interspersed with a small Japanese community. Additionally, a large South Korean population also called Flushing home. The Taiwanese immigrants were the first wave of Chinese-speaking immigrants who spoke Mandarin (Taiwanese also spoken) rather than Cantonese to arrive in New York City. Many Taiwanese immigrants were additionally Hokkien and had relatives or connections to Fujian province in China, which led to large influxes of Fuzhounese Americans.

Over the years, many new non-Cantonese ethnic Chinese immigrants from different regions and provinces of China started to arrive in New York City and settled in Flushing through word of mouth. This wave of immigrants spoke Mandarin and various regional/provincial dialects. The early 1990s and 2000s brought a wave of Fuzhounese Americans and Wenzhounese immigrants, who mostly spoke Mandarin, and who settled in Flushing as well as Elmhurst. Flushing&#x27;s Chinese population became diverse over the next few decades as people from different provinces started to arrive. Due to loosened emigration restrictions in mainland China, there has been a growing Northern Chinese population in Flushing. The regional food cuisines have led to Flushing being considered the &quot;food mecca&quot; for Chinese regional cuisine outside of Asia.

=== 21st-century transformation ===

In the 21st century, Flushing has cemented its status as an international &quot;melting pot&quot;, predominantly attracting immigrants from Asia, particularly from throughout the various provinces of China, but including newcomers from all over the world. Flushing Chinatown is centered around Main Street and the area to its west, most prominently along Roosevelt Avenue, which have become the primary nexus of Flushing Chinatown. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. The Flushing Chinatown houses over 30,000 individuals born in China alone, the largest Chinatown by this metric outside Asia and one of the largest and fastest-growing Chinatowns in the world. In January 2019, the &quot;New York Post&quot; named Flushing as New York City&#x27;s &quot;most dynamic outer-borough neighborhood&quot;. Flushing is undergoing rapid gentrification by Chinese transnational entities.

This is longer than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged and elderly: 22% are between the ages of between 25 and 44, 30% between 45 and 64, and 18% over 65. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 17% and 7%, respectively.

== Cultural enclaves ==

=== Diverse Chinese communities ===
Flushing Chinatown, or Mandarin Town is the world&#x27;s largest and one of the fastest-growing Chinatowns, known as the &quot;Chinese Times Square&quot; or the &quot;Chinese Manhattan&quot;. In Mandarin, Flushing is known as &quot;Falasheng&quot; (). The Chinatown of Flushing is centered around the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, and many of the area&#x27;s Chinese businesses are located on the blocks around, or west of, Main Street. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard.

In the 1970s, a Chinese community established a foothold in the neighborhood of Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white. Taiwanese began the surge of immigration, followed by other groups of Chinese. A 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone. By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population. However, ethnic Chinese are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. High rates of both legal and illegal immigration from Mainland China continue to spur the ongoing rise of the ethnic Chinese population in Flushing. According to a &quot;Daily News&quot; article in 2011, Flushing&#x27;s Chinatown ranked as New York City&#x27;s second largest Chinese community with 33,526 Chinese, surpassed only by the Brooklyn Chinatown (布鲁克林華埠), and larger than Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown. The growth of the business activity at the core of Downtown Flushing, dominated by the Flushing Chinatown, has continued to flourish despite the Covid-19 pandemic.Flushing now rivals Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown as a center of Chinese culture. The Lunar New Year Parade has become a growing annual celebration of Chinese New Year. In addition, several Chinese supermarkets such as Hong Kong Supermarket and New York Supermarket have locations in Flushing. The &quot;World Journal&quot;, one of the largest Chinese-language newspapers outside China, is headquartered in adjacent Whitestone. Numerous other Chinese- and English-language publications are available in Flushing, including SinoVision, one of North America&#x27;s largest Chinese language television networks.

The popular styles of Chinese cuisine are ubiquitously accessible in Flushing, including Hakka, Taiwanese, Shanghainese, Hunanese, Sichuanese, Cantonese, Fujianese, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, and Korean Chinese cuisine. Even the relatively obscure Dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to Northeast China is now available in Flushing, as well as Mongolian cuisine and Uyghur cuisine. Varieties of Chinese spoken in Flushing include Mandarin Chinese, Fuzhou dialect, Min Nan (Hokkien), Wu Chinese (Wenzhounese, Shanghainese, Suzhou dialect, Hangzhou dialect), and Cantonese; in addition, the Mongolian language is now emerging. Given its rapidly growing status, the Flushing Chinatown has surpassed in size and population the original New York City Chinatown in the borough of Manhattan and this substantial growth has resulted in a commensurate rise in this Chinatown&#x27;s cultural status.

In accompaniment with its rapid growth, Flushing in particular has witnessed the proliferation of highly competitive businesses touted as educational centers as well as non-profit organizations declaring the intent to educate the community. Some entities offer education in Mandarin, the most spoken Chinese variety in mainland China. A diverse array of social services geared toward assisting recent as well as established Chinese immigrants is readily available in Flushing. As of the 2020s, about 3/4 of the Asian population in the area are of Chinese descent making them the majority of the Asian population.

=== Korean community ===

There is a Koreatown that originated in Flushing, but has since spread eastward to Murray Hill, Bayside, Douglaston, and Little Neck in Queens, and also into Nassau County. The Koreatown has historically been centered around Union Street, with the later growth being concentrated around Northern Boulevard east of Union Street. As of the 2010 United States census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107.

In the 1980s, a continuous stream of Korean immigrants emerged into Flushing, many of whom began as workers in the medical field or Korean international students who had moved to New York City to find or initiate professional or entrepreneurial positions. They established a foothold on Union Street in Flushing between 35th and 41st Avenues, featuring restaurants and karaoke (&quot;noraebang&quot;) bars, grocery markets, education centers and bookstores, banking institutions, offices, consumer electronics vendors, apparel boutiques, and other commercial enterprises. As the community grew in wealth and population and rose in socioeconomic status, Koreans expanded their presence eastward along Northern Boulevard, buying homes in more affluent and less dense neighborhoods in Queens and Nassau County. This expansion has led to the creation of an American &quot;Meokjagolmok&quot;, or Korean &quot;Restaurant Street&quot;, around the Murray Hill station. The eastward pressure to expand was also created by the inability to move westward due to the Flushing Chinatown on Main Street. Per the 2010 United States census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107, representing the largest municipality in the United States with a density of at least 500 Korean Americans per square mile. The Korean American population, consisting of 218,764 individuals in the New York metropolitan area, is the second largest population of ethnic Koreans outside Korea.

&quot;The Korea Times&quot;, a news organization based in Seoul, carries a significant presence in the Long Island Koreatown. The Long Island Koreatown features numerous restaurants that serve both traditional and/or regional Korean cuisine. Korean is spoken frequently alongside English and Chinese varieties, and retail signs employing the Hangul alphabet are ubiquitous. A significant array of social services toward assisting recent and established Korean immigrants is available in Koreatown. There is also a significant population of Korean-Chinese or Chinese-Koreans in Flushing who can speak Mandarin, Korean, and English.

=== Other ethnic communities ===

The neighborhood of East Flushing, technically within Greater Flushing, also houses a substantial Chinese community along with most of Downtown Flushing. However, East Flushing also substantially includes Irish, Greek, Russian, Italian, Jewish, Spanish, and Portuguese communities, as well as communities of Indians, Sri Lankans, Japanese, Malaysians, and Hispanics, mostly Colombians and Salvadorans. This neighborhood tends to be more diverse visibly than Downtown Flushing because of the more even distribution of the ethnicities of East Flushing residents resulting in more ethnic businesses catering to each community rather than the dominance of Chinese and to a lesser extent Korean businesses in Downtown Flushing.

The northeastern section of Flushing near Bayside continues to maintain large Italian and Greek presences that are reflected in its many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants. The northwest is a mix of Jews, Greeks, and Italians. Most of central Flushing is an ethnic mix of Whites, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans.

An area south of Franklin Avenue houses a concentration of Indian, Pakistani, Afghan, and Bangladeshi markets. This concentration of Indian American and other South Asian American businesses south of Franklin Avenue has existed since the late 1970s, one of the oldest Little India neighborhoods in North America. The Sri Maha Vallabha Ganapati Devasthanam (Sanskrit: श्री महावल्लभ गणपति देवस्थानम्, Tamil: ஸ்ரீ மகா வல்லப கணபதி தேவஸ்தானம்) at 45–57 Bowne Street in Flushing was the very first of the traditional Hindu temple organized in North America. However, Indians are migrating eastward into neighborhoods in northeastern Queens and into Nassau County, as with many Chinese and Korean immigrants.

== Subsections ==

=== Broadway–Flushing ===
Broadway–Flushing, also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. The name refers to the area served by the &quot;Broadway&quot; station of the Long Island Rail Road. The Broadway station is located immediately east of the location where the LIRR&#x27;s Port Washington Branch crosses Northern Boulevard, which when the station was opened in 1866 was called &quot;Broadway&quot;. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Much of the area has been rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the neighborhood. Broadway-Flushing is approximately bounded by 29th Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155th Street to the west, and 172nd Streets to the east.

=== Linden Hill ===

Linden Hill is bound by 25th Avenue to Willets Point Boulevard to the north, 154th Street to the east, Northern Boulevard to the south and the Whitestone Expressway to the west.

Linden Hill was originally a rural estate owned by the Mitchell family. Ernest Mitchell owned an adjacent area to the west known as Breezy Hill and his father owned the area now called Linden Hill. The two areas are sometimes referred to as the Mitchell-Linden neighborhood. A major change in the rural nature of Linden Hill occurred in the early 1950s. Neisloss Brothers with architect Benjamin Braunstein envisioned a cooperative project to be set on Linden Hill and landfill on the adjacent swamp to the west which would provide middle-income housing to veterans of World War II and the Korean War. The construction was carried out under Section 213 of the Federal Housing Act of 1950 which provided mortgage insurance for non-subsidized projects. Gerace and Castagna with architects Samuel Paul and Seymour Jarmul subsequently developed the larger Linden Towers several years after this. Paul was additionally the architect of Embassy Arms. In total, 41 six-story buildings containing 3,146 apartments comprising the Linden Hill, Mitchell Gardens, Linden Towers, and Embassy Arms cooperatives were erected.

Once a primarily European-American neighborhood, Linden Hill is now a diverse mix of European-Americans, Asian-Americans and Latino-Americans. The Asian-American population has expanded markedly in the southern part of Linden Hill in the past decade (as it has throughout Flushing) and the Latino-American population has also grown noticeably. Conversely, the European-American population has lessened somewhat, though European-Americans still remain in great numbers north of Bayside Avenue, west of 149th Street.

=== Murray Hill ===

Murray Hill is bounded by 150th Street to the west and 160th Street to the east and straddles ZIP Codes 11354, 11355, and 11358. Traditionally the home of families of Irish and Italian immigrants, many Korean and Chinese immigrants have moved into Murray Hill in recent years. Murray Hill within Flushing is often confused with the larger Murray Hill neighborhood on the East Side of Manhattan.
The Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Murray Hill and Broadway stations serve the area.

Before the area was developed for residential housing in 1889, Murray Hill was the location of several large nurseries owned by the King, Murray, and Parsons families. The Kingsland Homestead has been preserved as the home of the Queens Historical Society. The Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden is also located in Murray Hill. Comic strip artist Richard F. Outcault, the creator of &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; and &quot;Buster Brown&quot;, lived on 147th Street in Murray Hill.

Queensboro Hill in southern Flushing is bordered to the west by College Point Boulevard, to the north by Kissena Park and Kissena Corridor Park, to the south by Reeves Avenue and the Long Island Expressway, and to the east by Kissena Boulevard. Queensboro Hill is a part of ZIP Codes 11355 and 11367 and contains the NewYork–Presbyterian/Queens hospital. One of the leading churches is the Queensboro Hill Community Church, a multi-racial congregation of the Reformed Church in America. Turtle Playground serves the residents of this section of Flushing. This area is often referred to as South Flushing.

=== Pomonok ===
Pomonok is a neighborhood in South Flushing. This large public housing development was built in 1949 on the former site of Pomonok Country Club. The name comes from an Algonquian word for eastern Long Island, and means either &quot;land of tribute&quot; or &quot;land where there is travelling by water&quot;.
In Pomonok, there is also Electchester, a cooperative housing complex at Jewel Avenue and Parsons Boulevard in Pomonok, which was established by Harry Van Arsdale, Jr. and Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in 1949, when Van Arsdale worked with the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry to purchase of the former Pomonok Country Club and build apartment buildings. 5,550 people live in about 2,500 units in 38 buildings, many of which are six-story brick structures. It is served by Public School 200, which is on land donated by Electchester. The union provided the majority of the mortgage. New York state offered tax abatements. Electchester was classified as a &quot;limited dividend nonprofit&quot;, subject to state regulations. The first families paid $475 per room for equity shares, and carrying charges of $26 per month per room, on apartments ranging from three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half rooms.

Both housing complexes are patrolled by the N.Y.P.D.&#x27;s 107th Precinct. There is also an N.Y.P.D. P.S.A.-9 Housing Police Unit station located in the Pomonok Houses.
Pomonok is part of Queens Community District 8.

=== Waldheim ===
The Waldheim neighborhood, an estate subdivision in Flushing constructed primarily between 1875 and 1925, is bound by Sanford and Franklin Avenues on the north, 45th Avenue on the south, Bowne Street on the west and Parsons Boulevard on the east. The area is immediately southeast of the downtown Flushing commercial core, and adjacent to Kissena Park. a small district of upscale &quot;in-town&quot; suburban architecture. Waldheim, German for &quot;home in the woods&quot;, is known for its large homes of varying architectural styles and is laid out in an unusual street pattern.

Waldheim was the home of some of Flushing&#x27;s wealthiest residents until the 1960s. Notable residents include the Helmann family of condiment fame, the Steinway piano-making family, as well as A. Douglas Nash, who managed a nearby Tiffany glass plant. Starting in the 1980s, homes in Waldheim were destroyed by the Korean American Presbyterian Church of Queens, one of the area&#x27;s largest land owners. In 2008, the city rezoned the neighborhood to help preserve the low-density, residential character of the neighborhood. As with the Broadway neighborhood, preservationists have been unable to secure designation as an Historic District by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, and , structures in Waldheim were still being torn down.

The City University of New York School of Law was founded in 1983 adjacent to the Queens College campus, and was located at 65–21 Main Street in Kew Gardens Hills until 2012. It moved to Long Island City for the Fall 2012 Semester. The Law School operates Main Street Legal Services Corp., a legal services clinic.

=== Libraries ===
Flushing contained the first public library in Queens, founded in 1858. Today, Queens Public Library contains five libraries in Flushing.

The largest of the libraries is the Flushing branch, located at the intersection of Kissena Boulevard and Main Street in Flushing&#x27;s central business district. It is the busiest branch of the Queens Public Library, the highest-circulation system in the United States. This library has an auditorium for public events. The current building, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects, is the third to be built on the site—the first was a Carnegie library, built through a gift of Andrew Carnegie.

The other branches are:
* East Flushing – 19636 Northern Boulevard
* McGoldrick – 15506 Roosevelt Avenue
* Mitchell-Linden – 3132 Union Street
* Queensboro Hill – 6005 Main Street

In addition, the Auburndale, Hillcrest, and Pomonok libraries carry Flushing addresses but are not located in Flushing proper.

<text>Nervous tissue, also called neural tissue, is the main tissue component of the nervous system. The nervous system regulates and controls body functions and activity. It consists of two parts: the central nervous system (CNS) comprising the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) comprising the branching peripheral nerves. It is composed of neurons, also known as nerve cells, which receive and transmit impulses to and from it , and neuroglia, also known as glial cells or glia, which assist the propagation of the nerve impulse as well as provide nutrients to the neurons.

Nervous tissue is made up of different types of neurons, all of which have an axon. An axon is the long stem-like part of the cell that sends action potentials to the next cell. Bundles of axons make up the nerves in the PNS and tracts in the CNS.

Functions of the nervous system are sensory input, integration, control of muscles and glands, homeostasis, and mental activity.

==Structure==
Nervous tissue is composed of neurons, also called nerve cells, and neuroglial cells. Four types of neuroglia found in the CNS are astrocytes, microglial cells, ependymal cells, and oligodendrocytes. Two types of neuroglia found in the PNS are satellite glial cells and Schwann cells. In the central nervous system (CNS), the tissue types found are grey matter and white matter. The tissue is categorized by its neuronal and neuroglial components.

===Components===
Neurons are cells with specialized features that allow them to receive and facilitate nerve impulses, or action potentials, across their membrane to the next neuron. They possess a large cell body (soma), with cell projections called dendrites and an axon. Dendrites are thin, branching projections that receive electrochemical signaling (neurotransmitters) to create a change in voltage in the cell. Axons are long projections that carry the action potential away from the cell body toward the next neuron. The bulb-like end of the axon, called the axon terminal, is separated from the dendrite of the following neuron by a small gap called a synaptic cleft. When the action potential travels to the axon terminal, neurotransmitters are released across the synapse and bind to the post-synaptic receptors, continuing the nerve impulse.

Neurons are classified both functionally and structurally.

Functional classification:
*Sensory neurons (afferent): Relay sensory information in the form of an action potential (nerve impulse) from the PNS to the CNS
*Motor neurons (efferent): Relay an action potential out of the CNS to the proper effector (muscles, glands)
*Interneurons: Cells that form connections between neurons and whose processes are limited to a single local area in the brain or spinal cord

Structural classification: 
*Multipolar neurons: Have 3 or more processes coming off the soma (cell body). They are the major neuron type in the CNS and include interneurons and motor neurons.
*Bipolar neurons: Sensory neurons that have two processes coming off the soma, one dendrite and one axon
*Pseudounipolar neurons: Sensory neurons that have one process that splits into two branches, forming the axon and dendrite
*Unipolar brush cells: Are excitatory glutamatergic interneurons that have a single short dendrite terminating in a brush-like tuft of dendrioles. These are found in the granular layer of the cerebellum.
Neuroglia encompasses the non-neural cells in nervous tissue that provide various crucial supportive functions for neurons. They are smaller than neurons, and vary in structure according to their function.

Neuroglial cells are classified as follows:
*Microglial cells: Microglia are macrophage cells that make up the primary immune system for the CNS. They are the smallest neuroglial cell.
*Astrocytes: Star-shaped macroglial cells with many processes found in the CNS. They are the most abundant cell type in the brain, and are intrinsic to a healthy CNS.
*Oligodendrocytes: CNS cells with very few processes. They form myelin sheaths on the axons of a neuron, which are lipid-based insulation that increases the speed at which the action potential, can travel down the axon.
*NG2 glia: CNS cells that are distinct from astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. They serve as the developmental precursors of oligodendrocytes.
*Schwann cells: The PNS equivalent of oligodendrocytes, they help maintain axons and form myelin sheaths in the PNS.
*Satellite glial cell: Line the surface of neuron cell bodies in ganglia (groups of nerve body cells bundled or connected together in the PNS)
*Enteric glia: Found in the enteric nervous system, within the gastrointestinal tract.

===Classification of tissue===
In the central nervous system:
*Grey matter is composed of cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons, protoplasmic astrocytes (astrocyte subtype), satellite oligodendrocytes (non-myelinating oligodendrocyte subtype), microglia, and very few myelinated axons.
*White matter is composed of myelinated axons, fibrous astrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, and microglia.

In the peripheral nervous system:
*Ganglion tissue is composed of cell bodies, dendrites, and satellite glial cells.
*Nerves are composed of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, Schwann cells surrounded by connective tissue. 
The three layers of connective tissue surrounding each nerve are:
*Endoneurium. Each nerve axon, or fiber is surrounded by the endoneurium, which is also called the endoneurial tube, channel or sheath. This is a thin, delicate, protective layer of connective tissue.
*Perineurium. Each nerve fascicle containing one or more axons, is enclosed by the perineurium, a connective tissue having a lamellar arrangement in seven or eight concentric layers. This plays a very important role in the protection and support of the nerve fibers and also serves to prevent the passage of large molecules from the epineurium into a fascicle.
*Epineurium. The epineurium is the outermost layer of dense connective tissue enclosing the (peripheral) nerve.

==Function==

The function of nervous tissue is to form the communication network of the nervous system by conducting electric signals across tissue. In the CNS, grey matter, which contains the synapses, is important for information processing. White matter, containing myelinated axons, connects and facilitates nerve impulse between grey matter areas in the CNS.
In the PNS, the ganglion tissue, containing the cell bodies and dendrites, contain relay points for nerve tissue impulses. The nerve tissue, containing myelinated axons bundles, carry action potential nerve impulses.

==Clinical significance==

===Tumours===
Neoplasms (tumours) in nervous tissue include:

* Gliomas (glial cell tumors)
:Oligoastrocytoma, Choroid plexus papilloma, Ependymoma, Astrocytoma (Pilocytic astrocytoma, Glioblastoma multiforme), Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour, Oligodendroglioma, Medulloblastoma, Primitive neuroectodermal tumor
* Neuroepitheliomatous tumors
:Ganglioneuroma, Neuroblastoma, Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, Retinoblastoma, Esthesioneuroblastoma
* Nerve sheath tumors
:Neurofibroma (Neurofibrosarcoma, Neurofibromatosis), Schwannoma, Neurinoma, Acoustic neuroma, Neuroma

<text>Clark Virgil Terry Jr. (December 14, 1920 – February 21, 2015) was an American swing and bebop trumpeter, a pioneer of the flugelhorn in jazz, and a composer and educator.

He played with Charlie Barnet (1947), Count Basie (1948–51), Duke Ellington (1951–59), Quincy Jones (1960), and Oscar Peterson (1964–96). He was with The Tonight Show Band on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; from 1962 to 1972. His career in jazz spanned more than 70 years, during which he became one of the most recorded jazz musicians, appearing on over 900 recordings. Terry also mentored Quincy Jones, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Wynton Marsalis, Pat Metheny, Dianne Reeves, and Terri Lyne Carrington.

==Early life==
Terry was born to Clark Virgil Terry Sr. and Mary Terry in St. Louis, Missouri, on December 14, 1920. He attended Vashon High School and began his professional career in the early 1940s, playing in local clubs. He served as a bandsman in the United States Navy during World War II. His first instrument was valve trombone.

==Big band era==
Blending the St. Louis tone with contemporary styles, Terry&#x27;s years with Basie and Ellington (who secretly recruited Terry away from Basie) in the late 1940s and 1950s established his prominence. During his period with Ellington, he took part in many of the composer&#x27;s suites and acquired a reputation for his wide range of styles (from swing to hard bop), technical proficiency, and good humor. Terry influenced musicians including Miles Davis and Quincy Jones, both of whom acknowledged Terry&#x27;s influence during the early stages of their careers. Terry had informally taught Davis while they were still in St Louis, and Jones during Terry&#x27;s frequent visits to Seattle with the Count Basie Sextet.

After leaving Ellington in 1959, Clark&#x27;s international recognition soared when he accepted an offer from the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) to become a staff musician. He appeared for ten years on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; as a member of the Tonight Show Band until 1972, first led by Skitch Henderson and later by Doc Severinsen, where his unique &quot;mumbling&quot; scat singing led to a hit with &quot;Mumbles&quot;. Terry was the first African American to become a regular in a band on a major US television network. He said later: &quot;We had to be models, because I knew we were in a test... We couldn&#x27;t have a speck on our trousers. We couldn&#x27;t have a wrinkle in the clothes. We couldn&#x27;t have a dirty shirt.&quot;

Clark has many relationships in the music world and they all speak highly of him. One of those relationships was Quincy Jones, who wrote the preface to Terry&#x27;s autobiography. Jones led a band for the musical &quot;Free and Easy&quot; in 1959, and Terry left Duke Ellington Orchestra to join them in Belgium.

Terry continued to play with musicians such as trombonist J. J. Johnson and pianist Oscar Peterson, and led a group with valve-trombonist Bob Brookmeyer that achieved some success in the early 1960s. In February 1965, Brookmeyer and Terry appeared on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Jazz 625&quot;. and in 1967, presented by Norman Granz, he was recorded at Poplar Town Hall, in the BBC series &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot;, alongside James Moody, Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Bob Cranshaw, Louie Bellson and T-Bone Walker.

In the 1970s, Terry concentrated increasingly on the flugelhorn, which he played with a full, ringing tone. In addition to his studio work and teaching at jazz workshops, Terry toured regularly in the 1980s with small groups (including Peterson&#x27;s) and performed as the leader of his Big B-A-D Band (formed about 1970). After financial difficulties forced him to break up the Big B-A-D Band, he performed with bands such as the Unifour Jazz Ensemble. His humor and command of jazz trumpet styles are apparent in his &quot;dialogues&quot; with himself, on different instruments or on the same instrument, muted and unmuted.

==Later career==

From the 1970s through the 1990s, Terry performed at Carnegie Hall, Town Hall, and Lincoln Center, toured with the Newport Jazz All Stars and Jazz at the Philharmonic, and was featured with Skitch Henderson&#x27;s New York Pops Orchestra. In 1998, Terry recorded George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Call the Whole Thing Off&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;, a tribute to George Gershwin, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease.

In November 1980, he was a headliner along with Anita O&#x27;Day, Lionel Hampton and Ramsey Lewis during the opening two-week ceremony performances celebrating the short-lived resurgence of the Blue Note Lounge at the Marriott O&#x27;Hare Hotel near Chicago.

Prompted early in his career by Billy Taylor, Clark and Milt Hinton bought instruments for and gave instruction to young hopefuls, which planted the seed that became Jazz Mobile in Harlem. This venture tugged at Terry&#x27;s greatest love: involving youth in the perpetuation of jazz. From 2000 onwards, he hosted Clark Terry Jazz Festivals on land and sea, held his own jazz camps, and appeared in more than fifty jazz festivals on six continents. Terry composed more than two hundred jazz songs and performed for eight U.S. Presidents.

He also had several recordings with major groups including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Dutch Metropole Orchestra, and the Chicago Jazz Orchestra, hundreds of high school and college ensembles, his own duos, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, octets, and two big bands: Clark Terry&#x27;s Big Bad Band and Clark Terry&#x27;s Young Titans of Jazz.

In February 2004, Terry guest starred as himself, on &quot;Little Bill&quot;, a children&#x27;s television series. Terry was a resident of Bayside, Queens, and Corona, Queens, New York, later moving to Haworth, New Jersey, and then Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

His autobiography was published in 2011. Taylor Ho Bynum wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that it &quot;captures his gift for storytelling and his wry humor, especially in chronicling his early years on the road, with struggles through segregation and gigs in juke joints and carnivals, all while developing one of most distinctive improvisational voices in music history.&quot;

The &quot;Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings&quot; notes that Terry appears on more of its listed recordings than any other artist. According to his own website Terry was &quot;one of the most recorded jazz artists in history and had performed for eight American Presidents.&quot; He was adept in the challenging technique of circular breathing, by which an instrumentalist can play for extended periods without stopping for breath, and in 1976 he published his &quot;Clark Terry&#x27;s System of Circular Breathing for Woodwind and Brass Instruments&quot;.

In April 2014, the documentary &quot;Keep on Keepin&#x27; On&quot;, followed Terry over four years, to document his mentorship of the 23-year-old blind piano prodigy Justin Kauflin, as Kauflin prepared to compete in an elite, international competition.

In December 2014 the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis and Cécile McLorin Salvant visited Terry, who had celebrated his 94th birthday on December 14, at the Jefferson Regional Medical Center. A lively rendition of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; was played.

==Death and tributes==

On February 13, 2015, it was announced that Terry had entered hospice care to manage his advanced diabetes. He died on February 21, 2015.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Peter Keepnews said Terry &quot;was acclaimed for his impeccable musicianship, loved for his playful spirit and respected for his adaptability. Although his sound on both trumpet and the rounder-toned flugelhorn (which he helped popularize as a jazz instrument) was highly personal and easily identifiable, he managed to fit it snugly into a wide range of musical contexts.&quot;

Writing in UK&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Martin Chilton said: &quot;Terry was a music educator and had a deep and lasting influence on the course of jazz. Terry became a mentor to generations of jazz players, including Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis and composer-arranger Quincy Jones.&quot;

Interviewing Terry in 2005, fellow jazz trumpeter Scotty Barnhart said he was &quot;... one of the most incredibly versatile musicians to ever live ... a jazz trumpet master that played with the greatest names in the history of the music ...&quot;

Southeast Missouri State University hosts the Clark Terry/Phi Mu Alpha Jazz Festival, an annual tribute to the musician. The festival began in 1998, and has grown in size every year. The festival showcases outstanding student musicians and guest artists at the university&#x27;s River Campus.

The University of New Hampshire hosts the Clark Terry Jazz Festival every year; it showcases middle- and high-school jazz musicians from all over New England.

<text>The American Association of Lutheran Churches (AALC, also known as The AALC or TAALC) is a Lutheran church body based in the United States. It was formed on November 7, 1987, as a continuation of the American Lutheran Church denomination, the majority of which merged with the Lutheran Church in America and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The AALC offices were originally in Bloomington, Minnesota. The national office moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 2007, and to Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 2022. In 2008, it had 67 congregations, with about 16,000 members. In 2020, the denomination listed 59 congregations. Its current Presiding Pastor is the Rev. Dr. Cary G. Larson.

==Historical background==

The AALC began with 12 congregations and had, as of 2008, grown to 70 congregations spread across 23 states. The AALC sees itself as a confessional Lutheran church body in the United States. At its beginning, the AALC defined itself by what it saw as maintaining a commitment to the authority of Holy Scripture and the teaching of the Lutheran confessions by way of retaining the Confession of Faith of the American Lutheran Church. 

The AALC operates its own seminary, the American Lutheran Theological Seminary, originally located in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In fall 2005, the seminary relocated to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and is hosted by Concordia Theological Seminary of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS).

The AALC holds to the inerrancy of scripture. It does not ordain women as pastors. However, women may serve as deaconesses. In addition to serving in congregations, its rostered pastors also serve as chaplains in the U.S. Armed Services, hospitals, correctional facilities, law enforcement, hospice, and a host of other specialized ministries.

Some well known confessional Lutheran theologians of the AALC include: Jordan B. Cooper, an author, conference speaker, and host of the Just and Sinner podcast and video channel; Curtis E. Leins, a professor and host of the seminary&#x27;s video channel; and Chris Rosebrough, a conference speaker and host of Pirate Christian Radio and the Fighting for the Faith video channel.

==Fellowship with the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod==
Starting in 1989, representatives of the AALC and the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS) met in a series of official and unofficial talks. After six official meetings, at which various doctrinal papers were submitted, representatives of both the AALC and the LCMS recommended to their respective church bodies that they enter into altar and pulpit fellowship with one another. The proposal was brought before theology/doctrine commissions of each church body before being presented at their respective national conventions. During the June 20–23, 2007, AALC National Convention, the AALC declared fellowship with the LCMS; and voted to join the International Lutheran Council. On July 16, 2007, the LCMS declared fellowship with the AALC during the LCMS 63rd Regular Convention.

==Basic beliefs==

*Affirms the full authority of the Bible as the inerrant and infallible Word of God
*Holds to the Lutheran Confessions because they are the true interpretation of Scripture
*Maintains a purpose focused on the Great Commission with priority for evangelism and world missions
*Affirms the authority of the local congregation as the basic unit of the church

==Presiding pastors==
*Rev. Dr. Duane R. Lindberg 1987–1999
*Rev. Thomas V. Aadland 1999–2007
*Rev. Franklin E. Hays 2007–2014
*Rev. Dr. Curtis E. Leins 2014–2022

<text>Owen Roberts International Airport is an airport serving Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. It is the main international airport for the Cayman Islands as well as the main base for Cayman Airways. The airport is named after British Royal Air Force (RAF) Wing Commander Owen Roberts, a pioneer of commercial aviation in the country, and is one of the two entrance ports to the Cayman Islands.

Owen Roberts International Airport was the only international airport remaining in the Caribbean to have an open-air observation &quot;waving gallery&quot; until January 2017 when it was closed due to reconstruction. The upgraded Owen Roberts International Airport passenger terminal no longer has an outdoor observation &quot;waving gallery&quot;.

The runway length includes a displaced threshold on Runway 26. The Grand Cayman non-directional beacon (Ident: ZIY) is located short of the approach threshold of Runway 08. The Grand Cayman VOR/DME (Ident: GCM) is located short of Runway 08.

==History==
Wg Cdr. Owen Roberts was a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force, during World War II. Following the war, Roberts retired and later founded Caribbean International Airways (CIA). By 1950, Roberts had established regular service between Grand Cayman and Tampa, Florida; Kingston, Jamaica; and British Honduras (now Belize). During the early 1950s, Caribbean International Airlines was operating weekly seaplane service between Grand Cayman and both Tampa and Kingston with Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft as the airstrip on Grand Cayman had yet to be completed. Roberts worked to lobby Cayman Islands Commissioners Ivor Smith and Andrew Gerrard to build airfields on all three of the Cayman Islands. In 1952, construction started on an official airstrip at an estimated cost of £93,000 to construct airports on all three Cayman Islands, a runway, along with a terminal was constructed on Grand Cayman at the cost of £100,000. Owen Roberts had acquired two used Lockheed Lodestar twin-prop airliners purchased to keep up with the competition whose interest was now piqued by the soon-to-be completed airfield at George Town.

The inaugural flight of CIA, Ltd. from Kingston, Jamaica to Grand Cayman was set for 10 April 1953. Tragically, however, the Lodestar piloted by Roberts crashed on takeoff from Palisadoes Airport. 13 people, including the 40-year-old Roberts, were killed. The only survivor of the crash was Roberts&#x27; brother-in-law, Lt. Col. Edward Remington-Hobbs. Roberts was survived by a wife, Patricia, and their two daughters, in London. His grandson unfortunately passed before him, his name was Will Roberts. He died in a car crash in East End with his best friend Spencer Grainger. The Grand Cayman Island Airport was later named after the late Wg Cdr. Roberts in his honour.

On 21 August 2016, the weather station at the airport recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in the Cayman Islands.

== Previous expansion projects ==
In 2007, the Cayman Islands Government announced plans to expand and upgrade the existing airport. Plans include the expansion of the check-in area, the purchase of a new X-ray machine and baggage screening machine as well as the employment of additional passenger screening staff. Phase 1 of the project, the expansion of the airport&#x27;s car parks and the airport&#x27;s pick-up and drop-off locations have already been completed. Additional renovations completed in 2012 include refurbishing the departure hall interior and livening up the passport control and customs hall with aquatic paintings and use of an aggressive digital advertising campaign in the baggage claim area.

== Current expansion projects ==


In 2014, Airport Authority unveiled a new plan to perform major renovations at Owen Roberts International Airport as part of a master plan to renovate and redevelop all three Cayman Islands airports. The new plan would expand the current terminal building, passenger parking, public parking, staff parking, aprons, Taxi area, extend the current runway and in the middle to long term build a second terminal building called the Green space Terminal and a parallel taxiway. This new expansion will allow passenger airlines to fly their newer and larger aircraft to Owen Roberts International. British Airways currently serves the airport with Boeing 777-200 wide-body aircraft. The BA operated 777 is the largest aircraft operating scheduled passenger service from Owen Roberts at the present time with flights to and from London Heathrow Airport (LHR) via an intermediate stop in Nassau, Bahamas in both directions. The expansion can also allow other airlines with wide-body, long haul aircraft, such as the Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Boeing 747-400 and the Boeing 787-9, the opportunity to fly to Grand Cayman.

The expansion work began in 2015 with a temporarily extended departure hall being added to accommodate passenger traffic while the tendering process is completed and construction commenced. On 9 March 2015, the Florida-based company RS&amp;H, which is partnered with the Cayman Island Airport Authority, unveiled a new design for Owen Roberts International. This new design is based mostly on the design criteria created by Canadian firm WS&amp;P in 2014. Work on Owen Roberts estimated to cost around some $55 Million KYD. On 23 June 2015, it was confirmed by CIAA CEO Albert Anderson that construction work would start in early August 2015 and is estimated to be finished in generally 2 years. Late in August 2015, it was determined that work would have to be delayed to early September. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on 10 September 2015. In late October 2015, it was announced that phase 2 of the expansion would start in the early part of 2016.

Phase 1 of the expansion was completed on time and on budget by June 2016. Phase 2 began in July 2016. Part of the phase 2 reconstruction was the removal of the famous and only A-frame open-air observation &quot;waving gallery&quot; in the region as it was closed to the public in January 2017. The expansion of the Terminal Building was completed in late February 2019 and grand reopening was on 27 March by Prince Charles on his royal visit to Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac on 27 &amp; 28 March 2019. The expansion of the Apron area and strengthening and lengthening of the runway and taxiways project began in Summer 2019. A bid for contractors for the runway lengthening project commenced and companies had been chosen. In late 2019 into early 2020 movement of wildlife, clearing of area and filling of the ponds west of the runway, west of threshold 08 had commenced, and construction of runway lengthening and apron expansion has begun. This phase expected was completed by June 2020. Due to faster than expected passenger capacity of the newly redeveloped terminal building. Minister of Tourism announced that the phase of the Airport Master Plan that would see to the development of the second terminal building, also known as the Greenspace Terminal Building has been pushed forwards, to after the runway and apron lengthening and expansion phase. The Greenspace Terminal Building development will also include new Apron development, new runway extension considerations, and jet bridges. In addition to the Greenspace Terminal Building development, additional expansion to seating on the second floor of the redeveloped terminal will be done in the short term.

As a result of the extension of the Grand Cayman Airport, airlines have extended their flight schedules. Recently, American Airlines has added a new nonstop service to Boston, Chicago, and New York-JFK. Delta Air Lines has also expanded its schedules adding new flights to Grand Cayman from New York-JFK and adding additional frequencies from other hubs. Southwest has added service to Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Houston Hobby airport. In addition, United Airlines has drastically expanded its schedules in recent months. This includes new daily nonstop flights from Newark, New Jersey to Grand Cayman through June and twice daily service from Newark in the high season of April. American Airlines flies a mix of Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family aircraft to the island, Delta Airlines flies Boeing 757-200 aircraft, Boeing 737-800/900ER aircraft, and Airbus A320 Family aircraft, JetBlue flies Airbus A320 Family aircraft, Southwest flies a mix of Boeing 737 aircraft and United Airlines flies a mixture of Boeing 737-700/800/900ER aircraft. Cayman Airways, as a result of airport expansion, is planning new routes from the Cayman Islands and is exploring destinations in Canada and Los Angeles, California. The airport expansion brings the gate total to nine gates. Cayman Airways usually uses gates 1–3, American Airlines usually uses Gates 6–9, Jetblue usually uses gate 4 or 5, United Uses Gates 1–4, Delta uses gates 1–5, and Southwest uses Gate 6. All gates deplane via airstairs or ramps and gate assignments do change on occasion. British Airways&#x27; Twice weekly service on the Boeing 777 uses a specially configured Gate 1.

As of 30 November 2020, Owen Roberts International Airport new development project has seen the completion of the 797 ft Runway extension from 08 to near Crewe Road, taking the 7,070 ft runway to the full runway length now 7,867 ft, and the fully paved strip now 8261 ft. Also a new taxiway loop at the end of the runway extension near 08 that saw the movement of taxiways Alpha and Bravo moved to the loop, Charlie and Delta taxiways moved to where the former Alpha and Bravo taxiways were located leading to the general aviation terminal, and Echo and Foxtrot added to where the former Charlie and Delta were leading to the commercial terminal. Due to the build of the runway extension and taxiway loop closer to Crewe Road. A jet blast deflector was erected around the taxiway loop and at the end of the new runway extension dividing the runway from the road. Along with the new taxiway loop and shift in taxiway locations a new parallel taxiway was built and completed creating taxiway Gulf. Also completed in 2020 was the apron extension to the east on the commercial terminal area expanding the aircraft parking stands from 8 to 14. These extensions were opened for operation on 24 February 2021.

==Cayman Airways==
Cayman Airways, the national flag air carrier of the Cayman Islands, has its operational base at the airport. The airline began flights in August 1968 following the purchase of 51% of Cayman Brac Airways by the Cayman Islands Government from LACSA, an air carrier based in Costa Rica. The first aircraft type operated by Cayman Airways was a Douglas DC-3. International service was initially operated to Miami with a leased Douglas DC-6 propliner and the first jet operations were flown between the airport and Kingston, Jamaica with a British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven leased from LACSA. In 1972, the airline was operating its own stretched BAC One-Eleven series 500 jets on nonstop flights to Miami and Kingston as well as operating Douglas DC-3 service between Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Cayman Airways began nonstop flights to Houston via Intercontinental Airport in the late 1970s and by 1982 had replaced its BAC One-Eleven twin jets with Boeing 727-200 jetliners. Other mainline jet aircraft types operated by the airline over the years included Boeing 727-100, 737-200, 737-400, 737-800 and Douglas DC-8 jets. Cayman Airways currently operates four Boeing 737 MAX 8 jetliners with nonstop service to destinations in Cuba, Honduras, Jamaica and the U.S. as well as local flights to Cayman Brac. These jetliners replaced the four 737-300 aircraft that the airline previously operated, the last of which being taken out of service in April 2021. Cayman Airways Express operates two commuter de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and two Saab 340B turboprop aircraft between Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Cayman Airways Express is to eventually retire both of its DHC 6-300 Twin Otters and was also planning to add another Saab 340B to its fleet. Cayman Airways Express was also planning to expand on short haul regional flights but has not yet announced any new schedules. Cayman Airways also operates 1 Cargo flight that flies from Miami to Grand Cayman using a Convair CV-580 twin Prop aircraft.

The initiation of Cayman Airways flights to Panama City, Panama was anticipated to allow Brazilian tourists to travel to the Cayman Islands via Copa Airlines flights to Panama with connecting passengers then continuing on Cayman Airways flights to the airport.

== Historical airline service ==
Grand Cayman was being served with scheduled passenger flights by the early 1950s when British West Indian Airways (BWIA, which is now Caribbean Airlines) in association with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC, which is now British Airways) was operating one round trip flight a week on a routing of Kingston, Jamaica - Grand Cayman - Belize City with a Vickers Viking twin-prop aircraft with this service being timed to connect to other BOAC and BWIA flights in Kingston. LACSA (which now operates as Avianca Costa Rica) was providing service by the mid-1950s with two round trip flights a week, one with a routing of San Jose, Costa Rica - Grand Cayman - Miami flown with a Convair 340 and the other with a routing of San Jose, Costa Rica - Grand Cayman - Havana, Cuba - Miami flown with a Curtiss C-46. By 1957, BWIA in association with BOAC had added Montego Bay, Jamaica as a stop on their Kingston-Belize City route flown weekly via Grand Cayman. BWIA then introduced nonstop flights to Miami and in 1958 was operating Vickers Viscount turboprop aircraft on a round trip routing of Kingston - Montego Bay - Grand Cayman - Miami twice a week. By 1963, British West Indian was operating daily Viscount propjet service into the airport with a round trip routing of Miami (MIA)-Grand Cayman (GCM)-Montego Bay (MBJ)-Kingston (KIN)-San Juan (SJU)-Antigua (ANU)-Barbados (BGI)-Port of Spain, Trinidad (POS). In 1964, LACSA was operating Douglas DC-6B propliner flights on a routing of San Jose, Costa Rica - Grand Cayman - Miami with round trip service twice weekly.

The jet age arrived in Grand Cayman during the late 1960s when BWIA introduced Boeing 727-100 &quot;Sunjet&quot; service with a routing of Port of Spain, Trinidad - Barbados - Antigua - St. Lucia - San Juan, Puerto Rico - Kingston, Jamaica - Grand Cayman - Miami operated twice a week with a third weekly flight also being flown with the 727 nonstop between Grand Cayman and Miami. By 1970, LACSA had introduced jet service as well flying British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jets nonstop to Miami eight times a week and also nonstop to San Jose, Costa Rica twice a week. LACSA continued to serve Grand Cayman through the late 1970s with nonstop flights to Miami operated with stretched BAC One-Eleven series 500 jets. By 1980, Air Jamaica was operating McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service nonstop to Kingston three days a week with a nonstop flight from Montego Bay being operated once a week. Another international airline flying from the airport was Faucett Perú which in 1985 was operating Douglas DC-8 jetliners between Lima, Peru and Miami three days a week via an intermediate stop in Grand Cayman. In 1993, SAHSA, an air carrier based in Honduras, was operating nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service to La Ceiba, Honduras twice a week with continuing direct service to Tegucigalpa, Honduras. By 1994, Air Jamaica was operating Boeing 727-200 jet service on a routing of Montego Bay - Kingston - Grand Cayman three days a week while Trans-Jamaican Airlines (which subsequently became Air Jamaica Express) was flying ATR 42 propjets on a routing of Montego Bay - Kingston - Grand Cayman - Belize City - Cancún, Mexico twice a week.

The first U.S.-based air carrier to serve Grand Cayman was Southern Airways which began service during the mid-1970s with nonstop Douglas DC-9-10 jet service between the airport and Miami. By the late 1970s, Southern was also operating a weekly nonstop between Fort Lauderdale and Grand Cayman flown with the DC-9 in addition to its daily nonstop service to and from Miami.
Southern then merged with another U.S. airline to form Republic Airlines (1979–1986) which in 1979 was continuing to serve the airport with nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 flights to Miami. During the early and mid-1980s Republic was operating larger McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50 jetliners on its Grand Cayman-Miami route. In 1986 Republic was acquired by and merged into Northwest Airlines which in turn continued to serve Grand Cayman. In 1987, Northwest was flying McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets from the airport to Miami, Memphis, Tennessee and Montego Bay, Jamaica with daily nonstop service to all three destinations. U.S.-based regional air carriers Red Carpet Airlines and successor AeroSun International operated service between the airport and Tampa (TPA) with Convair 440 prop aircraft with up to six flights a week during the early 1980s. Red Carpet had previously operated direct Convair 440 and Douglas DC-3 service from the St. Petersburg/Clearwater International Airport (PIE) in Florida to Grand Cayman via an intermediate stop in Cayman Brac (CYB). According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Red Carpet Airlines was also operating interisland flights between the Cayman Islands in 1978 with ten flights a week from Cayman Brac operated with Britten-Norman Trislander and Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft with two of these flights making an intermediate stop on Little Cayman (LYB).

By 1989, American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines and Pan Am had joined Northwest with regard to operating daily nonstop service between Grand Cayman and Miami with American, Eastern and Pan Am all flying Boeing 727-200 jetliners on the route. Locally based air carrier Cayman Airways was also continuing to fly nonstop service with Boeing 737-400 jets on its core Grand Cayman-Miami route at this time in the face of considerable competition posed by these four U.S.-based airlines with all five airlines operating a combined total of sixty (60) departures a week from the airport to Miami in December 1989. By 1994, American had added daily nonstop service to Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina flown with a Boeing 727-200 and had also introduced Boeing 757-200 jetliners on the Grand Cayman-Miami route while USAir (which was subsequently renamed US Airways and has now been merged into American Airlines) was operating nonstop flights to Charlotte, North Carolina three days a week as well as nonstop service to Tampa flown four days a week with both routes being operated with Boeing 727-200 jets.

By the mid-1990s, British Airways had begun operating nonstop service from London Gatwick Airport once a week as well as weekly one stop service from London Gatwick via Nassau with both flights being operated with McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 wide body jetliners. British Airways continues to serve Grand Cayman at the present time with direct Boeing 777-200 wide body flights from London Heathrow Airport via a stop in Nassau.

<doc id="267703" wikidata="Q1432206" url="?curid=267703" title="Norman Manley International Airport">
<text>Norman Manley International Airport , formerly Palisadoes Airport, is an international airport serving Kingston, Jamaica, and is located south of the island away from the centre of New Kingston. It is the second busiest airport in the country after Sangster International Airport, recording 629,400 arriving passengers in 2020 and 830,500 in 2021. Over 130 international flights a week depart from Norman Manley International Airport. Named in honour of Jamaican statesman Norman Manley, it is a hub for Caribbean Airlines. It is located on the Palisadoes tombolo in outer Kingston Harbour; it fronts the city on one side and the Caribbean Sea on the other.

==History==

Jamaica has long had a vibrant civil aviation industry, with the first flight reported in the island on 21 December 1911. This was eight years after the world recorded its first powered flight by the Wright brothers. Nineteen years later, on 3 December 1930, the first commercial flight, a Consolidated Commodore twin-engine flying boat operated by Pan American Airways (which eventually became Pan American World Airways), landed in Kingston Harbour.

The year 1934 was also another historic period for the nation&#x27;s aviation industry when Dr. Albert Ernest Forsythe and C. Alfred &quot;Chief&quot; Anderson (the fathers of African American aviation) arrived in Jamaica from Cuba. This was the first time a land plane arrived at the island by air.

The significant growth in the aviation sector led to the establishment of the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) in 1947. One year later, in 1948, the Kingston Air Traffic Control Centre (KATCC) was established. In the same year, Palisadoes Airport (now Norman Manley International) and Montego Bay Airport (now Sangster International) were established.

The airport was featured in the first James Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962).

From October 1968, it was the hub for Jamaica&#x27;s flag carrier, Air Jamaica, until that airline ceased operations during 2015.

==Renovation==
===Existing terminal renovation===
The contract relating to additions and alterations to the departure concourse has been awarded to Kier Construction Limited and is valued at $161.5M. The work will include construction of a new canopy, north of the existing check-in concourse and departure lounge; construction of an additional drop-off pavement area and provision for access by wheelchair passengers; new lifts, electrical air conditioning, public address, fire detection and fire fighting services; and alterations to the existing check-in concourse and mezzanine level to include a new security post and postal agency.

The architect / engineer for the designs are Llewelyn Davies, Jabobs Consultancy &amp; Leading Edge Aviation Planning Professionals Limited (LEAPP), in conjunction with Peter Jervis and Associates Limited and Grace Ashley and Associates.

===Masterplan===

The project seeks to increase the airport&#x27;s capacity to cater for projected air and passenger traffic at an acceptable level of service to the year 2023. The project is part of a 20-year masterplan which will be implemented in three phases (1A, 1B and 2) and will cost about $130M. By 2022, it will have involved a virtual reconstruction of the entire airport.

The first phase of construction and renovation was completed in 2007. Construction started in June 2006; the intention is for the first phase – which is supposed to make the airport an IATA category C airport – was completed in 2007. The European Investment Bank is providing $40M (2006) for the project and the Caribbean Development Bank has approved a loan of $11m (June 2006) for the new project.

===Phase 1A===
Phase 1A commenced planning in 2004 and was completed in 2007 at an estimated cost of $80M (ground-breaking took place in September 2006). This phase comprises a new departures building at the eastern end of the present terminal to accommodate expansion to the present departure concourse, security screening station with space to accommodate explosives detection equipment, out-going immigration, retail concessions and departure lounge.

Additionally a new multi-level passenger finger (pier) that enables the separation of arriving and departing passengers, as required by security regulations, was included.

Other items in this phase included:
* Nine passenger loading bridges at the new finger (pier)
* Upgraded roadway system and expanded public car park
* Major rehabilitation of the existing departures concourse and related underground services infrastructure
* Major rehabilitation and upgrading of the terminal arrivals area, including immigration hall, customs hall, arrivals arcade, arrivals duty-free shops and offices
* Replacement and upgrading of airport systems – public address, access control, flight information, baggage information, security control and other airport IT systems
* Cargo warehouse complex (the first phase of this complex, called the NMIA cargo and logistics centre, was completed in 2005)

===Phase 1B===
Phase 1B was completed in 2010, and cost approximately $23M. Works under this phase included:
* Further upgrading of existing buildings
* Construction of a new arrivals area
* Installation of new baggage handling facilities
* Movement of the General Aviation Centre, the fire station and other support facilities
* Airside works including the expansion of aircraft parking stands
* Extension of the cargo and maintenance taxiway

===Phase 2===
Phase 2, which is the final phase of the project, commenced in 2013 and is to end in 2022. This phase will involve additional improvement and maintenance works to the terminal, landside, airfield and support areas of the facility at a cost of $9M.

==Statistics==
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 10 April 1953, a Caribbean International Airways Lockheed Lodestar 18-56-23 piloted by Captain Owen Roberts lost an engine on takeoff, climbed to 100–200 feet entering a slight banking turn and crashed into the sea. A failure of the left engine which was proven to be due to the cracking of the accessory drive gear; proved to be the cause of the accident. 13 on board, including the pilot, were killed. There was only one known survivor.
*On 17 July 1960, the captain of a Vickers Viscount of Cubana de Aviación hijacked the aircraft on a flight from José Martí International Airport, Havana, to Miami International Airport, Florida. The aircraft landed at Palisadoes Airport where the captain requested political asylum.
*On 22 December 2009, American Airlines Flight 331, a Boeing 737-800, overshot the runway shortly after 10:00pm during a heavy rain storm and broke up into three pieces, finally coming to a stop approximately 15–20 feet from the sea. All passengers and crew exited the aircraft safely.

<doc id="267705" wikidata="Q1128848" url="?curid=267705" title="Continental Micronesia">
<text>Continental Micronesia, Inc. (CMI) was an American company which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Continental Airlines. It operated daily flights to Honolulu, Hawaii, as well as international services to Asia, Micronesia and Australia from its hub at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam, a U.S. territory in the western Pacific Ocean. During its final years, the airline, a Delaware corporation, was headquartered in the old terminal building at Won Pat International Airport in Tamuning, Guam.

On December 22, 2010, as a result of the Continental-United Airlines merger, the FAA approved the combination of Continental Micronesia&#x27;s air carrier operations with Continental&#x27;s under the single Part 121 operating certificate of Continental; although Continental Micronesia remained as a corporation, all flights were then operated directly by Continental Airlines. This step was intended to simplify future integration steps between Continental and United. The callsign, ICAO and IATA codes were changed to reflect the new operating certificate.

As of 2012, the Continental Micronesia employee group, now a subset of United Continental Holdings, had 1,222 employees. The subsidiary was merged into United effective April 1, 2017. On June 27, 2019 the subsidiary&#x27;s parent company name was changed from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings.
==Code data==
Continental Micronesia flights used the regular Continental &quot;CO&quot; code on ticketing systems and for frequent-flyer benefit accounting, but used its ICAO code &quot;CMI&quot; and callsign &quot;Air Mike&quot; with air traffic control authorities. In airport terminals, Continental Micronesia flights were listed separately (from Continental) with its IATA code &quot;CS&quot;. During the final decade, three airports had both &quot;Air Mike&quot; and mainline Continental present: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Honolulu.

==History==
The airline was established by Continental and other regional shareholders in the former U.S. Trust Territory and started operations on May 16, 1968, as Air Micronesia, hence the nickname and callsign &quot;Air Mike&quot;. Service was started with a Boeing 727-100 jetliner, number 475, which was nicknamed &quot;Ju-Ju,&quot; and a Douglas DC-6B propliner. It also operated two Grumman SA-16/ HU-16 Albatross amphibians to fly from Chuuk (Truk) to Pohnpei (Ponape), until an airfield could be built that could accommodate the 727. The 727&#x27;s underside was coated with teflon, due to it having to operate on coral runways. Additionally, the plane had to carry spare parts and a mechanic, as well as open-water survival gear and (beginning in 1975) onboard doppler radar, then a rarity. The airline also operated Boeing 727-100 Combi aircraft models which were capable of transporting freight pallets on the main deck of the jetliner just aft of the cockpit in addition to passengers seated in the rear coach compartment. By 1983, Continental Micronesia was operating all-passenger Boeing 727-100 and 727-200 aircraft in addition to mixed passenger/freight 727-100 Combi aircraft from its Guam hub.

William H. Stewart of the &quot;Saipan Tribune&quot; stated that the airline&#x27;s foundation &quot;in particular&quot; &quot;was probably the single most important factor in the future development of what were once remote and isolated islands in the Pacific.&quot; Stewart added that the jets &quot;distorted the traveler&#x27;s impression of time and distance and brought the islands closer to major market areas in Asia.&quot; The airline had a virtual monopoly in the Micronesia region. In the 1970s, each district that the airline flew to had an entirely Micronesian employee base, with the exception of Saipan, which housed the airline&#x27;s headquarters. William H. Stewart of the &quot;Saipan Tribune&quot; said the airline &quot;was the only travel link many had with the world beyond the horizon.&quot;

In the early 1980s, the airline started service from Guam to Japan. As Continental&#x27;s share and roles in Air Mike changed, the airline&#x27;s name became &quot;Continental Air Micronesia.&quot; Eventually, Continental owned 100% of Air Mike, which at one point provided the only scheduled service directly between Guam and any point in the 50 United States (namely, to/from Honolulu, Hawaii) although other airlines, notably Pan Am, Braniff International and South Pacific Island Airways, had attempted to provide nonstop service between Guam and Honolulu.

Since May 1987, the company had the contract to provide passenger and cargo service from Honolulu and Guam to the states of Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap.

Before being headquartered in Guam, Continental Micronesia was headquartered in Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands. As time passed, the airline&#x27;s Saipan traffic decreased due to the 1986 breakup of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which was subdivided into smaller political units. Because of the breakup, fewer people needed to travel to Saipan, which had been the capital of the trust territory.

In 1995, Continental Airlines acquired the 9% of the company that it did not already own for $72 million from a group headed by the late Larry Hillblom.

===2000 to 2009===

By 2003, the Guam International Airport Authority moved commuter airlines out of Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport&#x27;s Commuter Terminal and leased the entire facility to Continental. In 2003, it flew from Honolulu to Guam, and from Guam to numerous PacRim and Pacific island destinations.

As of 2004, most of the airline&#x27;s employees were Guam-based, due to the location of the corporate headquarters and the airline&#x27;s main hub. By 2005 Continental Micronesia&#x27;s business on the island of Saipan had decreased, prompting layoffs in Saipan.

Continental Micronesia employed 1,500 people and was Guam&#x27;s largest private-sector employer. It operated 236 departures each week between 23 cities.

Massachusetts-based Cape Air began services in the Mariana Islands under the Continental Connection banner on July 1, 2004. Soon afterward, Continental Micronesia eliminated most jet services to Saipan in favor of Cape Air&#x27;s smaller-sized aircraft and increased frequency.

In 2008, Continental Micronesia generated profits, operating a &quot;niche&quot; Guam-Honolulu route. In addition Japanese tourists, wanting to save money, decided to travel to locations closer to Japan for vacation, so Continental Micronesia gained Japanese passengers. As of that year the airline&#x27;s annual payroll in Guam was $90 million ($ when adjusted for inflation). Thirty percent of the airline&#x27;s business came from its 4,300-mile island-hopper route, which began in Honolulu, made five stops and ended—14 hours and 10 minutes later—in Hagatna, Guam&#x27;s capital city.

In May 2008, expected subsequent military buildup and population growth could have led to an expansion of Continental Micronesia flights to and from Guam. However, on June 12, 2008, Continental&#x27;s announcement of cuts of services, routes and destinations due to high fuel prices included termination of flights to Hong Kong (which has since resumed) and Bali. Also among the cuts is the termination of the Saipan-Manila flights on July 15 which is the last remaining Air Mike flight for Saipan, the airline&#x27;s original hub 40 years ago. According to an opinion columnist for of the &quot;Saipan Tribune&quot;, the “declared” reason for the cancellation of the Saipan-Manila route was the fact that NCLEX tests were now available in Manila, so Filipino nurses no longer had to travel to Saipan to take the test. Before the flight&#x27;s cancellation, the flight also served medical referrals from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to Manila and non-USA visa alien contract workers who were unable to transit to their final destinations via Guam; the author opined that the alien workers “particularly were Air Micronesia’s captive audience.” With only Continental Connection/Cape Air services left, Continental closed its Saipan city ticket office on the same day.

In 2009, the company began operating nonstop service between Honolulu and Nadi, Fiji.

===2010 and beyond===
The United-Continental merger resulted in the elimination of Continental Micronesia&#x27;s operating certificate as the new entity worked towards a single air operator&#x27;s certificate (SOC). The combination of Continental Micronesia&#x27;s operating certificate into Continental&#x27;s was approved on December 22, 2010.

United Airlines announced on March 22, 2017 that the &quot;paper&quot; merger would be completed on April 1, 2017 that would officially fold Continental Micronesia into United Airlines. It was previously a subsidiary of United Continental Holdings.

Since then, flights to Micronesia are now directly operated by United Airlines.

== Destinations ==

Beside providing transportation within Micronesia and between the region and the United States, Continental Micronesia flew to cities in Japan (the region&#x27;s main source of tourists) and other Pacific Rim destinations.

The airline flew to nine Japanese cities, more than any other U.S. carrier. The airline also operated a five stop &quot;island-hopper&quot; route between Honolulu and Guam. The route had an average duration of 14 hours and 10 minutes. Due to the special requirements of the route, each aircraft flying on this route houses an extra pilot, an extra flight attendant, a mechanic, and extra spare parts in case of a mechanical failure. Historically the airline received little competition on the &quot;island-hopper&quot; route. Continental Micronesia provided the only scheduled jet service in the Federated States of Micronesia and Majuro, Marshall Islands. The airline&#x27;s route network linked to the network of its parent company at Honolulu, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and Newark.

Due to small island populations and the corresponding amount of passenger traffic, many of Continental Micronesia&#x27;s routes were flown less than daily (some as infrequent as twice weekly). The only routes with daily flights were between Guam and Fukuoka, Honolulu, Manila, Nagoya, Palau, and Tokyo.

== Fleet ==

As of early 2010, Continental Micronesia operated 12 Boeing 737 and 4 Boeing 767-400 aircraft (in Pacific Configuration) from Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam. The aircraft were all owned by Continental Airlines and were rotated to Continental Micronesia.

=== Former fleet ===
* Boeing 747
* McDonnell Douglas DC-10
* Boeing 727 - includes all-passenger Boeing 727-100 and 727-200 aircraft as well as Boeing 727-100 mixed passenger/freight Combi aircraft
* Boeing 757-200
* Douglas DC-6B (prop aircraft initially assigned to Air Micronesia by Continental Airlines)
* Grumman SA-16 (prop amphibian aircraft initially operated by Air Micronesia)

==Accidents and incidents==
* On November 21, 1980, Air Micronesia Flight 614, operated by a Boeing 727-100C registered N18479, crashed while landing at Yap International Airport on the island of Yap in Micronesia. The aircraft landed heavily short of the airport&#x27;s runway and the right landing gear was torn off. The Boeing 727 then slid along the runway, gradually veering off the side into the jungle. It stopped about from the touchdown point and a fire broke out which destroyed the aircraft. All of the 67 passengers and 6 crew members on board evacuated the burning aircraft and survived the accident.

<doc id="267709" wikidata="Q828386" url="?curid=267709" title="Milan Linate Airport">
<text>Milan Linate Airport is a city airport located in Milan, the second-largest city and largest urban area of Italy. It served 10.6 million passengers in 2024 with 118,060 aircraft movements in 2024, making it one of the busiest airports in Italy. It is the third-busiest airport in the Milan metropolitan area in terms of passenger numbers, after Malpensa and Bergamo, and the second busiest in terms of aircraft movements.

Together with Milan Malpensa Airport and Milan Bergamo Airport, they form the Milan airport system with 56.9 million passengers in 2024, the largest airport system in Italy by number of passengers.

==History==
===Early years===
The airport was built next to Idroscalo of Milan in the 1930s when Taliedo Airport, located from the southern border of Milan and one of the world&#x27;s first aerodromes and airports, became too small for commercial traffic. Linate was completely rebuilt in the 1950s and again in the 1980s.

Its name comes from the small village where it is located in the town of Peschiera Borromeo. Its official name is &quot;Airport Enrico Forlanini&quot;, after the Italian inventor and aeronautical pioneer born in Milan. Linate airport buildings are located in the Segrate Municipality, and the field is located for a large part in the Peschiera Borromeo Municipality.

===Development since 2000===
Since 2001, because of Linate&#x27;s close proximity to the centre of Milan – only east of the city centre, compared with Malpensa, which is 41 km (25 mi) northwest of the city centre – its capacity has been reduced by law from 32 slots per hour (technical capacity) down to 22 slots per hour (politically decided capacity) and only domestic or international flights within the EU or to the United Kingdom have been allowed. That year, 2001, also saw a major accident at Linate with many illegal and non-ICAO-regulation practices and layouts part of its then operation.

From 27 July to 27 October 2019, Linate was closed for runway resurfacing and terminal upgrades. The latter project is expected to continue after the airport&#x27;s reopening, concluding some time in 2021. During this closure, most flights were rerouted to Malpensa, displacing approximately 2.5 million passengers.

In July 2023, Linate Airport was named Europe&#x27;s Best Airport in the 5-10 Million Passenger category by the Airport Council International.

AIRAC A10/23 (valid from 30 November 2023) has determined the new QFU of the runway in 17/35 (was earlier 18/36) due to magnetic variation, and declass of the &quot;old&quot; 17/35 as taxiway only.

==Facilities==
Linate Airport features one three-story passenger terminal building. The ground level contains the check-in and separate baggage reclaim facilities as well as service counters and a secondary departure gate area for bus-boarding. The first floor features the main departure area with several shops, restaurants and service facilities. The second floor is used for office space. The terminal building features five aircraft stands, all of which are equipped with jet-bridges. Several more parking positions are available on the apron which are reached from several bus-boarding gates.

The airport is on level 4+ of the Airport Carbon Accreditation.

==Airlines and destinations==

The following airlines operate scheduled services to and from Linate Airport:
==Statistics==



==Ground transport==
===Metro===
The Milan Metro Line 4 connects the airport to the city centre with a travel time of about 15 minutes.

===Bus and coach===
The airport can be reached by coach services from other places within the city. Coaches from and to Monza, Brescia and Milan Malpensa Airport are also available.

The ATM bus &quot;73&quot; used to serve a route from Piazza Duomo in the city centre to the Airport, as well as San Felice. The urban section of the line was cut to only serve the neighborhood of Forlanini when the M4 metro opened, and the line was subsequently renamed to the &quot;973.&quot; Recently, plans have been set forward to reintorduce service back along the former route to Piazza Cinque Giornate. Other bus lines serve Linate as well, including the ATM 901 and 903, and the suburban buses Z509 and K511.

===Car===
The airport is located in &quot;Viale Enrico Forlanini&quot; next to its intersection with &quot;Autostrada A51&quot; (exit &quot;6 Aeroporto Linate&quot;). A51 is part of the city&#x27;s highway ring, so the airport can be reached from any direction.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 6 December 1948, an Avio Linee Italiane (ALI) Douglas DC-3 crashed on takeoff in fog. All seven occupants died.
* On 8 October 2001, Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 686, bound for Copenhagen Airport, collided with a business jet during severe fog, led the Cessna to taxi inadvertently into the runway in use. This collision later resulted in criminal and legal proceedings against 11 staff, including an air traffic controller, flight safety officials and management officials from the airport. All 114 people on both aircraft were killed, as well as four people on the ground. The Linate Airport disaster remains the deadliest air disaster in Italian history.
* On 1 June 2003, a Learjet 45 operated by &quot;Eurojet Italia&quot; crashed shortly after takeoff because of birdstrikes affecting both engines and loss of control attempting an emergency landing back at Linate. Both pilots were killed.
* On 15 June 2005, a light aircraft safely landed on taxiway &#x27;T&#x27; after its pilot had mistaken it for runway 36R. Following that incident, a safety recommendation was issued. It suggested the use of different numbers to help differentiate between runways. This change was enacted at the beginning of July 2007, when 18R/36L became 17/35 and 18L/36R became 18/36.
* On 3 October 2021, a privately owned Pilatus PC-12 that had just taken off from Linate Airport crashed into an empty building, killing all eight passengers and crew on board. The plane was heading for Olbia on the island of Sardinia, but it came down soon after takeoff on the outskirts of the city near the metro station at San Donato Milanese, near Milan. The victims included businessman Dan Petrescu, one of the wealthiest people in Romania at the time; his wife, his son, and five others, including a one-year-old baby. Several empty parked cars caught fire after the crash near the metro station, emergency workers said. Firefighters worked to extinguish the flames rising from the building, which was reportedly under reforms.

<text>Orio al Serio International Airport, also styled as Milan Bergamo Airport for commercial purposes, () is the third-busiest international airport in Italy. 
The airport is also officially called Il Caravaggio International Airport after the Baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, who originally hailed from the nearby town of Caravaggio.

The airport served almost 17,4 million passengers in 2024 and is one of Ryanair&#x27;s three largest operating bases, along with Dublin Airport and London Stansted Airport.

The airport is located in Orio al Serio, southeast of Bergamo and northeast of Milan. Together with Milan Malpensa Airport and Milan Linate Airport, it forms the Milan airport system serving the Milan metropolitan area, that with 56.9 million passengers in 2024 constitutes the largest airport system in Italy by number of passengers.

==Overview==
The airport is managed by SACBO, a company partially owned by &quot;SEA – Aeroporti di Milano&quot;, the operator of Linate and Malpensa airports. SEA, the company that runs the latter two airports, also holds a 31% stake in SACBO. 
The airport has one passenger terminal and two jet-bridge gates.

The terminal is split into two zones, A (Gates A1-A15) and B (Gates B1-B5). Gates A13 and B5 are equipped with boarding bridges; the remaining gates are remote gates.

In March 2021, DHL Aviation announced plans to relocate their hub from Bergamo to Milan Malpensa Airport where DHL opened new logistics facilities. In early 2022, DHL confirmed the end of all operations at Bergamo.

<doc id="267720" wikidata="Q202979" url="?curid=267720" title="Cordell Hull">
<text>Cordell Hull (October 2, 1871July 23, 1955) was an American politician from Tennessee and the longest-serving U.S. Secretary of State, holding the position for 11 years (1933–1944) in the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during most of World War II. Before that appointment, Hull represented Tennessee for two years in the United States Senate and 22 years in the House of Representatives.

Hull received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945 for his role in establishing the United Nations, and was referred to by President Roosevelt as the &quot;Father of the United Nations&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Cordell Hull was born in a log cabin in Olympus, Tennessee, which is now part of Pickett County, Tennessee, but was then part of Overton County. He was the third of the five sons of William Paschal Hull (1840–1923) and Mary Elizabeth Hull (née Riley) (1841–1903). His brothers were named Orestes (1868), Sanadius (1870), Wyoming (1875), and Roy (1881).

According to John Gunther, Hull&#x27;s father had tracked down and killed a man because of a blood feud. His mother was a descendant of Isaac Riley, who was granted in near Byrdstown in Pickett County, for Revolutionary War service, as well as Samuel Wood who emigrated from Leicestershire, England on the ship &quot;Hopewell&quot; and fought in the Virginia Militia. Hull&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family (Riley-Wood) had numerous ancestors who fought in the Revolutionary War. Hull devoted a section in his memoirs &quot;Cabin on the Hill&quot; to dispelling an old rumor that his father was part Cherokee Indian, and subsequent documented family history has confirmed his ancestry.

Hull attended college from 1889 until 1890. He gave his first speech at the age of 16. At the age of 19, Hull became the elected chairman of the Clay County Democratic Party. Hull studied at National Normal University (later merged with Wilmington College, Ohio) from 1889 until 1890. In 1891, he graduated from Cumberland School of Law at Cumberland University and was admitted to the bar.

==Early career==
Hull served in the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1893 until 1897. During the Spanish–American War, he served in Cuba as a captain in the Fourth Regiment of the Tennessee Volunteer Infantry.

Hull was elected to the United States House of Representatives where he served 11 terms (1907–1921 and 1923–1931) totaling 22 years. As a member of the powerful Ways and Means committee, he fought for low tariffs and claimed authorship of the federal income tax laws of 1923 and 1926 and the inheritance tax of 1926. He also served as a local judge from 1913 to 1917. After his defeat in the congressional election of 1920, he served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He was one of several candidates for president at the 1928 Democratic National Convention, which ultimately chose Al Smith as nominee. Hull was influential in advising Albert Gore, Sr. to run for the U.S. Congress in 1938. Hull recorded twenty-five years of combined service in the House and the Senate.

==Secretary of State==


Hull won election to the Senate in 1930, but resigned from it in 1933 to become Secretary of State. Hull became one of Roosevelt&#x27;s strongest Southern allies during the 1932 presidential campaign.

Roosevelt named him Secretary of State and appointed him to lead the American delegation to the London Economic Conference, which then collapsed when Roosevelt rejected its main plans. In 1943, Hull served as United States delegate to the Moscow Conference. At all times, his main objective was to enlarge foreign trade and lower tariffs. The more important issue of the American role in World War II was handled by Roosevelt who worked through Sumner Welles, the second-ranking official at the State Department. Hull did not attend the summit meetings that Roosevelt had with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. In 1943, Hull finally destroyed Welles&#x27;s career by threatening to expose his homosexuality.

In a speech in 1937, New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia said that brown-shirted Nazis ought to be featured as the &quot;climax&quot; of a chamber of horrors in the upcoming World&#x27;s Fair. The Nazi government organ, &quot;Der Angriff&quot;, called the mayor a &quot;Jewish Ruffian&quot; who had been bribed by Jewish and Communistic agents and was a criminal disguised as an officeholder. In the ensuing exchanges, Hull sent a letter of regret to Berlin for intemperate comments on both sides, but he also explained the principle of freedom of speech. As the response of Nazi propaganda organs rose in pitch to include characterizing American women as &quot;prostitutes,&quot; Hull sent a letter of protest to Berlin, which elicited an &quot;explanation&quot; but no apology.

In 1938, Hull engaged in a dialog with Mexican Foreign Minister Eduardo Hay concerning the failure of Mexico to compensate Americans who lost farmlands during agrarian reforms in the late 1920s. He insisted that compensation must be &quot;prompt, adequate and effective&quot;. Though the Mexican Constitution guaranteed compensation for expropriation or nationalization, nothing had yet been paid. While Hay admitted Mexico&#x27;s responsibility, he replied that there is &quot;no rule universally accepted in theory nor carried out in practice which makes obligatory the payment of immediate compensation...&quot; The so-called &quot;Hull formula&quot; has been adopted in many treaties concerning international investment but is still controversial, especially in Latin American countries, which have historically subscribed to the Calvo doctrine, which suggests that compensation is to be decided by the host country and that as long as there is equality between nationals and foreigners and no discrimination, there can be no claim in international law. The tension between the Hull formula and the Calvo doctrine is still important in the law of international investment.

Hull pursued the &quot;Good Neighbor Policy&quot; with Latin American nations, which has been credited with preventing Nazi subterfuge in that region. Hull and Roosevelt also maintained relations with Vichy France, which Hull credited with allowing General Henri Giraud&#x27;s forces to join allied forces in the North African campaign against Germany and Italy.

Hull also handled formal statements with foreign governments. Notably he sent the Hull note just prior to the Pearl Harbor attack, which was formally titled &quot;Outline of proposed Basis for Agreement Between The United States and Japan.&quot; Hull received news of the attack while he was outside his office. The Japanese ambassador Kichisaburō Nomura and Japan&#x27;s special envoy Saburō Kurusu were waiting to see Hull with a 14-part message from the Japanese government that officially notified of a breakdown in negotiations. The United States had broken Japanese encryption, and Hull knew the message contents. He blasted the diplomats: &quot;In all my fifty years of public service, I have never seen such a document that was more crowded with infamous falsehood and distortion.&quot;

Hull chaired the Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy, which was created in February 1942.

When the Free French Forces of Charles de Gaulle occupied the islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, south of Newfoundland, in December 1941, Hull lodged a very strong protest and went as far as referring to the Gaullist naval forces as &quot;the so-called Free French.&quot; His request to have the Vichy governor reinstated was met with strong criticism in the American press: newspapers mocked the &quot;so-called Secretary of State&quot;. The islands remained under the Free French until the end of the war. Hull, who always held de Gaulle in disregard, if not detestation, even before the incident, would never cease trying to maneuver against him during the rest of the war.

===Jews and SS &quot;St. Louis&quot; incident===
In 1939, Hull advised Roosevelt to reject the SS &quot;St. Louis&quot;, a German ocean liner carrying 936 Jews seeking asylum from Germany. Hull&#x27;s decision sent the Jews back to Europe on the eve of the Holocaust. Some historians estimate that 254 of the passengers were ultimately murdered by the Nazis.

Okay ...there were two conversations on the subject between (Secretary of the Treasury) Morgenthau and Secretary of State Cordell Hull. In the first, 3:17 PM on 5 June 1939, Hull made it clear to Morgenthau that the passengers could not legally be issued U.S. tourist visas as they had no return addresses. Furthermore, Hull made it clear to Morgenthau that the issue at hand was between the Cuban government and the passengers. The U.S., in effect, had no role. In the second conversation at 3:54 PM on June 6, 1939, Morgenthau said they did not know where the ship was and he inquired whether it was &quot;proper to have the Coast Guard look for it&quot;. Hull responded by saying that he didn&#x27;t see any reason why it could not. Hull then informed him that he did not think that Morgenthau would want the search for the ship to get into the newspapers. Morgenthau said &quot;Oh no. No, no. They would just—oh, they might send a plane to do patrol work. There would be nothing in the papers.&quot; Hull responded &quot;Oh, that would be all right.&quot;

In September 1940, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt maneuvered with another State Department official to bypass Hull&#x27;s refusal to allow Jewish refugees aboard a Portuguese ship, the SS &quot;Quanza&quot;, to receive visas to enter the U.S. Through her efforts, the Jewish refugees disembarked on September 11, 1940, in Virginia. In a similar incident, American Jews sought to raise money to prevent the mass murder of Romanian Jews but were blocked by the State Department. &quot;In wartime, in order to send money out of the United States, two government agencies had to sign a simple release—the Treasury Department under Henry Morgenthau and the State Department under Secretary Cordell Hull. Morgenthau signed immediately. The State Department delayed, delayed, and delayed, as more Jews were dying in the Transnistria camps.&quot;

In 1940, Jewish representatives in the USA lodged an official complaint against the discriminatory policies the State Department was using against the Jews. The results were fatal: Hull gave strict orders to every USA consulate worldwide forbidding the issuing of visas to Jews ... At the same time a Jewish congressman petitioned Roosevelt, requesting his permission to allow twenty thousand Jewish children from Europe to enter the USA. The President did not respond to the petition.

===Establishing the United Nations===
Hull was the underlying force and architect in the creation of the United Nations, as recognized by the 1945 Nobel Prize for Peace, an honor for which Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated him. During World War II, Hull and Roosevelt had worked toward the development of a world organization to prevent a third World War. Hull and his staff drafted the &quot;Charter of the United Nations&quot; in mid-1943.

==Later years==
Hull resigned on November 30, 1944, due to failing health. To this day he remains the longest-serving US Secretary of State, having served for eleven years and nine months in the post. Roosevelt described Hull upon his departure as &quot;the one person in all the world who has done his most to make this great plan for peace (the United Nations) an effective fact&quot;. The Norwegian Nobel Committee honored Hull with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945 in recognition of his efforts for peace and understanding in the Western Hemisphere, his trade agreements, and his work to establish the United Nations.

In January 1948, Hull published his two-volume memoirs, an excerpt from which appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
At the age of 45, in 1917, Hull married a widow, Rose Frances (Witz) Whitney (1875–1954), of an Austrian Jewish family of Staunton, Virginia. The couple had no children. Mrs. Hull died at age 79, in Staunton, Virginia, in 1954. She is buried in Washington D.C. at Washington National Cathedral.

Hull died on July 23, 1955, at age 83, at his home in Washington, D.C., after a lifelong struggle with familial remitting-relapsing sarcoidosis (often confused with tuberculosis). He is buried in the vault of the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea in the Washington National Cathedral.

==Legacy==
Hull&#x27;s memory is preserved by Cordell Hull Dam on the Cumberland River near Carthage, Tennessee. The dam impounds Cordell Hull Lake, covering approximately 12,000 acres (49 km2).

His law school, Cumberland School of Law, continues to honor him with a Cordell Hull Speaker&#x27;s Forum and the Moot Court Room.

A statue of Hull graces the campus of Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee.

Cordell Hull Birthplace State Park, near Byrdstown, Tennessee, was established in 1997 to preserve Hull&#x27;s birthplace and various personal effects Hull had donated to the citizens of Pickett County, including his Nobel Peace Prize.

A segment of Kentucky highway routes 70, 90, 63, and 163, from Mammoth Cave National Park near Cave City south to the Tennessee State Line near Hestand, is named &quot;Cordell Hull Highway&quot;, and is part of that state&#x27;s scenic byway system.

The Cordell Hull Building, on Capitol Hill in Nashville, Tennessee, is a secure 10-story building that contains the offices of the Tennessee Legislature.

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building (formerly the Old Executive Office Building) in Washington, DC, next to the White House, contains the ornately decorated &quot;Cordell Hull Room&quot; on the second floor, which is used for meetings. The room was Cordell Hull&#x27;s office when he served as U.S. Secretary of State.

Cordell Hull Park, located at 13415 Warren Avenue in the East Garrison neighborhood, an unincorporated area of Monterey County, California, is approximately 0.75-acre in size and contains a basketball court, playground, and a grassy playfield.

The U.S. Postal Service issued a 5-cent commemorative stamp honoring Cordell Hull on October 5, 1963.

Hull is one of the presidential cabinet members who are characters in the musical &quot;Annie&quot;.

<doc id="267724" wikidata="Q1567857" url="?curid=267724" title="Port of Varna">
<text>Port of Varna () (map) is the largest seaport complex in Bulgaria. Located on the Black Sea&#x27;s west coast on Varna Bay, along Lake Varna and Lake Beloslav, it also comprises the outlying port of Balchik. It has a significant further development potential with of sheltered inland waterfront on the lakes alone, easily accessible by road and railroad and adjacent to Varna International Airport.

== Overview ==

There are two anchorages at Varna roadstead: summer and winter. If violent northeasterly wind and wave conditions make the anchorages hazardous, a foul weather anchorage is available west of the high Cape Kaliakra east-northeast of Varna.
Two inland canals connect the sea and Port of Varna East with Lake Varna, Lake Beloslav and Port of Varna West: Channel 1 with draft 11.5 m and Channel 2 with draft 11.0 m. The canals form an island (Острова) on which a deepwater oil terminal, among other port facilities, is currently located. The depths of the ship berths and the approaches allow the handling of vessels of capacity up to 50,000 gross tons. In view of the stated safe canal depths, only vessels of draft less than and airdraft up to are allowed to Varna West. Vessels with load over 200 m, beam over 26 m, or over 20,000 gross tons are required to pass the channels during daylight hours only. The largest vessel handled (as of 2006) is the Norwegian Dream cruise ship (220 m in length, 50,700 gross tons).

Port of Varna offers full service: loading, discharging, stevedoring, freight forwarding, storage and various intermodal services. 

East terminal 
* 14 berths
* 2,345 m berth
* 97,600 m2 open storage
* 41,258 m2 covered storage

West terminal
* 22 berths
* 3,430 m berth
* 346,393 m2 open storage
* 37,806 m2 covered storage
* 10,000 m3 liquid storage
It has a well-forked railway and road network. The existing port facilities allow the handling of practically all kinds of solid bulk, break-bulk, containerized and some liquid-bulk cargoes.

Principal exports include urea, soda ash, cement, clinker, silica, fertilisers, grain, containers and ro-ro.
Principal imports are coal, metals, ores and ore concentrates, oil, phosphates, timber, molasses, containers and ro-ro.

Since 2006, Port of Varna serves as a hub for BP and German wind turbine manufacturer Saga.

In 2008, the port posted a 57% growth in overall tonnage handled, and at times in late summer it was stretched beyond capacity, due to redirected cargo from striking ports in the region and the year&#x27;s record export of wheat from northeastern Bulgaria.

== Future plans ==

The updated general plan for the Port of Varna to 2020 was approved in 1999. Major projects for new construction, reconstruction and modernization include: a deepwater container terminal and a ro-ro terminal on the island under the Asparuhov most bridge, a grain terminal on the north shore of Lake Varna south of the &quot;Dry Port&quot; storage base, a liquid chemicals terminal and a cement and clinker terminal at Varna West, and modernization of the passenger and ro-ro terminals at Varna East.

In 2007, new plans were disclosed to relocate the container terminal from Varna East to a new larger basin on the northeastern shore of Lake Varna and to redevelop old port Varna East, located in the city centre, into a large marine attractions zone with a new cruise terminal, yacht marina, apartments, hotels, restaurants, museums, exhibitions, shopping, and other tourist facilities.

In 2008, plans were disclosed for another deepwater container terminal on the south side of the island for vessels carrying over 2500 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU).

A liquified petroleum gas terminal is also being developed at Beloslav. Amidst the gas crisis of early 2009, discussions started of a new liquified natural gas terminal on , possibly on the northwestern shore of Lake Varna at Ezerovo.

Also in 2008, discussions were resumed (suspended in 1981) for a 192 km long navigable canal Rousse–Varna connecting the lower river Danube with the Varna lakes and the Black Sea, but this enterprise is still considered economically unfeasible and utopian by many.

Other existing port terminals include the Cruise Terminal; Petrol, LesPort, and Varna Thermal Power Plant (handling oil, timber, and coal respectively); the Railroad Ferry Terminal, which is not part of the complex, is located on the south shore of Lake Beloslav opposite Varna West.

In June 2023 the European Investment Bank signed an agreement with Logistic Centre Varna EAD for a €50 million loan to co-finance a new grain terminal at the Black Sea port of Varna, expected to be operational in 2026.

<doc id="267730" wikidata="Q1147513" url="?curid=267730" title="Mike Schmidt">
<text>Michael Jack Schmidt (born September 27, 1949) is an American former professional baseball third baseman who spent his entire 18-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Philadelphia Phillies from 1972 to 1989. Schmidt was a 12-time All-Star and a three-time winner of the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player award (MVP), and he was known for his combination of power hitting and strong defense. As a hitter, he compiled 548 home runs and 1,595 runs batted in (RBIs), and led the NL in home runs eight times and in RBIs four times. As a fielder, Schmidt won the National League Gold Glove Award for third basemen ten times. Schmidt was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995 in his first year of eligibility, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest third basemen in baseball history.

Having an unusual batting stance, Schmidt turned his back somewhat toward the pitcher and rocked his rear end back and forth while waiting for a pitch. By standing far back in the batter&#x27;s box, he made it almost impossible to jam him by pitching inside.

Teammate Pete Rose once said, &quot;To have his body, I&#x27;d trade him mine and my wife&#x27;s, and I&#x27;d throw in some cash.&quot;

==Early life==
Schmidt&#x27;s parents were Joseph Jack Schmidt (1926–2011) and Lois Jane Philipps (1926–2019). They managed the Philipps Aquatic Club founded by Lois&#x27;s great-grandfather Charles A. Philipps in 1865. Schmidt was a lifeguard at the club.

At age 5, Schmidt climbed a tree and was electrocuted when he touched a wire; his heart stopped and he fell, causing his heart to restart. He survived with minimal burn marks.

Schmidt was a standout athlete in both Little League Baseball and in 3 sports at Fairview High School in Dayton, Ohio, from which he graduated in 1967. However, knee surgeries ended his participation in basketball and football. He then attended Ohio University in Athens, where he joined the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.

==Baseball career==
===Amateur career===
At Ohio University, Schmidt led the Ohio Bobcats baseball team to the College World Series in and was selected as the shortstop for the 1970 College Baseball All-America Team. Schmidt was drafted by the Phillies in the second round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft, 30th overall.

===Minor Leagues===
On June 11, , Schmidt was signed by Phillies scout Tony Lucadello, who had followed him since high school. Six days later, Schmidt made his professional debut in an exhibition game between the Phillies and their Double-A affiliate the Reading Phillies in Reading, Pennsylvania. Schmidt played the whole game at shortstop for the Phillies, hitting a game-winning home run against his future Reading teammates. Schmidt stayed in Reading, spending the rest of the 1971 season at the Double-A level. In 1972, he was promoted to the Triple-A Eugene Emeralds of the Pacific Coast League. Along with shortstop and third base, Schmidt was also a second baseman during his time in the minor leagues.

===Major Leagues===
====1972–1979====
Schmidt spent two seasons in the Phillies&#x27; farm system, where he batted .263 with 34 home runs and 122 runs batted in. After playing most of the season for Triple-A Eugene, he was called up to the Phillies in September and made his major league debut against the New York Mets on September 12. Four days later, in Philadelphia on September 16, Schmidt ended Montreal Expos pitcher Balor Moore&#x27;s streak of 25 scoreless innings pitched with his first career home run.

Following the 1972 season, the Phillies dealt third baseman Don Money to the Milwaukee Brewers to open a spot for Schmidt in their infield. While he batted only .196 with 136 strikeouts during his first full season in , Schmidt demonstrated his power potential by hitting 18 home runs.

Schmidt had a breakout season in , increasing his batting average to .282 and playing in the first of his twelve Major League Baseball All-Star Games. On June 10, in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, Schmidt hit a ball off Houston Astros&#x27; pitcher Claude Osteen that looked like a sure home run. The ball hit a public address speaker suspended 117 feet above and 329 feet away from home plate, falling into center field. By the ground rules, it remained in play and Schmidt was held to just a single, with the runners on first and second each advancing just one base. It is believed that had the ball not hit the speaker, it would have traveled beyond 500 feet. For the season, Schmidt finished sixth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting as he batted .282 with 116 RBIs and a league-leading 36 home runs to help the Phillies avoid a last-place finish in the National League East for the first time since . His 404 assists in 1974 remains a record for third basemen.

Schmidt&#x27;s batting average hovered below .200 through May . After solid performance in July and August, his average rose to .249 by the end of the season as he led the league in home runs for the second year in a row, with 38. Schmidt started the season by hitting 12 home runs in Philadelphia&#x27;s first 15 games, including four in one game on April 17, placing him on the list of Major League Baseball single-game home run leaders and becoming the 10th player in major league history to accomplish that feat. For the season, Schmidt drove in 107 runs, led the league in home runs for the third year in a row (38), and won his first of ten Gold Gloves to lead the Phillies to their first division crown since division play started in .

In 1977, Schmidt signed a contract with the Phillies that paid him $561,500 per year (), making him the highest-paid player in baseball history to that point and the first to surpass $500,000 annually.

The Phillies captured the NL East crown three years in a row; however, they were swept by Cincinnati&#x27;s &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; in 1976, and lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in and . On December 5, 1978, the Phillies signed Pete Rose as a free agent, temporarily making Rose the highest-paid athlete in team sports with a four-year, $3.2-million contract. With Rose on board, the Phillies were early favorites to repeat as division winners in . Instead, the Phillies finished the season at 84–78, and in fourth place in NL East. For his part, Schmidt broke the club record for home runs in a season with 45, eclipsing Chuck Klein&#x27;s 43 homers in .

====1980–1986====
On October 3, , the Phillies played against Montreal, tied with the Expos for first place in the NL East. With a sacrifice fly in the first, and a solo home run in the sixth, Schmidt led the Phillies to a 2–1 victory to capture first place. A day later, Schmidt hit his 48th home run of the season in the 11th inning to give the Phillies the 6–4 extra innings victory over the Expos, and clinch the division. His 48 home runs broke his own team record, and led the National League by a margin of 13 over his nearest competitor. Coupled with a league-leading 121 RBIs, his home runs made Schmidt a unanimous choice for the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award.

The Phillies defeated the Houston Astros in the 1980 National League Championship Series to reach the World Series for the third time in franchise history. Though Schmidt had just a career .191 post-season batting average with no home runs and five RBIs, his bat came alive in the 1980 World Series, hitting two homers and driving in seven runs against the Kansas City Royals. The Phillies beat the Royals in six games to win the first World Series in franchise history, and Schmidt won the World Series MVP Award. Following the World Series, Schmidt and four of his Phillies teammates appeared on &quot;Family Feud&quot; for one week in 1980. He, Larry Bowa, Garry Maddox, Dick Ruthven and Del Unser took on five members of the Kansas City Royals: Dennis Leonard, Dan Quisenberry, Paul Splittorff, John Wathan and Willie Wilson.

Schmidt&#x27;s best season may have been the strike-shortened season. His 31 home runs were seven more than anyone else in the league. He also led the NL in runs scored, RBIs, total bases and walks, and set personal highs in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage. He won his second consecutive MVP award, this time with 96% of the vote.

The Phillies led the NL East by 3.5 games when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike hit. As a result, the Phillies were named NL East champions for the first half of the season; however, they lost to the second-half champion Montreal Expos in the 1981 National League Division Series.

In , in celebration of the team&#x27;s 100th anniversary, Schmidt was voted by fans the greatest player in the history of the franchise. That year, he led the league in home runs for the sixth time in his career to lead the Phillies back to the postseason. Schmidt led his team with a .467 batting average and scored five runs as they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1983 National League Championship Series. It was, however, a much different story against the Baltimore Orioles in the 1983 World Series. The Phillies were held to a .195 team batting average; Schmidt went just 1-for-20 with a single.

Following the 1983 season, Schmidt was awarded the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award. That off-season, Pete Rose left the Phillies as a free agent and signed with the Montreal Expos. With a hole at first base, the Phillies played Tim Corcoran and Len Matuszek in a platoon system during the season. Neither player provided the offensive spark Rose did, and so a change was in order. Early in the season, Schmidt agreed to move to first base (starting from late May) through the end of the season with Rick Schu assuming third base duties. The Phillies finished with a record below .500 for the first time since 1974.

In , the Phillies moved outfielder Von Hayes to first base and shifted Schmidt back to third base. He responded by winning his third MVP award, a record for third basemen, with a league-leading 37 home runs and 119 RBIs. As of 2025, Schmidt is the most recent player to have led his league in RBIs four times.

====1987–1989====

Trailing the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–5 in the top of the ninth inning at Three Rivers Stadium on April 18, , Schmidt became a member of the 500 home run club, hitting a three-run shot off of Don Robinson. It put the Phillies ahead 8–6, and ended up being the game-winner.

Injuries to Schmidt&#x27;s rotator cuff caused him to miss the last month and a half of the season. He returned healthy for the season. However, after a poor start, Schmidt suddenly chose to announce his retirement in San Diego, on May 29. Although he typically demonstrated little emotion on the field, and was known as &quot;Captain Cool&quot; by many in Philadelphia sports circles, Schmidt surprised many with an emotional, and occasionally tearful, retirement speech. He said in his retirement press conference, &quot;Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio, with two very bad knees and a dream of becoming a major-league baseball player; I thank God this dream came true.&quot; His last game was May 28, 1989, against the San Francisco Giants.

Despite his own perceived subpar start and subsequent retirement on May 29, fans once again voted Schmidt to be the starting third baseman for the NL All-Star team. He decided not to play, but he did participate in the opening ceremony of the 1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in uniform.

==Career statistics==


Over his career, Schmidt set a vast array of hitting and fielding records. In addition to his MVP Awards, Schmidt won ten Gold Gloves, led the league in home runs eight times, in RBIs four times, OPS five times, and walks four times. He was named to 12 All-Star teams. He is the Phillies&#x27; all-time leader in games played, at-bats, plate appearances, runs scored, home runs, RBI, walks, strikeouts, total bases, runs created, sacrifice flies, outs, Adj. Batting Runs, Adj. Batting Wins, Extra Base Hits, Times On Base, and Power-Speed number. Schmidt&#x27;s 548 home runs are the most ever hit by a player who spent his entire career with just one team.

Schmidt is one of only three players (along with Willie Mays and Ken Griffey Jr.) to win 10 Gold Gloves and hit at least 500 home runs, and is the only infielder ever to do so.

==Post-playing career and accolades==
In 1990, Schmidt was named &quot;The Player of the Decade&quot; of the 1980s by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

His uniform number 20 was retired by the Phillies before a game at Veterans Stadium on May 26, 1990. That same season, Mike was inducted as a member of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame. He had previously been inducted as the third baseman for the Phillies&#x27; Centennial Team in 1983.

In 1991, he and Nolan Ryan were inducted into the Peter J. McGovern Little League Museum&#x27;s Hall of Excellence, established in 1988, thereby becoming only the second and third MLB players inducted into the Hall.

In 1995, on his first ballot, Schmidt was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum with what was at the time the fourth highest voting percentage ever, 96.52%.

In 1997, Schmidt was elected as the starting third-baseman by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America to the Major League Baseball All-Time Team. The event was celebrated at the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Cleveland, Ohio.

In 1999, he ranked number 28 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking third baseman, and the highest-ranking player whose career began after 1967.

Also in 1999, he was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the starting third-baseman. The event was celebrated at the 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Boston, Massachusetts.

Schmidt was honored with a statue outside the third-base gate at Citizens Bank Park in 2004.

On September 27, 2006, Schmidt was announced as the Phillies representative for the DHL Hometown Heroes promotion, beating out Steve Carlton, Richie Ashburn, Robin Roberts and Chuck Klein as most outstanding player in Phillies history.

In October 2014 the Ohio University Bobcats baseball team retired his number 10. Schmidt led the Bobcats to the College World Series in 1970.

In 2015, Schmidt was named one of the Phillies &quot;Franchise Four&quot; as voted by the fans, along with Steve Carlton, Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts.

Schmidt has been a vocal advocate for the reinstatement of Pete Rose to baseball.

In July 2005, on Bob Costas&#x27;s HBO show &quot;Costas Now&quot; Schmidt said, &quot;if I had played during that era I would have taken steroids&quot;. In his 2006 book, &quot;Clearing the Bases: Juiced Players, Monster Salaries, Sham Records, and a Hall of Famer&#x27;s Search for the Soul of Baseball&quot;, he somewhat recanted that statement, saying that he understood the desire to get a competitive advantage even though he could not condone breaking the rules to do so.

===Coaching===
Starting in 2002, Schmidt worked with the Phillies as a hitting coach during each Spring training. In October 2003, Schmidt was named the manager of the Phillies&#x27; Single A Florida State League affiliate, the Clearwater Threshers. He managed them for just the 2004 season, then resigned. In 2009, he served as third-base coach for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic.

===Broadcasting===
NBC used Schmidt as a guest analyst for Game 1 of the 1989 NLCS. Schmidt subsequently, did on-field reporting throughout the series. Schmidt also provided periodic commentary (albeit, taped prior to the playoffs) for ABC during the 1988 National League Championship Series.

Schmidt spent the 1990 season as a color analyst with the Phillies broadcast team on the now-defunct PRISM network, where he was partnered with play-by-play announcer Jim Barniak, and was known to be very candid and honest with his commentary. From 2014 to 2019, he served as a color analyst for the Phillies. Starting in 2014, he provided commentary during Sunday home games on NBC Sports Philadelphia. In 2015, Schmidt also provided commentary during Saturday home games, creating a &quot;Weekends with Schmidt&quot; format. He returned to NBC Sports Philadelphia as a color commentator during Phillies games in 2022.

==Personal life==
In February 1974 Schmidt married Donna Wightman; they had two children. In 1979, they bought a 12,000 square foot home in Upper Providence Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania for $490,000. In 1991, they bought an 8,500 square foot house in the Admiral’s Cove golf community in Jupiter, Florida for $425,000.

In 2014, Schmidt disclosed that he had stage-3 melanoma in the summer of 2013, but that he was now cancer-free. In conjunction with the Richard David Kann Melanoma Foundation, the City of Philadelphia, and Independence Blue Cross, the Phillies placed 12 sunblock dispensers around Citizens Bank Park in May 2017.

===Philanthropy===
In , Schmidt began sponsoring an annual fishing tournament in Grand Bahama Island. It has raised a total of over $2.5 million for charities including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, American Cancer Society, and Cleveland Clinic.

In 2008, Schmidt released a wine called Mike Schmidt 548 Zinfandel, a reference to his 548 career home runs, with proceeds also going to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

He also regularly participates in charity golf tournaments.

<doc id="267753" wikidata="Q1137707" url="?curid=267753" title="RoboCup">
<text>RoboCup is an annual international robotics competition founded in 1996 by a group of university professors (including Hiroaki Kitano, Manuela M. Veloso, Itsuki Noda and Minoru Asada). The aim of the competition is to promote robotics and AI research by offering a publicly appealing – but formidable – challenge.

The name &quot;RoboCup&quot; is a contraction of the competition&#x27;s full name, &quot;Robot World Cup Initiative&quot; (based on the FIFA World Cup), but there are many other areas of competition such as &quot;RoboCupRescue&quot;, &quot;RoboCup@Home&quot; and &quot;RoboCupJunior&quot;. Claude Sammut is the current president of RoboCup, and has been since 2019.

The official goal of the project is:
:&quot;By the middle of the 21st century, a team of fully humanoid robot soccer players shall win a soccer game, complying with the official rules of FIFA, against the winner of the most recent World Cup.&quot;

==RoboCup leagues==

The contest currently has six major domains of competition, each with a number of leagues and sub-leagues. These include:

* RoboCup Soccer
**Standard Platform League (formerly Four Legged League)
**Small Size League
**Middle Size League
**Simulation League
***2D Soccer Simulation
***3D Soccer Simulation
**Humanoid League
*RoboCup Rescue League
**Rescue Robot League
**Rescue Simulation League
**Rapidly Manufactured Robot Challenge
*RoboCup@Home, which debuted in 2006, focuses on the introduction of autonomous robots to human society
**RoboCup@Home Open Platform League (formerly just RoboCup@Home)
**Robocup@Home Domestic Standard Platform League
**RoboCup@Home Social Standard Platform League
*RoboCup Logistics League, which debuted in 2012, is an application-driven league inspired by the industrial scenario of a smart factory
*RoboCup@Work, which debuted in 2016, &quot;targets the use of robots in work-related scenarios&quot;
*RoboCup Junior
**Soccer League
**OnStage (formerly Dance) League
**Rescue League
**Rescue CoSpace League

Each team is fully autonomous in all RoboCup leagues. Once the game starts, the only input from any human is from the referee.

==RoboCup editions==
The formal RoboCup competition was preceded by the (often unacknowledged) first International Micro Robot World Cup Soccer Tournament (MIROSOT) held by KAIST in Taejon, Korea, in November 1996. This was won by an American team from Newton Labs, and the competition was shown on CNN.

RoboCup was canceled in 2020 due to COVID-19. The planned host location of Bordeaux will host in 2023.

<text>In botanical nomenclature, variety (abbreviated var.; in ) is a taxonomic rank below that of species and subspecies, but above that of form. As such, it gets a three-part infraspecific name. It is sometimes recommended that the subspecies rank should be used to recognize geographic distinctiveness, whereas the variety rank is appropriate if the taxon is seen throughout the geographic range of the species.

==Example==
The pincushion cactus, &quot;Escobaria vivipara&quot;, is a wide-ranging variable species occurring from Canada to Mexico, and found throughout New Mexico below about . Nine varieties have been described. Where the varieties of the pincushion cactus meet, they intergrade. The variety &quot;Escobaria vivipara&quot; var. &quot;arizonica&quot; is from Arizona, while &quot;Escobaria vivipara&quot; var. &quot;neo-mexicana&quot; is from New Mexico.

==Definitions==

The term is defined in different ways by different authors. However, the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants, while recognizing that the word &quot;variety&quot; is often used to denote &quot;cultivar&quot;, does not accept this usage. Variety is defined in the code as follows: &quot;Variety (varietas) the category in the botanical nomenclatural hierarchy between species and form (forma)&quot;. The code acknowledges the other usage as follows: &quot;term used in some national and international legislation for a clearly distinguishable taxon below the rank of species; generally, in legislative texts, a term equivalent to cultivar. See also: cultivar and variety (varietas)&quot;.

A variety will have an appearance distinct from other varieties, but will hybridize freely with those other varieties.

==Other nomenclature uses==
* In plant breeding nomenclature, at least in countries that are signatory to the UPOV Convention, &quot;variety&quot; or &quot;plant variety&quot; is a legal term.
* In zoological nomenclature, the only allowed rank below that of species is that of subspecies. A name that was published before 1961 as that of a variety is taken to be the name of a subspecies. A name published after 1960 as that of a variety does not formally exist. In zoology, forms and morphs are used informally if needed, but are unregulated by the &quot;ICZN&quot;.
* The bacteriological nomenclature uses the term subspecies. Some names were published as &quot;varieties&quot; before 1992 but the terminology is now disallowed; names that were published as varieties are taken to be published as subspecies.
* In viticulture nomenclature, what is referred to as &quot;grape varieties&quot; are in reality cultivars according to usage in the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants&quot; or &quot;plant varieties&quot; in the legal sense rather than botanical taxonomy varieties, since they are propagated by cuttings and have properties that are not stable under sexual reproduction. However, usage of the term variety is so entrenched in viticulture that a change to cultivar is unlikely.

<doc id="267785" wikidata="Q7617836" url="?curid=267785" title="Who Goes There?">
<text>Who Goes There? is a 1938 science fiction horror novella by American author John W. Campbell, written under the pen name Don A. Stuart. Its story follows a group of people trapped in a scientific outpost in Antarctica infested by shapeshifting monsters able to absorb and perfectly imitate any living being, including humans. &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; was first published in the August 1938 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine and was also printed as The Thing from Another World, as well as included in the collection by the same title. Its extended, novel version, found in an early manuscript titled Frozen Hell, was finally published in 2019.

&quot;Who Goes There?&quot; has been adapted to film in 1951 as &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, by Christian Nyby, and again more directly in 1982 as &quot;The Thing&quot;, by John Carpenter. The story&#x27;s many other adaptations, and works inspired by it, have spanned various media.

==Publication history==
Two slightly different versions of the original novella exist. It was first published in the August 1938 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; in a 12-chapter version, which also appears in &quot;Adventures in Time and Space&quot; and &quot;The Antarktos Cycle: Horror and Wonder at the Ends of the Earth&quot; (under the title &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;). An extended 14-chapter version was later included in &quot;The Best of John W. Campbell&quot; and the collection &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;. In 1973, the story was voted by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the stories representing the &quot;most influential, important, and memorable science fiction that has ever been written.&quot; It was promptly published with the other top voted stories in &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two&quot;.

In 2018, it was discovered that &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; was actually a shortened version of Campbell&#x27;s unpublished larger novel with working titles &quot;Frozen Hell&quot; and &quot;Pandora&quot; (a reference to the legend of Pandora). Two of its draft versions, including an entirely different opening, were found in a box of manuscripts sent by Campbell to Harvard University. The discovery was made by author and biographer Alec Nevala-Lee, during his research on a biography of Campbell and other authors from the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Campbell first attempted selling the story to &quot;Argosy&quot;, but was rejected by its editor John &quot;Jack&quot; Francis Byrne. After some rewriting and significant trimming, it was eventually accepted by &quot;Astounding&quot;″s editor F. Orlin Tremaine. A Kickstarter campaign was launched to publish the full novel that same year. When completed, the campaign had raised more than $155,000, compared to its original $1,000 goal. An edited version of the two original drafts was published by Wildside Press under the full title &quot;Frozen Hell: The Book That Inspired The Thing&quot;, illustrated by Bob Eggleton and with a preface by Nevala-Lee and an introduction by Robert Silverberg. E-book versions of the novel began distributing digitally to campaign backers on January 16, 2019, with physical copies following in June the same year.

==Plot==
A group of American researchers, isolated in their scientific station in Antarctica towards the end of winter, discover an alien spaceship buried in the ice, where it crashed twenty million years before. They try to thaw the inside of the spacecraft with a thermite charge but end up accidentally destroying it when the ship&#x27;s magnesium hull is ignited by the charge. They do recover an alien creature from the ancient ice, which the researchers believe was searching for heat when it was frozen. Thawing revives the alien, a being which can assume the appearance, memories, and personality of a living thing it devours, while maintaining its body mass for further reproduction. Unknown to them, the alien immediately kills and then imitates the crew&#x27;s physicist, a man named Connant; with some 90 pounds of its matter left over, it tries to become a sled dog. The crew discovers the dog-Thing and kills it midway through the transformation process. Pathologist Blair, who had lobbied for thawing the Thing, goes insane with paranoia and guilt, vowing to kill everyone at the base to save mankind; he is isolated within a locked cabin at their outpost. Connant is also isolated as a precaution, and a &quot;rule-of-four&quot; is initiated in which all personnel must remain under the close scrutiny of three others.

The crew realizes that they must isolate their base and therefore disable their airplanes and vehicles, yet they pretend that everything is normal during radio transmissions, to prevent any rescue attempts. The researchers try to figure out who may have been replaced by the alien (simply referred to as the Thing), to destroy the imitations before they can escape and take over the world. The task is found to be almost impossibly difficult when they realize that the Thing is shapeshifting and telepathic, reading minds and projecting thoughts. A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections (from Copper and Garry) to provide a human-immunity serum test, as in rabbits. The initial test of Connant is inconclusive, as they realize that the test animal received both human and alien blood, meaning that either Doctor Copper or expedition Commander Garry is an alien. Assistant commander McReady takes over and deduces that all the other animals at the station, save the test dog, have already become imitations; all are killed by electrocution and their corpses burned.

Everyone suspects each other by now but must stay together for safety, deciding who will take turns sleeping and standing watch. Tensions mount and some men begin to go mad, thinking that they are already the last human, or wondering if they could know if they were not human any longer. Ultimately, Kinner, the cook, is murdered and accidentally revealed to be a Thing. McReady realizes that even small pieces of the creature will behave as independent organisms. He then uses this fact to test which men have been &quot;converted&quot; by taking blood samples from everyone and dipping a heated wire in the vial of blood. Each man&#x27;s blood is tested, one at a time, and the donor is immediately killed if his blood recoils from the wire. Fourteen men, including Connant and Garry, are revealed to be Things. The remaining men go to test the isolated Blair, and on the way, see the first albatross of the Antarctic spring flying overhead; they shoot the bird to prevent a Thing from infecting it and flying to civilization.

When they reach Blair&#x27;s cabin, they discover that he is a Thing. They realize that it has been left to its own devices for a week, coming and going as it pleased, as it is able to squeeze under doors by transforming itself. With the creatures inside the base destroyed, McReady and two others enter the cabin to kill the Thing that was once Blair. McReady forces it out into the snow and destroys it with a blowtorch. Afterwards, the trio discover that the Thing was dangerously close to finishing the construction of a nuclear-powered anti-gravity device that would have allowed it to escape to the outside world.

==Characters==
===Humans===
Although the expedition based at Big Magnet comprises 37 members, only 16 are named in the story, and all but three by last name alone. By the end of the story, 15 of them have been replaced by alien impostors.
* Barclay: present at alien excavation.
* Benning: aviation mechanic. He survives. He appears in the 1982 adaptation renamed George Bennings with the occupation of meteorologist, and is portrayed by Peter Maloney.
* Blair: biologist, present at alien excavation. Blair goes insane after the Thing escapes, due to his desire to thaw the Thing. Blair is locked in the tool shed, where he is replaced by a Thing. Blair appears in the 1982 adaptation portrayed by A. Wilford Brimley.
* (Bart) Caldwell: a member of the team.
* Clark: dog handler. Clark is later revealed to be a Thing. He appears in the 1982 adaptation, played by Richard Masur.
* Connant: physicist, cosmic ray specialist. He is the first member of the team to be assimilated. In &quot;Frozen Hell&quot;, he is given the first name Jerry.
* Dr. Copper: physician, present at the alien excavation. Copper appears in the 1982 adaptation portrayed by Richard Dysart.
* (Samuel) Dutton: revealed to be a Thing.
* Garry: expedition commander. Garry is eventually revealed as a Thing and killed. Garry appears in the 1982 adaptation portrayed by Donald Moffat.
* Kinner: scar-faced cook. Kinner is later revealed to be a Thing.
* McReady: expedition second-in-command, meteorologist, present at alien excavation. McReady appears in the 1982 adaptation portrayed by Kurt Russell, now with the name &quot;R.J. MacReady&quot; and the occupation of the helicopter pilot. MacReady reappears in the video game played by Russell and in the comics based on the film.
* (Vance) Norris: muscular physicist. Norris appears in the 1982 adaptation portrayed by Charles Hallahan, though he is given Kinner&#x27;s fate and much of Kinner&#x27;s characterization.
* Pomroy: livestock handler.
* Ralsen: sledge keeper.
* Van Wall: chief pilot, present at alien excavation.

===Non-humans===
* &quot;The Thing&quot;, the antagonist, is a malevolent, shapeshifting alien life form. It appears in all three film adaptions. In the first film (1951), the Thing is depicted as a tall, menacing humanoid alien that is composed of vegetable matter. In the two later film adaptions, the Things retain their ability to shapeshift, although they do not have telepathic abilities.
* Charnauk: lead Alaskan husky, first openly attacked by the Thing.
* Chinook and Jack: two other huskies.

==Adaptations and spin-offs==
===Films===
&quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951) is a loose adaptation of the original story. It features James Arness as the Thing, Kenneth Tobey as Air Force officer, and Robert O. Cornthwaite as the lead scientist. In this adaptation, the alien is a humanoid invader (i.e., two arms, two legs, a head) from an unknown planet. A plant-based life form, the alien and its race need animal blood to survive. He, or rather it, is a one-alien army, capable of creating an entire army of invaders from seed pods contained within its body.

The film &quot;Horror Express&quot; (1972) borrows heavily from Campbell&#x27;s story, but was not an official adaptation nor is Campbell or his story credited in the film. Starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, it moves the setting to the Trans-Siberian Railway in the year 1906, where a fossilised Neanderthal-type creature that was found buried in the ice is being transported by an archaeologist. After the creature thaws, it comes to life and stalks the passengers on the train. A blood test reveals it to be the host for an alien being that came to Earth in prehistoric times and capable of possessing any living being it comes into contact with. The alien is capable of jumping from person to person as well as absorbing their memories, prompting a search among the train passengers to determine who the alien now is, while it attempts to obtain the knowledge it needs to build a space craft.

The John Carpenter 1982 adaptation &quot;The Thing&quot;, from a screenplay by Bill Lancaster, sticks more closely to Campbell&#x27;s original story. Carpenter remade the film due to &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; being one of his favorite films, and the 1951 adaptation featured on a television in Carpenter&#x27;s original &quot;Halloween&quot;. Carpenter&#x27;s idea was not to compete with the direction of the earlier film. In both the novella and this adaptation, the Thing can imitate any animal-based life form, absorbing the respective hosts&#x27; personalities and memories along with their bodies (although the telepathy aspect is omitted). When the story begins, the creature has already been discovered and released from the ice by another expedition. This version maintains the digestions and metamorphoses alluded to in the original novella, via practical effects such as animatronics.

A prequel to the Carpenter version, also titled &quot;The Thing&quot;, was released in 2011. It was directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and written by Eric Heisserer, replacing traditional special effects of the original film with computer generated imagery. In response to this, the special effects artist Alec Gillis crowdfunded and made the film &quot;Harbinger Down&quot; in 2015.

During the early 2000s, Frank Darabont and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick of Darkwoods Productions worked on &quot;Return of the Thing&quot;, a four-part miniseries project for Sci Fi Channel. In 2020, a new film was announced to be produced by Jason Blum&#x27;s Blumhouse Productions and released and distributed by Universal Pictures (as a part of the former&#x27;s first-look deal). The project is based on the &quot;Frozen Hell&quot; edition of the story. John Carpenter later confirmed that he was involved with the project. In May 2023, he acknowledged his involvement with a direct sequel to his original film.

===Literature===
Héctor Germán Oesterheld and Alberto Breccia adapted the story as &quot;Tres ojos&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Three Eyes&quot;) for their &quot;Sherlock Time&quot; series, published in the Argentine comic book &quot;Hora Cero&quot; (issues 89–104) from May to August 1959. In 1976, the story was also published in comic book form in issue 1 of &quot;Starstream&quot; with script by Arnold Drake and art by Jack Abel.

William F. Nolan, author of &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, wrote an unfilmed screen treatment of &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; for Universal Studios in 1978; it was published in 2009 in the Rocket Ride Books edition of &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;. Nolan&#x27;s alternate take on Campbell&#x27;s story reduced the number of characters and downplayed monster elements in favor of an &quot;impostor&quot; theme in a vein similar to &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; by Jack Finney.

An early draft of Lancaster&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;The Thing&quot; was novelised by Alan Dean Foster in 1982 and released simultaneously with the film. Because it was an early draft, it featured several scenes that differed greatly from those found in the finished film, and two of the supporting characters have different names.

In 1991, Dark Horse Comics published a two-issue miniseries &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; written by Chuck Pfarrer and drawn by John Higgins. It was followed in 1992 by a four-issue sequel, &quot;The Thing from Another World: Climate of Fear&quot;, written by John Arcudi, and further by &quot;The Thing from Another World: Eternal Vows&quot; drawn by Paul Gulacy in 1993. An alternative sequel to the film, &quot;The Thing from Another World: Questionable Research&quot;, drawn by Ted Naifeh, was serialized in 1993. An unrelated standalone prequel story, &quot;The Thing: The Northman Nightmare&quot;, written by Steve Niles, was published as a digital comic in 2011.

In 2010, Canadian science fiction writer Peter Watts published a short story in Clarkesworld Magazine titled &quot;The Things&quot; in which the alien entity from &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; is the first-person narrator. The characters and events are the same as those in the 1982 John Carpenter adaptation. Clarkesworld also released an audio version of this story as part of their podcast series.

In 2019, Wildside Press published &quot;Short Things&quot;, a collection of short stories inspired by &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot;. Edited by John Betancourt, &quot;Short Things&quot; features written contributions by G.D. Falksen (&quot;Appolyon&quot;), Paul Di Filippo (&quot;Thingmaker&quot;), Mark McLaughlin (&quot;The Horror on a Superyacht&quot;), Alan Dean Foster (&quot;Leftovers&quot;), Darrell Schweitzer (&quot;The Interrogator&quot;), Nina Kiriki Hoffman (&quot;Good As Dead&quot;), Kristine Kathryn Rusch (&quot;A Mission at T-Prime&quot;), Chelsea Quinn Yarbro (&quot;The&quot;), Kevin J. Anderson (&quot;Cold Storage&quot;), Pamela Sargent (&quot;Two Wars&quot;), Allen M. Steele (&quot;According to a Reliable Source&quot;), Allan Cole (&quot;The Monster at World&#x27;s End&quot;), and Betancourt himself (&quot;The Nature of the Beast&quot;). It also contains illustrations by Dan Brereton, Marc Hempel and Mark Wheatley, among others.

===Radio dramas===
The story has been adapted as a radio drama multiple times, the earliest was for the &quot;Exploring Tomorrow&quot; radio series in 1958 (under the title &quot;The Escape&quot;), hosted by the novel&#x27;s author John W. Campbell, Jr.. However, no recordings of this episode are known to exist. Subsequently, the story was adapted as part of the radio drama series &quot;Chillers&quot; (2002) and &quot;Suspense&quot; (2013).

===Games===
&quot;The Thing&quot; (2010 card game) and &quot;The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31&quot; (2017 board game) are both based on the John Carpenter 1982 film. In 2002, Universal Interactive and Konami co-published the video game &quot;The Thing&quot;, a third-person shooter and survival horror sequel to the film. Rockstar Dundee was working on another video game adaptation of the film but it was cancelled after the studio became part of Rockstar Games in 2020.

&quot;Who Goes There?&quot;, a board game from Certifiable Studios, was released in 2018, following a Kickstarter campaign, which raised over $612,000 compared to its $54,097 goal. In 2020, Certifiable Studios launched a Kickstarter for a second edition of the game, promising updated mechanics and additional characters. It is available either as a complete game or as an add-on for those who have already bought the first edition.

==Cultural impact==
===Literature===
In December 1936, John W. Campbell himself had published a short story titled &quot;Brain Stealers of Mars&quot; in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, which also features shape-shifting, mind-reading aliens. The earlier story has a humorous tone, but takes a philosophical note as members of another alien race describe living stoically alongside the shapeshifters.

A. E. van Vogt was inspired by &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; to write &quot;Vault of the Beast&quot; (1940), which he submitted to &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. &quot;I read half of it standing there at the news-stand before I bought the issue and finished it,&quot; van Vogt later recalled. &quot;That brought me back into the fold with a vengeance. I still regard that as the best story Campbell ever wrote, and the best horror tale in science fiction.&quot;

The Thing is one of the aliens featured in &quot;Barlowe&#x27;s Guide to Extraterrestrials&quot; (1979; second edition 1987). Barlowe&#x27;s main illustration depicts the Thing halfway through its transformation into a sled dog.

The story is referenced, and embedded within &quot;The Rack of Baal&quot; (1985), a &#x27;choose-your-own-adventure&#x27; gamebook written by Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson, about a time-travelling special agent called &quot;The Falcon&quot;. A section of the plot plays out on a frozen world occupied by a single mining station crewed by only a few people. One inhabitant is called &#x27;Sil McReady&#x27;, who, in a cynical inversion of the original story, actually turns out to be infected with the alien organism.

===Film and television===
&quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot;, the 1976 serial which concluded the thirteenth season of the science fiction TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, combined elements from Campbell&#x27;s original storyline (an expedition in Antarctica unearths an ancient alien specimen that has lain dormant in the ice for thousands of years) with elements of the 1951 film version (the alien is a carnivorous walking vegetable, not a shape-shifting impersonator).

The 1993 episode &quot;Ice&quot; of &quot;The X-Files&quot; borrows its premise from the storyline.

The 1993 episode &quot;Aquiel&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; contains an isolated space outpost and the murderer is eventually revealed to be a shapeshifting lifeform.

In the 1995 episode &quot;The Adversary&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, a shapeshifting alien infiltrates the crew of a starship. The episode explores similar themes of paranoia and contains a &quot;blood test&quot; scene. The writers have cited &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; as inspiration.

In the 1999 episode &quot;Trust No One&quot; of &quot;&quot;, H.E.A.T. encounters two DNA monsters that could take the form of many creatures and even themselves. Both creatures become one in an attempt to procreate but are destroyed by H.E.A.T. and Godzilla. The episode seems to borrow elements from John Carpenter&#x27;s film.

The 2013 episode &quot;The Thingy!&quot; of the family action-comedy series &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot; also borrows the story&#x27;s premise, albeit in a much more comedic tone.

The 2020 film &quot;Friend of the World&quot; is influenced by &quot;The Thing&quot; with themes of body horror and isolation. A title on its soundtrack is named after the novella.

===Other===
In 2006, Dark Horse Comics released a pre-painted snap together model kit of the alien as described in the original short story. It was sculpted and painted by Andrea Von Sholly. The model was unlicensed and was simply titled &#x27;The Space Thing&#x27;.

<doc id="267787" wikidata="Q7375868" url="?curid=267787" title="Rubbing alcohol">
<text>Rubbing alcohol, also known as surgical spirit in some regions, refers to a group of denatured alcohols commonly used as topical antiseptics. These solutions are primarily composed of either isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) or ethanol, with isopropyl alcohol being the more widely available formulation. Rubbing alcohol is rendered undrinkable by the addition of bitterants or other denaturants.

In the British Pharmacopoeia, the equivalent product is called surgical spirit. Beyond antiseptic uses, rubbing alcohol has various industrial and household applications. In North American English, the term &quot;rubbing alcohol&quot; generally encompasses both isopropyl and ethanol-based products.

The &quot;United States Pharmacopeia&quot; (&quot;USP&quot;) defines &quot;isopropyl rubbing alcohol USP&quot; as containing approximately 70 percent alcohol by volume of pure isopropyl alcohol and defines &quot;rubbing alcohol USP&quot; as containing approximately 70 percent by volume of denatured alcohol. In Ireland and the UK, the comparable preparation is surgical spirit B.P., which the &quot;British Pharmacopoeia&quot; defines as 95% methylated spirit, 2.5% castor oil, 2% diethyl phthalate, and 0.5% methyl salicylate.
Under its alternative name of &quot;wintergreen oil&quot;, methyl salicylate is a common additive to North American rubbing alcohol products. Individual manufacturers are permitted to use their own formulation standards in which the ethanol content for retail bottles of rubbing alcohol is labeled as and ranges from 70 to 99% v/v.

All rubbing alcohols are unsafe for human consumption: isopropyl rubbing alcohols do not contain the ethyl alcohol of alcoholic beverages; ethyl rubbing alcohols are based on denatured alcohol, which is a combination of ethyl alcohol and one or more bitter poisons that make the substance toxic.

==History==
The term &quot;rubbing alcohol&quot; came into prominence in North America during the Prohibition era of 1920 to 1933, when alcoholic beverages were prohibited throughout the United States. The term &quot;rubbing&quot; emphasized that this alcohol was not intended for consumption. Nevertheless it was well documented as a surrogate alcohol as early as 1925.

Alcohol was already widely used as a liniment for massage. There was no standard formula for rubbing alcohol, which was sometimes perfumed with additives such as wintergreen oil (methyl salicylate).

== Properties ==
All rubbing alcohols are volatile and flammable. Ethyl rubbing alcohol has an extremely bitter taste from additives. The specific gravity of Formula 23-H is between 0.8691 and 0.8771 at .

Isopropyl rubbing alcohols contain from 50% to 99% by volume of isopropyl alcohol, the remainder consisting of water. Boiling points vary with the proportion of isopropyl alcohol from ; likewise, freezing points vary from . Surgical spirit BP boils at .

Naturally colorless, products may contain color additives. They may also contain medically-inactive additives for fragrance, such as wintergreen oil (methyl salicylate), or for other purposes.

== US legislation ==

To protect alcohol tax revenue in the United States, all preparations classified as &quot;Rubbing Alcohols&quot; (defined as those containing ethanol) must have poisonous additives to limit human consumption in accordance with the requirements of the US Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, using Formula 23-H (8 parts by volume of acetone, 1.5 parts by volume of methyl isobutyl ketone, and 100 parts by volume of ethyl alcohol). It contains 87.5–91% by volume of absolute ethyl alcohol. The rest consists of water and the denaturants, with or without color additives, and perfume oils. Rubbing alcohol contains in each 100 ml more than 355 mg of sucrose octaacetate or more than 1.40 mg of denatonium benzoate. The preparation may be colored with one or more color additives. A suitable stabilizer may also be added.

== Warnings ==

Product labels for rubbing alcohol include a number of hazard symbols about the chemical, including the flammability hazards and its intended use only as a topical antiseptic and not for internal wounds or consumption. It should be used in a well-ventilated area due to inhalation hazards. Poisoning can occur from ingestion, inhalation, absorption, or consumption of rubbing alcohol.

<text>Venice Marco Polo Airport is the international airport of Venice, Italy. It is located on the mainland near the village of Tessera, a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; of Venice located about east of Mestre (on the mainland) and around the same distance north of Venice proper. Due to the importance of Venice as a leisure destination, it features flights to many European metropolitan areas as well as some partly seasonal long-haul routes to the United States, Canada, South Korea and the Middle East. The airport handled 11,184,608 passengers in 2018, making it the fourth-busiest airport in Italy. The airport is named after Marco Polo and serves as a base for Volotea, Ryanair, Wizz Air and easyJet.

Another airport located in the Venice area, Treviso Airport, is sometimes unofficially labelled &quot;Venice – Treviso&quot; and serves low-cost airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air.

== Overview ==
A modern terminal was opened in 2002, but it is already at full capacity. The airport is managed by SAVE S.p.A., a company partially owned by local authorities that also controls the smaller Treviso Airport, dedicated to low-cost carriers. The airport was named after the Venetian traveller Marco Polo.

== Terminal ==

The airport terminal has three floors: the ground floor for arrivals and the second floor for departures. The departure area has 70 check-in desks and has two airside lounges. The &quot;Tintoretto Lounge&quot; is for SkyTeam passengers and the &quot;Marco Polo Room&quot; is for all other passengers. The third floor of the terminal has offices for the operating company and airlines. The departure floor has separate areas for Schengen and non-Schengen flights.

==Airlines and destinations==

The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Venice:
==Statistics==
==Ground transportation==
The mainland airport has scheduled bus connections to the nearby railway stations of Venice Mestre and Piazzale Roma. The airport is also directly connected to several destinations in the lagoon by public transit Alilaguna water shuttle services (Blue, Red and Orange lines); by the express Gold Line to Piazza San Marco or by water taxi. From the airport it is possible to reach:

* Venice Piazzale Roma by ATVO (provincial company) buses and by ACTV (city company) buses (route 5 &quot;aerobus&quot;);
* Venice, Lido and Murano by Alilaguna (private company) motorboats;
* Mestre, the mainland and Venice Mestre railway station, providing connections to Milan, Padua, Trieste, Verona and the rest of Italy, by ACTV buses (route 15 and 45) and ATVO buses;
* regional destinations (Treviso, Padua, beaches ...) by ATVO buses and by Busitalia Sita Nord buses (national company).

A rail link which will connect the airport to Venice Mestre via the Venice–Trieste railway is currently under construction and is expected to come into service in 2025.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 6 March 1967, a Short Brothers SC.7 Skyvan 2–102, operated by Soc. Aeralpi, crashed while attempting to land in bad weather, crashing into the lagoon. All 3 on board survived.
* On 14 September 1993, an Italian Air Force Piaggio PD.808 crashed while attempting to land in bad weather, killing all 3 on board.

<text>Vlissingen (; ) is a municipality and a city in the southwestern Netherlands on the island of Walcheren. With its strategic location between the Scheldt river and the North Sea, Vlissingen has been an important harbour for centuries. It was granted city rights in 1315. In the 17th century the roadstead of Vlissingen was a main harbour for ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). It is also known as the birthplace of Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter.

Vlissingen is mainly noted for the yards on the Scheldt where most of the ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy (&quot;Koninklijke Marine&quot;) are built.

== Geography ==
The municipality of Vlissingen consists of the following places:
* City: Vlissingen
* Villages: Oost-Souburg, Ritthem, and West-Souburg
* Hamlet: Groot-Abeele

==History==

The fishermen&#x27;s hamlet that came into existence at the estuary of the Schelde around AD 620 has grown over its 1,400-year history into the third-most important port of the Netherlands. The Counts of Holland, Flanders, and Zeeland had the first harbours dug. Over the centuries, Vlissingen developed into a hub for fishing, especially the herring fishery, commerce, privateering and the slave trade. 

The first reliable records of Old Vlissengen date from a charter of 1247, when the town already had a church and an infirmary; another in 1264 mentions a &quot;steenhuus&quot; or castle, the foundations of which were uncovered during the construction of a new town hall in 1965. In 1294, the town was purchased by Floris V, Count of Holland, who recognised the strategic and economic potential of its location and began its development. The port facilities were further extended in the mid-15th century, financed by a local monopoly in the herring trade. In the mid-16th century, the town fell into poverty due to the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the Dutch revolt against Spanish occupation, and particularly owing to the punitive taxes imposed by the Duke of Alba. In April 1572, the townspeople staged a successful uprising, expelling the Flemish garrison, firing at ships bringing reinforcements and hanging a Spanish nobleman in front of the town hall. Under the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585, English garrisons were stationed here and at Brill to keep these ports out of Spanish hands. The towns were sold back to the Dutch in 1616. 

During the heyday of the Dutch Golden Age, ships from Vlissingen set sail for the various outposts of the Dutch colonial empire and contributed to the world power of The Seven Provinces.

The history of Vlissingen was also marked by invasion, oppression and bombardments. Because of its strategic position at the mouth of the Schelde, the most important passageway to Antwerp, it has attracted the interest, at one time or another, of the British, the French, the Germans and the Spanish. Floods have also been a constant threat. Vlissingen declined during the 18th century. The Napoleonic Wars were particularly disastrous. After 1870, the economy revived after the construction of new docks and the Walcheren canal, the arrival of the railway and the establishment of the shipyard called De Schelde. The Second World War interrupted this growth. The city was heavily damaged by shelling and inundation but was captured and liberated by British Commandos of 4th Special Service Brigade on 3 November 1944.

The city was rebuilt after the war. In the 1960s, the seaport and industrial area of Vlissingen-Oost developed and flourished. Now this area is the economic driving force behind central Zeeland, generating many thousands of jobs. Nowadays approx. 50,000 ships annually from all corners of the world pass through the Schelde.

==Name==

===Etymology===
The derivation of the name Vlissingen is unclear, though most scholars relate the name to the word &quot;fles&quot; (&quot;bottle&quot;) in one way or another.

According to one story, when saint Willibrord landed in Vlissingen with a bottle in the 7th century, he shared its contents with the beggars he found there while trying to convert them. A miracle occurred, typical of hagiography, when the contents of the bottle did not diminish. When the bishop realised the beggars did not want to listen to his words, he gave them his bottle. After that, he supposedly called the city &quot;Flessinghe&quot;.

Another source states that the name had its origins in an old ferry-service house, on which a bottle was attached by way of a sign. The monk Jacob van Dreischor, who visited the city in 967, then apparently called the ferry-house &quot;het veer aan de Flesse&quot; (&quot;the ferry at the Bottle&quot;). Because many cities in the region later received the appendix &quot;-inge&quot;, the name, according to this etymology, evolved to &quot;Vles-inge&quot;.

According to another source, the name was derived from the Danish word &quot;Vles&quot;, which means &quot;tides&quot;.

The eastern cape of Novaya Zemlya, Cape Flissingsky was named after the city in 1596 by Willem Barentsz.

===Historical English name &quot;Flushing&quot;===
Vlissingen was historically called &quot;Flushing&quot; in English. In the 17th century, Vlissingen was important enough for English speakers that it had acquired an anglicised name. For example, Samuel Pepys referred to the town as &quot;Flushing&quot; in his diaries. In 1673, Sir William Temple referred to Vlissingen as &quot;Flushing&quot; once and &quot;Flussingue&quot; twice in his book about the Netherlands. Some English writers in the Netherlands also used the Dutch name.

The American settlement of Flushing, originally a Dutch colonial village founded in 1645 and now part of Queens, New York City, was first called Vlissingen after the town in the Netherlands. The English settlers who also came to live in the village shortened the name to &quot;Vlissing&quot; by 1657 and then began to call it by its English name &quot;Flushing.&quot; The Anglicisation of &quot;Vlissingen&quot; into &quot;Flushing&quot; did not occur after the conquest of New Netherland, but in England well before then. This village was the site of the Flushing Remonstrance.

The village of Flushing in Cornwall was also named after Vlissingen. Originally named Nankersey, the village was given its name by Dutch engineers from Vlissingen in the Netherlands who built the three main quays in the village. Michigan and Ohio in the US have villages called Flushing as well.

==Climate==
Vlissingen has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) that is milder than the rest of the Netherlands due to its more southern location on the coast. It is approximately 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer annually than Groningen in the northeast. It is also one of the sunniest cities in the Netherlands, receiving approximately 180 more sunshine hours than Maastricht in the southeast. Its all-time record is set on 27 July 2018 and on 21 February 1956.

<text>Legal tender is a form of money that courts of law are required to recognize as satisfactory payment in court for any monetary debt. Each jurisdiction determines what is legal tender, but essentially it is anything which, when offered (&quot;tendered&quot;) in payment of a debt, extinguishes the debt. There is no obligation on the creditor to accept the tendered payment, but the act of tendering the payment in legal tender discharges the debt.

It is generally only mandatory to recognize the payment of legal tender in the discharge of a monetary debt from a debtor to a creditor. Sellers offering to enter into contractual relationship, such as a contract for the sale of goods, do not need to accept legal tender and may instead contractually require payment using electronic methods, foreign currencies or any other legally recognized object of value. 

Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender in many countries, but personal checks, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are usually not. Some jurisdictions may include a specific foreign currency as legal tender, at times as its exclusive legal tender or concurrently with its domestic currency.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;legal tender&quot; is from Middle French &quot;tendre&quot; (verb form), meaning &quot;to offer&quot;. The &quot;Latin&quot; root is &quot;tendere&quot; (to stretch out), and the sense of &quot;tender&quot; as an &quot;offer&quot; is related to the etymology of the English word &quot;extend&quot; (to hold outward).

==Withdrawal and replacement==

Demonetization is the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender. It occurs whenever there is a change of national currency: The current form or forms of money is or are pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with new currency. The opposite of demonetization is remonetization, in which a form of payment is restored as legal tender. Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency replace them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one. Examples of this are:
* During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, 500- and 1000-guilder banknotes were demonetized, and after liberation, 100-guilder notes were also demonetized. Anne Frank in her diary entry on 19 March 1943 notes:Piet Lieftinck&#x27;s measure of demonetizing 100-guilder notes was aimed at war profiteers.
* On 6 October 1944, the recently repatriated Belgian government demonetized banknotes greater than 100 francs. People having 100 francs were allowed to exchange up to 2000 francs per household for new banknotes. Banks added withdrawal limits and current accounts were frozen.
* The Government of Ceylon passed the Prevention of the Avoidance of Income Tax Act on 26 October 1970, demonetized all currency notes of the denominations of Rupees 50 and 100, bearing a date prior to that of the demonetization.
* The United Kingdom adopted decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p – 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (½p, 1p, 2p – equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d and 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2½p), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee&#x27;s large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed by exchanging them for legal tender currency with no time limits; but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value.
* As part of their economic warfare operations during the Angolan Civil War, South African intelligence produced and disseminated counterfeit Angolan currency. In late 1980, counterfeit 100 Kwanza notes began to appear in Huambo and spread to other large cities in the northwest. On February 4, 1981 at a commemoration of 20 years of struggle by the MPLA, Jose Eduardo dos Santos announced that the old notes would be withdrawn and exchanged with new notes. The old notes featured the previous president, Agostinho Neto, while the new notes showed him and dos Santos in profile, which became a standard feature on other designations.
* The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s.
* The successor states of Yugoslavia replacing the Yugoslav dinar in the 1990s and 2000s.
* Currencies used in the Eurozone which were replaced by the euro were then not legal tender, but all banknotes and coins were redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes and coins, there is no time limit).
* India demonetized its 500 and 1000 rupee notes on 8 November 2016. This action affected 86 per cent of all cash in circulation. The demonetization action was intended to curb counterfeit notes and black money, the hoarding of unaccounted cash, and sponsorship of terrorism, but also led to long queues from bank runs, leaving more than 30 people dead. The old notes were replaced by new 500 and 2000 rupee notes.
* The Philippines has ceased 2 peso and 50 centavo coins of the Flora and Fauna Series in 2000, due to over minting of the coins of the BSP Series that has not included the 2 peso and 50 centavo coins of that series.

Individual coins or banknotes can be demonetized and cease to be legal tender (for example, the pre-decimal United Kingdom farthing or the Bank of England 1 pound note), but the Bank of England does redeem all Bank of England banknotes by exchanging them for legal tender currency at its counters in London (or by post) regardless of how old they are. Banknotes issued by retail banks in the UK (Scotland and Northern Ireland) are not legal tender, but one of the criteria for legal protection under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act is that banknotes must be payable on demand, therefore withdrawn notes remain a liability of the issuing bank without any time limits.

In the case of the euro, coins and banknotes of former national currencies were in some cases considered legal tender from 1 January 1999 until various dates in 2002. Most countries continued to exchange pre-euro notes and coins for a period of time; only Ireland continues to do so. Legally, those coins and banknotes were considered non-decimal sub-divisions of the euro.

When the so-called &quot;Swiss&quot; dinar ceased to be legal tender in Iraq, it still circulated in the northern Kurdish regions. Despite lacking government backing, it had a stable market value for more than a decade.

This is also true of the paper money issued by the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. The Confederate currency became worthless by its own terms after the war, since it could only be redeemed a stated number of years after a peace treaty was signed between the Confederacy and the United States (which never happened, as the Confederacy was defeated and dissolved).

During World War II the United States printed a series of Hawaii overprint notes as an emergency issue after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The intent of the overprints was to easily distinguish United States dollars captured by the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces in the event of an invasion of Hawaii (which never happened) and render the notes worthless via demonetization.

Demonetization is currently prohibited in the United States, and the Coinage Act of 1965 applies to all US coins and currency regardless of age. The closest historical equivalent in the US, other than Confederate money, was from 1933 to 1974, when the government banned most private ownership of gold bullion, including gold coins held for non-numismatic purposes. Now, however, even surviving pre-1933 gold coins are legal tender under the 1964 act.

===Withdrawal from circulation===
Banknotes and coins may be withdrawn from circulation but remain legal tender. United States banknotes issued at any date remain legal tender even after they are withdrawn from circulation. Canadian 1- and 2-dollar bills remain legal tender even if they have been withdrawn and replaced by coins, but Canadian $1,000 bills remain legal tender even if they are removed from circulation as they arrive at a bank. However, Bank of England notes that are withdrawn from circulation generally cease to be legal tender but remain redeemable for current currency at the Bank of England itself or by post. All paper and polymer issues of New Zealand banknotes issued from 1967 onwards (and 1- and 2-dollar notes until 1993) are still legal tender; however, 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins are no longer used in New Zealand.

===Cashless society===

A cashless society is an economic state whereby financial transactions are not conducted with money in the form of physical banknotes or coins. Cashless societies have existed, based on barter and other methods of exchange. In modern usage, the term usually refers to financial transactions conducted by transfer of digital information (usually an electronic representation of money) between the transacting parties.

==Commemorative issues==
Sometimes currency issues such as commemorative coins or transfer bills may be issued that are not intended for public circulation but are nonetheless legal tender. An example of such currency is Maundy money. Some currency issuers, particularly the Scottish banks, issue special commemorative banknotes which are intended for ordinary circulation (though no Scottish banknotes nor notes from Northern Ireland are legal tender in the United Kingdom). As well, some standard coins are minted on higher-quality dies as uncirculated versions of the coin, for collectors to purchase at a premium; these coins are nevertheless legal tender. Some countries issue precious-metal coins which have a currency value indicated on them which is far below the value of the metal the coin contains: these coins are known as &quot;non-circulating legal tender&quot; or &quot;NCLT&quot;.

==Status by country==

===Australia===
The Australian dollar, comprising notes and coins, is legal tender in Australia. Australian notes are legal tender by virtue of the &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; (Cth) s 36(1), without an amount limit. The &quot;Currency Act 1965&quot; (Cth) similarly provides that Australian coins intended for general circulation are also legal tender, but only for the following amounts:
* Not exceeding 20c if 1c and/or 2c coins are offered,
* Not exceeding $5 if any of 5c, 10c, 20c and 50c coins are offered,
* Not exceeding 10 times the face value if the coins offered are greater than 50c up to and including $10,
* To any value for coins of other denominations above $10.

The 1c and 2c coins were withdrawn from circulation from February 1992 but remain legal tender.

Although the &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; and the &quot;Currency Act 1965&quot; establishes that Australian banknotes and coins have legal tender status, Australian banknotes and coins do not necessarily have to be used in transactions and refusal to accept payment in legal tender is not unlawful. A provider of goods or services is at liberty to set the commercial terms upon which payment will take place before the contract for supply of the goods or services is entered into. If a provider of goods or services specifies other means of payment prior to the contract, then there is usually no obligation for legal tender to be accepted as payment. This is the case even when an existing debt is involved. However, refusal to accept legal tender in payment of an existing debt, where no other means of payment/settlement has been specified in advance, conceivably could have consequences in legal proceedings.

Australia Post prohibits the sending of coins or banknotes, of any country, except via registered post.

====History====
In 1901, notes in circulation in Australia consisted of bank notes payable in gold coin and issued by the trading banks, and Queensland Treasury notes. Bank notes circulated in all states except Queensland, but were not legal tender except for a brief period in 1893 in New South Wales. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue and other provisions for the protection of the public. Queensland Treasury notes were issued by the Queensland Government and were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the Commonwealth Parliament passed the &quot;Australian Notes Act 1910&quot; and the &quot;Bank Notes Tax Act 1910&quot;. The &quot;Australian Notes Act 1910&quot; prohibited the circulation of state notes as money, and the &quot;Bank Notes Tax Act 1910&quot; imposed a tax of 10%, per annum, on &quot;all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth after the commencement of this Act, and not redeemed&quot;. These Acts effectively put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. &quot;The Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; expressly prohibits persons and states from issuing &quot;a bill or note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation&quot;.

===Canada===
In general, Canadian dollar banknotes issued by the Bank of Canada and coins issued under the authority of the Royal Canadian Mint Act are legal tender in Canada. However, commercial transactions may legally be settled in any manner agreed by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, convenience stores may refuse $100 bank notes if they feel that would put them at risk of being counterfeit victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.

Under the &quot;Currency Act&quot;, there are limits to the value of a transaction for which only coins are used. A payment in coins is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:

# $40 if the denomination is $2 to $10,
# $25 if the denomination is $1,
# $10 if the denomination is 10c to $1,
# $5 if the denomination is 5c, and
# 25c if the denomination is 1c.

In the case of coins of a denomination greater than $10, a payment is a legal tender for no more than the value of a single coin of that denomination. Where more than one amount is payable by one person to another on the same day under one or more obligations, the total of those amounts is deemed to be one amount due and payable on that day.

===China===
In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the official currency renminbi serves as the unlimited legal tender for all transactions. It is illegal for any public institution or individual to refuse the currency when settling public or private debts.

===El Salvador===
In June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, after the Legislative Assembly had voted 62–22 to pass a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such.

===Eurozone===
Euro coins and banknotes became legal tender in most countries of the Eurozone on 1 January 2002. Although one side of the coins is used for different national marks for each country, all coins and all banknotes are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Although some eurozone countries do not put 1 cent and 2 cent coins into general circulation (prices in those countries are by general understanding always rounded to whole multiples of 5 cent), 1 cent and 2 cent coins from other eurozone countries remain legal tender in those countries.

Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 limits the number of coins that can be offered for payment to fifty. Governments that issue the coins must establish the euro as the only legal tender. Due to variations on the legislative meaning of legal tender in various member states and the ability of contract law to overrule the status of legal tender, it is possible for merchants to choose to refuse to accept euro banknotes and coins within specific countries within the Eurozone. For example, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Finland, and Ireland have &quot;de jure&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot; removed the use of 1 cent and 2 cent coins and adopted cash rounding to the nearest multiple of 5 cents. National laws may also impose restrictions as to maximal amounts that can be settled by coins or notes.

Kosovo and Montenegro, which are not members of the European Union and the Eurozone and do not have a formal monetary agreement with the EU, unilaterally adopted the euro in 2002 as their &quot;de facto&quot; domestic currency to ensure monetary stability and to continue to avoid the high/hyper inflation seen in preceding decades: this means that the euro is not a legal tender there, however it is treated as such by the government and the people.

===France===
Legal tender was enacted the first time for gold and silver coins in the French Penal Code of 1807 (art. 475, 11°). In 1870, legal tender was extended to all notes of the Banque de France. Anyone refusing such coins for their whole value would be prosecuted (French Penal Code art. R. 642–3).

===Republic of Ireland===

According to the Economic and Monetary Union Act 1998 of the Republic of Ireland, which replaced the legal tender provisions that had been re-enacted in Irish legislation from previous British enactments, &quot;No person, other than the Central Bank of Ireland and such persons as may be designated by the Minister by order, shall be obliged to accept more than 50 coins denominated in euro or in cent in any single transaction.&quot;

====History====
The Decimal Currency Act, 1970 governed legal tender prior to the adoption of the euro and laid down the analogous provisions as in United Kingdom legislation (all inherited from previous UK law), namely: coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding £10, coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding £5, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence.

===Republic of India===
The Indian rupee is the &quot;de facto&quot; legal tender currency in India. The Indian rupee is also legal tender in Nepal and Bhutan, but the Nepalese rupee and Bhutanese ngultrum are not legal tender in India. Both the Nepalese rupee and Bhutanese ngultrum are pegged with the Indian rupee.

The Indian rupee used to be an official currency of several other countries, including the Straits Settlements (now Singapore and parts of Malaysia), Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the Trucial States (now the UAE), Oman, Aden Colony and Aden Protectorate (now parts of Yemen), British Somaliland, British East Africa, and Zanzibar.

In 1837, the Indian rupee was made the sole official currency of the Straits Settlements, as it was administered as a part of India. In 1845, the British replaced the Indian rupee with the Straits dollar after administration of the Straits Settlements separated from India earlier in that same year.
After partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Pakistani rupee came into existence, initially using Indian coins and Indian currency notes simply overstamped with the word &quot;Pakistan&quot;. New coins and banknotes were issued in 1948.

The Gulf rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf rupee (XPGR), was introduced by the Government of India as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act of 1 May 1959. This creation of a separate currency was an attempt to reduce the strain put on India&#x27;s foreign reserves by gold smuggling.

Kuwait and Bahrain eventually replaced the Gulf rupee with their own currencies (the Kuwaiti dinar and the Bahraini dinar) after gaining independence from Britain in 1961 and 1965, respectively.

On 6 June 1966, India devalued the rupee. To avoid following this devaluation, several of the states using the rupee adopted their own currencies. Qatar and most of the Trucial States adopted the Qatar and Dubai riyal, whilst Abu Dhabi adopted the Bahraini dinar. Only Oman continued to use the Gulf rupee until 1970, with the government backing the currency at its old peg to the pound. Oman later replaced the Gulf rupee with its own rial in 1970.

On 8 November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that existing INR 500 and INR 1000 banknotes would no longer be accepted as legal tender with a view to curb counterfeiting, tax evasion and the parallel economy. The Reserve Bank of India outlined a scheme for holders of such banknotes to either deposit them into their bank accounts for full, unlimited value, or to exchange the banknotes for new, subject to a cap.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has a complex history of legal tender. English law applied, as applicable to local circumstances, either from 6 January 1840 (when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand) or from 14 January 1840 (when Captain Hobson (of the Royal Navy) was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand). The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. The (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as legal tender in New Zealand. (Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank, established in 1934, did not have the right to issue coins as legal tender. Coins had to be issued by the Minister of Finance.)

The history of bank notes in New Zealand was considerably more complex. In 1840 the Union Bank of Australia started issuing bank notes under provisions of British law but these were not automatically legal tender.

In 1844, ordinances were passed by NZ Parliament making the Union Bank banknotes legal tender and authorizing the government to issue debentures in small denominations, thus creating two sets of legal tender. These debentures were circulated but were traded at a discount to their face value because of distrust of the colonial government amongst the settler population. In 1845 the British Colonial office disallowed the Ordinance, namely the Debentures Act 1844 (NZ), and the debentures were recalled, not without first causing a panic among holders.

In 1847, the Colonial Bank of Issue became the only issuer of legal tender. In 1856, however, the Colonial Bank of Issue was disbanded; and through the Paper Currency Act 1856 the Union Bank was confirmed once again as an issuer of legal tender. The Act also authorized the Oriental Bank to issue legal tender - but this bank ceased operations in 1861.

Between 1861 and 1874, a number of other banks including the Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of New South Wales, the National Bank of New Zealand and the Colonial Bank of New Zealand were created by Acts of Parliament and authorized to issue bank-notes backed by gold, however these notes were not legal tender.

The 1893 Bank Note Issue Act allowed the government to declare a bank&#x27;s right to issue legal tender. This enabled the government to make such a declaration to assist the Bank of New Zealand when in 1895 the bank encountered financial difficulties that could have led to its failure.

In 1914, the Banking Amendment Act gave legal-tender status to bank notes from any issuer and removed the requirement that banks authorized to issue bank notes must redeem them on demand for gold (the gold standard).

In 1933, the Coinage Act authorized a specific New Zealand coinage and removed legal-tender status from British coins. In the same year the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was established. The bank was given a monopoly on the issue of legal tender. The Reserve Bank also provided a mechanism through which the other issuers of legal tender could phase out their bank notes. These banknotes were convertible into British legal tender on demand at the Reserve Bank and remained so until the 1938 Sterling Exchange Suspension Notice that suspended provisions of a 1936 amendment of the 1933 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act.

In 1964, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act re-stated that only notes issued by the Reserve Bank were legal tender. The Act also ended the right of individuals to redeem their bank notes for coin, effectively ending the distinction between coin and notes in New Zealand. The Act came into force in 1967, establishing as legal tender all New Zealand dollar five-dollar banknotes and greater, all decimal coins, the pre-decimal sixpence, the shilling, and the florin. Also passed in 1964 was the Decimal Currency Act, which created the basis for a decimal currency, introduced in 1967.

, banknotes were legal tender for all payments, and $1 and $2 coins were legal tender for payments up to $100, and 10c, 20c, and 50c silver coins were legal tender for payments up to $5. These older-style silver coins were legal tender until October 2006, after which only the new 10c, 20c and 50c coins, introduced in August 2006, remained legal.

===Norway===
The Norwegian krone (NOK) is legal tender in Norway according to the Central Bank () of 24 May 1985. However, no-one is obliged to accept more than 25 coins of each denomination (of which currently 1, 5, 10 and 20 NOK denominations are in common circulation).

===Singapore and Brunei===
Singapore and Brunei have a Currency Interchangeability Agreement since 12 June 1967. Under the agreement, Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar are exchangeable at par without charge in both countries. As such, the currency of one country is accepted in the other country as &quot;customary tender&quot;.

===Switzerland and Liechtenstein===
The Swiss franc is the only legal tender in Switzerland. Any payment consisting of up to 100 Swiss coins is legal tender; banknotes are legal tender for any amount.

The sixth series of Swiss bank notes from 1976, recalled by the National Bank in 2000 and the eighth series from the 1990s which was withdrawn in 2021, are both no longer legal tender, but banknotes from both series can be exchanged for current notes indefinitely at branches of the Swiss National Bank or at cantonal banks.

The Swiss franc is also the legal tender of the Principality of Liechtenstein, which is in a customs union with Switzerland.

The Swiss franc is also the currency used for administrative and accounting purposes by most of the numerous international organisations that are headquartered in Switzerland.

===Taiwan===
The New Taiwan dollar issued by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is legal tender for all payments within the territory of the Republic of China, Taiwan. However, since 2007, candidates to become civil servants in elections in the Republic of China may no longer pay any deposit in coinage.

===Thailand===

Series 2 banknotes first issued in 1925 during the reign of Rama VI and continuing into the reign of Rama VII added the legend: 
&quot;Promise to pay&quot; (silver to) &quot;bearer on demand in&quot; (silver) &quot;currency of Siam&quot;;
 later changed in 1928 to be in line with The Currency Act, B.E. 2471 to:

&quot;This note is legal tender&quot; (literal translation, &quot;silver in payment of debt&quot;) &quot;according to law&quot;.
 The front has a guilloche design with twelve rays, and the back, depictions of the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. These were printed in 6 denominations – 1, 5, 10, 20,100 and 1000 baht – in two types printed by De La Rue of London, England.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK legal tender specifically relates to the settlement of debts: a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if they pay the exact amount (change cannot be demanded) into court in legal tender.

Legal tender is solely for the guaranteed settlement of debts, and does not imply a right to pay with cash in other contexts. There is a misconception that somebody due to be paid a certain amount of money—such as a shopkeeper—must accept legal tender if proffered for payment; in reality the payee may choose to refuse or accept any specific type of payment, whether legal tender or not. As a specific instance, following the outbreak in 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic, many shops chose not to accept any form of cash due to the risk of infection, accepting payment cards only.

Throughout the United Kingdom, Royal Mint coins valued £1, £2, and £5 sterling are legal tender in unlimited amounts. Twenty pence pieces and fifty pence pieces are legal tender in amounts up to £10; five pence pieces and ten pence pieces are legal tender in amounts up to £5; and pennies and two pence coins are legal tender in amounts up to 20 pence. In accordance with the Coinage Act 1971, gold sovereigns are also legal tender for any amount. Although it is not specifically mentioned on them, the face values of gold coins are 50p; £1; £2; and £5, a mere fraction of their worth as bullion. Five pound coins, although legal tender, are intended as souvenirs and are almost never seen in circulation.

Current Bank of England notes are legal tender in England and Wales and are issued in the denominations of £5, £10, £20 and £50. Banknotes can always be redeemed at the Bank of England even if discontinued.

To meet the legal definition of legal tender, the exact amount due must be tendered; no change can be demanded.

Maundy money is legal tender but may not be accepted by retailers and is worth much more than face value due to its rarity value and silver content.

In a 1976 case, &quot; Miliangos v George Frank Ltd&quot;, the House of Lords established that the English courts could order debts to be paid in currencies other than sterling under certain circumstances, overturning two centuries of precedent.

====Scotland and Northern Ireland====
Royal Mint coins are legal tender in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but no banknotes are. Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes are widely accepted but are not legal tender anywhere in the UK.

====History====
In the 19th century, gold coins were legal tender to any amount, but silver coins were not legal tender for sums over £2 nor bronze for sums over 1 shilling. This provision was retained in revised form at the introduction of decimal currency, and the Coinage Act 1971 laid down that coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, non-bronze coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence.

===United States===
Before the American Civil War (1861–1865), silver coins were legal tender only up to the sum of $5. Before 1853, when U.S. silver coins were reduced in weight 7%, coins had exactly their value in metal (from 1830 to 1852). Two silver 50 cent coins had exactly $1 worth of silver. A gold U.S. dollar of 1849 had $1 worth of gold. With the flood of gold coming out of the California mines in the early 1850s, the price of silver rose (gold went down). Thus, 50 cent coins of 1840 to 1852 were worth 53 cents if melted down. The government could increase the value of the gold coins (expensive) or reduce the size of all U.S. silver coins. With the reduction of 1853, a 50-cent coin now had only 48 cents of silver. This is the reason for the $5 limit of silver coins as legal tender; paying somebody $100 in the new silver coins would be giving them $96 worth of silver. Most people preferred bank check or gold coins for large purchases.

During the early part of the war, the federal government first issued United States Notes (inheriting the nickname greenback notes from the contemporary new Demand Notes), which were not redeemable in gold and silver coins but could be used to pay &quot;all dues&quot; to the federal government. Since land purchases and duties on imports were payable only in gold or the new Demand Notes, the Demand Notes were bought by importers and land speculators for about 97 cents on the gold dollar and never lost value. 1862 greenbacks (Legal Tender Notes) at first traded for 97 cents on the dollar but gained/lost value depending on fortunes of the Union army. The value of Legal Tender Greenbacks swung wildly but trading was from 85 to 33 cents on the gold dollar.

This resulted in a situation in which the greenback &quot;Legal Tender&quot; notes of 1862 were fiat, and so gold and silver were held, and paper circulated at a discount because of Gresham&#x27;s law. The 1861 Demand Notes were a huge success but robbed the customs house of much needed gold coin (interest on most bonds back then was paid in gold). A money-strapped Congress, which had to pay for the war, eventually adopted the Legal Tender Act of 1862, issuing United States Notes backed only by treasury securities and compelled the people to accept the new notes at a discount; prices rose except for those who had gold and/or silver coins.

Following the Civil War, paper currency was disputed as to whether it must be accepted as payment. In 1869, Hepburn v. Griswold found that Henry Griswold would not have to accept paper currency because it could not truly be &quot;legal tender&quot; and was unconstitutional as a legally enforceable means to pay debts. This led to the Legal Tender Cases in 1870, which overturned the previous ruling and established the paper currency as constitutional and proper legal tender that must be accepted in all situations.

With the 1884 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot;, the &quot;Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the right to issue notes to be legal tender for the payment of public and private debt. Legal-tender notes are treasury notes or banknotes that, in the eyes of the law, must be accepted in the payment of debts.&quot; The ruling in the Legal Tender Cases (which include &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot;) led later courts to &quot;support the federal government&#x27;s invalidation of gold clauses in private contracts in the 1930s.&quot;

On the other hand, coins made of gold or silver may not necessarily be legal tender, if they are not fiat money in the jurisdiction where they are proffered as payment. The Coinage Act of 1965 states (in part):
Contrary to common misconception, there is no federal law stating that a private business, a person, or a government organization must accept currency or coins for payment. Private businesses are free to create their own policies on whether they accept cash, unless there is a specific state law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in cents or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores, and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency as a matter of policy or safety.

The principal purpose of that statute is to ensure the nationwide acceptance of U.S. currency, consistent with constitutional language that reserves to Congress the power to create a uniform currency that holds the same value throughout the United States. While the statute provides that U.S. money is legal tender that may be accepted for the payment of debts, it does not require &quot;acceptance&quot; of cash payments, nor does it provide that restrictions cannot be imposed upon the acceptance of cash.

===Venezuela===
On 11 December 2016, Venezuela&#x27;s government announced demonetisation following almost 500% inflation in the country. People of the country were given 3 days to get rid of the 100 Bolivar notes (most widely used currency) post the introduction of new note of higher denominations. As of 15 June 2017, there has been 7 extensions (one per month) of the legal use of the 100 bolivares bill notes. The 100 Bolivar notes were still legal tender as of 30 December 2017.

====Zimbabwe====
Zimbabwe has a multi-currency system that recognizes the Zimbabwean ZiG, the US dollar and the gold (Mosi-oa-Tunya (coin)) as legal tender. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is also issuing the ZiG, a digital token backed by gold, which has also been granted legal tender status.

<doc id="267800" wikidata="Q1367487" url="?curid=267800" title="Tit for tat">
<text>Tit for tat is an English saying meaning &quot;equivalent retaliation&quot;. It is an alteration of &quot; for &quot; &quot;blow for blow&quot;, first recorded in 1558.

It is also a highly effective strategy in game theory. An agent using this strategy will first cooperate, then subsequently replicate an opponent&#x27;s previous action. If the opponent previously was cooperative, the agent is cooperative. If not, the agent is not. This is similar to reciprocal altruism in biology.

==Game theory==
Tit-for-tat has been very successfully used as a strategy for the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. The strategy was first introduced by Anatol Rapoport in Robert Axelrod&#x27;s two tournaments, held around 1980. Notably, it was (on both occasions) both the simplest strategy and the most successful in direct competition. Few have extended the game theoretical approach to other applications such as finance. In that context the tit for tat strategy was shown to be associated to the trend following strategy.

== Implications ==
The success of the tit-for-tat strategy, which is largely cooperative despite that its name emphasizes an adversarial nature, took many by surprise. Arrayed against strategies produced by various teams it won in two competitions. After the first competition, new strategies formulated specifically to combat tit-for-tat failed due to their negative interactions with each other; a successful strategy other than tit-for-tat would have had to be formulated with both tit-for-tat and itself in mind.

This result may help explain how groups of animals, especially human societies, have developed to live in mostly or fully cooperative ways, rather than in the fiercely competitive and aggressive manner one might expect from individuals living in a natural state of constant conflict. This, and particularly its application to human society and politics, is the subject of Robert Axelrod&#x27;s book &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot;.

Moreover, the tit-for-tat strategy has been of beneficial use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict. Research has indicated that when individuals who have been in competition for a period of time no longer trust one another, the most effective competition reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy. Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation, a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members. Therefore, if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation, then cooperation ensues. On the other hand, if the other party competes, then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well. Ultimately, each action by the other member is countered with a matching response, competition with competition and cooperation with cooperation.

In the case of conflict resolution, the tit-for-tat strategy is effective for several reasons: the technique is recognized as &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;, &quot;provocable&quot;, and &quot;forgiving&quot;. Firstly, it is a &quot;clear&quot; and recognizable strategy. Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, it is considered to be &quot;nice&quot; as it begins with cooperation and only defects in response to competition. The strategy is also &quot;provocable&quot; because it provides immediate retaliation for those who compete. Finally, it is &quot;forgiving&quot; as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move.

The implications of the tit-for-tat strategy have been of relevance to conflict research, resolution and many aspects of applied social science.

== Mathematics ==

Take for example the following infinitely repeated prisoners dilemma game:

The tit-for-tat strategy copies what the other player previously chose. If players cooperate by playing strategy (C,C) they cooperate forever.

Cooperation gives the following payoff (where formula_1 is the discount factor):

: formula_2

a geometric series summing to

: formula_3

If a player deviates to defecting (D), then the next round they get punished. Alternate between outcomes where p1 cooperates and p2 deviates, and vice versa.

Deviation gives the following payoff:

: formula_4

a sum of two geometric series that comes to

: formula_5

Expect collaboration if payoff of deviation is no better than cooperation.

: formula_6

Continue cooperating if, formula_7

Continue defecting if, formula_8

== Problems ==
While Axelrod has empirically shown that the strategy is optimal in some cases of direct competition, two agents playing tit for tat remain vulnerable. A one-time, single-bit error in either player&#x27;s interpretation of events can lead to an unending &quot;death spiral&quot;: if one agent defects and the opponent cooperates, then both agents will end up alternating cooperate and defect, yielding a lower payoff than if both agents were to continually cooperate. This situation frequently arises in real world conflicts, ranging from schoolyard fights to civil and regional wars. The reason for these issues is that tit for tat is not a subgame perfect equilibrium, except under knife-edge conditions on the discount rate.
While this sub-game is not directly reachable by two agents playing tit-for-tat strategies, a strategy must be a Nash equilibrium in all sub-games to be sub-game perfect. Further, this sub-game may be reached if any noise is allowed in the agents&#x27; signaling. A sub-game perfect variant of tit for tat known as &quot;contrite tit for tat&quot; may be created by employing a basic reputation mechanism.

Knife-edge is &quot;equilibrium that exists only for exact values of the exogenous variables. If you vary the variables in even the slightest way, knife-edge equilibrium disappear.&quot;

Can be both Nash equilibrium and knife-edge equilibrium. Known as knife-edge equilibrium because the equilibrium &quot;rests precariously on&quot; the exact value.

Example:

Suppose X = 0. There is no profitable deviation from (Down, Left) or from (Up, Right). However, if the value of X deviates by any amount, no matter how small, then the equilibrium no longer stands. It becomes profitable to deviate to up, for example, if X has a value of 0.000001 instead of 0. Thus, the equilibrium is very precarious. In its usage in the Wikipedia article, knife-edge conditions is referring to the fact that very rarely, only when a specific condition is met and, for instance, X, equals a specific value is there an equilibrium.

Tit for two tats could be used to mitigate this problem; see the description below. &quot;Tit for tat with forgiveness&quot; is a similar attempt to escape the death spiral. When the opponent defects, a player employing this strategy will occasionally cooperate on the next move anyway. The exact probability that a player will respond with cooperation depends on the line-up of opponents.

Furthermore, the tit-for-tat strategy is not proved optimal in situations short of total competition. For example, when the parties are friends it may be best for the friendship when a player cooperates at every step despite occasional deviations by the other player. Most situations in the real world are less competitive than the total competition in which the tit-for-tat strategy won its competition.

Tit for tat is very different from grim trigger, in that it is forgiving in nature, as it immediately produces cooperation, should the competitor choose to cooperate. Grim trigger on the other hand is the most unforgiving strategy, in the sense even a single defect would the make the player playing using grim trigger defect for the remainder of the game.

==Tit for two tats==
Tit for two tats is similar to tit for tat, but allows the opponent to defect from the agreed upon strategy twice before the player retaliates.  This aspect makes the player using the tit for tat strategy appear more &quot;forgiving&quot; to the opponent.

In a tit for tat strategy, once an opponent defects, the tit for tat player immediately responds by defecting on the next move. This has the unfortunate consequence of causing two retaliatory strategies to continuously defect against each other resulting in a poor outcome for both players. A tit for two tats player will let the first defection go unchallenged as a means to avoid the &quot;death spiral&quot; of the previous example. If the opponent defects twice in a row, the tit for two tats player will respond by defecting.

This strategy was put forward by Robert Axelrod during his second round of computer simulations at RAND. After analyzing the results of the first experiment, he determined that had a participant entered the tit for two tats strategy it would have emerged with a higher cumulative score than any other program. As a result, he himself entered it with high expectations in the second tournament. Unfortunately, owing to the more aggressive nature of the programs entered in the second round, which were able to take advantage of its highly forgiving nature, tit for two tats did significantly worse (in the game-theory sense) than tit for tat.

==Real-world use==

=== Peer-to-peer file sharing ===
BitTorrent peers use tit-for-tat strategy to optimize their download speed. More specifically, most BitTorrent peers use a variant of tit for two tats which is called &quot;regular unchoking&quot; in BitTorrent terminology. BitTorrent peers have a limited number of upload slots to allocate to other peers. Consequently, when a peer&#x27;s upload bandwidth is saturated, it will use a tit-for-tat strategy. Cooperation is achieved when upload bandwidth is exchanged for download bandwidth. Therefore, when a peer is not uploading in return to our own peer uploading, the BitTorrent program will &quot;choke&quot; the connection with the uncooperative peer and allocate this upload slot to a hopefully more cooperating peer. &quot;Regular unchoking&quot; correlates to always cooperating on the first move in prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. Periodically, a peer will allocate an upload slot to a randomly chosen uncooperative peer (&quot;unchoke&quot;). This is called &quot;optimistic unchoking&quot;. This behavior allows searching for more cooperating peers and gives a second chance to previously non-cooperating peers. The optimal threshold values of this strategy are still the subject of research.

===Explaining reciprocal altruism in animal communities===

Studies in the prosocial behaviour of animals have led many ethologists and evolutionary psychologists to apply tit-for-tat strategies to explain why altruism evolves in many animal communities. Evolutionary game theory, derived from the mathematical theories formalised by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953), was first devised by Maynard Smith (1972) and explored further in bird behaviour by Robert Hinde. Their application of game theory to the evolution of animal strategies launched an entirely new way of analysing animal behaviour.

Reciprocal altruism works in animal communities where the cost to the benefactor in any transaction of food, mating rights, nesting or territory is less than the gains to the beneficiary. The theory also holds that the act of altruism should be reciprocated if the balance of needs reverse. Mechanisms to identify and punish &quot;cheaters&quot; who fail to reciprocate, in effect a form of tit for tat, are important to regulate reciprocal altruism. For example, tit-for-tat is suggested to be the mechanism of cooperative predator inspection behavior in guppies.

=== War ===
The tit-for-tat inability of either side to back away from conflict, for fear of being perceived as weak or as cooperating with the enemy, has been the cause of many prolonged conflicts throughout history.

However, the tit for tat strategy has also been detected by analysts in the spontaneous non-violent behaviour, called &quot;live and let live&quot; that arose during trench warfare in the First World War. Troops dug in only a few hundred feet from each other would evolve an unspoken understanding. If a sniper killed a soldier on one side, the other expected an equal retaliation. Conversely, if no one was killed for a time, the other side would acknowledge this implied &quot;truce&quot; and act accordingly. This created a &quot;separate peace&quot; between the trenches.

=== The Troubles ===
During The Troubles the term was used to describe increasing eye for an eye behaviour between the Irish Republicans and Ulster Unionists. This can be seen with the Red Lion Pub bombing by the IRA being followed by the McGurk&#x27;s Bar bombing, both targeting civilians. Specifically the attacks of massacres would be structured around the mutual killings of Unionist and Republican communities, both communities being generally uninterested in the violence. This sectarian mentality led to the term &quot;Tit for tat bombings&quot; to enter the common lexicon of Northern Irish society.

<doc id="267801" wikidata="Q1502997" url="?curid=267801" title="Systematic sampling">
<text>In survey methodology, one-dimensional systematic sampling is a statistical method involving the selection of elements from an ordered sampling frame. The most common form of systematic sampling is an equiprobability method. This applies in particular when the sampled units are individuals, households or corporations. When a geographic area is sampled for a spatial analysis, bi-dimensional systematic sampling on an area sampling frame can be applied. 

In one-dimensional systematic sampling, progression through the list is treated circularly, with a return to the top once the list ends. The sampling starts by selecting an element from the list at random and then every &quot;k&quot;th element in the frame is selected, where &quot;k&quot;, is the sampling interval (sometimes known as the &quot;skip&quot;): this is calculated as:

:formula_1

where &quot;n&quot; is the sample size, and &quot;N&quot; is the population size.

Using this procedure each element in the population has a known and equal probability of selection (also known as epsem). This makes systematic sampling functionally similar to simple random sampling (SRS). However, it is not the same as SRS because not every possible sample of a certain size has an equal chance of being chosen (e.g. samples with at least two elements adjacent to each other will never be chosen by systematic sampling). It is, however, much more efficient (if the variance within a systematic sample is more than the variance of the population).

Systematic sampling is to be applied only if the given population is logically homogeneous, because systematic sample units are uniformly distributed over the population. The researcher must ensure that the chosen sampling interval does not hide a pattern. Any pattern would threaten randomness.

Example: Suppose a supermarket wants to study buying habits of their customers, then using systematic sampling they can choose every 10th or 15th customer entering the supermarket and conduct the study on this sample.

This is random sampling with a system. From the sampling frame, a starting point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter are at regular intervals. For example, suppose you want to sample 8 houses from a street of 120 houses. 120/8=15, so every 15th house is chosen after a random starting point between 1 and 15. If the random starting point is 11, then the houses selected are 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116. As an aside, if every 15th house was a &quot;corner house&quot; then this corner pattern could destroy the randomness of the sample.

If, more frequently, the population is not evenly divisible (suppose you want to sample 8 houses out of 125, where 125/8=15.625), should you take every 15th house or every 16th house? If you take every 16th house, 8*16=128, there is a risk that the last house chosen does not exist. On the other hand, if you take every 15th house, 8*15=120, so the last five houses will never be selected. The random starting point should instead be selected as a non-integer between 0 and 15.625 (inclusive on one endpoint only) to ensure that every house has an equal chance of being selected; the interval should now be non-integral (15.625); and each non-integer selected should be rounded up to the next integer. If the random starting point is 3.6, then the houses selected are 4, 20, 35, 50, 66, 82, 98, and 113, where there are 3 cyclic intervals of 15 and 4 intervals of 16.

To illustrate the danger of systematic skip concealing a pattern, suppose we were to sample a planned neighborhood where each street has ten houses on each block. This places houses No. 1, 10, 11, 20, 21, 30... on block corners; corner blocks may be less valuable, since more of their area is taken up by street front etc. that is unavailable for building purposes. If we then sample every 10th household, our sample will either be made up &quot;only&quot; of corner houses (if we start at 1 or 10) or have &quot;no&quot; corner houses (any other start); either way, it will not be representative.

Systematic sampling may also be used with non-equal selection probabilities. In this case, rather than simply counting through elements of the population and selecting every &quot;k&quot;th unit, we allocate each element a space along a number line according to its selection probability. We then generate a random start from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and move along the number line in steps of 1.

Example: We have a population of 5 units (A to E). We want to give unit A a 20% probability of selection, unit B a 40% probability, and so on up to unit E (100%). Assuming we maintain alphabetical order, we allocate each unit to the following interval:
 A: 0 to 0.2
 B: 0.2 to 0.6 (= 0.2 + 0.4)
 C: 0.6 to 1.2 (= 0.6 + 0.6)
 D: 1.2 to 2.0 (= 1.2 + 0.8)
 E: 2.0 to 3.0 (= 2.0 + 1.0)

If our random start was 0.156, we would first select the unit whose interval contains this number (i.e. A). Next, we would select the interval containing 1.156 (element C), then 2.156 (element E). If instead our random start was 0.350, we would select from points 0.350 (B), 1.350 (D), and 2.350 (E).

<doc id="267803" wikidata="Q1884333" url="?curid=267803" title="Magnetic Scrolls">
<text>Magnetic Scrolls was a British video game developer active between 1984 and 1990. A pioneer of audiovisually elaborate text adventure games, it was one of the largest and most acclaimed interactive fiction developers of the 1980s, and one of the &quot;Big Two&quot; with Infocom according to some.

The company&#x27;s games were known for their complex puzzles, intricate storylines, and immersive gameplay. Games developed by Magnetic Scrolls include The Pawn, The Guild of Thieves, and Jinxter.

==History==
===Formation===
Formed by Anita Sinclair, Ken Gordon and Hugh Steers in 1984, London-based Magnetic Scrolls initially dabbled with development on the Sinclair QL home computer before deciding to take advantage of the emerging Atari ST and Amiga gaming platforms. Having secured a publication deal with Rainbird, a British software label owned by Telecomsoft, they began work producing an ambitious text adventure game that would become &quot;The Pawn&quot;.

During the mid-1980s, the text adventure market was thriving, although only a very few developers exclusively specialised in the genre. The undisputed giants of the genre were Infocom, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who practically redefined the genre by ensuring the interface (or text parser) never provided a barrier between the player and the fictional elements of the game.

Infocom&#x27;s dominance of the text adventure market ensured they had very few rivals in the United States. Adventure International, owned by Scott and Lexis Adams, had been an early competitor of Infocom, but they went out of business long before Infocom had hit their stride. Their only other serious competitor was Sierra On-Line, owned by Ken and Roberta Williams, who specialised in graphical adventure games.

During the early to mid-1980s Level 9 Computing dominated the UK text adventure market. Delta 4 and CRL also produced a number of text adventures that were critical and commercial hits but were never a serious rival to Level 9. Until they were acquired by Activision in 1985, Infocom&#x27;s titles were something of a rarity in the UK, only usually available as expensive imports. Magnetic Scrolls immediately took advantage of this considerable gap in the UK market with their first release, &quot;The Pawn&quot;.

===Early releases===

&quot;The Pawn&quot;, written by Rob Steggles, was released in 1985, on a wide range of 8-bit and 16-bit platforms, to considerable acclaim. One of the game&#x27;s biggest selling points, besides the advanced text parser, engrossing story and exquisite packaging, were the high resolution illustrations that accompanied many of the game&#x27;s locations. Although decidedly antiquated by today&#x27;s standards, at the time they were considered state-of-the-art. The ZX Spectrum version of the game did not include graphics.

In 1987, Magnetic Scrolls released two new games. Steggles returned to write &quot;The Guild of Thieves&quot;, a traditional treasure hunt, while Georgina Sinclair and Michael Bywater wrote the contemporary fantasy of &quot;Jinxter&quot;. Both games met with similar critical acclaim as &quot;The Pawn&quot;.

For their next release, &quot;Corruption&quot; (1988), Magnetic Scrolls decided to experiment with the boundaries of interactive fiction. Once again written by Rob Steggles, with the help of Hugh Steers, the game was a contemporary thriller that explored corporate corruption and greed. &quot;Corruption&quot; abandoned the traditional puzzle-solving, treasure-hunting gameplay of many text adventure games, requiring the player to progress by conversing with characters, collecting evidence and working against the clock in order to beat the game. The game came packaged with a cassette tape containing a series of audio conversations. The player would be prompted to play them at specific points during the story, adding an extra layer of depth to the game.

Released towards the end of 1988 was &quot;Fish!&quot;, a more light-hearted, surreal adventure game, where the player assumed the role of a dimension-jumping goldfish. Written by John Molloy, Pete Kemp, Phil South and edited by Rob Steggles, &quot;Fish!&quot; would prove to be the last of Magnetic Scrolls&#x27; traditional commercial releases.

&quot;Myth&quot; was released in 1989 through Official Secrets, an adventure gaming club set up by Tony Rainbird after he (and Magnetic Scrolls) parted ways with Telecomsoft. Now based in Hertfordshire, Magnetic Scrolls produced this mini-adventure as a freebie that would be given away to those who signed up to join Official Secrets. The gaming club didn&#x27;t last long, however, and was quickly assimilated into Tony Rainbird&#x27;s new Special Reserve company, specialising in mail order computer hardware and software.

===Later years and demise===

&quot;Wonderland&quot; had been in development at Magnetic Scrolls for some time and was finally released by Virgin Mastertronic in 1990. Magnetic Scrolls had devised a brand new interface, christened Magnetic Windows, to take advantage of the Amiga and Atari ST&#x27;s advanced capabilities. Incorporating auto-mapping, icons, help functions and separate, resizable windows for graphics and text, &quot;Wonderland&quot;, written by David Bishop and based on the works of Lewis Carroll, was a deliberate attempt to push the text adventure in a new, hi-tech direction. However, by the time the new interface was ready the traditional text-based genre had already begun to die out as gamers craved more visually elaborate gaming experiences.

In 1988, Magnetic Scrolls began to collaborate with Infocom, Douglas Adams and Michael Bywater on a sequel to The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy. This project was never finished. A playable draft of an early part of the game, along with the personal and commercial circumstances behind its ill-fated development, came briefly to public attention twenty years later.

In 1991, Virgin Interactive released &quot;The Magnetic Scrolls Collection Vol 1&quot;, containing new versions of &quot;The Guild of Thieves&quot;, &quot;Corruption&quot; and &quot;Fish!&quot; that took advantage of the Magnetic Windows engine. A second collection, containing their remaining games, was planned but never completed.

As a consequence of the dying text adventure market, Magnetic Scrolls ceased publishing in 1992. They were acquired by MicroProse later that year. A number of Magnetic Scrolls&#x27; staff went on to help develop a 3D role-playing video game entitled &quot;The Legacy: Realm of Terror&quot;, which was released on the PC to lukewarm reviews, but MicroProse did not capitalise on the Magnetic Scrolls name beyond that. In the late 1990s, Ken Gordon registered the &quot;magneticscrolls.com&quot; domain, which now redirects to the &quot;Strand Games&quot; website.

Two programmers from Magnetic Scrolls, Doug Rabson and Servan Keondjian later formed the company RenderMorphics which produced the highly acclaimed 3D Graphics API Reality Lab. In January 1995 another Magnetic Scrolls programmer, Steve Lacey joined RenderMorphics and in February of the same year Microsoft acquired the company. Reality Lab became the basis for Direct3D. Rabson and Keondjian are now at Qube Software, which they co-founded with Hugh Steers. Lacey remained at Microsoft as the graphics engine lead on Microsoft Flight Simulator. In October 2006, Lacey moved to Google. In 2011, he was killed in a car accident.

John Molloy moved to Florida, US, working on web-based applications, and died in 2018 following an illness. Phil South lives in South Wales, UK, and after many years working Disney Channel UK&#x27;s web presence worked at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School for 7 years. He now works as a freelance writer and blogger and in 2022 published a novel under a pseudonym.

Anita Sinclair is now one of the UK&#x27;s most successful bridge players, winning a number of domestic competitions, and winning a gold medal in China.

=== Reappearance ===
In May 2017 the Strand games initiative emerged. Strand Games was started by Hugh Steers — co-founder and core developer of Magnetic Scrolls — and Stefan Meier of the Magnetic Scrolls Memorial fanpage. It is supported by several members of the original Magnetic Scrolls team, including Anita Sinclair, Ken Gordon, Rob Steggles and Servan Keondjian. The non-profit initiative aims both to preserve the original works of Magnetic Scrolls and to remaster the games for modern devices. With the public appearance of the initiative a first beta version of the remastered classic The Pawn was released. The official release followed in June 2017.

In June 2017 Strand games worked on recovering the source code of their classics from tapes to remaster and re-release them. After the successful recovery of the original source code in a remarkable process, which involved baking the original backup tapes at low temperature in a kitchen oven, the initiative started to remaster The Guild of Thieves from the original source code. In December 2017 the remastered and enhanced game was published. This was followed by a similarly revived edition of Jinxter in 2019.

<text>Ian Clarke (born 16 February 1977) is the original designer and lead developer of Hyphanet.

==Early life==
Clarke grew up in Navan, County Meath, Ireland. He was educated at Dundalk Grammar School and while there, he came first twice in the Senior Chemical, Physical, and Mathematical section of the Young Scientist Exhibition. The first time, in 1993, was with a project entitled &quot;The C Neural Network Construction Kit&quot;. The second time, the following year, was with a project entitled &quot;Mapping Internal Variations in Translucency within a Translucent Object using Beams of Light&quot;.

==Freenet==
In 1995, Clarke left Dundalk to study Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. While at Edinburgh, he became president of the then dormant Artificial Intelligence Society, resulting in its revival. In Clarke&#x27;s final year at Edinburgh, he completed his final year project, entitled &quot;A Distributed, Decentralised Information Storage and Retrieval System&quot;. In July 1999, after receiving a &#x27;B&#x27; grade for his paper, he decided to release it to the Internet and invited volunteers to help implement his design. The resulting free software project became known as Freenet, and attracted significant attention from the mainstream and technology media.

In August 1999, Clarke began his first full-time job as a software developer in the Space Division of Logica plc, a London-based software consulting company. In February 2000, he left Logica to join a small software start-up called Instil Ltd. In August 2000, he left London for Santa Monica, California, where he co-founded Uprizer, Inc. with the intent of commercializing some of his Freenet-related ideas. In January 2001, Uprizer Inc. successfully raised $4 million in Series A round venture funding from investors including Intel Capital.

In March 2001, Clarke published an article describing FairShare, developed in collaboration with Uprizer&#x27;s co-founders, Steven Starr and Rob Kramer. Clarke was concerned that copyright would become increasingly difficult to enforce in the Internet age, the goal of Fairshare was to provide an alternative to copyright as a way to compensate creators.

==Professional career==
In September 2002, after leaving Uprizer, Clarke formed Cematics LLC to explore a variety of new ideas and opportunities. Cematics LLC developed a number of products including Locutus - a P2P search application for the enterprise, WhittleBit - a search engine that learns from user feedback, and 3D17, a web-based collaborative editing tool.

In October 2003, Clarke decided to leave the United States to return to Edinburgh, Scotland. In December 2004, he began work on Dijjer, a distributed P2P web cache, and Indy, a collaborative music discovery system, both in conjunction with ChangeTv, a company founded by his long-time collaborator, Steven Starr, who later brought in Clarke and Oliver Luckett as co-founders. In 2003, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

ChangeTv changed its name to Revver Inc. and unveiled a new website in November 2005 that strove to let creators of short videos earn revenue from their work. Revver was one of several user-created video websites unveiled in late 2005, but was the first such website to financially compensate video creators, and is reminiscent of Fairshare.

In December 2006, Clarke left Revver and moved to Austin, Texas. There, Clarke founded a new company, SenseArray, which is a drop-in ad targeting engine based on a proprietary algorithm developed by Clarke. In October 2009, he released Swarm, a novel approach to distributing computation across multiple computers in a manner largely transparent to the programmer.

In January 2012, Clarke co-founded OneSpot, with the goal of creating &quot;ads that don&#x27;t suck&quot;. Over the next 3 years, he designed a real-time bidding engine capable of consistently outperforming Google Adwords. In March 2012, he open sourced LastCalc, an online calculator he intended to provide an open and more flexible alternative to tools like Google Calculator.

<text>Charles Daly Barnet (October 26, 1913 – September 4, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist, composer, and bandleader.

His major recordings were &quot;Nagasaki&quot;, &quot;Skyliner&quot;, &quot;Cherokee&quot;, &quot;The Wrong Idea&quot;, &quot;Scotch and Soda&quot;, &quot;In a Mizz&quot;, and &quot;Southland Shuffle&quot;.

==Early life==
Barnet was born in New York City, the son of Charline (Daly) and Willard Barnet. His parents divorced when he was two, and he was raised by his mother and her grandparents. His grandfather was Charles Frederick Daly, a vice-president for the New York Central Railroad, banker, and businessman.

Barnet attended boarding schools, both in the New York and Chicago areas. He learned to play piano and saxophone as a child. He often left school to listen to music and to try to gain work as a musician. Although his family wanted him to become a lawyer, he chose to be a musician instead.

==Career==

By sixteen, Barnet had played on tours with Jean Goldkette&#x27;s satellite band and was in New York, where he joined Frank Winegar&#x27;s Pennsylvania Boys on tenor sax. Always restless, by 1931 he had relocated to Hollywood and appeared as a film extra while trying to interest local bandleaders in hot music, which was increasingly unpopular due to the Great Depression. Late in 1932, aged 18, he returned east and persuaded a contact at CBS&#x27; artist bureau to try him out as an orchestra leader.

Barnet began recording in October 1933, during an engagement at New York&#x27;s Park Central Hotel, but was not a great success for most of the 1930s, regularly breaking up his band and changing its style. Early in 1935, he attempted to premiere swing music at New Orleans&#x27; Hotel Roosevelt, where Louisiana&#x27;s colorful Governor Huey Long, disliking the new sound, had the band run out of town by luring them to a bordello, which was then raided.

Barnet arranged with Joe Haymes to take several of his now-jobless sidemen, while he himself went on a lark in Havana, as an escort to well-to-do older women. 1936 saw another swinging Barnet edition, which featured the up-and-coming vocal quartet The Modernaires but quickly faded from the scene.

The height of Barnet&#x27;s popularity—and his first truly permanent band—came between 1939 and 1941, a period that began with his hit version of &quot;Cherokee&quot;, written by Ray Noble and arranged by Billy May. In 1944, Barnet had another big hit with &quot;Skyliner&quot;.

In 1947, he started to switch from swing music to bebop. During his swing period, his band included Buddy DeFranco, Neal Hefti, Lena Horne, Barney Kessel, Dodo Marmorosa, Oscar Pettiford, Wes Dean, and Art House, while later versions of the band included Maynard Ferguson, Doc Severinsen, Jimmy Knepper and Clark Terry. Trumpeter Billy May was an arranger in the Charlie Barnet Orchestra before joining Glenn Miller in 1940.

Barnet was one of the first bandleaders to integrate his band, with more black musicians working for him than virtually all of the other popular white bandleaders. Trumpeters Roy Eldridge and Frankie Newton and bassist John Kirby joined in 1937. Lena Horne was one of Barnet&#x27;s vocalists. Unusually, for a mainly white group, Barnet was booked to perform at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and established a new attendance record. He was an outspoken admirer of Count Basie and Duke Ellington. Ellington recorded the Charlie Barnet composition &quot;In a Mizz&quot;. In 1939, in a gesture that was warmly appreciated and admired, Count Basie (who was booked 2 days after) lent Barnet some of his charts after his instruments, notes and arrangements had been destroyed in the famous fire at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles (October 2, 1939), which prevented Barnet&#x27;s last show there.

Throughout his career he was an opponent of syrupy arrangements. In the song &quot;The Wrong Idea&quot;, he lampooned the &quot;sweet&quot; big band sound of the era. The song was written by Billy May, who later used the same satirical bent in his collaborations with Stan Freberg on Capitol Records including the Lawrence Welk satire &quot;Wunnerful! Wunnerful!&quot; Barnet&#x27;s was a notorious party band where drinking and vandalism were not uncommon. While Glenn Miller enforced strict standards of dress and deportment, Barnet was more interested in having fun, according to his autobiography &quot;Those Swinging Years: The Autobiography of Charlie Barnet&quot;.

In 1949 he retired, apparently because he had lost interest in music. He was able to retire when he chose because he was one of the few heirs in a very wealthy family. He occasionally returned from retirement for brief tours but never returned to music full-time. In 1956, he released an album, &quot;Dance Bash&quot;, which was recorded over five years from 1947 to 1952.

Known for a unique sound and hard-swinging style on tenor saxophone, Barnet in the late 1930s added the alto saxophone to his arsenal, followed by the soprano saxophone, an instrument that had fallen out of favor after the 1920s and was not generally used in the big band era.

In September 1964, Barnet arranged a private party for his musical hero, Duke Ellington, and orchestra to play at Palm Springs&#x27; San Jacinto country club. At the door, a small sign painted by Barnet said: &quot;Any complaints about loud music or requests for excessive use of mutes will be grounds for instant expulsion (to a table in the parking lot). Any requests for folk music, twist, watusi, or rock and roll will result in instant execution by golf balls at 20 paces.&quot; Barnet did not play at the gathering.

Barnet&#x27;s theme song was &quot;Redskin Rhumba&quot;. His autobiography, &quot;Those Swinging Years: The Autobiography of Charlie Barnet&quot;, written with Stanley Dance, was published in 1984.

== Personal life ==

Barnet was married eleven times and in his autobiography says: &quot;I went through several more marital fiascos, but they were mostly Mexican marriages and quickly annulled, because they weren&#x27;t legal in the first place.&quot; His final marriage, to Betty Thompson, was for 33 years. He had one son, Charles D. Barnet Jr., and two grandchildren from an earlier marriage, Jennifer Ann Barnet and Darren Charles Barnet. During retirement, Barnet resided at homes in Palm Springs and San Diego, California. He kept a 46-foot boat in San Diego.

== Death ==
Barnet died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and pneumonia at San Diego&#x27;s Hillside hospital, on September 4, 1991, aged 77.

==Compositions==
Charlie Barnet&#x27;s compositions included &quot;Skyliner&quot;, &quot;Southland Shuffle&quot;, &quot;Swing Street Strut&quot;, &quot;The Right Idea&quot;, &quot;The Wrong Idea&quot; (with Billy May), &quot;Growlin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Scotch and Soda&quot;, &quot;Midweek Function&quot;, &quot;Oh, What You Said (Are We Burnt Up?)&quot;, &quot;I Kinda Like You&quot;, &quot;Tappin&#x27; at the Tappa&quot;, &quot;The Last Jump&quot;, &quot;Knocking at the Famous Door&quot;, &quot;Lazy Bug&quot; (with Juan Tizol), &quot;Ogoun Badagris (Voodoo War God)&quot;, &quot;Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie&quot;, and &quot;In a Mizz&quot;, which was also recorded by Duke Ellington.

&quot;Skyliner&quot;, arranged by Neal Hefti, was written as the theme music for the late 1940s US Armed Forces Network program &quot;Midnight In Munich&quot;, broadcast from the AFN station in Munich, Germany, and hosted by Ralph Moffat. Thanks to the station&#x27;s immensely powerful twin 100 kW transmitters, AFN Munich could be heard as far away as the UK; this, and the popularity of Moffat&#x27;s show, evidently helped &quot;Skyliner&quot; and many other contemporary American swing hits to gain wide popularity across Europe and become hits in the UK. The title (which was originally printed as &quot;Sky Liner&quot;) may be a reference to the practice of American pilots flying into Munich who used the radio station&#x27;s powerful signal to home in on the city.

==Discography==
Barnet had 78&#x27;s, 45&#x27;s, and 10&quot;/12&quot; LP&#x27;s from 1935 to his waning years. The record labels on which he appeared included: Bluebird Records/RCA Victor, Decca Records, Apollo Records, Capitol Records, Columbia Records, Mercury Records, Clef Records, Verve Records, Everest Records, Crown Records, Vault Records, Joyce Records, Ajax Records, and Calliope Records.
