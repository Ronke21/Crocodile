<text>The Tolpuddle Martyrs were six agricultural labourers from the village of Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, who were arrested and tried in 1834 for swearing a secret oath as members of a friendly society. Led by George Loveless, the group had formed the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers during a labour dispute over wage cuts that reduced their income to near-starvation levels. Such unions were technically legal, but the British government, wary of organised labour, invoked an obscure 1797 law against &quot;unlawful oaths&quot; to bring charges. In &quot;R v Loveless and Others&quot; the men were convicted and sentenced to penal transportation in Australia. They were pardoned in 1836 after mass protests by sympathisers and support from Lord John Russell, and returned to England between 1837 and 1839. Most of the men later emigrated to Canada.

The Tolpuddle Martyrs became a popular cause for the early union and workers&#x27; rights movements. Annual events in Tolpuddle honour their legacy.

==Historical events==

===Background===
In 1799 and 1800, the Combination Acts in the Kingdom of Great Britain had outlawed &quot;combining&quot; or organising to gain better working conditions, passed by Parliament because of a political scare following the French Revolution. In 1824, the Combination Acts were repealed due to their unpopularity and replaced with the Combinations of Workmen Act 1825, which legalised trade union organisations but severely restricted their activity.

By the start of the 19th century the county of Dorset had become synonymous with poorly paid agricultural labour. In 1815, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, 13% of the county&#x27;s population were receiving poor relief, and this worsened in the subsequent agricultural recession. By 1830 conditions were so bad that large numbers of labourers joined the Swing Riots that affected southern England that autumn; more than forty disturbances occurred in the county, involving two thirds of the labouring population in some parishes. A few landowners temporarily increased wages as a concession, but law enforcement was also increased and many labourers were arrested and imprisoned, and within a short time the gains in wages were reversed.

In 1833 six men from the village of Tolpuddle founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers as a friendly society to protest against the gradual lowering of agricultural wages. These Tolpuddle labourers refused to work for less than 10 shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings and were due to be further reduced to six. The Friendly Society&#x27;s rules show it was clearly structured as a friendly society that operated as a trade-specific benefit society, led by George Loveless, a Methodist local preacher, and meeting in the house of Thomas Standfield. Groups such as the Friendly Society would often use a skeleton painting as part of their initiation process, where the newest member would be blindfolded and made to swear a secret oath. The blindfold would then be removed and they would be presented with the skeleton painting to warn them of their own mortality but also to remind them of what happens to those who break their promises. An example of such a skeleton painting is on display at the People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester.

===Prosecution and sentencing===
In 1834, James Frampton, a magistrate and local landowner in Tolpuddle, wrote to Home Secretary Lord Melbourne to complain about the union, who recommended Frampton invoke the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797, an obscure law promulgated in response to the Spithead and Nore mutinies which prohibited the swearing of secret oaths. The Friendly Society&#x27;s members: James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George&#x27;s brother James Loveless, George&#x27;s brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas&#x27;s son John Standfield, were arrested. They were tried together before the judge Sir John Williams in the case &quot;R v Lovelass and Others&quot;. All six were found guilty of swearing secret oaths and sentenced to transportation to Australia.

When sentenced to seven years&#x27; penal transportation, George Loveless wrote on a scrap of paper lines from the union hymn &quot;The Gathering of the Unions&quot;:
===Transportation, pardon, return===

James Loveless, the two Standfields, Hammett and Brine sailed on the &quot;Surry&quot; to New South Wales, where they arrived in Sydney on 17 August 1834. George Loveless was delayed due to illness and left later on the &quot;William Metcalf&quot; to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, reaching Hobart on 4 September.

Of the five who landed in Sydney, Brine and the Standfields were assigned as farm labourers to free settlers in the Hunter Valley. Hammett was assigned to the Queanbeyan farm of Edward John Eyre, and James Loveless was assigned to a farm at Strathallan. In Hobart, George Loveless was assigned to the viceregal farm of Lieutenant Governor Sir George Arthur.
In England they became popular heroes and 800,000 signatures were collected for their release. Their supporters organised a political march, one of the first successful marches in the United Kingdom, and all were eventually pardoned in March 1836 on the condition of good conduct, with the support of Lord John Russell, who had recently become Home Secretary. When the pardon reached George Loveless some delay was caused in his leaving due to no word from his wife as to whether she was to join him in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. On 23 December 1836, a letter was received to the effect that she was not coming and Loveless sailed from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land on 30 January 1837, arriving in England on 13 June 1837.

In New South Wales, there were delays in obtaining an early sailing due to tardiness in the authorities confirming good conduct with the convicts&#x27; assignees and then getting them released from their assignments. James Loveless, Thomas and John Standfield, and James Brine departed Sydney on the &quot;John Barry&quot; on 11 September 1837, reaching Plymouth (one of the departure points for convict transport ships) on 17 March 1838. A plaque next to the Mayflower Steps in Plymouth&#x27;s historical Barbican area commemorates the arrival. Although due to depart with the others, James Hammett was detained in Windsor, charged with an assault, while the others left the colony. It was not until March 1839 that he sailed, arriving in England in August 1839.

===Later life===
The Lovelesses, Standfields and Brine first settled on farms near Chipping Ongar, Essex, upon their return from transportation, with the Lovelesses and Brine living at Tudor Cottage in Greensted Green. The five later emigrated to the town of London, Upper Canada (in present-day Ontario), where there is now a monument in their honour and an affordable housing co-op and trade union complex named after them. George Loveless and Thomas Standfield are buried in Siloam Cemetery on Fanshawe Park Road East in London, Ontario. James Brine died in 1902, having lived in nearby Blanshard Township since 1868, and is buried in St. Marys Cemetery, St. Marys, Ontario.

Hammett returned to Tolpuddle and died in the Dorchester workhouse in 1891.

==Museums==

The Tolpuddle Martyrs Museum in Tolpuddle, Dorset, features displays and interactive exhibits about the martyrs and their effect on trade unionism. The Shire Hall in Dorchester, where the Tolpuddle Martyrs were tried, is now a museum, including material about them.

==Cultural and historical significance==
A monument was erected in their honour in Tolpuddle in 1934, and a sculpture of the martyrs, made in 2001, stands in the village in front of the Tolpuddle Martyrs Museum.
The annual Tolpuddle Martyrs&#x27; Festival is usually held in the third week of July, organised by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and features a parade of banners from many trade unions, a memorial service, speeches, and music. Recent festivals have featured speakers such as Tony Benn, musicians such as Billy Bragg, and local folk singers including Graham Moore, as well as others from all around the world.

The courtroom where the martyrs were tried, which has been little altered in 200 years, in Dorchester&#x27;s Shire Hall, is being preserved as part of a heritage scheme.

The story of Tolpuddle has enriched the history of trade unionism, but the significance of the Tolpuddle Martyrs continues to be debated since Sidney and Beatrice Webb wrote the &quot;History of Trade Unionism&quot; (1894) and continues with such works as Bob James&#x27;s &quot;Craft Trade or Mystery&quot; (2001).

The following places are named in their honour:
* Tolpuddle Street, Islington, London
* Tolpuddle Way, Kirkdale, Liverpool
* Tolpuddle Vineyard, Richmond, Tasmania

In 1984, a mural was created in Edward Square, off Copenhagen Street, Islington, to commemorate the gathering of people organised by the Central Committee of the Metropolitan Trade Unions to demonstrate against the penal transportation of the Tolpuddle Martyrs to Australia. The mural was painted by artist David Bangs.

In 1985 a memorial plaque for the Tolpuddle Martyrs was installed in Garema Place in the centre of Australia&#x27;s capital city Canberra.

&quot;Comrades&quot; is a 1986 British historical drama film directed by Bill Douglas and starring an ensemble cast including James Fox, Robert Stephens and Vanessa Redgrave. Through the pictures of a travelling lanternist, it depicts the story of the Tolpuddle Martyrs.

A workshop production, based on the film &quot;Comrades&quot;, was performed at the Northcott Theatre, Exeter on 23 March 2023 and told the story of The Tolpuddle Martyrs up to the time of their arrest. It was written and directed by Tony Lidington and performed by drama students from the University of Exeter.

A musical drama by Alan Plater and Vince Hill, &#x27;Tolpuddle&#x27;, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 16 October 1982.

The Tolpuddle Martyrs also find reference in a poem by Daljit Nagra: &quot;Vox Populi, Vox Dei&quot;.

The men who returned to Plymouth from Australia were commemorated with a plaque made by Clifford Harper at a ceremony in March 2020.

<text>Antti Veikko Ilmari &quot;Jammu&quot; Siltavuori (29 October 1926 – 9 March 2012) was a Finnish child murderer and sex offender, and was commonly known by the nickname Uncle Jammu.

==Early life and previous crimes==
Veikko Siltavuori was born in Vaasa, Finland. There is little information about his early childhood. According to some sources, Siltavuori&#x27;s childhood was difficult because of an alcoholic father who frequently physically abused him. He was bullied in school and called a weasel because of his dirty clothing. Before the murders, he became &quot;fairly wealthy&quot; despite his described shabbiness and had inherited a large fortune.

Siltavuori previously had a wife and had a son and an adopted daughter. Prior to the murders, he had been convicted of raping a five-year-old girl, sexual harassment, and attempted murder for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the 1960s, but was later paroled&quot;.&quot; In 1966, his ex-wife was interviewed in the magazine &quot;Hymy&quot; regarding his release. In Paltamo, Kainuu, he had rented a farm and built a jail complete with cells, barred windows and small toilets, police were not completely sure whether the prison was built for child victims.

After his release, he lured numerous children to his cabin in Vihti where he would offer them alcoholic beverages, bathe with them in his sauna (whilst he was naked and they remained clothed) and play video games with them. Afterwards, he would give the youths money in exchange for them not to tell anyone they had met.

On 3 March, 1989, Siltavuori lured two 8-year-old girls, Päivi-Maria Hopiavuori and Tanja Johanna Pirinen, from their homes in Myllypuro to his car where he then drove to his cottage in Vihti. Upon arrival he attempted to bribe the girls with money in exchange for them not to tell anyone that they had met him, however due to the girls young age, the money held no worth to them. He first murdered Pirinen by giving her a lethal dose of pentobarbital before strangling Hopiavuori to death, eventually setting fire to their bodies by putting them in barrels and dousing them with gasoline, neighbours to the cottage witnessed Siltavuori burning the bodies but mistook the remains as trash. After burning their bodies, he packed the remains of the fire in the trunk of his Ford Granada and drove back to Helsinki. 

== Investigation and arrest ==
Hopiavuori&#x27;s mother became concerned when she had not heard from the girls by evening, and called 911 at approximately 10:46 p.m. Based on internal investigations and archival research conducted by the Criminal Police Office of Violence, a group of police investigators were sent on 5 March to investigate Siltavuori&#x27;s apartment, which was located a couple of kilometers from Myllypuro. Within his refrigerator, in which a total of 300 chocolate bars were found, which police suspected that he used to attract children, although he himself claimed to be diabetic and to keep the chocolate bars in case his blood sugar dropped too low. There were also many children&#x27;s films in the apartment.

Police searched his Ford Granada and within the trunk they found ash and teeth, which they used to determine that the remains were of the two girls, there were no signs that the girls had been raped however fibres from the other girl&#x27;s clothes were found in Siltavuori&#x27;s underwear.

==Legal proceedings and imprisonment==
For the two murders in 1989, Siltavuori was sentenced to 15 years in prison with the possibility of parole after 10 years, because a mental health examination legally found him to be partially insane. If that had not been the case, Siltavuori would have been again sentenced to life imprisonment.

After 10 years elapsed, his first and second parole hearings in a Prison Court were unsuccessful. After he served one more year in jail, the Prison Court released him on strictly supervised parole on 31 January 2000, on his third parole hearing. However, he was immediately involuntary committed to the Niuvanniemi mental hospital in Kuopio for criminal-psychiatric reasons. The involuntary commitment was reaffirmed in 2007 by the administrative court of Kuopio, on the basis that if he was released, he would be a serious security risk.

While Siltavuori was on remand in Vaasa Prison in August 1989, one of his fellow prisoners hit him on the head with a heavy stool, causing Siltavuori to lose consciousness and suffer a profusely bleeding wound to the head. The attacker was sentenced to three months in prison in addition to his previous sentence and to pay Siltavuori 750 marks in compensation for pain and suffering. Siltavuori&#x27;s lawsuit for attempted murder was dismissed. During his imprisonment, Siltavuori participated in therapy for sex offenders.

==Death==
While imprisoned, Siltavuori was attacked for the second time by another inmate, which caused Siltavuori to spend his final years in a wheelchair. He died in March 2012 at the age of 85 in Kuopio.

== Media publicity ==
The murders led to widespread media publicity, during which hundreds of letters to the editor were written about Siltavuori. An interview with Siltavuori was published in the April 1991 issue of &quot;Rikosposti&quot;, in which he said that he believed he was the most hated person in Finland. There were demands for him to receive death penalty and castration as punishment.

Antti Siltavuori, an industrial designer from Kirkkonummi, was the target of a telephone terror because of his name, and an old man was beaten in a restaurant in Helsinki because he resembled Siltavuori in appearance. The protesters&#x27; signs read, among other things: &quot;A sex offender does not get better in prison. Experts in favor of involuntary treatment.&quot;

<text>In demonology, Ipos (also referred to as Aiperos, Ayperos, Ayporos or Ipes) is an Earl and powerful Prince of Hell (a Duke to some authors) who has thirty-six legions of demons under his command. He knows and can reveal all things, past, present and future (only the future to some authors, and past and future to others). He can make men witty and valiant.

He is commonly depicted with the body of an angel with the head of a lion, the tail of a hare, and the feet of a goose, less frequently in the same shape but with the body of a lion, and rarely as a vulture.

== In popular culture ==
Ipos is portrayed as a tactics teacher in the anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun.

<doc id="258690" wikidata="Q241120" url="?curid=258690" title="Anyte">
<text>Anyte of Tegea (; ) was a Hellenistic poet from Tegea in Arcadia. Little is known of her life, but twenty-four epigrams attributed to her are preserved in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, and one is quoted by Julius Pollux; nineteen of these are generally accepted as authentic. She introduced rural themes to the genre, which became a standard theme in Hellenistic epigrams. She is one of the nine outstanding ancient women poets listed by Antipater of Thessalonica in the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;. Her pastoral poetry may have influenced Theocritus, and her works were adapted by several later poets, including Ovid.

== Life ==
No reliable information about Anyte&#x27;s life survives, and she can only be approximately dated by the style of her work. Based on this, and on possible imitations of her works in the second half of the third century BC, she is generally thought to have been active around 300 BC. According to Julius Pollux, writing in the second century AD, she was from Tegea in Arcadia. An alternative tradition, recorded in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, claimed that Anyte was from Mytilene on Lesbos. Anyte&#x27;s use of a Doric dialect, and mentions in her poem of Tegea and the Arcadian god Pan, suggest that a Tegean origin is more likely, though Pollux may have simply assumed this on the basis of Anyte&#x27;s mention of Tegea. The story of a Lesbian origin was likely a later invention to link Anyte to Sappho. 

Only one story about Anyte&#x27;s life is preserved. Pausanias claims that she was once visited by the god Asclepius while she was asleep, and told to go to Naupactus to visit a certain blind man there. On doing so, the man was cured, and he built a temple to Asclepius. Though little is known about Anyte&#x27;s life, more of her poetry survives than any other ancient Greek woman, with the exception of Sappho.

== Poetry ==
Twenty-five epigrams attributed to Anyte in antiquity survive, one quoted by Julius Pollux and the remainder in the &quot;Palatine&quot; or &quot;Planudean Anthology&quot;. Of these, nineteen are generally agreed to be by Anyte. Of the remaining six, four are attributed to both Anyte and another author in either the &quot;Palatine&quot; or &quot;Planudean Anthology&quot;, and two epigrams are attributed to Anyte by the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, but are included without an author named in the Planudean. Of these six uncertain poems, two (AP 7.190 and 7.232) are considered possibly or probably by Anyte; the others are generally doubted. It is likely that Anyte compiled a book of her poetry from her epigrams – she may have been the first to do so. The &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; twice refers to her as &quot;the lyric poet&quot;, and Pausanias mentions her epic poetry, but neither lyric nor epic poetry by Anyte survive.

Anyte&#x27;s poetry is composed in a mixed dialect, with elements of Doric and epic language, as well as some Atticisms; it was common for Hellenistic poets to deliberately mix dialects in this way. It is often interested in women and children, and Kathryn Gutzwiller argues that it was deliberately composed in opposition to traditional epigrams, which were by anonymous authors and from a masculine and urban perspective. Accordingly, of five epitaphs written by Anyte which survive, only one marks the death of a young man, as was traditional in the genre; the remaining four all commemorate women who died young. She is most famous for her epitaphs for animals and pastoral epigrams describing idyllic landscapes. Two dedicatory epigrams by Anyte also survive.

Anyte&#x27;s poetry was, like that of her contemporaries, highly allusive, particularly referencing Homer. She imitates the structure and syntax of Homer&#x27;s poetry, making use of Homeric vocabulary to write about personal and domestic themes. For instance, Anyte&#x27;s epigram 6, an epitaph dedicated to the unmarried Antibia, repeatedly echoes phrases from the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. She also echoes Homer in her frequent use of compound adjectives, such as her description of the &quot;poikilodeiros&quot; (&quot;with a neck of many colours&quot;) snake in epigram 10. Her work references Hesiod, archaic Greek lyric and Attic drama, and shows evidence that she was familiar with the epigrams of Simonides of Ceos and Anacreon. Several of her epigrams allude to the works of Erinna, a female poet of the early Hellenistic period.

==Reception==
Anyte&#x27;s pastoral poems and epitaphs for pets were important innovations, with both genres becoming standards in Hellenistic poetry. Her pastoral works may have influenced Theocritus, and both Ovid and Marcus Argentarius wrote adaptations of her poems; the epigrammatist Mnasalces produced an epigram collection in imitation of Anyte. An epigram by Posidippus on the death of a young woman references one of Anyte&#x27;s poems as well as Sappho and Erinna. Mary Maxwell suggests that the style of the Augustan poet Sulpicia was influenced by Anyte and her contemporary, Nossis. Antipater of Thessalonica lists her in his canon of nine women poets. According to Tatian, statues of Anyte were sculpted by Cephisodotus and Euthycrates.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Anyte&#x27;s poetry was highly thought of by the Imagist poets, with Richard Aldington describing her in his translation of Greek and Latin poetry as the &quot;woman-Homer&quot;. Modern scholars have been more critical of Anyte&#x27;s work, considering her subjects frivolous. However, Josephine Balmer describes her poetry as &quot;stunning&quot;, and argues that it demonstrates both education and technical skill. H.D. adapted one of Anyte&#x27;s epigrams in her poem &quot;Hermes of the Ways&quot;; she is one of the women included on Judy Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Heritage Floor&quot;, is represented in Anselm Kiefer&#x27;s series &quot;Women in Antiquity&quot;, and has a crater on Mercury named after her.

<text>Richard Granville Swinburne (; born 26 December 1934) is an English philosopher. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford. Over the last 50 years, Swinburne has been a proponent of philosophical arguments for the existence of God. His philosophical contributions are primarily in the philosophy of religion and philosophy of science. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of &quot;The Coherence of Theism&quot;, &quot;The Existence of God&quot;, and &quot;Faith and Reason&quot;. He has been influential in reviving substance dualism as an option in philosophy of mind.

== Early life ==
Swinburne was born in Smethwick, Staffordshire, England, on 26 December 1934. His father was a school music teacher, who was himself the son of an off-licence owner in Shoreditch. His mother was a secretary, the daughter of an optician. He is an only child. Swinburne attended a preparatory school and then Charterhouse School.

==Academic career==
Swinburne received an open scholarship to study classics at Exeter College, Oxford, but in fact graduated with a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy, politics, and economics. Swinburne has held various professorships throughout his career in academia. From 1972 to 1985, he taught at Keele University. During part of this time, he gave the Gifford lectures at Aberdeen from 1982 to 1984, resulting in the book &quot;The Evolution of the Soul&quot;. From 1985 until his retirement in 2002, he was Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion at the University of Oxford (his successor to this chair was Brian Leftow). He has continued to publish regularly since his retirement.

Swinburne has been an active author throughout his career, producing a major book every two to three years. He has played a role in the recent debate over the mind–body problem, defending a substance dualism that recalls the work of René Descartes in important respects (see &quot;The Evolution of the Soul&quot;, 1997).

His books are primarily very technical works of academic philosophy, but he has written at the popular level as well. Of the non-technical works, his &quot;Is There a God?&quot; (1996), summarising for a non-specialist audience many of his arguments for the existence of God and plausibility in the belief of that existence, is probably the most popular and is available in 22 languages.

In 1992 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. He is a recipient of James Joyce Award from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin. Also, he was awarded honorary doctorates by the Catholic University of Lublin (2015), Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University in Bucharest (2016), the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein (2017), and New Georgian University in Poti (2023).

==Christian apologetics==

A member of the Orthodox Church, Swinburne is noted as one of the foremost Christian apologists, arguing in his many articles and books that faith in Christianity is rational and coherent in a rigorous philosophical sense. William Hasker writes that his &quot;tetralogy on Christian doctrine, together with his earlier trilogy on the philosophy of theism, is one of the most important apologetic projects of recent times.&quot; While Swinburne presents many arguments to advance the belief that God exists, he argues that God is a being whose existence is not logically necessary (see modal logic) but metaphysically necessary in a way he defines in his &quot;The Christian God&quot;. Other subjects on which Swinburne writes include personal identity (in which he espouses a view based on the concept of a soul), and epistemic justification. He has written in defence of Cartesian dualism and libertarian free will.

Although he is best known for his vigorous defence of Christian intellectual commitments, he also has a theory of the nature of passionate faith which is developed in his book &quot;Faith and Reason&quot;.

According to an interview Swinburne did with &quot;Foma&quot; magazine, he converted from Anglicanism (Church of England) to Eastern Orthodoxy around 1996:
I don&#x27;t think I changed my beliefs in any significant way. I always believed in the Apostolic succession: that the Church has to have its authority dating back to the Apostles, and the general teaching of the Orthodox Church on the saints and the prayers for the departed and so on, these things I have always believed.

Swinburne&#x27;s philosophical method reflects the influence of Thomas Aquinas. He admits that he draws from Aquinas a systematic approach to philosophical theology. Swinburne, like Aquinas, moves from basic philosophical issues (for example, the question of the possibility that God may exist in Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;The Coherence of Theism&quot;), to more specific Christian beliefs (for example, the claim in Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Revelation&quot; that God has communicated to human beings propositionally in Jesus Christ).

In an interview with &quot;Veery&quot; journal, Swinburne summed up his place in philosophy: &quot;I’m very much in the modern Anglo-American tradition of philosophy which I believe is basically the tradition of philosophy since Plato.&quot;

Swinburne moves in his writing program from the philosophical to the theological, building his case and relying on his previous arguments as he defends particular Christian beliefs. He has attempted to reassert classical Christian beliefs with an apologetic method that he believes is compatible with contemporary science. That method relies heavily on inductive logic, seeking to show that his Christian beliefs fit best with the evidence.

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1672/15) with Richard Swinburne in 2015–2016 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.

<doc id="258695" wikidata="Q392930" url="?curid=258695" title="Ŭ">
<text>Ŭ or ŭ is a letter in the Belarusian Latin alphabet used since 1840/1845, based on &quot;u&quot;. It is also used in the Esperanto alphabet, publicly presented in 1887, and formerly in the Romanian alphabet. The accent mark (diacritic) is known as a breve.

This letter should not be confused with u-caron, which is used to indicate u in the third tone of Chinese language pinyin; compare (caron) with (breve). 

It resembles an italic form of a Cyrillic Short I (&quot;&quot;).

==Belarusian==

The letter &quot;ŭ&quot; is called &quot;non-syllabic u&quot; (romanised: &quot;u nieskładovaje&quot;) in Belarusian because it resembles the vowel &quot;u&quot; but forms no syllables. It is an allophone of that forms the diphthongs &quot;aŭ, eŭ, oŭ&quot; and is equivalent to . Its Cyrillic counterpart is ў. Sometimes (as in &quot;National Geographic&quot; atlases), the Cyrillic letter ў is Romanized as &quot;w&quot;.

The letter &quot;ŭ&quot; was proposed by Alexander Rypinski in 1840. For lack of the corresponding type, his book &quot;Białoruś. Kilka słów o poezji prostego ludu tej naszej polskiej prowincji, o jego muzyce, śpiewie, tańcach&quot; was printed with &quot;û&quot; in Belarusian citations instead, but it was explained that the proper letter was &quot;u&quot; with Latin &quot;brevis&quot;. The proper letter &quot;ŭ&quot; was first used in printing in 1845, in the novel &quot;Tajemnicze domino czyli Skutki niestałości&quot; by Gabriel Ossowski (in Polish with occasional Belarusian).

==Esperanto==

Ŭ represents a semivowel in the orthography of Esperanto, which is an international auxiliary language publicly presented in 1887. As in Belarusian, Esperanto Ŭ is pronounced as a non-syllabic , primarily in the diphthongs &quot;aŭ&quot;, &quot;eŭ&quot; and rarely &quot;oŭ&quot;.

It is thought that &quot;ŭ&quot; was created by analogy with the Belarusian letter ў (Cyrillic &quot;u&quot; with breve), which was proposed by P.A. Bessonov in 1870. It may also be considered that the placement of the breve above a vowel letter to turn it into an equivalent semivowel was inspired by the use thereof on the Cyrillic letter &quot;й&quot;, representing /j/ and formed by placing a breve over the letter &quot;и&quot;, used most commonly to represent /i/.

&quot;Ŭ&quot; may also be used for [w] in foreign names, such as &quot;Ŭaŝingtono&quot; for &quot;Washington&quot;, although it usually is written with &quot;v (Vaŝingtono)&quot;. It is also used for [w] in onomatopoeias, as in &quot;ŭa!&quot; &quot;waa!&quot;, and uniquely in one native lexical word, &quot;ŭo,&quot; which is the Esperanto name of the letter &quot;ŭ&quot; itself.

==Romanian==

Ŭ was previously part of the Romanian alphabet. U with breve was used only in the ending of a word. It was essentially a Latin equivalent of the Slavonic back yer found in languages like Russian. Unpronounced in most cases, it served to indicate that the previous consonant was not palatalized, or that the preceding i was the vowel [i] and not a mere marker of palatalization. When ŭ was pronounced, it would follow a stressed vowel and stand in for semivowel u, as in words eŭ, aŭ, and meŭ, all spelled today without the breve. Once frequent, it survives today in author Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s name – originally spelled Mateiŭ (it is not specified whether the pronunciation should adopt a version that he himself probably never used, while in many editions he is still credited as Matei). In other names, only the breve was dropped, while preserving the pronunciation of a semivowel u, as is the case of B.P. Hasdeŭ.

==Romanization of Indic scripts==

When transcribing Malayalam texts into ISO 15919, usually the final glottal-stop is transcribed as &#x27;ŭ&#x27;, an epenthetic vowel (a rule called as ). In Tamil, any wordfinal-&#x27;u&#x27; is always a short-vowel, hence transcribing it as &#x27;ŭ&#x27; (a rule called as ). The Kashmiri vowel / is also sometimes transcribed as &#x27;ŭ&#x27;.

==Other uses==
In some philological transcriptions of Latin, &quot;ŭ&quot; denotes a short U — for example, &quot;fŭgō&quot; (, &quot;to chase away&quot;), vs &quot;fūmō&quot; (, &quot;to smoke&quot;).

The letter is also commonly used among Slavists to denote the short back closed vowel of Proto-Slavic.

The McCune–Reischauer Romanization of Korean uses &quot;ŭ&quot; to signify the close back unrounded vowel in 으.

Several schemes for pronunciation of English words have used &quot;ŭ&quot;. For example, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language has used &quot;ŭ&quot; for , the vowel in the English word &quot;cut&quot;.

In Kurrentschrift, an outdated script used in German handwriting, the lower-case letter &quot;u&quot; is adorned with a breve to distinguish it from the otherwise identical letter &quot;n&quot;. The script was used for teaching writing in schools; the last variant, known as Sütterlinschrift, as late as 1941. The ingrained habit of writing &quot;ŭ&quot; for &quot;u&quot; persisted for a long time even as people switched to cursive scripts with easily distinguishable shapes for &quot;u&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, occasionally leading to confusion between &quot;ŭ&quot; (meaning &quot;u&quot;) and &quot;ü&quot; among later generations not brought up with this tick.

<text>Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game. The purpose of FEN is to provide all the necessary information to restart a game from a particular position.

FEN is based on a system developed by Scottish newspaper journalist David Forsyth. His system became popular in the 19th century, then Steven J. Edwards extended it to support its use by computers. FEN is defined in the &quot;Portable Game Notation Specification and Implementation Guide&quot;. In the Portable Game Notation for chess games, FEN is used to define initial positions other than the standard one. FEN does not provide sufficient information to decide whether a draw by threefold repetition may be legally claimed or a draw offer may be accepted; for that, a different format such as Extended Position Description is needed.

==Definition==
A FEN record desition, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set. A text file with only FEN data records should use the filename extension codice_1.

A FEN record contains six fields, each separated by a space. The fields are as follows:
# Piece placement data: Each is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1, with a &quot;/&quot; between each one; within each rank, the contents of the squares are described in order from the a- to the h-file. Each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names in algebraic notation (pawn = &quot;P&quot;, knight = &quot;N&quot;, bishop = &quot;B&quot;, rook = &quot;R&quot;, queen = &quot;Q&quot; and king = &quot;K&quot;). White pieces are designated using uppercase letters (&quot;PNBRQK&quot;), while black pieces use lowercase letters (&quot;pnbrqk&quot;). A set of one or more consecutive empty squares within a rank is denoted by a digit from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;8&quot;, corresponding to the number of squares.
# Active color: &quot;w&quot; means that White is to move; &quot;b&quot; means that Black is to move.
# Castling availability: If neither side has the ability to castle, this field uses the character &quot;-&quot;. Otherwise, this field contains one or more letters: &quot;K&quot; if White can castle kingside, &quot;Q&quot; if White can castle queenside, &quot;k&quot; if Black can castle kingside, and &quot;q&quot; if Black can castle queenside. A situation that temporarily prevents castling does not prevent the use of this notation.
# &quot;En passant&quot; target square: This is a square over which a pawn has just passed while moving two squares; it is given in algebraic notation. If there is no &quot;en passant&quot; target square, this field uses the character &quot;-&quot;. This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to capture &quot;en passant&quot;. An updated version of the spec has since made it so the target square is recorded only if a legal &quot;en passant&quot; capture is possible, but the old version of the standard is the one most commonly used.
# Halfmove clock: The number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance, used for the fifty-move rule.
# Fullmove number: The number of the full moves. It starts at 1 and is incremented after Black&#x27;s move.

==Examples==
The following example is from the FEN specification:

Here is the FEN for the starting position:
And after the move 1.e4:
And then after 1...c5:
And then after 2.Nf3:
==FEN adjustment for chess variants like Chess960 ==
FEN is crucial for recording games in chess variants such as Chess960 (also known as Fischer Random Chess), where the initial position is not necessarily the traditional initial position. However, the FEN castling availability encoding (KQkq) is inadequate when both rooks are on the same side of the king on the back rank (as a result of one rook having moved, or in a form of randomised chess that allows it in a starting position): if either rook is still available for castling, it would be ambiguous which rook this is without knowing their initial positions. The solution implemented by chess engines like Shredder and Fritz_9 is to use the letters of the columns on which the rooks began the game. This scheme is sometimes called Shredder-FEN. For the traditional setup, Shredder-FEN would use AHah instead of KQkq.

Another solution is offered by X-FEN, which offers more backward compatibility than Shredder-FEN does, but at the cost of more complexity.

<text>Vassago (also &quot;Vasago&quot;, &quot;Usagoo&quot;) is a demon described in demonological grimoires such as the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; and the &quot;Book of the Office of Spirits&quot;.

== Lesser Key of Solomon ==
He is the third demon in the &quot;Lesser Key&quot; (including Thomas Rudd&#x27;s variant) and is referred to as a prince &quot;of a good nature&quot; and of the &quot;same nature as Agares&quot;. He rules twenty-six legions of spirits, and is summoned to tell magicians of past and future events, and locate lost objects. He is one of the few spirits found in the Lesser Key of Solomon but not in Johann Weyer&#x27;s Pseudomonarchia Daemonum.

According to Rudd, Vassago is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Sitael.

== Other works ==
Vassago is mentioned in the &quot;Book of the Office of Spirits&quot; as Usagoo, appearing as an angel, &quot;just and true in all his doings,&quot; with the powers of inciting the love of women and revealing hidden treasures, in addition to ruling twenty spirits. Sloane MS 3824 mentions Vassago in invocations to summon spirits that guard treasure, and in the &quot;Experiment of Vassago&quot; and the &quot;Experiment of Agares,&quot; both intended to capture the named spirits in crystals.

Vassago is mentioned in the novel &quot;Hideaway&quot; by Dean Koontz, and in its film adaptation.

Murderer and vampire-themed cult leader Rod Ferrell used &quot;Vassago&quot; as a &quot;vampire name&quot; and burned a V representing this alias onto his victims; Ferrell did not know how to spell or pronounce Vassago&#x27;s name correctly, and typically called himself &quot;Vesago&quot;.

Vassago appears as a character in the animated web series &quot;Helluva Boss&quot; (voiced by Harvey Guillén), alongside some other Goetia demons like Paimon, Stolas and Andrealphus.

<doc id="258700" wikidata="Q7171565" url="?curid=258700" title="Pet adoption">
<text>Pet adoption is the process of transferring responsibility for a pet that was previously owned by another party. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters, rescue groups, or other pet owners. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the organization retains some control over the animal&#x27;s future use or care.

Online pet adoption sites have databases, searchable by the public, of pets being housed by thousands of animal shelters and rescue groups.

==Before adoption==
Animals are placed up for adoption for numerous reasons like being abandoned, lost, or rehomed from their current family. The need for rehoming sometimes results from allergies, death of a pet-owner, divorce, the birth of a baby, or relocation. Additionally, adoption mayweather, and traffic and enter adoption shelters in need of medical attention before entering the adoption process. After medical examinations, treatments, and behavioral tests, adoption centers (at their discretion) determine if the pet is healthy enough for adoption.

Euthanasia (also known as &quot;putting down&quot; or &quot;putting to sleep&quot;) is another method that has been used when dealing with animals who may suffer from terminal illnesses, injuries, or over-population in shelters, although many veterinarians do not consider this to be an ethical use of their resources for young and healthy animals, while others argue that euthanasia is a more humane option than leaving a pet in a cage for very long periods of time.

Homes cannot always be found, however, and euthanasia is often used for the excess animals to make room for newer pets unless the organization has a no-kill policy. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that 2.4 million healthy, adoptable cats and dogs are euthanized each year in the US because of a lack of homes. Animal protection advocates campaign for adoption instead of buying animals in order to reduce the number of animals who have to be euthanized. Many shelters and animal rescues encourage the education of spaying or neutering a pet in order to reduce the number of animals euthanized in shelters and to help control the pet population.
To help lower the number of animals euthanized each year, some shelters have developed a no-kill policy. Best Friends Animal Society is the largest no-kill shelter in the United States who adopts policies such as &quot;Save Them All&quot;. This shelter and many others strive to keep their animals as long as it takes to find them new homes. City shelters and government-funded shelters rarely have this policy because of the large number of animals they receive.

No-kill shelters are usually run by groups that have volunteers or individuals with enough space to foster pets until a permanent home can be found. However, many of these groups and individuals have a finite number of spaces available. This means they will not take in new animals unless a space opens up, although they will often take back pets that they have adopted out previously. Sometimes they try to find foster homes where the animal can be placed temporarily until someone adopts it.

Physical appearance, behavior, and health of the dog play crucial roles in the pet adoption decision-making process, with many adopters prioritizing appearance over health. Social influences, such as breed popularity trends, and demographic factors, including household size and the presence of children, significantly affect the likelihood of dog ownership. Additionally, prior experience with dogs is a strong predictor of future dog adoption. Understanding these factors can help develop strategies to encourage responsible adoption practices and reduce the rates of dog relinquishment to shelters.

== Adoption process ==
The central issue in adoption is whether the new adopter can provide a safe, secure, and permanent home for the adopted pet. Shelters, pounds, and rescue organizations can refuse to supply pets to people whom they deem unable to provide a suitable home. A new owner may face training or behavioral challenges with a pet who has been neglected, abused, or left untrained. Adoption centers recommend patience, training, persistence, and consistency of care to help the pet overcome its past and get comfortable with the adopter.

In Canada, reputable animal shelters or humane societies go through an extensive process to ensure that potential pets and their respective families are well-suited and prepared for their lives ahead. Adoption fees include spaying/neutering, veterinary care including all updated vaccinations, microchipping, and pet insurance. Phone interviews, written questionnaires, and in-person visits gather information on the potential family&#x27;s history with pets, their lifestyle, habits, and their ability to take on the conditions of the adopted pet. Adult pets can be more difficult to place because of existing habits or behaviors that are difficult to manage or unwanted. A rescue pet&#x27;s unknown history may also complicate its ability to be adopted. Shelters and humane societies remain connected with information packages on why pets are unwanted, what to expect in the first weeks of pet adoption, guides, recommendations, specific behavior training requests, and follow-up calls to ensure that everyone is satisfied with the adoption.

A &quot;forever home&quot; is the home of an adopter who agrees to be responsible for the animal for the remainder of the pet&#x27;s life. There are two basic understandings of the concept. A broad interpretation simply says that the adopter of the pet agrees that the animal&#x27;s well-being is now their personal responsibility for the rest of the animal&#x27;s life. If the adopter can no longer keep the animal for any reason, they would need to be responsible for finding a healthy and happy home for the animal. Many animal shelters require adopters to return the animal to the shelter if they can no longer care for the animal.

The adopter should have a plan in place for the care of the animal in the event of the adopter dying before the pet. A more restrictive view that some shelters attempt to integrate as part of the adoption agreement puts conditions on when and why the adopter could arrange to move the animal to a new family. Some agreements might specify allergies or violent behavior on the part of the animal as reasons allowable for an adopter to relinquish the animal. It is common for families to celebrate Gotcha Day on the anniversary of the animal&#x27;s arrival at their forever home.

Education about and promotion of pet adoption is also done by animal welfare organizations and by local government animal control agencies. In 2016, the U.S. state of Georgia made the &quot;adoptable dog&quot; its state dog, similar to Colorado&#x27;s adopted dog.

After filling out an application to adopt an animal, there is also an adoption fee that must be paid to adopt an animal. Adoption fees serve several purposes. If someone is willing to pay for an animal, chances are they will take care of him or her and not abuse or neglect their new pet. Most animals of age are spayed or neutered and up to date on all of their shots. Depending on the shelter or organization, some pets may be microchipped, which helps locate them if they are lost. The adoption fees help cover these costs and also help provide food for the animals left in the shelter.

==Big Black Dog syndrome and related concerns==
&quot;Black Dog Syndrome (BDS) or Big Black Dog Syndrome (BBDS) is defined as “the extreme under-adoption of large black dogs based not on temperament or health, but rather on the confluence of a number of physical and environmental factors in conjunction with the Western symbolism of the color black.” &quot;BDB was coined after reports from several animal shelters showed that black dogs are less likely to be adopted and are more likely to be euthanized, compared with lighter-colored dogs.&quot;

Historically there are negative associations around black animals, but there are many biases associated with particular breeds and lineages of dogs that also lead to bias and higher euthanasia rates. Some studies have suggested that: &quot;BDB is a product of the social cognition phenomena known as &#x27;base rate fallacy&#x27;: black dogs are only more common in shelters because there are more of them (the dark color gene is dominant).&quot;

A 2016 study in Kentucky found that &quot;the significant interaction between breed size and coat shade did not support the purported BBDS: big dogs had similar outcomes regardless of color, and among smaller dogs, black dogs had worse outcomes than non-black counterparts.&quot; A 2024 study by Kulak found that: &quot;The existence of BDB is inconsistent across empirical and anecdotal literature (e.g., Goleman et al., 2014). Our research suppports that BDB might not be entirely founded; rather, BDB might be a product of base rate fallacy or other factors entirely.&quot; &quot;Examining a large municipal animal shelter with a large number of dog and cat data, color and coat pattern were implicated in adoption rates, with more light-colored animals adopted and fewer euthanized than their dark-colored and patterned counterparts. &quot;Wells and Hepper (1992) reported that potential adopters at an animal shelter in Northern Ireland preferred photographs of dogs with blonde over black coats, but when compared with actual purchase records, the color provided no significant impact on purchase.&quot; &quot;[A] study on dogs held at two no-kill shelters in New York State found that color was not implicated in length of stay.&quot; &quot;[S]ome research found no evidence for BDB (Trevathan-Minnis et al., 2021), instead determining that purebred status and size matter more.&quot;

== Pet ownership ==
According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) (2018), being responsible for a pet requires commitment and should be considered a privilege. Similar to having children, the pet depends on the owner for their needs such as food and shelter, exercise and mental stimulation, and veterinary care. When choosing to adopt a pet, the lifestyle of the owner and the pet are recommended to be compatible. Once a pet is chosen, the owner is recommended to identify it the pet needs and medical attention like being spayed or neutered. If a situation arises that the owner can no longer provide a suitable household for the animal, rehoming is recommended. The AVMA presents guidelines for being a responsible pet owner. This guideline is a resource of things to consider before becoming a pet owner.

==Rescue dog==
A rescue dog is a dog that has been placed in a new home after being abused, neglected, or abandoned by its previous owner. The term can also apply to dogs that are found as strays, surrendered by owners for a variety of reasons, including relationship breakdowns, moving home where the owner is unable or unwilling to take their pets, or elderly people who are not permitted to take their dog(s) into a nursing home.

Many animal rescue organisations exist to rescue, care for and re-home dogs and protect them from unnecessary euthanasia. Common examples include the RSPCA in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, the ISPCA in Ireland, or the ASPCA in the United States. Many rescue dogs are rehomed quickly, but some wait longer for a home. This may be relevant when the dog is older. Some agencies provide ongoing health care and support for older dogs after they have been placed in a home. There are several charities dedicated to rescuing and rehoming older dogs.

The ASPCA estimates that approximately 3.3 million dogs in the United States enter shelters each year. Of these, 1.6 million are adopted, 670,000 are euthanized, and 620,000 are returned to their previous owners. A study conducted by the United States National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy (NCPPSP) in 1998 found that the main reasons for pets being relinquished are: family moving, landlord will not allow pets, too many animals in household, cost of keeping the pet, owner is having personal problems, inadequate facilities, and no homes available for puppies. The study found that 47.7% of dogs turned in to shelters were not altered (spayed or neutered), 33% had not been to a veterinarian, and 96% of dogs had no obedience training. The conclusion of the researchers was that the owners who were relinquishing their pets did not have the knowledge to be responsible dog owners, and that educational programs aimed at present and prospective owners would reduce the number of dogs relinquished to animal shelters.

<text>Srirangapatna or Srirangapattana is a town and headquarters of one of the seven Taluks of Mandya district, in the Indian State of Karnataka. It gets its name from the Ranganthaswamy temple consecrated around 984 CE. Later, under the British rule, the city was renamed to Seringapatam. Located near the city of Mandya, it is of religious, cultural and historic importance.

The monuments on the island town of Srirangapatna have been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.

==History==
Srirangapatna has since time immemorial been an urban center and place of pilgrimage. During the Vijayanagar empire, it became the seat of a major viceroyalty, from where several nearby vassal states of the empire, such as Mysore and Talakad, were overseen. When perceiving the decline of the Vijayanagar empire, the rulers of Mysore ventured to assert independence, Srirangapatna was their first target. Raja Wodeyar I vanquished Rangaraya, the then viceroy of Srirangapatna, in 1610 and celebrated the &quot;Navaratri&quot; festival in the town that year. It came to be accepted in time that two things demonstrated control and signified sovereignty over the Kingdom of Mysore by any claimant to the throne, including the successful holding of the 10-day-long &quot;Navaratri&quot; festival, dedicated to Chamundeshwari, patron goddess of Mysore and control of the fort of Srirangapatna, the fortification nearest to the capital city of Mysore.

Srirangapatna remained part of the Kingdom of Mysore from 1610 to after India&#x27;s independence in 1947; as the fortress closest to the capital city of Mysore, it was the last bastion and defence of the kingdom in case of invasion.

Srirangapatna became the capital of Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. When Tipu finally dispensed with the charade of deference to the Wodeyar Maharaja who was actually his captive, and proclaimed the &quot;Khudadad State&quot; under his own kingship, though the then incumbent Wodeyar scion Chamaraja Wodeyar IX was still officially the king of Mysore.

During Tipu Sultan&#x27;s wars against the British, Kodavas, and Malabar rajas; he rounded up entire communities of Nairs, Kodavas, and Mangalorean Catholics in the conquered regions and deported them to Srirangapatna, where they were held in bondage until they received freedom from captivity as a result of Tipu&#x27;s defeat by the British in 1799.

===Treaty of Seringapatam, 1792===

The Treaty of Seringapatam (also called Srirangapatna), signed 18 March 1792, ended the Third Anglo-Mysore War. Its signatories included Lord Cornwallis on behalf of the British East India Company, representatives of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Maratha Empire, and Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore.

===Battle of Seringapatam, 1799===

Srirangapatna was the scene of the last and decisive battle of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, fought in 1799 between Tipu Sultan, ruler of Mysore, and a combined force of 50,000 men provided equally by the Nizam of Hyderabad and the East India Company, under the overall command of General George Harris.

At the battle&#x27;s climax, Tipu Sultan was killed within the fort of Seringapatam, betrayed by one of his own confidants. The spot where he fell is today marked by a memorial. Although the joint forces of the victorious army plundered Seringapatam and ransacked Tipu&#x27;s palace, much of the site of the battle is still intact, including the ramparts, the Water Gate, the area where British prisoners were held, and the site of the destroyed palace.

Apart from the usual gold and cash, innumerable other valuables were shipped to England, including &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; and personal possessions of Tipu Sultan such as his rich clothing, shoes, sword, and firearms. Most of these remain in the British Royal Collection and in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the latter of which holds Tipu&#x27;s Tiger, an automaton of a tiger on top of a British soldier. The sword of Tipu Sultan was purchased at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction by Vijay Mallya, a liquor baron from Karnataka.

British composer Harriet Wainwright composed a work for chorus (&quot;Seringapatam&quot;) about the battle.

==Location==
Although situated only from Mysore city, Srirangapatna lies in the neighbouring district of Mandya. The entire town is enclosed by the river Kaveri to form a river island, the northern half of which is shown in the adjacent image. While the main river flows on the eastern side of the island, the &quot;Paschima Vaahini&quot; segment of the same river flows to its west. The town is easily accessible by train from Bengaluru and Mysore and is also well-connected by road, lying as it does just off the Bangalore-Mysore National Highway 275. The highway passes through this town and special care was taken to minimize any impact on the monuments.

==Religious significance==
The town takes its name from the celebrated Ranganathaswamy temple which dominates the town, making Srirangapatna one of the most important Vaishnavite centers of pilgrimage in South India. The temple was built by the Ganga dynasty rulers of the area in the 9th century; the structure was strengthened and improved upon architecturally some three centuries later. Thus, the temple is a medley of the Hoysala and Vijayanagar styles of temple architecture.

Tradition holds that all the islands formed in the Kaveri River are consecrated to Sri Ranganathaswamy (PrabhaVishnu mentioned in Vishnu Sahasranama) and large temples have been built in very ancient times dedicated to that deity on the three largest islands. The Srirangapatna temple is one of the three temples of the God Ranganatha (Adi Ranga) that are situated in the natural islands formed in the Kaveri river. They are:

*Adi Ranga: the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangapatna, Srirangapatna taluk, Mandya district, Karnataka, India
*Madhya Ranga: the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Shivanasamudra, Kollegala taluk, Chamarajanagara district, Karnataka, India
*Antya Ranga: the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam, Srirangam taluk, Tiruchirappalli district, Tamil Nadu, India

The presence of the Kaveri River is in itself considered auspicious and sanctifying. The &quot;Paschima Vaahini&quot; section of the Kaveri at Srirangapatna is considered especially sacred; the pious come from far and wide to immerse the ashes of the departed and perform obsequies to their ancestors in these waters.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 India Census Data, Srirangapatna had a population of 155,130 persons. Males constitute 50.06% and females constitute 49.93% of the total population. 9.80% of the population are under 6 years of age.


==Geography==

===Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple===
The Ranganthaswamy Temple – usually referred to as &quot;Sri Ranganathaswamy&quot; – is dedicated to Ranganatha, a manifestation of Vishnu. It is one of the five important pilgrimage sites along the river Kaveri for devotees of Ranganatha. These five sacred sites are together known as &quot;Pancharanga Kshetrams&quot; in Southern India. Since Srirangapatna is the first temple starting from upstream, the deity is known as Adi Ranga (lit; &quot;first Ranga&quot;), and the town of Srirangapatna, which derives its name from the temple, is on an island in the river Kaveri.

===Daria Daulat Bagh===
The &quot;Dariya Daulat Palace&quot; (Summer Palace) is set amidst beautiful gardens called Daria Daulat Bagh. Tippu Sultan built this palace in 1784. The palace is built in the Indo-Saracenic style is mostly made of teakwood. The palace has a rectangular plan and is built on a raised platform.

Other attractions in Srirangapatna include the &quot;Jama Masjid&quot; (a Mosque) and the Dariya Daulat Gardens. The mosque has stone Arabic inscriptions which mention the 99 titles given to the almighty Allah, and the Farsi inscription which mentions that the Masjid was built in AD 1782 by Tipu Sultan.

===Tipu Sultan Gumbaz===
The &quot;Gumbaz&quot; is an impeccably detailed mausoleum and houses the remains of Tipu Sultan, his father Hyder Ali and his mother Fatima Begum among beautifully manicured gardens. Various tombs of other relatives surround the &quot;gumbaz&quot;, some with small signs offering guidance on which specific individuals are buried here. The outer &quot;gumbaz&quot; columns are made of amphibolite, a very dark rock that exudes a somber richness. Handcrafted door frames covered in a deep lacquer finish lead into an inner tomb illuminated only by natural light. All visitors are welcome inside, and even encouraged to enter by the friendly doormen.

===Wellesley Bridge===
Wellesley Bridge was erected by Kingdom of Mysore&#x27;s Dewan, Purnaiah on the Kaveri river in 1804. It was named after the then Governor General Marquis of Wellesley. The bridge is built of stone pillars and stone corbels and surrounded by stone girders. The bridge is very strong and has survived the heavy traffic of many years.

===Karighatta viewpoint===
The Karighatta viewpoint gives good panorama of Mysore and Srirangapatna cities from a height of 3,000 feet. Karighatta is a hill a few kilometres outside the &#x27;island&#x27; town of Srirangapatna. The name Karighatta translates to &quot;Black Hill&quot; in Kannada. The hill supports the dry scrub jungle and many tamarind and gooseberry trees are found around the temple. A small river, Lokapavani, a tributary of Kaveri flows by the hill. The main entrance to the temple, with huge wooden doors opens into a large quadrangle, which is the main shrine for Vaikunta Srinivasa in black stone, flanked by Yoga Srinivasa (without his consort) and Bhoga Srinivasa idols. The hill may be climbed by stone steps (450 in number). A winding paved road is used for vehicular transport. The stone steps lead to a flat hilltop where the temple stands. The hillock has a superb panoramic view of Srirangapatna and Mysore. The beautiful landscape around the hill and the confluence of the Kaveri and Lokapavani rivers can be seen from atop the hill.

===Nimishamba Temple===
The famous Nimishamba (the incarnation of Parvathi, the goddess wife of Lord Shiva) temple is on the bank of the Lokapavani river. This temple too can be clearly seen from the top of the Karighatta hill. It is a belief that Parvathi will clear all the problems and troubles of her devotees within a minute (&quot;nimisha&quot; in Sanskrit), and hence the name.

===Garrison Cemetery, Srirangapatna===

The Garrison Cemetery is located in Srirangapatna, on the banks of the river Cauvery, about 300m from the Bangalore Mysore Highway. It has about 307 graves of the European officers killed in the final assault on Tippu Sultan in 1799, and their family members. Among the graves, there are 80 graves of the officers of the Swiss Regiment de Meuron, and the rest of the graves are their family members.

===Scott’s Bungalow, Seringapatam===

The Scott’s Bungalow is located in Seringapatam on the banks of the river Cauvery, at about half a mile from the Mysore Gate of the Seringapatam gate. The bungalow was the residence of Col. Scott, an officer of the Madras Army who took part in the siege of Seringapatam in 1799. The bungalow is associated with the legend and tragedy of Col. Scott. The story of Scott’s Bungalow is lamented in a poem by Walter Yeldham called &quot;The Deserted Bungalow&quot;, published in 1875.

===Lord Harris&#x27;s House===
Between the Garrison Cemetery and Scott’s Bungalow a path leads to Lord Harris&#x27;s House on the river banks. This house is known as &quot;Lord Harris&#x27;s House&quot; or &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Bungalow&quot; or &quot;Puraniah&#x27;s Bungalow&quot;. This house was the residence of General Harris, for a short time after the siege of Seringapatam in 1799, and went on to become headquarters of the commanding officer of Seringapatam. In 1809, the house was the scene of a mutiny by officers of the Madras Army, led by Col. Bell, against Sir. George Barlow, the Governor of Madras. Purnaiah, lived in this house after his retirement from service in 1811, and died there on 28 March 1812. A tablet on the wall records the connection of Lord Harris and Puraniah to the house.
===Srirangapatna Fort===

The fortress is in the west of the island, and is surrounded by double walls. The point at which the British broke through the walls, and thus Tipu Sultan&#x27;s troops surprised, is marked by an obelisk. Also highlighted is the place where Tipu Sultan was killed by the British forces. In addition, the dungeon in which the Mysore rulers had imprisoned British soldiers.

===Colonel Bailey&#x27;s Dungeon ===

Colonel Bailey&#x27;s Dungeon was the place where Tipu Sultan used to imprison all the British officers. It is near the death place memorial of Tipu Sultan and is surrounded by gardens on all four sides. Bailey was the only British officer who died in that place and could not make it through the tough conditions and so it was later named after him.

Another version says that the commanding officer of the British at the Battle of Pollilur (1780), Col. Baillie, was imprisoned here after the defeat of his troops in the First Mysore War.
===Obelisk Monument ===

Obelisk in Srirangapatna is a memorial erected by the then government of Mysore in memory of the English soldiers died during the siege of Srirangapatna. The Memorial was built during the reign of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV in 1907, to celebrate the defeat of Tipu in 1799. The inscription on the plaque reads &quot;This monument is erected by the government of Mysore in 1907 in order to commemorate the siege of Seringapatam by the British forces under lieutenant general G. Harris (George Harris, 1st Baron Harris) and its final capture by assault on 4 May 1799. As also the names of those gallant officers who fell during the operations.&quot;

===Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary===

Near the town is the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, where several bird species breed, including the painted stork, open-billed stork, black-headed ibis, river tern, great stone plover and Indian shag.

<text>An animal shelter or pound is a place where stray, lost, abandoned or surrendered animals – mostly dogs and cats – are housed. The word &quot;pound&quot; has its origins in the animal pounds of the agricultural communities, where stray livestock would be penned or impounded until they were claimed by their owners.

While no-kill shelters exist, it is sometimes policy to euthanize animals that are not claimed quickly enough by a previous or new owner. In Europe, of the 30 countries included in a survey, all but six (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy and Poland) permitted euthanizing non-adopted animals.
==Terminology==
The shelter industry has terminology for their unique field of work, and though there are no exact standards for consistent definitions, many words have meanings based on their usage.

&quot;Animal control&quot; has the municipal function of picking up stray dogs and cats, and investigating reports of animal abuse, dog bites or animal attacks. It may also be called &quot;animal care and control&quot;, and earlier was called the &quot;dog catcher&quot; or &quot;rabies control&quot;. Stray, lost or abandoned pets picked up off the streets are usually transported to the local animal shelter, or &quot;pound&quot;. Uncomplicated stray cases are usually kept for a period of time, called &quot;stray hold&quot;. After the holding period, an animal is considered forfeited by its owner, and may become available for adoption. Animals involved in attacks or bites are placed in quarantine and are not available for adoption until investigations or legal cases are resolved. Animal control&#x27;s interest is mainly public safety and rabies control.

Many shelter policies allow individuals to bring in animals to the shelter, often called &quot;owner surrender&quot;, or &quot;relinquishing&quot; an animal. An &quot;open admission shelter&quot; will accept any animal regardless of reason, and is usually a municipal-run shelter or a private shelter with a contract to operate for a municipality. Municipal shelters may limit incoming animals to those from the area in which they serve. A &quot;managed admission shelter&quot; requires an appointment and will restrict admission of animals to fit their available resources. &quot;Limited admission shelters&quot; are usually private or non-profit shelters without municipal contracts, and they may limit their intake to only highly-adoptable and healthy animals.

An animal in a shelter has four outcomes: return to owner, adoption, transfer to another shelter or rescue facility, or euthanasia. &quot;Return to owner&quot; is when a stray animal, that was found and housed at the shelter, is picked up by its owner. Most animal shelters practice adoption, where an animal in their care is given or sold to an individual who will keep it and care for it. Some shelters work with rescue organizations, giving an animal to the rescue rather than adopting it to an individual. Some jurisdictions mandate that shelters cooperate with rescues; some shelters utilize rescues to offload animals with health or behavior problems that they are not equipped to deal with. Many shelters practice some level of euthanasia.

Euthanasia is the act of putting an animal to death. A &quot;high kill shelter&quot; euthanizes many of the animals they take in; a &quot;low kill shelter&quot; euthanizes few animals and usually operates programs to increase the number of animals that are released alive. A shelter&#x27;s &quot;live release rate&quot; is the measure of how many animals leave a shelter alive compared to the number of animals they have taken in. A &quot;no kill shelter&quot; practices a very strict high live release rate, such as 90%, 95%, or even 100%. Since there is no standard of measurement, some shelters compare live releases to the number of healthy, &quot;adoptable animals&quot;, while others compare live releases to every animal they took in – as such, the terms high kill, low kill, and no kill are therefore subjective.

&quot;Shelter partners&quot; include rescue groups, fosters and sanctuaries. &quot;Rescue groups&quot; will often &quot;pull&quot; dogs from shelters, helping to reduce the number of animals at a shelter. A rescue group often specializes in a specific dog breed, or they pull hard-to-adopt animals such as those with health or behavioral issues with the intention of rehabilitating the animal for a future adoption. Many rescues don&#x27;t have brick and mortar locations but operate out of a home or with foster partners. A &quot;foster&quot; will temporarily take animals from the shelter to their home to give them special attention or care, such as a newly whelped litter of puppies, or an animal recovering from an illness. An &quot;animal sanctuary&quot; is an alternative to euthanasia for difficult-to-adopt animals; it is a permanent placement which may include secure kenneling and care by staff experienced in the handling of animals with serious aggression or permanent behavioral problems, or a home for aged animals that will be cared for until their natural death. Adoption and sending to rescue or sanctuary are permanent placements; fostering is a temporary placement.

A &quot;retail rescue&quot; takes advantage of right-of-first-choice of the free or cheap inventory of animals from shelters to flip shelter-pulled animals under the banner of &#x27;adoption&#x27;, with little or no retraining or veterinary care in between pulling a dog and selling it. They may also obtain animals cheaply from auctions or puppy mills and command high dollar for their adoptions under the ruse of having &#x27;rescued&#x27; the animal. A &quot;retail shelter&quot; operates like an ordinary animal shelter but with more of the flavor of a pet store than a traditional shelter by selling pet supplies. They may even obtain animals from out of the area to increase their inventory of animals, rather than serving only their geographic service area.

Many shelters routinely spay or neuter all their adoptable animals and vaccinate them for rabies and other routine pet diseases. Shelters often offer &quot;rabies clinics&quot; or &quot;spay-neuter clinics&quot; to their local public at discount rates. Some shelters participate in trap–neuter–return programs where stray animals are captured, neutered and vaccinated, then returned to the location they were picked up.

==By country==

=== Canada===
In Quebec, there are two types of animal shelters:
* SPCA (in French, &#x27;Société pour la prévention de la cruauté envers les animaux&#x27;)
* SPA (in French, &#x27;Société protectrice des animaux&#x27;)

===Germany===
Larger cities in Germany have a city shelter (Tierheim) for animals or contract with one of the many non-profit animal organizations in the country, which run their own shelters. Most shelters are populated by dogs, cats, and a variety of small animals like mice, rats, and rabbits. Additionally, there are so-called &quot;Gnadenhöfe&quot; (&quot;mercy-farms&quot;) for larger animals that take cattle or horses from private owners who want to put them down for financial reasons.

The Animal Protection Act prohibits killing of vertebrates without a proper reason. Generally, proper reasons are slaughtering or hunting for food production (cats and dogs are excepted from that), control of infectious diseases, painless killing &quot;if continued life would imply uncurable pain or suffering&quot; or if an animal poses a danger to the general public. The latter will be a reason for euthanasia only if an authority concerned with public safety orders it based on an investigation. Because of the ruling, all German animal shelters are practically no-kill shelters. Facilities must be led by a person who is certified in the handling of animals. Most shelters contract veterinarians to provide medical care.

===India===
Goshalas are a type of shelter for homeless, unwanted or elderly cattle in India. Cows are venerated by many Hindus and slaughter of cattle is illegal in most places in the country.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, dog pounds are run by each territorial local authority, which provide animal control services under the Dog Control Act 1996.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, it is allowed to euthanize animals in shelters only because of illness. However, it is permitted to kill blind litters as they are considered dependent. 

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, animal shelters are more commonly known as rescue or rehoming centres and are run by charitable organizations. The most prominent rescue and rehoming organizations are the RSPCA, Cats Protection and the Dogs Trust.

===United States===

In the United States there is no government-run organization that provides oversight or regulation of the various shelters on a national basis. However, many individual states regulate shelters within their jurisdiction. One of the earliest comprehensive measures was the &quot;Georgia Animal Protection Act&quot; of 1986, a law enacted in response to the inhumane treatment of companion animals by a pet store chain in Atlanta. It provided for the licensing and regulation of pet shops, stables, kennels, and animal shelters, and it established, for the first time, minimum standards of care. The Georgia Department of Agriculture was tasked with licensing animal shelters and enforcing the new law through the Department&#x27;s newly created Animal Protection Division. An additional provision, added in 1990, was the &quot;Humane Euthanasia Act&quot;, the first state law to mandate intravenous injection of sodium pentothal in place of gas chambers and other less humane methods. The law was further expanded and strengthened with the Animal Protection Act of 2000.

Currently, it is estimated that there are approximately 5,000 independently-run animal shelters operating nationwide. Shelters have redefined their role since the 1990s. No longer serving as a lifelong repository for strays and drop-offs, modern shelters have taken the lead in controlling the pet population, promoting pet adoption and studying shelter animals&#x27; health and behavior. To prevent animal euthanization, some shelters offer behavioral assessments of animals and training classes to make them more adoptable to the public. Most shelters also provide medical care that includes spaying and neutering to prevent overpopulation.

Shelters and shelter-like volunteer organizations responded to cat overpopulation with trap-neuter-return (TNR) programs, which reduced feral cat populations and reduced the burden on shelters.

In the United States, many government-run animal shelters operate in conditions that are far from ideal. In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, many government shelters ran out of adequate space and financial resources. Shelters unable to raise additional funds to provide for the increased number of incoming animals have no choice but to euthanize them, sometimes within days. In 2012, approximately four million cats and dogs died in U.S. shelters. However, recent years have seen a dramatic drop in the number of animals euthanized in shelters, due mainly to a successful push to promote spaying and neutering of pets.

<doc id="258719" wikidata="Q2182559" url="?curid=258719" title="Puppy mill">
<text>A puppy mill, also known as a puppy farm, is a commercial dog breeding facility characterized by quick breeding and poor conditions. Although no standardized legal definition for &quot;puppy mill&quot; exists, a definition was established in &quot;Avenson v. Zegart&quot; in 1984 as &quot;a dog breeding operation in which the health of the dogs is disregarded to maintain a low overhead and maximize profits&quot;. They are cited as being a result of increased demand for household pets, especially after World War II. The Veterinary Medical Association of the Humane Society of the United States defines the main characteristics of a puppy mill as &quot;emphasis on quantity over quality, indiscriminate breeding, continuous confinement, lack of human contact and environmental enrichment, poor husbandry, and minimal to no veterinary care.&quot;

There are an estimated 10,000 licensed and unlicensed puppy mills in the United States, in total selling more than 2,000,000 puppies annually. In these puppy mills, breeding dogs are often subjected to living the entirety of their lives in cages, which are cramped and uncomfortable for the dog. An estimated 500,000 dogs are kept solely for the purpose of breeding in puppy mills.

== Background ==
The socialization period in a puppy occurs between the ages of 4 weeks and up to 14 weeks of age. This period is crucial for adult development as almost all adult abilities are learned during this stage. With puppy mills essentially skipping the process of socialization, the result is often social problems when the puppy matures to adulthood.

== Conditions in puppy mills ==
The ASPCA states that some puppy mills can have up to 1,000 dogs under one roof. Because of the high volume of animals, the mill runner will often resort to housing them in wire cages. This results in the animals having poor locomotion. Keeping dogs in wire kennels can lead to injury and damage to the dogs&#x27; paws and legs. It&#x27;s also fairly common for these kennels to be stacked on top of each other in columns. The conditions in these mills are so unsanitary that the animals are often coated in their own urine and feces, causing mats in their fur. Due to unsanitary conditions, puppies from mills will often have internal parasites, affecting their health. Puppy mills are often unheated and this increases the number of deaths due to cold among the dogs used for breeding. Conversely, the mills can also be too hot in warmer weather leading to hyperthermia.

Other common conditions in mills include malnutrition and untreated injuries.

Due to the frequently poor breeding conditions in puppy mills, puppies bred there often suffer from health and/or social problems. Puppy mill dogs are usually housed in a small, wire cages similar to rabbit hutches and chicken coops. Puppies raised in these cramped environments shared by many other dogs become poorly socialized to other dogs and to humans. Dogs are then transported over long distances in poor conditions, sometimes resulting in animal stress and death. As the surviving mill dogs grow older, they are more prone to developing respiratory ailments and pneumonia, as well as hereditary defects such as hip dysplasia. In addition, mill dogs are more prone to having problems with their temperament due to lack of socialization, enrichment, and positive human contact. Puppies from mills are usually sold as purebred dogs in an attempt to attract the higher prices associated with purebreds. However, due to the indiscriminate breeding practices of puppy mills, the dog may not actually be a purebred puppy. A high population of puppies from mills are inbred due to uncontrolled breeding. The vast majority of puppy mill animals are sold to pet stores by &quot;dealers&quot; or &quot;brokers&quot;. Some puppies are sold by dealers masquerading as authentic breeders.

Puppy mills in the US often start with hundreds of female dogs which serve their entire lives in the establishment. The females are bred until they can no longer conceive puppies, and are often euthanized after that. The estimated number of puppies per breeding female per year is 9.4. In most puppy mills, the dogs live in cages that are only larger than the dog on all sides, which is the minimum legal size allowed. Two million puppies are bred in mills each year and almost 1.2 million dogs are euthanized in shelters every year. The conditions in puppy mills are considered inhumane because all of the dogs are in a small, dirty area which is confined with disease and bacteria. Because of the poor living conditions, dogs are often sick and malnourished. Food is often found crawling with bugs and feces is almost everywhere. Health issues that are prevalent in puppy mills consist of giardia, mange, heartworm, respiratory infections, and much more.

== History ==
Puppy mills originated in the post-World War II era. Midwestern farmers, suffering crop failures, turned to puppy farming as an alternative crop. An increasing demand for household pets resulted in the development of the &quot;commercial puppy business&quot;.

Conditions in puppy mills were well known to be poor. As a result, organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States began to investigate breeding kennels, leading to the passage of the Animal Welfare Act of August 24, 1966.

== Prevalence ==
=== United States ===
According to the Humane Society of the United States, only about 3,000 of the 10,000 puppy mills in the United States are closely monitored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This presents the possibility of significant noncompliance with federal law by owners and operators of mill operations. Puppy mills do not only affect the dogs that live in and come from them; purchases from pet stores and breeders lessen the number of adoptions from shelters, where three to four million dogs are euthanized every year.

A high concentration of both puppy mills and breeders has been reported in the states of Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri. Pennsylvania, particularly Lancaster County, has been labeled the &quot;Puppy Mill Capital of the East&quot; due to its high volume of puppy mills, and Missouri has been labeled the &quot;Puppy Mill Capital of the U.S.&quot; by animal welfare and consumer protection groups. In Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and Holmes County, Ohio, the high concentration of puppy mills is correlated with a large Amish population.

A study by the Better Business Bureau concluded that the southwest corner of Missouri is the hub of the nation&#x27;s puppy mill industry, and termed it the &quot;national hot spot of the puppy industry.&quot; The state of Missouri has around 1,600 puppy mills as of 2018.

=== Australia ===
Dog breeding is regulated by individual Australian states. There is no available data on the prevalence of puppy farms.

In 2010 the RSPCA Australia identified 12 puppy farms in the state of Queensland and estimated a similar prevalence in other Australian states.

== Hobby breeders ==
The term &quot;puppy mill&quot; has been widely used by animal rights groups in protests against breeders who have substandard breeding conditions. Critics in the breeder community claim that emotional rhetoric, sensationalism and pictures of dirty kennels are used to justify additional legislation or additional restrictive licensing that travels well beyond the initial goal of removing dogs from truly deplorable conditions, or that attempts to legislate puppy mills would put them out of business. They argue the laws requiring additional costs in updating and maintaining their facility and licensing would be detrimental to the dogs in their care. They cite existing lemon laws for puppies as sufficient protection for both dogs and prospective buyers.
== Legislative response ==

=== United States ===

In the United States, some elements of the dog breeding industry are regulated by the Animal Welfare Act of August 24, 1966.

In recent years, state legislatures have passed new laws aimed at eliminating the worst abuses at puppy mills. New laws include limits on the number of breeding females, requirements that facilities be licensed and inspected, and requirements that dogs be given proper veterinary care. Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Virginia passed puppy mill laws in 2008, and 10 states passed laws in 2009 to crack down on abusive puppy mills.

In 2010, Missouri voters passed Proposition B, the &quot;Puppy Mill Cruelty Prevention Act&quot;, which establishes minimum standards of humane care and limits breeders to 50 intact dogs.

A compromise, dubbed the &quot;Missouri Solution&quot;, was signed by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon.

Gov. Jay Nixon, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, Missouri Director of Agriculture Jon Hagler and Humane Society of Missouri President Kathy Warnick in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch state that &quot;key provisions of a compromise dog breeding law passed in April will protect animals without putting dog breeders out of business.&quot;

It retained some of the provisions of Proposition B, and made available some state funding for inspections. Humane Society of Missouri President Kathy Warnick reacted favorably, seeing a step in the right direction for animal welfare.

The Missouri Senate has a current bill SB 161 that &quot;modifies provisions relating to agriculture.&quot; Section 273.327, under the Animal Care Facilities Act states how there will be fees for dog facilities every year. On the same bill section 273.347, it states that breeders can receive penalties for animal care violations up to $1,000 and receive a class C misdemeanor.

=== Australia ===
Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has responded to the problem of puppy mills in Australia by proposing the Animals Regulation of Sale Bill. It would ban the sale of dogs through pet shops, the internet or newspapers. The aim is to crack down on impulse purchases and shut down unregistered backyard breeders. These breeders should no longer easily profit from the sale of the dogs and the number of unwanted and abandoned animals could drop.

Also recently there were a few bold initiatives to fight against puppy mills. Namely RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) strategy. Oscar&#x27;s law (The organization&#x27;s name originates from the story of a dog called Oscar, who was rescued from a puppy factory in central Victoria). and Victorian Labor Party Efforts that restrict the number of dogs per breeding facility and require that pet shop owners keep records of every dog sold.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1996, Britain passed the Breeding and Sale of Dogs Act which requires annual veterinary inspections for anyone breeding five or more litters in one year. Breeding females are restricted to one litter per year and four per lifetime.

Breeders who choose to be members of the UK Kennel Club are required to register purebred puppies for sale with that organization and must certify the conditions under which the puppies were raised. Breeders who sell puppies by misrepresenting these standards may be liable to prosecution under the Sale of Goods Act 1979.

Members of the UK public frequently buy puppies and kittens without knowing the conditions under which the animals were reared, the Blue Cross estimates from 40,000 to 80,000 puppies are sold that way per year. To prevent this a new law is planned banning the sale of puppies and kittens below the age of 6 months in England except by licensed breeders and rehoming centres. Paula Boyden, of the Dogs Trust, approves of the ban but advised, &quot;potential loopholes&quot; needed to be addressed. She maintains rehoming organisations need regulation.

Lucy&#x27;s Law, which came into effect in April 2020, is intended to prevent puppy (and kitten) farming by banning third-party sales such as in pet shops.

== Legal cases ==
&quot;Chelsea Vancleve v. Chien Et Chat, Inc.&quot; stated, &quot;In 2014, the Animal Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against Barkworks, a Southern California pet store chain with six locations.&quot; Barkworks tricked many puppy buyers into purchasing sick puppies. They were also making illegal breeder licenses, &quot;fabricating breeding certificates and lying about providing veterinary care&quot; The Animal Defense Fund made a complaint in 2015 that could have turned into a class action. The court prevented the case from going any further as a class action but in 2018, the parties agreed on a settlement. &quot;Barkworks had taken down the misleading in-store signs and closed four of its six retail stores, and the California legislature had passed a law banning the sale of dogs from commercial breeders.&quot;

The Humane Society of the United States sued the USDA on March 21, 2018, &quot;for failing to release information in the Animal Welfare Act records we requested under the Freedom of Information. The following day, Congress urged the USDA to restore the records as part of a report accompanying the agency&#x27;s 2018 spending bill. As of April 20, 2018, USDA had still not restored the records.&quot;

The ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) filed a lawsuit in 2021 against the USDA &quot;for abandoning its responsibility to enforce the Animal Welfare Act (AWA)&quot; which was put in place on August 24, 1966, to regulate the humane treatment of commercially bred dogs.&quot; The AWA requires the USDA to inspect facilities to ensure they meet the minimum requirements of care in which violators would be face penalties such as fines and license revocation. The lawsuit claims that the USDA purposefully has chosen to ignore violations which then go unreported and unpunished which has resulted in not a single penalty filed against a commercial dog dealer since 2017 despite overwhelming evidence of cruelty. It was also claimed the USDA did not act even with reported violations on record. As of 2024, the USDA has only issued four recorded punishments to commercial dog dealers out of over 1,000 violations. These commercial dog dealers were still allowed to continue operating.

<doc id="258724" wikidata="Q28108" url="?curid=258724" title="Political system">
<text>In political science, a political system means the form of political organization that can be observed, recognised or otherwise declared by a society or state.

It defines the process for making official government decisions. It usually comprizes the governmental legal and economic system, social and cultural system, and other state and government specific systems. However, this is a very simplified view of a much more complex system of categories involving the questions of who should have authority and what the government influence on its people and economy should be.

Along with a basic sociological and socio-anthropological classification, political systems can be classified on a social-cultural axis relative to the liberal values prevalent in the Western world, where the spectrum is represented as a continuum between political systems recognized as democracies, 
totalitarian regimes and, sitting between these two, authoritarian regimes, with a variety of hybrid regimes; and monarchies may be also included as a standalone entity or as a hybrid system of the main three.

== Definition ==
According to David Easton, &quot;A political system can be designated as the interactions through which values are authoritatively allocated for a society&quot;. Political system refers broadly to the process by which laws are made and public resources allocated in a society, and to the relationships among those involved in making these decisions.

== Basic classification ==

Social anthropologists generally recognize several kinds of political systems, often differentiating between ones that they consider uncentralized and ones they consider centralized.
* Uncentralized systems
** Band society
*** Small family group, no larger than an extended family or clan; it has been defined as consisting of no more than 30 to 50 individuals.
*** A band can cease to exist if only a small group walks out.
** Tribe
*** Generally larger, consisting of many families. Tribes have more social institutions, such as a chief or elders.
*** More permanent than bands. Many tribes are sub-divided into bands.
* Centralized governments
** Chiefdom
*** More complex than a tribe or a band society, and less complex than a state or a civilization
*** Characterized by pervasive inequality and centralization of authority.
*** A single lineage/family of the elite class becomes the ruling elite of the chiefdom
*** Complex chiefdoms have two or even three tiers of political hierarchy.
*** &quot;An autonomous political unit comprising a number of villages or communities under the permanent control of a paramount chief&quot;
** Sovereign state
*** A sovereign state is a state with a permanent population, a defined territory, a government and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states.
* Supranational political systems
** Supranational political systems are created by independent nations to reach a common goal or gain strength from forming an alliance.
* Empires
** Empires are widespread states consisting of people of different ethnicities under a single rule. Empires - such as the Romans, or British - often made considerable progress in ways of political structures, creating and building city infrastructures, and maintaining civility within the diverse communities. Because of the intricate organization of the empires, they were often able to hold a large majority of power on a universal level.
* Leagues
** Leagues are international organizations composed of states coming together for a single common purpose. In this way, leagues are different from empires, as they only seek to fulfill a single goal. Often leagues are formed on the brink of a military or economic downfall. Meetings and hearings are conducted in a neutral location with representatives of all involved nations present.

== Western socio-cultural paradigmatic-centric analysis ==

The sociological interest in political systems is figuring out who holds power within the relationship between the government and its people and how the government’s power is used. According to Yale professor Juan José Linz, there are three main types of political systems today: democracies, 
totalitarian regimes and, sitting between these two, authoritarian regimes (with hybrid regimes). Another modern classification system includes monarchies as a standalone entity or as a hybrid system of the main three. Scholars generally refer to a dictatorship as either a form of authoritarianism or totalitarianism.
===Democracy===

===Authoritarianism===
===Totalitarian ===
===Monarchy===
===Hybrid ===

== Marxist/Dialectical materialistic analysis ==

19th-century German-born philosopher Karl Marx analysed that the political systems of &quot;all&quot; state-societies are the &quot;dictatorship&quot; of one social class, vying for &quot;its&quot; interests &quot;against&quot; that of another one; with &quot;which&quot; class oppressing &quot;which&quot; other class being, in essence, determined by the developmental level of that society, and its repercussions implicated thereof, as the society progresses through the passage of time. In capitalist societies, this characterises as the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie or &quot;capitalist class&quot;, in which the economic and political system is designed to work in their interests collectively as a class, over those of the proletariat or &quot;working class&quot;.

Marx devised this theory by adapting his forerunner-contemporary Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#x27;s notion of dialectics into the framework of materialism.

<text>Rate of return pricing or target-return pricing is a method by which a company will set the price of its product based on their desired returns on said product. The concept of rate return pricing is very similar to return on investment, but in this circumstance the company can manipulate its prices to achieve the desired goal. This method is used primarily by companies that either have a lot of capital or have a monopoly on the market and when an investor requests a specific return on their investment. In a competitive market rate of return pricing can be a poor market strategy as its focus at the final profit margins and does not account for supply and demand factors. If a competitor is able to set a lower price, it could decrease demand for the product resulting in a lower sales then forecasted and failing to reach the desired profit margin.

== Formula ==
The formula is: Target-return pricing = unit cost + [(desired return on investment * invested capital) / expected unit sales]

== Use ==
Rate of return pricing enables firms to better assess the profitability of a product or service. It enables the cost of invested capital to be accounted when the setting price per unit and can be used to forecast the end monetary return of an exercise. It also helps the company in reaching certain profit goals&#x27; while maintaining liquidity. Additionally, if market conditions are stable, forecasts for returns will be extremely accurate as a certain target is being used in pricing achievements are solely dependent on sales.

<text>The American President is a 1995 American political romantic comedy drama film directed and produced by Rob Reiner and written by Aaron Sorkin. The film stars Michael Douglas as President Andrew Shepherd, a widower who pursues a romantic relationship with environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening) – who has just moved to Washington, D.C. – while at the same time attempting to win the passage of a crime control bill during a re-election year. Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox and Richard Dreyfuss star in supporting roles.

&quot;The American President&quot; grossed $107.9 million on a budget of $62 million, and was praised by critics for its performances (especially Douglas’s and Bening’s), musical score, story, and screenplay. The film earned composer Marc Shaiman a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score. The film was nominated for 5 Golden Globes: Best Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Actor – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress – Musical or Comedy, and Best Screenplay. In 2002, the American Film Institute ranked &quot;The American President&quot; No. 75 on its list of America&#x27;s Greatest Love Stories.

== Plot ==

Popular Democratic U.S. President Andrew Shepherd prepares to run for re-election. The president and his staff, led by Chief of Staff and best friend MacInerney, attempt to consolidate the administration&#x27;s 63% approval rating by passing a moderate crime control bill. However, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: conservatives reject it, and liberals think it is too weak. If passed, however, Shepherd&#x27;s re-election is presumed to be guaranteed. Shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and have the Congressional support to pass it, by his State of the Union Address.

When the widowed President&#x27;s cousin Judith is sick and unable to act as hostess at a state dinner for the French president, Shepherd realizes his staff&#x27;s public portrayal of him as lonely widower is true. Soon after, Shepherd meets and is attracted to Sydney Ellen Wade, a lawyer employed by an environmental lobbying firm working to pass legislation to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions. He invites Sydney to act as hostess (and his date) at the state dinner, where she charms the guests and shares a dance with Andy.

During a meeting, Shepherd strikes a deal with Wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill before his State of the Union Address, he will deliver the last ten. MacInerney believes Wade will fail to obtain enough votes, thus releasing Shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass.

Shepherd and Wade begin seeing each other and fall in love. Republican presidential hopeful Senator Bob Rumson steps up his attacks, focusing on Wade&#x27;s activist past and maligning Shepherd&#x27;s ethics and family values. The President&#x27;s refusal to refute Rumson&#x27;s aspersions lowers his approval ratings and erodes crucial political support that threatens the crime bill.

Wade is dejected after her failed meeting with three Michigan congressmen to discuss the environmental bill. When she tells Shepherd about the meeting, she inadvertently mentions that the congressmen want to defeat both the President&#x27;s crime bill and Wade&#x27;s environmental bill. Shepherd and MacInerney are conflicted about how they obtained this sensitive information. However, they are unable to ignore the opportunity to pass the crime bill, even if it means the President going back on his deal with Wade.

Eventually, Wade secures enough votes for the environmental bill while Shepherd is three short. He can only obtain them by shelving the environmental bill to solidify the three Michigan congressmen&#x27;s votes for the crime bill which he agrees to do.

Wade&#x27;s firm fires her for failing to achieve their objectives and for seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation. She goes to see Shepherd to end their relationship and says she has a job opportunity in Hartford, Connecticut. While he defends the crime bill as his top priority, she criticizes it as weakly worded with little chance of preventing crime.

Prior to the State of the Union Address, Shepherd makes a surprise appearance in the White House press room and rebukes Rumson&#x27;s attacks on his values and character, as well as his relentless innuendos that Wade prostituted herself for political favors. He declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to Congress with a massive 20% cut in fossil fuels – far more than the 10% originally proposed. Furthermore, he is withdrawing the crime bill for a stronger one with significant gun control measures.

Shepherd&#x27;s passion galvanizes the press and his staff. Shepherd and Wade reconcile, then she walks him to the doors of the House chamber where he enters to thunderous applause as he is about to deliver the State of the Union Address.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
Originally, actor Robert Redford approached a number of screenwriters with the single-line premise, &quot;the president elopes&quot;. Sorkin, on the basis of his treatment, was selected by Redford to write the screenplay with Redford attached to star. Emma Thompson turned down the role of Sydney Wade. When Rob Reiner was brought aboard to direct, Redford dropped out. At the time, in October 1994, with cameras set to roll on November 30 of that year, Redford&#x27;s publicist attributed his decision to his desire &quot;to do a love story, but (Reiner) wanted to do something that was ultimately about politics&quot;. Other sources suggested that Redford and Reiner &quot;didn&#x27;t get along...It was a personality thing.&quot;

In later interviews, writer Aaron Sorkin told &quot;TV Guide&quot; he wrote the screenplay while high on crack cocaine while he was living at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, which is why it took him three years to complete it.

An extensive White House set, of both the East and West Wings, was built on the Castle Rock Entertainment lot in Culver City. The set&#x27;s Oval Office was later reused for the films &quot;Nixon&quot; and &quot;Independence Day.&quot;

=== Lawsuit ===
William Richert sued the Writers Guild of America over not being credited on the screenplay of the film. Richert claimed Sorkin&#x27;s screenplay was a thinly veiled plagiarism of Richert&#x27;s 1981 screenplay &quot;The President Elopes&quot;. After Guild arbitration, Sorkin was awarded full credit on &quot;The American President&quot;. Richert also claimed that the television series &quot;The West Wing&quot; was derived from part of the same screenplay.

==Release==
&quot;The American President&quot; grossed $60.1 million in the United States, and $47.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $107.9 million.

The film grossed $10 million in its opening weekend (finishing third), $9.7 million in its second weekend, and $5.3 million in its third (finishing sixth both times).

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The American President&quot; has an approval rating of 91% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A charming romantic comedy with political bite, Rob Reiner&#x27;s &quot;The American President&quot; features strong lead performances and some poignant observations of politics and media in the 1990s.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

It received praise and &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot; from Siskel and Ebert who were surprised by how good the film was, considering Reiner&#x27;s previous film, &quot;North&quot;, was chosen by both critics for the worst movie of the year. Ebert said after detesting &quot;North&quot;, he was very happy and pleased to give Reiner&#x27;s next film a unanimously positive review. Siskel praised Douglas and Bening for their performances.

== Legacy ==
=== Influence on &quot;The West Wing&quot; ===
The screenplay for the film inspired many aspects of Sorkin&#x27;s later television drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. The two productions follow the staff of a largely idealized White House, and like many of Sorkin&#x27;s projects, share ideologies.

The film&#x27;s influence can be seen most clearly in early episodes of the series; some dialogue in the two are nearly identical. Sorkin has been known to say that much of the first season was actually taken from material he edited out of the first draft of &quot;The American President&quot; script.

One of the issues touched on in the film and developed in the series relates to gun control bills, developed in &quot;Five Votes Down&quot;. While the bill is ultimately withdrawn by President Shepherd because it is ineffectual, on the series President Bartlet and his staff work hard to pass their bill even though it is badly flawed (and end up doubly unhappy when VP John Hoynes, whom the President and senior staff are feuding with, clinches the bill for them by persuading an influential southern Democrat to support it).

More significant is the issue of a &quot;proportional response&quot; to military attacks on American assets abroad. In &quot;The American President&quot;, Andrew Shepherd finds himself in the Situation Room having to order such an attack against Libya&#x27;s intelligence headquarters after they bombed a missile defense system called &quot;C-STAD&quot; (Capricorn Surface-to-Air Defense) which had been positioned by the U.S. in Israel. He muses for a single line &quot;Someday, someone&#x27;s gonna have to explain to me the virtue of a proportional response&quot;, before giving the order. In &quot;A Proportional Response&quot;, President Bartlet finds himself in similar circumstances (Syrian intelligence shot down a U.S. plane in Jordan and killed numerous Americans, including a young Naval officer whom the President had decided would be his personal physician) and, seated in the White House Situation Room with his own National Security Council asks: &quot;What is the virtue of a proportional response?&quot; In both cases, the President chooses a military response that is relatively measured, but in the movie President Shepherd never considers a &quot;disproportionate&quot; response while President Bartlet plans such an action to destroy a large civilian airport in Syria; he eventually gives the green light for a strike similar to the one used in the movie.

The Global Defense Council, the fictional environmental lobby where Sydney Wade worked, is also featured in the &quot;West Wing&quot; episode called &quot;The Drop-In&quot;, and is often referred to in other episodes.

In &quot;The American President&quot;, Sydney Ellen Wade is ultimately fired from her lobbyist position because the president has brokered a deal that causes her legislative effort to fail. Similarly, in the final episode of the third season of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman uses the same tactic and ends up getting Amy Gardner fired from her position at the Women&#x27;s Leadership Conference. Josh and Amy are dating when this takes place, just as the main characters are here. However, on the TV series it is Amy who tries to scuttle a bill (welfare reform) and Josh refuses to accept the demands of three Republican Congressmen because they amount to blackmail.

&quot;The American President&quot; includes mention of a Governor Stackhouse, while there is a Minnesota senator Howard Stackhouse (George Coe) in the &quot;West Wing&quot; episodes &quot;The Stackhouse Filibuster&quot; and &quot;The Red Mass&quot;. In the same way, the French President attending a state dinner in &quot;The American President&quot; seems to be the same President d&#x27;Astier often referred to in &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

Several actors from &quot;The American President&quot; reappear in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, including Martin Sheen (whose character in &quot;The American President&quot;, A.J., is at one point accused by Shepherd of lacking the courage to run for office himself) as President Josiah Bartlet, Anna Deavere Smith as National Security Advisor Dr. Nancy McNally, Joshua Malina as White House Communications Director Will Bailey, Nina Siemaszko as Ellie Bartlet, Ron Canada as Under Secretary of State Theodore Barrow, and Thom Barry as Congressman Mark Richardson.

Portrayals of the president as idealistic but indecisive are also similar. In &quot;The American President,&quot; Shepherd has to be convinced by his staff to stand up to his Republican opponent and pursue gun control and environmental legislation decisively. In &quot;The West Wing,&quot; Bartlet is sometimes referred to as “Uncle Fluffy” when endorsing moderate views that are more conciliatory and less resolute (for example, in the episodes “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet” and “The Two Bartlets”). More generally, both presidents are former university professors (history in the movie, economics in the show) with no military experience and a low tolerance for political expediency.

=== Further legacy ===
The concept for the television show &quot;Spin City&quot; was set in motion after the writers had seen Michael J. Fox in &quot;The American President&quot; playing one of the President&#x27;s political aides. They wanted him to play a similar character for television.

In January 2012, while criticizing then-leader of the opposition (and future Prime Minister) Tony Abbott in a speech at the National Press Club in Canberra, Australian Federal Minister (and another future Prime Minister) Anthony Albanese plagiarised several lines from &quot;The American President&quot;.

In April 2013, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Maureen Dowd drew a sharp contrast between President Obama&#x27;s unsuccessful effort to secure passage of expanded background-check legislation in the Senate, on one hand, and the all-out vote-gathering effort in &quot;The American President&quot;. The President responded to the column at the 2013 White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner, noting the criticism and posing a series of rhetorical questions to Michael Douglas, who he said was in the audience, including, &quot;Could it be that you were an actor in an Aaron Sorkin liberal fantasy?&quot;

In the 2016 Presidential election candidate Ted Cruz paraphrased a portion of &quot;The American President&quot; when fellow candidate Donald Trump insulted Cruz&#x27;s wife. Cruz stated, &quot;...and if Donald wants to get into a character fight, he’s better off sticking with me because Heidi is way out of his league,” alluding to the speech President Shepherd made about Rumson&#x27;s attacks on Sydney Ellen Wade.

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute as #75 in its 2002 list of 100 Years...100 Passions.

<doc id="258733" wikidata="Q908427" url="?curid=258733" title="Knuth's up-arrow notation">
<text>In mathematics, Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation is a method of notation for very large integers, introduced by Donald Knuth in 1976.

In his 1947 paper, R. L. Goodstein introduced the specific sequence of operations that are now called &quot;hyperoperations&quot;. Goodstein also suggested the Greek names tetration, pentation, etc., for the extended operations beyond exponentiation. The sequence starts with a unary operation (the successor function with &quot;n&quot; = 0), and continues with the binary operations of addition (&quot;n&quot; = 1), multiplication (&quot;n&quot; = 2), exponentiation (&quot;n&quot; = 3), tetration (&quot;n&quot; = 4), pentation (&quot;n&quot; = 5), etc.
Various notations have been used to represent hyperoperations. One such notation is formula_1.
Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation formula_2 is another. 
For example:
* the single arrow formula_2 represents exponentiation (iterated multiplication) formula_4
* the double arrow formula_5 represents tetration (iterated exponentiation) formula_6
* the triple arrow formula_7 represents pentation (iterated tetration) formula_8
The general definition of the up-arrow notation is as follows (for formula_9):
formula_10
Here, formula_11 stands for &quot;n&quot; arrows, so for example
formula_12
The square brackets are another notation for hyperoperations.

==Introduction==
The hyperoperations naturally extend the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication as follows.
Addition by a natural number is defined as iterated incrementation:
:formula_13
Multiplication by a natural number is defined as iterated addition:
:formula_14

For example,

:formula_15

Exponentiation for a natural power formula_16 is defined as iterated multiplication, which Knuth denoted by a single up-arrow:

:formula_17

For example,

:formula_18

Tetration is defined as iterated exponentiation, which Knuth denoted by a “double arrow”:
:formula_19

For example,

:formula_20

Expressions are evaluated from right to left, as the operators are defined to be right-associative.

According to this definition,
:formula_21
:formula_22
:formula_23 
:formula_24
:etc.

This already leads to some fairly large numbers, but the hyperoperator sequence does not stop here.

Pentation, defined as iterated tetration, is represented by the “triple arrow”:
:formula_25
Hexation, defined as iterated pentation, is represented by the “quadruple arrow”:
:formula_26

and so on. The general rule is that an formula_27-arrow operator expands into a right-associative series of (formula_28)-arrow operators. Symbolically,
:formula_29

Examples:

:formula_30

:formula_31

==Notation==
In expressions such as formula_32, the notation for exponentiation is usually to write the exponent formula_16 as a superscript to the base number formula_34. But many environments — such as programming languages and plain-text e-mail — do not support superscript typesetting. People have adopted the linear notation formula_35 for such environments; the up-arrow suggests &#x27;raising to the power of&#x27;. If the character set does not contain an up arrow, the caret (^) is used instead.

The superscript notation formula_32 doesn&#x27;t lend itself well to generalization, which explains why Knuth chose to work from the inline notation formula_35 instead.

formula_38 is a shorter alternative notation for n uparrows. Thus formula_39.

===Writing out up-arrow notation in terms of powers===
Attempting to write formula_40 using the familiar superscript notation gives a power tower.

:For example: formula_41

If formula_16 is a variable (or is too large), the power tower might be written using dots and a note indicating the height of the tower.

:formula_43

Continuing with this notation, formula_44 could be written with a stack of such power towers, each describing the size of the one above it.

:formula_45

Again, if formula_16 is a variable or is too large, the stack might be written using dots and a note indicating its height.

:formula_47

Furthermore, formula_48 might be written using several columns of such stacks of power towers, each column describing the number of power towers in the stack to its left:

:formula_49

And more generally:

:formula_50

This might be carried out indefinitely to represent formula_38 as iterated exponentiation of iterated exponentiation for any formula_34, formula_27, and formula_16 (although it clearly becomes rather cumbersome).

====Using tetration====

The Rudy Rucker notation formula_55 for tetration allows us to make these diagrams slightly simpler while still employing a geometric representation (we could call these &quot;tetration towers&quot;).

: formula_56

: formula_57

: formula_58

Finally, as an example, the fourth Ackermann number formula_59 could be represented as:
: formula_60

==Generalizations==
Some numbers are so large that multiple arrows of Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation become too cumbersome; then an &quot;n&quot;-arrow operator formula_11 is useful (and also for descriptions with a variable number of arrows), or equivalently, hyper operators.

Some numbers are so large that even that notation is not sufficient. The Conway chained arrow notation can then be used: a chain of three elements is equivalent with the other notations, but a chain of four or more is even more powerful.

:formula_62
formula_63 = formula_64, Since formula_63 = formula_66 = formula_67, Thus the result comes out with formula_64

formula_69 = formula_70 or formula_71 (Petillion)

Even faster-growing functions can be categorized using an ordinal analysis called the fast-growing hierarchy. The fast-growing hierarchy uses successive function iteration and diagonalization to systematically create faster-growing functions from some base function formula_72. For the standard fast-growing hierarchy using formula_73, formula_74 already exhibits exponential growth, formula_75 is comparable to tetrational growth and is upper-bounded by a function involving the first four hyperoperators;. Then, formula_76 is comparable to the Ackermann function, formula_77 is already beyond the reach of indexed arrows but can be used to approximate Graham&#x27;s number, and formula_78 is comparable to arbitrarily-long Conway chained arrow notation.

These functions are all computable. Even faster computable functions, such as the Goodstein sequence and the TREE sequence require the usage of large ordinals, may occur in certain combinatorical and proof-theoretic contexts. There exist functions which grow uncomputably fast, such as the Busy Beaver, whose very nature will be completely out of reach from any up-arrow, or even any ordinal-based analysis.

==Definition==

Without reference to hyperoperation the up-arrow operators can be formally defined by

:formula_79
for all integers formula_80 with formula_9.

This definition uses exponentiation formula_82 as the base case, and tetration formula_83 as repeated exponentiation. This is equivalent to the hyperoperation sequence except it omits the three more basic operations of succession, addition and multiplication.

One can alternatively choose multiplication formula_84 as the base case and iterate from there. Then exponentiation becomes repeated multiplication. The formal definition would be
:formula_85
for all integers formula_80 with formula_87.

Note, however, that Knuth did not define the &quot;nil-arrow&quot; (formula_88). One could extend the notation to negative indices (n ≥ -2) in such a way as to agree with the entire hyperoperation sequence, except for the lag in the indexing:
:formula_89

The up-arrow operation is a right-associative operation, that is, formula_90 is understood to be formula_91, instead of formula_92. If ambiguity is not an issue parentheses are sometimes dropped.

==Tables of values==
===Computing 0↑&quot;n&quot; &quot;b&quot;===

Computing formula_93 results in
:0, when &quot;n&quot; = 0  
:1, when &quot;n&quot; = 1 and &quot;b&quot; = 0   
:0, when &quot;n&quot; = 1 and &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0   
:1, when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;b&quot; is even (including 0)
:0, when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;b&quot; is odd

===Computing 2↑&quot;n&quot; &quot;b&quot;===

Computing formula_94 can be restated in terms of an infinite table. We place the numbers formula_95 in the top row, and fill the left column with values 2. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken.

The table is the same as that of the Ackermann function, except for a shift in formula_27 and formula_16, and an addition of 3 to all values.

===Computing 3↑&quot;n&quot; &quot;b&quot;===

We place the numbers formula_98 in the top row, and fill the left column with values 3. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken.

===Computing 4↑&quot;n&quot; &quot;b&quot;===

We place the numbers formula_99 in the top row, and fill the left column with values 4. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken.

===Computing 10↑&quot;n&quot; &quot;b&quot;===

We place the numbers formula_100 in the top row, and fill the left column with values 10. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken.

For 2 ≤ &quot;b&quot; ≤ 9 the numerical order of the numbers formula_101 is the lexicographical order with &quot;n&quot; as the most significant number, so for the numbers of these 8 columns the numerical order is simply line-by-line. The same applies for the numbers in the 97 columns with 3 ≤ &quot;b&quot; ≤ 99, and if we start from &quot;n&quot; = 1 even for 3 ≤ &quot;b&quot; ≤ 9,999,999,999.

<text>John Lawrence Ashbery (July 28, 1927 – September 3, 2017) was an American poet and art critic.

Ashbery is considered the most influential American poet of his time. Oxford University literary critic John Bayley wrote that Ashbery &quot;sounded, in poetry, the standard tones of the age.&quot; Langdon Hammer, chair of the English Department at Yale University, wrote in 2008, &quot;No figure looms so large in American poetry over the past 50 years as John Ashbery&quot; and &quot;No American poet has had a larger, more diverse vocabulary, not Whitman, not Pound.&quot; Stephanie Burt, a poet and Harvard professor of English, has compared Ashbery to T. S. Eliot, calling Ashbery &quot;the last figure whom half the English-language poets alive thought a great model, and the other half thought incomprehensible&quot;.

Ashbery published more than 20 volumes of poetry. Among other awards, he received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, National Book Award, National Book Critics Circle Award for his collection &quot;Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror&quot; (1975). In 2007, he became the first living poet to be anthologized by the Library of America. Renowned for its postmodern complexity and opacity, his work still proves controversial. Ashbery said he wished his work to be accessible to as many people as possible, not a private dialogue with himself. He also joked that some critics still view him as &quot;a harebrained, homegrown surrealist whose poetry defies even the rules and logic of Surrealism.&quot; He reflected: &quot;I’m not very good at explaining my work... I&#x27;m unable to do so because I feel that my poetry is the explanation. The explanation of what? Of my thought, whatever that is. As I see it, my thought is both poetry and the attempt to explain that poetry; the two cannot be disentangled.&quot;

==Life==
Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Helen (née Lawrence), a biology teacher, and Chester Frederick Ashbery, a farmer. He was raised on a farm near Lake Ontario; his brother died when they were children. Ashbery was educated at Deerfield Academy, an all-boys school, where he read such poets as W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas and began writing poetry. Two of his poems were published in &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine by a classmate who had submitted them under his own name, without Ashbery&#x27;s knowledge or permission. Ashbery also published a piece of short fiction and a handful of poems—including a sonnet about his frustrated love for a fellow student—in the school newspaper, the &quot;Deerfield Scroll&quot;. His first ambition was to be a painter: from the age of 11 until he was 15, Ashbery took weekly classes at the art museum in Rochester.
Ashbery graduated in 1949 with an A.B., &quot;cum laude&quot;, from Harvard College, where he was a member of the &quot;Harvard Advocate&quot;, the university&#x27;s literary magazine, and the Signet Society. He wrote his senior thesis on the poetry of W. H. Auden. At Harvard he befriended fellow writers Kenneth Koch, Barbara Epstein, V. R. Lang, Frank O&#x27;Hara and Edward Gorey, and was a classmate of Robert Creeley, Robert Bly and Peter Davison. Ashbery went on to study briefly at New York University before receiving an M.A. from Columbia University in 1951.

After working as a copywriter in New York from 1951 to 1955, from the mid-1950s, when he received a Fulbright Fellowship, through 1965, Ashbery lived in France. He was an editor of the 12 issues of &quot;Art and Literature&quot; (1964–67) and the &quot;New Poetry&quot; issue of Harry Mathews&#x27; &quot;Locus Solus&quot; (# 3/4; 1962). To make ends meet he translated French murder mysteries, served as the art editor for the European edition of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and was an art critic for &quot;Art International&quot; (1960–65) and a Paris correspondent for &quot;ARTnews&quot; (1963–66), when Thomas Hess took over as editor. During this period he lived with the French poet Pierre Martory, whose books &quot;Every Question but One&quot; (1990), &quot;The Landscape is behind the Door&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Landscapist&quot; he translated (2008), as he did Arthur Rimbaud (&quot;Illuminations&quot;), Max Jacob (&quot;The Dice Cup&quot;), Pierre Reverdy (&quot;Haunted House&quot;), and many titles by Raymond Roussel. After returning to the United States, he continued his career as an art critic for &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazines while also serving on the editorial board of &quot;ARTnews&quot; until 1972. Several years later, he began a stint as an editor at &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, serving from 1976 to 1980.

During the fall of 1963, Ashbery became acquainted with Andy Warhol at a scheduled poetry reading at the Literary Theatre in New York. He had previously written favorable reviews of Warhol&#x27;s art. That same year he reviewed Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Flowers&quot; exhibition at Galerie Ileana Sonnabend in Paris, describing Warhol&#x27;s visit to Paris as &quot;the biggest transatlantic fuss since Oscar Wilde brought culture to Buffalo in the nineties&quot;. Ashbery returned to New York near the end of 1965 and was welcomed with a large party at the Factory. He became close friends with poet Gerard Malanga, Warhol&#x27;s assistant, on whom he had an important influence as a poet. In 1967 his poem &quot;Europe&quot; was used as the central text in Eric Salzman&#x27;s &quot;Foxes and Hedgehogs&quot; as part of the &quot;New Image of Sound&quot; series at Hunter College, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. When the poet sent Salzman &quot;Three Madrigals&quot; in 1968, the composer featured them in the seminal &quot;Nude Paper Sermon&quot;, released by Nonesuch Records in 1989.

In the early 1970s, Ashbery began teaching at Brooklyn College, where his students included poet John Yau. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983. In the 1980s, he moved to Bard College, where he was the Charles P. Stevenson, Jr., Professor of Languages and Literature, until 2008, when he retired but continued to win awards, present readings, and work with graduate and undergraduates at many other institutions. He was the poet laureate of New York State from 2001 to 2003, and also served for many years as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. He served on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal &quot;Conjunctions&quot;. In 2008 Ashbery was named the first poet laureate of MtvU, a division of MTV broadcast to U.S. college campuses, with excerpts from his poems featured in 18 promotional spots and the works in their entirety on the broadcaster&#x27;s website.

Ashbery was a Millet Writing Fellow at Wesleyan University in 2010, and participated in Wesleyan&#x27;s Distinguished Writers Series. He was a founding member of The Raymond Roussel Society, with Miquel Barceló, Joan Bofill-Amargós, Michel Butor, Thor Halvorssen and Hermes Salceda.

Ashbery lived in New York City and Hudson, New York, with his husband, David Kermani. He died of natural causes on September 3, 2017, at his home in Hudson, at the age of 90.

==Work==

Ashbery&#x27;s long list of awards began with the Yale Younger Poets Prize in 1956. The selection, by W. H. Auden, of Ashbery&#x27;s first collection, &quot;Some Trees&quot;, later caused some controversy. The volume was screened out in the contest&#x27;s early stages and was given to Auden by Chester Kallman after Auden had decided not to award the prize that year because of the poor quality of the volumes he received. Ashbery&#x27;s early work shows the influence of Auden, along with Wallace Stevens, Boris Pasternak, and many of the French surrealists (his translations from French literature are numerous), though he claimed in a 1956 letter to &quot;hate all modern French poetry, except for Raymond Roussel&quot; and to like his own &quot;wildly inaccurate translations of some of the 20th-century ones, but not the originals&quot;.

In the late 1950s, John Bernard Myers, co-owner of the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, categorized Ashbery&#x27;s avant-garde poetry and that of Kenneth Koch, Frank O&#x27;Hara, James Schuyler, Barbara Guest, Kenward Elmslie and others as a &quot;New York School&quot;, despite their very different styles. In 1953 Myers launched the magazine &quot;Semi-Colon&quot;, in which New York School poets appeared amid an eclectic mix of authors, such as Auden, James Ingram Merill and Saul Bellow.

Ashbery published some work in the avant-garde little magazine &quot;Nomad&quot; at the beginning of the 1960s. He then wrote two collections while in France, the highly controversial &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; (1962) and &quot;Rivers and Mountains&quot; (1966), before returning to New York to write &quot;The Double Dream of Spring&quot;, published in 1970.

Increasing critical recognition in the 1970s transformed Ashbery from an obscure avant-garde experimentalist into one of America&#x27;s most important poets (though still one of its most controversial). After the publication of &quot;Three Poems&quot; (1973) came &quot;Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror&quot;, for which he was awarded the three major American poetry awards: the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award. The collection&#x27;s title poem is considered one of the masterpieces of late 20th century American poetic literature.

His subsequent collection, the more difficult &quot;Houseboat Days&quot; (1977), reinforced Ashbery&#x27;s reputation, as did 1979&#x27;s &quot;As We Know&quot;, which contains the long, double-columned poem &quot;Litany&quot;. In 1988, his &quot;Bridge Poem&quot; was installed, using metal letters, on the 375-foot-wide Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge in Minneapolis; the poet was selected by the bridge&#x27;s architect, artist Siah Armajani, and commissioned by the Walker Art Center. By the 1980s and 1990s, Ashbery had become a central figure in American and more broadly English-language poetry, as his number of imitators attested.

Ashbery&#x27;s works are characterized by a free-flowing, often disjunctive syntax; extensive linguistic play, often infused with considerable humor; and a prosaic, sometimes disarmingly flat or parodic tone. The play of the human mind is the subject of a great many of his poems. He once said that his goal was &quot;to produce a poem that the critic cannot even talk about&quot;. Formally, the earliest poems show the influence of conventional poetic practice, yet by &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; a much more revolutionary engagement with form appears. Ashbery returned to something approaching a reconciliation between tradition and innovation with many of the poems in &quot;The Double Dream of Spring&quot;, though his &quot;Three Poems&quot; are written in long blocks of prose. Although he never again approached the radical experimentation of &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; poems or &quot;The Skaters&quot; and &quot;Into the Dusk-Charged Air&quot; from his collection &quot;Rivers and Mountains&quot;, syntactic and semantic experimentation, linguistic expressiveness, deft, often abrupt shifts of register, and insistent wit remained consistent elements of his work.

Ashbery&#x27;s art criticism has been collected in the 1989 volume &quot;Reported Sightings, Art Chronicles 1957–1987&quot;, edited by the poet David Bergman. He wrote one novel, &quot;A Nest of Ninnies&quot;, with fellow poet James Schuyler, and in his 20s and 30s penned several plays, three of which have been collected in &quot;Three Plays&quot; (1978). Ashbery&#x27;s Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University were published as &quot;Other Traditions&quot; in 2000. A larger collection of his prose writings, &quot;Selected Prose&quot;, appeared in 2005. In 2008, his &quot;Collected Poems 1956–1987&quot; was published as part of the Library of America series. This made Ashbery the first living poet to have his work published by the LOA.

<text>VNV Nation, also known as Victory Not Vengeance, are a British-Irish electronic music group formed in London and led by Ronan Harris in the roles of singer, songwriter and producer, with live members being keyboardists Mike Wimer and David Gerlach and percussionist Chris Roberts.

== History ==
=== Prelude and formation ===
Ronan Harris was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, where he was exposed to electronic music via radio, from which he developed an interest in bands such as Kraftwerk, DAF and the Human League. In 1983, he joined a band named &quot;Die Fabrik&quot;, whose punk-inspired noise and synth style was not well received in Dublin. By 1989, Harris had moved to London and began composing music under the name &quot;Nation&quot;, a 1984-inspired, electronic orchestral music project. Harris relocated to Toronto, Canada, in 1990, but his music output stagnated until 1994 when he revived &quot;Nation&quot;, modified by his newfound motto &quot;Victory Not Vengeance&quot; to become VNV Nation.

=== Early years: &quot;Advance and Follow&quot; and &quot;Praise the Fallen&quot; (1995–1998) ===
The group&#x27;s first release, &quot;Advance and Follow&quot;, came out in 1995. &quot;Advance and Follow&quot; featured industrial electronic beats heavily influenced by middle-era EBM acts such as Nitzer Ebb and Front 242, along a mixture of danceable synthesizer melodies, and elements of orchestral music. Although it was the band&#x27;s first full-length release, Harris regards &quot;Advance and Follow&quot; more as a set of demos than a proper album. In 2001, it was re-released as &quot;Advance and Follow 2.0&quot;, with updated production, re-recorded vocals, and five bonus tracks, which include two Front 242 covers.

Their next release, &quot;Praise the Fallen&quot; in 1998, continued largely in this vein, and they began to enjoy a larger degree of commercial success.

During that time, Harris also wrote for the online magazine &quot;Side-Line&quot;, of which he was the webmaster until 1999.
=== &quot;Empires&quot; (1999–2001) ===
&quot;Empires&quot;, released in 1999, was their breakthrough album, gaining them widespread commercial success and topping the German DAC charts for seven weeks. &quot;Empires&quot; expanded on the band&#x27;s melodic synthesizer lines and incorporated tighter song structures. Furthermore, the harsher &#x27;sheet metal instrumentals&#x27; of &quot;Praise the Fallen&quot; were largely gone, and the music as a whole was more complex with multiple-layered arpeggios and pads. The album was composed using a mix of analog and digital synthesizers, and an Ensoniq ASR-10 sampler. Notable analog synthesizers used on the album included the ARP 2600, which was used for most of the sounds on the tracks &quot;Firstlight,&quot; &quot;Arclight,&quot; and &quot;Standing,&quot; the SCI Pro One, and an Oberheim OB-1. Digital synthesizers used were the Roland JP-8000, Access Virus (used almost exclusively on the track &quot;Darkangel&quot;), Korg Trinity, the EMU Proteus 2000 and the Roland JV-1080.

=== &quot;Futureperfect&quot; (2001–2004) ===
Their 2002 album, &quot;Futureperfect&quot;, while retaining many industrial elements, represented a departure in many ways, largely away from EBM and towards trance and synthpop. Some neoclassical instrumental pieces were included in the album. Around this time Ronan Harris and Apoptygma Berzerk&#x27;s Stefan Groth were credited with coining the term &quot;futurepop&quot; to describe their sound. This shift caused their mainstream popularity to increase still further, but alienated some of their fans who preferred their earlier harsher and darker sound. Notably, the album was produced using only software synthesizers instead of hardware synthesizers. It was the first VNV Nation album made entirely with software synthesizers.

The band embarked on a world tour in support of &quot;Futureperfect&quot; from 2001 to 2003. Their concerts in Berlin, Washington, D.C., and the M&#x27;era Luna Festival were recorded and edited together for release as the &quot;Pastperfect&quot; DVD.
At this time VNV Nation consisted of Ronan Harris and drummer Mark Jackson.

=== &quot;Matter + Form&quot; (2005–2007) ===
Their 2005 album, &quot;Matter + Form&quot;, expanded on the soundscape established with &quot;Futureperfect&quot;. Notable for this harder-edged sound was the first single &quot;Chrome&quot;. Also of note is the lack of effects applied to the vocals, a departure from previous albums, which allows Harris&#x27; voice more space in the mix. There were also several songs with a softer and more pensive theme. Some songs even had a slight &quot;rock&quot; feeling to them, mostly from how drum sequences and bass lines were arranged, the most obvious example being the final song, &quot;Perpetual&quot;. The assortment of instruments used in the production was much larger than on previous albums. While mostly composed using software synthesizers, several different analogue modular synthesizers were used, along with an array of vintage effects. This album was also the first time the band used an outside producer. Both &quot;Matter + Form&quot; and &quot;Chrome&quot; peaked at #1 on the DAC Albums and Singles charts, respectively.

=== &quot;Judgement&quot; (2007–2009) ===
VNV Nation&#x27;s next studio album was &quot;Judgement&quot;, released on 4 April 2007. While written and recorded in VNV Nation&#x27;s own studio, located in the now defunct Soundfactory Studios in Hamburg, the album production took advantage of the main studio&#x27;s facilities through the use of its collection of vintage microphones and effects, and mixing the album on the studio&#x27;s ADT console.

On 25 April 2007, at the sold-out show at The Metro in Chicago, Harris stated that the rumours about &quot;Judgement&quot; being the last album were false and that more was to come and that &quot;Judgement&quot; was just the beginning.

At the alternative electronic music festival Infest in Bradford on 26 August 2007, just after the murder of Sophie Lancaster, Harris dedicated the song &quot;Illusion&quot; to her and contacted the family soon afterwards to offer his condolences.
=== &quot;Reformation 1&quot; and &quot;Of Faith, Power and Glory&quot; (2009) ===
Two years after &quot;Judgement&quot;, the box set &quot;Reformation 1&quot; was released in Europe on 24 April 2009. Its US release was on 12 May.

The next album, &quot;Of Faith, Power and Glory&quot; was mentioned on the band&#x27;s MySpace blog. Harris confirmed to &quot;Side-Line&quot; that they were aiming for late April to release the album, which would be titled &quot;Of Faith, Power and Glory&quot;, or as Harris described it: &quot;The 3 things that people desire and which can make you or destroy you!&quot;

Due to the release of &quot;Reformation 1&quot; in mid-April, the release of the album was postponed; it appeared in the US on CD and in the iTunes Store on 23 June 2009, and in Europe on 19 June 2009.

=== &quot;Crossing the Divide&quot; and &quot;Automatic&quot; (2010–2011) ===
A remix collection called &quot;Crossing The Divide&quot; was planned for release on 8 June 2010, but was delayed until May 2012. The update on the official website cited unforeseen circumstances and personal matters for the delay. On 14 May 2012, the EP was announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page and made available for free via SoundCloud. There were also plans for a number of extended and enhanced re-releases of previous albums in 2010; however these plans did not materialize.

On 16 September 2011, VNV Nation&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Automatic&quot;, was released for most of Europe, with the physical CD released on 25 October 2011 in the United States.

=== &quot;Gothic meets Klassik, Transnational, Resonance: Music For Orchestra Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Compendium 1995-2015 - 20 Years Of Work&quot; (2012–2016) ===
In November 2012, VNV Nation, Blutengel and Staubkind performed at the Gothic meets Klassik festival in Leipzig. On the 10th, they played a standard electronic set, and on the 11th, they performed with Ronan Harris on vocals accompanied by a full symphony orchestra for the first time. The show was recorded for release, but a problem with the recording equipment rendered the audio unusable. As a result, Ronan began to work with the arranger on an album of VNV Nation songs scored for orchestra, which would include the tracks performed at Gothic Meets Klassik as well as additional songs. Ronan also performed a selection of VNV Nation songs with a classical pianist on the 2013 Gothic Cruise.

The album &quot;Transnational&quot; was released on 11 October in Europe, 15 October in North America, and elsewhere on 19 November, preceded by a promotional tour beginning on 2 October 2013.

The orchestral album &quot;&quot; was released on 15 May 2015. It consists of tracks selected from their back catalogue reimagined for orchestra. It was recorded in the Babelsberg Studios outside Berlin at the end of February 2015, the same studios where scores for films such as &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; were recorded. Resonance reached #7 on the official German Album Charts the week of 22 May 2015 and respectively #3 on the US Billboard Classical Crossover Album Charts and #4 on the US Billboard Classical Music Charts for 30 May 2015. A tour for Resonance also took place, featuring the Deutsches Flimorchester Babelsberg.

A twenty-year anniversary tour called “Compendium 1995-2015 - 20 Years Of Work” was announced in 2015, with the European leg starting in Germany on 4 December 2015 and ending in Czechia on 20 April 2016. A North American leg was also announced, starting in Seattle on 7 October 2016 and ending in New York on 29 October 2016.

=== &quot;Automatic Empire, Resonance Extended&quot; and &quot;Noire&quot; (2016–2021) ===

During December 2016 and during late 2017, VNV Nation performed the Automatic Empire tour which consisted of the albums Automatic and Empire played almost in full, with the exceptions being the songs “Photon” from Automatic and “Firstlight” from Empires.

On 16 November 2017, it was announced that Mark Jackson, who had participated as live drummer at concerts since the mid-1990s, had left VNV Nation to “pursue other paths in life”, according to the statement made by the band. Their work on the next album was also teased during this announcement.

The Resonance tour, retitled Resonance Extended, was continued for a few shows in December 2017, also with the Deutsches Flimorchester Babelsberg.

In June 2018, their tenth studio album, &quot;Noire&quot;, was announced along with the European leg of the Noire tour. Noire released as a digital album in all markets and as a physical CD in non-American markets via Anachron Records. In the American market, the physical CD was distributed by Metropolis Records, with a release date of 7 December 2018.

The song &quot;When Is the Future?” was supported by the release of a music video, which released on 8 October 2018, which was the first official VNV Nation music video.

The album received mostly positive reviews, with critics commending its emotional depth and sonic complexity and heavily criticizing the three instrumental tracks on the album.

Noire was followed by the Noire tour, with the first legs of the tour taking place during late 2018 in Europe and North America. The third and final leg of the tour, which also took place in Europe, started and ended in early 2019.

=== &quot;Electric Sun&quot; and &quot;VNV Nation and the Philharmonie Leipzig&quot; (2022–2024) ===
In April 2022, VNV Nation announced that its eleventh studio album, &quot;Electric Sun&quot;, would arrive in April 2023 to coincide with the Electric Sun tour, which started in Denmark on 23 February 2023 and ended in Glasgow on 28 May 2023.

On 28 April 2023, VNV Nation released its eleventh studio album, &quot;Electric Sun&quot;, on LP, CD, and digitally. It was preceded by the singles &quot;Before the Rain&quot; and &quot;Wait,&quot; which was accompanied by VNV Nation&#x27;s second music video. &quot;Wait&quot; spent several weeks at the top of the German Alternative Charts (DAC) in the Summer of 2023 while &quot;Before the Rain&quot; peaked at #2.

Electric Sun received positive reviews, with critics praised the album&#x27;s rich soundscapes and innovative use of both vintage and modern analog synthesizers.

In June 2023, a North American leg of the Electric Sun tour was officially announced to take place during late 2023, with a 2024 leg announced later on after several shows were postponed, making up the final dates of the Electric Sun tour.

A limited time special gold vinyl edition of “Resonance: Music for Orchestra Vol. 1” was announced on 12 June 2023, with a release date of 29 July 2023, with another orchestral tour, this time featuring the Philharmonie Leipzig and Diary of Dreams, being announced shortly after in September 2023. The tour took place during May 2024, only a few days after the end of the Electric Sun tour.

=== &quot;Construct&quot; and &quot;Destruct&quot; (2024–2025) ===
On 9 June 2024, VNV Nation announced that its twelfth studio album and first double album, &quot;Construct // Destruct&quot;, would arrive in 2025 to coincide with a February 2025 European Tour, which starts in Germany on 5 February 2025 and ends in Sweden on 6 April 2025.

In late 2024, VNV Nation was added to the Festival Mediaval, the Amphi Festival, and the Der Schwarze Ball 2025 lineups as headliners, with all shows a part of the Construct // Destruct tour.

During an interview in December of 2024, it was revealed that the double album, originally called &quot;Construct // Destruct&quot;, had been split into &quot;Construct&quot; and &quot;Destruct&quot;, with Ronan saying, &quot;Construct became bigger, and Destruct became something completely different than was ever imagined&quot;. It was later revealed &quot;Construct&quot; would be released in late March and &quot;Destruct&quot; would be released a few weeks later.

<text>Jyväskylä () is a city in Finland and the regional capital of Central Finland. It is located in the Finnish Lakeland. The population of Jyväskylä is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is Finland&#x27;s most populous municipality, and fifth most populous urban area.

Jyväskylä is located about northeast of Tampere, the third largest city in Finland; and about north of Helsinki, the national capital. The Jyväskylä sub-region includes Jyväskylä, Hankasalmi, Laukaa, Muurame, Petäjävesi, Toivakka, and Uurainen. Other neighbouring municipalities of Jyväskylä are Joutsa, Jämsä and Luhanka.

Jyväskylä is the largest city in the Central Finland and Finnish Lakeland region. Jyväskylä was one of the fastest growing cities in Finland during the 20th century; in 1940, there were only 8,000 inhabitants in Jyväskylä.

Elias Lönnrot, the author of the Finnish national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, nicknamed the city &quot;the Athens of Finland&quot;. This nickname refers to Jyväskylä&#x27;s important role as an educational centre. The works of the famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto can be seen throughout the city. The city hosts the Rally Finland, which is part of the World Rally Championship. The annual Jyväskylä Arts Festival is also held in the city.

==Etymology==
The second part of the city&#x27;s name, &quot;kylä&quot;, means village. The first part of the city&#x27;s name, &quot;jyväs-&quot;, looks like the stem of an adjective &quot;*jyvänen&quot;, derived from &quot;jyvä&quot;, &quot;grain&quot; (compare Wiktionary). Alternatively, it has been associated with &quot;Taxus&quot;, a genus of yews, and the Old Prussian word &quot;juwis&quot;. It has also been speculated that the word &quot;jyväs&quot; refers to the sun&#x27;s reflection of the surface of the water.

Erkki Fredrikson, the curator of the Museum of Central Finland, put forward a theory related to the name, that the origin word for the city&#x27;s name was &quot;syväs&quot; and not &quot;jyväs&quot;, and that the name was once derived from &quot;Jyväsjoki&quot; (literally the &quot;grain river&quot;), which, according to Fredrikson&#x27;s assumption, was actually called &quot;Syväsjoki&quot; (literally the &quot;deep river&quot;). However, the name Jyväsjoki was registered in 1506 for the region&#x27;s first known resident, Heikki Ihanninpoika Jyväsjoki. His house was located at the mouth of the Äijälänjoki River, which in Fredrikson&#x27;s opinion also supports the Syväsjoki theory. The village, known at the beginning as Jyväsjoki village, gradually transformed into Jyväskylä.

==History==

In the Jyväskylä region, there are archeological findings from the Stone Age. According to the oldest available taxation documents (&quot;maakirja&quot;), there were seven estates on the Jyväskylä region in 1539. One of them, the estate of Mattila, alone possessed the areas stretching from the village of Keljo to the villages of Vesanka and Palokka. The oldest estate in Jyväskylä continuously held by the same family is the estate of Lahti, which emerged when the estate of Mattila was split between two brothers in 1600. The history of the Lahti family and estate have had a significant impact on the development of Jyväskylä region. Lahdenrinne, in the south-west corner of Jyväsjärvi lake, belongs to the old heartland of the estate of Lahti.

The name Jyväskylä was mentioned in 1575 as &quot;Jyueskylä&quot;. Its name is derived from the lake Jyväsjärvi. A shorter form of the name, &quot;Jyväs&quot; (written &quot;Jyuexe&quot;) was mentioned slightly earlier in 1565 and again (this time written &quot;Jyues&quot;) in 1570.

The City of Jyväskylä was founded on 22 March 1837, when Emperor of Russia and Grand Duke of Finland, Nicholas I of Russia, signed the charter of the city and the infrastructure was essentially built from scratch; before that, Jyväskylä was a village belonging to the larger rural municipality of Laukaa, being the largest village of the whole parish. At the times Finnish military battalion Suomen kaarti participated under his rule in military operations against the Polish November Uprising and later in Hungary, Turkey and Bessarabia (today Moldova). While Nicholas I of Russia abolished many autonomous areas, it has been argued, that the loyalty of Finnish military influenced his approach towards Finnish autonomy. The original town was built between Lake Jyväsjärvi (which is connected to Lake Päijänne) and the Jyväskylä ridge (Harju), and consisted of most of the current grid-style city centre.

The establishment of schools in the 1850s and &#x27;60s proved to be the most significant step in regards to the later development of Jyväskylä. The first three Finnish-speaking schools in the world were founded in Jyväskylä, the lycée in 1858, the teachers’ college in 1863, and the girls’ school in 1864. Well-trained teaching staff and pupils from different parts of the country changed the atmosphere of Jyväskylä irrevocably.

In the early 20th century, the town expanded several times. Most of today&#x27;s Jyväskylä was built after the Continuation War, when evacuees from ceded territories were settled in the city, and housing was badly needed. During the 21st century Jyväskylä has grown fast – by over 1,000 inhabitants every year.

Säynätsalo was consolidated with Jyväskylä in 1993, and Jyväskylän maalaiskunta and Korpilahti, for their part, on January 1, 2009.

==Geography==
Jyväskylä is located on the northern coast of Lake Päijänne, north-east of Tampere, south-west of Kuopio and north of Helsinki. The hilly and forested terrain in Jyväskylä is surrounded by hundreds of lakes. To reach Jyväskylä from the east, one needs to go through or pass the hill Kanavuori, which used to host a military depot full of ammunition and armaments.

Jyväskylä is located in the Finnish Lakeland. There are 328 lakes in the city, and lakes and rivers constitute 20,1% () of the total area of the city. The city&#x27;s largest lakes are Päijänne, Leppävesi, Tuomiojärvi, Palokkajärvi, Luonetjärvi, and Alvajärvi-Korttajärvi. The city center is located on the shores of a small Jyväsjärvi.
The landscape in Jyväskylä is hilly, forested and full of waters. The architect Alvar Aalto compared the hilly landscape of Jyväskylä to Toscana in Italy: &quot;The slope of Jyväskylä ridge is almost like the mountain vineyards of Fiesole&quot;.

===Climate===
The defined climate is a subarctic continental (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;). Because of its northern location, winters are long, snowy, cold, and dark. During midwinter, the city receives daylight for only around five hours. Summers are mild, with the average daily maximum temperature being in July. During the summer, Jyväskylä experiences long daylight and white nights i.e. midnight twilight.

==Economy==

Because of excellent connections, Jyväskylä was a busy marketplace even before the first permanent settlements were founded in the current city centre. The establishment of Finland&#x27;s first three Finnish-speaking schools: the lycée in 1858, the teachers’ college in 1863, and the girls’ school in 1864 proved to be the most significant steps in regards to later development of Jyväskylä. Educational services became the heart of the economic growth of the city. In 1912 Wilhelm Schauman founded a plywood mill on the shores of Jyväsjärvi. Schaumans plywood factory soon became the country&#x27;s largest producer of plywood. Soon other kinds of forest based businesses opened factories and premises in the city. Thus, lumber, pulp, and paper became the second stronghold of the economy in Jyväskylä. Later, the high quality education and paper machinery industry tempted information technology businesses to settle in the city.

Nowadays, the main sources of subsistence in Jyväskylä are educational and health care services, paper machinery production, information technology, and renewable energy. The most important private employers are paper machinery producer Metso ltd., retail trade company Keskimaa Cooperative Society, real estate service company ISS, and wind turbine gear manufacturer Moventas. The biggest public employers are the City of Jyväskylä, the Central Finland Health Care District, the University of Jyväskylä, and the Air Force Academy.

The regional GDP per capita is lower than the Finnish national average, mainly due to high number of students and a relatively high unemployment rate.

==Cityscape==


Jyväskylä was founded in the northern end of the lake Päijänne at the crossroads of three major waterways. Lakes control the cityscape. The city grid plan from 1833 by Jacob Leonard Boringh can be well recognised in the city center. Nevertheless, due to very rapid population growth, the cityscape has gone through one of the most massive changes in all of Finland.

Nowadays, Jyväskylä is a city of modern architecture. The city has more buildings designed by one of the best known international functionalist architects Alvar Aalto than any other city in the world.

The establishment of schools in the 1850s and 1860s proved to be the most important step from the point of view of the later development of Jyväskylä. The headquarters of the University of Jyväskylä are considered to be Aalto&#x27;s masterpieces. Later, a modern architect Arto Sipinen, a pupil of Aalto, has influenced the cityscape since the 1970s by designing most of the new university buildings in the city.

The outskirts of the city are mainly populated by student apartments and single-family houses. Some of the most important buildings, like Säynätsalo Town Hall, designed by Aalto are located outside the city centre in Säynätsalo and Muuratsalo.

Consolidated areas Korpilahti, Jyväskylän maalaiskunta, Säynätsalo and also western parts of Jyväskylä are mainly countryside dominated by hilly forests and lakes.

Schauman Mansion, a historic red-brick castle-like building, adds to Jyväskylä’s architectural heritage. Originally built in the early 20th century as the headquarters for the Schauman plywood factory, it now serves as a landmark of the city’s industrial past. Located near Lutakko, the building stands in contrast to Jyväskylä’s modern skyline, reflecting the city’s blend of old and new architecture.

==Transport==

Jyväskylä railway station is served by VR direct trains to Helsinki, Pieksämäki, Tampere, Turku, Vaasa and many other destinations in Finland. The station was extensively modernised in 2002.

Jyväskylä Airport is situated in Tikkakoski, about north of Jyväskylä. It has regular direct flights to Helsinki Airport. The airport serves also as a military and charter airport.

The city is on crossroads of many main roads of Finland. Highway 4 (E75) passes the city from south to north, and Highway 9 (E63) from southeast to northwest. Highway 23 between Pori and Joensuu also runs through Jyväskylä.

Jyväskylä harbour is home to many passenger ships operating on lake Päijänne. During summer time, there are direct ship connections to Lahti, Jämsä, Suolahti, Viitasaari, and some other cities.

The public transportation system of Jyväskylä is managed by the city under the Linkki brand and operated under contract to the city by Jyväskylän liikenne, Länsilinjat and Mennään Bussilla. It is based on bus lines.

==Education==

Jyväskylä is a traditional centre of education. Including school children, and the students in high schools, vocational schools, the university of applied sciences, and the universities, the number of students and pupils in the city reaches 45,000, boosting Jyväskylä&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;student city&quot;. Over 30% of the city population are students. A number of firsts in Finnish education have taken place in Jyväskylä:
* Jyväskylä Lyceum (Finnish: &quot;Jyväskylän Lyseon lukio&quot;) is the world&#x27;s first junior secondary school with Finnish as the language of instruction. It started its first term on 1 October 1858 and turned 160 years old in 2018. Lyceum still exists and is one of the three upper secondary schools in the city.
* The first Finnish-medium teacher training college (1863)
* The first Finnish-medium school for girls (1864)
* Finland&#x27;s first Summer University (1912)

Due to this, among other things, the city has earned the nickname &quot;Athens of Finland&quot;. The teacher training college later evolved into the College of Education (1934) and further into the multidisciplinary University of Jyväskylä (1966).

The University of Jyväskylä is one of the most popular universities in Finland. Almost 16,000 students are enrolled to study for a bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree, and the university also offers PhD programs in most of its subjects. Historically, the university has excelled in the study of education, but in the last few decades it has also gained respect in the sciences. It is the only university in Finland offering university-level education in sports, training sports teachers and coaches. Today the university offers also Cyber Security degrees, in close co-operation with the Finnish Defence Forces. According to the Ministry of Employment and the Economy the city has been acknowledged in 2013 as the Cyber Security City, providing a portfolio of Cyber Security related studies and activities.

JAMK University of Applied Sciences has 8.000 students. It has four different units: School of Business and Services Management, School of Health and Social Studies, School of Technology and Teacher Education College. HUMAK University of Applied Sciences educates cultural management in Jyväskylä.

<text>Evonne Fay Goolagong Cawley (née Goolagong; born 31 July 1951) is an Australian former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA), and was one of the world&#x27;s leading players in the 1970s and early 1980s. Goolagong won 86 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including seven singles majors, and 46 doubles titles, including seven doubles majors.

At the age of 19, Goolagong won the French Open singles and the Australian Open doubles championships (the latter with Margaret Court). She won the women&#x27;s singles tournament at Wimbledon in 1971. In 1980 she won Wimbledon again, this time as a mother and becoming the first mother to win the title in 66 years. She represented Australia in three Fed Cup competitions, winning the title in 1971, 1973 and 1974, and was Fed Cup captain for three consecutive years. After retiring from professional tennis in 1983, Goolagong played in senior invitational competitions, endorsed a variety of products, worked as a touring professional, and held sports-related leadership roles.

Goolagong was named Australian of the Year in 1971. She was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1972 and as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1982. Goolagong was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985, the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1988, and the Aboriginal Sporting Hall of Fame in 1989. She leads the Goolagong National Development Camp for Indigenous boys and girls, which encourages Indigenous youth to stay in school.

==Early life==
Evonne is the third of eight children from an Australian Aboriginal (Wiradjuri) family. Her father, Ken Goolagong, was a sheep shearer and her mother, Melinda, was a homemaker. Evonne was born in Griffith, New South Wales, and grew up in the small country town of Barellan.

Goolagong grew up during the time of the stolen generations in Australia, and was directly impacted by it:

Lucky not to be taken away by the stolen generation because I&#x27;ve had to hide a few times under the bed. We visited my cousin in Griffith, which is where I was born, in the mission there. Every time a shiny car would come down the road, my mum used to say &quot;you better run and hide, the welfare man&#x27;s going to take you away.&quot; So I remember hiding very nervously under the bed, &#x27;cause I didn&#x27;t want to get taken away.

Despite the widespread disadvantage and prejudice Aboriginal people experienced in Australia, Goolagong was able to play tennis in Barellan from childhood, thanks to an area resident, Bill Kurtzman, who saw her peering through the fence at the local courts and encouraged her to come in and play.

In 1965, Vic Edwards, the proprietor of a tennis school in Sydney, was tipped off by two of his assistants, travelled to Barellan to take a look at the young Goolagong, and immediately saw her potential. He persuaded her parents to allow her to move to Sydney, where she attended Willoughby Girls High School. There, she completed her School Certificate in 1968 and, at the same time, lived with the family of Edwards, who had become her legal guardian, coach, and manager.

==Playing career==
===Overall record===
With seven championships, Goolagong is 12th on the women&#x27;s list of all-time singles Grand Slam winners, and ended her career with 86 singles titles. She took singles and doubles titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon and singles and mixed doubles titles at the French Open. She never won the US Open. She won seven Grand Slam singles titles in her career, reaching a total of 18 Grand Slam singles finals.

Goolagong reached four consecutive US Open singles finals, from 1973 to 1976, but lost them all. She is the only player in U.S. Championships history to have lost four consecutive finals. Goolagong made seven consecutive finals at the Australian Open, winning three titles in a row. Despite reaching the final at her first two appearances in 1971 and 1972, after 1973 Goolagong did not compete at the Roland-Garros for a decade. The French Tennis Federation banned all World Team Tennis contracted players from the 1974 event, with the player&#x27;s unions instigating legal action against the French authorities. As Jimmy Connors and Goolagong were the reigning Australian Open champions, they spearheaded the legal action as they were being deprived of the opportunity to attain the tennis calendar Grand Slam as a result of the decision. Connors admitted this was a huge distraction and later wrote both he and Goolagong were &quot;hung out to dry&quot;. Goolagong boycotted the event even after the ban was lifted, but returned in 1983 for her final Grand Slam singles appearance. She lost in the last thirty-two to Chris Evert and did not compete in any further Grand Slam singles events. Her last appearance at Grand Slam level came at the following 1983 Wimbledon Championships when she partnered with Sue Barker to a first-round defeat in the doubles, having withdrawn from the singles event earlier.

Her career win/loss percentage was 81.0% (704–165). Her win/loss performance in all Grand Slam singles tournaments was 82.1% (133–29), at the French Open 84.2% (16–3), at Wimbledon 83.3% (50–10), at the US Open 81.3% (26–6), and at the Australian Open 80.4% (41–10).

Goolagong was ranked No. 1 in the world in women&#x27;s tennis for two weeks in 1976, but it was not reported at the time because incomplete data was used to calculate the rankings. This was discovered in December 2007, 31 years later. She was the second woman to hold the top spot, but the 16th at the time she was finally recognised.

===1970s===

During the 1970s, Goolagong Cawley played in 17 Grand Slam singles finals, a period record for any player, man or woman. From her first Grand Slam singles final appearance in January 1971, to December 1977 when she won her last Grand Slam title of the 1970s, she played in 21 Grand Slam events. Her only four defeats prior to the finals came at the 1972 US Open in the third round; 1974 Wimbledon, where she was defeated in the quarterfinals; and at the semifinal stages of the French Open and Wimbledon in 1973. To start the decade, she was defeated at the 1970 Australian Open in the quarterfinals and in the second round of the 1970 Wimbledon. In 1971, 1975, 1976 and 1977, Goolagong reached the final of every Grand Slam championship in which she competed.

Between 1973 and 1977, she reached the final of almost every Grand Slam singles event she entered. The exceptions were: Roland-Garros, where she lost to Margaret Court in the semifinals in 1973; and Wimbledon, where she played in only two finals in that period, 1975 and 1976, losing both; she lost in 1973 to eventual champion Billie Jean King in the semifinals; and in 1974 to Australian Kerry Melville at the quarterfinal stage; she did not enter in 1977, the year her daughter was born. Also in 1974, she teamed with Peggy Michel, her teammate on the Pittsburgh Triangles of the World Team Tennis league, to win the ladies&#x27; doubles title. She won the women&#x27;s doubles title at the Australian Open five times and in Roland Garros once, as well as mixed doubles at Roland Garros once.

Following her victory at the season-ending WTA Championships in 1976—known at the time as the Virginia Slims Championships—her seventh tournament victory of the year, Goolagong continued to play on the WTA Tour until 1983, but never again played a full season. After her victory over Chris Evert in the WTA Championships, she only played in three competitive tournaments for the remainder of 1976, losing in both finals to Evert (Wimbledon and US Open) and the Sydney quarterfinals in November, which she played while four months pregnant. She focused instead on WTT Team Tennis, winning the WTT Championship as a member of the Pittsburgh Triangles in 1975 and playing exhibition events.

Goolagong realised during the 1976 US Open final that she was pregnant and after one more tournament for the year, she did not play again on the regular tour until the summer of 1977, continuing through to Wimbledon 1978. 1976 had been her best season to date, winning seven titles, rising to number one in the world and losing only to Chris Evert, which she did five times and once to Dianne Fromholtz in Sydney, which she played in the second trimester of her pregnancy. No other players were able to score a victory over her in the year.

After attempting a comeback in the summer of 1977, Goolagong decided to wait for the Australian season beginning later in the year for a full return. Her return to the tour proper kick-started a highly successful run of play, during which she won ten tournaments including the Australian Open in a run of five consecutive tournament wins and reached the final in two others, including the season-ending WTA Championships, where she lost to Martina Navratilova.

At the Virginia Slims of Boston in March 1978, Goolagong beat both Navratilova and Evert back-to-back to win the title. It was her only post pregnancy victory over Navratilova and one of only two she scored over Evert. Prior to her first pregnancy, Goolagong led Navratilova 11–4 in their rivalry, but she lost 11 of their 12 matches after her daughter was born to trail 12–15 at the end of her career. From being un-ranked at the beginning of her return, Goolagong&#x27;s ranking rose to No. 3 in the world, but during Wimbledon 1978, a career-threatening ankle injury forced her to miss the remainder of 1978, other than the exhibition Emeron Cup event played in December, where she played with her ankle heavily strapped and lost to both Navratilova and Virginia Wade in straight sets. She did not return to competitive play until March 1979, when she won four tournaments and ended the year ranked No. 4 in the world.

===1980s===
Injuries and illness at the beginning of 1980 kept her away from the tour for many weeks in the first six months of the year and only reached four finals, but she returned in triumph at Wimbledon, yet only played three further tournaments and the exhibition Lion&#x27;s Cup for the remainder of the year after her final Grand Slam victory. For her Wimbledon triumph, Goolagong beat four top 10 players (Hana Mandlíková #9, Wendy Turnbull #6, Tracy Austin #2 and Chris Evert #3), the only champion in Wimbledon history to do so. She also beat two former Grand Slam finalists in earlier rounds, Sharon Walsh and Betty Stöve. She withdrew from the US Open, where she had been seeded fourth, due to a recurring back injury and the early stages of her second pregnancy, but she did play the Lion&#x27;s Cup (losing to Evert) and the Australian Open championships at the end of the year despite being four and five months pregnant respectively. Other players, notably Wendy Turnbull, publicly decried the decision by Tennis Australia to pay Goolagong appearance fees to compete at the Australian Open from 1980 onwards. Goolagong defended the decision to accept the fees to compete in her later autobiography.

Goolagong was then absent for almost all of 1981, returning to tournament play in Australia towards the end of the year and after losing in the first round in Perth, she reached the quarterfinals of the only other two tournaments she played for the year, losing to Evert in Sydney, and at the Australian Open to Navratilova. Her comeback wasn&#x27;t consistent and she didn&#x27;t play again until March 1982 when she pushed Evert to three sets and beat reigning French Open champion Hana Mandlikova in the Citizen Cup played on clay in March 1982.

Goolagong then lost her first matches of all her next three tournaments; pulling out in the final set of the Family Circle Cup to Joanne Russell; losing to Pam Teeguarden at the Dow Classic and at Wimbledon 1982, where she was given a protected seeding of 16th by the All England Club, losing her only match to Zina Garrison. For the remainder of the year, Cawley played little, but did win two of her three matches in the Federation Cup. Cawley didn&#x27;t play competitively again until November when she lost in the first round to Sue Barker in Brisbane, but reached her only singles final at Sydney, where after beating world no.3 Andrea Jaeger, she lost in three sets to Navratilova. She followed this with a three-set loss to Candy Reynolds in the last 32 of the Australian Open. Despite the lack of play, Cawley ended the year ranked 17th and was given a spot in the WTA season ending championship, where she lost to Pam Shriver.

In 1983, she failed to reach the quarterfinal of any event and played her last Grand Slam singles match at the French Open, where she lost to Evert in the third round. At the Dow Classic in Edgbaston, she lost in the last 16 to Anne White, before withdrawing from Wimbledon. Despite not playing the singles, she partnered Sue Barker in the Wimbledon doubles event, losing in the first round, her last Grand Slam appearance.

A brief return to competitive play came in 1985, when in May 1985, Goolagong accepted an invitation to compete at the Australian Indoor Championship, played on carpet. She lost her only match to another Australian veteran, Amanda Tobin Evans.

She is the only mother to have won the Wimbledon title since Dorothea Lambert Chambers in 1914. Married to Roger Cawley in 1975, she had a daughter in 1977.

==Life after touring==

Beginning during her playing days, Goolagong endorsed many products and appeared in numerous television and print commercials, extending these further once she retired from competitive play. Her various commercials included KFC (in which she appeared with her husband Roger), &quot;Geritol&quot; and &quot;Sears&quot;, where she also promoted her own sports clothing brand &#x27;Go Goolagong&#x27;.

A one-off return to competitive action came at the 1985 Australian Indoor Championship organised by the ITF, but Goolagong lost her only match.

In 1988, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

In 1990, Goolagong began to play in senior invitational competitions, returning to Wimbledon to compete in the inaugural ladies senior invitational doubles, alongside compatriot Kerry Melville Reid.

Goolagong spent some time as a touring professional at the Hilton Head Racquet Club in South Carolina before returning to Australia.

Goolagong was a member of the Board of the Australian Sports Commission from 1995 to 1997 and since 1997 has held the position of Sports Ambassador to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities. She was appointed captain of the Australian Fed Cup team in 2002. In 2003, she was the winner for the Oceania region of the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Women and Sports Trophy&quot;. She also runs an annual &quot;Goolagong National Development Camp&quot;, with the aim of encouraging Aboriginal children to stay in school through playing competitive tennis.

On 10 October 2023, Goolagong was one of 25 Australians of the Year who signed an open letter supporting the Yes vote in the Indigenous Voice referendum, initiated by psychiatrist Patrick McGorry.

==Awards and recognition==
Goolagong was awarded Australian of the Year in 1971. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1972 and made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1982. In 1985 she was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. In 1988, Goolagong was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 2018, she was advanced to a Companion of the Order of Australia &quot;for eminent service to tennis as a player at the national and international level, as an ambassador, supporter and advocate for the health, education and wellbeing of young Indigenous people through participation in sport, and as a role model&quot;.

In 1972, she played in a segregated South African tournament. To spare her the discrimination experienced by non-whites, the South African authorities classified her as an honorary white.

In 1978 and 1980, she was awarded the WTA Sportsmanship Award.

The Evonne Goolagong Cawley Trophy, awarded to the female champion at the Brisbane International, is named in her honour.

In 1993, the State Transit Authority named a RiverCat ferry in Sydney after her. This rivercat travels daily from Parramatta to Circular Quay.

The National Museum of Australia holds the Evonne Goolagong Cawley collection of memorabilia. This includes her 1971 and 1980 Wimbledon singles trophies, the trophy from her 1974 doubles win and two racquets used in these tournaments. The museum&#x27;s collection also includes a signed warm-up jacket and a dress with a bolero style top designed by Ted Tinling in the early 1970s.

In 2001, Goolagong was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women for her achievements as a tennis player.

A long replica of a tennis racquet used by Goolagong has been built in Evonne Goolagong Park in Goolagong&#x27;s hometown of Barellan. Goolagong unveiled the exact scale model of the wooden Dunlop racquet during Barellan&#x27;s centenary celebrations on 3 October 2009.

In February 2016, Goolagong and ten other Australian tennis players were honoured by Australia Post as the recipients of the 2016 Australia Post Legends Award and appeared on a postage stamp set named Australian Legends of Singles Tennis.

In April 2016, Goolagong was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of South Australia in recognition of her distinguished service to the community.

In June 2018, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) presented her with its highest accolade, the Philippe Chatrier Award for her contributions to tennis.

Goolagong is generally regarded as one of the all-time greats of women&#x27;s tennis.

==Personal life==
When Victor Edwards became her coach, Goolagong went to live with him and his family. He became her legal guardian as well as her coach and manager. Goolagong later revealed that Edwards made sexual advances to her. When she met former junior British tennis player Roger Cawley in 1971, her relationship with Edwards became strained, but she was legally tied to Edwards, who controlled every aspect of her career and finances until her marriage to Cawley on 19 June 1975. Goolagong severed all contact with Edwards at that point, although he remained her official coach for Wimbledon 1975. During the tournament, Edwards sat on the opposite side of the players&#x27; box from Roger Cawley at her matches, and he and his protégée were no longer on speaking terms. Cawley became her coach, hitting partner, and manager from the time they married. Following her wedding, she settled in Naples, Florida.

Goolagong&#x27;s father Ken was killed in a car crash in 1974, shortly after Edwards had refused to release any of her money to purchase a new family vehicle when requested. Her mother Melinda died in 1991. Intrigued by meeting so many Indigenous Australian relatives for the first time at the funeral, the Cawleys bought a home in Noosa Heads, Queensland and settled there with their two United States-born children. Her daughter Kelly (born 1977) helps run her tennis camps, and her son Morgan Kiema Cawley (born 1981) was a National Soccer League player. Goolagong is also the maternal great aunt of National Rugby League player Latrell Mitchell, born Latrell Goolagong.

Goolagong&#x27;s brother, Ian, was an amateur tennis player who never pursued the sport professionally, but he partnered with Evonne in the mixed doubles tournament at Wimbledon in 1982 (the pair lost their only match). , Ian Goolagong was the president and coach at the Lalor Tennis Club in Victoria.

==In the arts and popular culture==
A play based on the life of Goolagong Cawley called &quot;Sunshine Super Girl&quot;, written and directed by Andrea James, was to have premièred with the Melbourne Theatre Company in 2020, but the event was cancelled owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Instead, it premiered in Griffith, New South Wales, in October 2020 before a run at the Sydney Festival in January 2021, produced by Performing Lines.

==Career statistics==
===Grand Slam tournament performance timeline===

Note: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December. Goolagong won the December edition. She was seeded fourth for the 1980 US Open Championships, but withdrew from the tournament before play began.

===Grand Slam tournament finals===
====Singles: 18 (7–11)====
====Women&#x27;s doubles: 7 (6–1)====
Note: The shared women&#x27;s doubles title at the Australian Open in 1977 (December) isn&#x27;t traditionally counted in Goolagong&#x27;s win total because the finals were never played. Otherwise, she would have 14 Grand Slam titles, 6 Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles titles, and 7 Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles finals.
Evonne Cawley is occasionally credited incorrectly with winning the 1977 Ladies Doubles event at Wimbledon, due to the confusion regarding the married name of her compatriot Helen Gourlay who in fact took the trophy. Both women were listed in tournaments as Mrs. R. Cawley (Goolagong was Mrs. R.A.Cawley and Gourlay Mrs. R.L.Cawley). Goolagong Cawley did not participate at Wimbledon 1977.

====Mixed doubles: 2 (1–1)====
===Records===
* These records were attained in the Open Era of tennis.

<text>The shelducks, most species of which are found in the genus Tadorna (except for the Radjah shelduck, which is now found in its own monotypic genus &quot;Radjah&quot;), are a group of large birds in the Tadorninae subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans.

==Biology==
Shelducks are a group of large, often semi-terrestrial waterfowl, which can be seen as intermediate between geese (&quot;Anserinae&quot;) and ducks. They are mid-sized (some 50–60 cm) Old World waterfowl. The sexes are colored slightly differently in most species, and all have a characteristic upperwing coloration in flight: the tertiary remiges form a green speculum, the secondaries and primaries are black, and the coverts (forewing) are white. Their diet consists of small shore animals (winkles, crabs etc.) as well as grasses and other plants.

They were originally known as &quot;sheldrakes&quot;, which remained the most common name until the late 19th century. The word is still sometimes used to refer to a male shelduck and can also occasionally refer to the canvasback (&quot;Aythya valisineria&quot;) of North America.

==Systematics==
The genus &quot;Tadorna&quot; was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The type species is the common shelduck. The genus name comes from the French name &quot;Tadorne&quot; for the common shelduck. It may originally derive from Celtic roots meaning &quot;pied waterfowl&quot;, essentially the same as the English &quot;shelduck&quot;. A group of them is called a &quot;dopping,&quot; taken from the Harley Manuscript.

The namesake genus of the Tadorninae, &quot;Tadorna&quot; is very close to the Egyptian goose and its extinct relatives from the Madagascar region, &quot;Alopochen&quot;. While the classical shelducks form a group that is obviously monophyletic, the interrelationships of these, the aberrant common and especially Radjah sheducks, and the Egyptian goose were found to be poorly resolved by mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data; this genus may thus be paraphyletic.

*Ruddy shelduck (&quot;Tadorna ferruginea&quot;)
*South African shelduck (&quot;Tadorna cana&quot;)
*Australian shelduck (&quot;Tadorna tadornoides&quot;)
*Paradise shelduck (&quot;Tadorna variegata&quot;)
*† Crested shelduck (&quot;Tadorna cristata&quot;) - possibly extinct (late 20th century?)
*Common shelduck (&quot;Tadorna tadorna&quot;)

The Radjah sheduck, formerly placed in the genus &quot;Tadorna&quot;, is now placed in its own monotypic genus:
*Radjah shelduck (&quot;Radjah radjah&quot;)

Fossil bones from Dorkovo (Bulgaria) described as &quot;Balcanas pliocaenica&quot; may actually belong to this genus. They have even been proposed to be referable to the common shelduck, but their Early Pliocene age makes this rather unlikely.

<text>Competitor indexing is a price setting technique used by marketers, in which a firm pegs the prices of its products to those of a competitor. This may involve matching competitors&#x27; prices, or setting prices at a fixed amount or percentage above or below. This strategy is typically used by fringe firms in industries with one or two dominant companies, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;follow the leader&quot; strategy. 

Its main advantage is convenience, as extensive marketing research and statistical analysis are not required. The main disadvantage is that it is purely reactive. Price cannot be used as a variable when constructing a marketing mix: it becomes a constant over which the firm has no control.

<doc id="258769" wikidata="Q8060807" url="?curid=258769" title="Yukon (solitaire)">
<text>Yukon is a type of patience or solitaire card game using a single deck of playing cards like Klondike, but there is no deck or stock, and manipulation of the tableau works differently. 

==Rules==

Yukon has the following adjustments to the game-play of standard Klondike solitaire:
* There are 7 rows of tableau stacks, and 4 foundations that build up in suit. Their lengths are respectively: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The topmost 5 cards of each stack are face-up, while the rest of the cards underneath them are face-down. (Second stack onwards is an ascending pyramid of face-down cards, each with 5 face-up cards appended on top).
* Groups of cards can be moved; the cards below the one to be moved do not need to be in any order, except that the starting and target cards must be built in sequence and in alternate color. For example, a group starting with a Red 3 can be moved on top a Black 4, and the cards below the Red 3 can differ.
* There is no stock in Yukon. All cards are dealt at the beginning; however, some are face down.

==Strategy==
* Expose the face down cards as soon as possible, so you can start moving cards around.
* Moving the Aces to the Foundations as soon as possible is critical to gameplay.

==Variants==
Russian Solitaire is a solitaire card game that is very similar in layout and play to Yukon. Its difference from Yukon is that building is by suit. The game should not be confused with Nidgi Novgorod, first recorded in the 1903 American Hoyle and also sometimes called Russian Solitaire, which is a simple, one-pack, non-builder, nor with Russian Patience, first described in 1876, which is a two-pack, open packer similar to Capricieuse.

Other Yukon variants remove the usual restriction that only Kings be placed in empty tableau spaces. Also closely related to Yukon are Alaska and Australian Patience.

<doc id="258774" wikidata="Q4893460" url="?curid=258774" title="Hate (comics)">
<text>Hate is a comic book by writer-artist Peter Bagge. First published by Fantagraphics in 1990 it ran for 30 issues, and was one of the best-selling alternative comics of the 1990s, at its height selling 30,000 copies an issue. In 2000 Bagge revived the series in &quot;Hate Annual&quot;, a yearly comic that continues the story after &quot;Hate&quot; in short stories, and includes writings on libertarianism, culture, and topical cartoons.

&quot;Hate&quot; follows the life of Buddy Bradley, in a continuation of events from Bagge&#x27;s strip &quot;The Bradleys&quot; from former publications &quot;Neat Stuff.&quot; It is set for the first half in Seattle and later in suburban New Jersey. Buddy has to deal with the end of adolescence, reluctantly growing up, his relationships with a host of unpleasant acquaintances he has to class as friends, working in dead-end jobs and having no direction in life. Bagge used memories of events from his own life as material.

&quot;Hate&quot; has been referenced by many commentators as an important example of Generation X comic culture and grunge culture in general. Bagge tends to see the parallels with the grunge lifestyle as largely coincidental, as he was referencing events that had happened to him ten years previous. The comic was also released in Europe in the mid-&#x27;90s as Spanish, Italian and German language editions, the Spanish &quot;Odio&quot; proving particularly popular.

==Publication history==
First published by Fantagraphics from 1990 to 1998, it ran for 30 issues, and was one of the best-selling alternative comics. The series continues in &quot;Hate Annual&quot;, (9) yearly collection of comics stories and articles that began in 2000.
A major story and format change took place in issue #16, when Buddy moved from Seattle back home to New Jersey, at which point the comic, once in black-and-white, changed to color. With issue #16, Bagge also started using an inker (rather unusual for an alternative comic book), Jim Blanchard.

&quot;Hate&quot;&#x27;s final five issues were 48-page anthologies, featuring a main Buddy Bradley story and then a series of short backup stories by cartoonists such as Rick Altergott, Dame Darcy, and Kevin Scalzo.

In February 2024, Fantagraphics announced a new series by Bagge entitled &quot;Hate Revisited&quot;, which sees Buddy and his family dealing with modern time shenanigans. It is set to release on June 6, 2024.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
*Buddy Bradley

* Lisa Leavenworth, emotionally unstable, unconfident and sloppy, Lisa had a one-night stand with Buddy before the storyline of &quot;Hate&quot; began. After Buddy&#x27;s breakup with Valerie, Lisa became his long term girlfriend and moves back to Jersey with him. She bore his child and is currently his spouse.

===Supporting characters===
* Leonard &quot;Stinky&quot; Brown, an old friend of Buddy&#x27;s from New Jersey who was his roommate in Seattle. Probably the most irresponsible, selfish and hopeless of all the characters. Adopts an alternative lifestyle as a means to furthering his sexual conquests.
* George Cecil Hamilton III, Buddy&#x27;s other roommate and über geek. Socially awkward, George hardly leaves his bedroom and immerses himself in science fiction and conspiracy theories.
* Valerie Russo, Buddy&#x27;s first serious girlfriend, an upper middle class, apparently self-confident feminist with nymphomaniacal and manic depressive tendencies.
* Jay Spano, an old friend of Buddy&#x27;s whom he met at a record store. He is a decade older than Buddy and uses heroin from time to time but claims not to be an addict. Buddy goes into business with Jay in collectables and later as scrap metal dealers.
* Jimmy Foley, Buddy&#x27;s next door neighbor in New Jersey, a small-time criminal serving out his probation for selling cocaine.
* Buddy&#x27;s family

==Cultural impact==
Matthew J. Pustz has called &quot;Hate&quot; &quot;The ultimate Generation X fable&quot;. Bagge managed to create archetypes with whom his audience identified strongly, which contributed to the popularity of the series.
There was a great deal of interaction between fans of &quot;Hate&quot;, Bagge and the characters. In &quot;Hate&quot;#3, Bagge ran a competition to &quot;Win a Date With Stinky&quot;, to which many fans submitted artwork and photographs. Bagge included cartoon depictions of several of the entrants in the issues that followed.

In issue # 6, Bagge ran another contest, this time a &quot;Buddy Bradley Look-Alike Contest&quot; which hundreds entered. The winner was featured on the cover of issue 10. Bagge later wrote in an editorial that the winner had got in touch to tell him he was dating a woman named Valerie who was from Paris.

Peter Bagge played down the comics position in grunge culture, saying
==In other media==
&quot;Hate&quot; has been optioned as a movie or TV series numerous times, and in development as an animated series at MTV, HBO and Fox at various times since 1995. A pilot for an animated Hate series was made in 1995, directed by Steve Loter. It was animated by Rough Draft. The pilot wasn’t a success, and not much is known about it.

==International versions==

A Spanish language edition of &quot;Hate&quot;, translated to &quot;Odio&quot; (which means Hatred) was published by Ediciones La Cúpula starting in 1995.Before this Odio was serialised in Spanish magazine &quot;El Víbora&quot;. According to Gual Oscar and Jose A. Serrano, &quot;Odio&quot;, taking into account population difference was comparatively more successful in Spain than its USA counterpart (10,000 copies sold per issue in Spain compared to 30,000 copies per issue for the USA.). Benet Roman writing for the 14th annual Barcelona BCN International Comics Fair commented that &quot;Bagge ... knows how to capture some of the spirit of our time, using that most universal, affordable and difficult to produce medium: humor.&quot;

In Germany The first fifteen issues of &quot;Hate&quot; were translated for the German market and published by Carlsen Comics under the title &quot;Leck Mich!&quot; (literal: lick me!, possibly most closely translates to &quot;kiss it!&quot; as in kiss my ass). Later color editions of &quot;Hate&quot; were issued in 1998 by Jochen Enterprises under the title &quot;Krass&quot;/Kraß (a slang term, meaning phat, cool or rad – its conventional meaning is crass). It ran for seven issues before Jochen ceased trading. Bagge sanctioned the creation of new Buddy stories for the German edition, by artists such as Philip Taegert and Guido Sieber. Sieber moved the characters of Buddy and Lisa from Seattle to Berlin.

<doc id="258775" wikidata="Q312407" url="?curid=258775" title="John Dos Passos">
<text>John Roderigo Dos Passos (; January 14, 1896 – September 28, 1970) was an American novelist, most notable for his &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy.

Born in Chicago, Dos Passos graduated from Harvard College in 1916. He traveled widely as a young man, visiting Europe and southwest Asia, where he learned about literature, art, and architecture. During World War I, he was an ambulance driver for the American Volunteer Motor Ambulance Corps in Paris and Italy, before joining the United States Army Medical Corps as a private.

In 1920, his first novel, &quot;One Man&#x27;s Initiation: 1917&quot;, was published, and in 1925, his novel &quot;Manhattan Transfer&quot; became a commercial success. His &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy, which consists of the novels &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; (1930), &quot;1919&quot; (1932), and &quot;The Big Money&quot; (1936), was ranked by the Modern Library in 1998 as 23rd of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Written in experimental, non-linear form, the trilogy blends elements of biography and news reports to paint a landscape of early 20th-century American culture.

Beyond his writing, Dos Passos is known for his shift in political views. Following his experiences in World War I, he became interested in socialism and pacifism, which also influenced his early work. In 1928, he traveled to the Soviet Union, curious about its social and political experiment, though he left with mixed impressions. His experiences during the Spanish Civil War disillusioned him with left-wing politics while also severing his relationship with fellow writer Ernest Hemingway. By the 1950s, his political views had changed dramatically, and he had become more conservative. In the 1960s, he campaigned for presidential candidates Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon.

As an artist, Dos Passos created his own cover art for his books, influenced by the modernism of 1920s Paris. He died in Baltimore, Maryland. Spence&#x27;s Point, his Virginia estate, was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1971.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Dos Passos was the illegitimate son of John Randolph Dos Passos (1844–1917), a lawyer of half-Madeiran Portuguese descent, and Lucy Addison (Sprigg) Madison of Petersburg, Virginia. His father was married at the time and had a son several years older than John. As a child, John traveled extensively with his mother, who was sickly and preferred Europe.

John&#x27;s father married Lucy after the death of his first wife in 1910, when John was 14, but he refused to formally acknowledge John for another two years. John Randolph Dos Passos was an authority on trusts, and a staunch supporter of the powerful industrial conglomerates that his son expressly criticized in his fictional works during the 1920s and 1930s.

After he returned with his mother to the US, Dos Passos was enrolled in 1907 at the Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall), a private college-preparatory school in Wallingford, Connecticut, under the name John Roderigo Madison. His parents later arranged for him to travel with a private tutor on a six-month tour of France, England, Italy, Greece, and southwest Asia, to study the masters of classical art, architecture, and literature.

In 1912, Dos Passos enrolled in Harvard College, where he became friends with classmate e.e. cummings, who said there was a &quot;foreignness&quot; about Dos Passos, and that &quot;no one at Harvard looked less like an American.&quot;

Following his graduation &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1916, Dos Passos traveled to Spain to study art and architecture. In July 1917, with World War I raging in Europe, Dos Passos volunteered for the Sanitary Squad Unit (S.S.U.) 60 of the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps, along with friends Cummings and Robert Hillyer. Later, he also worked as a volunteer ambulance driver with the American Red Cross in north-central Italy.

By the late summer of 1918, Dos Passos had completed a draft of his first novel. At the same time, he had to report for duty with the U.S. Army Medical Corps at Camp Crane in Pennsylvania. On Armistice Day, he was stationed in Paris, where the U.S. Army Overseas Education Commission allowed him to study anthropology at the Sorbonne. &quot;Three Soldiers&quot;, his novel drawn from those experiences, features a character who has virtually the same military career as the writer and stays in Paris after the war.

==Literary career==
Considered one of the Lost Generation writers, Dos Passos published his first novel in 1920, &quot;One Man&#x27;s Initiation: 1917&quot;, which was written in the trenches during World War I. It was followed by the antiwar novel, &quot;Three Soldiers&quot;, which brought him considerable recognition. His 1925 novel about life in New York City, titled &quot;Manhattan Transfer&quot;, was a commercial success, and introduced experimental stream-of-consciousness techniques. Those ideas also coalesced into the &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy, of which the first book appeared in 1930.

A social revolutionary, Dos Passos came to see the United States as two nations, one rich and one poor. He wrote admiringly about the Industrial Workers of the World, and the injustice in the criminal convictions of Sacco and Vanzetti, and joined with other notable figures in the United States and Europe in a failed campaign to overturn their death sentences. In 1928, Dos Passos spent several months in Russia studying socialism. He was a leading participant in the April 1935 First Americans Writers Congress, sponsored by the Communist-leaning League of American Writers, but he eventually balked at the idea that Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, would have control over creative writers in the United States.

In 1936–1937, Dos Passos served on the American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky, commonly known as the &quot;Dewey Commission&quot;, with other notable figures such as Sidney Hook, Reinhold Niebuhr, Norman Thomas, Edmund Wilson, and chairman John Dewey. It had been set up following the first of the Moscow &quot;Show Trials&quot; in 1936, part of the massive purges of Soviet party leaders and intellectuals in that period.

In the following year, he wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;The Devil Is a Woman&quot;, starring Marlene Dietrich and directed by Josef von Sternberg, both exiles from Nazi Germany. It was adapted from the 1898 novel &quot;La Femme et le pantin&quot; by Pierre Louÿs.

In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, Dos Passos returned to Spain with writer Ernest Hemingway, whom he had met in Paris in the 1920s. However, his views on the Communist movement had already begun to change. Dos Passos broke with Hemingway and Herbert Matthews over what he considered their cavalier attitude towards the war, and their willingness to lend their names to deceptive Stalinist propaganda efforts, including the cover-up of the Soviet responsibility in the murder of José Robles, Dos Passos&#x27;s friend and translator of his works into Spanish. (In later years, Hemingway would give Dos Passos the derogatory moniker of &quot;the pilot fish&quot; in his memoir of 1920s Paris, &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;.)

Of Communism, Dos Passos later wrote: &quot;I have come to think, especially since my trip to Spain, that civil liberties must be protected at every stage. In Spain, I am sure that the introduction of GPU methods by the Communists did as much harm as their tank men, pilots, and experienced military men did good. The trouble with an all-powerful secret police in the hands of fanatics, or of anybody, is that once it gets started, there&#x27;s no stopping it until it has corrupted the whole body politic. I am afraid that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in Russia.&quot;

Dos Passos had attended the 1932 Democratic National Convention and subsequently wrote an article for &quot;The New Republic&quot; in which he harshly criticized the selection of Franklin Delano Roosevelt as the party&#x27;s nominee. In the mid-1930s, he wrote a series of scathing articles about Communist political theory. In his novel &quot;The Big Money&quot;, he features a character who is an idealist Communist gradually worn down and destroyed by groupthink in the party. As a result of socialism gaining popularity in Europe in response to the rise of fascism and Nazism, there was a sharp decline in international sales of his books.

Between 1942 and 1945, Dos Passos worked as a journalist and war correspondent, covering American operations in the Pacific and the post-World War II situation in Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich and Vienna.

In 1947, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Tragedy struck the same year when an automobile accident killed his wife of 18 years, Katharine Foster Smith, and cost him the sight in one eye. The couple had no children. Dos Passos married Elizabeth Hamlyn Holdridge (1909–1998) in 1949, by whom he had one daughter, Lucy Hamlin Dos Passos (b. 1950).

His politics, which had always underpinned his work, moved to the right, and Dos Passos came to have a qualified, and temporary, sympathy for the goals of Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950s. However, his long-time friend journalist John Chamberlain believed that &quot;Dos always remained a libertarian.&quot;

In the 1950s, Dos Passos also contributed to publications such as the history magazine &quot;American Heritage&quot;, for which he wrote essays on Thomas Jefferson, the Marquis de Sade, Aaron Burr, and Robert Morris, the libertarian journal &quot;The Freeman&quot; and the conservative magazine &quot;National Review&quot;.

In the same decade, he published the influential study &quot;The Head and Heart of Thomas Jefferson&quot; (1954), about which fellow ex-radical Max Eastman wrote: &quot;I think John Dos Passos has done a great service to his country and the free world by lending his talents to this task. He has revived the heart and mind of Jefferson, not by psychoanalytical lucubrations or soulful gush, but in the main by telling story after story of those whose lives and thoughts impinged upon his. And Jefferson&#x27;s mind and heart are so livingly related to our problems today that the result seems hardly to be history.&quot;

Recognition for his significant contributions to literature came 30 years later in Europe, when, in 1967, he was invited to Rome to accept the prestigious Antonio Feltrinelli Prize for international distinction in literature. Although Dos Passos&#x27;s partisans have contended that his later work was ignored because of his changing politics, some critics argue that the quality of his novels declined following &quot;U.S.A.&quot;.

In the 1960s, he actively campaigned for Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign and Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s 1960 and 1968 presidential campaigns, and became associated with the group Young Americans for Freedom. He continued to write until his death in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1970. He is interred in Yeocomico Churchyard Cemetery in Cople Parish, Westmoreland County, Virginia, near where he had made his home.

Over his long career, Dos Passos wrote over forty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, and plays, and created more than 400 pieces of art.

==&quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy==

Dos Passos&#x27;s major work is the &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy, comprising &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; (1930), &quot;1919&quot; (1932), and &quot;The Big Money&quot; (1936). Dos Passos used experimental techniques in these novels, incorporating newspaper clippings, autobiography, biography, and fictional realism to paint a vast landscape of American culture during the first decades of the 20th century. Though each novel stands on its own, the trilogy is designed to be read as a whole. Dos Passos&#x27;s political and social reflections in the novel are deeply pessimistic about the political and economic direction of the United States, and few of the characters manage to hold onto their ideals through the First World War. The novel reflects the writer&#x27;s sympathy, at the time of writing, for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and his outrage at its suppression, for which the book expresses a deep grudge against President Woodrow Wilson. 

==Artistic career==
Before becoming a leading novelist of his day, Dos Passos sketched and painted. During the summer of 1922, he studied at Hamilton Easter Field&#x27;s art colony in Ogunquit, Maine. Many of his books published during the ensuing ten years used jackets and illustrations that Dos Passos created. Influenced by various movements, he merged elements of Impressionism, Expressionism, and Cubism to create his own unique style. And his work evolved with his first exhibition at New York&#x27;s National Arts Club in 1922 and the following year at Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney&#x27;s Studio Club in New York City.

While Dos Passos never gained recognition as a great artist, he continued to paint throughout his lifetime and his body of work was well respected. His art most often reflected his travels in Spain, Mexico, North Africa, plus the streets and cafés of the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris that he had frequented with good friends like Fernand Léger and Ernest Hemingway, as well as Blaise Cendrars, whose work he translated into English and who inspired him to use the montage techniques found in the &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy.

Between 1925 and 1927, Dos Passos wrote plays as well as created posters and set designs for the New Playwrights Theatre in New York City. In his later years, his attention turned to painting scenes around his residences in Maine and Virginia.

In early 2001, an exhibition titled &quot;The Art of John Dos Passos&quot; opened at the Queens Borough Library in New York City. It toured to several locations throughout the United States.

==Influence==
Dos Passos&#x27;s pioneering works of nonlinear fiction were a major influence in the field. In particular Alfred Döblin&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; and Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Roads To Freedom&quot; trilogy show the influence of his methods. In a 1936 essay, &quot;On John Dos Passos and 1919&quot;, Sartre referred to Dos Passos as &quot;the greatest writer of our time.&quot;

American writer Mary McCarthy said that &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; was among the chief influences on her own work. In the television documentary, &quot;The Odyssey of John Dos Passos&quot; (1994), writer Norman Mailer said: &quot;Those three volumes of U.S.A. make up the idea of a &#x27;Great American Novel.

Science fiction writers have also been influenced by Dos Passos&#x27;s works. John Brunner&#x27;s &quot;non-novel&quot; &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; (1968), which won the Hugo Award, features his technique of using fictitious newspaper clippings, television announcements, and other &quot;samples&quot; taken from the news and entertainment media of the year 2010. While influenced by Dos Passos&#x27;s technique, Brunner&#x27;s work was also inspired by emerging European literary theory on metafiction. Joe Haldeman&#x27;s novel &quot;Mindbridge&quot; (2014) also uses the collage technique. His short story &quot;To Howard Hughes: A Modest Proposal&quot; (1974) explored a wealthy man reacting to the threat of war by wielding the power of private atomic reaction.

The British documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis says he has been inspired by Dos Passos and tries to incorporate his technique in film: &quot;Why I love Dos Passos is he tells political stories but at the same time he also lets you know what it feels like to live through them. Most journalism does not acknowledge that people live at least as much in their heads as they do in the world.&quot;

In a 2018 interview, French director Agnès Varda spoke on her inspirations, &quot;I learned a lot from reading. I learned editing from Dos Passos. I learned the structure of writing from Fontenay. I learned poetry from Prévert.

==Dos Passos Prize==
The John Dos Passos Prize is a literary award given annually by the Department of English and Modern Languages at Longwood University. The prize seeks to recognize &quot;American creative writers who have produced a substantial body of significant publication that displays characteristics of John Dos Passos&#x27; writing: an intense and original exploration of specifically American themes, an experimental approach to form, and an interest in a wide range of human experiences.&quot;

<text>Norman Mattoon Thomas (November 20, 1884 – December 19, 1968) was an American Presbyterian minister, political activist, and perennial candidate for president. He achieved fame as a socialist and pacifist, and was the Socialist Party of America&#x27;s candidate for president in six consecutive elections between 1928 and 1948.

==Early years==
Thomas was the oldest of six children, born November 20, 1884, in Marion, Ohio, to Emma Williams (née Mattoon) and Weddington Evans Thomas, a Presbyterian minister. Thomas had an uneventful Midwestern childhood and adolescence, helping to put himself through Marion High School as a paper carrier for Warren G. Harding&#x27;s &quot;Marion Daily Star&quot;. Like other paper carriers, he reported directly to Florence Kling Harding. &quot;No pennies ever escaped her,&quot; said Thomas. The summer after he graduated from high school his father accepted a pastorate at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, which allowed Norman to attend Bucknell University. He left Bucknell after one year to attend Princeton University, the beneficiary of the largesse of a wealthy uncle by marriage. Thomas graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in 1905.

After some settlement house work and a trip around the world, Thomas decided to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and enrolled in Union Theological Seminary. He graduated from the seminary and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1911. After assisting the Rev. Henry Van Dyke at the fashionable Brick Presbyterian Church on Manhattan&#x27;s Fifth Avenue, Thomas was appointed pastor of the East Harlem Presbyterian Church, ministering to Italian-American Protestants. Union Theological Seminary had been at that time a center of the Social Gospel movement and liberal politics, and as a minister, Thomas preached against American participation in the First World War. This pacifist stance led to his being shunned by many of his fellow alumni from Princeton, and opposed by some of the leadership of the Presbyterian Church in New York. When church funding of the American Parish&#x27;s social programs was stopped, Thomas resigned his pastorate. Despite his resignation, Thomas did not formally leave the ministry until 1931, after his mother&#x27;s death.

It was Thomas&#x27;s position as a conscientious objector that drew him to the Socialist Party of America (SPA), a staunchly antimilitarist organization. When SPA leader Morris Hillquit made his campaign for mayor of New York in 1917 on an antiwar platform, Thomas wrote to him expressing his good wishes. To his surprise, Hillquit wrote back, encouraging the young minister to work for his campaign, which Thomas energetically did. Soon thereafter he himself joined the Socialist Party. Thomas was a Christian socialist.

Thomas was the secretary (then an unpaid position) of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation even before the war. When the organization started a magazine called &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; in January 1918, Thomas was employed as its paid editor. Together with Devere Allen, Thomas helped to make &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; the leading voice of liberal Christian social activism of its day. In 1921, Thomas moved to secular journalism when he was employed as associate editor of &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine. In 1922 he became co-director of the League for Industrial Democracy. Later, he was one of the founders of the National Civil Liberties Bureau, the precursor of the American Civil Liberties Union.

==Electoral politics==

Thomas ran for office five times in quick succession on the Socialist ticket—for governor of New York in 1924, for mayor of New York in 1925, for New York State Senate in 1926, for alderman in 1927, and for mayor of New York again in 1929. In 1934, he ran for the US Senate in New York and polled almost 200,000 votes, then the second-best result for a Socialist candidate in New York state elections; only Charles P. Steinmetz polled more votes, almost 300,000 in 1922 when he ran for State Engineer.

Thomas&#x27;s political activity also included attempts at the US presidency. Following Eugene Debs&#x27;s death in 1926, there was a leadership vacuum in the Socialist Party. Neither of the party&#x27;s two top political leaders, Victor L. Berger and Hillquit, was eligible to run for president because of their foreign birth. The third main figure, Daniel Hoan, was occupied as mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Down to approximately 8,000 dues-paying members, the Socialist Party&#x27;s options were limited, and the little-known minister from New York with oratorial skills and a pedigree in the movement became the choice of the 1928 National Convention of the Socialist Party.

The 1928 campaign was the first of Thomas&#x27;s six consecutive campaigns as the presidential nominee of the Socialist Party. As an articulate and engaging spokesman for democratic socialism, Thomas had considerably greater influence than the typical perennial candidate, but never achieved Debs&#x27;s level of popularity, topping out at 2.23% of the vote in the realignment election of 1932. Although most upper- and middle-class Americans found socialism unsavory, the well-educated Thomas—who often wore three-piece suits and looked and talked like a president—gained grudging admiration.

Thomas frequently spoke on the difference between socialism, the movement he represented, and communism and revolutionary Marxism. His early admiration for the Russian Revolution had turned into energetic anti-Stalinism. (Some revolutionaries thought him no better; Leon Trotsky criticized Thomas on more than one occasion.)

He wrote several books, among them his passionate defense of World War I conscientious objectors, &quot;Is Conscience a Crime?&quot;, and his statement of the 1960s social democratic consensus, &quot;Socialism Re-examined&quot;.

==Socialist Party politics==
At the 1932 Milwaukee convention, Thomas and his radical pacifist allies in the party joined forces with constructive socialists from Wisconsin and a faction of young Marxist intellectuals called the &quot;Militants&quot; in backing a challenger to National Chairman Morris Hillquit. While Hillquit and his cohort retained control of the organization at this time, this action earned the lasting enmity of Hillquit&#x27;s New York-based allies of the so-called &quot;Old Guard&quot;. The diplomatic party peacemaker Hillquit died of tuberculosis the following year, lessening the stability of his faction.

At the 1934 National Convention of the Socialist Party, Thomas&#x27;s connection with the Militants deepened when he backed a radical Declaration of Principles authored by his longtime associate from the radical pacifist journal &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, Devere Allen. The Militants swept to majority control of the party&#x27;s governing National Executive Committee at this gathering, and the Old Guard retreated to their New York fortress and formalized their factional organization as the Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party, complete with a shadow Provisional Executive Committee and an office in New York City.

Thomas favored work to establish a broad Farmer–Labor Party upon the model of the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, but remained supportive of the Militants and their vision of an &quot;all-inclusive party&quot;, which welcomed members of dissident communist organizations (including Lovestoneites and Trotskyists) and worked together with the Communist Party USA in joint Popular Front activities. The party descended into a maelstrom of factionalism in the interval, with the New York Old Guard leaving to establish themselves as the Social Democratic Federation of America, taking with them control of party property, such as the Yiddish-language &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot;, the English-language &quot;New Leader&quot;, the Rand School of Social Science, and the party&#x27;s summer camp in Pennsylvania.

In 1937, Thomas returned from Europe determined to restore order in the Socialist Party. He and his followers in the party teamed up with the Clarity majority of the National Executive Committee and gave the green light to the New York Right Wing to expel the Appeal faction from the organization. These expulsions led to the departure of virtually the whole of the party&#x27;s youth section, who affiliated to the new Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party. Demoralization set in and the Socialist Party withered, its membership level below that of 1928.

In April 1938, Thomas was the center of national controversy when he came to Jersey City, New Jersey to defend labor organizers&#x27; free speech and challenge the political machine of Mayor Frank Hague. Hague was a close ally of Franklin Roosevelt and controlled federal patronage in the state. Though denied a permit for political reasons, Thomas came anyway to speak at an outdoor rally. The police arrested him as soon as he got out of his car. As the officers prepared to expel him from the city, Thomas quipped, &quot;So this is Jersey justice&quot;. People across the political spectrum, including the 1932 and 1936 Republican presidential nominees, Herbert Hoover and Alfred M. Landon, criticized Hague for his suppression of free speech and Roosevelt for his silence about the incident. Thomas and Landon became good friends as a result of the incident.

==Causes==

Thomas was initially as outspoken in opposing the Second World War as he had been with regard to the First World War. Upon returning from a European tour in 1937, he formed the Keep America Out of War Congress, and spoke against war, thereby sharing a platform with the non-interventionist America First Committee. In the 1940 presidential campaign he said Republican Wendell Willkie was the candidate of &quot;the Wall Street war machine&quot; and that he &quot;would take us to war about as fast and about on the same terms as Mr. Roosevelt&quot;.

In testimony to Congress in January 1941 he opposed the proposed Lend Lease program of sending military supplies to Great Britain, calling it &quot;a bill to authorize undeclared war in the name of peace, and dictatorship in the name of defending democracy&quot;. He said that the survival of the British Empire was not vital to the security of the United States, but added that he favored helping Britain to defend herself against aggression.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, a bitter split took place in the Socialist Party regarding support for the war; Thomas reluctantly supported it, though he thought it could have been honorably avoided. His brother and many others continued their pacifist opposition to all wars. Thomas later wrote self-critically that he had &quot;overemphasized both the sense in which it was a continuance of World War I and the capacity of nonfascist Europe to resist the Nazis&quot;.

Thomas was one of the few public figures to oppose President Roosevelt&#x27;s incarceration of Japanese Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. He accused the ACLU of &quot;dereliction of duty&quot; when the organization supported the forced mass removal and incarceration. Thomas also campaigned against racial segregation, environmental depletion, and anti-labor laws and practices, and in favor of opening the United States to Jewish victims of Nazi persecution in the 1930s.

Thomas was an early proponent of birth control. The birth-control advocate Margaret Sanger recruited him to write &quot;Some Objections to Birth Control Considered&quot; in &quot;Religious and Ethical Aspects of Birth Control&quot;, edited and published by Sanger in 1926. Thomas accused the Catholic Church of hypocritical opinions on sex, such as requiring priests to be celibate and maintaining that laypeople should have sex only to reproduce. &quot;This doctrine of unrestricted procreation is strangely inconsistent on the lips of men who practice celibacy and preach continence.&quot;

Thomas also deplored the secular objection to birth control because it originated from &quot;racial and national&quot; group-think. &quot;The white race, we are told, our own nation—whatever that nation may be—is endangered by practicing birth control. Birth control is something like disarmament—a good thing if effected by international agreement, but otherwise dangerous to us in both a military and economic sense. If we are not to be overwhelmed by the &#x27;rising tide of color&#x27; we must breed against the world. If our nation is to survive, it must have more cannon and more babies as prospective food for the cannon.&quot;

Thomas was also very critical of Zionism and of Israel&#x27;s policies toward the Arabs in the postwar years (especially after the Suez Crisis) and often collaborated with the American Council for Judaism.

==Later years==
After 1945, Thomas sought to make the anti-Stalinist left the leader of social reform, in collaboration with labor leaders like Walter Reuther. In 1961, he released an album, &quot;The Minority Party in America: Featuring an Interview with Norman Thomas&quot;, on Folkways Records, which focused on the role of the third party.

Thomas actively campaigned for Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 presidential election. He was critical of Johnson&#x27;s foreign policy, but praised his work on civil rights and poverty. Thomas called Johnson&#x27;s opponent Barry Goldwater a &quot;personable man with good stands on domestic issues&quot; but also described him as &quot;the greatest evil&quot; due to his views on foreign policy.

Thomas&#x27;s 80th birthday in 1964 was marked by a well-publicized gala at the Hotel Astor in Manhattan. At the event Thomas called for a cease-fire in Vietnam and read birthday telegrams from Hubert Humphrey, Earl Warren, and Martin Luther King Jr. He also received a check for $17,500 () in donations from supporters. &quot;It won&#x27;t last long,&quot; he said of the check, &quot;because every organization I&#x27;m connected with is going bankrupt.&quot;

In 1966, the conservative journalist and writer William F. Buckley, Jr chose Thomas to be the third guest on Buckley&#x27;s new television interview show, &quot;Firing Line&quot;. In 1968, Thomas signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

Also in 1966, Thomas traveled to the Dominican Republic along with future Congressman Allard K. Lowenstein to observe that country&#x27;s general election. The two were leaders of the &quot;Committee on free elections in the Dominican Republic&quot;, an organization based in the U.S. that monitored the election, in which Juan Bosch of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, affiliated with the Socialist International, was beaten closely but decisively by the conservative ex-president Joaquín Balaguer. Balaguer continued to govern the country on and off for the next 30 years. In the autumn of that year, Thomas received the second Eugene V. Debs Award for his work in promoting world peace.

==Personal life==
In 1910, Thomas married Frances Violet Stewart (1881–1947), the granddaughter of John Aikman Stewart, financial adviser to Presidents Lincoln and Cleveland, and a trustee of Princeton for many years. Together, they had three daughters and two sons:
* Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Thomas (1914–2010), who married Herbert C. Miller Jr, a professor and chairman of pediatrics at the University of Kansas
* Frances Thomas (1915–2015), who married John W. Gates, Jr. (died 2006)
* Rebekah Thomas (1918–1986), who married John D. Friebely
* William Stewart Thomas (1912–1988)
* Evan Welling Thomas II (1920–1999), who married Anna Davis (née Robins) in 1943
** Evan Welling Thomas III (b. 1951)

===Death===
Thomas died at the age of 84 on December 19, 1968, at a nursing home in Huntington, New York. Pursuant to his wishes, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered on Long Island.

===Legacy===
The Norman Thomas High School (formerly known as Central Commercial High School) in Manhattan and the Norman Thomas &#x27;05 Library at Princeton University&#x27;s Forbes College are named after him, as is the assembly hall at the Three Arrows Cooperative Society, where he was a frequent visitor. He is also the grandfather of &quot;Newsweek&quot; columnist Evan Thomas and the great-grandfather of writer Louisa Thomas.

A plaque in the Norman Thomas &#x27;05 Library reads: Norman M. Thomas, class of 1905. &quot;I am not the champion of lost causes, but the champion of causes not yet won.&quot;

<doc id="258777" wikidata="Q1340737" url="?curid=258777" title="Peter Bagge">
<text>Peter Bagge (pronounced , as in &quot;bag&quot;; born December 11, 1957) is an American cartoonist whose best-known work includes the comics &quot;Neat Stuff&quot; and &quot;Hate&quot;. His stories often use black humor and exaggerated cartooning to dramatize the reduced expectations of middle-class American youth. He won two Harvey Awards in 1991, one for best cartoonist and one for his work on &quot;Hate&quot;. In recent decades Bagge has done more fact-based comics, everything from biographies to history to comics journalism. Publishers of Bagge&#x27;s articles, illustrations, and comics include suck.com, &quot;MAD Magazine&quot;, toonlet, &quot;Discover&quot;, and the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;, with the comic strip &quot;Adventures of Batboy&quot;. He has expressed his libertarian views in features for &quot;Reason&quot;.

==Early life==
Peter Bagge was born in Peekskill, New York, and grew up in the New York City suburbs. Bagge&#x27;s father was in the military and Bagge has talked about how his Catholic household was the scene of &quot;lots of drunken fights about money. We were the weirdo outcast kids of the neighborhood. I couldn&#x27;t get away fast enough.&quot; Bagge was confirmed as a teenager; his confirmation name is Peter Christian Paul Bagge (with Paul being an homage to Paul McCartney.)

Moving to New York City in the mid-1970s, Bagge attended the School of Visual Arts for three semesters in 1977 before dropping out to work on &quot;Punk&quot; magazine.

==Career==
===Comics===
====Early career====
Bagge began his career in New York City in the early 1980s, contributing comics and illustrations to various underground newspapers and pornography magazines. 

In 1980–1981, Bagge co-published the all-comics tabloid &quot;Comical Funnies&quot; with former staffers of &quot;Punk&quot; magazine (including John Holmstrom). Bagge sent copies of &quot;Comical Funnies&quot; to underground comics legend R. Crumb, who published some Bagge strips in the anthology Crumb was editing, &quot;Weirdo&quot;. Bagge contributed to many issues of &quot;Weirdo&quot; from that point forward, mostly illustrating stories written by Dave Carrino. In 1984, Crumb passed on the editorial reins of &quot;Weirdo&quot; to Bagge, who edited it for three years (and one guest issue in 1989).

In 1985, Bagge entered into a long professional association with the alternative-comics publisher Fantagraphics, beginning with his first solo series, &quot;Neat Stuff&quot;. This omnibus introduced such characters as Girly-Girl, Junior, Studs Kirby, The Bradleys, and Buddy Bradley. &quot;Neat Stuff&quot; ran until 1989. Its sequel series, &quot;Hate&quot; (1990–1998), is Bagge&#x27;s best-known. After ending &quot;Hate&quot; as a regular title, Bagge has produced a series of &quot;Hate&quot; Annuals between 2000 - 2010.

Bagge created and wrote an all-ages comic series for DC Comics called &quot;Yeah!&quot;, about an all-girl rock band, drawn by Gilbert Hernandez. The series ran nine issues (1999 to 2000). &quot;Sweatshop&quot;, published by DC Comics in 2003, was produced, unlike early issues of &quot;Hate&quot;, with the help of an art team. The series ran six issues.

Starting in 1998 (in a piece for &quot;Details&quot; magazine), and really intensely in the years 2000 to 2002, Bagge did a number of comics journalism stories—on such topics as politics, the Miss America Pageant, bar culture, Christian rock, and the Oscars—mostly for suck.com.

In 2002, Bagge did his version of Spider-Man for Marvel Comics. He followed this with a Hulk comic, &quot;The Incorrigible Hulk&quot;, which was completed but never released due to a management change at Marvel Comics at the time. In August 2009, &quot;The Incorrigible Hulk&quot; was finally released in serialized form for the Marvel Knights imprint&#x27;s &quot;Strange Tales&quot; miniseries.

====2005 – present====
From 2005 to 2007, Bagge worked on &quot;Apocalypse Nerd&quot;, a comic published by Dark Horse Comics about two average, urban males dealing with the aftermath of a nuclear attack on the Pacific Northwest. Backup stories in &quot;Apocalypse Nerd&quot; featured historically researched anecdotal tales of America&#x27;s Founding Fathers. The final issue of the six-issue series was published in 2007. A trade paperback collection was released in 2008.

&quot;Other Lives&quot; is a graphic novel written and drawn by Bagge, and published by DC Comics on their Vertigo imprint in 2010. The story revolves around four people, whose real lives—along with their online virtual personas—interact in ultimately disastrous ways.

&quot;Reset&quot; is a four-part, monthly comic-book miniseries written and illustrated by Bagge and published by Dark Horse Comics. The story revolves around a middle-aged, washed-up comic actor who agrees to take part in the development of a computer application that allows him to relive his life in a virtual sense. The first issue was released in April 2012. It was collected into a book that same year.
Starting with the February 2009 issue, the popular science and technology magazine &quot;Discover&quot; has featured a continuing series of History of Science comic strips created by Peter Bagge. Bagge&#x27;s comics feature key characters and events from scientific history.

Bagge is the subject of the first volume of TwoMorrows Publishing&#x27;s new &quot;Comics Introspective&quot; series of books, published in 2007. &quot;Peter Bagge: Conversations&quot;, a collection of interviews with Bagge spanning three decades was published 2015 by the University Press of Mississippi.

His graphic-novel biographies include &quot;Woman Rebel&quot;, about birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, &quot;Fire!!&quot;, about writer Zora Neale Hurston, and &quot;Credo&quot;, about author and political theorist Rose Wilder Lane.

In 2003, Bagge became a contributing writer with the libertarian magazine &quot;Reason&quot; in whose pages he has published both prose and comics pieces over the years. 2009 saw the release of a collection of Bagge&#x27;s Reason work called &quot;Everybody Is Stupid Except for Me (And Other Astute Observations)&quot;. A second edition was released in late 2013. Bagge continues to contribute to &quot;Reason&quot;.

===Animation and music===
Bagge made a series of animated commercials for Round Table Pizza. In 2001 Bagge collaborated with comedian Dana Gould to produce the Macromedia Flash Internet cartoon &quot;Murry Wilson: Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Dad&quot;. The four-episode series premiered on Icebox.com.

Bagge also played drums for the Seattle based power pop band The Action Suits, and guitar for another power pop band, Can You Imagine.

==Art style==
Bagge&#x27;s signature elastic, kinetic art style is a product of his love for 1940s Warner Brothers cartoons (especially those directed by Bob Clampett). Bagge has said that he &quot;always wanted to capture that sense of movement and exaggeration in a static format. In retrospect this sounds like a futile thing to attempt, but I think I wound up pulling it off better than I ever thought I would.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bagge&#x27;s wife Joanne contributes coloring work to her husband&#x27;s publications.

Bagge has long been openly libertarian in his politics, and many of his comics feature references to this. He opposed the Iraq War and criticized George W. Bush. Bagge voted for Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne in 2000 and Democrat John Kerry in 2004 because he &quot;wanted to fire Bush.&quot; When asked who he was voting for in the 2008 election, he wrote: &quot;If the polls in my home state are close: Obama (McCain is simply too incompetent these days to be president). If not, I&#x27;ll make a protest vote for [Bob] Barr.&quot; In a follow-up article in &quot;Reason&quot;, Bagge stated, &quot;I wound up voting for Barr, and I stand by &quot;that&quot; vote more now than I did then!&quot;

Bagge collected his work for &quot;Reason&quot; expressing his Libertarian views in the book &quot;Everybody is Stupid Except Me: and Other Astute Observations.&quot; Bagge has continued with his strips covering libertarian issues in &quot;Hate Annual&quot;.

==Awards==
Bagge won the 1991 Harvey Award for Best Cartoonist. In addition, &quot;Hate&quot; won the 1991 Harvey Award for Best New Series, and has been nominated for various Harvey awards in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999.

<text>The Kingdom of Naples (; ; ) was a state that ruled the part of the Italian Peninsula south of the Papal States between 1282 and 1816. It was established by the War of the Sicilian Vespers (1282–1302), when the island of Sicily revolted and was conquered by the Crown of Aragon, becoming a separate kingdom also called the Kingdom of Sicily. This left the Neapolitan mainland under the possession of Charles of Anjou. Later, two competing lines of the Angevin family competed for the Kingdom of Naples in the late 14th century, which resulted in the murder of Joanna I at the hands of her successor, Charles III of Naples. Charles&#x27; daughter Joanna II adopted King Alfonso V of Aragon as heir, who would then unite Naples into his Aragonese dominions in 1442.

As part of the Italian Wars, France briefly ruled the territory in 1494 and at the beginning of the 16th century; it then went to war with Spain over the kingdom in 1502, a conflict that ended in a victory for Ferdinand II, who was in full control of the kingdom by 1504. The Spanish held control of Naples throughout the 17th century where it remained an important source of economic and military power for the Spanish Crown. After the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 18th century, the possession of the kingdom again changed hands; the 1714 Treaty of Rastatt saw Naples given to Charles VI of the Austrian Habsburgs. However, Naples and Sicily were conquered by Charles, Duke of Parma (of the Spanish Bourbons) during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, he was then installed as King of Naples and Sicily from 1735. In 1816, Naples formally unified with the island of Sicily to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

The Kingdom of Naples was one of the largest and most important Italian states throughout all its history. Its territory corresponded to the current Italian regions of Campania, Calabria, Apulia, Basilicata, Abruzzo, Molise, and also included some areas of today&#x27;s southern and eastern Lazio.

==Nomenclature==

The term &quot;Kingdom of Naples&quot; is in near-universal use among historians, but it was not used officially by the government. Since the Angevins remained in power on the Italian peninsula, they kept the original name of the Kingdom of Sicily (). At the end of the War of the Vespers, the Peace of Caltabellotta (1302) provided that the name of the kingdom would be the Kingdom of Sicily had become known colloquially as the Kingdom of Naples ( or ).

In the late Middle Ages, it was common to distinguish the two Sicilies by noting its location relative to the rest of Italy and the , i.e., the Strait of Messina. The peninsular kingdom was known as Sicily or (&#x27;on this side of Faro&#x27;), and the island kingdom was known as Sicily or (on the other side of Faro). When both kingdoms came under the rule of Alfonso the Magnanimous in 1442, this usage became official, although Ferdinand I (1458–94) preferred the simple title King of Sicily ().

In the 18th century, the Neapolitan intellectual Giuseppe Maria Galanti argued that Apulia was the true &quot;national&quot; name of the kingdom. By the time of Alfonso the Magnanimous, the two kingdoms were sufficiently distinct that they were no longer seen as divisions of a single kingdom. Despite being repeatedly in personal union, they remained administratively separate. In 1816, the two kingdoms finally merged to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

==History==
===Background===
Naples, which was the capital of the Duchy of Naples since the 7th century, surrendered to Roger II of Sicily in 1137, and was annexed to the Kingdom of Sicily. The Normans were the first to bring political unity to southern Italy in the centuries after the failure of the Byzantine effort to reconquer Italy. The Normans established a kingdom that included southern mainland Italy and the island of Sicily, which was primarily ruled from Palermo. The title of &quot;King of Sicily&quot; was established by the Antipope Anacletus II as early as 1130 and subsequently legitimized, in 1139, by Pope Innocent II. Since the royal titles over the State had been assigned to the Normans by Innocent II, the popes, in particular Pope Innocent III and Pope Innocent IV, claimed the feudal rights of the Church State over the Kingdom. After Constance, Queen of Sicily married Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, the region was inherited by their son Frederick II, as King of Sicily. The region that later became the separate Kingdom of Naples under the Angevins formed part of the Kingdom of Sicily, which included the island of Sicily and Apulia.

===Angevin dynasty===
Following the rebellion in 1282, King Charles I of Sicily (Charles of Anjou) was forced to leave the island of Sicily by Peter III of Aragon&#x27;s troops. Charles, however, maintained his possessions on the mainland, customarily known as the &quot;Kingdom of Naples&quot;, after its capital city.

Charles and his Angevin successors maintained a claim to Sicily, warring against the Aragonese until 1373, when Queen Joan I of Naples formally renounced the claim by the Treaty of Villeneuve. Joan&#x27;s reign was contested by Louis the Great, the Angevin King of Hungary, who captured the kingdom several times (1348–1352).

Queen Joan I also played a part in the ultimate demise of the first Kingdom of Naples. As she was childless, she adopted Louis I, Duke of Anjou, as her heir, in spite of the claims of her cousin, the Prince of Durazzo, effectively setting up a junior Angevin line in competition with the senior line. This led to Joan I&#x27;s murder at the hands of the Prince of Durazzo in 1382, and his seizing of the throne as Charles III of Naples.

The two competing Angevin lines contested each other for the possession of the Kingdom of Naples over the following decades. In 1389 Louis II of Anjou son of Louis I managed to seize the throne from Ladislas of Naples son of Charles III, but was expelled by Ladislas in 1399. Charles III&#x27;s daughter Joanna II (r. 1414–1435) adopted Alfonso V of Aragon (whom she later repudiated) and Louis III of Anjou as heirs alternately, finally settling succession on Louis&#x27; brother René of Anjou of the junior Angevin line, and he succeeded her in 1435.

René of Anjou temporarily united the claims of junior and senior Angevin lines. 

===Aragonese dynasty===
In 1442, Alfonso V conquered the Kingdom of Naples and unified Sicily and Naples once again as dependencies of Aragon. At his death in 1458, the War of the Neapolitan Succession (1458–1462) erupted, after which the kingdom was again separated and Naples was inherited by Ferdinand I, Alfonso&#x27;s illegitimate son.

When Ferdinand I died in 1494, Charles VIII of France invaded Italy, using as a pretext the Angevin claim to the throne of Naples, which his father had inherited in 1481 on the will of Charles IV of Anjou, nephew and heir of King René who had no surviving son. This began the Italian Wars.

===From French rule to Spanish viceroyalty===

Charles VIII expelled Alfonso II of Naples from Naples in 1495, but was soon forced to withdraw due to the support of Ferdinand II of Aragon for his cousin, Alfonso II&#x27;s son Ferrantino. Ferrantino was restored to the throne but died in 1496 and was succeeded by his uncle, Frederick IV.

Charles VIII&#x27;s successor, Louis XII reiterated the French claim. In 1501, he occupied Naples and partitioned the kingdom with Ferdinand of Aragon, who abandoned his cousin King Frederick. However, disputes over ownership of key Neapolitan territories made the deal quickly fall through, and Aragon and France resumed their war over the kingdom in 1502. The Spanish troops occupying Calabria and Apulia, led by Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova, invaded and expelled all Frenchmen from the area. The resulting Aragonese victory left Ferdinand in full control of the kingdom by 1504 and Naples became a constituent kingdom of the Crown of Aragon.

The peace treaties that continued were never definitive, but they established at least that the title of King of Naples was reserved for Ferdinand&#x27;s grandson, the future Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Ferdinand nevertheless continued in possession of the kingdom, being considered the legitimate heir of his uncle Alfonso I of Naples (Alfonso V of Aragon) and also to the former Kingdom of Sicily (&quot;Regnum Utriusque Siciliae&quot;).

The kingdom continued to be disputed between France and Spain for the next several decades, but French efforts to gain control of it became feebler as Habsburg power grew, and never genuinely endangered Spanish control.

===Spanish rule===

The French finally abandoned their claims to Naples by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559. In the Treaty of London (1557), five cities on the coast of Tuscany were designated the &quot;Stato dei Presidi&quot; (State of the Presidi), and part of the Kingdom of Naples.

As the most populous holding of the Spanish Empire outside of Castile itself (with 3 million inhabitants in 1600), Naples remained an important source of economic and military power for the Spanish. Heavy taxation was levied upon the kingdom to pay for Spain&#x27;s wars, especially after 1580. Beyond dispatching troops to fight the Eighty Years&#x27; War in the Low Countries, Naples also disbursed a third of the military expenditures accruing to the Spanish controlled Duchy of Milan and paid for the Spanish garrisons in Tuscany. This cost the kingdom 800,000 ducats annually, or about a third of the kingdom&#x27;s revenues; moreover, the public debt also had a military origin, and interest payments on it devoured 40 percent of all tax income. Naples was rich enough to redeem the debt and pay an attractive ten percent in full to lenders. While the soldiers of Naples were under the command of the Spanish viceroy, Neapolitan nobles enjoyed ascendancy in the assemblies and committees that financed and administered the army.

The kingdom suffered a heavy burden from the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659). From 1631 to 1636 alone, Naples sent 53,500 soldiers and 3.5 million scudi to support the Spanish king. This was actually more than was raised in the same time by Castile, which had a population twice the size. Naples provided and paid for 10,000 troops and 1,000 horses annually from 1630 to 1643, on top of a 1 million ducat annual subsidy for the war effort and more funds and soldiers for the kingdom&#x27;s garrisons and navy. The kingdom was increasingly forced to revert to borrowing to finance the war as it went on, which it could do due to its good credit. From 1612 to 1646, Neapolitan taxes tripled and the public debt quintupled, and 57 percent of the kingdom&#x27;s revenue was devoted to interest payments. Spain&#x27;s wars crushed the Neapolitan economy. Furthermore, 90 percent of taxes were collected by state creditors, meaning the state paid an effective interest rate of 70 percent annually on the money it borrowed to fight the war. The kingdom started selling state assets to anyone willing to buy them, which usually ended up being barons; these assets included prisons, forests, buildings, and even royal fortresses, and titles.

Due to this excessive taxation the people of Naples rose in revolt in 1647, forming the Neapolitan Republic with French assistance. The revolt was suppressed later that year by Spanish troops.

===Austrian Habsburgs and Bourbons===
After the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 18th century, possession of the kingdom again changed hands. Under the terms of the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714, Naples was given to Charles VI, the Holy Roman Emperor. He also gained control of Sicily in 1720, but Austrian rule did not last long. Both Naples and Sicily were conquered by a Spanish army during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, and Charles, Duke of Parma, a younger son of King Philip V of Spain, the first member of the French House of Bourbon to rule in Spain, was installed as King of Naples and Sicily from 1735. When Charles inherited the Spanish throne from his older half-brother in 1759, he left Naples and Sicily to his younger son, Ferdinand IV. Despite the two Kingdoms being in a personal union under the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, they remained constitutionally separate.

Being a member of the House of Bourbon, Ferdinand IV was a natural opponent of the French Revolution and Napoleon. On 29 November 1798, he effectively started the War of the Second Coalition by briefly occupying Rome, but was expelled from it by French Revolutionary forces within the year and safely returned home. Soon afterwards, on 23 December 1798, Ferdinand fled Naples to Palermo as a French army closed in. In January 1799, the French armies installed a Parthenopaean Republic, but this proved short-lived, and a peasant counter-revolution inspired by the clergy allowed Ferdinand to return to his capital. However, in 1801 Ferdinand was compelled to make important concessions to the French by the Treaty of Florence, which reinforced France&#x27;s position as the dominant power in mainland Italy.

===Napoleonic kingdom===

Ferdinand&#x27;s decision to ally with the Third Coalition against Napoleon in 1805 proved more damaging. In 1806, following decisive victories over the allied armies at Austerlitz and over the Neapolitans at Campo Tenese, Napoleon installed his brother, Joseph as King of Naples, he conferred the title &quot;Prince of Naples&quot; to be hereditary on his children and grandchildren. When Joseph was sent off to Spain two years later, he was replaced by Napoleon&#x27;s sister Caroline and his brother-in-law Marshal Joachim Murat.

Meanwhile, Ferdinand had fled to Sicily, where he retained his throne, despite successive attempts by Murat to invade the island. The British would defend Sicily for the remainder of the war but despite the Kingdom of Sicily nominally being part of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Coalitions against Napoleon, Ferdinand and the British were unable to ever challenge French control of the Italian mainland.

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1814, Murat reached an agreement with Austria and was allowed to retain the throne of Naples, despite the lobbying efforts of Ferdinand and his supporters. However, with most of the other powers, particularly Britain, hostile towards him and dependent on the uncertain support of Austria, Murat&#x27;s position became less and less secure. Therefore, when Napoleon returned to France for the Hundred Days in 1815, Murat once again sided with him. Realising the Austrians would soon attempt to remove him, Murat gave the Rimini Proclamation hoping to save his kingdom by allying himself with Italian nationalists.

The ensuing Neapolitan War between Murat and the Austrians was short, ending with a decisive victory for the Austrian forces at the Battle of Tolentino. Murat was forced to flee, and Ferdinand IV was restored to the throne of Naples. Murat would attempt to regain his throne but was quickly captured and executed by firing squad in Pizzo, Calabria. The next year, 1816, finally saw the formal union of the Kingdom of Naples with the Kingdom of Sicily into the new Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

<doc id="258783" wikidata="Q7448178" url="?curid=258783" title="Self-proclaimed monarchy">
<text>A self-proclaimed monarchy is established when a person claims a monarchy without any historical ties to a previous dynasty. In many cases, this would make them a pretender to the throne (when a ruling dynasty is already established). The self-proclaimed monarch may be of an established state, such as Zog I of Albania, or of a micronation, such as Leonard Casley of Hutt River, Western Australia.

==Past self-proclaimed monarchies==
===Albania===
In 1928, Ahmet Zogu, a president of Albania, proclaimed himself &quot;King Zog I&quot;. He ruled for 11 years in a nominally constitutional monarchy that was overthrown in the Italian invasion of Albania.

=== Andorra ===
In 1934, Boris Skossyreff declared himself &quot;Boris I, King of Andorra&quot;. His pretended reign only lasted a few days. He was expelled when he declared war on Justí Guitart i Vilardebó, Bishop of Urgell and ex officio co-prince of Andorra.

=== Australia ===
In 1970, after a dispute over wheat production quotas, Leonard Casley proclaimed his wheat farm in Western Australia the &quot;Principality of Hutt River&quot;, styling himself as &quot;HRH Prince Leonard I of Hutt&quot;. The Australian government did not recognize his claim of independence. Casley abdicated in 2017, passing the principality to his son, &quot;Prince Graeme I&quot;. The principality formally dissolved in 2020.

===Cameroon===
Lekeaka Oliver was a separatist rebel commander who fought in the Anglophone Crisis. In 2019, he proclaimed himself &quot;Paramount Ruler&quot; or &quot;King&quot; of Lebialem, a department of Cameroon. This move was condemned both by Cameroonian loyalists as well as other rebels. Oliver was killed in 2022.

===Central African Republic===
In 1976, a short-lived &#x27;Imperial&#x27; monarchy, the &quot;Central African Empire&quot;, was created when dictator Jean-Bédel Bokassa of the Central African Republic proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor Bokassa I&quot;. The following year, he held a lavish coronation ceremony. He was deposed in 1979.

===Chile===

In 1860, a French adventurer, Orélie-Antoine de Tounens, proclaimed the &quot;Kingdom of Araucanía&quot; in Chile with the support of local Mapuche chiefs. He called himself &quot;Orélie-Antoine I&quot;. In 1862, he was arrested and deported by the Chilean government.

=== China ===
Hong Xiuquan proclaimed himself the leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom during the Taiping Rebellion in 1851.

In 1915, the president of China, Yuan Shikai, declared a restoration of the Chinese monarchy, with himself as emperor. The plan failed, and he was forced to step down.

Since then, there have been repeated attempts by individuals to declare themselves Chinese emperor or empress. In the 1920s and 1930s, there were several peasant rebels who declared themselves members of House of Zhu and tried to restore the Ming dynasty, such as the self-proclaimed emperors &quot;Chu the Ninth&quot; (1919–1922, backed by the Yellow Way Society), &quot;Wang the Sixth&quot; (1924), and Chu Hung-teng (1925, backed by the Heavenly Gate Society). In course of the Spirit Soldier rebellions (1920–1926), a former farm worker and rebel leader named Yuan declared himself the &quot;Jade Emperor&quot;. Following the Chinese Civil War, there have been hundreds of monarchist pretenders who oppose the Chinese Communist Party and often gathered small groups of supporters. Notable self-proclaimed monarchs include: Li Zhu, declared a new dynasty in 1954; Song Yiufang, leader of the Nine Palaces Way (crowned by his followers after sneaking into the Forbidden City in 1961); Yang Xuehua, empress of the Heavenly Palace Sect (arrested in 1976 and executed after allegedly planning a rebellion); Chao Yuhua, empress of the &quot;Great Sage Dynasty&quot; (crowned in 1988 in a factory); Tu Nanting, ex-soldier and emperor (believed in his emperorship after reading several books on prophecies, the arcane, and morals); Yang Zhaogong who attempted to establish a new dynasty with alleged backing of CCCPC members. In general, these self-proclaimed monarchs were not very successful and quickly arrested by security forces. However, one self-proclaimed emperor, Li Guangchang, organized a large sect of supporters and factually governed a small territory in Cangnan County, called the &quot;Zishen Nation&quot;, from 1981 to 1986 in &quot;de facto&quot; independence from China. He was eventually arrested, reportedly after attempting to organize a wider rebellion.

=== Congo ===
Within days of being independent from Belgium, the new Republic of the Congo found itself torn between competing political factions, as well as by foreign interference. As the situation deteriorated, Moise Tshombe declared the independence of Katanga Province as the State of Katanga on 11 July 1960. Albert Kalonji, claiming that the Baluba were being persecuted in the Congo and needed their own state in their traditional Kasai homeland, followed suit shortly afterwards and declared the autonomy of South Kasai on 8 August, with himself as head. On 12 April 1961, Kalonji&#x27;s father was granted the title &quot;Mulopwe&quot; (which roughly translates to &quot;emperor&quot; or &quot;god-king&quot;), but he immediately &quot;abdicated&quot; in favor of his son. On 16 July, but retained the title of &quot;Mulopwe&quot; and changed his name to Albert I Kalonji Ditunga. The move was controversial with members of Kalonji&#x27;s own party and cost him much support.

Shortly thereafter, as preparation for the invasion of Katanga, Congolese government troops invaded and occupied South Kasai, and Kalonji was arrested. He escaped, but South Kasai ultimately returned to the Congo.

=== France ===
In 1736, Freiherr Theodor Stephan von Neuhof established himself as King of Corsica in an attempt to free the island of Corsica from Genoese rule.

In 1804, French Consul Napoleon Bonaparte proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor Napoleon I&quot;. Although this imperial regime ended with his fall from power, Napoleon&#x27;s nephew, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, was elected in 1848 as President of France. In 1852, he declared himself &quot;Emperor Napoleon III&quot;; he was deposed in 1870.

=== Haiti ===

In 1804, in Haiti, the governor general, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor Jacques I&quot;. He ruled for two years. In 1811, the president, Henry Christophe, proclaimed himself &quot;King Henri I&quot; and ruled until 1820. In 1849, the president, Faustin Soulouque, proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor Faustin I&quot; and ruled until 1859.

=== Mexico ===
On 19 May 1822, Agustín Cosme Damián de Iturbide y Arámburu, was crowned as Emperor of Mexico. He was a Mexican-born general who had served in the Spanish Army, during the Mexican War of Independence, but switched sides and joined the Mexican rebels in 1820. He was proclaimed president of the Regency in 1821. When King Ferdinand VII of Spain refused to become a constitutional monarch, Iturbide was crowned Emperor. He ruled Mexico for less than as a year as he abdicated and went into exile during a revolt in March 1823. He returned to Mexico on 14 July 1824 and was executed by the Provisional Government of Mexico.

=== Romania ===
Florin Cioabă proclaimed himself King of the Roma Everywhere. He died in 2013.

=== Philippines ===
In 1823, in Manila, Philippines, a regimental captain, Andrés Novales, staged a mutiny and proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor of the Philippines&quot;. After one day, Spanish troops from Pampanga and Intramuros removed him.

=== Trindade ===
In 1893, James Harden-Hickey, an admirer of Napoleon III, crowned himself &quot;James I of the Principality of Trinidad&quot;. For two years he tried but failed to assert his claim.

===United States===
In 1850, James J. Strang, who claimed to be Joseph Smith&#x27;s successor as leader of the Latter Day Saint movement, proclaimed himself king of his followers on Beaver Island, Michigan. On 8 July 1850, he was crowned in an elaborate coronation ceremony. Strang evaded Federal government charges of treason and continued to rule until 1856, the year he was assassinated by two disgruntled &quot;Strangites&quot;.

In 1859, Joshua Abraham Norton, a failed businessman from San Francisco, declared himself &quot;Emperor of the United States&quot;, followed by assuming the additional title &quot;Protector of Mexico&quot; in 1863 in the wake of France&#x27;s invasion of the country; he became and remained a local celebrity for the rest of his life.

==Current self-proclaimed monarchies==

===Italy===
The Principality of Seborga () is a micronation that claims a area located in the northwestern Italian Province of Imperia in Liguria, near the French border, and about from Monaco. The principality is in coexistence with, and claims the territory of, the town of Seborga. In the early 1960s, Giorgio Carbone, began promoting the idea that Seborga restore its historic independence as a principality. By 1963 the people of Seborga were sufficiently convinced of these arguments to elect Carbone as their Head of State. He then assumed the style and title &quot;His Serene Highness&quot; Giorgio I, Prince of Seborga, which he held until his death in 2009. The Principality of Seborga is an elective monarchy and elections are held 
every seven years. The subsequent monarch was Prince Marcello Menegatto (Prince Marcello I) who ruled from 2010 to 2019. On 23 April 2017, Prince Marcello was re-elected and took office for another seven years, but abdicated the throne in 2019. Nina Menegatto was elected head of state as Princess Nina on 10 November 2019.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1967, Paddy Roy Bates, a former major in the British Army, took control of Roughs Tower, a Maunsell sea fort situated off the coast of Suffolk and declared it the &quot;Principality of Sealand&quot;. Upon his death in 2012, &quot;Prince&quot; Paddy Roy Bates was succeeded by his son, Michael. 

=== Canada ===
Romana Didulo, a Filipina–Canadian woman, claimed to be the &quot;secret Queen of Canada&quot; in June 2021, and amassed a cult-like following, mainly consisting of right-wing QAnon supporters, being followed by 17,000 users of Telegram, a messaging platform favoured by the far-right and QAnon figures. She and her followers began to hand out &quot;cease and desist&quot; letters, demanding people and businesses stop following Canadian COVID-19 restrictions.

In an introductory video on Telegram, Didulo claimed to be &quot;the founder and leader of Canada1st&quot;, an unregistered political party, and &quot;the head of state and commander in chief of Canada, the Republic&quot;. She alleged that Canada&#x27;s actual head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, had been secretly executed and that she had been appointed as Queen by &quot;the same group of people who have helped president Trump&quot;, in reference to a common belief within the QAnon conspiracy theory. In reality, Elizabeth II died of natural causes on September 8, 2022.

<doc id="258789" wikidata="Q3539556" url="?curid=258789" title="Triple sec">
<text>Triple sec is an orange-flavoured liqueur that originated in France. It usually contains 20–40% alcohol by volume.

Triple sec is rarely consumed neat, but is used in preparing many mixed drinks such as margaritas, cosmopolitans, sidecars, Long Island iced teas, and mai tais.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name &quot;triple sec&quot; is disputed. The term is French and composed of &quot;triple&quot;, with the same meaning as in English, and &quot;sec&quot;, the French word for &quot;dry&quot;. Some sources claim it comes from a triple distillation process used to create the liqueur, but others say that a triple distillation is not used. Cointreau, a brand of triple sec, is reported to have invented the term based on the three types of orange peels used in the liqueur, although other reports have Cointreau claim the triple to mean &quot;three times the flavour of Curaçaos.&quot;

==History==

Triple sec has been popular for more than 150 years. The Dutch East India Company created orange liqueurs by steeping dried orange peels from places such as the island of Curaçao. Unlike the modern-day triple sec, which contains only the flavor of orange peel, the Dutch version includes herbs and spices, and comes in a variety of colors such as clear, orange, or blue.

The Combier distillery claims that Jean-Baptiste Combier and his wife Josephine invented triple sec in 1834, in their kitchen in Saumur, France. Orange liqueur was rising in popularity after the Dutch introduced Curaçao, and the Combiers sought to create a version that would be true to the orange fruit, they wanted it to be crisp and clean, with orange essential oils as the main feature. To achieve this, the Combier family used bitter oranges that were native to Haiti, and sweet Valencia oranges to balance the flavor. The liqueur was made by sun-drying the various orange peels. After at least 48 hours, they would begin distilling this mixture in copper pots. Lastly, they would put them through a third distillation, to purify the flavor.

In 1875, Cointreau created its version of triple sec and calls itself one of the most popular brands. Triple sec gained popularity and was widely known by 1878; at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, several distillers were offering &quot;Curaço triple sec&quot;, as well as &quot;Curaço doux&quot;.

== Production ==
Triple sec is usually made from a spirit derived from sugar beet (used because of its neutral flavor), in which orange peel is steeped. The oranges are harvested when their skin is still green and not fully ripened, so the essential oils remain in the skin rather than the fruit&#x27;s flesh. The spirit is redistilled and mixed with more neutral spirit, water, and powdered beet sugar, resulting in the final liqueur. This process creates a spirit that has a robust and distinct orange flavor.

<doc id="258790" wikidata="Q641965" url="?curid=258790" title="2010 Winter Paralympics">
<text>The 2010 Winter Paralympics (), or the tenth Paralympic Winter Games, were held in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, from March 12 to 21, 2010. The opening ceremony took place in BC Place Stadium in Vancouver and the Closing Ceremony in Whistler Medals Plaza.

This was the first time Canada hosted the Winter Paralympic Games and second time it hosted the Paralympics – the first was the 1976 Summer Paralympics in Toronto.

On June 7, 2006, Prince Edward, as a member of the Canadian Royal Family and patron of the British Paralympic Association, raised the flag of the Paralympic Games outside Vancouver City Hall.

Brian McKeever of Canada became the first athlete to be named in a Winter Paralympics and Winter Olympics team in the same year, although he did not compete in the Olympic Games. (At the 2010 Winter Olympics, he was scheduled to compete in the men&#x27;s 50 km cross-country race, but the coach replaced him with a skier who did well at an earlier event.) At the Paralympics, he competed in cross-country skiing and biathlon.

Viviane Forest became the first Paralympian to win a gold in both the Winter and Summer Games, by winning the women&#x27;s downhill for visually impaired. She had previously won gold in the 2000 and 2004 Summer Paralympics for women&#x27;s goalball. Canadian Lauren Woolstencroft won 5 gold medals in alpine skiing, the most gold medals won by any Canadian Winter Paralympian at a single Games. Also German Verena Bentele won 5 gold medals, in biathlon and cross-country skiing, and with that number they set the gold medal record for the 2010 Games.

== Bidding process ==

As part of a formal agreement between the International Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee first established in 2001, the winner of the bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics was also to host the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Following the second and final round of voting at the 115th IOC Session in Prague, Czech Republic, the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics were awarded to Vancouver.

==Development and preparation==
===Torch relay===
The same torch design (silver with Paralympic logo) used for the Olympics was used for the Paralympic Games. On March 3, 2010, the torch began a 10-day journey from Ottawa to Vancouver. The relay involved approximately six hundred runners to carry the torch across ten Canadian cities in three provinces:

* Ottawa – March 3
* Quebec City – March 4
* Toronto, Ontario – March 5
* Esquimalt, BC and Victoria, BC – March 6
* Squamish, BC – March 7
* Whistler, BC – March 8
* Lytton and Hope, BC – March 9
* Vancouver (Riley Park) and Maple Ridge, BC – March 10
* Vancouver (University of British Columbia), BC – March 11
* Vancouver, BC – March 12 (24-hour relay)

===Venues===
Venues for the 2010 Winter Paralympics were shared between Vancouver and Whistler, as with the 2010 Winter Olympics.

;Competition venues

;Non-competition venues

===Marketing===
When the mascot, Sumi, an animal guardian spirit with the wings of the Thunderbird and legs of a black bear, was introduced, it was the first time the Olympic and Paralympic mascots were introduced at the same time.

To commemorate the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games, 17 Canadian coins were issued for general circulation. Two of the circulation coins honour Paralympic sports: wheelchair curling (released on July 11, 2007) and ice sledge hockey (released on March 18, 2010). The circulation quarters omitted a traditional phrase, Dei Gratia Regina, from their obverse side, making them the first godless coins in circulation since 1911.

==The games==

===Opening ceremonies===
With a theme of &quot;One inspires many,&quot; the opening ceremony featured over 5000 local performers. Fifteen-year-old snowboarder Zach Beaumont, who is an amputee, was the final torch bearer and lit the Games Cauldron. The 2 hours live ceremony was produced by Vancouver-based Patrick Roberge Productions Inc.

===Participating nations===
Forty-four National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) entered athletes at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. This was an increase of five from the 39 represented at the 2006 Winter Paralympics. The number in parentheses indicates the number of participants from each NPC.

A total of 506 athletes participated in the Games. This is an increase from the 476 athletes who participated in 2006.

Argentina and Romania took part in the Winter Paralympic Games for the first time, as did Bosnia and Herzegovina. All three have previously participated in several editions of the Summer Paralympics. Serbia also made its Winter Paralympics début as a distinct NPC, following its split with Montenegro.

Despite the overall increase of delegates and athletes, Latvia, which participated in Turin for the 2006 Winter Paralympics, did not send athletes to Vancouver.

===Sports===
Five sports were on the 2010 program:

===Podium sweeps===
==Broadcasters==
In Canada, the games were broadcast by Canada&#x27;s Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium, a joint venture between CTVglobemedia and Rogers Media. The networks aired a greater amount of coverage than what had been shown in previous years, a total of 50 hours of coverage. Coverage included including a daily 90-minute highlight program, and live coverage of select sledge hockey matches (games involving Canada, plus the gold medal game) on CTV. The opening ceremony was broadcast live on CTV&#x27;s Vancouver station CIVT-TV, followed by an encore aired nationally on CTV and Réseau Info Sports the following afternoon. While not originally planned, CTV and RDS also aired live coverage of the closing ceremony.

The games were aired on Universal Sports in the United States.

Paralympic Sport TV (paralympicsport.tv), the Internet TV channel of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), offered international free online live and recorded coverage of the games, every day from 9:00 to 22:30 PST.

In New Zealand, SKY TV broadcast one hour of highlights each day, and full coverage of New Zealand athletes.

In the United Kingdom, BBC broadcast the Games, but only through the red button and online.

In Europe, Eurosport broadcast live the medal events in biathlon, alpine and cross-country skiing.

In France, France Télévisions provided live coverage on its website.

In Italy, Sky Sport provided record coverage with all games live on five dedicated HD channels.

In Australia, ABC1 broadcast the games.

In Norway, NRK broadcast the games. 30 hours of the Games were broadcast live. NRK-sport were critical to parts of the TV production from Vancouver, an issue they&#x27;ve notified to the EBU. Issues such as showing biathlon without showing the shooting, and in cross-country skiing there were numerous panorama shots of the same mountain area with skiers in the distance, making it hard to follow the progress of the competition. NRK were far more pleased with the production of the ice sledge hockey and wheelchair curling events, which they felt reached the same level as the Olympic Games.

===Paralympic media awards===
New Zealand&#x27;s Sky Sport won the best broadcast award for their coverage of the Games. Gary Kingston writing for the Vancouver Sun took the best written category. While Jeff Crow won the best photography category for his picture of Shannon Dallas.

==Mascots==

The mascot of the 2010 Winter Paralympics is Sumi, who has the wings of a thunderbird and the legs of a black bear, accompanied by his marmot sidekick, Mukmuk.

==Legacy==
In the winter sports season following the games, there was a notable increase in winter disability sports participation throughout British Columbia.

<doc id="258795" wikidata="Q7624458" url="?curid=258795" title="Strong Bad">
<text>Strong Bad is a fictional character from &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;, a series of animated Flash videos, who is inspired by &quot;The Strong Bads&quot; from the video game &quot;Tag Team Wrestling&quot;. He is voiced by Matt Chapman, the principal voice actor and co-creator of the series. Strong Bad enjoys pranking the other characters of the series, along with his ever-diligent lackey pet The Cheat and his older brother Strong Mad. Strong Bad first became popular due to his own segment on the Homestar Runner website, called &quot;Strong Bad Emails&quot;. The &quot;Strong Bad Email&quot; series grew to be so popular that six DVDs featuring the emails have been released, as well as a podcast where emails could be downloaded to digital media players, since its first episode in 2001.

Strong Bad was created to be the main antagonist of the series but since then has become less of a villain and more of an antihero. However, he is still occasionally referred to as an antagonist, due to the pranks that he, Strong Mad, and The Cheat play on the other characters, and his insulting of his brother Strong Sad. He seems to be a character influenced by the American popular culture trends of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, such as heavy metal music and the second and third-generations of video games and video game consoles. Since he is one of the site&#x27;s most popular characters, merchandise has also spun off of Strong Bad, which includes T-shirts and sweatshirts sold by the website.

Strong Bad has been one of the most popular characters in the series and has been well-received. In 2021, &quot;Polygon&quot; declared Strong Bad an icon. In a tribute, they note that &quot;Strong Bad Email was far and away the most popular segment on Homestar Runner&quot; and the series and character have &quot;remained a &quot;massive comedic influence&quot; on others. Segments have been spun off of his emails, including &quot;Teen Girl Squad&quot;, a comic drawn by Strong Bad about four teenage friends, and &quot;20X6&quot;, an anime-style cartoon featuring Japanese versions of the characters, such as Strong Bad&#x27;s counterpart, &quot;Stinkoman&quot;.

==Role in &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;==
In the original &quot;The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest &quot;book, as well as many of the early cartoons, Strong Bad mainly served as the antagonist to Homestar Runner. The two would frequently compete against each other in competitions, with Strong Bad often cheating. As the series drew away from competition-based stories and became more character-driven, Strong Bad became less of a villain; although he still dislikes Homestar and often tries to prank him, he mostly just views him as dim-witted and irritating. The two have been known to occasionally get along, however. 

Along with his physically intimidating but mentally limited big brother Strong Mad and his yellow lackey The Cheat, Strong Bad represents the self-proclaimed criminal element in the series. Many shorts concern the various practical jokes and scams that they perpetrate. Although these are usually only slightly malevolent, Strong Bad still acts as if he is a villainous mastermind, and he is highly prone to exaggerating his alluring qualities—especially with regards to women. Strong Bad also &quot;rules&quot; an area of the fictional universe called Strong Badia. It consists of a barren field, a fence, a tire, and a stop sign reading &quot;Pop: Tire&quot; (Pop meaning population) leaning against a cinder block. Besides Strong Badia, he and The Cheat enjoy hanging out at a stick known as &quot;The Stick&quot;.

===Strong Bad Email===
Strong Bad&#x27;s main role in the cartoon is in the &quot;Strong Bad Email&quot; segment, in which he answers emails sent to him from viewers. The Strong Bad Emails began as a small segment in 2001, in which Strong Bad would mock the spelling and grammar of those who wrote to him, usually while typing with boxing gloves on an outdated computer. The question of how he types with boxing gloves on has become a running gag due to the frequency of emails concerning it, and seems to annoy Strong Bad. Most of the time a cut-away sequence is used to move the narrative beyond mere typing. Once the events of the email finish unfolding, Strong Bad wraps it up, and then &quot;The Paper&quot; or &quot;New Paper&quot; comes down with a link to Strong Bad&#x27;s e-mail address. Often, hidden animations (Easter eggs) are displayed when the user clicks on a word or picture either during the email or after it has concluded. As of 2022, there are 209 Strong Bad emails. Although the animations were initially brief, they gradually grew to establish numerous catchphrases and running gags. His most used catchphrase was &quot;Holy Crap!&quot; and other variations on this theme (example: &quot;What the crap?&quot;), though he now parodies even this in his responses to emails. 

====Trogdor====
Trogdor the Burninator is an original character created by Strong Bad in the 58th Strong Bad Email, titled &quot;dragon&quot;. The cartoon features Strong Bad giving an Ed Emberley-inspired drawing tutorial to the viewer, illustrating a fire-breathing serpent with incongruous details including stick-figure feet and a single, large muscular arm. His fire-breathing destruction is referred to with the term &quot;burnination&quot;.

The Trogdor character became very popular, with merchandise featuring the dragon consistently being the best-selling in the store. Trogdor was featured on several games on the website, and accompanied by a memorable song in his first appearance. He featured as the main antagonist of the final episode of &quot;Strong Bad&#x27;s Cool Game for Attractive People&quot;, &quot;8-Bit is Enough&quot;. In 2018, board game &quot;Trogdor!! The Board Game&quot; was funded via a Kickstarter campaign.

References to Trogdor have appeared throughout pop culture, with the &quot;Trogdor&quot; theme featured as a bonus song in &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot; and the dragon being mentioned in the finale of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

===Spinoffs===
A recurring element of &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; is the re-imagining of the cast and world of the cartoon into a different genre. Variations of Strong Bad feature prominently in many of these series, such as the 1930s-themed &quot;Old-Timey Strong Bad&quot;, the comic book superhero &quot;Strong Badman&quot;, or the anime-styled &quot;Stinkoman&quot;. 

Many elements of &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; spun off from Strong Bad Emails, such as cartoon series Teen Girl Squad or characters Trogdor the Burninator and Homsar.

==Character==

===Creation===
Along with several other &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; main characters, Strong Bad debuted in the 1996 parody children&#x27;s book &quot;The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest&quot;. The storybook focuses on friends The Homestar Runner and Pom-Pom entering a strongman competition, opposed by the cheating Strong Bad. 

Seeking to design an obvious villain, inspiration came from &quot;evil&quot; masked wrestlers such as Mil Máscaras, Mr. Wrestling II, and most prominently the &quot;Strong Bads&quot; team from the NES video game &quot;Tag Team Wrestling&quot;. Strong Bad was therefore drawn as a stereotypical luchador, with a red-and-black mask, boxing gloves, tights, and going shirtless.

A few photocopies of the small, handmade book were distributed among friends, there was no serious attempt to publish or otherwise capitalize on it. Strong Bad would not be revisited for several years; in 1999, the brothers wanted to learn to use Flash and returned to the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; characters as an outlet to do so.

===Development===
The earliest &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; cartoons revolved around the titular Homestar Runner taking part in athletic competitions, opposed by the villainous Strong Bad. The Brothers Chaps soon decided to instead focus on humorous moments taking place &quot;between&quot; competitions, which allowed for Strong Bad to be developed further in cartoon series like &quot;Marzipan&#x27;s Answering Machine&quot; and &quot;Strong Bad Email&quot;.

Strong Bad quickly became the site&#x27;s breakout character, with Mike Chapman noting that fans seemed to enjoy &quot;how he rags on everyone, but isn&#x27;t very threatening.&quot; The Brothers Chaps decided to give him his own segment, Strong Bad Email (abbreviated as &quot;sbemail&quot;) beginning in 2001; originally established as a brief, advice column-like format merely featuring Strong Bad typing at a computer, the format quickly evolved to more complex mini-cartoons. &quot;Strong Bad Email&quot; became a runaway success for the website: by early 2002 Strong Bad was already receiving hundreds of emails a day, peaking at eight thousand daily emails in the summer of 2003 before leveling off to two thousand a day.

Strong Bad started off with a prominent Mexican accent and a deep voice, which gradually transitioned into a more gruff and less-accented voice with more vocal range.

==Reception==
Strong Bad has been received well by both critics and viewers of the website. He is considered one of the most popular characters of the website, and his &quot;Strong Bad Email&quot; segment is one of the most viewed segments of &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;. In an audio review of Strong Bad and the rest of the Homestar Runner characters, National Public Radio said &quot;There are lots of nasty characters lurking in the shadowy corners of the World Wide Web. But Strong Bad is just awful. And he&#x27;s awfully funny, too&quot;. Peter Wood of National Review Online commented on Strong Bad&#x27;s personality and his evil-looking appearance. He stated: &quot;Strong Bad is probably not the guy you want to move in next door. The red and black Wrestlemania mask he wears all the time is a clue. As are the boxing gloves, which he keeps on even when he is typing sarcastic e-mails ... He is one of the coolest characters on the Internet and the real star of Homestarrunner.com, which may be the most popular homegrown animation in the world.&quot; He added &quot;Strong Bad also dabbles in other media and, like Professor Cornel West, has even recorded his own rap, &#x27;Everybody to the Limit&#x27;, which builds on the delightful typographic implosion, &#x27;fhqwhgads, and also said &quot;The humor likewise combines the innocence of slapstick with sharp satire of American popular culture. ... At one point, tired of being asked how he types with boxing gloves on, Strong Bad attaches fake fingers: a shrimp, a lit birthday candle, and an action-figure toy.&quot; Johnny Dee, a reviewer from &quot;The Guardian&quot; of the United Kingdom, described the humor of Strong Bad. He wrote: &quot;Like South Park and Modern Toss, Strong Bad isn&#x27;t exactly beautiful to look at but he&#x27;s relentlessly funny,&quot; and added, &quot;Strong Bad is an animated Mexican wrestler ... and the undoubted star of surreal cartoon site Homestar Runner.&quot;

===Video games===

&quot;Strong Bad&#x27;s Cool Game for Attractive People&quot; is a point-and-click adventure game based on &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; and starring Strong Bad. The game was created by Telltale Games in partnership with The Brothers Chaps, and released for both the Nintendo Wii&#x27;s WiiWare service and Microsoft Windows, later ported to PlayStation 3 as a PSN download and to OSX. It was released in an episodic format, with five episodes comprising the first season. No serious discussions or pre-production on a second season had taken place prior to Telltale&#x27;s closure in 2018.

Telltale Games also featured Strong Bad as a character in &quot;Poker Night at the Inventory&quot;. Released November 22, 2010, the game features Strong Bad alongside other video game characters (Tycho from &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, Heavy from &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, and Max from &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot;) as computer-controlled opponents playing Texas hold &#x27;em poker against the player. Telltale CEO Dan Connors described the game as &quot;exploring the idea of what video characters do when they&#x27;re not &#x27;on the clock&#x27; in the games we play.&quot; Matt Chapman provided input on the writing for Strong Bad.

===Music===
&quot;Strong Bad Sings (And Other Type Hits)&quot; is a 2003 album featuring new or re-recorded songs from the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; site. Although many songs are performed by Strong Bad, other bands and characters from &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; are featured as well.

Spoken word lines from Strong Bad were featured on the Shellac song &quot;Genuine Lulabelle&quot;, from the album &quot;Excellent Italian Greyhound&quot;.

Strong Bad makes a guest appearance on The Aquabats″ 2011 album &quot;Hi-Five Soup!&quot;, providing vocals on the song &quot;Pink Pants!&quot;. On July 14, 2012, Matt Chapman appeared onstage at an Aquabats concert in San Diego in character as Strong Bad, joining the band in a performance of &quot;Trogdor&quot;.

A three-volume &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; soundtrack was released to music streaming platforms on April 10, 2020. All songs are credited to &quot;Strong Bad&quot;, despite the fact that many are purportedly performed by other fictional characters or are simple instrumental pieces, as a result of limits on formatting compilation albums.

===Other media===
In 2011, Matt Chapman joined the production team of The Hub series &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot; as a writer and director. In the 2012 episode &quot;CobraMan!&quot;, co-directed by Chapman, he appears onscreen as a villainous carnival worker named &quot;Carl&quot;, who wears a wrestling mask identical to Strong Bad&#x27;s and speaks in Strong Bad&#x27;s voice.

<doc id="258800" wikidata="Q1341419" url="?curid=258800" title="Communist Party of Finland">
<text>The Communist Party of Finland (, SKP; ) was a communist political party in Finland. The SKP was a section of Comintern and illegal in Finland until 1944.

The SKP was banned by the state from its founding and did not participate in any elections with its own name. Instead, front organisations were used. In the 1920s, the communists took part in the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Finland (1920–1923) and the Socialist Electoral Organisation of Workers and Smallholders (1924–1930). Both of them were also banned. In 1944, a new front, the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League was formed. The SKP controlled these fronts but they always had a prominent minority of non-communist socialists.

==History==
===Early stages===
In 1918, the Reds lost the Finnish Civil War. The Social Democratic Party of Finland had supported the losing side, and several of its leaders were exiled in Soviet Russia. Some of these exiles founded the Communist Party of Finland in Moscow.

The SKP was illegal in Finland until 1944, and members could be imprisoned. After the Continuation War, the SKP dominated the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League, which was founded in 1944 as an umbrella organization of the radical left.

===Cold War===
The Cold War era was the high point of Communists in Finland. Between 1944 and 1979, support of the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League was in the range of 17%–24%. Communists participated in several cabinets, but Finland never had a communist Prime Minister or President. In the mid-1960s, the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 40,000 (1.44% of the working age population). with the SKP&#x27;s main rival for domination of the political left being the Social Democratic Party of Finland. The competition was very bitter in trade unions and other leftist organizations.

The SKP received substantial financial support from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Internally, SKP was divided, with a Eurocommunist mainstream and a hardline pro-Moscow minority, called the &quot;Taistoists&quot; after their leader, Taisto Sinisalo. The word &quot;taisto&quot; also means &quot;battle&quot; or &quot;fight&quot;; the double connotation made this slur, originally launched by the largest Finnish newspaper , stick. Soviet threats to withdraw support were the main reason why the majority did not expel the Taistoists from the party leadership or membership.

===Aftermath of the Prague Spring===
The events of the Prague Spring followed by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia had strong repercussions for the SKP. With the SKP&#x27;s leadership strongly denouncing the Soviet intervention, internal disputes became fiercer than ever. While a de facto Eurocommunist majority held sway, the Taistoist minority decisively stood by the Soviet Union and the Brezhnev doctrine. Gradually this led to a disintegration, and in practice, the party now consisted of two parallel structures, and gradually lost ground in terms of public support. The most hardline leader of the party, Markus Kainulainen, led a group that even opposed Soviet policies after the Perestroika had begun.

In 1985–1986, a large number of Taistoists, hundreds of party organizations with thousands of members, were expelled. They regrouped as the Communist Party of Finland (Unity) (SKPy) which later evolved into the current Communist Party of Finland (1994).

===Collapse===
The dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s led to ideological conflicts: bitter internal disputes plagued the party. Bad stock-market investments made during Arvo Aalto&#x27;s term of office resulted in financial bankruptcy in 1992. The SKP never recovered. A majority of the party members, with other member-organizations of SKDL, formed the Left Alliance in 1990.

SKPy, originally the faction of the party expelled in 1985–1986, outlasted its parent and registered itself as the Communist Party of Finland in 1997, but has failed to regain the former Communist Party&#x27;s parliamentary representation. In the elections of 2007 it won 0.7% of the vote; in April 2011, it won just 0.3%.

==Youth wing==
The youth wing of the SKP was the Communist Youth League of Finland (SKNL, 1925–1936). After World War II, young communists were active in the SKDL&#x27;s Democratic Youth League of Finland (SNDL). The SNDL was member of World Federation of Democratic Youth.

<text>Anthony Theodore Thompson (November 15, 1954 – November 12, 2003) was an American session drummer best known as the drummer of the Power Station and a member of Chic.

==Early life and education==
Thompson was raised in the middle-class community of Springfield Gardens, in Queens, New York, New York. His mother was Trinidadian and father was of Antiguan descent.

==Music career==
===Chic===
Thompson first drummed for the group Labelle, and then for a short while was a member of the soul/disco band Ecstasy, Passion &amp; Pain. This was followed by a long tenure with Chic, where he helped create hits such as &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah),&quot; &quot;Le Freak,&quot; and &quot;Good Times&quot;. He also performed with members of Chic on &quot;We Are Family&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s the Greatest Dancer&quot; by Sister Sledge and &quot;Upside Down&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot; by Diana Ross.

Following the temporary disbanding of Chic in 1983, Chic&#x27;s former guitarist and bassist, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards became prolific producers, and Thompson&#x27;s drumming was much in demand among their clients. Thompson appeared with numerous artists such as Jody Watley, Madonna (on her 1984 album &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;), Rod Stewart, Robert Palmer and David Bowie.

===Other bands===
Thompson was also a member of the band the Power Station along with Robert Palmer, and John Taylor and Andy Taylor of Duran Duran. The Live Aid charity benefit concert in 1985 saw Thompson filling in and playing with the Power Station as well as joining the remaining members of Led Zeppelin on stage (along with Phil Collins) at John F. Kennedy Stadium. Page, Plant and Jones then invited Thompson in England for rehearsals for a Led Zeppelin reunion which was canceled by Jimmy Page after Thompson was badly injured in a car crash.

He went on to join groups such as the Distance and Crown of Thorns with Jean Beauvoir (playing on their first album &quot;Crown of Thorns&quot; before leaving the band and subsequently replaced by Hawk Lopez). Thompson was also a founding member of the band That Hideous Strength. In the mid-1990s he rejoined Power Station for their 1996 reunion album &quot;Living in Fear&quot; and subsequent tour. Thompson&#x27;s final project was called Non-Toxic which he formed with bassist Michael Paige (Crown of Thorns) and guitarist Dave Scott; Thompson died before finishing the project&#x27;s first album.

He played with David Bowie on the Serious Moonlight Tour.

==Death and legacy==
Three days before his 49th birthday, Thompson died on November 12, 2003, in Los Angeles, within a month of being diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer), and two months after the death of the Power Station bandmate Robert Palmer from a heart attack. Thompson was a member of the band Non-Toxic at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife, two children, and his sister, Cookie. On September 19, 2005, like his former band member Bernard Edwards, Thompson was honoured posthumously along with the rest of the Chic band members by being inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame.

<text>Hot Gossip (1974–1986) was a British television dance troupe and recording group.

==Formation==
Arlene Phillips moved to London to teach American jazz dance routines, working at Pineapple Dance Studios and the Italia Conti Stage School. In 1974, Phillips started forming the core of a troupe; Italia Conti student actress Lesley Manville turned her down. Hot Gossip spent two years performing in Munkberry&#x27;s club in Jermyn Street, London W1, where Phillips and manager/producers Michael Summerton and Iain Burton developed the group&#x27;s act. Phillips, Summerton and Burton continued to work together for eight years.

==Career==

=== &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot; ===
British television director David Mallet invited Phillips to make Hot Gossip a regular feature of &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot; (Thames Television,1978–1981). Dancers in this version of Hot Gossip included:

*males: Mark Tyme, Roy Gale, Floyd Pearce
*females: Dominique Wood, Donna Fielding, Carol Fletcher, Perri Lister, Lyndsey Ward, Sarah Brightman, Lorraine Whitmarsh

Everett moved to the BBC for &quot;The Kenny Everett Television Show&quot; (1981–1988), which featured Hot Gossip only in Season 4 (1986).

===Recordings===
In 1978, during their initial impact period on &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot;, Hot Gossip, featuring Sarah Brightman on lead vocals, recorded &quot;I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper&quot;, a disco song written by Jeff Calvert and Geraint Hughes. The song reached number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1981, the group recorded a cover version of Suzanne Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Love on the Phone&quot;, and the same year released the synth-pop album &quot;Geisha Boys and Temple Girls&quot;, produced by former Human League and then current Heaven 17/BEF member Martyn Ware.

===&quot;The Very Hot Gossip Show&quot;===
Produced by Burton and Telecast for Channel 4 in 1982, this one-hour special was one of the highest rated shows for Channel 4 that year.

=== Film appearance ===
The group appeared in the film &quot;The Golden Lady&quot; (1979). Members of the group appear in several scenes performing dance sequences in the Pet Shop Boys 1987 Jack Bond directed feature film It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here.

==Style==
Hot Gossip were noted for the risqué nature of their costumes and dance routines, designed and choreographed by Phillips, especially considering the early evening timeslot for &quot;The Kenny Everett&quot; &quot;Video Show&quot;. The male dancers were handsome and black and the female members were attractive and white.

== Sponooch ==
In late 1979 Mark Tyme, Dom Wood, Lorraine Whitmarsh, Carol Fletcher, Lyndsey Ward, Donna Fielding and Lee Black left Hot Gossip to form Sponooch, which was featured in the BBC TV shows &quot;Friday Night Saturday Morning&quot; (1979) and &quot;Dancing Girls&quot; (6 January 1982). They signed to EMI and released two singles, &quot;Crime Buster&quot; and &quot;Lady Dracula&quot;.

<text>The red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator) is a duck species that is native to much of the Northern Hemisphere. The red breast that gives the species its common name is only displayed by males in breeding plumage. Individuals fly rapidly, and feed by diving from the surface to pursue aquatic animals underwater, using serrated bills to capture slippery fish. They migrate each year from breeding sites on lakes and rivers to their mostly coastal wintering areas, making them the only species in the genus &quot;Mergus&quot; to frequent saltwater. They form flocks outside of breeding season that are usually small but can reach 100 individuals. The worldwide population of this species is stable, though it is threatened in some areas by habitat loss and other factors.

==Taxonomy==
The red-breasted merganser was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Mergus serrator&quot;. The genus name &quot;Mergus&quot; is a Latin word used by Pliny and other Roman authors to refer to an unspecified water bird. The specific epithet &quot;serrator&quot; is Latin for sawyer and is ultimately from &quot;serra&quot;, meaning saw. It refers to the saw-like projections on the bird&#x27;s bill, which enable it to hold on to slippery fish, its most frequent prey. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The adult red-breasted merganser is long, has a wingspan of , and weighs 

It has a spiky crest and long thin red bill with serrated edges. The male has a dark head with a green sheen, a white neck with a rusty breast, a black back, and white underparts. Adult females have a rusty head and a grayish body. Juveniles look similar to females, but lack the white collar and have smaller white wing patches.

The range of the red-breasted merganser broadly overlaps with that of the similar and closely related common merganser. The two species can therefore occur in the same place at the same time, though the species often choose different habitats (only the red-breasted frequents saltwater). Breeding male plumages are fairly distinctive, but other plumages such as those born by females, immatures, and non-breeding males can make the two species hard to distinguish. The common merganser displays more contrast between the darker head and lighter breast and has a light chin patch not seen on the red-breasted.

===Voice===
During courtship, the female gives a rasping &quot;prrak prrak&quot;, while the male gives a catlike &quot;meow&quot;. In flight, the female makes a harsh &quot;gruk&quot;. At other times this species is largely silent.

==Behaviour==

===Food and feeding===
Red-breasted mergansers dive and swim underwater. They mainly eat small fish, but also consume aquatic insects, worms, crustaceans, and amphibians.

===Breeding===
Its breeding habitat is freshwater lakes and rivers across northern North America, Greenland, Europe, and the Palearctic. It nests in sheltered locations on the ground near water. It is migratory and many northern breeders winter in coastal waters further south. Outside of the breeding season, it forms flocks that can reach 100 individuals, though these flocks are smaller during spring migration than they are in autumn migration and in winter. 
===Speed record===
The fastest duck ever recorded was a red-breasted merganser that attained a top airspeed of while being pursued by an airplane. This eclipsed the previous speed record held by a canvasback clocked at .

==Conservation==
The red-breasted merganser is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. The species is also considered a game bird under the Migratory Bird Treaty between the United States and Canada. This means that the species gets some protection, though hunting it is legal in North America in certain seasons and places determined by local hunting regulations. However, few hunters are interested in the species and relatively few birds are harvested.

The species is widespread and common enough to be categorized as least concern by the IUCN, though populations in some areas may be declining. Threats include habitat loss through wetland destruction, exposure to toxins such as pesticides and lead, and becoming bycatch of commercial fishing operations. Anglers and fish farmers have also persecuted the species, which they regard as a competitor, though the impact of this on the species&#x27; population is not known.

<text>Liveaboard can mean: 

*Someone who makes a boat, typically a small yacht in a marina, their primary residence. Powerboats and cruising sailboats are commonly used for living aboard, as well as houseboats which are designed primarily as a residence. 
*A boat designed for people to live aboard it. 
*A boat used for recreational diving expeditions or cruises where the divers live on the boat for the duration of the cruise and use it as a diving support vessel.

The liveaboard lifestyle has attractions and downsides. Most boats are much smaller than equivalent cost shoreside residences, they are more exposed to bad weather, and require special maintenance skills. However, they are mobile, provide water access, and allow for integrated recreational, transportation, and housing costs. Where the cost of housing is high, a liveaboard lifestyle may have cost advantages. Although it is sometimes regarded as being a cheaper way to live this is not always the case. Liveaboard boats can be luxury vessels moored in expensive marinas or small vessels in need of restoration. One attraction of the lifestyle is there is something to suit everyone. Because of this, liveaboards are very diverse people coming from many different backgrounds.

==Scuba diving liveaboards==
In the recreational scuba diving industry, a liveaboard service offers its guests the opportunity to stay aboard for one or more nights, unlike a day boat operation. This allows time to travel to more distant dive sites. Normally, a liveaboard charter caters for between about ten and thirty passengers.

While most liveaboards around the world are usually made with fiber reinforced plastic or steel hulls, in Indonesia, traditional pinisi boats made from teak wood are commonly used.

<doc id="258827" wikidata="Q900639" url="?curid=258827" title="Dynamic mechanical analysis">
<text>Dynamic mechanical analysis (abbreviated DMA) is a technique used to study and characterize materials. It is most useful for studying the viscoelastic behavior of polymers. A sinusoidal stress is applied and the strain in the material is measured, allowing one to determine the complex modulus. The temperature of the sample or the frequency of the stress are often varied, leading to variations in the complex modulus; this approach can be used to locate the glass transition temperature of the material, as well as to identify transitions corresponding to other molecular motions.

==Theory==

===Viscoelastic properties of materials===

Polymers composed of long molecular chains have unique viscoelastic properties, which combine the characteristics of elastic solids and Newtonian fluids. The classical theory of elasticity describes the mechanical properties of elastic solids where stress is proportional to strain in small deformations. Such response to stress is independent of strain rate. The classical theory of hydrodynamics describes the properties of viscous fluid, for which stress response depends on strain rate. This solidlike and liquidlike behaviour of polymers can be modelled mechanically with combinations of springs and dashpots, making for both elastic and viscous behaviour of viscoelastic materials such as bitumen.

===Dynamic moduli of polymers===
The viscoelastic property of a polymer is studied by dynamic mechanical analysis where a sinusoidal force (stress σ) is applied to a material and the resulting displacement (strain) is measured. For a perfectly elastic solid, the resulting strain and the stress will be perfectly in phase. For a purely viscous fluid, there will be a 90 degree phase lag of strain with respect to stress. Viscoelastic polymers have the characteristics in between where some phase lag will occur during DMA tests. When the strain is applied and the stress lags behind, the following equations hold:

*Stress: formula_1
*Strain: formula_2

where
:formula_3 is the frequency of strain oscillation,
:formula_4 is time,
:formula_5 is phase lag between stress and strain.

Consider the purely elastic case, where stress is proportional to strain given by Young&#x27;s modulus formula_6 . We have &lt;br&gt;
formula_7

Now for the purely viscous case, where stress is proportional to strain &quot;rate&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
formula_8

The storage modulus measures the stored energy, representing the elastic portion, and the loss modulus measures the energy dissipated as heat, representing the viscous portion. The tensile storage and loss moduli are defined as follows:

*Storage modulus: formula_9
*Loss modulus: formula_10
*Phase angle: formula_11

Similarly, in the shearing instead of tension case, we also define shear storage and loss moduli, formula_12 and formula_13.

Complex variables can be used to express the moduli formula_14 and formula_15 as follows:
:formula_16
:formula_17
where
:formula_18

====Derivation of dynamic moduli====

Shear stress formula_19 of a finite element in one direction can be expressed with relaxation modulus formula_20 and strain rate, integrated over all past times formula_21 up to the current time formula_4. With strain rate formula_23and substitution formula_24 one obtains formula_25. Application of the trigonometric addition theorem formula_26 lead to the expression 
:formula_27 
with converging integrals, if formula_28 for formula_29, which depend on frequency but not of time. Extension of formula_30 with trigonometric identity formula_31 lead to 
:formula_32. 
Comparison of the two formula_33 equations lead to the definition of formula_12 and formula_13.

==Applications==

===Measuring glass transition temperature===
One important application of DMA is measurement of the glass transition temperature of polymers. Amorphous polymers have different glass transition temperatures, above which the material will have rubbery properties instead of glassy behavior and the stiffness of the material will drop dramatically along with a reduction in its viscosity. At the glass transition, the storage modulus decreases dramatically and the loss modulus reaches a maximum. Temperature-sweeping DMA is often used to characterize the glass transition temperature of a material.
===Polymer composition===

Varying the composition of monomers and cross-linking can add or change the functionality of a polymer that can alter the results obtained from DMA. An example of such changes can be seen by blending ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) with styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and different cross-linking or curing systems. Nair &quot;et al.&quot; abbreviate blends as E0S, E20S, etc., where E0S equals the weight percent of EPDM in the blend and S denotes sulfur as the curing agent.

Increasing the amount of SBR in the blend decreased the storage modulus due to intermolecular and intramolecular interactions that can alter the physical state of the polymer. Within the glassy region, EPDM shows the highest storage modulus due to stronger intermolecular interactions (SBR has more steric hindrance that makes it less crystalline). In the rubbery region, SBR shows the highest storage modulus resulting from its ability to resist intermolecular slippage.

When compared to sulfur, the higher storage modulus occurred for blends cured with dicumyl peroxide (DCP) because of the relative strengths of C-C and C-S bonds.

Incorporation of reinforcing fillers into the polymer blends also increases the storage modulus at an expense of limiting the loss tangent peak height.

DMA can also be used to effectively evaluate the miscibility of polymers. The E40S blend had a much broader transition with a shoulder instead of a steep drop-off in a storage modulus plot of varying blend ratios, indicating that there are areas that are not homogeneous.

==Instrumentation==
The instrumentation of a DMA consists of a displacement sensor such as a linear variable differential transformer, which measures a change in voltage as a result of the instrument probe moving through a magnetic core, a temperature control system or furnace, a drive motor (a linear motor for probe loading which provides load for the applied force), a drive shaft support and guidance system to act as a guide for the force from the motor to the sample, and sample clamps in order to hold the sample being tested. Depending on what is being measured, samples will be prepared and handled differently. A general schematic of the primary components of a DMA instrument is shown in figure 3.

===Types of analyzers===
There are two main types of DMA analyzers used currently: forced resonance analyzers and free resonance analyzers. Free resonance analyzers measure the free oscillations of damping of the sample being tested by suspending and swinging the sample. A restriction to free resonance analyzers is that it is limited to rod or rectangular shaped samples, but samples that can be woven/braided are also applicable. Forced resonance analyzers are the more common type of analyzers available in instrumentation today. These types of analyzers force the sample to oscillate at a certain frequency and are reliable for performing a temperature sweep.

Analyzers are made for both stress (force) and strain (displacement) control. In strain control, the probe is displaced and the resulting stress of the sample is measured by implementing a force balance transducer, which utilizes different shafts. The advantages of strain control include a better short time response for materials of low viscosity and experiments of stress relaxation are done with relative ease. In stress control, a set force is applied to the sample and several other experimental conditions (temperature, frequency, or time) can be varied. Stress control is typically less expensive than strain control because only one shaft is needed, but this also makes it harder to use. Some advantages of stress control include the fact that the structure of the sample is less likely to be destroyed and longer relaxation times/ longer creep studies can be done with much more ease. Characterizing low viscous materials come at a disadvantage of short time responses that are limited by inertia. Stress and strain control analyzers give about the same results as long as characterization is within the linear region of the polymer in question. However, stress control lends a more realistic response because polymers have a tendency to resist a load.

Stress and strain can be applied via torsional or axial analyzers. Torsional analyzers are mainly used for liquids or melts but can also be implemented for some solid samples since the force is applied in a twisting motion. The instrument can do creep-recovery, stress–relaxation, and stress–strain experiments. Axial analyzers are used for solid or semisolid materials. It can do flexure, tensile, and compression testing (even shear and liquid specimens if desired). These analyzers can test higher modulus materials than torsional analyzers. The instrument can do thermomechanical analysis (TMA) studies in addition to the experiments that torsional analyzers can do. Figure 4 shows the general difference between the two applications of stress and strain.

Changing sample geometry and fixtures can make stress and strain analyzers virtually indifferent of one another except at the extreme ends of sample phases, i.e. really fluid or rigid materials. Common geometries and fixtures for axial analyzers include three-point and four-point bending, dual and single cantilever, parallel plate and variants, bulk, extension/tensile, and shear plates and sandwiches. Geometries and fixtures for torsional analyzers consist of parallel plates, cone-and-plate, couette, and torsional beam and braid. In order to utilize DMA to characterize materials, the fact that small dimensional changes can also lead to large inaccuracies in certain tests needs to be addressed. Inertia and shear heating can affect the results of either forced or free resonance analyzers, especially in fluid samples.

===Test modes===
Two major kinds of test modes can be used to probe the viscoelastic properties of polymers: temperature sweep and frequency sweep tests. A third, less commonly studied test mode is dynamic stress–strain testing.

====Temperature sweep====
A common test method involves measuring the complex modulus at low constant frequency while varying the sample temperature. A prominent peak in formula_36 appears at the glass transition temperature of the polymer. Secondary transitions can also be observed, which can be attributed to the temperature-dependent activation of a wide variety of chain motions. In semi-crystalline polymers, separate transitions can be observed for the crystalline and amorphous sections. Similarly, multiple transitions are often found in polymer blends.

For instance, blends of polycarbonate and poly(acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) were studied with the intention of developing a polycarbonate-based material without polycarbonate&#x27;s tendency towards brittle failure. Temperature-sweeping DMA of the blends showed two strong transitions coincident with the glass transition temperatures of PC and PABS, consistent with the finding that the two polymers were immiscible.

====Frequency sweep====
A sample can be held to a fixed temperature and can be tested at varying frequency. Peaks in formula_36 and in E’’ with respect to frequency can be associated with the glass transition, which corresponds to the ability of chains to move past each other. This implies that the glass transition is dependent on strain rate in addition to temperature. Secondary transitions may be observed as well.

The Maxwell model provides a convenient, if not strictly accurate, description of viscoelastic materials. Applying a sinusoidal stress to a Maxwell model gives: formula_38 where formula_39 is the Maxwell relaxation time. Thus, a peak in E’’ is observed at the frequency formula_40. A real polymer may have several different relaxation times associated with different molecular motions.

====Dynamic stress–strain studies====

By gradually increasing the amplitude of oscillations, one can perform a dynamic stress–strain measurement. The variation of storage and loss moduli with increasing stress can be used for materials characterization, and to determine the upper bound of the material&#x27;s linear stress–strain regime.

====Combined sweep====
Because glass transitions and secondary transitions are seen in both frequency studies and temperature studies, there is interest in multidimensional studies, where temperature sweeps are conducted at a variety of frequencies or frequency sweeps are conducted at a variety of temperatures. This sort of study provides a rich characterization of the material, and can lend information about the nature of the molecular motion responsible for the transition.

For instance, studies of polystyrene (Tg ≈110 °C) have noted a secondary transition near room temperature. Temperature-frequency studies showed that the transition temperature is largely frequency-independent, suggesting that this transition results from a motion of a small number of atoms; it has been suggested that this is the result of the rotation of the phenyl group around the main chain.

<text>Marc Maria Frans, Viscount Eyskens (born 29 April 1933), known as Mark Eyskens, is a Belgian economist, professor and politician in the Christian People&#x27;s Party, now called Christian Democratic and Flemish, and briefly served as the prime minister of Belgium in 1981.

==Early life==
Eyskens was born in Leuven, the son of Gaston Eyskens, and lived for a time at the International House of New York. When Germany invaded Belgium, Eyskens and his mother fled to France but upon the Belgian capitulation, the family returned to Leuven.

==Academic career==
In 1953, Eyskens attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy. In 1956, he became a doctor juris at the University of Leuven. In 1957, he obtained a master of arts in economics at Columbia University. In 1962, he received a doctorate in economic sciences. In 1962, he became a professor at the University of Leuven (1962–1998). From 1971 to 1976, he was chairman of the university. He was a member of the Club of Rome (1972–1978). In 2004, he was chairman of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts.

==Political career==
In 1962, Eyskens started his political career as a counsellor in the cabinet of the Minister of Finance André Dequae.

In 1976, Eyskens became Secretary of State for Town and Country Planning and Housing (1976–1977, Tindemans I). Eyskens was first elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 1977. He was re-elected (elections of 1977, 1981, 1985, 1987, 1991, 1978, 1995, 1999) and served until 2003.

He became Secretary of State for the budget and Flemish affairs (1977–1979, Tindemans II &amp; Vanden Boeynants II), Minister of Development Aid (1979–1980, Martens I, Martens II &amp; Martens III) and Minister of Finance (1980–1981, Martens IV). Eyskens became the 45th Prime Minister of Belgium on 6 April 1981, an office his father had held six times. His government quickly collapsed on 17 December, due to disagreements on the financing of the Walloon steel industry. After the fall of his government he served as Minister for Economical Affairs (1981–1985, Martens V) and Minister of Finance (1985–1988, Martens VI &amp; Martens VII). Although originally not a member of the Martens VIII cabinet, on 19 June 1989 he re-entered the government when he replaced Leo Tindemans as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1989–1992, Martens VIII &amp; Martens IX). This was the last government office he held. He served as a backbencher 1992–2003 and retired at the 2003 general election.

==Later career==
On 18 November 1998, Eyskens was made a Minister of State. In the 2006 provincial elections Eyskens was elected to the provincial council of Flemish Brabant. He served from 2007 until his resignation in 2009.

Eyskens is a member of the Advisory Board of the Global Panel Foundation, a member of the Advisory Board of the Itinera Institute think-tank and as Honorary President of the Olivaint Conference of Belgium.

<text>Doofus is an American alternative comic book character created by Rick Altergott. In the low-brow, scatological strip, Doofus and his sidekick/pal Henry Hotchkiss are two foolish creeps who have adventures in the fictional Flowertown, USA. Fantagraphics Books published two issues of the series from 1994 to 1997.

== Characterization ==
Doofus is a short, obese grown man with facial stubble and a pageboy haircut, topped by a straw boater. He is a known liar and obnoxious human being, with an affinity for sniffing women&#x27;s underwear.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Doofus&quot; strips first appeared in the alternative weekly &quot;The Stranger&quot;. &quot;Doofus&quot;&#x27;s comic book debut was in &quot;Eightball&quot; #8 (Fantagraphics, May 1992). From 1995 to 1998, &quot;Doofus&quot; strips appeared as a backup feature in Peter Bagge&#x27;s &quot;Hate&quot;, issues #21–26, and #29–30. The character also appeared in various publications, including &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, and other comic books published by Fantagraphics, including &quot;Raisin Pie&quot;.

In 2014, Altergott produced a weekly &quot;Doofus&quot;-related comic for &quot;Vice&quot; titled &quot;Flowertown USA.&quot;

<text>Thermal analysis is a branch of materials science where the properties of materials are studied as they change with temperature. Several methods are commonly used – these are distinguished from one another by the property which is measured:

* Dielectric thermal analysis: dielectric permittivity and loss factor 
* Differential thermal analysis: temperature difference versus temperature or time
* Differential scanning calorimetry: heat flow changes versus temperature or time
* Dilatometry: volume changes with temperature change
* Dynamic mechanical analysis: measures storage modulus (stiffness) and loss modulus (damping) versus temperature, time and frequency 
* Evolved gas analysis: analysis of gases evolved during heating of a material, usually decomposition products
* Isothermal titration calorimetry
* Isothermal microcalorimetry
* Laser flash analysis: thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity
* Thermogravimetric analysis: mass change versus temperature or time
* Thermomechanical analysis: dimensional changes versus temperature or time
* Thermo-optical analysis: optical properties
* Derivatography: A complex method in thermal analysis
Simultaneous thermal analysis generally refers to the simultaneous application of thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry to one and the same sample in a single instrument. The test conditions are perfectly identical for the thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry signals (same atmosphere, gas flow rate, vapor pressure of the sample, heating rate, thermal contact to the sample crucible and sensor, radiation effect, etc.). The information gathered can even be enhanced by coupling the simultaneous thermal analysis instrument to an Evolved Gas Analyzer like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or mass spectrometry.

Other, less common, methods measure the sound or light emission from a sample, or the electrical discharge from a dielectric material, or the mechanical relaxation in a stressed specimen. The essence of all these techniques is that the sample&#x27;s response is recorded as a function of temperature (and time).

It is usual to control the temperature in a predetermined way – either by a continuous increase or decrease in temperature at a constant rate (linear heating/cooling) or by carrying out a series of determinations at different temperatures (stepwise isothermal measurements). More advanced temperature profiles have been developed which use an oscillating (usually sine or square wave) heating rate (Modulated Temperature Thermal Analysis) or modify the heating rate in response to changes in the system&#x27;s properties (Sample Controlled Thermal Analysis).

In addition to controlling the temperature of the sample, it is also important to control its environment (e.g. atmosphere). Measurements may be carried out in air or under an inert gas (e.g. nitrogen or helium). Reducing or reactive atmospheres have also been used and measurements are even carried out with the sample surrounded by water or other liquids. Inverse gas chromatography is a technique which studies the interaction of gases and vapours with a surface - measurements are often made at different temperatures so that these experiments can be considered to come under the auspices of Thermal Analysis.

Atomic force microscopy uses a fine stylus to map the topography and mechanical properties of surfaces to high spatial resolution. By controlling the temperature of the heated tip and/or the sample a form of spatially resolved thermal analysis can be carried out.

&quot;Thermal analysis&quot; is also often used as a term for the study of heat transfer through structures. Many of the basic engineering data for modelling such systems comes from measurements of heat capacity and thermal conductivity.

==Polymers==

Polymers represent another large area in which thermal analysis finds strong applications. Thermoplastic polymers are commonly found in everyday packaging and household items, but for the analysis of the raw materials, effects of the many additive used (including stabilisers and colours) and fine-tuning of the moulding or extrusion processing used can be achieved by using differential scanning calorimetry. An example is oxidation induction time by differential scanning calorimetry which can determine the amount of oxidation stabiliser present in a thermoplastic (usually a polyolefin) polymer material. Compositional analysis is often made using thermogravimetric analysis, which can separate fillers, polymer resin and other additives. Thermogravimetric analysis can also give an indication of thermal stability and the effects of additives such as flame retardants. (See &quot;J.H.Flynn, L.A.Wall J.Res.Nat.Bur. Standerds, General Treatment of the Thermogravimetry of Polymers Part A, 1966 V70A, No5 487)&quot;

Thermal analysis of composite materials, such as carbon fibre composites or glass epoxy composites are often carried out using dynamic mechanical analysis, which can measure the stiffness of materials by determining the modulus and damping (energy absorbing) properties of the material. Aerospace companies often employ these analysers in routine quality control to ensure that products being manufactured meet the required strength specifications. Formula 1 racing car manufacturers also have similar requirements. Differential scanning calorimetry is used to determine the curing properties of the resins used in composite materials, and can also confirm whether a resin can be cured and how much heat is evolved during that process. Application of predictive kinetics analysis can help to fine-tune manufacturing processes. Another example is that thermogravimetric analysis can be used to measure the fibre content of composites by heating a sample to remove the resin by application of heat and then determining the mass remaining.

==Metals==
Production of many metals (cast iron, grey iron, ductile iron, compacted graphite iron, 3000 series aluminium alloys, copper alloys, silver, and complex steels) are aided by a production technique also referred to as thermal analysis. A sample of liquid metal is removed from the furnace or ladle and poured into a sample cup with a thermocouple embedded in it. The temperature is then monitored, and the phase diagram arrests (liquidus, eutectic, and solidus) are noted. From this information chemical composition based on the phase diagram can be calculated, or the crystalline structure of the cast sample can be estimated especially for silicon morphology in hypo-eutectic Al-Si cast alloys. Strictly speaking these measurements are &quot;cooling curves&quot; and a form of sample controlled thermal analysis whereby the cooling rate of the sample is dependent on the cup material (usually bonded sand) and sample volume which is normally a constant due to the use of standard sized sample cups. To detect phase evolution and corresponding characteristic temperatures, cooling curve and its first derivative curve should be considered simultaneously. Examination of cooling and derivative curves is done by using appropriate data analysis software. The process consists of plotting, smoothing and curve fitting as well as identifying the reaction points and characteristic parameters. This procedure is known as Computer-Aided Cooling Curve Thermal Analysis.

Advanced techniques use differential curves to locate endothermic inflection points such as gas holes, and shrinkage, or exothermic phases such as carbides, beta crystals, inter crystalline copper, magnesium silicide, iron phosphide&#x27;s and other phases as they solidify. Detection limits seem to be around 0.01% to 0.03% of volume.

In addition, integration of the area between the zero curve and the first derivative is a measure of the specific heat of that part of the solidification which can lead to rough estimates of the percent volume of a phase. (Something has to be either known or assumed about the specific heat of the phase versus the overall specific heat.) In spite of this limitation, this method is better than estimates from two dimensional micro analysis, and a lot faster than chemical dissolution.

==Foods==

Most foods are subjected to variations in their temperature during production, transport, storage, preparation and consumption, e.g., pasteurization, sterilization, evaporation, cooking, freezing, chilling, etc. Temperature changes cause alterations in the physical and chemical properties of food components which influence the overall properties of the final product, e.g., taste, appearance, texture and stability. Chemical reactions such as hydrolysis, oxidation or reduction may be promoted, or physical changes, such as evaporation, melting, crystallization, aggregation or gelation may occur. A better understanding of the influence of temperature on the properties of foods enables food manufacturers to optimize processing conditions and improve product quality. It is therefore important for food scientists to have analytical techniques to monitor the changes that occur in foods when their temperature varies. These techniques are often grouped under the general heading of thermal analysis. In principle, most analytical techniques can be used, or easily adapted, to monitor the temperature-dependent properties of foods, e.g., spectroscopic (nuclear magnetic resonance, UV-visible, infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence), scattering (light, X-rays, neutrons), physical (mass, density, rheology, heat capacity) etc. Nevertheless, at present the term thermal analysis is usually reserved for a narrow range of techniques that measure changes in the physical properties of foods with temperature (TG/DTG, differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and transition temperature).

==Printed circuit boards==

Power dissipation is an important issue in present-day PCB design. Power dissipation will result in temperature difference and pose a thermal problem to a chip. In addition to the issue of reliability, excess heat will also negatively affect electrical performance and safety. The working temperature of an IC should therefore be kept below the maximum allowable limit of the worst case. In general, the temperatures of junction and ambient are 125 °C and 55 °C, respectively.
The ever-shrinking chip size causes the heat to concentrate within a small area and leads to high power density. Furthermore, denser transistors gathering in a monolithic chip and higher operating frequency cause a worsening of the power dissipation. Removing the heat effectively becomes the critical issue to be resolved.

<text>Pedicide, also known as child murder, child manslaughter or child homicide, is the homicide of an individual who is a minor. In many legal jurisdictions, it is considered an aggravated form of homicide. The age of the victim may constitute an aggravated factor for homicide offenses, or child murder may be a stand-alone criminal offense.

== Punishment by jurisdiction ==
===United States===
In 2008, there were 1,494 pedicides in the United States. Of those killed, 1,035 were male and 452 were female.

About half of the states that maintain the death penalty have included pedicide to their list of aggravating factors that may make a murder punishable by death. The victim&#x27;s age under which the crime is a capital crime varies between states. The ages are set between 10 and 17, with 12 being the most common age.

Child manslaughter can result in an aggravated charge in some jurisdictions such as in the State of Florida.

===United Kingdom===
Any murder in the United Kingdom carries a mandatory life sentence. In England and Wales, pedicides involving sexual or sadistic conduct or abduction of the victim can result in a whole life order (i.e. life imprisonment without the possibility of parole) being imposed where the offender is at least 21 years of age. Sentencing guidelines state that where the offender is under 21, the starting point is a minimum term of 30 years.

==By other children==

In most countries, there are very few cases where children are killed by other children. According to the U.S. Department of Justice statistics for 1996, one in five pedicides were committed by other children. Several pedicides have gained prominent media exposure. One was the killing on 12 February 1993 of the 2-year-old boy James Bulger by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables who were both 10-years-old in Bootle, Merseyside, England. He was beaten and stoned before his corpse was left on train tracks in order to give the impression that a train had hit him. Bulger&#x27;s killers became the youngest convicted murderers in the modern history of the United Kingdom. Another notable case in the UK occurred in 1968 in Newcastle upon Tyne, when 10-year-old Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility in the deaths of toddlers Martin Brown and Brian Howe. She was released in 1980 at the age of 23. In 1998, 8-year-old Madelyn Clifton was killed by 14-year-old Josh Phillips.

==By medical professionals==
Children, especially infants, have been killed on purpose by medical professionals. Katherine Ramsland, an expert in serial killers, believes predatory offenders may view healthcare agencies as &quot;places of trust&quot; where they have advantages. While other killers may decide to reduce the workload, or set someone up out of spite, or get God complex and think they are helping their victims, or be seeking attention, self-empowerment, and thrill. In one such case, neonatal nurse Lucy Letby was accused of killing at least 7 infants between June 2015 and 2016 at the Countess of Chester Hospital and attempting to kill a further 10 more.

==Media coverage==

In 1992, after the fatal shooting of 7-year-old Dantrell Davis as he left the Cabrini–Green public housing project for school, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; put every pedicide on the front page. 62 pedicides were reported that year.

Multiple deaths in one incident, such as the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the 1996 Dunblane massacre tend to gather the most media attention but are statistically scarce.

==Genocide and child soldiers==

The military use of children refers to children being placed in harm&#x27;s way in military actions, in order to protect a location or provide propaganda. This is sometimes referred to as child sacrifice, though not equivalent to the religious variety. It may also refer to the use of children as child soldiers or saboteurs.

Red Hand Day on February 12 is an annual commemoration day to draw public attention to the practice of using children as soldiers in wars and armed conflicts.

==&quot;Muti killings&quot;==
Medicine murder, often referred to as &quot;muti killing&quot;, is a practice of human sacrifice and mutilation associated with traditional medicinal practices, such as Muti. Victims of muti killings are often children. Organs and/or body parts are usually taken while the child is still alive. An unknown child (referred to as &quot;Adam&quot;), whose decapitated torso was found in the River Thames in London in 2002 is believed to have been the victim of a muti killing.

<text>Davao Gulf is a gulf situated in the southeastern portion of Mindanao in the Philippines. It has an area of or about 520,000 hectares. Davao Gulf cuts into the island of Mindanao from the Philippine Sea. It is surrounded by all five provinces in the Davao Region. The largest island in the gulf is Samal Island. Davao City, on the Gulf&#x27;s west coast, is the largest and busiest port on the gulf. The Bagobo and the Kaagan / Kalagan, who are the indigenous Lumad tribes endemic to Davao, are known inhabitants of the said gulf.

==Wildlife==
The gulf water is regarded as one of the most diverse cetacean habitats in the nation, being home to at least 10 species of toothed whales and dolphins such as sperm whales and beaked whales. Also, whale sharks and sea cows are seen frequently. Furthermore, several ecological phenomena have been observed in Davao Gulf such as a previously unknown predator of the crown-of-thorns starfish, new species records, and new species discoveries underlining the uniqueness of the marine resources in Davao Gulf.

<doc id="258839" wikidata="Q837834" url="?curid=258839" title="Capsule hotel">
<text>A capsule hotel (), also known in the Western world as a pod hotel, is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features many small, bed-sized rooms known as capsules. Capsule hotels provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require or who cannot afford larger, more expensive rooms offered by more conventional hotels.

The first capsule hotel in the world opened in 1979 and was the Capsule Inn Osaka, located in the Umeda district of Osaka, Japan and designed by Kisho Kurokawa. From there, it spread to other cities within Japan. Since then, the concept has further spread to various other territories, including Belgium, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea.

==Description==
The guest room is a chamber roughly the length and width of a single bed, with sufficient height for a hotel guest to crawl in and sit up on the bed. The chamber walls may be made of wood, metal or any rigid material, but are often fibreglass or plastic. Amenities within the room generally include a small television, air conditioning, an electronic console, and power sockets. The capsules are stacked side-by-side, two units high, with steps or ladders providing access to the second-level rooms, similar to bunk beds. The open end of the capsule can be closed with a curtain or a solid door for privacy, but can be locked from the inside only.

Like a hostel, many amenities are communally shared, including toilets, showers, wireless internet, and dining rooms. In Japan, a capsule hotel may have a communal bath and sauna. Some hotels also provide restaurants, snack bars, bars, or vending machines, pools, and other entertainment facilities. There may be a lounge with upholstered chairs for relaxing, along with newspapers and reading material.

Capsule hotels vary in size, from 50 or so capsules to 700, and primarily cater to men. Some capsule hotels offer separate sections for male and female guests, or even separate floors and elevators. Clothes and shoes are exchanged for a &quot;yukata&quot; and slippers on entry, and a towel and bathrobe may also be provided. Luggage and valuables are usually stored in lockers or—if available—in-room safes. Guests are asked not to smoke or eat in the capsules.

== Customer base ==
The benefits of these hotels are their convenience and low price, usually around ¥2000–4000 (USD –) a night.

In Japan, capsule hotels have been stereotypically used by Japanese salarymen who may be too drunk to return home safely, have missed the last train of the day to make a return trip home due to working late hours, or are too embarrassed to face their spouses. During the Great Recession, some unemployed or underemployed workers who had become homeless during the crisis temporarily rented capsules by the month. As of 2010, these customers made up 30% of visitors at the Capsule Hotel Shinjuku 510 in Tokyo.

<doc id="258843" wikidata="Q13682" url="?curid=258843" title="Zamboanga Peninsula">
<text>Zamboanga Peninsula (; ; ) is an administrative region in Mindanao, Philippines, designated as Region IX. It consists of the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Sur, and the cities of Isabela and Zamboanga City. The region was previously known as Western Mindanao. Pagadian serves as the regional center, while Zamboanga City is the commercial and industrial center.

== History ==

=== Ancient era ===
During the ancient era, the Zamboanga peninsula was a vast territory home to various ethnic groups – the largest of which was the Subanen people. Later on, the southern coastal areas of the region were under the influence of the Javanese Majapahit Empire, although the empire never did conquer the area.
=== Sultanate of Maguindanao era ===
In the 14th century, the Sultanate of Sulu ruled the southwestern sections of the peninsula. By the late 15th century and early 16th century, Malay missionaries further spread Islam in the southern Philippines. Sharif Kabungsuwan, a Johore-born missionary of Malay and Arab descent established the Sultanate of Maguindanao, which the entire island of Mindanao is named after. The sultanate also occupied the entire island except present-day Caraga region, stretching from the Zamboanga Peninsula to Davao Oriental, while the Sultanate of Sulu lost its territories in Zamboanga. Maguindanao&#x27;s sultans provided Mindanao fierce armed resistance against the Spanish occupation, especially under the lead of Muhammad Kudarat. They soon allied themselves with the Sulu sultanate. The Muslim natives of the region were collectively known as Moros by the Spanish, meaning &quot;Moor&quot;, though the Iberian Moors and the Philippine Muslims had little cultural connection outside of following Islam. A large chunk of the Spanish–Moro conflict, the war between the Spanish and Mindanao&#x27;s Muslim natives took place in the Zamboanga Peninsula.

=== Spanish rule ===
In 1569 Zamboanga was chosen as the site of the Spanish settlement and garrison on La Caldera (now called Barrio Recodo). Zamboanga was one of the main strongholds in Mindanao, supporting colonizing efforts in the south of the island and making way for Christian settlements. It also served as a military outpost, protecting the island against foreign invaders and Moro pirates and their Chinese allies. The province, named and centered on Zamboanga City was partly founded by Peruvian soldiers brought by Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera.

The Zamboanga Peninsula played a central role in the Spanish–Moro conflict. It was the site of constant battling between Spanish soldiers and Moro pirate raids. While the Spanish successfully established churches in the region, they suffered heavily at the hands of Moro raiders, and had to repeatedly withdraw from the region. While the Spanish achieved a tactical victory by launching several attacks against the Sultanate of Sulu, constant fighting and attacks persisted, giving the Moros a psychological victory.

=== Province of Zamboanga ===
After the United States annexed the Spanish East Indies in 1898, the peninsula hosted a briefly independent state called the Republic of Zamboanga. It was incorporated by the Insular Government into the Moro Province, which consisted of the central and western parts of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. The name and status of Moro Province were changed to the Department of Mindanao and Sulu on August 16, 1916, causing Zamboanga to become a separate province.

In 1942, the Zamboanga Peninsula along with the rest of the Philippine Islands was occupied by the Empire of Japan at the beginning of the Second World War. The Peninsula was liberated in 1945 by joint American and Philippine Commonwealth forces fighting against the Imperial Japanese Army.

On June 6, 1952, the province was partitioned into Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur, while the chartered city of Zamboanga became part of Zamboanga del Sur.

=== Region ===
Together with the Sulu Archipelago, the provinces that formerly made up Zamboanga Province were re-organised into Region IX by order of Presidential Decree No. 1 as part of the Integrated Reorganization Plan of President Ferdinand Marcos, that was signed on September 24, 1972.

From 1975 to 1989, the old Region IX (Western Mindanao) was further divided into two sub-regions by Presidential Decree No. 8233 dated August 21, 1975. Sub-Region IX-A consisted of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi with Jolo, Sulu, as the sub-regional center, while Sub-Region IX-B consisted of the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga Sibugay, with the chartered city of Zamboanga City as the sub-regional centre.

=== Present ===
In 2001, Zamboanga Sibugay, was created from the province of Zamboanga del Sur with Ipil as the seat of government with the virtue of Republic Act No. 8973.

In the same year, the residents of Basilan opted to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in a plebiscite. However, the citizens of the capital, Isabela, did not want to join so the city remained a part of this region as a result of Executive Order No. 36 last until 2014 only.

=== Regional center issue ===
In 1978, Presidential Decree No. 1555 transferred Region IX&#x27;s regional center from Jolo, Sulu to Zamboanga City.

Executive Order (EO) No. 429 was issued in 1990 by President Corazon Aquino which provided for the reorganization of the administrative regions in Mindanao. It declared that Western Mindanao would comprise Zamboanga City, Lanao del Norte, Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Basilan, and the cities comprising those provinces. It also declared that Pagadian shall serve as the new regional center.

In 1996, President Fidel Ramos issued EO No. 325 which reorganized the Regional Development Councils. The Implementing Rules and Regulations of EO No. 325 provided that Zamboanga City is the regional center of Western Mindanao.

In 2001, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed EO No. 36 which reorganized and renamed Western Mindanao to Zamboanga Peninsula. It was silent on the issue of regional government centers. 

In 2004, Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 75 directed the transfer of regional offices from Zamboanga City to Pagadian citing EO No. 429 as its legal basis. However, it provided that the regional offices of the departments of Trade and Industry, Tourism, and Labor and Employment will remain in Zamboanga City, but shall establish a presence in Pagadian.

On December 22, 2010, MC No. 11 was issued imposing a moratorium on the transfer of regional offices to Pagadian. The Circular cited the high economic and social costs that the employees were experiencing in maintaining two residences and in fully transferring to Pagadian. It further directed all regional offices that are already in Pagadian to continue their operations.

On June 30, 2020, MC No. 78 was issued, repealing MC No. 11 and lifting the moratorium on the transfer of the remaining regional offices to Pagadian. The Circular affirmed that Pagadian is the regional government center while Zamboanga City is the commercial and industrial center of Region IX.

On April 19, 2023, under MC No. 18, another moratorium was imposed on the transfer of regional offices to Pagadian pending further study of its implications. The regional offices that are already in Pagadian shall continue to operate thereat.

== Geography ==
The region is located on the western part of the island of Mindanao, that lies between the Moro Gulf (part of the Celebes Sea) and the Sulu Sea. Along the shores of the peninsula are numerous bays and islands of varying sizes. The peninsula is connected to the rest of Mindanao through an isthmus situated between Panguil Bay and Pagadian Bay. The region consists of the three Zamboanga provinces and the highly urbanized independent city of Zamboanga, and the boundary between the peninsula and mainland is artificially marked by the border between the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur and Lanao del Norte. The province of Misamis Occidental occupies the northeast corner of the geographic peninsula, but is part of the Northern Mindanao administrative region, which also includes Misamis Oriental on the Mindanao mainland, formerly both part of pre-1929 Misamis (province) along the shores of Iligan Bay.

=== Administrative divisions ===
==== Provinces ====
Zamboanga Peninsula comprises 3 Provinces; 1 independent, chartered and highly urbanized city; 3 component cities; 67 municipalities and 1,904 barangays.

Sulu, which was excluded from the Bangsamoro region, has an unclear status. The Commission on Elections &quot;en banc&quot; however had the consensus that Sulu should revert back to the Zamboanga Peninsula, the region it belonged to prior its inclusion in the ARMM back in 1989.

===== Governors and vice governors =====
==== Cities ====
Dapitan is one of the two cities of Zamboanga del Norte. Known as the &quot;Shrine City in the Philippines&quot;, this was where José Rizal, the national hero of the country, was exiled. It is also known for the old St. James Parish and the beach resort of Dakak.

Dipolog, capital of Zamboanga del Norte, is known for their abundance of orchids, thus it is called &quot;Orchid City of the South&quot; or &quot;Orchid City&quot;. They have their nature spots and historical spots, such as Dipolog Cathedral, Dipolog Boulevard, Cogon Park, Japanese Park, Plaza Magsaysay, the Sungkilaw Falls, and the 3,003 steps to Linabo Peak.

Isabela is a component city of the province of Basilan. Until 2017, it was the capital of the said province, since then, Basilan&#x27;s government was moved to Lamitan. Isabela continues to be under the jurisdiction of Basilan for the administration of provincially devolved services and functions, but for regional and statistics purposes, the city is part of Zamboanga Peninsula, in contrast to the rest of Basilan which is under BARMM. Named after Queen Isabella II, Isabela was the southernmost outpost of the Spanish Empire in the Philippines until the fall of Jolo in 1878. It hosted a Spanish fort (later destroyed in World War II) since 1848, and was the primary naval base of the Spanish in Mindanao until 1899. The city serves as an entry point for trade and commerce of Basilan island.

Pagadian is the capital of Zamboanga del Sur, as well as the region&#x27;s administrative center. The city is known as the &quot;Little Hong Kong of the South&quot; because of its topographical feature that is reminiscent of Hong Kong. It also has an affluent Chinese community that officially celebrates the Chinese Lunar New Year.

Zamboanga City is the only highly urbanized city in the region. Geographically located at the southwestern tip of the peninsula, the city continues to be the economic and industrial center of the region, generating more than half of its economy. The city is the lone member of BIMP-EAGA in the Zamboanga Peninsula. It also has the largest airport and seaport and the city in the region with most investors.

== Demographics ==
== Economy ==

The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) released the first ever report of the Provincial Product Accounts (PPA) of Zamboanga Peninsula covering the period 2018 to 2022. The release covers three provinces, namely, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, and Zamboanga Sibugay, as well as the cities of Zamboanga and Isabela. The PPA results showed that in 2022, the city of Zamboanga accounted for 32.6 percent of the region&#x27;s total economy, followed by Zamboanga del Norte with a share of 26.8 percent, Zamboanga del Sur with 23.7 percent, and Zamboanga Sibugay with 14.1 percent. Meanwhile, the city of Isabela recorded a 2.7 percent share.

In terms of growth rate, all economies in the region expanded in 2022, with Zamboanga Sibugay recording the fastest growth of 8.6 percent, followed by city of Zamboanga with a growth rate of 8.1 percent, both of which were higher than the region&#x27;s economic growth of 7.5 percent. On the other hand, the city of Isabela, Zamboanga del Norte, and Zamboanga del Sur posted growth rates of 7.21 percent, 7.17 percent, and 6.5 percent, respectively.

The region has the first export-processing zone in Mindanao. Farming and fishing are the main economic activities of the region. It also has rice and corn mills, oil processing, coffee berry processing and processing of latex from rubber. Its home industries include rattan and furniture craft, basket making, weaving and brass work. Dipolog is home to a number of Bottled Sardines Companies which are being exported abroad. Meanwhile, Dapitan is home to several tourist spots, such as Dakak Park and Beach Resort, Rizal Shrine, and Glorious Fantasyland, one of the very few amusement parks located in Mindanao.

While Pagadian is the region&#x27;s new regional center, Zamboanga City’s economy remains to be the most robust and fastest growing in the region. Zamboanga City also retains the title of being the commercial and industrial center of the region.

=== Resources ===
The region has vast forest resources and previously used to export logs, lumber, veneer and plywood. Mineral deposits include gold, chromite, coal, iron, lead, and manganese. Among its non-metallic reserves are coal, silica, salt, marble, silica sand, and gravel. Its fishing grounds are devoted to commercial and municipal fishing. It has also aqua farms for brackish water and freshwater fishes.

=== Area of Growth ===
The economic fulcrum of the region lies at the center of the peninsula that is the area connecting Ipil and Liloy. Along with its premiere towns of Sindangan and Molave, it has the fastest economic activity of the region. The 50-kilometer link between the north and the south would act as the main artery of economy in the region.

<text>University of Limerick (UL) () is a public research university institution in Limerick, Ireland. Founded in 1972, as the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, it became a university in September 1989 in accordance with the University of Limerick Act 1989. It was the first university established since Irish independence in 1922, followed by the establishment of Dublin City University.

UL&#x27;s campus lies along both sides of the River Shannon, on a site with on the north bank and on the south bank at Plassey, County Limerick, from the city centre. It has over 11,000 full-time undergraduate students, including over 2,400 international students, and 1,500 part-time students. There are over 800 research postgraduates and 1,300 postgraduate students receiving instruction at the university. Its co-operative education (&quot;co-op&quot;) programme offers students an up to eight-month work placement as part of their degree; it was Ireland&#x27;s first such programme.

Following founding president Edward M. Walsh, Roger GH Downer, John O&#x27;Connor, Don Barry, Des Fitzgerald and Kerstin Mey were presidents of UL from 1998 to August 2024. The current acting president is Professor Shane Kilcommins.

==History==

===University campaign===
According to founding president Edward M. Walsh, the mayor of Limerick applied for a college of the planned Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland to be established in the city. However, in 1850, Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast, Cork and Galway were established instead. In 1908 there was an attempt to link the National University of Ireland and Mungret College, about five kilometres from Limerick. Mungret offered bachelor&#x27;s- and master&#x27;s-level courses in the faculty of arts, with degrees conferred by the Royal University of Ireland, from 1888 to 1908. The university was dissolved in 1909 and replaced by the National University of Ireland, marking the end of tertiary education at Mungret. Degrees were awarded to students at Mungret College by the NUI from 1909 to 1912 to accommodate students who had matriculated at the Royal University.

The campaign for a university in Limerick began in earnest by the late 1950s. The Limerick University Project Committee was founded in September 1959 by the mayor of Limerick in 1957, Ted Russell. Another supporter, Dermot Kinlen, was a High Court judge and the first state inspector general of prisons and places of detention. Russell and Kinlen received honorary degrees from the university in 2002.

===National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick===
The introduction in 1968 of Free Education in Ireland by Limerick Education Minister Donogh O&#x27;Malley - O&#x27;Malley actually bought the current 340 acre UL Plassey site for the State from the Bugler family in 1967 - and his plans for nine Institutes of Higher Education followed by successful economic-development policies during the 1960s led to an influx of foreign investment into Ireland and demand for expertise not met by the existing universities. Ireland established the National Institute for Higher Education (NIHE) at Limerick, modelled on the technological universities of continental Europe, and perhaps the polytechnic approach being developed in the UK. Edward Walsh took office as chairman of the planning board and director of the institute on 1 January 1970. This more twentieth-century and continental approach is illustrated by its use of funding from the World Bank, European Investment Bank and philanthropists. Construction on phase one, for example, used financing from the World Bank. Faculty and staff were recruited internationally, and they — in addition to extensive teaching and research facilities — attracted foreign investment led by Analog Devices (which manufactured Ireland&#x27;s first silicon chips).

The first students were enrolled in 1972, when the institute was opened by Taoiseach Jack Lynch. The European Investment Bank financed the second phase of development. Billionaire philanthropist Chuck Feeney was a major donor to the university. Shannon Development was also an early supporter of the project, supporting the NIHE proposal to establish the National Technological Park as an integrated campus.

A change of government resulted in NIHE Limerick applying for recognition as a recognised college of the National University of Ireland, which awarded degrees to its graduates in 1977. After strong opposition by students and others, NIHE Limerick withdrew from the NUI and was established as an independent institution. From 1978 to 1988, the National Council for Educational Awards (NCEA) was the degree-awarding authority for NIHE Limerick.

===University status===
In 1989, NIHE Limerick was established by legislation as the University of Limerick and NIHE Dublin was established as Dublin City University, each with the power to award its own degrees. These became the first institutes since Irish independence to be given the title &quot;university&quot;.

Expansion occurred in 1991, after the incorporation of Thomond College of Education, Limerick. Thomond, sharing a common campus, was founded in 1973 as the National College of Physical Education and became the department of educational and professional studies, focusing on secondary education. Since 1991, degrees from Mary Immaculate College have also been awarded by UL. MIC degrees are offered in primary education and arts programmes, and degrees awarded at St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Thurles have been conferred by UL since 2012. University history under the leadership of founding president Edward M Walsh is profiled in Walsh&#x27;s 2011 memoir, &quot;Upstart: Friends, Foes and Founding a University&quot;.

Elements of the US university system were adopted, including cooperative education, grade point average marking and the trimester system. During the 1970s, limited public financing led Walsh and his team to seek World Bank and European Investment Bank funding. Sophisticated private-sector fundraising programmes were later developed, based on US university models and guided by an international leadership board under founding chair Chuck Feeney and Lewis Glucksman. The campus developed primarily as a result of such fundraising activity.

The university has been an active participant in the European Union&#x27;s Erasmus Programme since 1988 and has 207 partner institutions in 24 European countries. In addition, UL students may study at partner universities in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, China and Singapore.

UL allied with NUI Galway in 2010, sharing resources.

==Organisation==
===Governance===
In accordance with legislation, the university is directed by a policy-making Governing Authority, whose functions are outlined in the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, Act, 1980, amended in the University of Limerick Act, 1989, which raised the institution&#x27;s status to that of a university and provided for related matters. There are several other important acts concerning the college include the Universities Act, 1997, which allows for the creation of University Statutes.

The Governing Authority&#x27;s 29 members are chosen by a wide range of groups and authorities and include members elected by staff (in various classes) and students (ex-officio based on elections of Students Union officers).

The university is headed, titularly, by the Chancellor. As of 2023, the Chancellor of the University of Limerick is Brigid Laffan. Previous chancellors included Miriam Hederman O&#x27;Brien, Seán Donlon and Mary Harney.

===Faculty===

The university has four faculties:
* Kemmy Business School (Scoil Ghnó Kemmy)
* Faculty of Education and Health Sciences (including the Graduate Medical School)
* Faculty of Science and Engineering
* Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences
Two colleges are linked to the university: Mary Immaculate College and MIC, St. Patrick&#x27;s Campus, Thurles.

Kemmy Business School has Triple Crown accreditation (AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA). It has four academic departments, which are Accounting &amp; Finance, Economics, Management &amp; Marketing, and Personnel &amp; Employment Relations. The school&#x27;s courses include accounting, finance, economics, marketing, and risk management among other courses. Named after the former mayor of Limerick, Jim Kemmy, the business school has both undergraduate and postgraduate courses on offer.

The Faculty of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences currently offers the only English-language Masters degree in technical communication outside of the United States

===Students===

UL has a students&#x27; union, branded as UL Student Life (ULSL). It is presided over by four sabbatical officers: a president, an academic officer, a welfare officer and a communities officer. Policy decisions are made by the sabbatical officers and a council of class representatives. The union is the representative body for the 18,000 undergraduate UL students. It operates from their office in the main courtyard, which has space for students to relax. ULSU Ents, part of the students&#x27; union, organises entertainment for university students throughout the year, with many events taking place during Freshers Week and Charity Week.

The university also has a postgraduate students&#x27; union with a full-time, sabbatical postgraduate president. It is one of two Irish universities with such a position.

===Clubs and societies===
UL has over 70 student-run clubs and societies. Clubs are supported by the students&#x27; union, the sports department and the arts office. In March 2014, the clubs and societies refused to recognise the Pro-Life Society—the first society not recognised by the student council. Since then, every new club or society must be voted on by the council and undergo a trial period (usually 14 weeks).

===President&#x27;s Volunteer Award===
The President&#x27;s Volunteer Award (PVA), administered by the university&#x27;s community-liaison office, was established to harness, acknowledge and support the contributions which students at the University of Limerick make to their communities. It draws on a strong tradition of student volunteerism on and off-campus. The PVA&#x27;s primary goals are:
* To sustain and foster a culture of volunteerism, active citizenship and civic engagement among the student population
* To develop collaborative projects and further existing initiatives between UL and the community
* To formally acknowledge and support the contributions which UL student volunteers make to the community
* To promote the development of civic and leadership skills in students.

===Rankings===

The university is ranked fourth in attracting students who attain over 500 points on the Leaving Certificate. It is the only college in Ireland to receive a maximum five stars for its sports facilities.

UL is ranked 426th worldwide in the 2024 QS World University Rankings and 401-500 in the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

It was the 2015 University of the Year in &quot;the Sunday Times&quot;″ Good University Guide because of the university&#x27;s record in graduate employability, improved academic performance, the €52-million Bernal Project and a strong record in research commercialisation. UL is Ireland&#x27;s only university to receive five stars for graduate employability and teaching in the 2011–12 QS reports. The school also received five stars for infrastructure, internationalisation, innovation and engagement.

==Science and engineering==





==The arts==

UL is home to the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, a centre for innovation and research in music and dance performance and scholarship, and the Irish Chamber Orchestra (Ireland&#x27;s leading international chamber orchestra, funded by An Chomhairle Ealaíon (the Irish Arts Council). All three organisations commission and perform new Irish music and dance.

The University Concert Hall (UCH) is UL&#x27;s principal venue for the performing arts. The 1,000-seat hall was Ireland&#x27;s first purpose-built concert hall.

The Bourn Vincent Gallery is UL&#x27;s principal venue for temporary exhibitions, with an ancillary programme of seminars, lectures and performances. UL&#x27;s art collection includes outdoor sculpture by international artists, including Michael Warren, Peter Logan, Alexandra Wejchert, James McKenna, Tom Fitzgerald, Antony Gormley and (most recently) Sean Scully.

==Housing==
Many housing districts near UL have a majority-student population, especially in the adjacent Castletroy area. In recent years, several large student apartment complexes have been built a 15-20-minute walk from UL with Section 50 tax incentives. Unlike most similar Irish higher education institutes, much housing is on-campus; there are five on-campus student villages, the newest opening in 2006.

The oldest is Plassey Village, opposite UL&#x27;s main gate. Accommodating 424 students in terraced houses with four or eight bedrooms and a kitchen-living area, it is primarily occupied by first-year students. Built from 1987 to 1992 in four phases, it has a village hall and many small gardens. During the summers of 2010 and 2011, the village&#x27;s residences were renovated.

Kilmurry Village, the second-oldest student village, is on the east of the campus. It accommodates 540 students in six- or eight-bedroom terraced houses. It is the closest village to the University Arena, which has an Olympic-standard 50-metre swimming pool. The village was built between 1994 and 1997 in two phases. Minor renovations were made during summer 2011, primarily to the kitchens.

Dromroe Village, completed in 2001, is on the south bank of the Shannon. The first high-rise building houses 457 students in six-, four- or two-bedroom ensuite apartments.

Thomond Village, which opened for the autumn 2004 semester, were the first university buildings on the north bank of the Shannon in County Clare. It has accommodation for 504 students in six-, four-, two- and one-bedroom apartments.

Cappavilla Village, the newest student village, opened in September 2006 on the North Bank near the new Health Sciences Building. An extension of Cappavilla opened in September 2007.

Many off-campus student accommodations vary in distance from the campus. Elm Park, College Court, Briarfield and Oaklawns are popular estates with many student residences. Troy Student Village and Courtyard Hall, privately managed student residences slightly further from the campus, are served by a shuttle bus.

==Sport==
===University Arena===
The on-campus University Arena is Ireland&#x27;s largest indoor sports complex. Open since 2002, it consists of the National 50m Swimming Pool. The arena&#x27;s Indoor Sports Hall has four wooden courts for a variety of sports, a sprint track, an international 400 m athletics track and a 200 m, three-lane, suspended jogging track. The facility has a cardiovascular and strength-training centre, a weight-training room, team rooms, an aerobics studio and classrooms. The arena is often used by the Munster rugby team.

Its €28 million development was made possible with €7.6 million in government grants, a €6.9 million donation from the University of Limerick Foundation, about €4 million in student contributions and commercial funding. Each year, it accommodates over 500,000 customers and many international athletes and teams.

The arena hosted the 2010 Special Olympics Ireland Games, from 9 to 13 June. In one of the year&#x27;s largest Irish sporting events, 1,900 Special Olympians from throughout Ireland participated in the games.

===All-weather sports complex===
UL&#x27;s €9 million, all-weather sports complex on the North Campus is the largest all-weather sports-field complex in Europe. The multi-purpose, floodlit, artificial turf park has two soccer, one rugby and one GAA pitch. Third-generation all-weather surfaces are similar to natural grass and are designed for full contact. Each full-size pitch can be sub-divided to create smaller playing areas for various sports. The largest artificial-grass development in Ireland to date, it is designed to World Rugby, GAA and FIFA specifications.

The synthetic surface reduces the risk of injury caused by hard or uneven surfaces. The Sports Pavilion Building has changing rooms, squad and coaching rooms and bar, restaurant and conference facilities. The complex is funded from a number of sources, including operating income and campus-based commercial activities.

The playing pitches opened in July 2011, and the Sports Pavilion was expected to open in November 2011. The facility is available to the general public as well as the campus community. In addition to these facilities, conventional playing fields, tennis courts, an artificial-turf pitch, an outdoor athletics track and the University Boathouse are on the Limerick side of the river. The boathouse has Ireland&#x27;s only indoor rowing tank, which can accommodate up to 8 rowers simultaneously. The tank can simulate a variety of water conditions, providing training opportunities for rowers to reach international standards. The building also includes a launch jetty into the Shannon, a pontoon and a café.

==Expansion==


The university&#x27;s Foundation Building, including the University Concert Hall (home to the Irish Chamber Orchestra), the library and several others, were built during the 1990s. The Materials &amp; Surface Science Institute (MSSI) building, Dromroe Student Village, a sports arena and swimming pool were built between 2000 and 2004. In 2005, the Engineering Research Building and Millstream Courtyard buildings opened in a complex near the Foundation Building.

The Kemmy Business School building was constructed next to the Schuman Building, and will be the world&#x27;s first business school with a live trading floor. Several new buildings have opened on the north bank of the Shannon. The University Bridge, opened in late 2004, provides road and pedestrian access to the planned North Bank campus. Thomond Village was the first North Bank facility (opening in 2004), followed by the Health Sciences Building in 2005. The Living Bridge, a pedestrian bridge, connects the Millstream Courtyard and the Health Sciences Building. Cappavilla Village was completed in mid-2006 on the North Bank; a building for the Irish World Music Centre (formerly in the Foundation Building basement), began construction in May 2007 and was completed in January 2010. An architectural-faculty building is under construction opposite the CSIS building. The university hopes to expand the North Bank campus to the size of the original campus.

===Limerick 2030===
UL has committed to a presence in Limerick city centre as part of the Limerick 2030 plan to help drive renewal of the city centre. All the university&#x27;s main faculties are presently in Castletroy, about 5 km from the city centre. Former UL president Don Barry outlined his vision of the plan in July 2013: &quot;My dream is that in a few years’ time, there will be hundreds of students of the university participating in the life of the city, learning in the city, recreating in the city and contributing to the revitalisation of the Limerick city centre. Limerick is our city and we are its university.&quot;

<text>Stafford Castle is an ancient Grade II listed castle situated two miles west of the town of Stafford in Staffordshire, England. From the time of the Norman Conquest and as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 it was the seat of the powerful Anglo-Norman Stafford family (originally &quot;de Tosny&quot;, later via a female line &quot;de Stafford&quot;), feudal barons of Stafford, later Barons Stafford (1299) by writ, Earls of Stafford (1351) and Dukes of Buckingham (1444). The 14th-century stone keep was demolished in 1643, during the Civil War, having been held for the Royalists by Lady Isabel Stafford. The castle was remodelled in the early 19th century by the Jerningham family in the Gothic Revival style, on the foundations of the medieval structure, and incorporates much of the original stonework. Today the A518 Stafford-to-Newport Road passes next to it and it is a prominent local landmark visible from the M6 motorway and from the West Coast inter-city mainline.

==History==

===A Saxon castle at Stafford===
The early historian of Staffordshire Robert Plot cited the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (104) for evidence that Æthelflæd, the Saxon warrior-princess and ruler of the Mercians, built a castle at Stafford in the year 913, along with an adjacent &quot;burg&quot; (meaning a fortified town). However, the exact site of this first castle, probably made of wood, is now unknown.

===Medieval===
====Saxon====
Shortly before the castle was built the Saxon Eadric the Wild had led a failed rebellion which culminated in the defeat of the Saxons at the Battle of Stafford in 1069.

====Norman====
A wooden castle was built on the site at some time in the 1070s by the Norman magnate Robert de Stafford (c.1039–c.1100) (&quot;alias&quot; Robert de Tosny/Toeni, etc.) who arrived in England during or shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066 and was awarded by King William the Conqueror 131 manors in his newly conquered kingdom, predominantly in the county of Staffordshire. Thus he was able to control and extract taxes from the native Anglo-Saxon community and to prepare for the Norman invasion of Wales in 1081. The castle was originally a timber and earth fortification, built on modified glacial deposit. The first castle was built in the usual form of a motte and bailey.

Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford, one of the King&#x27;s leading commanders in the first phases of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, sealed a contract with a master mason in 1347, ordering a stone castle to be built on the castle mound. The rectangular stone keep originally had a tower in each corner, but was later adapted, with a fifth tower being added on in the middle of the north wall (actually facing west).

===Early Modern===

The stone castle reached its heyday during the time of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1402–1460), who was killed at the Battle of Northampton in 1460. His grandson Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (1455–1483) had become a ward of the Yorkists and was initially a supporter of Richard III, but later rebelled in favour of the aborted invasion of Henry Tudor (Henry VII) in 1483, and paid with his life. His son Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (1478–1521) escaped and was later restored to his lands by a grateful King Henry VII. In 1511 the 3rd Duke built himself a further grand residence at Thornbury Castle in Gloucestershire, effectively a fortified manor house. His royal blood made him a threat to Henry VIII, who had him executed in 1521, when the family&#x27;s estates, including Stafford Castle and its deer parks, escheated to the Crown. The king&#x27;s auditors commented favourably on the deer to be had in the parks and thought the castle might be a suitable stop-off on one of the King&#x27;s progresses.

Stafford Castle, along with a small parcel of land, was restored to the later Staffords, but they never regained the wealth or status of earlier years. Through lack of maintenance, the keep fell into disrepair and in 1603 Edward Stafford, 3rd Baron Stafford referred in a letter to &#x27;My rotten castle of Stafford.&#x27;

During the early phases of the Civil War in 1643 it was held by Lady Isabel Stafford (née Isabel Forster), a staunch Roman Catholic and Royalist, the widow of Edward Stafford, 4th Baron Stafford (1572–1625), who had been buried at the Castle Church, Stafford.
The Parliamentarians had captured the town of Stafford on 15 May 1643, following a brief siege, but some of its garrison escaped and held Stafford Castle, in the hope of using it as a bridgehead to recapture the town. Colonel William Brereton rode up to the castle with some of his men and called upon Lady Stafford to surrender, to which she refused. In response &quot;some of the poor outhouses were set on fire to try whether these would work their spirits to any relenting. All in vain, for from the castle they shot some of our men and horses which did much enrage and provoke the rest to an act of fierce revenge. Almost all the dwelling houses and outhouses were burnt to the ground.&quot; The siege was raised when Colonel Hastings led a relief column which arrived on 5 June. Lady Stafford was eventually persuaded to leave, a small garrison remaining to defend the castle against a renewed siege. Finally, in late June, the Royalist garrison fled, having heard that a large Parliamentarian army was approaching, complete with siege cannon capable of overwhelming the small garrison. The castle then fell into Parliamentarian control and was demolished. On 22 December, not many months after its capture, the &quot;Parliamentarian Committee of Stafford&quot; ordered: &quot;the Castle shall be forthwith demolished.&quot; When the traveller and diarist, Celia Fiennes passed through the town of Stafford in 1698, she noted: &quot;...the castle which is now ruinated and there only remains on a hill the fortified trenches that are grown over green.&quot;

===Re-emergence===

By the 1790s only a single low wall remained to be seen above ground, and that was at risk of falling. Some workmen employed to underpin this wall discovered the buried castle basements and foundations, which ran off from the wall. Realising the likely extent of these basements, and the possibility of treasures within, they brought their discovery to the attention of Sir William Jerningham. Jerningham immediately ordered all the foundations and basements to be uncovered, and the whole mound to be cleared of overgrowth.

The castle was partly rebuilt in the Gothic Revival Style from 1813. Yet this work was soon discontinued partly through the lack of funds, and also because the Jerningham family were elevated to the peerage (one of their motives for the restoration project). Dubbed by some as a &#x27;folly&#x27;, this was never the case, as the Keep was always intended to be lived in, and was occupied well into the 20th century.

===Post-war===
In the immediate post-war years, the mature woodland that surrounded the Keep was felled, which may have led to the structure being exposed to high winds. By 1949 large pieces of masonry had begun to fall from the towers, which were declared unsafe. Mr. and Mrs. Stokes, the last caretakers of the castle and its grounds, vacated the building that winter. The site became a target for vandals and in 1961 Lord Stafford gave the Keep to the local authority.

In 1978 professional excavations began to show the complex archaeology of the site, which had been for generations the seat of one of the most important families in the region. The excavations continued for many years, becoming one of the area&#x27;s biggest employers of young people during the severe economic depression of the early 1980s. These excavations and establishment of a reconstructed medieval herb garden were documented over many years by the BBC.

On the site&#x27;s official public opening in 1988, a heritage trail was established with signage and interpretation, and new fencing on improved trails. In 1992 a new purpose-built museum and gift/refreshments shop opened on-site below the castle mound.

<doc id="258863" wikidata="Q880976" url="?curid=258863" title="Ted Kulongoski">
<text>Theodore Ralph Kulongoski ( ; born November 5, 1940) is an American politician, judge, and lawyer who served as the 36th Governor of Oregon from 2003 to 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly and also served as the state Insurance Commissioner. He was the Attorney General of Oregon from 1993 to 1997 and a justice of the Oregon Supreme Court from 1997 to 2001. Kulongoski has served in all three branches of the Oregon state government.

==Early life and education==
Kulongoski was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1940 to Theodore Kulongoski (1905-1941), the son of Polish immigrants, and his wife Helen, née Newcomer (1915-1997). He was one year old when his father died of cancer, and spent the rest of his childhood in a Catholic boys&#x27; home. After high school, Kulongoski served in the Marines. With the help of the G.I. Bill, he obtained an undergraduate and Juris Doctor from the University of Missouri School of Law in 1970.

==Career==

After graduating from law school, Kulongoski moved to Eugene, Oregon, and became a labor lawyer. In 1974, Kulongoski was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives and, in 1978, to the Oregon State Senate. In Oregon&#x27;s 1980 United States Senate election, he ran an unsuccessful race against Republican Bob Packwood. In 1982, he made his first bid for governor; he was defeated by Republican incumbent Victor G. Atiyeh.

At the 1980 Democratic National Convention then-State Senator and U.S. Senate nominee Kulongoski received 8 (0.24%) delegate votes for Vice President of the United States. Kulongoski was not a candidate and incumbent Walter Mondale was easily renominated.

In 1987, Oregon Governor Neil Goldschmidt appointed Kulongoski to the post of state insurance commissioner. In that role, Kulongoski reformed the state&#x27;s workers&#x27; compensation insurance system, a move that is widely credited for lowering costs to business.

===1992 and 1996 elections===
In 1992, Kulongoski was elected as Oregon Attorney General, defeating Republican Rich Rodeman. As Attorney General, he focused on reforming the juvenile justice system. In 1996, Kulongoski decided against running for re-election as Attorney General, and instead successfully ran for the Oregon Supreme Court. He resigned from the court in 2001 to run for governor.

===2002 gubernatorial election===

After winning the Democratic party nomination in the 2002 race for governor, Kulongoski&#x27;s opponent was Republican Kevin Mannix. Kulongoski ran a low-key campaign, emphasizing his reputation as a consensus-builder and problem solver. His television commercials featured such feel-good scenes as the candidate bowling. He argued for a pragmatic approach to solving the state&#x27;s budget crisis and recession, a marked departure from the more confrontational style of outgoing governor (and fellow Democrat) John Kitzhaber. Mannix argued that the Democratic Party had held the governorship in Oregon too long, and pledged to reduce government spending without cutting vital services. Kulongoski narrowly won the election, winning 618,004 votes (49%), with 581,785 votes (46%) going to Mannix, and 57,760 votes (5%) going to Libertarian candidate Tom Cox.

Kulongoski took office on January 13, 2003. He inherited a state facing a massive budget deficit and high unemployment. Furthermore, he faced the task of dealing with problems with the public employees&#x27; pension system without angering the labor unions that backed his campaign. As Governor, he was a member of the National Governors Association and the Democratic Governors Association.

===2006 gubernatorial election===
On December 1, 2005, the Eugene &quot;Register-Guard&quot; reported that former Democratic Governor John Kitzhaber was considering challenging Kulongoski in the Democratic primary. One month later, Kitzhaber announced he would not do so, as did another potential Democratic rival, State Senator Vicki Walker. This left Kulongoski with two challengers: Lane County Commissioner Pete Sorenson, and former State treasurer Jim Hill, both of whom accused Kulongoski of betraying Democratic Party principles. Stated Hill, &quot;From my standpoint, [the Democratic Party primary debate] is a good opportunity to show what a horrible Democrat Ted has been&quot;. The Service Employees International Union Local 503 endorsed Jim Hill, and the Multnomah County Democratic Central Committee decided to endorse Kulongoski&#x27;s rivals but not him at a February 19, 2006 meeting.

On May 16, 2006, Kulongoski won the Democratic primary with 54% of the vote. Jim Hill finished second with 25%, Pete Sorenson third with 16% of the vote.

Kulongoski faced multiple opponents in the general election: Republican Party candidate Ron Saxton, Constitution Party candidate Mary Starrett, Libertarian Party candidate Richard Morley, and Pacific Green Party candidate Joe Keating. Former Republican Ben Westlund planned on running as independent, but on August 10, 2006, withdrew from the race, stating that &quot;I made a commitment to the people of Oregon that I was in it to win it and that I absolutely would not play a spoiler role&quot;.

On November 7, 2006, Kulongoski won a second term, 51% to 43% over Ron Saxton.

===Second term===

In February 2007, Kulongoski and State Senator Brad Avakian worked to clarify that Oregon recognizes no position of &quot;state climatologist&quot; in response to the use of that title by Oregon State University professor George H. Taylor, who believes that human activities are not the main cause of global climate change. Kulongoski said the state needs a consistent message on reducing greenhouse gases to combat climate change.

Beginning the week of April 24, 2007, Kulongoski gained national attention when he joined a campaign, known as the food stamp challenge, that portrays the difficulty living on the average weekly food stamp allotment of $21.

Kulongski announced May 8, 2007 that Oregon will join the Climate Registry to track dangerous greenhouse gas emissions.

Kulongoski signed two LGBT rights bills into law: a domestic partnership bill and an anti-discrimination bill at a ceremony May 9, 2007.

In May 2010, Kulongoski suffered a vitreous hemorrhage in the eye due to fragile, abnormal blood vessels that have grown in the retina of the eye. According to Kulongoski spokeswoman Anna Richter Taylor, he was scheduled for outpatient surgery at Oregon Health &amp; Science University on June 30, 2010, to surgically remove the vitreous gel from the middle of the eye so full vision can be restored.

===Later life===
After leaving the governor&#x27;s office, he was appointed by John Kitzhaber to the Public Safety Commission as part of a review of Oregon&#x27;s sentencing guidelines. In 2012, Kulongoski joined the faculty at Portland State University in the school&#x27;s Mark O. Hatfield School of Government.

<text>Waikikamukau (, as if saying &quot;Why kick a moo cow&quot;) is a generic name for a small rural town or locality in New Zealand. New Zealanders use the name as a placeholder name for &quot;any town&quot; or to denote a non-specific but remote rural town. It has a similar connotation to the New Zealand slang Wop Wops
and the Australian term Woop Woop and other appellations such as the &quot;Boondocks&quot; or &quot;Timbuktu&quot;. The name is a joking reference to the frequency of New Zealand place names starting with &quot;Wai&quot; (Māori for water, and used in the names of many rivers and nearby towns).

Waikikamukau is reputed to specifically refer to the town of Waipukurau in the North Island. The origins are hazy but one account is that the American servicemen stationed in NZ during the Second World War found it difficult to pronounce the place name and thus jokingly called it Waikikamukau. However the name has been in use at least since 1930.

It was used as the name of a successful racehorse in the 1990s.

Waikikamukau was also used as the setting for a Nickelodeon telemovie, &quot;Rocket Power: Race Across New Zealand&quot;.

<doc id="258870" wikidata="Q1380278" url="?curid=258870" title="Riothamus">
<text>&#x27; (also spelled &#x27; or ) was a Romano-British military leader, who was active circa AD 470. He fought against the Goths in alliance with the declining Western Roman Empire. He is called &quot;King of the Britons&quot; by the 6th-century historian Jordanes, but the extent of his realm is unclear. Some Arthurian scholars identify Riothamus as one of the possible sources of the legendary King Arthur.

==Name==
 is a Latinization of the Brythonic , meaning &#x27;Great King&#x27;, &#x27;Kingliest&#x27;. Alternatively, it may come from Brittonic , meaning &#x27;Freest&#x27;. The Brittonic form survived into Old Welsh as (Modern Welsh ) and Old Breton .

==Realm==
It is not clear whether Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Britons&quot; refers to the Britons of Great Britain itself, or of Armorica, which was undergoing significant British settlement and later came to be known as Brittany.

The Old Breton name , which (like Riothamus) is derived from Brittonic , appears in medieval Breton records (primarily biographies of early Breton saints) as one of the Princes of Domnonée (a coastal region in Brittany which takes its name from Dumnonia in southern Britain). He is identified as a son of Deroch II. For chronological reasons, this Riatam is probably a different individual from Jordanes&#x27; Riothamus, who lived earlier.

==Correspondence with Sidonius Apollinaris==
More secure information is provided by a letter which has survived that was written to Riothamus from Sidonius Apollinaris, bishop of Clermont, who requested his judgment for &quot;an obscure and humble person&quot; who had had his slaves enticed away by a group of armed Bretons. According to C.E.V. Nixon, the letter is evidence that Armorica at this time was becoming &quot;like a magnet to peasants, , slaves and the hard-pressed&quot; as Roman power weakened. Poorer subjects of Rome with no stake in land ownership found Breton territory to be a safe haven from the Goths.

===The letter===
: 

===Translation===
:To his friend Riothamus
: I will write once more in my usual strain, mingling compliment with grievance. Not that I at all desire to follow up the first words of greeting with disagreeable subjects, but things seem to be always happening which a man of my order and in my position can neither mention without unpleasantness, nor pass over without neglect of duty. Yet I do my best to remember the burdensome and delicate sense of honour which makes you so ready to blush for others&#x27; faults. The bearer of this is an obscure and humble person, so harmless, insignificant, and helpless that he seems to invite his own discomfiture; his grievance is that the Bretons are secretly enticing his slaves away. Whether his indictment is a true one, I cannot say; but if you can only confront the parties and decide the matter on its merits, I think the unfortunate man may be able to make good his charge, if indeed a stranger from the country unarmed, abject and impecunious to boot, has ever a chance of a fair or kindly hearing against adversaries with all the advantages he lacks, arms, astuteness, turbulences, and the aggressive spirit of men backed by numerous friends. Farewell.

==War with the Goths==
Jordanes states that Riothamus supported the Romans against the Visigoths led by Euric (who lived c. 440 – 484). In &quot;The Origin and Deeds of the Goths&quot;, he states that Riothamus brought a British army to supplement Roman forces but suffered defeat fighting against overwhelming odds when the Goths intercepted his force:

===Jordanes, Getica, XLV.237–238===
====Translation====
A letter from Sidonius Apollinaris to his friend Vincentius, written circa 468 AD, records that Roman officials intercepted a letter written by the Praetorian Prefect of Gaul, Arvandus, to the Visigothic king Euric stating that &quot;the Britons stationed beyond the Loire should be attacked&quot; and that the Visigoths and Burgundians (who were at the time clients of the Romans) should divide Gaul between them; this has led some scholars (such as Geoffrey Ashe) to suggest that Arvandus betrayed Riothamus. This letter does not mention Riothamus by name, however, and (based on the reconstruction of the chronology of Sidonius&#x27; letters), it is possible that Riothamus and his forces were not the direct subject of Arvandus&#x27; message to Euric, as Arvandus was already under arrest and on his way to Rome before Riothamus had even entered the fray against the Visigoths, sometime between 470 and 472 AD (the latter being the year of emperor Anthemius&#x27; death).

===Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum, II.18===
Gregory of Tours seems to react to the outcome of the battle between the Visigoths and Britons:

====Translation====
==Riothamus as King Arthur or Ambrosius Aurelianus==
Riothamus has been identified as a candidate for the historical King Arthur by several scholars over the centuries, notably the historian Geoffrey Ashe, primarily due to Riothamus&#x27;s activities in Gaul, which bear a casual resemblance to King Arthur&#x27;s Gallic campaign as first recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his . Geoffrey Ashe has suggested a link between Riothamus&#x27; alleged betrayal by Arvandus and Arthur&#x27;s betrayal by Mordred in the , and proposes that Riothamus&#x27; last known position was near the Burgundian town of Avallon (not noted by any ancient source mentioning Riothamus), which he suggests is the basis for the Arthurian connection to Avalon.

Academic historian Léon Fleuriot argued that Riothamus is identical to Ambrosius Aurelianus, a historical figure in Britain around this time who, in the early narratives containing Arthur, preceded Arthur. Fleuriot suggested that &quot;Riothamus&quot; was Aurelianus&#x27; title as overlord of all Brythonic territories. He noted that &quot;Riothamus&quot; and Aurelianus are contemporaneous and that Aurelianus is the only British leader of the time who is identified (much later) as ruling both Brythons and Franks, which could only be the case if he ruled territory in Brittany. He also suggested that the name &quot;Abros&quot; in Breton genealogies is a contraction of &quot;Ambrosius&quot; and that Nennius indicates that Ambrosius was supreme ruler of the Britons, which, Fleuriot argues, would translate as &quot;Riothamus&quot;. Fleuriot suggested that Ambrosius led the Britons in the battle against the Goths, but then returned to Britain to continue the war against the Saxons.

<doc id="258880" wikidata="Q25761" url="?curid=258880" title="Common shelduck">
<text>The common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) is a waterfowl species of the shelduck genus, &quot;Tadorna&quot;. It is widespread and common in the Euro-Siberian region of the Palearctic, mainly breeding in temperate and wintering in subtropical regions; in winter, it can also be found in the Maghreb.

Fossil bones from Dorkovo (Bulgaria) described as Balcanas pliocaenica may actually belong to this species. More likely, they are an extinct species of &quot;Tadorna&quot; (if not a distinct genus) due to their Early Pliocene age; the present species is not unequivocally attested from the fossil record until some 2–3 million years later (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene).

==Taxonomy==
The common shelduck was formally named by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas tadorna&quot;. Linnaeus largely based his description on &quot;The Sheldrake or Burrough-Duck&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1731 by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin. The specific epithet comes from the French word &quot;Tadorne&quot; for this species, a name that was used by the French naturalist Pierre Belon in 1555. It may originally derive from Celtic roots meaning &quot;pied waterfowl&quot;, essentially the same as the English &quot;shelduck&quot;. Linnaeus specified the locality as Europe but restricted this to Sweden in 1761. The common shelduck is now placed in the genus &quot;Tadorna&quot; that was introduced in 1822 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The common shelduck resembles a small short-necked goose in size and shape. It is a striking bird, with a reddish-pink bill, pink feet, a white body with chestnut patches and a black belly, and a dark green head and neck. The wing coverts are white, the primary remiges black, and the secondaries green (only showing in flight) and chestnut. The underwings are almost entirely white. Sexes are similar, but the female is smaller, with some white facial markings, while the male is particularly crisply coloured in the breeding season, his bill bright red and bearing a prominent knob at the forehead.

Ducklings are white, with black cap, hindneck and wing and back patches. Juveniles are similarly coloured, greyish above and mostly white below, but already have the adult&#x27;s wing pattern.

The call is a loud honk.

==Distribution and habitat==
This is a bird which breeds in temperate Eurosiberia. Most populations migrate to subtropical areas in winter, but this species is largely resident in westernmost Europe, apart from movements to favoured moulting grounds, such as the Wadden Sea on the north German coast.

The common shelduck is common around the coastline of Great Britain and Ireland (where it is known simply as the shelduck), where it frequents salt marshes and estuaries. It frequently nests in rabbit burrows. Sightings of this bird are rare in North America and are reported as infrequent visitors to the U.S. and Canada.

==Behaviour==
Moulting flocks can be very large (100,000 on the Wadden Sea), since most pairs leave their partially grown young in a crèche with just one or two adults.

This species is mainly associated with lakes and rivers in open country, breeding in rabbit burrows, tree holes, haystacks or similar. In winter it is common on suitable estuaries and tidal mudflats as well.

This bird is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

The young will dive under water to avoid predators and the adults will fly away from them to act as a decoy.

<text>The Australian shelduck (Tadorna tadornoides), also known as the chestnut-breasted shelduck or mountain duck, is a shelduck, a group of large goose-like ducks part of the bird family Anatidae. The genus name &quot;Tadorna&quot; comes from Celtic roots and means &quot;pied waterfowl&quot;. They have a striking chestnut-coloured breast and black body. They are protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974.

==Taxonomy and naming==

William Jardine and Prideaux John Selby described the Australian shelduck in 1828.

==Description==
The males are mostly dark, with a chestnut breast. They have white neck collars and dark green heads. The females are similar, but they have white around the eyes and are smaller. Both males and females have chestnut and black wings with a green speculum, and show some white on their wings during flight.

The downy young are white with a brown crown and brown stripes from crown to tail. Juvenile males are duller than the adults and also lack a white collar, while juvenile females have a lot more white on their excluding their crown.

The vocal calls of the male are a deep honk similar to a goose, while the female&#x27;s call is a high pitched and penetrating &quot;zeek, zeek&quot;.

The size range of the Australian Shelduck is , have a wingspan of 94-132cm (37-52in), and weigh between 1.3-1.6 kilograms (2.8-3.5lb). 

==Distribution and habitat==
The Australian shelduck mainly breeds in southern Australia and Tasmania and is still fairly common. In the winter, many birds move farther north than the breeding range. As with other shelducks, this species has favourite moulting grounds, such as Lake George, New South Wales, where sizeable concentrations occur. The Australian shelduck&#x27;s primary habitat is lakes in fairly open country.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Australian Shelducks can be seen in flocks of up to 1000 or more. They are extremely wary of humans and will often call in their presence, but they can get used to people in urban areas. They are upright on land when grazing, and in the water where they sit high. Young birds dive frequently, but adult birds only dive during moulting when they are flightless, or when they are injured or scared.

===Breeding===
Australian Shelducks often make their nests in tree holes lined with down, holes in banks, or similar locations. Eight to fifteen eggs are laid, and incubated for between thirty and thirty-three days. After leaving the nesting hollow, the downy and flightless young often aggregate in crèches of 20-40 birds, and even up to 100 birds rarely.

===Food and Feeding===
Australian Shelducks feed by grazing, dabbling and filtering. They eat tubers and other plant material, such as saltbush and samphire, along with a range of insects, crustaceans and molluscs.

<text>In Germanic mythology, Wayland the Smith (; , ; Old Frisian: Wela(n)du; ; ; &quot;Galans&quot; (&quot;Galant&quot;) in Old French; from &quot;&quot;, lit. &quot;crafting one&quot;) is a master blacksmith originating in Germanic heroic legend, described by Jessie Weston as &quot;the weird and malicious craftsman, Weyland&quot;.

Wayland&#x27;s story is most clearly told in the Old Norse sources &quot;Völundarkviða&quot; (a poem in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;) and &quot;Þiðreks saga&quot;. In them, Wayland is a smith who is enslaved by a king. Wayland takes revenge by killing the king&#x27;s sons and then escapes by crafting a winged cloak and flying away. A number of other visual and textual sources clearly allude to similar stories, most prominently the Old English poem &quot;Deor&quot; and the Franks Casket.

Wayland is also mentioned in passing in a wide range of texts, such as the Old English &quot;Waldere&quot; and &quot;Beowulf&quot;, as the maker of weapons and armour. He is mentioned in the German poems about Theoderic the Great as the father of Witige. He is also attributed to have made various swords for Charlemagne and his paladins, namely Curtana, Durendal and Joyeuse.

== Attestations ==

===Earliest evidence===

The oldest reference known to Wayland the Smith is possibly a gold solidus with a Frisian runic inscription ᚹᛖᛚᚪᛞᚢ wela[n]du &#x27;wayland&#x27;. It is not certain whether the coin depicts the legendary smith or bears the name of a moneyer who happened to be called Wayland (perhaps because he had taken the name of the legendary smith as an epithet). The coin was found near Schweindorf, in the region Ostfriesland in north-west Germany, and is dated AD 575–625.

===Scandinavian===
====Visual====
Wayland&#x27;s legend is depicted on Ardre image stone VIII, and probably on a tenth-century copper mount found in Uppåkra in 2011. A number of other possible visual representations exist in early medieval Scandinavia, but are harder to verify as they do not contain enough distinctive features corresponding to the story of Wayland found in textual sources.

====&quot;Völundarkviða&quot;====
According to &quot;Völundarkviða&quot;, the king of the Finns (the Old Norse term for the Sámi) had three sons: Völundr (Wayland) and his two brothers Egil and Slagfiðr. In one version of the myth, the three brothers lived with three Valkyries: Ölrún, Hervör alvitr and Hlaðguðr svanhvít. After nine years, the Valkyries left their lovers. Egil and Slagfiðr followed, never to return. In another version, Völundr married the swan maiden Hervör, and they had a son, Heime, but Hervör later left Völundr. In both versions, his love left him with a ring. In the former myth, he forged seven hundred duplicates of this ring.

Later, King Niðhad captured Völundr in his sleep in Nerike and ordered him hamstrung and imprisoned on the island of Sævarstöð. There Völundr was forced to forge items for the king. Völundr&#x27;s wife&#x27;s ring was given to the king&#x27;s daughter, Böðvildr. Niðhad wore Völundr&#x27;s sword.

In revenge, Völundr killed the king&#x27;s sons when they visited him in secret, and fashioned goblets from their skulls, jewels from their eyes, and a brooch from their teeth. He sent the goblets to the king, the jewels to the queen and the brooch to the king&#x27;s daughter. When Böðvild takes her ring to Völundr for mending, he tricks and seduces her, and gets her pregnant. Later, he flies to Niðhad&#x27;s hall where he explains how he has murdered the king&#x27;s sons, fashioned jewelry from their bodies and fathered a child with Böðvild. The crying king laments that his archers and horsemen can&#x27;t reach Völundr, as the smith flies away never to be seen again. Niðhad summons his daughter, asking her if Völundr&#x27;s story was true. The poem ends with Böðvild stating that she was unable to protect herself from Völundr as he was too strong for her.

=====&quot;Þiðreks saga&quot;=====

&quot;Þiðreks saga&quot; also includes a version of the story of Wayland (). This part of the saga is sometimes called &quot;Velents þáttr smiðs&quot;.

The events described at King Niðung&#x27;s court (identifiable with Niðhad in the Eddic lay) broadly follow the version in the Poetic Edda (though in the saga his brother, Egil the archer, is present to help him to make his wings and to help Velent escape). However, the rest of the story is different. It tells of how Wayland was the son of a giant named Wade (), and how he was taught to smith by two dwarfs. It also tells of how he came to be with King Niðung, crossing the sea in a hollow log, and how he forged the sword Mimung as part of a bet with the king&#x27;s smith. And it also tells about the argument that led to Niðung&#x27;s hamstringing of Wayland, and ultimately to Wayland&#x27;s revenge: Niðung had promised to give Wayland his daughter in marriage and also half his kingdom, and then went back on this promise.

The saga elaborates on the flying contraption he builds using feathers collected by Egil; the contraption was called the &quot;flygil&quot; which suggests it was a pair of wings () in the original German version, but conceived of as a &quot;fjaðrhamr&quot; (feather cloak) by the saga-writers. Wayland here also wears a blood-filled bladder as a prop, instructing Egil to aim his arrow at this bag, thus feigning injury and deceiving the king.

The saga also tells of the birth of a son, Wideke (), to Wayland and Niðung&#x27;s daughter. While he was still in captivity, the couple have a conversation, and they vow to each other love; the smith also reveals that he has fashioned a weapon and hidden it in the forge for his unborn son. He settles in his native Sjoland and eventually marries the princess with the blessing of her brother who became the next king after Niðung&#x27;s death.

This son inherits the sword Mimung, and goes on to become one of Þidrek/Didrik&#x27;s warriors.

====Other====
In Icelandic manuscripts from the fourteenth century onwards, the terms &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Domus Daedali&quot; (&#x27;home of Daedalus&#x27;) are rendered &quot;Vǫlundarhús&quot; (&#x27;house of Vǫlundr&#x27;). This shows that Völundr was seen as equivalent to, or even identical with, the classical hero Daedalus.

In &quot;Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar&quot;, Völundr is the manufacturer of the magic sword Gram (also named &quot;Balmung&quot; and &quot;Nothung&quot;) and the magic ring that Þorsteinn retrieves.

===English===
====Visual====

The Franks Casket is one of a number of other early English references to Wayland, whose story was evidently well known and popular, although no extended version in Old English has survived. In the front panel of the Franks Casket, incongruously paired with an &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, Wayland stands at the extreme left in the forge where he is held as a slave by King Niðhad, who has had his hamstrings cut to hobble him. Below the forge is the headless body of Niðhad&#x27;s son, whom Wayland has killed, making a goblet from his skull; his head is probably the object held in the tongs in Wayland&#x27;s hand. With his other hand Wayland offers the goblet to Böðvildr, Niðhad&#x27;s daughter. Another female figure is shown in the centre; perhaps Wayland&#x27;s helper, brother Egil, or Böðvildr again. To the right of the scene his brother) catches birds, which he then makes wings from with their feathers, so he is able to escape.

During the Viking Age in northern England, Wayland is depicted in his smithy, surrounded by his tools, at Halton, Lancashire, and fleeing from his royal captor by clinging to a flying bird, on crosses at Leeds, West Yorkshire, and at Sherburn-in-Elmet and Bedale, both in North Yorkshire.

English local tradition placed Wayland&#x27;s forge in a Neolithic long barrow mound known as Wayland&#x27;s Smithy, close to the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire. If a horse to be shod, or any broken tool, were left with a sixpenny piece at the entrance of the barrow the repairs would be executed.

====Textual====

The Old English poem &quot;Deor&quot;, which recounts the famous sufferings of various figures before turning to those of Deor, its author, begins with &quot;Welund&quot;:

:Welund tasted misery among snakes.
:The stout-hearted hero endured troubles
:had sorrow and longing as his companions
:cruelty cold as winter - he often found woe
:Once Nithad laid restraints on him,
:supple sinew-bonds on the better man.
:That went by; so can this.

:To Beadohilde, her brothers&#x27; death was not
:so painful to her heart as her own problem
:which she had readily perceived
:that she was pregnant; nor could she ever
:foresee without fear how things would turn out.
:That went by, so can this.

Weland had fashioned the mail shirt worn by Beowulf according to lines 450–455 of the epic poem of the same name:

:No need then
:to lament for long or lay out my body.
:If the battle takes me, send back
:this breast-webbing that Weland fashioned
:and Hrethel gave me, to Lord Hygelac.
:Fate goes ever as fate must.
:: (Heaney trans.)
The reference in &quot;Waldere&quot; is similar to that in Beowulf – the hero&#x27;s sword was made by Weland – while Alfred the Great in his translation of Boethius asks plaintively: &quot;What now are the bones of Wayland, the goldsmith preeminently wise?&quot;

Swords fashioned by Wayland are regular properties of medieval romance. King Rhydderch Hael gave one to Merlin, and Rimenhild made a similar gift to Child Horn. English literature was also aware of the character Wade, whose name is similar to that of Vaði, the father of Wayland in &quot;Þiðreks saga&quot;.

===Continental Germanic===
Wayland is known by the name &quot;Wieland&quot; in line 965 of the Latin epic &quot;Waltharius&quot;, a literary composition based on Old High German oral tradition, as the smith who made the poem&#x27;s eponymous protagonist&#x27;s armor: 
==Toponyms and folklore==

Wayland is associated with Wayland&#x27;s Smithy, a burial mound in the Berkshire Downs. This was named by the English, but the megalithic mound significantly predates them. It is from this association that the folk belief came about that a horse left there overnight with a small silver coin (groat) would be shod by morning.

This belief is mentioned in the first episode of &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; by Rudyard Kipling, &quot;Weland&#x27;s Sword&quot;, which narrates the rise and fall of the god.

==In modern culture==
Sir Walter Scott includes Wayland Smith as a character in his novel &quot;Kenilworth&quot; set in 1575.

Both the Austrian composer Siegmund von Hausegger (1904) and the Russian composer Leopold van der Pals (1913) used the Wayland saga as inspiration for symphonic poems.

In the ITV Series Robin of Sherwood, Wayland the Smith was credited for creating the Seven Swords that were charged with &quot;the Power of Light and Darkness&quot;. &quot;Morax, Solas, Orias, Albion, Elidor, Beleth, Flauros. On each of them, words of high magic unspoken since they were made. Wayland knew the danger. Oh yes, he knew. That’s why he scattered them, and for hundreds of years they remained apart. Two of them were buried. Others lost in battle, and some so cunningly hidden that none had knowledge of them, except the Cauldron of Lucifer. They knew. The search took many years, many lives. - Morgwyn of Ravenscar&quot; Of the seven, the protagonist Robin of Loxley is gifted Albion by Herne the Hunter at the beginning of the series.

In Gene Wolfe&#x27;s book The Wizard Knight, Weland the smith was the forger of the sword Eterne, which forms a central part of the novel&#x27;s plot.

<doc id="258889" wikidata="Q551912" url="?curid=258889" title="Herbie Mann">
<text>Herbert Jay Solomon (April 16, 1930 – July 1, 2003), known by his stage name Herbie Mann, was an American jazz flute player and important early practitioner of world music. Early in his career, he also played tenor saxophone and clarinet (including bass clarinet), but Mann was among the first jazz musicians to specialize on the flute. His most popular single was &quot;Hi-Jack&quot;, which was a &quot;Billboard&quot; No. 1 dance hit for three weeks in 1975.

Mann emphasized the groove approach in his music. Mann felt that from his repertoire, the &quot;epitome of a groove record&quot; was &quot;Memphis Underground&quot; or &quot;Push Push&quot;, because the &quot;rhythm section locked all in one perception.&quot;

==Early life, family and education==
Herbie Mann was born in Brooklyn, New York, New York, to Jewish parents Harry C. Solomon (May 30, 1902 – May 31, 1980), who was of Russian descent, and Ruth Rose Solomon (née Brecher) (July 4, 1905 – November 11, 2004), of Romanian descent who was born in Bukovina, Austria-Hungary but immigrated to the United States with her family at the age of 6. Both of his parents were dancers and singers, as well as dance instructors later in life.

He attended Lincoln High School in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

==Career==
His first professional performance was playing the Catskills resorts at age 15. In the 1950s Mann was primarily a bop flutist, playing in combos with artists such as Phil Woods, occasionally playing bass clarinet, tenor saxophone and solo flute.

Mann was an early pioneer of the fusion of jazz and world music. In 1959, following a US State Department-sponsored tour of Africa, he recorded &quot;Flautista!&quot;, an album of Afro-Cuban jazz. In 1961, Mann toured Brazil, returning to the US to record with Brazilian musicians, including Antonio Carlos Jobim and guitarist Baden Powell. These albums helped popularize bossa nova in the US and Europe. He often worked with Brazilian themes. In the mid-1960s Mann hired a young Chick Corea to play in some of his bands. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Mann played duets at New York City&#x27;s The Bottom Line and Village Gate clubs, with Sarod virtuoso Vasant Rai.
Following the 1969 hit album &quot;Memphis Underground&quot;, a number of smooth jazz records influenced by Southern soul, blues rock, reggae, funk and disco elicited criticism from jazz purists but allowed Mann to remain active during a period of declining interest in jazz. The musicians on these recordings are some of the best-known session players in soul and jazz, including singer Cissy Houston, guitarists Duane Allman, Larry Coryell, and Sonny Sharrock, bassists Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, Chuck Rainey, and Miroslav Vitous, and drummers Al Jackson, Jr. and Bernard Purdie. In this period Mann had a number of pop hits — rare for a jazz musician. According to a 1998 interview Mann had made at least 25 albums that were on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 pop charts, success denied most of his jazz peers.&quot;

Mann provided the music for the 1978 National Film Board of Canada animated short&quot; Afterlife&quot;, by Ishu Patel.
In the early 1970s, he founded his own label, Embryo Records, distributed by Cotillion Records, a division of Atlantic Records. Embryo produced jazz albums, such as Ron Carter&#x27;s &quot;Uptown Conversation&quot; (1970); Miroslav Vitous&#x27; first solo album, &quot;Infinite Search&quot; (1969); Phil Woods and his European Rhythm Machine at the Frankfurt Jazz Festival (1971); and Dick Morrissey and Jim Mullen&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot; (1976), which featured the Average White Band as a rhythm section; and the 730 Series, with a more rock-oriented style, including &quot;Zero Time&quot; (1971) by TONTO&#x27;s Expanding Head Band. He later set up Kokopelli Records after difficulty with established labels. In 1996, Mann collaborated with Stereolab on the song &quot;One Note Samba/Surfboard&quot; for the AIDS-Benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. Mann also played flutes on the Bee Gees&#x27; album &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot;.

His last appearance was on May 3, 2003, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.

In a review of Mann&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Brooklyn&quot; (2004), his final recording (co-led with Phil Woods), critic George Kanzler proposed that Mann&#x27;s status as an innovator had been overlooked:
:...Mann&#x27;s career, in both its questing nature and embrace of various musical styles, parallels that of Miles Davis. Mann championed Brazilian music even before Stan Getz. When Miles was fusing jazz with rock, Mann was fusing it with Memphis soul and Southern rock. He also was an early exponent of world music. But while Miles was usually hailed as a visionary, Mann was dismissed as just a popularizer selling out. It was a bum rap.

==Personal life and death==
Mann was married to Susan Janeal Arison. His four children are: Paul Mann, Claudia Mann, Laura Mann-Lepik and Geoffrey Mann. Geoff is a multi-instrumentalist who plays drums for Los Angeles-based metal/afrobeat group Here Lies Man.

After a long battle with prostate cancer, Herbie Mann died at age 73 on July 1, 2003, at his home in Pecos, New Mexico.
