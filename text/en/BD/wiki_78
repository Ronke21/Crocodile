<text>Continental Express was the brand name used by a number of independently owned regional airlines providing commuter airliner and regional jet feeder service under agreement with Continental Airlines. In 2010 at the time of Continental&#x27;s merger with United Airlines, two carriers were operating using the Continental Express brand name:

*SkyWest, Inc.&#x27; carrier ExpressJet (206 aircraft, more than 90% of Continental Express flights)
*Republic Airways Holdings&#x27; carrier Chautauqua Airlines (14 aircraft, just under 10% of Continental Express flights)

Continental Express, operated by ExpressJet and Chautauqua, offered service to approximately 150 destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, from Continental&#x27;s hubs in Houston, Newark and Cleveland. ExpressJet operated as a Continental Express and United Express carrier, while Chautauqua also operated flights as Delta Connection, US Airways Express, Frontier Airlines, Midwest Connect, Trans World Express, America West Express, and AmericanConnection. Continental Express operated more flights to Mexico more than any other airline from its hub George Bush Intercontinental Airport.

Following the merger of Continental with United, the &quot;Continental Express&quot; brand was discontinued and such flight services were renamed as [[United Express]].

==History==

Continental Express/ExpressJet was at one time a wholly owned subsidiary of Continental Airlines, Inc. In this previous incarnation before its divestiture various air carriers operating as Continental Express flew turboprop aircraft such as the ATR 42, ATR 72, Beechcraft Model 99, Beechcraft 1900, Convair 580, de Havilland Canada Dash 7, Embraer EMB 110, Embraer EMB 120, Fairchild F-27, Fairchild Metroliner, Grumman Gulfstream I and NAMC YS-11. Continental Express/ExpressJet was formed through the merger of four separate commuter airlines that were wholly owned by Continental: Provincetown-Boston Airlines, of Hyannis, MA, Bar Harbor Airlines, of Bangor, ME, Britt Airways, of Terre Haute, IN, and Rocky Mountain Airways, of Denver, CO. As part of the consolidation of the four commuter operations, the PBA and Rocky Mountain operating certificates were retired. The Bar Harbor certificate went to Eastern Airlines for its Florida Eastern Express division. The combined company that became Continental Express/ExpressJet operated under the Britt Airways operating certificate until November 2011, at which time all ExpressJet operations became part of the Atlantic Southeast Airlines certificate. Continental Express also served Continental&#x27;s Denver and Guam hubs until the early 1990s.

Continental Express was formed in 1986. Since the 1978 deregulation of the U.S. airline industry, U.S. carriers increasingly contracted flying to smaller destinations with small regional carriers; David Messing, a spokesperson with Continental Airlines Holdings in 1991, said that Continental Express was formed because, from a business standpoint, having one subsidiary airline for Continental was preferable to the previous scenario of numerous agreements with various smaller airlines.

In the 1990s the airline was headquartered in the Gateway II office complex near the grounds of Houston Intercontinental Airport in Houston.

On Thursday, September 4, 1997, Continental Express had its first regional jet flight. On Sunday September 7, 1997 Continental Express moved its operations at Bush Intercontinental Airport from Terminal C to Terminal B.

In the past, Trans-Colorado Airlines of Denver, CO, Royale Airlines of Shreveport, LA, Air New Orleans of Birmingham, AL, Mid Pacific Airlines of Honolulu, HI, City Express of Toronto, Ontario, Colgan Airways of Manassas, VA, Southern Jersey Airways of Atlantic City New Jersey, and Gull Air of Hyannis, MA, have operated non-jet aircraft (primarily turboprops) using the Continental Express brand name. Emerald Air of Austin, TX and Royale Airlines also operated Douglas DC-9-10 jet service while Mid Pacific Air operated Fokker F28 jets and Presidential Airways of Herndon, VA flew British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jets on behalf of Continental.

==Continental Connection and Continental Commuter==

Continental Airlines had contracted with other airlines such as Cape Air, of Barnstable, MA, Colgan Air, of Manassas, VA, CommutAir, of South Burlington, VT, GP Express Airlines, of Grand Island, NE, Gulfstream International, of Dania Beach, FL, and SkyWest Airlines, of St. George, UT to operate non-jet aircraft as Continental Connection on short-haul routes beginning in the mid 1990s. The &quot;Continental Connection&quot; brand name was used to identify non-jet, hosted codeshare airlines, while &quot;Continental Express&quot; was used as the marketing name for regional jet and some turboprop hosted codeshare operations. For example, ATR 42, ATR 72 and Embraer EMB 120 propjet flights were operated from the Houston hub as &quot;Continental Express&quot;.

American Eagle Airlines, of Los Angeles, CA also operated turboprop aircraft as a code-share on behalf of Continental Airlines but was not known as Continental Connection.

Pioneer Airlines of Denver, CO and Royale Airlines of Shreveport, LA operated as Continental Commuter carriers from 1983 through 1986 and were the first code-sharing feeder carrier&#x27;s on behalf of Continental Airlines. Pioneer was the feeder at Continental&#x27;s Denver hub but ceased operations in mid-1986. Royale was the feeder at the Houston hub utilizing Douglas DC-9-10 jets as well as Grumman Gulfstream I propjets in addition to other commuter turboprop aircraft types and was reclassified as Continental Express by the fall of 1986.

==Other subsidiary airline operations==
Two additional airlines worthy of note, which operated in connection with Continental Airlines, were New York Air and Continental West, of Los Angeles, both of which operated mainline jet aircraft. New York Air began operations in 1980 between Boston, New York/LaGuardia, and Washington/National, flying McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 and MD-80 jetliners, while Continental West – in a sense a predecessor of CALite – started in 1985, operating an hourly shuttle between Los Angeles and San Jose with Boeing 737-300 jets. Both airlines were started by Continental&#x27;s holding company, Texas Air, in an effort to operate low cost flights, and both were folded into Continental in 1986. In addition, a third independent air carrier, Emerald Air of Austin, TX, operated the &quot;Houston Proud Express&quot; Douglas DC-9-10 jet shuttle service on a short, crosstown route between Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) in the mid 1980s.

==Operators and fleet==
===Fleet===
ExpressJet Holdings announced on December 28, 2005, that it received notice from Continental Airlines of its intention to reduce by 69 the number of aircraft ExpressJet will operate for Continental under the companies&#x27; capacity purchase agreement. Per the agreement, ExpressJet could return the aircraft to Continental, or lease them from Continental at a higher rate and operate as a regional feeder for another airline.

As announced by Continental, the withdrawal of aircraft from the agreement was expected to begin in January 2007 and be completed during summer 2007. Simultaneously, Continental announced its intention to request proposals from other regional carriers to lease and operate the returned aircraft, beginning in January 2007. Continental announced in April 2006 that Chautauqua Airlines had been awarded a contract to operate the 69 aircraft owned by Continental.

ExpressJet later announced its intention to operate the 69 aircraft independently, at increased lease rates. As a result, Chautauqua was forced to add a new fleet type.

In July 2006, Continental Airlines announced a new contract, in which Chautauqua Airlines would provide and operate regional jets as a Continental Express carrier. As of 2009, Continental Express consisted of 214 aircraft operated by ExpressJet Airlines, and 20 aircraft operated by Chautauqua Airlines. All Express flights were then operated with regional jet aircraft; however Continental Connection flights were operated with prop aircraft configured with as few as nine seats.

By 2008 however, ExpressJet then decided to end all of its independent flying and operate all flights once again as a Continental Express carrier until November 30, 2011.

===Historical regional jet fleet===
The Continental Express brand, through its various regional and commuter airline partners, operated a variety of twinjet aircraft over the years including the following types:

* BAe 146-200
* Bombardier CRJ200

===Historical turboprop fleet===
The Continental Express brand, through its various regional and commuter airline partners, operated a variety of twin turboprop aircraft over the years including the following types:

* ATR 42
* ATR 72
* Beechcraft Model 99
* Beechcraft 1900C
* Beechcraft 1900D
* Convair 580
* de Havilland Canada Dash 7

==Accidents and incidents==
*On May 26, 1987, Air New Orleans Flight 2962, operating under the Continental Express brand name with a British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 commuter propjet (Registration N331CY), crash-landed just after takeoff from New Orleans International Airport. The plane crashed into eight lanes of traffic on U.S. 61 adjacent to the airfield and subsequently injured two persons on the ground. Of the 11 occupants on board, there were zero fatalities. The cause of the crash was attributed to pilot error, including failing to follow checklists.
*On January 19, 1988, Trans-Colorado Airlines Flight 2286, a Fairchild Metro III operated under the Continental Express brand, crashed near Bayfield, Colorado. Both crew members and 7 of 15 passengers died. Of the surviving passengers one received major injuries and six received minor injuries, and one received no injuries.
*On September 11, 1991, Continental Express Flight 2574, flown by Britt Airways, was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Laredo International Airport in Laredo, Texas to Houston Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas. The Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia crashed as it was descending towards Houston, killing all 14 people on board. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that an improperly-maintained horizontal stabilizer failed during approach, causing a severe nose-down pitchover and breakup of the plane.
* On January 21, 1998, a Continental Express ATR-42, N15827, had an emergency during roll on landing. During the landing roll, a fire erupted in the right engine. The airplane was stopped on the runway, the engines were shut down and the occupants evacuated. The fire handles for both engines were pulled and both fire bottles on the right engine discharged. However, the fire in the right engine continued to burn. The airport fire services attended shortly afterward and extinguished the fire.
*On July 28, 1999, , an ATR 42 (also flown by Britt Airways), had just landed at Little Rock National Airport and was taxiing to the ramp when the station manager was struck by the propeller of the left engine and killed.

<doc id="266946" wikidata="Q1857178" url="?curid=266946" title="Richmond International Airport">
<text>Richmond International Airport is a joint civil-military airport in Sandston, Virginia, United States, an unincorporated community (in Henrico County). The airport is about 7 miles (11 km) southeast of downtown Richmond, the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Richmond International Airport is the busiest airport in central Virginia and the third-busiest in the state behind Washington Reagan and Washington Dulles. RIC covers 2,500 acres (1,012 ha) of land.

==Overview==
The Capital Region Airport Commission (CRAC) owns and operates Richmond International Airport. Established in 1975 by the Virginia General Assembly, the commission is overseen by representatives of the counties of Chesterfield, Hanover, and Henrico, and the City of Richmond. RIC serves the Greater Richmond Region with non-stop flights to 26 destinations, served by seven air carriers. A joint civil-military public airport, RIC encompasses the former property of the Richmond International Airport Air National Guard Station, which was transferred to the Department of the Army in support of U.S. Army Reserves and Virginia Army National Guard Activities.

In the early 2000s, Richmond saw another period of extensive growth, and in 2005 it announced a complete redesign. RIC went from a single story terminal with 12 gates to 22 gates (plus numerous non-jet bridge gates), added parking spaces (to 10,500), and created a new terminal roadway and air traffic control tower. The project features major renovations of the terminal building, including upper-level departures and lower-level arrivals, the construction of a central utility plant, and the widening of security checkpoints. Construction on the two-level terminal was completed in spring 2007, and was designed by Gresham, Smith &amp; Partners. Due to passenger growth, Richmond reopened its international gate (B15) for flights to Cancun, Toronto and Punta Cana, all of which are seasonal services.

In 2016, Richmond recorded its second highest yearly passenger volume, and the airport had a major expansion begun in late 2018. The number of gates increased from 22 to 28 or 30 by adding 6 or 8 gates (net) to its A Concourse. Construction commenced in late 2018 and lasted for 3 years. The expansion was completed in 2021.

The airport also expanded the checkpoint area in Concourse B, from four to six TSA screening lanes. The TSA lane expansion commenced in the fall of 2018 and was completed in June 2019. Concourse A has three screening lanes in its checkpoint area, though that is likely to be expanded in the next few years. More construction at the airport is coming - the Capital Region Airport Commission is looking into moving the rental car counters from the central portion of the lower lobby level to an expanded north baggage claim area. The airport also expects to add an enclosed two-level connecting walkway between the terminal and the rental car garage. The rental car garage is also set to expand. In November 2024, the Commission announced an official plan to consolidate the TSA security checkpoints into one central location, made possible by a $2.5 million FAA grant. The number of lanes is not finalized yet, but the construction and updates is expected to begin in late 2026. 

In 2016, Richmond International Airport handled over 63,000 tons of cargo, an all-time high. Cargo services include more than of warehouse/office space and of apron space. The airport is designated a Foreign Trade Zone. Because of its position on the Eastern Seaboard, cargo transit via RIC is on the rise. Goods shipped out of the metropolitan Richmond area can reach 72% of the U.S. population within 24 hours.

In 2016, RIC reported its 32nd consecutive month of growth, with an estimated 345,000 travelers reported in October 2016. Several airlines serving RIC have responded to growing demand with upgraded routes and aircraft. Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines added additional routes and larger aircraft in 2017. United Airlines up-gauged its Denver service to a mainline aircraft, replacing the Embraer E-175 used with United Express.

In 2017, the airport served 3,657,479 passengers, a record for the airport at that time, breaking its previous record of 3,634,544 in 2007. In 2023, RIC set an all-time passenger record of 4,755,889. RIC is served by airlines flying primarily domestic routes to cities in the South, Northeast and Midwest, and connecting flights to major hubs for international destinations.

==History==

The airport was dedicated as Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field in 1927 in honor of aviator Richard E. Byrd, brother of then Gov. Harry F. Byrd. Charles Lindbergh attended the dedication ceremony. Although the facility was in Henrico County, Richmond Mayor John Fulmer Bright was instrumental in the creation of Byrd Field, which was initially owned by the City of Richmond. It was renamed Richard E. Byrd Airport in 1950, and became Richmond International Airport in 1984. The airport&#x27;s manager from 1957 to 1988 was Anthony E. Dowd, Sr.

A terminal building designed by Marcellus Wright and Son was completed in 1950. It was expanded from 1968 to 1970, which included the current passenger concourses.

The April 1957 Official Airline Guide lists 43 weekday departures: 22 on Eastern Air Lines, ten on Piedmont Airlines, five on American Airlines, four on National Airlines and two on Capital Airlines.

In the mid-1970s United Airlines scheduled a daily round trip between Richmond and Los Angeles (LAX) with a Douglas DC-8-61 via Washington–Dulles. The DC-8-61 was most likely the largest passenger airliner ever scheduled to the airport. United was also flying Boeing 727-200s and Boeing 737-200s to the airport, including nonstop flights to Washington–National in addition to Dulles. Other airlines at Richmond in 1975 included Eastern Air Lines operating Boeing 727s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s with nonstops from Atlanta, New York–JFK, New York–LaGuardia and Raleigh/Durham; and Piedmont Airlines operating Boeing 737-200s and NAMC YS-11s nonstop from Charleston (WV), Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, Huntington, Lynchburg (VA), Newport News, Norfolk, Raleigh/Durham, Roanoke, Rocky Mount/Wilson, and Washington–National. Altair Airlines, a commuter air carrier, was serving Richmond with Beechcraft 99s nonstop from Baltimore, Philadelphia and Wilmington, DE.

The February 15, 1985 OAG listed five airlines serving Richmond with jet aircraft including Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines, United Airlines and USAir. Delta was operating Boeing 737-200s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop from Atlanta; Eastern was operating Boeing 727-100s, McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50s nonstop from Atlanta, Charlotte, Greensboro, New York–JFK and New York–LaGuardia; Piedmont was operating Boeing 727-200s, Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F28 Fellowships nonstop from Baltimore, Charlotte, Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, Greensboro, Kinston (NC), Louisville, New York–LaGuardia, Norfolk and Philadelphia, United was operating Boeing 727-100 and Boeing 727-200 nonstop from Baltimore, Chicago–O&#x27;Hare and Norfolk, and USAir was operating BAC One-Elevens and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Four commuter and regional airlines were at Richmond, including Air Virginia which was operating a hub at the airport flying Swearingen Metroliners nonstop from Baltimore, Charlottesville (VA), Lynchburg (VA), New Bern (NC), Newport News, New York–LaGuardia, Newark, Norfolk, Philadelphia, Raleigh/Durham, Roanoke, and Washington–National; Delta Connection operated by Comair with nonstop Saab 340s and Swearingen Metroliners operated on a code sharing basis for Delta from Roanoke; Piedmont Regional Airlines operating Beechcraft 99, de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 and Short 330 turboprops with nonstop service flown on a code sharing basis for Piedmont from Baltimore, Newport News, Norfolk and Roanoke; and Wheeler Airlines operating Beechcraft 99 turboprops nonstop from Danville (VA), Raleigh/Durham, Washington–National and Wilmington (DE). By 1986 Wheeler Airlines had a small hub at the airport and had added nonstop flights from Charleston (WV) and Parkersburg (WV).

==Accidents and incidents==

*On May 16, 1946, a Douglas C-47 operated by Viking Air Transport crashed 6.3 miles south of Richmond-Byrd Field due to engine issues. All 27 on board were killed.
*On July 19, 1951: Eastern Airlines Flight 601 bound from Newark to Miami suffered severe buffeting after an access door opened in flight over Lynchburg, Virginia and the crew decided to divert to Richmond. A flapless wheels-up landing was made a few miles short of the runway at Curles Neck Farm because the crew feared that the aircraft would disintegrate before they could get to the airport to attempt an emergency landing. There were no fatalities.
*On November 8, 1961: Imperial Airlines Flight 201/8 was destroyed when it crashed and burned following an attempted emergency landing at the airport, all 74 passengers, and three of the five crew members died.
*On July 16, 1964: An Eastern Airlines DC-7B N809D with 76 occupants bound from New York touched down short of Runway 15, suffered a right main gear collapse and slid for 4752 feet. There were no injuries, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*On May 6, 1980, a Gates Learjet 23, N866JS, rolled inverted landing on Runway 33. The aircraft crashed adjacent to the runway at 03:12 and burst into flame. Both pilots were killed.
*On June 9, 1996, Eastwind Airlines Flight 517 from Trenton, New Jersey, experienced loss of rudder control while on approach to Richmond; however, control was regained shortly after, and the aircraft landed normally. There was one minor injury.

== Military ==

=== Virginia Army National Guard ===

Richmond International Airport serves as an Aviation Support Facility for the Virginia Army National Guard 224th Aviation Regiment. The Army National Guard currently has 25 helicopters including 18 UH-60&#x27;s, 3 HH-60&#x27;s, and 4 UH-72&#x27;s based at the facility. The facility also has 1 C-12 Huron which serves a cargo/passenger transport role.

=== Virginia Air National Guard ===
Until October 2007, the 192d Fighter Wing (192 FW), an Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained unit of the Virginia Air National Guard, maintained an Air National Guard station, operating F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft from the airport. In late 2007, pursuant to BRAC 2005 action, the 192 FW relinquished its F-16C and F-16D aircraft and moved to Langley AFB (now Joint Base Langley-Eustis), to integrate with the Regular Air Force as an associate unit to the 1st Fighter Wing (1 FW) flying the F-22 Raptor.

<doc id="266950" wikidata="Q2911538" url="?curid=266950" title="Galileo's ship">
<text>Galileo&#x27;s ship refers to two physics experiments, a thought experiment and an actual experiment, by Galileo Galilei, the 16th- and 17th-century physicist and astronomer. The experiments were created to argue the idea of a rotating Earth as opposed to a stationary Earth around which rotated the Sun, planets, and stars.

An argument that was used at the time was that if Earth were rotating, there would be detectable effects on the trajectories of projectiles or falling bodies.

==Ship&#x27;s mast experiment==

In 1616, after Galileo had already become concerned that he was a target of suspicion by the Inquisition, he received a letter from Monsignor Francesco Ingoli listing both scientific and theological arguments against Copernicanism. As part of a lengthy 1624 reply, Galileo described the experiment of dropping a rock from the mast of a smoothly moving ship and observing whether the rock hit at the base of the mast or behind it. Various people had discussed the experiment in theoretical terms, and some claimed to have done it, with conflicting reports as to the result. For example, actual or thought experiments similar to this one had been previously discussed by Jean Buridan, Nicolas Oresme, Nicolaus Cusanus, Clavius and Giordano Bruno.

Galileo told Ingoli (translated by Stillman Drake):

I have been twice as good a philosopher as those others because they, in saying what is the opposite of the effect, have also added the lie of their having seen this by experiment; and I have made the experiment—before which, physical reasoning had persuaded me that the effect must turn out as it indeed does.

Galileo also discussed the experiment in his &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot; (day 2),
 but without any assertion that it was actually carried out. A similar experiment discussed by Galileo and other authors such as Oresme, Clavius and Bruno is one in which a projectile is launched straight up from the surface of the earth. A common Aristotelian-Scholastic argument was that if the earth&#x27;s surface were moving to the east, then in this experiment the projectile would land to the west of the launching point, contrary to observation.

==1632 thought experiment==
Galileo&#x27;s 1632 book &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot; considered (the Second Day) all the common arguments then current against the idea that the Earth moves. One of these is that if the Earth were spinning on its axis, then we would all be moving to the East at thousands of kilometres per hour so a ball dropped straight down from a tower would land West of the tower which would have moved some distance East in the interim. Similarly, the argument went, a cannonball fired to the East would land closer to the cannon than one fired to the West because the cannon moving East would partly catch up with the ball. To counter such arguments the book observes that a person on a uniformly moving ship has no sense of movement and so a cannonball dropped from the top of the mast would fall directly to the foot. To prove the point Galileo&#x27;s fictional advocate Salviati proposed the experiment described below to show the classical principle of relativity according to which there is no internal observation (i.e. without, as it were, looking out the window) by which one can distinguish between a system moving uniformly from one at rest. Hence, any two systems moving without acceleration are equivalent, and unaccelerated motion is relative. Nearly three centuries later, this notion was applied to the laws of electricity and magnetism (Maxwell&#x27;s equations) by Albert Einstein. This led to the formulation of the special theory of relativity, a restatement of Galileo&#x27;s argument with the then-known laws of gravitation and electromagnetism taken into account.

===The proposal===
Salviati&#x27;s experiment goes as follows:
Shut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some large ship, and have with you there some flies, butterflies, and other small flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish in it; hang up a bottle that empties drop by drop into a wide vessel beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the little animals fly with equal speed to all sides of the cabin. The fish swim indifferently in all directions; the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something to your friend, you need to throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the distances being equal; jumping with your feet together, you pass equal spaces in every direction. When you have observed all these things carefully (though doubtless when the ship is standing still everything must happen in this way), have the ship proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion is uniform and not fluctuating this way and that. You will discover not the least change in all the effects named, nor could you tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still. In jumping, you will pass on the floor the same spaces as before, nor will you make larger jumps toward the stern than toward the prow even though the ship is moving quite rapidly, despite the fact that during the time that you are in the air the floor under you will be going in a direction opposite to your jump. In throwing something to your companion, you will need no more force to get it to him whether he is in the direction of the bow or the stern, with yourself situated opposite. The droplets will fall as before into the vessel beneath without dropping toward the stern, although while the drops are in the air the ship runs many spans. The fish in their water will swim toward the front of their bowl with no more effort than toward the back, and will go with equal ease to bait placed anywhere around the edges of the bowl. Finally the butterflies and flies will continue their flights indifferently toward every side, nor will it ever happen that they are concentrated toward the stern, as if tired out from keeping up with the course of the ship, from which they will have been separated during long intervals by keeping themselves in the air. And if smoke is made by burning some incense, it will be seen going up in the form of a little cloud, remaining still and moving no more toward one side than the other. The cause of all these correspondences of effects is the fact that the ship&#x27;s motion is common to all the things contained in it, and to the air also. That is why I said you should be below decks; for if this took place above in the open air, which would not follow the course of the ship, more or less noticeable differences would be seen in some of the effects noted.

<text>Leonard Bocour (March 18, 1910 – September 6, 1993) was an American artist.

Bocour was born in New York City. Around 1933, he formed the New York City based company Bocour Artists Colors. He was the co-developer along with Sam Golden of Magna paint in the late 1940s. From 1952 until 1970, he and Sam Golden were partners in the Bocour Artists Colors Co. The company sold artist paints from the late 1930s until the 1990s. Many well-known artists from Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning to Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Knox Martin, Kenneth Noland, and hundreds of others bought paint from Leonard Bocour. The tubes of paint marked &quot;Bocour&quot; were watercolor or oil paint and the tubes labeled &quot;Bellini&quot; were oil paint. The acrylic paint was thick bodied and called &quot;Aquatec&quot;.

He was a serious art collector, in addition to being a well-known paint manufacturer. He collected and owned works by many of his now famous customers. Bocour donated part of his collection to St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland.

<doc id="266955" wikidata="Q1192962" url="?curid=266955" title="Raleigh–Durham International Airport">
<text>Raleigh–Durham International Airport , locally known by its IATA code RDU, is an international airport that serves Raleigh, Durham, and the surrounding Research Triangle region of North Carolina as its main airport. It is located in unincorporated Wake County, but is surrounded by the city of Raleigh to the north and east, and the towns of Cary and Morrisville to the south. The airport covers and has three runways.

As of 2025, RDU ranks 35th in passenger arrivals and departures in the US, offering passenger service to over 75 destinations, including 14 international destinations in ten countries. There are more than 400 average daily flights. The RDU Airport Authority is in charge of the airport facilities and operations and is controlled by a board of representatives from the counties of Wake and Durham and the cities of Raleigh and Durham.

Raleigh–Durham International Airport is the second-largest airport in the state of North Carolina, behind Charlotte Douglas International Airport. The main catchment area is central &amp; eastern North Carolina, and southern Virginia. The airport is an operating base for Avelo Airlines and Endeavor Air, as well as a focus city for Delta Air Lines.

In 2024, RDU served a record 15.5 million passengers, which broke the airport&#x27;s record of 14.5 million passengers set in 2023.

==History==
===Founding===

The region&#x27;s first airport opened in 1929 as Raleigh Municipal Airport, south of Raleigh. It was quickly outgrown, and in 1939 the North Carolina General Assembly chartered the Raleigh–Durham Aeronautical Authority to build and operate a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham. This was promoted by Eastern Air Lines, led by then chairman Eddie Rickenbacker, who wanted to make RDU a stop on the airline&#x27;s New York–Miami route.

The new Raleigh–Durham Airport opened on May 1, 1943, with flights by Eastern Airlines. The passenger terminal was built from materials remaining after the construction of four barracks for the Army Air Forces Air Technical Service Command airfield. The three runways the airport had in 1951 are still visible on the southeast side of the airport: 4500-ft runway 5, 4500-ft runway 18 and 4490-ft runway 14.

After World War II, Capital Airlines joined Eastern at RDU; Piedmont Airlines arrived in 1948. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 36 departures a day: twenty Eastern, eight Capital and eight Piedmont. Nonstop flights did not reach beyond Washington, Atlanta, or the Appalachians (but Eastern started a Super Constellation nonstop to Newark in 1958). The next airline (aside from United&#x27;s takeover of Capital in 1961) was Delta Air Lines in 1970. In April 1969, nonstops didn&#x27;t reach beyond New York or Atlanta, and Chicago was the only nonstop west of the Appalachians. RDU&#x27;s first scheduled jets were Eastern 727s in 1965.

In the 1970s, the last decade before airline deregulation, Piedmont connected RDU to Charlotte, Greensboro, New Bern, Norfolk, Richmond, Rocky Mount, Washington, Wilmington and Winston-Salem. United flew to Asheville, Charlotte, Huntsville and Newark, while Eastern flew to Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and Washington, and Delta flew to Chicago and Greensboro.

After deregulation, Allegheny Airlines arrived in 1979, and by 1985 Trans World Airlines, American Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, People Express, New York Air and Pan Am had all put in appearances.

===Hub years===
American built a terminal at RDU between 1985 and 1987 to house a new hub, and flew to 38 cities when the hub started in June 1987. The December 1987 timetable shows AA nonstops to 36 airports and American Eagle prop nonstops to 18 more. American later flew to London-Gatwick and Paris-Orly. The RDU hub operated at a loss even during its heyday in the early 1990s, like the hub AA had at Nashville. American&#x27;s December 1992 timetable, around the time of the hub&#x27;s peak, showed 211 daily departures to 64 destinations, almost all in the eastern United States (the westernmost destinations being American&#x27;s hubs at Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago–O&#x27;Hare). The hub faced intense competition from Delta and Eastern in Atlanta, Northwest in Memphis, and from USAir in Charlotte, as well as the short-lived Continental hub in Greensboro that opened in 1993. American began to consider closing the hub in late 1993; operations were reduced until June 1995 when American closed the hub. In 1996, Air Canada became the airport&#x27;s first international carrier with service to Toronto.

American retained a daily nonstop flight to London, which continued to operate until the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed in 2022. The RDU-London route was originally launched based on a purchasing commitment from GlaxoSmithKline, which has major offices at both ends of the route; the route is no longer dependent on GSK for revenue.

Midway Airlines replaced AA as the airport&#x27;s hub carrier from 1995 until 2003. In 1995, Midway had flights to Boston, Hartford, Long Island, Newark, Newburgh, New York, Philadelphia and Washington in the Northeast, and to Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach in Florida. American subleased its gates at RDU to Midway in order to repay $113 million in American-guaranteed bonds that had been used to construct the hub facilities. Midway suspended service for some time after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and ceased operations in 2002, filing for bankruptcy in 2003.

===Recent history===

RDU&#x27;s post-hub years have brought the addition of new carriers and destinations, notably
discount carriers such as Allegiant Air, Southwest Airlines and Frontier Airlines. Because of the economic downturn and high fuel prices in 2008, American ended most point to point flights it operated out of the airport. Several mainline flights were also dropped and service to other cities was reduced or downgraded. Other airlines also cut flights and destinations including United Airlines and US Airways. Also in 2008, the airport was modernized; the current rebuilt Terminal 2 opened, on the site of the old Terminal C that was built in 1987. The rebuilt was completed in 2011, and was designed by Fentress Architects.

By 2010, RDU&#x27;s traffic began to recover. In the first few months of the year, passenger numbers stabilized at RDU, ending the decrease the airport experienced in 2008 and 2009. In the first four months of 2010, 2.7 million passengers traveled through RDU. Growth was flat compared to the same period a year before, but these signs were positive indicating that the decline was over. Airlines at RDU began to add new services to the schedule with both legacy and low-cost carriers significantly increasing service since the early 2010s.

Delta Air Lines maintains a focus city operation at RDU, which it decided to maintain in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the area&#x27;s strong economy and lack of a dominant network carrier.

In November 2022, Avelo Airlines announced the opening of an operating base at Raleigh-Durham. Service started on February 15, 2023. Avelo currently operates two aircraft and around 90 employees at the airport.

Endeavor Air, a regional airline for Delta, plan to open a new crew base in the summer of 2025, with expected 130 to 170 employees.

===Future===
The Vision 2040 Master Plan details several major improvements that are aimed to be made by 2040. Proposed in 2017 by the RDU Airport Authority, the plan calls for major additions and renovations of current facilities at the airport. This includes the construction of a consolidated rental car facility, an on-site hotel, expansion of parking lots, expansion of both terminals, improvements to the taxiway layout, and the replacement of both runways. The proposal included lengthening runway 5R/23L to and rebuilding runway 5L/23R to a length of just northwest of its current position. The existing runway 5L/23R will become a taxiway for the new runway. After modifying the planned runway length multiple times, the FAA authorized the construction of the new runway on September 5, 2023. The construction of RDU&#x27;s new 5L/23R runway began on October 11, 2023. The new runway will be built at a length of and is anticipated to be finished in 5 years.

In June 2023, the Airport Authority Board approved an agreement to advance the planning process for terminal 1 expansion to allow for future growth as RDU reached new passenger traffic records and destinations served. RDU is also planning on expanding their customs and border patrol center to accommodate for the increase of international flights at RDU.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===

The airport contains two terminals with a total of 45 gates. The two terminals do not have an airside connection; passengers moving between the terminals may ride a shuttle bus or take the moving walkway through covered parking decks between the terminals. All non precleared international flights are processed in Terminal 2 and arrive into gates C21, C23, C24 and C25.
* Terminal 1 contains 9 gates, A1–A9. The Vision2040 plan proposes the addition of 4, 7, 12 or 15 gates. The terminal is used by Alaska Airlines, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines. In 2024, RDU moved three airlines in Terminal 2 to maximize check-in, gate space, and overall terminal space for airlines at Terminal 2.
* Terminal 2 contains 36 gates, with concourses C and D. This is the only terminal at RDU that hosts international arrivals, utilizing gates C21 and C23–C25. Aeroméxico Connect, Air Canada, Air France, American Airlines, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Icelandair, JetBlue, Lufthansa and United fly from Terminal 2. American Airlines Admirals Club, Delta Air Lines Sky Club, United Club, and USO of North Carolina are all located in this terminal.

===Cargo areas===
The airport incorporates two cargo areas, North Cargo and South Cargo. The North Cargo terminal area is used by cargo airlines. The largest cargo operators are FedEx and UPS. The South Cargo terminal area is used by commercial airlines for cargo operations.

===Maintenance base===
Endeavor Air built a maintenance base in 2019. The primary function is line maintenance. No hangar is available for maintenance.

===Lounges===
United Airlines has a United Club in Terminal 2, across from gates D1-D3, Delta Air Lines has a Delta Sky Club in Terminal 2, across from gate C3, and American Airlines has an Admirals Club in Terminal 2, also across from gate C3.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On January 2, 1953, a USAF Douglas C-47 crashed near RDU attempting to land with rain and low visibility after diverting from Pope AFB in Fayetteville. The aircraft crashed nearly two miles south of the airport in Crabtree Park. Three out of the four occupants died.
* On Wednesday, November 12, 1975, Eastern Air Lines Flight 576, a Boeing 727-225, crashed while attempting to land on runway 23 (now runway 23 Left). The aircraft hit the ground short of the runway and bounced back into the air before coming down on the runway and sliding down the runway, stopping where the south end of Terminal 1 is today. Of the 139 persons on the flight, eight were injured, one seriously. The NTSB investigation initially blamed the crash on &quot;the pilot&#x27;s failure to execute a missed approach when he lost sight of the runway environment in heavy rain below decision height.&quot; The accident report and probable cause were later revised to include the influence of undetected wind shear. The aircraft (Boeing 727-225, N8838E) sustained major damage and was moved to an area on the north end of closed runway 18. A temporary structure was built around the aircraft, which was eventually repaired and returned to service.
* On December 31, 1986, a passenger aboard United Airlines Flight 1502 was wounded after a local hunter fired his rifle from the ground into the airframe of the landing aircraft. Robert Raymond Proulx, fired a bullet through the fuselage wounding a passenger (Barry Rollins) in the thigh and the cheek as the projectile ricocheted inside the cabin.
* On February 19, 1988, AVAir Flight 3378, a Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner was on a regularly scheduled flight between Raleigh and Richmond operating for American Eagle when it crashed into a reservoir about a mile from the airport in the vicinity of Cary. The aircraft had departed during low ceiling, low visibility and night conditions. Analysis of radar data indicated the aircraft was in a 45-degree descending turn. Both crew members and all 10 passengers were killed. It was revealed during the investigation that the pilot had complained of illness but decided to continue the flight.
* On December 13, 1994, American Eagle Flight 3379 operated by AMR&#x27;s regional airline Flagship Airlines, a Jetstream 31 was on a regularly scheduled service of Raleigh–Greensboro–Raleigh when it crashed into a wooded area about SW of the airport, in the vicinity of Morrisville. Of the 20 onboard (18 passengers and two crewmembers) 15 were killed while the five survivors received serious injuries. The probable cause of the crash was the pilot not following proper procedure when it came to an engine failure situation.
* On July 31, 2000, a Win Win Aviation de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter crashed on approach nearly two miles SSW of RDU on a positioning flight due to fog and darkness. The pilot was not instrument rated to fly in bad weather. One crewmember out of the three occupants died.
* On October 20, 2019, a Piper PA-32 crashed in a wooded area of Umstead State Park on approach to runway 32. Both occupants of the plane died.
* On July 29, 2022, a CASA C-212 Aviocar from Raeford West Airport made an emergency landing and subsequently slid off runway 23L due to its lack of right landing gear. On approach, the 23-year old co-pilot, Charles Hew Crooks, exited the plane over Fuquay-Varina and subsequently died. The pilot was transported to the hospital with minor injuries as the result of a rough landing.
* On April 25, 2024, a Socata TBM 850 from Wilmington operated by UNC Air Operations crashed during landing on runway 32. Both the pilot and the sole onboard passenger were injured.

<doc id="266956" wikidata="Q1412640" url="?curid=266956" title="Conflict theories">
<text>Conflict theories are perspectives in political philosophy and sociology which argue that individuals and groups (social classes) within society interact on the basis of conflict rather than agreement, while also emphasizing social psychology, historical materialism, power dynamics, and their roles in creating power structures, social movements, and social arrangements within a society. Conflict theories often draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, or a conflict continuum. Power generally contrasts historically dominant ideologies, economies, currencies or technologies. Accordingly, conflict theories represent attempts at the macro-level analysis of society.

Many political philosophers and sociologists have been framed as having conflict theories, dating back as far as Plato&#x27;s idea of the tripartite soul of The Republic, to Hobbes&#x27; ideas in The Leviathan. Other historical political philosophers associated with having &quot;conflict theories&quot; include Jean Bodin, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Robert Malthus, Karl Marx, and Georg Simmel. Georg Simmel was one of the earliest sociologists to formally use &quot;conflict&quot; as a framework to understand social change, writing about the topic in his 1908 book, &quot;Conflict and the Web of Group Affiliations&quot;.

While many conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought, conflict theory &quot;does not&quot; refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, social conflict theory, or any other specific theory related to social conflict.

== In classical conflict theory ==

Two early conflict theorists were the Polish-Austrian sociologist and political theorist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838–1909) and the American sociologist and paleontologist Lester F. Ward (1841–1913). Although Ward and Gumplowicz developed their theories independently they had much in common and approached conflict from a comprehensive anthropological and evolutionary point-of-view as opposed to Marx&#x27;s rather exclusive focus on economic factors.

Gumplowicz, in &quot;Grundriss der Soziologie&quot; (&quot;Outlines of Sociology&quot;, 1884), describes how civilization has been shaped by conflict between cultures and ethnic groups. Gumplowicz theorized that large complex human societies evolved from war and conquest. The winner of a war would enslave the losers; eventually a complex caste system develops. Horowitz says that Gumplowicz understood conflict in all its forms: &quot;class conflict, race conflict, and ethnic conflict&quot;, and calls him one of the fathers of conflict theory.

Conflict theories were popular in early sociology, and accordingly often date back to the early 1900s founders of Sociology, and particularly the ideas of Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, Karl Marx, and Lester Frank Ward.

Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) saw society as a functioning organism. Functionalism concerns &quot;the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system,&quot; The chief form of social conflict that Durkheim addressed was crime. Durkheim saw crime as &quot;a factor in public health, an integral part of all healthy societies.&quot; The collective conscience defines certain acts as &quot;criminal.&quot; Crime thus plays a role in the evolution of morality and law: &quot;[it] implies not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes.&quot;

Max Weber&#x27;s (1864–1920) approach to conflict is contrasted with that of Marx. While Marx focused on the way individual behavior is conditioned by social structure, Weber emphasized the importance of &quot;social action,&quot; i.e., the ability of individuals to affect their social relationships.

Karl Marx (1818–1883) based his conflict theory on a dialectical materialist account of history, Marxism posited that capitalism, like previous socioeconomic systems, would inevitably produce internal tensions leading to its own destruction. Marx ushered in radical change, advocating proletarian revolution and freedom from the ruling classes, as well as critiqued political economy. At the same time, Karl Marx was aware that most of the people living in capitalist societies did not see how the system shaped the entire operation of society. Just as modern individuals see private property (and the right to pass that property on to their children) as natural, many of the members in capitalistic societies see the rich as having earned their wealth through hard work and education, while seeing the poor as lacking in skill and initiative. Marx rejected this type of thinking, viewing it as something Friedrich Engels termed &quot;false consciousness&quot;, the use of misdirection by the ruling class to obfuscate the exploitation intrinsic to the relationship between the proletariat and the ruling class. Marx wanted to replace this false consciousness with something Friedrich Engels termed &quot;class consciousness&quot;, the workers&#x27; recognition of themselves as a class unified in opposition to capitalists and ultimately to the capitalist system itself. In general, Marx wanted the proletarians to rise up against the capitalists and overthrow the capitalist system.

Lester Frank Ward directly attacked and attempted to systematically refute the elite business class&#x27; laissez-faire philosophy as espoused by the hugely popular social philosopher Herbert Spencer. Ward&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Sociology&quot; (1883) was an extended thesis on how to reduce conflict and competition in society and thus optimize human progress. At the most basic level, Ward saw human nature itself to be deeply conflicted between self- and altruism, between emotion and intellect, and between male and female. These conflicts would be then reflected in society and Ward assumed there had been a &quot;perpetual and vigorous struggle&quot; among various &quot;social forces&quot; that shaped civilization. Ward was more optimistic than Marx and Gumplowicz and believed that it was possible to build on and reform present social structures with the help of sociological analysis.

== Modern approaches ==
C. Wright Mills has been called the founder of &quot;modern conflict theory&quot;. In Mills&#x27;s view, social structures are created through conflict between people with differing interests and resources. Individuals and resources, in turn, are influenced by these structures and by the &quot;unequal distribution of power and resources in the society.&quot; The power elite of American society, (i.e., the military–industrial complex) had &quot;emerged from the fusion of the corporate elite, the Pentagon, and the executive branch of government.&quot; Mills argued that the interests of this elite were opposed to those of the people. He theorized that the policies of the power elite would result in &quot;increased escalation of conflict, production of weapons of mass destruction, and possibly the annihilation of the human race.&quot;

Gene Sharp (1928-2018) was a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. He is known for his extensive writings on nonviolent struggle, which have influenced numerous anti-government resistance movements around the world. In 1983 he founded the Albert Einstein Institution, a non-profit organization devoted to studies and promotion of the use of nonviolent action in conflicts worldwide. Sharp&#x27;s key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state—regardless of its particular structural organization—ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects&#x27; obedience to the orders of the ruler or rulers. If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power. Sharp has been called both the &quot;Machiavelli of nonviolence&quot; and the &quot;Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare.&quot; Sharp&#x27;s scholarship has influenced resistance organizations around the world. More recently, the protest movement that toppled President Mubarak of Egypt drew extensively on his ideas, as well as the youth movement in Tunisia, and the earlier ones in the Eastern European colour revolutions that had previously been inspired by Sharp&#x27;s work.

A recent articulation of conflict theory is found in Canadian sociologist Alan Sears&#x27; book &quot;A Good Book, in Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking&quot; (2008):

* Societies are defined by inequality that produces conflict, rather than which produces order and consensus. This conflict based on inequality can only be overcome through a fundamental transformation of the existing relations in the society, and is productive of new social relations.
* The disadvantaged have structural interests that run counter to the &quot;status quo&quot;, which, once they are assumed, will lead to social change. Thus, they are viewed as agents of change rather than objects one should feel sympathy for.
* Human potential (e.g., capacity for creativity) is suppressed by conditions of exploitation and oppression, which are necessary in any society with an unequal division of labour. These and other qualities do not necessarily have to be stunted due to the requirements of the so-called &quot;civilizing process,&quot; or &quot;functional necessity&quot;: creativity is actually an engine for economic development and change.
* The role of theory is in realizing human potential and transforming society, rather than maintaining the power structure. The opposite aim of theory would be the objectivity and detachment associated with positivism, where theory is a neutral, explanatory tool.
* Consensus is a euphemism for ideology. Genuine consensus is not achieved, rather the more powerful in societies are able to impose their conceptions on others and have them accept their discourses. Consensus does not preserve social order, it entrenches stratification, a tool of the current social order.
* The State serves the particular interests of the most powerful while claiming to represent the interests of all. Representation of disadvantaged groups in State processes may cultivate the notion of full participation, but this is an illusion/ideology.
* Inequality on a global level is characterized by the purposeful underdevelopment of Third World countries, both during colonization and after national independence. The global system (i.e., development agencies such as World Bank and International Monetary Fund) benefits the most powerful countries and multi-national corporations, rather than the subjects of development, through economic, political, and military actions.

Although Sears associates the conflict theory approach with Marxism, he argues that it is the foundation for much &quot;feminist, post-modernist, anti-racist, and lesbian-gay liberationist theories.&quot;

Conflict theory has three assumptions:
* Humans are self-interested.
* Societies operate under perpetual scarcity of resources.
* Conflict is pervasive and unavoidable within social groups and between social groups.

==Types==
Conflict theory is most commonly associated with Marxism, but as a reaction to functionalism and the positivist method, it may also be associated with a number of other perspectives, including:
* Critical theory
* Feminist theory: An approach that recognizes women&#x27;s political, social, and economic equality to men. 
* Postmodern theory: An approach that is critical of modernism, with a mistrust of grand theories and ideologies.
* Post-structural theory
* Postcolonial theory
* Queer theory: A growing body of research findings that challenges the heterosexual bias in Western society.
* World systems theory
* Race-conflict approach: A point of view that focuses on inequality and conflict between people of different racial and ethnic categories.
* Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)

==Criticism==
Conflict theory has been criticised for being too politicised by its association with Marx and its widespread use by advocates in numerous causes and movements. Critics also argue it downplays unity in society while taking a negative view of society.

<doc id="266958" wikidata="Q815013" url="?curid=266958" title="Westminster Confession of Faith">
<text>The Westminster Confession of Faith, or simply the Westminster Confession, is a Reformed confession of faith. Drawn up by the 1646 Westminster Assembly as part of the Westminster Standards to be a confession of the Church of England, it became and remains the &quot;subordinate standard&quot; of doctrine in the Church of Scotland and has been influential within Presbyterian churches worldwide.

In 1643, the English Parliament called upon &quot;learned, godly and judicious &quot; to meet at Westminster Abbey in order to provide advice on issues of worship, doctrine, government and discipline of the Church of England. Their meetings, over a period of five years, produced the confession of faith, as well as a Larger Catechism and a Shorter Catechism. For more than three hundred years, various churches around the world have adopted the confession and the catechisms as their standards of doctrine, subordinate to the Bible. For the Church of Scotland and the various denominations which spring from it directly, though, only the Confession and not the Catechisms is the subordinate standard, the Catechisms not being re-legislated in 1690.

The Westminster Confession was modified and adopted by Congregationalists in England in the form of the Savoy Declaration (1658). English Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and some Anglicans, would together come to be known as Nonconformists, because they did not conform to the Act of Uniformity (1662) establishing the Church of England as the only legally approved church, though they were in many ways united by their common confessions, built on the Westminster Confession.

==Historical situation==
During the English Civil War (1642–1649), the English Parliament raised armies in an alliance with the Covenanters who by then were the de facto government of Scotland, against the forces of Charles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland. The purpose of the Westminster Assembly, in which 121 Puritan clergymen participated, was to provide official documents for the reformation of the Church of England. The Church of Scotland had recently overthrown the bishops imposed by the King and reinstated presbyterianism (see Bishops&#x27; Wars). For this reason, as a condition for entering into the alliance with the English Parliament, the Scottish Parliament formed the Solemn League and Covenant with the English Parliament, which meant that the Church of England would abandon episcopalianism and consistently adhere to reformed standards of doctrine and worship. The Confession and Catechisms were produced in order to secure the help of the Scots against the king.

The work of the Westminster Assembly was a product of the British Reformed tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty-Nine Articles as well as the theology of James Ussher and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also considered themselves to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians.The Scottish Commissioners who were present at the Assembly were satisfied with the Confession of Faith, and in 1646, the document was sent to the English parliament to be ratified, and submitted to the General Assembly of the Scottish Kirk. The Church of Scotland adopted the document, without amendment, in 1647. In England, the House of Commons returned the document to the Assembly with the requirement to compile a list of proof texts from Scripture. After vigorous debate, the Confession was then in part adopted as the Articles of Christian Religion in 1648, by act of the English parliament, omitting section 4 of chapter 20 (Of Christian Liberty), sections 4–6 of chapter 24 (Of Marriage and Divorce), and chapters 30 and 31 (Of Church Censures and Of Synods and Councils). The next year, the Scottish parliament ratified the Confession without amendment.

In 1660, the Restoration of the British monarchy and Anglican episcopacy resulted in the nullification of these acts of the two parliaments. However, when William of Orange replaced the Catholic King James VII of Scotland and II of England on the thrones of Scotland, England and Ireland, he gave royal assent to the Scottish parliament&#x27;s ratification of the Confession (but not the Catechisms), again without change, in 1690.

==Contents==
The confession is a systematic exposition of Calvinist theology (which neo-orthodox scholars refer to as &quot;scholastic Calvinism&quot;), influenced by Puritan and covenant theology. It includes doctrines common to most of Christianity such as the Trinity and Jesus&#x27; sacrificial death and resurrection, and it contains doctrines specific to Protestantism such as &quot;sola scriptura&quot; and &quot;sola fide&quot;. Its more controversial features include the covenant of works with Adam, the Puritan doctrine that assurance of salvation is not a necessary consequence of faith, a minimalist conception of worship, and Puritan Sabbatarianism.

It states that the Pope is the Antichrist, which was a very common belief in seventeenth-century England. It also stated that the Catholic mass is a form of idolatry, that the civil magistrates have divine authority to punish heresy, and rules out marriage with non-Christians.

===Holy Scriptures, the Trinity and predestination===
The confession begins with a definition of the Bible&#x27;s content as well as an explication of its role within the church. Chapter 1 declares that the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, written Word of God. As the Word of God, the Bible is considered &quot;the rule of faith and life.&quot; The Holy Scriptures are said to possess infallible truth and divine authority, containing &quot;all things necessary for [God&#x27;s] own glory, man&#x27;s salvation, faith, and life&quot;, so that no new revelations or human traditions can be added to it. The Confession of Faith states that, in the original languages, the Bible was kept pure and authentic. Because of this, the Scriptures alone are the church&#x27;s final authority in all religious disputes. The confession states that &quot;the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture&quot; is &quot;the supreme judge&quot; of councils, ancient writers, doctrines, and private revelation.

After describing the attributes of God, chapter 2 of the confession endorses the traditional doctrine of the Trinity, which holds that the one and only God exists as three persons, &quot;of one substance, power, and eternity&quot;, namely, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

Chapter 3 affirms the Calvinist doctrine of predestination: that God foreordained who would be among the elect (and therefore saved), while he passed by those who would be damned for their sins. The confession states that from eternity God did &quot;freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass&quot;. By God&#x27;s decree, &quot;some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life; and others foreordained to everlasting death.&quot;

Chapter 4 recounts the Genesis creation narrative and affirms that human beings were created in the image of God with immortal souls, having fellowship with God and dominion over other creatures. Chapter 6 recounts the Fall of Man whereby humans committed original sin and became subject to total depravity. According to the confession, the consequence of the fall and sin is that sinners are guilty before God, under divine wrath and the curse of the law, and, ultimately, subject to spiritual death. The confession states that the fall and all other sins were foreordained by divine providence; however, the confession also teaches that sin &quot;proceedeth only from the creature, and not from God&quot;. God cannot be the author of sin because he is entirely holy and righteous.

===Covenant theology, Christ&#x27;s mediation and free will===
Chapter 7 is a description of covenant theology, which holds that God has dealt with humans through various covenants. In the first covenant, a covenant of works, Adam and his descendants were promised life on the condition of perfect obedience. The fall made it impossible for man to keep this covenant, so God made another covenant, this one called the covenant of grace. In the covenant of grace, God freely offered sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ. As part of this covenant, God promises to give the elect the Holy Spirit to make them willing and able to believe.

According to the confession, the covenant of grace was administered differently in the time of the law (during Old Testament times) and in the time of the gospel (during and after New Testament times). Under the law, the covenant was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances instituted among the Jewish people. These all anticipated Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, and were sufficient to give the elect of that time forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation. The confession teaches that under the gospel, the covenant of grace is dispensed more fully through the preaching of the Bible and the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

Chapter 8 declares that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, was chosen by God the Father to be the mediator between God and man and hold the threefold office of prophet, priest, and king. It affirms his incarnation, virgin birth, and dual nature as both God and man. In his human nature, Christ was without sin. He was crucified and buried, and the confession teaches that he was bodily resurrected and afterward ascended into heaven where he intercedes on behalf of the living. It also teaches that Christ will return to earth to judge the world.

Chapter 8 also describes Christ&#x27;s sacrificial death as satisfying God&#x27;s justice and attaining both humanity&#x27;s reconciliation with God and everlasting life for the elect. Salvation is granted to individuals by means of the word of God and the Holy Spirit, who persuades them to believe and obey. Chapter 9 teaches that man&#x27;s will is free, and that because of the fall, man lost the ability to do anything spiritually pleasing to God, and man&#x27;s will became enslaved to his sinful nature. Man, after conversion, regains the ability to please God and to choose good, but sin remains within. Complete sinless perfection is only attainable after death in the state of glorification.

===Salvation===

Chapters 10 through 18 describe various phases or aspects of salvation. The confession teaches that—by the Holy Spirit and the preaching of the word—God effectually calls the elect out of the state of sin and death toward faith in Jesus Christ and spiritual life. It teaches that &quot;elect infants&quot; and &quot;all other elect persons who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the ministry of the Word&quot; are regenerated and saved.

Chapter 11 covers the doctrine of justification. It affirms the Reformation doctrines of justification by faith alone and the imputation of Christ&#x27;s righteousness to the elect (the Catholic teaching of infused righteousness is specifically rejected). Justification can never be lost, but the justified are still able to sin and, as a result, confession and repentance must be ongoing. Chapter 12 states that all who are justified also partake in the grace of adoption and become children of God. In addition, those who are effectually called and regenerated are also sanctified. In sanctification, the dominion of sin is eliminated and lust is weakened and suppressed as the individual grows in .

Chapter 14 defines saving faith as that which enables people to believe to the saving of their souls. The confession states that it is the work of the Holy Spirit and is ordinarily accomplished by the preaching of the word. Saving faith is strengthened and increased by the preaching of the word, the sacraments, and prayer. This faith enables a person to believe that whatever is revealed in the Bible is true and to rest on Christ alone for eternal life.

Chapter 15 stresses the need for repentance alongside saving faith. While repentance (rejecting sin and committing to obey God&#x27;s commandments) does not earn forgiveness (which is the result of divine grace), the confession states that no sinner &quot;may expect pardon without it.&quot; The confession also describes the role of private and public confession of sin in the life of a Christian. Chapter 16 explains the role of good works (actions done in obedience to God&#x27;s commandments) in the Christian life and their relationship to salvation. Good works are said to be the result of the Holy Spirit&#x27;s influence and are evidence of true faith; however, good works cannot earn or merit salvation or forgiveness of sins.

Chapter 17 presents the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, which holds that it is impossible for those effectually called to &quot;fall away&quot; from the state of grace or, in other words, lose their salvation. Chapter 18 states that believers can receive assurance of faith. This assurance is based on &quot;the promises of salvation, the inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises are made, the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God&quot;. The confession does not teach that assurance is instantaneous upon conversion; rather, it states that &quot;a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties, before he be partaker of it&quot;.

===Law, Christian liberty and worship===
Chapter 19 discusses God&#x27;s law and Christian ethics. The confession states that while the ceremonial parts of biblical law have been abrogated under the New Covenant, the moral law as described in the Ten Commandments and the &quot;general equity&quot; of the civil law in the Old Testament remains binding to all people and nations. While true believers are neither &quot;justified, or condemned&quot; by the law, it serves &quot;as a rule of life informing them of the will of God, and their duty&quot;. The confession also teaches that the Holy Spirit enables &quot;the will of man to do that freely, and cheerfully, which the will of God, revealed in the law, requireth to be done.&quot;

Chapter 20 states that &quot;God alone is Lord of the conscience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men.&quot; The purpose of Christian liberty is to enable Christians to &quot;serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him.&quot; The confession warns that Christian liberty cannot be used to justify sinful behavior or to resist lawful secular and church authority.

Chapter 21 describes the acceptable parameters of Reformed worship as governed by the regulative principle of worship. It also outlines a Puritan Sabbatarian position in regards to Christian behavior on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath. Chapter 22 describes the appropriate use of oaths and solemn vows, which are part of religious worship because the person calls upon God.

===Civil government and marriage===
Chapter 23 describes the role of the civil authorities in relation to the church. Governments are ordained by God to maintain justice and peace and to punish evil doers. The civil magistrate has no right to interfere with the preaching of the word of God or administration of the sacraments. The power of the keys is reserved exclusively to church authorities. Nevertheless, the civil magistrate has a duty to preserve church unity, suppress heresy, and prevent corruption and abuse within the church. To fulfill these obligations, the magistrate has authority to convene synods and ensure that its deliberations are agreeable to &quot;the mind of God.&quot;

Chapter 23 also teaches that Christians are obligated to pray for civil authorities and to obey lawful commands. A magistrate&#x27;s legal authority is not lost because of unbelief or religious differences. The confession denies that the Pope has any jurisdiction over civil magistrates or authority to deprive magistrates of their office if he determines them to be heretics.

Chapter 24 covers Reformed teaching on marriage and divorce. Marriage is to be heterosexual and monogamous. The purpose of marriage is to provide for the mutual help of husband and wife, the birth of legitimate children, the growth of the church, and the prevention of &quot;uncleanness.&quot; The confession discourages interfaith marriage with non-Christians, Roman Catholics, or &quot;other idolaters&quot;. In addition, godly persons should not be &quot;unequally yoked&quot; in marriage to &quot;notoriously wicked&quot; persons. Incestuous marriage, defined according to biblical guidelines, is also prohibited. The only grounds for divorce are adultery and willful abandonment by a spouse.

===Church===
Chapter 25 addresses Reformed ecclesiology or the teachings about the Christian Church. The confession teaches that the church is catholic (or universal) and both invisible and visible. The invisible church is made up of all the elect who will ever live. Christ is the head of the church, and the church is the body of Christ and the bride of Christ. The visible church includes all people alive throughout the world who &quot;profess the true religion&quot; and their children. It is described as the kingdom of Christ and the house and family of God. The confession teaches that there is no ordinary possibility of salvation outside of the visible church. It is said that Christ gave to the visible church &quot;the ministry, oracles, and ordinances of God&quot; for the perfecting of the saints.

The confession teaches that local churches can be more or less pure depending on how faithfully they adhere to correct doctrine and worship. Yet, it acknowledges that even the purest churches might contain some theological error, while other churches have become so corrupted that they can no longer be called churches of Christ but instead are of Satan. The confession affirms that only Jesus Christ can be head of the church. It states that the pope is an Antichrist who &quot;exalteth himself, in the Church, against Christ and all that is called God.&quot;

Chapter 26 presents Reformed teaching on the communion of saints. This is the spiritual union that Christians have with Christ and with one another that allows them to share in the grace, suffering, death, resurrection, and glory of Christ.

===Sacraments===
Chapter 27 summarizes Reformed sacramental theology. It states that sacraments were established by God as &quot;signs and seals&quot; of the covenant of grace to represent Christ and his benefits, to visibly differentiate members of the church from the rest of world and draw them to God&#x27;s service. The confession teaches that in every sacrament there is a spiritual relation between the sign and what is being signified; because of this, the names and effects of one are attributed to the other. The effectiveness of a sacrament depends upon the work of the Holy Spirit and the words of institution, which contains a promise of benefit to worthy receivers. The confession teaches that only ordained ministers can provide the sacraments, of which there are only two: baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

Chapter 28 presents a summary of Reformed baptismal theology. Baptism joins a person to the visible church and signifies the person&#x27;s union with Christ, regeneration, forgiveness of sin and newness of life. Individuals should be baptized in water using the Trinitarian formula (&quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost&quot;). Baptism by immersion is not necessary; affusion and aspersion are acceptable modes. The confession approves of infant baptism if one or both parents are Christians. While it teaches that neglecting baptism is a &quot;great sin&quot;, the confession does not endorse baptismal regeneration in the ex opere operato sense. It states that it is possible to be regenerated without baptism, and unregenerated with baptism. This is because the effectiveness of baptism is not tied to the moment in time it is administered; the grace promised is granted by the Holy Spirit to the elect according to God&#x27;s own will and at the time of his choosing. According to the confession, baptism is to be received only once.

Chapter 29 summarizes Presbyterian beliefs about the Lord&#x27;s Supper. It states that the sacrament is to be observed in the church until the end of the world &quot;for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of Himself in His death; the sealing all benefits thereof, unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in Him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto Him; and, to be a bond and pledge of their communion with Him, and with each other, as members of His mystical body.&quot;

The confession states that the Lord&#x27;s Supper is not the actual sacrifice of Christ but rather a commemoration of Christ&#x27;s one sacrifice for the remission of sins and an offering of praise to God. It explicitly condemns the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching of &quot;the popish sacrifice of the mass&quot;. It also rejects the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which states that after consecration by a priest the bread and wine miraculously become the body and blood of Christ. Rather, the confession teaches that communicants receive the body and blood of Christ and all the benefits of his death spiritually by faith, while the bread and wine remain physically unchanged. Ignorant, wicked and ungodly persons may eat the bread and wine, but they do not receive Christ. Instead, these unworthy persons are &quot;guilty of the body and blood of the Lord&quot; and commit great sin; for this reason, such persons should not be admitted to the sacrament.

===Church government and discipline===

Chapter 30 describes the role of church officers, who are appointed by Christ to govern the church. These officers hold the keys of the kingdom, giving them power to discipline church members through admonition, suspension from the Lord&#x27;s Supper for a period of time, and excommunication, according to the severity of the offense. Church discipline is for the purpose of leading sinful church members to repentance, deterring others from similar behavior, vindicating the honor of Christ, and preventing the wrath of God from falling on the entire church.

Chapter 31 states that synods and church councils have authority to settle religious controversies, make rules for the church and public worship, and judge cases of misconduct in the church. While synods may be called by civil authorities, they only have jurisdiction over ecclesiastical affairs and are not to intervene in civil affairs except &quot;by way of humble petition in cases extraordinary; or, by way of advice&quot;.

===Eschatology===
Chapters 32 and 33 concern Christian eschatology. Chapter 32 describes what occurs after death—while the body decomposes, the immortal soul immediately returns to God. The souls of the righteous are then made perfect in holiness and received into heaven where they &quot;behold the face of God&quot; and wait for the redemption of their bodies. The souls of the wicked are sent to hell where they remain in torment until the judgment. The confession rejects the idea of purgatory because it is not present in scripture. The confession teaches that on the last day, those alive will not die but will be changed, and all the dead will be resurrected with the same bodies they had when alive. The bodies of the unjust will be &quot;raised to dishonour&quot;, but the bodies of the just will be raised &quot;unto honour&quot; .

Chapter 33 describes the Last Judgment in which the Father will give Christ authority to judge all apostate angels and every person that has lived on earth. Those judged will &quot;give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds&quot; and will &quot;receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.&quot; God&#x27;s purpose in dispensing judgment is to show the glory of his mercy—by saving the elect—and of his justice—by the damnation of the reprobate. The righteous will receive eternal life in the presence of God, and the wicked will receive eternal torment and destruction. The date and time of the Last Judgment is unknown.

==Usage==
The Westminster Confession was adopted as a doctrinal standard by various Presbyterian churches around the world. These churches have at times repudiated or changed different parts of the confession over the years.

===Australia===
The Presbyterian Church of Australia holds to the Westminster Confession as its standard, subordinate to the Word of God, and read in the light of a declaratory statement. The Reformed Presbyterian Church of Australia also holds to the Confession as a subordinate standard.

===England and Wales===
*Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales - subordinate standard (excepting the authority of the &quot;civil magistrate&quot; over presbyteries in religious or moral matters and the identification of the Antichrist exclusively with the papacy which is deemed a matter of individual interpretation). Additionally, individual elders and sessions may determine their own positions on the establishment principle as concerns the relationship between the church and state and the question of marriages to close relatives of deceased spouses.

===Scotland===
*Church of Scotland - subordinate standard but since 1986 has dissociated itself from four sections of the Confession (relating to monastic vows, marriage to Catholics and non-Christians, the identification of the Pope with the Antichrist and the Mass). Additionally, liberty of opinion is granted on those matters which do not enter into the substance of the faith.
*Free Church of Scotland - subordinate standard
*Free Church of Scotland -Continuing (since 2000)
*Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland (Since 1893)
*Associated Presbyterian Church (since 1989)
*United Free Church of Scotland - subordinate standard (but with liberty of judgement allowed on matters which do not enter into the substance of the faith)

===Ireland (including Northern Ireland)===
*The Presbyterian Church in Ireland accepts the Westminster Confession as its subordinate standard, along with the Shorter and Larger Catechisms.
*The Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster retains the Confession as its “subordinate standard” of doctrine.

===United States===

With the Adopting Act of 1729, the Synod of Philadelphia officially adopted the Westminster Confession as the doctrinal standard for American Presbyterians. All ministerial candidates were required to subscribe to it but were allowed to declare scruples to those parts considered nonessential. This compromise left a permanent legacy to following generations of Presbyterians in America resulting in permanent controversies over the manner in which a minister is bound to accept the document; and it has left the American versions of the Westminster Confession more amenable to the will of the church to amend it.

When the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was formed in 1789, it adopted the Westminster standards, as containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures. However, it revised chapters 20.4, 23.3, and 31.2 of the Confession, basically removing the civil magistrate (i.e., the state) from involvement in ecclesiastical matters. It also removed the phrase &quot;tolerating a false religion&quot; from the list of sins forbidden in Answer 109 of the Larger Catechism, and replaced &quot;depopulations&quot; in Answer 142 with &quot;depredation.&quot; The Confession was amended again in 1887, when the final sentence of chapter 24.4, which forbade the marrying of the close kindred of one&#x27;s deceased spouse, was removed.

The Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. adopted more sweeping revisions of its Confession in 1903. Chapter 16.7, on the works of unregenerate men, was rewritten. The last sentence of chapter 22.3, which forbade the refusing of a proper oath when imposed by lawful authority, was removed. Chapter 25.6, on the head of the church, was rewritten, and the identification of the Roman Catholic pope as the Antichrist was removed.

<text>Manchester Airport is an international airport in Ringway, Manchester, England, south-west of Manchester city centre. In 2022, it was the third busiest airport in the United Kingdom in terms of passengers (the busiest outside of London) and the 19th-busiest airport in Europe in 2023, with 28.1 million passengers served.

The airport comprises a cargo terminal and three passenger terminals – although a £1.3 billion redevelopment programme will merge Terminals 1 and 2 in 2025. It covers an area of and has flights to 199 destinations, placing the airport thirteenth globally for total destinations served.

Officially opened on 25 June 1938, it was initially known as Ringway Airport, a name still in local use. In World War II, as RAF Ringway, it was a base for the Royal Air Force. The airport is owned and managed by Manchester Airports Group (MAG), a group owned by the ten metropolitan borough councils of Greater Manchester, with Manchester City Council owning the largest stake, and the Australian finance house IFM Investors. Ringway, after which the airport was named, is a village with a few buildings and a church at the western edge of the airport.

In 2017, an 8-year redevelopment programme commenced which will culminate with the merger of Terminals 1 and 2 to form one large terminal to better facilitate transfers. The new terminal, due for completion in 2025, will take 80% of all passenger traffic. Terminal 3 will remain with a focus on low-cost, short-haul airlines.

==History==
Construction commenced in Ringway parish on 28 November 1935 and the airport was partially operational by June 1937, with full construction completed on 25 June 1938. Its northern border was Yewtree Lane between Firtree Farm and The Grange, east of the crossroads marked &quot;Ringway&quot;, and its southeast border a little west of Altrincham Road, along the lane from Oversleyford running northeast then east into Styal. In 1938, KLM became the first airline to launch scheduled commercial flights to Manchester.

During World War II, RAF Ringway was important in military aircraft production and training parachutists. After the War, the base reverted to a civilian airport and gradually expanded to its present size. Manchester was Britain&#x27;s second-busiest airport, after Heathrow, by the 1960s.

In 1946, Air France began operations from Manchester following the commencement of peacetime passenger services from the airport, and remains the airport&#x27;s longest continuous operator, celebrating 75 years of service in 2021. In 1953, Manchester began 24-hour operation, with the ability to handle flights during the day and night, which helped the airport handle 163,000 passengers. 1953 also saw the start of intercontinental flights by Sabena Belgian to New York, followed closely by the launch of services to New York by BOAC.
The first transatlantic flights to originate at Manchester began in 1963. The thrice-weekly service was operated by BOAC using a Boeing 707 via Prestwick. In 1969, the runway was extended to , allowing aircraft to take off with a full payload and to fly non-stop to Canada.

In 1971, the airport reached a milestone of handling over 2million passengers in one year. The following year saw the opening of a link road connecting the airport to the M56 Motorway, improving road access from Manchester, Cheshire and North Wales. In 1975, Ringway was officially renamed Manchester International Airport.

The airport saw rapid growth and expansion during the 1980s and 1990s, shaping the airport for the coming decades. Many of the developments made during this period remain in place or have only recently been altered following the introduction of the Manchester Transformation Project. Passenger numbers continued to grow, reaching the milestone of handling one million passengers a month for the first time in 1987. This growth boosted expansion plans, including planning for a new terminal. The following year, in 1988 Manchester celebrated its Golden jubilee.

Terminal A, which now forms part of Terminal 3, was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1989. In 1993, Terminal 2 was officially opened by the Duke of Edinburgh along with the official opening of Manchester Airport station. From 1997 to 2001, a second runway was constructed, causing large-scale protests in Cheshire, especially in the village of Styal where natural habitats were disturbed and listed buildings demolished to make space for construction.

During the early 2000s, British Airways scaled down operations from Manchester Airport with the sale of their BA Connect subsidiary to Flybe and the ending of their franchise agreement with GB Airways, a business subsequently sold to easyJet. In October 2008, the daily New York–JFK service was terminated and in March 2013 the daily to London–Gatwick was ended, although the service has resumed in recent years.

Since taking over BA Connect&#x27;s select routes, Flybe has gone on to add several more destinations. In 2012, Flybe introduced the &quot;mini hub&quot; concept co-ordinating the arrival and departure times of various domestic services throughout the day and thereby creating combinations such as Norwich–Manchester–Belfast, Glasgow–Manchester–Southampton and Edinburgh–Manchester–Exeter with conveniently short transfer times.

The Airbus A380 arrived in 2010, operated by Emirates, which continues to operate the aircraft up to three times daily on its route to Dubai.

Manchester Airport celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2013. That year also saw the completion and opening of the newly constructed air traffic control tower – which is now located in an independent tower, not on top of the airport as previously – and Airport City Manchester gained planning approval. During 2013, Virgin Atlantic introduced its Little Red short-haul brand to take-up some of the available Heathrow and Gatwick slots, which resulted from BMI ceasing operations. Manchester was the inaugural destination, with services were operated by aircraft leased from Aer Lingus. However, these services ceased in March 2015 because of low sales.

In 2014, the Manchester Airport Metrolink route launched as part of the route expansion plans of the Manchester Metrolink tramway, aiding transport to and from the airport to the city centre.

In 2019, the first phase of the new Terminal 2 extension was completed, and Pier 1 opened on 1 April 2019. The second phase of the extension plan opened on 14 July 2021.

During the later part of the decade, Monarch Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines and Flybe all entered administration and ceased operations, having a major impact on local employment and operations at Manchester, as well as leaving thousands of passengers stranded, many abroad. Monarch was an operator at Manchester between 1981 and 2017, operating short and medium flights to Europe, and had its own maintenance base at the airport. It entered administration and ceased operations in 2017. Thomas Cook Airlines was a major operator at Manchester, operating scheduled and charter flights to over 50 destinations in Europe, America and the Caribbean. Its parent company also had a maintenance base at the airport. The airline entered compulsory liquidation in September 2019, with many aircraft left parked at the airport while payment disputes were concluded. Flybe was a British airline with a significant base at Manchester, which provided more than half of UK domestic flights outside London. Plans were formulated by a consortium Including Stobart Air and Virgin Atlantic to save FlyBe with the launch of Connect Airways, but plans were dropped in early 2020 and all operations ceased.

Like most British and international airports, Manchester has been severely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent reduction in air passengers. A number of airlines ceased, paused or reduced routes to the airport. The reduced passenger numbers saw the temporary closure of both Terminals 2 and 3. In late 2020 American Airlines announced that its daily flights to Philadelphia would cease operation amid ongoing travel disruption caused by the Coronavirus outbreak. The departure of American Airlines also marked the final US-based airline at Manchester. American Airlines had previously operated services to New York–JFK, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Boston, and Charlotte. Data recorded and published by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) show that during the first 11 months (January through November) of 2020, passenger &#x27;Terminal &amp; Transit&#x27; numbers dropped from 29,374,282 in 2019 to 6,787,127 in 2020.

==Future==

As part of the Government&#x27;s Future of Air Transport white paper, Manchester Airport published its Master Plan on its proposed expansions until 2030. Demolition of older buildings, such as old storage buildings, the old Alpha Catering Building and Males Garage, to the east of Terminal 2 has already begun, to make way for a new apron and taxiway towards runway 05L/23R and an eastwards extension of Terminal 2, which is planned to provide fifteen more covered stands.

The World Logistics Hub is also part of the Airport City Enterprise Developments in south Manchester. This development is designed to meet the growing demand for cargo handling space and infrastructure outside of the southeast. Positioned on the southwest side of the A538 road, next to the southeast side of the M56 motorway across the A538 from the World Freight Terminal, it provides access to the trunk motorway network via Junction 6.

Manchester Airport has development plans to meet the growing demand to fly. One document, &quot;The Need for Land&quot;, outlines several development ideas. Five affected areas are:
* Area A is a triangle of land between the A538 road and Runway 1 and the cargo terminal which is currently under development. It will be used together with Area E, a triangle of land west of the A538 up to the M56, with its west corner opposite Warburton Green, for the expansion of aircraft maintenance, vehicle maintenance/storage and cargo handling. The Clough Bank and Cotterill Clough areas are being enhanced with mitigation areas that will become part of the extensive Landscape Habitat Management Area. The A538 alignment to be retained and capacity has been added, as required, to meet increased traffic volumes.
* Area B is north of Ringway Road and east of Shadow Moss Road, and a car park has been provided to replace spaces lost to the Airport City development and apron/terminal expansion.
* Area C consists of several areas of land mainly inside the M56/M56 spur junction, around Hasty Lane east of M56 and around the current M56 spur. The land will be used for hotels and office space. Terminal 1&#x27;s current capacity is around 11million passengers a year, compared with an annual capacity of 2.5 million passengers when it first opened.

In the summer of 2009, a £50 million redevelopment programme for Terminal 1 was completed, as well as the construction of new car parking facilities and taxiways for aircraft.
* Area D consists of areas of land on both sides of Manchester Airport railway spur, at Smithy Farm and east of B5166 Styal Road around and inside railway spur junction where car parking, offices, hotels, etc. can be developed.

==Passenger terminals==


Manchester Airport has three passenger terminals (Terminals 1, 2 and 3). Terminals 1 and 2 are linked by the &quot;skylink&quot;, with travelators to aid passengers with the 10–15-minute walk. Terminal 3 is linked to Terminal 1 and the &quot;skylink&quot; by a covered walkway. The &quot;skylink&quot; also connects the terminals to the airport railway station complex (known as &quot;The Station&quot;) and the Radisson BLU Hotel. Skylink 1 started construction in 1991 and opened 1993. Skylink 2 opened in September 1996 along with the Radisson.

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1 is used by airlines with scheduled and charter operations, flying to European and other worldwide destinations. It is the second largest terminal at the airport. It was opened in 1962, by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and it is a base for easyJet. Terminal 1 is spread over an area of .

The terminal has two piers which combined have 29 stands, of which 15 have air bridges. Gate 12 was specially adapted to accommodate the Airbus A380, which is operated by Emirates on their route three times per day from Dubai to Manchester. Terminal 1&#x27;s current capacity is around 11million passengers a year, compared with an annual capacity of 2.5 million passengers when it first opened.

In the Summer of 2009, a £50 million redevelopment programme for Terminal 1 was completed, which included a new £14 million 14-lane security area. Passenger flow on Terminal 1&#x27;s gating piers is due to be realigned, with plans to redesign the piers so departures and arrivals do not contraflow on the same level, allowing larger seating areas at the gates, express retail outlets and a dedicated lounge and gating area for future Airbus A380 flights. Currently only Gate 12, Pier B, has been upgraded to accommodate the A380. Part of this work saw the removal of the South Bay remote aircraft stands, constructed in 1962 between taxiways Juliet and Kilo and more recently re-aligning taxiway Juliet into an extended taxiway Bravo.

Terminal 1 is not planned to be included in the ten-year airport expansion project, and will shut in 2025 when the new Terminal 2 is completed. In 2025, Airlines operating from Terminal 1 will move across to the new Terminal 2, and Terminal 1 will be &#x27;Mothballed&#x27;.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 is used by a variety of airlines, operating both charter and scheduled flights to many European and worldwide destinations.

Terminal 2 is spread over an area of and has 16 gates, of which 20 have air bridges. The design of the terminal makes it capable of extensive expansion; building work has begun for an extension providing additional gates, together with the construction of a satellite pier. Terminal 2&#x27;s current capacity is around 8 million passengers a year; this will be extended to ultimately handle 25 million passengers a year. In 2007, an £11 million project commenced to redevelop Terminal 2 by improving security facilities and enhancing retail and catering services.

Terminal 2 received a major extension, completed in 2021, to encompass formerly remote stands to the west. Between twelve and fifteen covered aircraft stands have been made available by this. An air side link for transferring passengers between Terminals 1 and 2 is at the planning stage, designed in an effort to boost Manchester&#x27;s chances of becoming a major hub airport and minimise missed connections. It was announced in June 2015 that the airport would have an expansion taking ten years to complete. Terminal 2 is now the most developed terminal, with new piers and also a larger security hall as well as more outlets.

The first phase of the new extension, Pier 1, opened on 1 April 2019.
 The second phase, the terminal extension, was due to open in April 2020 but was delayed due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, finally opening on 14 July 2021. The third phase, which was announced on 25 January 2023, includes the refurbishment of the existing Terminal 2 featuring a brand new security hall, and also includes the construction of Pier 2. Work is due to be complete in 2025.

===Terminal 3===
Terminal A, as it was then known, was opened in 1989 by Diana, Princess of Wales as a self contained new domestic terminal to replace the original pier A. It had many names before its expansion and re-designation as Terminal 3 in May 1998.
The terminal was known in succession as &quot;Terminal A&quot;; &quot;Terminal A – Domestic&quot;; &quot;Terminal 1A&quot; after Terminal 2 opened in 1993; &quot;Terminal 1A – British Airways and Domestic&quot;; &quot;Terminal 3 – British Airways and Domestic&quot; before becoming simply known as Terminal 3 in 1998. In June 1998, British Airways opened their new £75 million terminal facility designed by Grimshaw Architects, this being a major extension to Terminal A and became the primary user of the terminal along with codeshare partner airlines (Oneworld). Terminal 3 now spreads over an area of .

===Aether Private Terminal===
Work began on the private terminal (adjacent to the Runway visitor park) in 2019 and it opened on 21 October 2019. The terminal has been closed since the COVID pandemic, but re-opened on 4 November 2024.

==Airlines and destinations==

The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Manchester:

==Statistics==
===Annual statistics===

==Operations==

===Maintenance bases===
Manchester Airport is the home to the engineering base of Jet2.com and, up until 23 September 2019, it was also the engineering base of the Thomas Cook Group Airlines. Airlines such as Etihad Airways also have one of six maintenance bases worldwide in Manchester with their newly opened (2011) line maintenance facility.

===World Freight Terminal===

Manchester Airport has a World Freight Terminal, serving cargo-only freighter services and cargo carried on regular passenger flights. It was opened in 1986, west of the original airfield. There are of warehouse and office space on site, including a chiller unit for frozen products and a border inspection post. There are three aircraft maintenance hangars, with five transit sheds, operated by British Airways World Cargo, Swissport Cargo, Menzies World Cargo, and dnata UK. There are over 100 freight forwarding companies on site.

Freight throughput at the airport grew from 94,000 tonnes in 1997 to the peak at 165,000 tonnes in 2007, but then declined to around 93,000 tonnes in 2013, subsequently increasing to over 109,000 tonnes in 2016 making Manchester the fourth-busiest UK airport for freight behind London–Heathrow, East Midlands and London–Stansted airports.

===Runways===

Manchester Airport has two parallel runways. Runway 1 (23R/05L) and Runway 2 (23L/05R) . The parallel runways lie apart and staggered by so that landings can be conducted independently on one runway whilst takeoffs are conducted on the other.

The original main runway, then designated 06/24 and initially in length, opened on 17 May 1937 when the airport was used as an RAF base and a military aircraft assembly centre. It was extended in stages from 1952, reaching its current length in 1981 to attract long-haul international traffic. As demand and aircraft movements both increased during the mid-1990s, mainly due to the newly completed Terminal 2, the airport studied the option of a second full-length runway. A consultation process began and planning permission was approved in 1997, with construction work starting the same year.

The second runway, initially designated 06R/24L, became operational on 5 February 2001 at a cost of £172 million, and was the first full-length commercial runway to open in Britain for over 20 years. The site where the second runway was constructed was on the southern airfield boundary, which is near the village of Styal in the Cheshire countryside. The project was deemed controversial because of the destruction of natural wildlife habitats and because of changes to flight paths to enable aircraft to fly in and out of the second runway. Aircraft landing from the southwest on to Runway 2 (05R) fly lower over the residential area of Knutsford. As aircraft rarely land on to Runway 2 from the northeast (Runway 23L) or takeoff from Runway 2 to the northeast (Runway 05R) there has been no change to the path of aircraft over Heald Green, Cheadle and Stockport.

Planning permission for Runway 2 (23L/05R) permits use of both runways between the hours of 06:0022:00. At night between the hours of 22:0006:00 single runway operations based on Runway 1 (23R/05L) are used. Exceptions are made for emergencies and planned maintenance. In practice, dual runway operations incorporating Runway 2 (23L/05R) are only used at peak demand, which is currently in the morning and then again between 13:0020:00.

Most aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport use the instrument landing system, which in line with most other airports has a glide slope of 3degrees equal to descending per nautical mile. The prevailing wind direction is westerly, so normally aircraft fly from northeast to southwest. In practice this means that normally aircraft land from the northeast over Stockport, Cheadle, and Heald Green, and takeoff towards Knutsford. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 1 (23R) and depart from Runway 2 (23L). When the wind direction changes, usually affecting 20% of movements per annum, operations are reversed with aircraft landing from the southwest, lining up to the south over Northwich and over Knutsford and taking off towards Stockport. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 2 (05R) and depart from Runway 1 (05L). Sometimes, aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport are held in stacks, usually in poor weather when the movement rate decreases. The airport has three stacks: DAYNE, MIRSI and ROSUN, each located approximately 15/20 miles from the airport. DAYNE serves arrivals from the south, ROSUN from the north and east and MIRSI from the west. Residents living within of the airport will likely see and hear aircraft.

===Control tower===
A new control tower was opened on 25 June 2013. At 60 m tall, it is the UK&#x27;s second tallest control tower, after London Heathrow and it replaces the old tower on top of Terminal 1.

===Security===
Manchester Airport is policed by the Greater Manchester Police and Manchester Airport Fire Service. Several security-related incidents have occurred at the airport in recent years.
* In 2002, a security firm successfully smuggled fake explosives, detonators and genuine firearms onto a flight.
* In 2004, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Whistleblower&quot; programme revealed security failures at the airport, including faulty metal detectors and a lack of regular random baggage checks. Many of the claims made on the programme were later discredited and much of the camera work was found to be misleading (filming from a raised footpath was used to suggest there was no security fence on the southern perimeter of the site).
* In 2005, police used a taser on a man spotted acting suspiciously on the apron, after he appeared to resist arrest.
* On 6 June 2006, Aabid Hussain Khan, 21, of West Yorkshire and a 16-year-old boy were arrested at the airport and later charged under Section 57 of the Terrorism Act, for conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause public nuisance by using poisons or explosives.
* On 24 July 2012, an 11-year-old boy went straight through security and managed to board the nearest boarding flight from security in T1, which was a Jet2 flight to Rome. Halfway through the flight one passenger reported him to the cabin crew, who then detained the boy at Rome and put him on the next flight back to Manchester.
* On 5 August 2014, a 47-year-old man was arrested after the pilot of a plane became aware of a potential explosive device on board. This turned out to be a hoax. As a result, Manchester Airport airfield operations were suspended for around 30 minutes whilst the man was led away by armed police. The incident required an escort from an RAF Typhoon jet into Manchester.
* In April 2015, the passengers arriving from Madrid on a Ryanair flight entered the UK without having their passports checked. A spokesman for the airport said it was the responsibility of the airline&#x27;s handling agent to notify the UK Border Force about flights from outside the UK.
* In November 2017, the passengers arriving on an EasyJet flight from Paris were mistakenly directed to departures rather than arrivals. The situation was caused by a door that was opened by a staff member, which led to the cross-contamination of arriving and departing passengers. The security breach resulted in confusion and delays, with a spokesman for the Department of Transport stating that it is the responsibility of airlines and airport operators to ensure passengers arriving in the UK are directed through the correct route.

==Ground transport==

===Rail===

Manchester Airport station, opened in May 1993, is between Terminals 1 and 2. It is linked to the terminals by a &quot;Skylink&quot; moving walkway. Trains operated by Northern, TransPennine Express and Transport for Wales connect the airport to Manchester Piccadilly and other railway stations, mainly throughout northern England, including Crewe, Wigan, Blackpool North railway station, as well as Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland and Holyhead and Llandudno in Wales. A third platform was completed in 2008 to allow for an increase in rail capacity. In 2009, Network Rail stated that the third platform meant that capacity will become constrained by the layover of the trains and recommended building a line underneath the Airport towards Northwich by 2024. Work on building a new fourth platform at the station commenced in early 2014 with a blockade required in February 2015 to allow completion. Construction finished in May 2015 and the platform opened to passengers in autumn 2015.

===Metrolink===
A Metrolink service from Cornbrook station to the Airport opened in November 2014 and runs at 12-minute frequency. Journeys along the 15-stop line from Cornbrook take approximately 35 minutes. The Manchester Metrolink light rail system has had plans to extend to the airport for many years. When the idea of a congestion charge was mooted, part of the scheme was to have extended the Metrolink to the airport. However, when this was rejected, the future of the scheme was in doubt. In 2009, it was announced that the line to the airport would finally be built. The airport line is one spur of the line from St Werburgh&#x27;s Road to East Didsbury and Manchester Airport, which opened on 3 November 2014 – 18 months ahead of schedule. As of November 2022, Metrolink services from the Airport operate to Manchester Victoria via Market Street.

===Bus and coach===
&quot;The Station&quot; is the airport&#x27;s ground transport interchange and brings bus, coach and rail passengers under one roof. Over 300 trains, 100 coaches and 500 buses a day use the facility, including the 24-hour bus service 43, which runs every 10 minutes (every 30 minutes at night) to Manchester city centre via Wythenshawe, Northenden, Withington, Fallowfield and Rusholme. There is also &quot;Skyline&quot; service 199 operating every 30 minutes to Buxton via Stockport, Disley and Chapel-en-le-Frith, as well as a number of Stagecoach Manchester and Arriva North West services to Stockport, Altrincham and various parts of South Manchester. A network of National Express and Megabus coach services serve Manchester Airport and operate to destinations further afield.

===Road===
The airport is a 20-minute drive from Manchester city centre and is reached by the M56 motorway, with a dedicated approach road from the motorway at junction 5. The M56 is the main route used by traffic to reach the airport. There are also minor local roads serving the airport from the north (Wythenshawe) and the east (Heald Green). The M56/A538 road junction serves the World Freight Terminal, to the west of the airport. The A538 runs east–west serving the local towns of Altrincham and Wilmslow. Taxi ranks are situated by arrivals at all three terminals.

Proposed as part of the SEMMMS (South East Manchester Multi-Modal Strategy) Relief Road Scheme, a new link road to the A6 south of Stockport opened in 2018. Planning permission had been granted, with inquiries for Compulsory Purchase and Side Roads Orders following up in September 2014. After significant delays, the link road opened on 15 October 2018.

===Parking===
The airport&#x27;s official short-stay car parking can be found in the multistorey car parks adjacent to Terminals 1, 2 and 3. In July 2007, the airport introduced a &#x27;No Waiting&#x27; restriction on all access roads surrounding the terminals. As of June 2018, the public are required to pay charges of £3 for five minutes on the terminal forecourt or £4 for the maximum ten minutes in order to drop off passengers. 

In 2009/2010, Terminal 1&#x27;s multi-storey car park was refurbished. Each level of the car park is colour-coded. The floor, walls, ceiling and supports have all received a repaint with every parking space having a sensor and green light above it, with empty parking bays indicated by the green light.

Official long-stay on-airport parking from Manchester Airport is located near the terminals and served by a regular courtesy bus. There is one long-stay car park serving Terminals 1 and 3 and a separate dedicated long-stay car park for Terminal 2. In 2009, the airport opened &quot;JetParks&quot; – two long-stay car parks less than a mile from the terminals. This is a cheaper alternative to the on-site car parks and is served by a 24-hour shuttle bus every 15 minutes. The airport also operates a &quot;Shuttle Park&quot; for long-stay car parking, which is also served by a regular courtesy bus and is located just off the airport site to the east of Terminal 3.
The airport has since augmented these products with a 3rd &quot;JetParks&quot; car park, &quot;JetParks 3&quot;. This is located adjacent to Shuttle Parks and, as a result, Shuttle Parks was renamed &quot;JetParks Plus&quot;.
Manchester Airport also operates a very large scale valet parking product across all 3 terminals that it has branded as &quot;Meet &amp; Greet&quot;.

In 2014, a new 9,000 space car park located underneath the approach to 23R was constructed, the first area of the site opened in the autumn. The remainder of the facility will open in time for summer 2015.

There are several privately operated car parks within a short distance of the airport, served by shuttle bus, as well as several off-site companies operating valet parking services.

===Drop off zones===
Up until 2018, cars dropping off passengers could do so outside terminals for free. On 10 July 2018, Manchester Airport took the step of introducing a fee of £3 to £4 for vehicles dropping off passengers at terminals. Alternatively, passengers being dropped off can be taken to an off-site car park from where a shuttle bus operates to the terminals. The airport issues fines of up to £100 to vehicles which breach its terms and conditions for the drop off zones. The changes have been seen as unwelcome and nonconstructive by passengers and taxi drivers, with some saying they will boycott the airport. The change has also attracted criticism from local Councillors in Cheshire, who point out that many places directly under Manchester Airport&#x27;s flight paths do not have a direct public transport link to the airport. While some other UK airports also have drop off charges, Manchester Airport&#x27;s charges are overall higher than those at any other airport.

==Effect on the area==

Between 1997 and 1999 three protest camps were set up to oppose the building of the second runway, the felling of nearby trees on land owned by the National Trust in Styal, Cheshire and air transportation in general. Camps were set up in Flywood, Arthur&#x27;s Wood and Cedar&#x27;s Wood. Swampy, a well known activist, was among many protesters.

The south west end of the new runway is closer to the town of Knutsford and to the village of Mobberley. There was initially an increase in noise experienced by local residents from the aircraft being lower and closer. All residents that were able to prove that their property had lost value, as a result of the operation of Runway 2, were compensated in 2010.
In 2012 Manchester Airports Group made a further, voluntary payment, to compensate those who felt aggrieved but had been unable to prove financial harm as a result of the operation of Runway 2. The precepts for Knutsford Town Council and Mobberley Parish Council residents were paid and money invested in local schools.

In 2007 Manchester Airport applied to build on land in Styal to increase its car parking. However, the former Macclesfield Borough Council refused to give them planning permission to do so and expressed annoyance at the airport for not investing enough in public transport.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 27 March 1951, a Douglas C-47A-75-DL Dakota 3 cargo aircraft operated by Air Transport Charter and en route to Nutts Corner, Antrim, Northern Ireland, crashed at Heyhead shortly after take-off from runway 06, following the aircraft&#x27;s failure to gain height. There were four fatalities – two of the three crew on board and two of the three passengers. The subsequent investigation found that the crash resulted from a loss of engine power, caused by ice forming in the carburettor intakes, attributable to the captain&#x27;s failure to use the heat controls. An extended undercarriage and snow on the wings may have also been contributory factors.
* On 14 March 1957, British European Airways Flight 411 operated by Vickers Viscount 701 (registration G-ALWE) inbound from Amsterdam crashed into houses in Shadow Moss Road, Woodhouse Park. The aircraft was on final approach to Runway 24 at Manchester Airport and the crash was due to a flap failure, caused by fatigue of a wing bolt. All 20 occupants on board died, as did two on the ground.
* On 4 June 1967, a British Midland International Canadair C-4 Argonaut (registration G-ALHG) was inbound from Palma and crashed near the centre of Stockport after loss of engine power due to fuel problems and an aborted approach to Manchester Airport, with 72 fatalities.
* On 20 March 1969, Vickers Viscount G-AVJA of British Midland International crashed on take-off. Three of the four people on board were killed.
* On 22 August 1985, an engine of a Boeing 737–236 Advanced, operated by British Airtours, failed during take-off from runway 24, the fire spreading into the cabin, resulting in 55 fatalities (mostly from smoke inhalation) aboard the Boeing 737–236 Advanced G-BGJL. The uncontained engine failure was later traced to an incorrectly repaired combustor causing the turbine disc to shatter and puncture the wing fuel tanks. As a result, fire resistance and evacuation procedures were improved.

==Runway visitor park==

Manchester Airport has had public viewing areas since the airport opened to the public in 1938. The 1960/1970s pier-top viewing facilities have been closed because of security concerns. In May 1992, an official &quot;Aviation Viewing Park&quot; (AVP) was created just off the A538 road on the south-western side of the airfield. This was moved to the western side of the airfield in May 1997 to allow construction of the second runway. Renamed the &quot;Runway Visitor Park&quot; in June 2010, the facility is regarded as providing the best official viewing facilities for aircraft spotting at any major UK airport by aircraft enthusiasts. Visitors can view aircraft taking off and landing from both runways and aircraft taxiing to and from the runways. This attraction now draws around 300,000 visitors a year and is one of Greater Manchester&#x27;s top 10 attractions.

The Runway Visitor Park is also home to a small number of retired aircraft exhibits. These currently are:
*Avro RJX100 Prototype (Registration: G-IRJX). This was the last British-built jetliner. It was delivered in 2001 from the nearby, but now-demolished Woodford Aerodrome. It was the first exhibit to be added to the park.
*British Airways Concorde (Registration: G-BOAC &#x27;Alpha Charlie&#x27;). Was acquired shortly after the retirement of the British Airways Concorde fleet in 2003. It has since been enclosed in a purpose-built hangar with a conference centre hosting regular events. This particular aircraft was the flagship of the British Airways fleet due to its G-BOAC designation, a reference to BOAC – a forerunner airline to British Airways.
*Front Fuselage of Monarch Airlines DC-10-30 (Registration: G-DMCA). This was the only DC-10 operated by now-defunct Monarch Airlines, operating between 1996–2001. The original complete airframe was held at Manchester for a short while after being retired and subsequently scrapped, the front section being moved to the park in 2003. It is the only remains of a DC-10 in the UK.
*BEA Trident 3 (Registration: G-AWZK). This aircraft last flew in 1985 and had been used for tug and de-ice training at Heathrow Airport. It was moved to the park in 2004, and opened to visitors in 2007. It is both the oldest and longest retired of all the exhibits.
*RAF Nimrod MR2 (Registration: XV231). First deployed in the 1970s and retired in the late 2000s. This aircraft was used in specialist search and rescue missions. It had been deployed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was flown into Manchester and put on display in 2010. It is the only military exhibit.

<text>Kastellorizo or Castellorizo ( ; ), officially Megisti (), is a Greek island and municipality of the Dodecanese in the Eastern Mediterranean. It lies roughly off the south coast of Turkey, about southeast of Athens and east of Rhodes, almost halfway between Rhodes and Antalya, and northwest of Cyprus. Kastellorizo is part of the Rhodes regional unit.

The island has become very popular in recent years among tourists looking for an isolated place in the Dodecanese, thanks also to the 1991 Oscar-winning movie &quot;Mediterraneo&quot;, by Gabriele Salvatores, which is set on the island during the Second World War.

==Name and etymology==
The island&#x27;s official name, &quot;Megisti&quot; (Μεγίστη) means &quot;biggest&quot; or &quot;greatest&quot;, but at only in area, it is the smallest of the Dodecanese. The name refers to the fact that it is the largest of the small archipelago. This name was used in antiquity, but is now rarely used in Greek, the name &quot;Kastellórizo&quot; (Καστελλόριζο) being common since the 12th century. There are several hypotheses about the origin of this name. &quot;Kastello&quot; derives from the Italian word &quot;castello&quot;, meaning &quot;castle&quot;. There is some argument on the second part of the name. The arguments are centered on the following possible origins of the element &quot;rizo&quot;:
#&quot;rizo&quot; being derived from the Italian word &quot;rosso&quot; meaning &quot;red&quot;, either from the reddish color of the rocks of the island, the reddish color of the castle at sunset, or the color of the coat of arms of the Great Master of the Knights of Rhodes, Juan Fernández de Heredia, which stood above the gate of the castle; these arguments are widely discredited as the rocks on the island have no red pigment and the name Kastellorizo predates the Knights&#x27; arrival.
#&quot;rizo&quot; being a corruption of the word &quot;Rhoge&quot;, one of the ancient appellations of the nearby island of Ro. If this is correct, the island&#x27;s modern name is actually an amalgam of the separate island names &quot;Castello&quot; and &quot;Rhoge&quot;.
#&quot;rizo&quot; being the actual Greek word &quot;rizon&quot; meaning &quot;root&quot;, as researched by Greek Historian I.M. Hatzifotis (1996), to signify the foothill or &#x27;rizovouno&#x27; on which the island&#x27;s original castle was built.
It has gone by several different names in its history, including &quot;Kastellorizo&quot; (Greek), &quot;Castellorizo&quot; (Greek name with Italian spelling), (Italian, meaning &quot;Red Castle&quot;), &quot;Château Rouge&quot; (French translation of Italian name: but possibly the Italian name is a calque of , an ancient possession of the Knights Hospitaller in Syria) and or , both Turkish, the former deriving from the island&#x27;s official name in Greek, the latter meaning &quot;Red Castle&quot;, a translation of the Italian name.

==Physical geography==
Kastellorizo is (with the exception of the nearby islet of Strongyli) the easternmost Greek island and is situated in the Levantine Sea. It is the largest island of the homonym archipelago comprising the islands and islets of Agios Georgios, Agrielaia, Voutsakia, Megalo Mavro Poini, Mikro Mavro Poini, Polifados Ena, Polifados Dio, Ro, Savoura, Stroggili, Tragonera, Psomi and Psoradia. It lies about from the Anatolian coastal town of Kaş, more or less halfway between Rhodes and Antalya. Cyprus is about to the south-east. It is six kilometres () long and three kilometres () wide, with a surface of . It has a triangular shape, and is oriented from north-east to south-west. The island features three capes: Agios Stefanos (north), Nifti (east) and Pounenti (south west); between the first two there is a wide and accommodating bay, the island&#x27;s main harbor, where one finds the only town on the island. Cape Agios Stefanos, the nearest to Anatolia, is south of the modern Turkish town of Kaş (Greek: &quot;Andífli&quot;, the Ancient Greek City of &quot;Antiphéllos&quot;). Cape Nifti lies some greater distance from the Anatolian coast. The island is mountainous, with high and steep coastlines, which become more difficult to access moving west. The soil is composed of limestone and produces only small amounts of olives, grapes and beans. On the island there is no source of drinking water. The Municipality of Megísti includes the offshore islands of Ro and Strongyli as well as several smaller islets. It has a total land area of .

=== Nearby islands between Turkey and Kastellorizo ===

There are many islets in this area; &quot;Volos&quot;, near Kalkan (in Greek &quot;Kalamaki&quot;), &quot;Ochendra&quot;, &quot;Furnachia&quot;, &quot;Prassonisi&quot;, &quot;Ro&quot;, &quot;Tragonera&quot;, &quot;Marathi&quot;, &quot;Strongyli&quot;, &quot;Dhassia&quot;, &quot;Alimentaria&quot;, &quot;Kekova and Psomi&quot; besides many rocks and cliffs. The most important among these islets is Kekova (also named &quot;Caravola&quot;), not inhabited, which has an area of and faces the Turkish village of &quot;Kaleköy&quot; (Simena in antiquity).

All these islets were subject to dispute between Italy and Turkey until 1932. According to the 1932 Convention between Italy and Turkey all these islets except Ro, Strongyli and Psomi were assigned to Turkey.

The group of islands that includes Kastellorizo, Ro and Strongyli is very important to the Exclusive economic zone of Greece, since it is the easternmost territory of Greece and according to UNCLOS as well as customary international law, Greece can claim a large part of the Eastern Mediterranean basin. 

== Geography ==


The houses of the town are slender and characterised by wooden balconies and windows of the Anatolian type. Behind the waterfront, many houses are still in a ruinous state. At the entrance to the harbour, on the east side, stand the single-story remnants of the former Italian government house (&quot;palazzina della delegazione&quot;), erected in 1926 by the Italian architect Florestano Di Fausto, who also designed some of the most important buildings of the Italian period in Rhodes. Nearby is the island&#x27;s former Ottoman mosque which dates from the second half of the 18th century and which has been restored and re-opened as a museum since 2007. From here starts the town&#x27;s quay, which runs along all three sides of the harbour. The central square — &quot;Plateia Ethelondon Kastellórizou&quot; (&quot;Kastellorizo Volunteers&#x27; Square&quot;) — lies at the midpoint of the eastern side, near the vessel dock. On the opposite side of the harbour one has a good view from this vantage of &quot;Pera Meria&quot;, the western quay, and the monasteries of &quot;Profitis Ilías&quot; and &quot;Aghia Triadha&quot;, the former now an army base.

Above the quay on the eastern side is a pathway which leads to the &quot;Castle of the Knights&quot; (14th century). Of it remain the curtain wall, part of a square tower, the remains of a cylindrical tower at the east corner, and toward the sea another cylindrical tower. A Doric inscription, carved in the rock, attests to the existence of an earlier fortress here during Antiquity. Inside the tower there is a large covered cistern.

Ascending the steps on the eastern side of the town, one reaches the suburb of &quot;Horafia&quot;, where there is a square surrounded by the Church of St. George (1906), with a high dome of Byzantine type, and the Cathedral of Saints Constantine and Helena (1835). It has three naves divided by monolithic granite columns from the temple of Apollo Lykios in Patara (Anatolia). The columns carry ogival arches. Further east is the small bay known as &quot;Mandraki&quot;, the secondary harbour of the island.

West of the town, beyond the summit of the island known as &quot;Vigla&quot; (270 m), stands &quot;Palaiokastro&quot; (old castle), the island&#x27;s ancient acropolis. This fortified elevation has classical origins (see below, history section): its plan is rectangular and measures . In its interior stand an ancient tower, built with square limestone blocks, and large water cisterns. Carved on the base of the castle there is also a Doric inscription, dating back to the 4th or 3rd centuries BC, with references to &quot;Megiste&quot; (the ancient name of Kastellorizo) and its dependence on Rhodes. On the east side there are remnants of a gateway, or propylaea.

Since August 2020 the island also features an interactive Puzzle Museum, the first of its kind in Greece and one of the very few in the world.

===Climate===
Kastellorizo has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). It has hot dry summers and exceptionally mild winters by European standards. Like in the Azores, average lows do not drop below 12.0 °C during the coldest months. According to the National Observatory of Athens station the lowest temperature ever recorded in coastal Kastellorizo is 4.5 °C and was recorded on 25 January 2022. Kastellorizo records on average 156 tropical nights per year and falls in 11a hardiness zone. After Lindos, the island records the highest average annual temperature in Greece with 21.9 °C.

===Geology===
The island&#x27;s geology is almost exclusively limestone laid down at the Mesozoic/Cenozoic boundary. As a result of the lack of significant flora covering the island, the landscape shows many features of karstification. There are a number of notable sea caves including the so-called Blue Grotto which is much larger than its namesake in Capri. Exploration undertaken in 2006 by members of the SELAS Caving club of Greece has revealed vertical caves in many parts of the island. The deepest found so far was surveyed to a depth of in March 2006 and will be the subject of further exploration in the future by the same team.

==History==
===Ancient period===
The island was colonised by Dorian Greeks, who named it &quot;Megiste&quot;. In antiquity it was known both as Megiste and Cisthene (Κισθήνη), but in later times only as Megiste. The Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax says that the island belonged to the Rhodians. In addition, inscriptions found at the foot of the Knight&#x27;s castle confirm that during the Hellenistic period the island was ruled by Rhodes, and formed part of its Peraia. The Rhodians sent an overseer, or &quot;epistates&quot;, to monitor events on the island.

The three towers of Kastellorizo, Ro and Strongyli comprise the main links in a dense network of watchtowers constructed by the Rhodians during the Hellenistic period, to control the sea routes and the coast. Palaiokastro was (and still is) the main and largest fortified site on the island.

===Byzantine era===
During the period of the Byzantine Empire, Kastellorizo was part of the &quot;Province of the Islands&quot;, the capital of which was Rhodes.

===Knights Hospitaller period===
In 1306 the island was taken over by the Knights Hospitaller, headed by Foulques de Villaret, as part of their expedition to conquer the island of Rhodes, which became the centre of their Crusader State. They restored the castle, which was thereafter used as a prison for disobedient knights. Around 1440 the island was occupied by sultan Sayf ad-Din Jaqmaq of Egypt, who destroyed the castle. Ten years later it was conquered by Alfonso V of Aragon, king of Naples, who in 1461 rebuilt the castle and dispatched a Catalan governor.

===Ottoman era===
The Crown of Aragon retained possession of it until 1512, when it was conquered by Ottoman Sultan Suleiman I.

On 22 September 1659, during the Siege of Candia, the island was conquered by Venice and the castle was destroyed again, but the Ottomans were able to regain it again soon after. Between 1828 and 1833 Kastellórizo joined the Greek insurgents, but after the end of the Greek War of Independence it came back into the possession of the Ottoman Empire.

According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Kastellorizo (Meyis) had a total population of 4,871, consisting of 4,635 Greeks, 225 Muslims, 6 Jews and 5 foreign citizens.

In 1912, during the Libyan war between Italy and the Ottoman Empire, the inhabitants asked Giovanni Battista Ameglio, chief of the Italian occupation forces in Rhodes, for their island to be annexed to Italy. This was refused, and on 14 March 1913 the local population imprisoned the governor and his Ottoman garrison and proclaimed a provisional government. In August 1913, the Greek government sent from Samos a provisional governor supported by gendarmes, but in early 1914 in Florence it was decided that the island would be returned to the Ottoman Empire.

===World War I===

During World War I, while the Kingdom of Greece was still neutral, French Navy warships led by the cruiser &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; occupied Kastellorizo on 28 December 1915 at the behest of local inhabitants who feared Ottoman reprisals. The French quickly blocked another landing attempted on the same day by a Hellenic Army detachment of Evzones. Ottoman shore batteries responded to the French occupation by shelling the island in 1917, which resulted in the sinking of the British Royal Navy seaplane carrier HMS &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot;.

===Italian period===
In the Treaty of Sèvres the island was assigned to Italy and the Italian navy assumed it from the French on 1 March 1921, but the treaty was never ratified. The Treaty of Lausanne confirmed the Italian claim on Kastellorizo, and the island – under the Italian name &quot;Castelrosso&quot; – was then integrated in the possession of the &quot;Isole Italiane dell&#x27;Egeo&quot;.

Because of the Italian occupation, the island was not affected directly by the population exchange between Greece and Turkey of 1923, but the forced emigration of the large Greek population living on the nearby Anatolian coast hit heavily the economy of the island.

The 1932 Convention between Italy and Turkey, which defined the sea border between the two powers, assigned all the islets of the small archipelago around Kastellorizo except Ro and Strongyli to Turkey. During the 1930s it was a stopover for French and British seaplanes. During the Second World War, on 25 February 1941, in the course of Operation Abstention, British Commandos occupied the island, but Italian forces from Rhodes recaptured it some days later. After the British occupation, fearing a German invasion, some of the inhabitants fled to Gaza in Palestine. When Italy capitulated to the Allies (8 September 1943), the island was occupied again by Allied forces, and it remained under their occupation for the rest of the war. In July 1944, a fuel dump caught fire, which spread to an adjacent ammunition dump, thereby destroying half of the homes on the island.

===Modern Greek era===
Kastellorizo was assigned to Greece with the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. In May 1945 it was still under British administration, but on 15 September 1947 effectively came under Greek administration. The island formally joined the Greek State on 7 March 1948 together with the other Dodecanese islands.

The island has become more popular in recent years, among tourists looking for an isolated place in the Dodecanese, thanks also to the 1991 Oscar-winning movie &quot;Mediterraneo&quot;, by Gabriele Salvatores, which is set on the island. Kastellórizo was the only territory of the European Union where the solar eclipse of March 29, 2006, was visible in its totality.

In 2011, the French ship &quot;Dignité-Al Karama&quot;, the only member the Freedom Flotilla II that managed to approach Gaza, refueled at Kastellorizo.

==Demographics and economy==
The population rose from 4,870 in the 1880s and reached its peak in 1908 with an estimated 9,000 people residing there. At that time, Kastellorizo was still the only safe harbor along the route between Makri (today&#x27;s Fethiye) and Beirut. Its sailing ships traded products from Anatolia (coal, timber, valonia, pine bark) for Egyptian goods (rice, sugar, coffee, tissues and yarns), and carried Anatolian cereals to Rhodes and Cyprus. On the island there was also a flourishing production of charcoal (much sought after in Alexandria, where it was used for narghile). The fishing industry — mainly sea sponges — was important too.

After 1908, the decay of the island&#x27;s economy set in, accelerated by the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. In the late 1920s the island&#x27;s population dropped to 3,000, while about 8,000 inhabitants lived abroad, predominantly in Australia, Egypt, Greece and the U.S. At that time the town had 730 inhabited houses, while 675 were already empty, and many ruined.

The population continued to drop to 584 at the 1951 census, reaching a low point of 222 at the 1981 census, before slowly rising again to 584 at the 2021 census, all living in the town of Megísti. The municipality also includes the islands of Ro and Strongyli, both without permanent inhabitants. Many of its emigrants live in Australia (especially Perth and Sydney), where they are known as &quot;Kazzies&quot;.

The existence of a Muslim community on the island during the Ottoman period can be deduced from the presence of a mosque with a minaret that still exists but by 1929 was no longer functioning.

==Transport==
The island is connected with Rhodes, Piraeus and Kaş by ferry. Passenger ferries&#x27; frequency is as follows:
*Kastellorizo - Rhodes - Symi - Tilos - Nisyros - Kalymnos - Piraeus: 2 trips / week (winter period)
*Kastellorizo - Kaş: 1 trip / week (winter period)
Air connection is provided by Olympic Air, which operates from Kastellorizo Airport 4 times/week (winter period). There is one small bus in service on Kastellorizo, and it is used to collect tourists from the airport.

==Culture==
Kastellorizo&#x27;s inhabitants had characteristic traditions, partly influenced by the Muslim tradition. There were at least three types of women&#x27;s dress, which used brilliantly colored fabric, and women wore necklaces, brooches, pendants and earrings made from ancient Venetian or Byzantine gold coins.

The women&#x27;s festive dress consisted of:
*One or more long silk blouses (&quot;ipokámiso&quot;). The most external one was closed on the front by six large filigreed gold or silver buttons. These buttons were shaped as a half-sphere depressed in the middle. From the lowest one was hung a small chain with a cross;
*A pair of short pants (&quot;katofóri&quot;) whose lower part was made with good quality material quilted with gold thread;
*A sleeved jacket (&quot;zepuni&quot;) made with brilliant colored silk or velvet, opened at the front;
*Another long underskirt (&quot;kavadi&quot;), laced with gold thread, also opened at the front;
*A large scarf (&quot;zosma&quot;) made with three or four silk strips, quilted with gold or silver thread. It was tied very low on the sides, like a loose belt;
*A large velvet coat (&quot;gunna&quot;) decorated with gold and silver lace on the hems and on the back, with *fur lapels: It was always kept open;
*A woolen cap;
*A quadrangular wrinkled silken shawl (&quot;mandili&quot;), decorated with relief flowers and fringed hems, coloured in white, red and deep blue. Folded diagonally, it was fixed above the cap, with its longest angle falling on the back almost to the ground, while the side edges were folded on the front or put over the shoulders;
*The socks were woven with multicolored wool or silk;
*The shoes were shaped like tipped slippers, and were made of velvet or silk. They were laced with gold or silver thread and shorter than the foot;

The other types of dress were similar, but not so lavish and without fur decorations. The girls&#x27; dress was simpler. Single and engaged girls, and married women and widows were also distinguished by dress.

===Religion, customs and superstitions===
The engagement, which was decided by the parents, and the wedding, which lasted 15 days, occurred through prescribed and curious ceremonies, having symbolic and poetic meaning. Weddings were celebrated on Sunday, in the church of &quot;Agios Konstantinos&quot;, and an announcement on the main square invited the whole city to participate. Also baptisms and funerals (with mourning women, or &quot;praeficae&quot;, and a dish with oil and wine crushed on the coffin) had well-established rituals.

On December 31 and on New Year&#x27;s Day, groups of children carrying small cardboard boats adorned with ribbons and small flags go around visiting houses, stores and coffee shops, singing songs with good wishes and receiving coins and wheat cakes, while the elderly exchange visits. On the morning of &quot;Agios Basilios&quot; day, coming back from Liturgy, the men customarily throw a pomegranate hard against the walls of their homes, wishing for abundance and happiness for their family. The more seeds that are spread around the rooms, the more luck the family will have in the coming year.

The day before the feast of Agios Elias on July 19 (the feast itself is on July 20) first the children and then the men jump into the sea, and wear their wet clothes the whole day. Those who do not want to participate are sometimes forced to do so.

On Easter, the Liturgy of the Resurrection takes place in the open at midnight, the faithful bearing candles. As soon as the bells start ringing, the young people let off fireworks, and the people tell each other the ritual words &quot;Christ is resurrected&quot;. Then everyone enters the church and lights his candle from the holy fire held by the priest, and then goes home to light the fire in the fireplace. On Easter Monday the whole population gathers in the main square, and they remain there the whole day eating, drinking and singing. In the past single girls had to stay at home, but they were allowed to stay in the entrance, where they sang and played with swings.

On May 1, at dawn, all the girls of the island, in groups, each one carrying a jar, went to get water outside of town, but they were not allowed to speak a single word during the route. This water (&quot;Amilito Neró&quot;, &quot;water of silence&quot;) was supposed to bring good luck to the family. Everyone washed him/herself with it that day, and every utensil and wall of the house was splashed with it. When a girl became engaged, she filled a crystal carafe with it and brought it to her future mother-in-law, who gave her in return a special cake and an odd number of gold coins.

When a child became seriously ill, a woman with knowledge of prayers against the evil eye was invited to her/his home. She drew signs of the cross on the body of the child with a thurible filled with embers and branches of the olive tree which had been gathered in the church on Palm Sunday, pronouncing the following words: &quot;Christ came: then he laid down his stick and chased away the snake and the bad neighbor from our home&quot;. After this exorcism, the woman would throw the content of the thurible into a bucket filled with water, and then count the pieces of wood which did not burn. This number was said to be equal to the number of persons who were supposed to have enchanted the sick child. The enchantment of the child was sure, if the olive leaves burned with a loud crackling sound.

When a man was going to emigrate, gentle, sorrowful songs were sung to him by his friends.

==Notable people==

* Perth, Western Australia, Australia
* Antalya, Turkey

==Cinema and popular culture==

In the 1961 film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, a saboteur team led by Anthony Quayle is briefed on its mission at Castelrosso. The Italian 1991 movie &quot;Mediterraneo&quot; was filmed on the island.

Kastellorizo also lends its name to David Gilmour&#x27;s instrumental track &quot;Castellorizon&quot; from his album &quot;On an Island&quot; (2006). He stayed on the island in the early 1990s with his wife, Polly Samson, and many close friends. The music reflects the memories of the time spent there, and is a tribute to the friends who have since died.

<text>Sir Robert Brackenbury (died 22 August 1485) was an English courtier, who was Constable of the Tower of London during the reign of Richard III. He is believed to have been responsible for enabling the (presumed) murders of the Princes in the Tower, though there is no conclusive evidence to prove it. He died defending the King at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.

==Early life==
His date of birth is unknown. He was a younger son of Thomas Brackenbury of Denton, County Durham, England. This was a family which had been known in Durham since the end of the 12th century. They were lords of the manors of Burne Hall, Denton and Saleby. Robert inherited Saleby; in the immediate vicinity of Barnard Castle. Barnard Castle had passed to the Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) in the right of his wife, Anne Neville in about 1474. Richard III and Brackenbury, were therefore, close neighbours. Indeed, a tower of Barnard Castle is still called Brackenbury Tower.

==Royal service==
Brackenbury was one of Richard III&#x27;s close associates. He was treasurer of Richard&#x27;s household when he was Duke of Gloucester. When King Edward IV died Brackenbury was almost certainly one of the Northerners who accompanied Richard to London. Shortly after Richard took the throne Brackenbury received a number of appointments, including Constable of the Tower of London. After the collapse of the Buckingham Revolt he was rewarded with large grants of land in the south-east of England forfeited by Rivers and the Cheney family and in 1484 was appointed sheriff of Kent.

Brackenbury remained Constable of the Tower and on 17 July 1483 he was appointed Constable of the Tower for life. He was also given the very lucrative post of Master of the King&#x27;s Moneys and Keeper of the Exchange, that is, Master of the Mint after the execution of William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, the previous incumbent. Many other honours and duties were laid on him. In March 1485 he was entrusted with Richard&#x27;s bastard son, John of Gloucester, whom he took to Calais to become its captain. In May he was placed in command of the defence of London. His income must have exceeded £500 per year – more than many Barons. He must have been better rewarded than all but three or four of the household. Between August 1484 and January 1485 he was knighted.

Brackenbury seems to have been a man of popularity and wide learning. The Italian poet Pietro Carmeliano, dedicated one of his Latin works to him.

==Brackenbury and the Princes in the Tower==
As Constable of the Tower of London, Brackenbury inevitably figures in any account of the fate of Richard III&#x27;s nephews, the Princes in the Tower.

For example, in Thomas More&#x27;s version of the life of Richard III, More says that after the coronation on 6 July 1483 and while on his way to Gloucester, Richard sent John Green to Brackenbury with written orders for Brackenbury to kill the princes. Brackenbury, says More, replied &quot;that he would never put them to death, though he should die therefore&quot;. So Richard then ordered Sir James Tyrrell to go to Brackenbury with a letter by which he was commanded to deliver to Sir James all the keys of the Tower for one night, &quot;to the end he might there accomplish the King&#x27;s pleasure&quot;.

==Tudor invasion and death==

In 1485, when news arrived that Henry Tudor had landed in Wales he was ordered to escort Lords Hungerford and Bourchier to Leicester but en route they escaped.

When Richard III marched against the invader, Brackenbury hurried himself to reach the King and arrived two days before the Battle of Bosworth Field (22 August 1485), in which – according to Molinet and Lindsay – he had joint command of Richard&#x27;s vanguard; he took part in the final charge on Henry and was killed by Sir Walter Hungerford of Farleigh fighting beside Richard III.

On 7 November 1485, Brackenbury was posthumously attainted by Henry VII. In a document antedating Henry Tudor&#x27;s rule, Brackenbury was charged with having &quot;assembled to them at Leicester ... a great host, traitorously intending, imagining and conspiring the destruction of the king&#x27;s royal person, our sovereign liege lord&quot;.

Brackenbury&#x27;s attainder was partly reversed in 1489 in favour of his sisters and bastard son, allowing them to recover the family lands but not the new grants from Richard III. Ralph, his nephew and heir male inherited Saleby.

<text>Bennett Lester Carter (August 8, 1907 – July 12, 2003) was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, trumpeter, composer, arranger, and bandleader. With Johnny Hodges, he was a pioneer on the alto saxophone. From the beginning of his career in the 1920s, he worked as an arranger including written charts for Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s big band that shaped the swing style. He had an unusually long career that lasted into the 1990s. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was nominated for eight Grammy Awards, which included receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Career==
Carter was born in New York City in 1907. He was given piano lessons by his mother and others in the neighborhood. He played trumpet and experimented briefly with C-melody saxophone before settling on alto saxophone. In the 1920s, he performed with June Clark, Billy Paige, and Earl Hines, then toured as a member of the Wilberforce Collegians led by Horace Henderson.
He appeared on record for the first time in 1927 as a member of the Paradise Ten led by Charlie Johnson. He returned to the Collegians and became their bandleader through 1929, including a performance at the Savoy Ballroom in New York City.

In his early 20s, Carter worked as arranger for Fletcher Henderson after that position was vacated by Don Redman. He had no formal education in arranging, learning by trial and error, getting on his knees and looking at the existing charts, &quot;writing the lead trumpet first and the lead saxophone first—which, of course, is the hard way. It was quite some time that I did that before I knew what a score was.&quot;

He left Henderson to take Redman&#x27;s former job as leader of McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers in Detroit. In 1932, he formed a band in New York City that included Chu Berry, Sid Catlett, Frankie Newton, Dicky Wells, Wayman Carver, and Teddy Wilson. Carter&#x27;s arrangements were complex. Among the most significant were &quot;Keep a Song in Your Soul&quot;, written for Henderson in 1930, and &quot;Lonesome Nights&quot; and &quot;Symphony in Riffs&quot; from 1933, both of which show Carter&#x27;s writing for saxophones.

By the early 1930s, Carter and Johnny Hodges were considered the leading alto saxophonists. Carter also became a leading trumpet soloist, having rediscovered the instrument. He recorded extensively on trumpet in the 1930s. Carter&#x27;s short-lived Orchestra played the Harlem Club in New York but only recorded a handful of records for Columbia, OKeh and Vocalion. The OKeh sides were issued under the name The Chocolate Dandies.

In 1933, Carter participated in sessions with British composer/musician Spike Hughes, who visited New York City to organize recordings with prominent African American musicians. These 14 sides plus four by Carter&#x27;s big band, titled at the time &quot;Spike Hughes and His Negro Orchestra&quot;, were initially only issued in England. The musicians were from Carter&#x27;s band and included Red Allen, Dicky Wells, Wayman Carver, Coleman Hawkins, J. C. Higginbotham, and Chu Berry.

Carter moved to London and spent two years as arranger for the BBC Big Band. In England, France, and Scandinavia he recorded with local musicians, and he took his band to the Netherlands. In these settings, Carter played trumpet, clarinet, piano, alto and tenor saxophone, and provided occasional vocals. In 1938, he recorded in Paris with Django Reinhardt &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Virginia&quot; and &quot;Farewell Blues&quot; in his own arrangement. He returned to America that same year and found regular work leading his band at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem through 1941. The band included Shad Collins, Sidney De Paris, Vic Dickenson, and Freddie Webster. After this engagement, he led a seven-piece band which included Eddie Barefield, Kenny Clarke, and Dizzy Gillespie.

In the mid-1940s he moved to Los Angeles, forming another big band, which at times included J. J. Johnson, Max Roach, and Miles Davis. But these would be his last big bands. With the exception of occasional concerts, performing with Jazz at the Philharmonic, and recording, he ceased working as a touring big band bandleader. Los Angeles provided him many opportunities for studio work, and these dominated his time during the decades. He wrote music and arrangements for films, such as &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; in 1943. During the 1950s and &#x27;60s, he wrote arrangements for vocalists such as Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, and Sarah Vaughan. On something of a comeback in the 1970s, Carter returned to playing saxophone again and toured the Middle East courtesy of the U.S. State Department. He began making annual visits to Europe and Japan.
In 1969, Carter was persuaded to spend a weekend at Princeton University by Morroe Berger, a sociology professor at Princeton who wrote about jazz. This led to a new outlet for Carter&#x27;s talent: teaching. For the next nine years he visited Princeton five times, most of them brief stays except for one in 1973 when he spent a semester there as a visiting professor. In 1974, Princeton gave him an honorary doctorate. He conducted teaching at workshops and seminars at several other universities and was a visiting lecturer at Harvard for a week in 1987. Morroe Berger wrote &quot;Benny Carter – A Life in American Music&quot; (1982), a two-volume work about Carter&#x27;s career.

Time had little effect on Carter&#x27;s abilities. During the 1980s, he wrote the long composition &quot;Central City Sketches&quot; which was performed at Cooper Union by the American Jazz Orchestra. Another long composition, &quot;Glasgow Suite&quot;, was performed in Scotland. Lincoln Center commissioned him to write &quot;Good Vibes&quot; in 1990. The National Endowment for the Arts gave him a grant that led &quot;Tales of the Rising Sun Suite&quot; and &quot;Harlem Renaissance Suite&quot;. This music was performed in 1992 when he was 85 years old.

Carter had an unusually long career. He is one of few musicians to have recorded in eight different decades. Another characteristic of his career was its versatility as musician, bandleader, arranger, and composer. He helped define the sound of alto saxophone, but he also performed and recorded on soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, and piano. He helped establish a foundation for arranging as far back as 1930 when he arranged &quot;Keep a Song in Your Soul&quot; for Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s big band. His compositions include the novelty hit &quot;Cow-Cow Boogie&quot; recorded by Ella Mae Morse, and the expansive &quot;Central City Sketches&quot;, written when he was 80 years old and recorded with the American Jazz Orchestra.

==Death==
Carter died at the age of 95 in Los Angeles at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on July 12, 2003, from complications of bronchitis.

==Awards and honors==
He was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame in 1977. In 1978, he was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. In 1980, he received the Golden Score award of the American Society of Music Arrangers and Composers. His 75th birthday was commemorated by a radio station in New York that played his music nonstop for over a week. The National Endowment for the Arts gave him the NEA Jazz Masters Award for 1986.

He was given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987. In 1994 he won a Grammy Award for his solo on &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot; and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 1989, Lincoln Center celebrated Carter&#x27;s 82nd birthday with a set of his songs sung by Ernestine Anderson and Sylvia Syms. In 1990, he was named Jazz Artist of the Year in the &quot;DownBeat&quot; and &quot;JazzTimes&quot; polls. He was a Kennedy Center Honoree in 1996 and received honorary doctorates from Princeton (1974), Rutgers (1991), Harvard (1994), and the New England Conservatory of Music (1998). In 2016, the National Museum of American History made Carter the subject of its Jazz Appreciation Month poster.

In 2000, he was given the National Medal of Arts by President Bill Clinton.

<text>Sir Richard Ratcliffe, KG (died 22 August 1485) was a close confidant of Richard III of England.

==Life==
Ratcliffe came from a gentry family in the Lake District, and became a companion of Richard when the latter was still Duke of Gloucester (1461–83). He was one of Richard&#x27;s trustees in the lordship of Richmond, and was named steward of Barnard Castle. Richard, while Duke of Gloucester, knighted Ratcliffe during the Scottish campaigns, at the same time creating him a knight banneret.

During the ascension to power by Richard III, Ratcliffe was chosen to return to the north and organize an army to help the Protector, as Richard III was then titled. Some sources name Ratcliffe as the person who gave the order to execute Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers (beheaded Jun 1483).

When Richard became king he gave Ratcliffe a number of offices, including the currently attainted hereditary High Sheriff of Westmorland, and made him a Knight of the Garter. He also received a large grant of lands, including much that had belonged to the Courtenay Earls of Devon. After the rebellion of 1483 he was given a very large number of forfeited estates. As a result, he had an income larger than most barons.

In July 1484, William Collingbourne, a Tudor agent, nailed a lampooning poem to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, which obliquely identifies Ratcliffe as one of the three aides to King Richard:

The &quot;catte&quot; alludes to William Catesby; the &quot;ratte&quot; to Ratcliffe; and &quot;Lovell&quot; to Francis, Viscount Lovell, one of whose heraldic family devices was a white wolf (the &quot;dogge&quot;). The &quot;hogge&quot; alludes to King Richard and his badge of a white boar. The poem was interpolated into Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film &quot;Richard III&quot;, a screen adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play.

Ratcliffe married Agnes Scrope, daughter of Henry Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton, one of the great barons in the north of England.
Ratcliffe was one of the two councillors (the other was William Catesby) who are reputed to have told the king that marrying Elizabeth of York would cause rebellions in the north.

Ratcliffe was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field, on 22 August 1485.

==Shakespeare play==
Ratcliffe appears in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot; as a minor character who executes Rivers, Grey and Vaughn. In the Andrew Wise 1597 (first) edition, Sir Richard&#x27;s character appears first as &quot;Sir Richard Ratliffe&quot; (without the &#x27;c&#x27;) then as plain &quot;Ratcliffe&quot; (with the &#x27;c&#x27;, but no &#x27;Sir&#x27; nor &#x27;Richard&#x27;) and finally as plain &quot;Ratliffe&quot;.

In the 1995 film version (starring Ian McKellen, and adapted to a 1930s setting), Ratcliffe is portrayed by Bill Paterson, and acts as (King) Richard&#x27;s batman.

<text>William Ashley Sunday (November 19, 1862 – November 6, 1935) was an American evangelist and professional baseball outfielder. He played for eight seasons in the National League before becoming the most influential American preacher during the first two decades of the 20th century.

Born into poverty near Ames, Iowa, Sunday spent some years at the Iowa Soldiers&#x27; Orphans&#x27; Home before working at odd jobs and playing for local running and baseball teams. His speed and agility provided him the opportunity to play baseball in the major leagues for eight years.

Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left baseball for the Christian ministry. During the early 20th century, he became the nation&#x27;s most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America&#x27;s largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist before the advent of electronic sound systems. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919. Though his audiences grew smaller during the 1920s, Sunday continued to preach and promote conservative Christianity until his death.

==Early life==
Billy Sunday was born near Ames, Iowa. His father, William Sunday, was the son of a German Americans named Sonntag, who had anglicized their name to &quot;Sunday&quot; when they settled in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.William Sunday was a bricklayer who worked his way to Iowa, where he married Mary Jane Corey, daughter of &quot;Squire&quot; Martin Corey, a local farmer, miller, blacksmith, and wheelwright. William Sunday enlisted in the Iowa Twenty-Third Volunteer Infantry on August 14, 1862. He died four months later of pneumonia at an army camp in Patterson, Missouri, five weeks after the birth of his youngest son, William Ashley. Mary Jane Sunday and her children moved in with her parents for a few years, and young Billy became close to his grandparents and especially his grandmother. Mary Jane Sunday later remarried, but her second husband soon deserted the family.

When Billy Sunday was ten years old, his impoverished mother sent him and an older brother to the Soldiers&#x27; Orphans Home in Glenwood, Iowa, and later to the Iowa Soldiers&#x27; Orphans&#x27; Home in Davenport, Iowa. At the orphanage, Sunday gained orderly habits, a decent primary education, and the realization that he was a good athlete.

By fourteen, Sunday was shifting for himself. In Nevada, Iowa, he worked for Colonel John Scott, a former lieutenant governor, tending Shetland ponies and doing other farm chores. The Scotts provided Sunday a good home and the opportunity to attend Nevada High School. Although Sunday never received a high school diploma, by 1880 he was better educated than many of his contemporaries.

In 1880, Sunday relocated to Marshalltown, Iowa, where, because of his athleticism, he had been recruited for a fire brigade team. In Marshalltown, Sunday worked at odd jobs, competed in fire brigade tournaments, and played for the town baseball team.

==Professional baseball player==
Sunday&#x27;s professional baseball 
career was launched by Cap Anson, a Marshalltown native and future Hall of Famer, after his aunt, an avid fan of the Marshalltown team, gave him an enthusiastic account of Sunday&#x27;s prowess. In 1883, on Anson&#x27;s recommendation, A.G. Spalding, president of the Chicago White Stockings, signed Sunday to the defending National League champions.

Sunday struck out four times in his first game, and there were seven more strikeouts and three more games before he got a hit. During his first four seasons with Chicago, he was a part-time player, taking Mike &quot;King&quot; Kelly&#x27;s place in right field when Kelly served as catcher.

Sunday&#x27;s speed was his greatest asset, and he displayed it both on the basepaths and in the outfield. In 1885, the White Stockings arranged a race between Sunday and Arlie Latham, the fastest runner in the American Association. Sunday won the hundred-yard dash by about ten feet.

Sunday&#x27;s personality, demeanor, and athleticism made him popular with the fans, as well as with his teammates. Manager Cap Anson considered Sunday reliable enough to make him the team&#x27;s business manager, which included such duties as handling the ticket receipts and paying the team&#x27;s travel expenses.

In 1887, when Kelly was sold to another team, Sunday became Chicago&#x27;s regular right fielder, but an injury limited his playing time to fifty games. During the following winter Sunday was sold to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys for the 1888 season. He was their starting center fielder, playing a full season for the first time in his career. The crowds in Pittsburgh took to Sunday immediately; one reporter wrote that &quot;the whole town is wild over Sunday.&quot; Although Pittsburgh had a losing team during the 1888 and 1889 seasons, Sunday performed well in center field and was among the league leaders in stolen bases.

In 1890, a labor dispute led to the formation of a new league, composed of most of the better players from the National League. Although he was invited to join the competing league, Sunday&#x27;s conscience would not allow him to break the reserve clause, which allowed Pittsburgh to retain the rights to Sunday after his contract expired. Sunday was named team captain, and he was their star player, but the team suffered one of the worst seasons in baseball history. By August the team had no money to meet its payroll, and Sunday was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.

The Philadelphia team had an opportunity to win the National League pennant, and the owners hoped that adding Sunday to the roster would improve their chances. Although Sunday played well in his thirty-one games with Philadelphia, the team finished in third place.

In March 1891, Sunday requested and was granted a release from his contract with the Philadelphia ball club. Over his career, Sunday was never much of a hitter: his batting average was .248 over 499 games, about the median for the 1880s. In his best season, in 1887, Sunday hit .291, ranking 17th in the league. He was an exciting but inconsistent fielder. In the days before outfielders wore gloves, Sunday was noted for thrilling catches featuring long sprints and athletic dives, but he also committed a great many errors. Sunday was best known as an exciting base-runner, regarded by his peers as one of the fastest in the game, even though he never placed better than third in the National League in stolen bases.

Sunday remained a prominent baseball fan throughout his life. He gave interviews and opinions about baseball to the popular press; he frequently umpired minor league and amateur games in the cities where he held revivals; and he attended baseball games whenever he could, including a 1935 World Series game two months before he died.

==Conversion==
On a Sunday afternoon in Chicago, during either the 1886 or 1887 baseball season, Sunday and several of his teammates were out on the town on their day off. At one street corner, they stopped to listen to a gospel preaching team from the Pacific Garden Mission. Attracted by the hymns he had heard his mother sing, Sunday began attending services at the mission. After talking with a former society matron who worked there, Sundayafter some struggle on his partdecided to become a Christian. He began attending the fashionable Jefferson Park Presbyterian Church, a congregation close to both the ball park and his rented room.

Although he socialized with his teammates and sometimes gambled, Sunday was never a heavy drinker. In his autobiography, he said, &quot;I was never drunk but four times in my life. ... I used to go to the saloons with the baseball players, and while they would drink highballs and gin fizzes and beer, I would take lemonade.&quot; Following his conversion, Sunday denounced drinking, swearing, and gambling, and he changed his behavior, which was recognized by both teammates and fans. Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.

==Marriage==
In 1886, Sunday was introduced at Jefferson Park Presbyterian Church to Helen Amelia &quot;Nell&quot; Thompson, daughter of the owner of one of Chicago&#x27;s largest dairy products businesses. Although Sunday was immediately smitten with her, both had serious on-going relationships that bordered on engagements. Furthermore, Nell Thompson had grown to maturity in a much more privileged environment than had Sunday, and her father strongly discouraged the courtship, viewing all professional baseball players as &quot;transient ne&#x27;er-do-wells who were unstable and destined to be misfits once they were too old to play.&quot; Nevertheless, Sunday pursued and eventually married her. On several occasions, Sunday said, &quot;She was a Presbyterian, so I am a Presbyterian. Had she been a Catholic, I would have been a Catholicbecause I was hot on the trail of Nell.&quot; Her mother liked Sunday from the start and weighed in on his side, and her father finally relented. The couple was married on September 5, 1888.

==Apprenticeship for evangelism==
In the spring of 1891, Sunday turned down a baseball contract for $3,500 a year to accept a position with the Chicago YMCA at $83 per month. Sunday&#x27;s job title at the YMCA was Assistant Secretary, yet the position involved a great deal of ministerial work. It proved to be good preparation for his later evangelistic career. For three years Sunday visited the sick, prayed with the troubled, counseled the suicidal, and visited saloons to invite patrons to evangelistic meetings.

In 1893, Sunday became the full-time assistant to J. Wilbur Chapman, one of the best known evangelists in the United States at the time. Chapman was well educated and was a meticulous dresser, &quot;suave and urbane.&quot; Personally shy, like Sunday, Chapman commanded respect in the pulpit both because of his strong voice and his sophisticated demeanor. Sunday&#x27;s job as Chapman&#x27;s advance man was to precede the evangelist to cities in which he was scheduled to preach, organize prayer meetings and choirs, and in general take care of necessary details. When tents were used, Sunday would often help erect them.

By listening to Chapman preach night after night, Sunday received a valuable course in homiletics. Chapman also critiqued Sunday&#x27;s own attempts at evangelistic preaching and showed him how to put a good sermon together. Further, Chapman encouraged Sunday&#x27;s theological development, especially by emphasizing the importance of prayer and by helping to &quot;reinforce Billy&#x27;s commitment to conservative biblical Christianity.&quot;

==Popular evangelist==
===Kerosene circuit===
When Chapman unexpectedly returned to the pastorate in 1896, Sunday struck out on his own, beginning with meetings in tiny Garner, Iowa. For the next twelve years Sunday preached in approximately seventy communities, most of them in Iowa and Illinois. Sunday referred to these towns as the &quot;kerosene circuit&quot; because, unlike Chicago, most were not yet electrified. Towns often booked Sunday meetings informally, sometimes by sending a delegation to hear him preach and then telegraphing him while he was holding services somewhere else.

Sunday also took advantage of his reputation as a baseball player to generate advertising for his meetings. In 1907 in Fairfield, Iowa, Sunday organized local businesses into two baseball teams and scheduled a game between them. Sunday came dressed in his professional uniform and played on both sides. Although baseball was his primary means of publicity, Sunday also once hired a circus giant to serve as an usher.

When Sunday began to attract crowds larger than could be accommodated in rural churches or town halls, he pitched rented canvas tents. Again, Sunday did much of the physical work of putting them up, manipulating ropes during storms, and seeing to their security by sleeping in them at night. Not until 1905 was he well-off enough to hire his own advance man.

In 1906, an October snowstorm in Salida, Colorado, destroyed Sunday&#x27;s tenta special disaster because revivalists were typically paid with a freewill offering at the end of their meetings. Thereafter he insisted that towns build him temporary wooden tabernacles at their expense. The tabernacles were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold at the end of the meetings), and locals had to put up the money for them in advance. This change in Sunday&#x27;s operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore. At least at first, raising tabernacles provided good public relations for the coming meetings as townspeople joined in what was effectively a giant barnraising. Sunday built rapport by participating in the process, and the tabernacles were also a status symbol, because they had previously been built only for major evangelists such as Chapman.

===Under the administration of Nell===
Eleven years into Sunday&#x27;s evangelistic career, both he and his wife had been pushed to their emotional limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. Sunday depended on his wife&#x27;s love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.

Nell Sunday transformed her husband&#x27;s out-of-the-back-pocket organization into a &quot;nationally renowned phenomenon.&quot; New personnel were hired, and by the New York campaign of 1917, the Sundays had a paid staff of twenty-six. There were musicians, custodians, and advance men; but the Sundays also hired Bible teachers of both genders, who among other responsibilities, held daytime meetings at schools and shops and encouraged their audiences to attend the main tabernacle services in the evenings. The most significant of these new staff members were Homer Rodeheaver, an exceptional song leader and music director who worked with the Sundays for almost twenty years beginning in 1910, and Virginia Healey Asher, who (besides regularly singing duets with Rodeheaver) directed the women&#x27;s ministries, especially the evangelization of young working women.

===Campaign platform===

With his wife administering the campaign organization, Sunday was free to compose and deliver colloquial sermons. Typically, Homer Rodeheaver would first warm up the crowd with congregational singing that alternated with numbers from gigantic choirs and music performed by the staff. When Sunday felt the moment right, he would launch into his message. Sunday gyrated, stood on the pulpit, ran from one end of the platform to the other, and dove across the stage, pretending to slide into home plate. Sometimes he even smashed chairs to emphasize his points. His sermon notes had to be printed in large letters so that he could catch a glimpse of them as he raced by the pulpit. In messages attacking sexual sin to groups of men only, Sunday could be graphic for the era.

A theological opponent, Universalist minister Frederick William Betts, wrote: 
Homer Rodeheaver said that &quot;One of these sermons, until he tempered it down a little, had one ten-minute period in it where from two to twelve men fainted and had to be carried out every time I heard him preach it.&quot; Some religious and social leaders criticized Sunday&#x27;s exaggerated gestures as well as the slang and colloquialisms that filled his sermons, but audiences clearly enjoyed them.

In 1907, journalist Lindsay Denison complained that Sunday preached &quot;the old, old doctrine of damnation&quot;. Denison wrote, &quot;In spite of his conviction that the truly religious man should take his religion joyfully, he gets his results by inspiring fear and gloom in the hearts of sinners. The fear of death, with torment beyond it—intensified by examples of the frightful deathbeds of those who have carelessly or obdurately put off salvation until it is too late—it is with this mighty menace that he drives sinners into the fold.&quot; But Sunday himself told reporters &quot;with ill-concealed annoyance&quot; that his revivals had &quot;no emotionalism.&quot; Caricatures compared him to the extravagances of mid-nineteenth-century camp meetings, as in the famous drawing &quot;Billy Sunday&quot; by George Bellows. Sunday told one reporter that he believed that people could &quot;be converted without any fuss,&quot; and, at Sunday&#x27;s meetings, &quot;instances of spasm, shakes, or fainting fits caused by hysteria were few and far between.&quot;

Crowd noise, especially coughing and crying babies, was a significant impediment to Sunday&#x27;s preaching because the wooden tabernacles were so acoustically live. During his preliminaries, Rodeheaver often instructed audiences about how to muffle their coughs. Nurseries were always provided, infants forbidden, and Sunday sometimes appeared rude in his haste to rid the hall of noisy children who had slipped through the ushers.

Tabernacle floors were covered with sawdust to dampen the noise of shuffling feet (as well as for its pleasant smell and its ability to hold down the dust of dirt floors), and walking to the front at the preacher&#x27;s invitation became known as &quot;hitting the sawdust trail.&quot; The term was first used in a Sunday campaign in Bellingham, Washington, in 1910. Apparently, &quot;hitting the sawdust trail&quot; had first been used by loggers in the Pacific Northwest to describe following home a trail of previously dropped sawdust through an uncut forest — described by Nell Sunday as a metaphor for coming from &quot;a lost condition to a saved condition.&quot;

By 1910, Sunday began to conduct meetings (usually longer than a month) in small cities like Youngstown, Wilkes-Barre, South Bend, and Denver, and then finally, between 1915 and 1917, the major cities of Philadelphia, Syracuse, Kansas City, Detroit, Boston, Buffalo, and New York City. During the 1910s, Sunday was front-page news in the cities where he held campaigns. Newspapers often printed his sermons in full, and during World War I, local coverage of his campaigns often surpassed that of the war. Sunday was the subject of over sixty articles in major periodicals, and he was a staple of the religious press regardless of denomination.

Over the course of his career, Sunday probably preached to more than one hundred million people face-to-face—and, to the great majority, without electronic amplification. Vast numbers &quot;hit the sawdust trail.&quot; Although the usual total given for those who came forward at invitations is an even million, one modern historian estimates the true figure to be closer to 1,250,000. Sunday did not preach to a hundred million different individuals but to many of the same people repeatedly over the course of a campaign. Before his death, Sunday estimated that he had preached nearly 20,000 sermons, an average of 42 per month from 1896 to 1935. During his heyday, when he was preaching more than twenty times each week, his crowds were often huge. Even in 1923, well into the period of his decline, 479,300 people attended the 79 meetings of the six-week 1923 Columbia, South Carolina, campaign – 23 times the white population of Columbia. Nevertheless,&quot;trail hitters&quot; were not necessarily conversions (or even &quot;reconsecrations&quot;) to Christianity. Sometimes whole groups of club members came forward en masse at Sunday&#x27;s prodding. By 1927, Rodeheaver was complaining that Sunday&#x27;s invitations had become so general that they were meaningless.

===Wages of success===

Large crowds and an efficient organization meant that Sunday was soon netting hefty offerings. The first questions about Sunday&#x27;s income were apparently raised during the Columbus, Ohio, campaign at the turn of 1912–13. During the Pittsburgh campaign a year later, Sunday spoke four times per day and effectively made $217 per sermon or $870 a day at a time when the average gainfully employed worker made $836 per year. The major cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and New York City gave Sunday even larger offerings. Sunday donated Chicago&#x27;s offering of $58,000 to Pacific Garden Mission and the $120,500 New York offering to war charities. Nevertheless, between 1908 and 1920, the Sundays earned over a million dollars; an average worker during the same period earned less than $14,000.
Sunday was welcomed into the circle of the social, economic, and political elite. He counted among his neighbors and acquaintances several prominent businessmen. Sunday dined with numerous politicians, including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and counted both Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller Jr. as friends. During and after the 1917 Los Angeles campaign, the Sundays visited with Hollywood stars, and members of Sunday&#x27;s organization played a charity baseball game against a team of show business personalities that included Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.

The Sundays enjoyed dressing well and dressing their children well; the family sported expensive but tasteful coats, boots, and jewelry. Nell Sunday also bought land as an investment. In 1909, the Sundays bought an apple orchard in Hood River, Oregon, where they vacationed for several years. Although the property sported only a rustic cabin, reporters called it a &quot;ranch.&quot; Sunday was a soft touch with money and gave away much of his earnings. Neither of the Sundays were extravagant spenders. Although Sunday enjoyed driving, the couple never owned a car. In 1911, the Sundays moved to Winona Lake, Indiana, and built an American Craftsman-style bungalow, which they called &quot;Mount Hood&quot;, probably as a reminder of their Oregon vacation cabin. The bungalow, furnished in the popular Arts and Crafts style, had two porches and a terraced garden but only nine rooms, of living space, and no garage.

==Religious views==
Sunday was a conservative evangelical who accepted fundamentalist doctrines. He affirmed and preached the biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth of Jesus, the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Jesus, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At the turn of the 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in cities where he was not welcomed by the vast majority of the Protestant churches and their clergy.

Sunday was not a separationist as were many Protestants of his era. He went out of his way to avoid criticizing the Roman Catholic Church and even met with Cardinal Gibbons during his 1916 Baltimore campaign. Also, cards filled out by &quot;trail hitters&quot; were faithfully returned to the church or denomination that the writers had indicated as their choice, including Catholic and Unitarian.

Although Sunday was ordained by the Presbyterian Church in 1903, his ministry was nondenominational and he was not a strict Calvinist. He preached that individuals were, at least in part, responsible for their own salvation. &quot;Trail hitters&quot; were given a four-page tract that stated, &quot;if you have done &quot;your&quot; part (i.e. believe that Christ died in your place, and receive Him as your Saviour and Master) God has done HIS part and imparted to you His own nature.&quot;

Sunday never attended seminary and made no pretense of being a theologian or an intellectual, but he had a thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read on religious and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader&#x27;s notes in his characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday&#x27;s books were even those of religious opponents. He was once charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by the noted agnostic Robert Ingersoll.

Sunday&#x27;s homespun preaching had a wide appeal to his audiences, who were &quot;entertained, reproached, exhorted, and astonished.&quot; Sunday claimed to be &quot;an old-fashioned preacher of the old-time religion&quot; and his uncomplicated sermons spoke of a personal God, salvation through Jesus Christ, and following the moral lessons of the Bible. Sunday&#x27;s theology, although sometimes denigrated as simplistic, was situated within the mainstream Protestantism of his time.

==Social and political views==
Sunday was a lifelong Republican, and he espoused the mainstream political and social views of his native Midwest: individualism, competitiveness, personal discipline, and opposition to government regulation. Writers such as Sinclair Lewis, Henry M. Tichenor, and John Reed attacked Sunday as a tool of big business, and poet Carl Sandburg called him a &quot;four-flusher&quot; and a &quot;bunkshooter.&quot; Nevertheless, Sunday sided with Progressives on some issues. For example, he denounced child labor and supported urban reform and women&#x27;s suffrage. Sunday condemned capitalists &quot;whose private lives are good, but whose public lives are very bad&quot;, as well as those &quot;who would not pick the pockets of one man with the fingers of their hand&quot; but who would &quot;without hesitation pick the pockets of eighty million people with fingers of their monopoly or commercial advantage.&quot; Sunday expressed sympathy for the poor and tried to bridge the gulf between the races during the zenith of the Jim Crow era. However, Sunday regularly received contributions from members of the Second Ku Klux Klan during the 1920s. In another instance, in 1927, in Bangor, Maine, Sunday&#x27;s partner and music director, Homer Rodeheaver, told Klansmen who briefly interrupted the service that &quot;he did not believe that any organization that marched behind the Cross of Christ and the American Flag could be anything but a power for good.&quot; Sunday himself praised Klansmen who assisted the police in vice raids.

Sunday was a passionate supporter of America entering World War I. In 1918 he said, &quot;I tell you it is [Kaiser] Bill against Woodrow, Germany against America, Hell against Heaven.&quot; Sunday raised large amounts of money for the troops, sold war bonds, and stumped for recruitment.

Sunday had been an ardent champion of temperance from his earliest days as an evangelist, and his ministry at the Chicago YMCA had given him first-hand experience with the destructive potential of alcohol. Sunday&#x27;s most famous sermon was &quot;Get on the Water Wagon&quot;, which he preached on countless occasions with both histrionic emotion and a &quot;mountain of economic and moral evidence.&quot; Sunday said, &quot;I am the sworn, eternal and uncompromising enemy of the Liquor Traffic. I have been, and will go on, fighting that damnable, dirty, rotten business with all the power at my command.&quot; Sunday played a significant role in arousing public interest in Prohibition and in the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919. When the tide of public opinion turned against Prohibition, he continued to support it. After its repeal in 1933, Sunday called for its reintroduction.

Sunday also opposed eugenics, recent immigration from southern and eastern Europe, and the teaching of evolution. Further, he criticized such popular middle-class amusements as dancing, playing cards, attending the theater, and reading novels. However, he believed baseball was a healthy and even patriotic form of recreation, so long as it was not played on Sundays.

==Decline and death==
Sunday&#x27;s popularity waned after World War I, when many people in his revival audiences were attracted to radio broadcasts and moving pictures instead. The Sundays&#x27; health also declined even as they continued to drive themselves through rounds of revivals—smaller but also with fewer staff members to assist them.

Tragedy marred Sunday&#x27;s final years. His three sons engaged in many of the activities he preached against, and the Sundays paid blackmail to several women to keep the scandals relatively quiet. In 1930, Nora Lynn, their housekeeper and nanny, who had become a virtual member of the family, died. Then the Sundays&#x27; daughter, the only child actually raised by Nell, died in 1932 of what seems to have been multiple sclerosis. Their oldest son George, rescued from financial ruin by his parents, committed suicide in 1933.

Nevertheless, even as the crowds declined during the last 15 years of his life, Sunday continued accepting preaching invitations and speaking with effect. In early 1935, he had a mild heart attack, and his doctor advised him to stay out of the pulpit. Sunday ignored the advice. He died on November 6, a week after preaching his last sermon on the text &quot;What must I do to be saved?&quot;

<text>Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Rodney Park, (15 June 1892 – 6 February 1975) was a New Zealand-born officer of the Royal Air Force (RAF). During the Second World War, his leadership of the RAF&#x27;s No. 11 Group was pivotal to the defeat of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in the Battle of Britain.

Born in Thames, Park was a mariner when he enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force for service in the First World War. Posted to the artillery, he fought in the Gallipoli campaign, during which he transferred to the British Army. On the Western Front, he was present for the Battle of the Somme and was wounded. He obtained another transfer, this time to the Royal Flying Corps. Once his flight training was completed, he served as an instructor before being posted to No. 48 Squadron on the Western Front. He became a flying ace, achieving several aerial victories and eventually commanding the squadron.

In the interwar period, Park served with the RAF in a series of command and staff postings, including a period as air attaché in South America. By the late 1930s, he was serving in Fighter Command, as Air Marshal Hugh Dowding&#x27;s senior air staff officer. The two worked to devise tactics and management strategies for the air defence of the United Kingdom. Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War, Park was given command of No. 11 Group, responsible for the defence of South East England and London. Owing to its strategic significance and geographic location in relation to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, No. 11 Group bore the brunt of the German aerial assault during the Battle of Britain. Park&#x27;s management of his fighter aircraft and pilots helped ensure that Britain retained air superiority along the English Channel.

Relieved of command after the Battle of Britain, Park served in a training role before being posted to the Middle East as Air Officer Commanding, Egypt, in late 1941. Midway through the following year, he took charge of the aerial defences of Malta, then under heavy attack from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Italian Air Force). When the siege was lifted Park transitioned Malta&#x27;s RAF forces from a defensive role into an offensive footing in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily. From 1944, he held senior roles in the Middle East and in British India. He retired from the RAF in 1946 as an air chief marshal. Returning to New Zealand, he worked in the aviation industry for a British aircraft manufacturer and then became involved in local body politics in Auckland. He died from heart problems in February 1975.

==Early life==
Born in Thames, New Zealand, on 15 June 1892, Keith Rodney Park was the third son and ninth child of Professor James Livingstone Park from Scotland, a geologist and director of the Thames School of Mines, and his wife, New Zealand native Frances Rogers. Park was schooled at King&#x27;s College in Auckland until 1905. The following year he attended Otago Boys&#x27; High School in Dunedin, where his father had moved the family following his appointment as a lecturer in mining at the University of Otago. By this time Park&#x27;s parents had separated, his mother moving to Australia and leaving the children in the care of their father.

At Otago Boys&#x27; High, Park joined the school&#x27;s Cadet Corps. Completing his education, he found employment at the Union Steam Ship Company. He had always enjoyed boats and within the Park family was known as &quot;Skipper&quot;. He went to sea as a purser aboard collier and passenger steamships, initially on vessels sailing along the coast but later on ships travelling to Australia and islands in the Pacific. He also served as a Territorial soldier in the New Zealand Field Artillery from March 1911 to November 1913.

==First World War==
Soon after outbreak of the First World War, Park&#x27;s employers gave him permission to leave the company and join the war effort. He enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) on 14 December 1914, and was posted to the Field Artillery. He was promoted to corporal in early February 1915. Park departed New Zealand the same month as part of the third draft of reinforcements for the NZEF, destined for the Middle East. On arrival, he was posted to the 4th Howitzer Battery, under the command of Major Norrie Falla.

In early April 1915, military planners in London decided that the NZEF should be part of the Allied forces that would open up a new front in the Middle East by landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula. Park participated in the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April, going ashore that evening or early the following morning with his battery. The 4th Howitzer Battery was the only such unit at Anzac Cove but had limited ammunition and initially was unable to expend more than a few rounds a day. When not engaged in artillery fire, Park acted as a messenger. In the trench warfare that followed, Park&#x27;s achievements were recognised and in July he was commissioned a second lieutenant. He commanded an artillery battery during the August offensive. Afterwards Park took the unusual decision to transfer from the NZEF to the British Army, relinquishing his commission and joining the Royal Horse and Field Artillery. He never explained his motivations for doing so.

Attached to the 29th Division as a temporary second lieutenant, Park was posted to No. 10 Battery, of the 147th Brigade, at Helles. He was commander of a 12-pounder naval gun, which was often subject to Turkish counter-fire. He and the rest of his battery was evacuated from Gallipoli to Egypt in January 1916, after the decision was made to abandon the Allied positions there. The battle had left its mark on him both physically and mentally, though later on in life he would remember it with nostalgia. He particularly admired the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps commander, Sir William Birdwood, whose leadership style and attention to detail was a model for Park in his later career.

In March, Park&#x27;s battery, along with the rest of the 29th Division, was shipped to the Western Front and assigned to a sector along the Somme. Two months later, Park&#x27;s rank was made substantive. By this time he had an interest in aviation; while in Egypt preparing for the move to France, he had requested a flight so that he could assess its suitability to help in observations but was told that aerial reconnaissance was a waste of time. Now, prior to the Battle of the Somme, he learned how useful aircraft could be in a military role, getting a taste of flight by being taken aloft to check his battery&#x27;s camouflage. He reported back on the ready manner in which the British guns could be detected. During the battle itself, which commenced on 1 July, the artillery was heavily engaged. On 21 October, while trying to withdraw an unserviceable gun for repair, Park was blown off his horse by a German shell. Wounded, he was evacuated to England and medically certified &quot;unfit for active service&quot;, which technically meant he was unfit to ride a horse. After a brief remission recovering from his wounds, recuperating and doing training duties at Woolwich Depot, he joined the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in December. He had been trying for some time to obtain a transfer but the senior officers in the 29th Division would not allow this for its personnel serving in France; in later years Park saw his wounding as being particularly fortuitous for his future military career.

==Royal Flying Corps==
Park&#x27;s RFC training commenced at Reading with a course at the School of Military Aeronautics. Much of this initial training involved military basics, such as drill, and theoretical matters, like Morse code. His flight instruction did not commence until he went to Netheravon where, after flying an Avro 504K with an instructor, he soloed in a Maurice Farman MF11 Shorthorn. The RFC still lacked sophistication in its flight training, and many pilots were sent to France with little more than basic flying skills. Park, having accumulated over 20 hours solo and 30 hours flying, had qualified for his wings and was posted to Rendcomb for instructing duties in March 1917.

At Rendcomb, Park accumulated over 100 hours flying time before, in June, he was posted to France. The time he had spent in the air at this stage enhanced his survival prospects in aerial combat. On reporting to RFC headquarters in Boulogne, he was advised that he was to be a bomber pilot and sent to a depot pool of pilots at Saint-Omer. This was despite his specialisation in fighter aircraft. After some days without an assignment, he contacted No. 48 Squadron, a fighter unit at La Bellevue; this resulted in Park&#x27;s posting to that squadron on 7 July.

===Service with No. 48 Squadron===
Shortly after Park&#x27;s arrival at No. 48 Squadron, the unit moved to Frontier Aerodrome just east of Dunkirk. The squadron was equipped with the new Bristol Fighter, a two-seat biplane fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and carried out patrols and reconnaissance flights. It also escorted bombers attacking German airfields in Belgium. Park had his first encounter with fighters of the Imperial German Air Service on 24 July 1917, when he was engaged by three Albatros D.III scout aircraft near Middelkerke. He and his observer, Second Lieutenant A. Merchant, operating a Lewis gun, drove off the attackers, sending one out of control. When the Germans started using their heavy bombers to attack London and other targets in England during the summer, No. 48 Squadron was tasked with interception duties. Park never saw any bombers on these flights.

Park achieved his second aerial victory on 12 August when, flying with Second Lieutenant Arthur Noss as his observer, he was attacked by a pair of Albatrosses while returning to base after a patrol. Sustained gun fire from Noss drove an Albatros out of control. On 16 August, again paired with Noss, the duo combined to send a DFW C.V reconnaissance aircraft out of control. The following day Park and Noss engaged in a prolonged dogfight that began at over Slijpe and ended near Ghistelles at a height of . The pair destroyed one Albatros, seeing it crash into the sea, and sent three others out of control. In recognition of their successes, the commander of 4th Brigade, Brigadier-General John Becke, recommended Park and Noss for the Military Cross (MC). This was duly awarded, the published citation for Park&#x27;s MC reading:
On 21 August Park, flying with Second Lieutenant W. O&#x27;Toole while Noss was rested, drove two Albatros scouts out of control. Back with Noss on 25 August, the pair destroyed an Albatros south of Slijpe. On 2 September, with Alan Light, Park had two separate engagements with Albatrosses near Diksmuide; both aircraft that he and Light fired at were seen to be going down in an uncontrolled manner. On 5 September Park, flying with Air Mechanic H. Lindfield, killed a pilot of &quot;Jasta Boelcke&quot;, Franz Pernet, the stepson of General Erich Ludendorff, off Ostend. Flying near Slijpe on 9 September, he and Lindfield drove an Albatros out of control, and two days later Park was promoted to temporary captain. He destroyed an Albatros on 14 September, with Second Lieutenant H. Owen as his observer, and sent another Albatros out of control. Park was the squadron&#x27;s most successful pilot over the August–September period and Becke recommended him for the Distinguished Service Order. The senior officer of the RFC in France, Major-General Hugh Trenchard, downgraded this to a Bar to his MC on the basis that this was sufficient reward. The published citation read:
Towards the end of September, No. 48 Squadron moved to the Arras sector, having incurred several casualties in the previous weeks. There, Park, now a flight leader, concentrated on preparing his command, which contained many inexperienced replacement pilots, for aerial combat. It was now involved in less dangerous work, mostly reconnaissance patrols, and casualties were light. In November, he was awarded a French honour, the &quot;Croix de guerre&quot;, for services in support of the 1st French Army&#x27;s operations during its time in the Flanders sector of Belgium. On 3 January 1918, Park and his observer, Lieutenant J. Robertson, were flying near Ramicourt on a photo reconnaissance when they were engaged by several German Albatros fighters. Park was able to send one Albatros out of control although his observer&#x27;s gun jammed. Park eventually evaded the pursuing fighters, although his engine was damaged by machine-gun fire and he force landed behind British lines. He was then sent to England for a rest; this proved to be brief for later in January he was posted to Hooton Park to instruct Canadian trainee pilots.

===Squadron command===

Following the commencement of the German spring offensive in late March 1918, Park returned to France as a major to take command of No. 48 Squadron. By this time he was the only surviving pilot from its 1917 ranks. The first few days of his tenure were marked by relocations, as the squadron repeatedly retreated to new sites to stay ahead of the advancing Germans. It eventually settled in at Bertangles, where it remained for some time. Park was well respected by his men, though he tended to avoid close relationships with those under his command.

The squadron carried out low-level attacks on German troops and positions, as well as its regular reconnaissance work. The Bristol Fighter was unsuited to the former role, having limited maneuverability at low altitude. At one point in the later stages of the German advance, the squadron was reduced to three operational aircraft, the rest having been damaged or destroyed by ground fire. On 18 May, he and his observer engaged a Pfalz D.III, driving it out of control near Bray. The following month, on 25 June, flying with Second Lieutenant H. Knowles, he destroyed a Rumpler reconnaissance aircraft, and sent a DFW C.V out of control.

In August Park was wounded during a bombing raid on his squadron&#x27;s airfield at Bertangles, but managed to help other injured men escape from burning hangars. By November, the strain of command had all but exhausted Park. On 9 November, in a fatigued state, he crashed a Bristol during a test flight. Two days later, the war ended. There is some confusion regarding the number of aerial victories Park achieved during the course of the war; official documentation of No. 48 Squadron states that he and his observers were credited with destroying 9 and sending 11 out of control, a total of 20 German aircraft. Records in the Air Ministry credit him with 14 aerial victories. Park&#x27;s biographer Vincent Orange considered that Park definitely destroyed 11 aircraft and damaged, if not destroyed, 13 others.

==Interwar period==
Just after the war, on 25 November 1918, Park married Dorothy &quot;Dol&quot; Parish at Christ Church in Lancaster Gate. The two had met in October 1917 when Park stayed at the home of a fellow pilot while on leave in London. Parish, born in London, was a nurse during the war. Park had applied for a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) earlier in the year, but heard nothing despite his application having the support of his wing commander. For the time being, he was posted to command of No. 54 Training Depot at Fairlop, but was deemed fit only for light flying and ground duties. In February 1919 he applied again for a permanent commission in the RAF. The same month his father made an application on Park&#x27;s behalf to the Minister of Defence in New Zealand for a possible role in the military aviation service that had been proposed for the country&#x27;s defence. This proved to be fruitless as a firm decision regarding the service was not made. In the meantime Park also sought employment with a New Zealand firm, the Canterbury Aviation Company formed by Henry Wigram, a pioneer of commercial aviation in the country. Park was overlooked for the role.

Park went to London Colney to command the training depot there and also went on a course at the No. 2 School of Navigation and Bomb Dropping. In late April, together with a Captain Stewart, he flew a Handley Page 0/400 twin-engined bomber on a circuit of the British Isles, completing the flight in 28 hours, 30 minutes. It was the second such flight of its type, designed to foster public awareness of the RAF. The following month, Park had a medical examination which raised concerns about his health owing to his war wounds, as well as nervous and cardiovascular issues. He was deemed to be unfit for further service, notwithstanding the record flight he had just made. Park took leave for rest and two months later sought a re-examination. This graded him fit for ground duties although he was still not able to fly. In the meantime, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross &quot;in recognition of distinguished services rendered during the war&quot;. 

Park was granted his permanent commission in September, with effect from 1 August 1919, with the rank of flight lieutenant. He was appointed commander of a store of Handley Page aircraft at Hawkinge. The role did not satisfy him and he was pleased when, in early 1920, he was posted to the newly reformed No. 25 Squadron as a flight commander. At the time, it was the only fighter squadron based in the United Kingdom. Later that year he took command of the School of Technical Training, based at Manston, and was subsequently promoted to squadron leader. His health also improved. In April 1922 he was one of twenty officers selected to attend the newly formed RAF Staff College at Andover. Fellow students on the 12-month course included Sholto Douglas, with whom he had clashed the previous year over arrangements for flight demonstrations at an air show, and Charles Portal, both of whom would go on to serve as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).

===Staff officer===
In March 1923, Park&#x27;s health was sufficiently restored that he was returned to flight status and two months later he was posted to Egypt on technical duties. Based at Aboukir, he was accompanied by his wife and the couple&#x27;s young son. Later in the year, he transferred to Cairo as a technical staff officer at the headquarters of RAF Middle East Command. In October 1924 he was switched to air staff duties. He became well respected by his commander, Oliver Swann, who advocated for him in 1925 when concerns were raised regarding Park&#x27;s health. In June 1926, Park and his family, which now included a second son, returned to England. A medical examination at this time graded him fit for duty.

At the behest of an acquaintance, Air Commodore Felton Holt, Park was posted to the Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) in August. He was to serve on the staff of the commander of the ADGB, Air Marshal Sir John Salmond, with responsibility for &quot;Operations, Intelligence Mobilization and Combined Training&quot;. The ADGB, based at Uxbridge, was a RAF command tasked with the air defence of the United Kingdom, and Park was given considerable latitude in developing his role. After 15 months with the ADGB, Park was given a squadron command; he proceeded to Duxford to lead No. 111 Squadron, a fighter unit. It operated the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin and Park ensured that the squadron worked extensively, routinely recording high flying hours during his tenure in command. He was involved in an incident on 7 February 1928, when he crashed a Siskin while landing at night. In the ensuing investigation, he conceded his night vision was flawed and thereafter did not fly at night.

Park was promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1929 and posted back to Uxbridge on staff duties two months later. For two years running he helped in the organisation of the air pageants at Hendon, which drew over 100,000 spectators, and he was also involved in the development of systems for controlling the operations of fighter aircraft defending the United Kingdom from aerial attacks. His senior officer at this time was Air Vice Marshal Hugh Dowding. In January 1931, Park was given command of the RAF station at Northolt, his tenure lasting 18 months. He then became chief instructor at the Oxford University Air Squadron (OUAS). Park was responsible for 75 students, among them Archibald Hope, who later commanded No. 601 Squadron. Hope regarded Park as a good commander of the OUAS, as did a junior instructor, the future flying ace Tom Gleave. Many of the students at OUAS, encouraged by Park, would go on to join the RAF. He was subsequently awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree by Oxford University in recognition of his services.

===South America===
In November 1934, Park was dispatched to Buenos Aires to serve as the Air Attaché for South America. A key part of his role was to facilitate local interest in British aircraft. He had been given notice of his appointment some months before, affording him time to learn Spanish. He was accompanied by his wife but their two children remained in England, attending boarding schools. Park&#x27;s wife Dol had longstanding connections to Argentina, as members of her family had held diplomatic postings in the country. Soon after his arrival he was promoted to group captain. He travelled throughout the continent, visiting aircraft factories and air bases, and promoting British aircraft, military and civilian. The work was challenging as American aircraft manufacturers dominated the scene and he was not helped by the Air Ministry&#x27;s commitment to expanding the RAF in preference to making aircraft sales to other countries. The skills he learnt in the role, ranging from mixing with military personnel of all ranks to rapid inspections of air bases, proved beneficial in the future.

===Fighter Command===
Park was appointed Air Aide-de-Camp to King George VI in early 1937. By this time, he had returned to the United Kingdom and was attending the Imperial Defence College, which was close to Buckingham Palace. The course at the Imperial Defence College was designed to enhance the knowledge of its students, mostly senior officers from the British armed forces, in staff, diplomacy and political matters. Park became known for being a questioning student, and demanding of guest lecturers. At the end of the year, he took command of the RAF station at Tangmere, which was home to two fighter squadrons and a bomber unit. In April 1938, he took ill with streptococcal pharyngitis; this prevented him from taking up his next posting in Palestine, which instead went to Arthur Harris, future leader of Bomber Command. Park, after a period of rest, took the position that had been intended for Harris: Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) to Hugh Dowding, the commander of Fighter Command, which had been formed in July 1936, after the ADGB was split up.

Park took up his new appointment in May, and this coincided with a promotion to air commodore. He was now based at Bentley Priory, second-in-command to Dowding. The pair worked towards the development of an operational defence system for the United Kingdom, the first of its type in the world. This involved improving the operational efficiency of Fighter Command and the integration of radio direction finding (RDF) techniques into the tactical handling of fighters to counter incoming bombers. A key improvement made by Park in the control of RAF fighters over the southeast of England was better vetting of data that made it to the plotting tables on which movement of both friendly and enemy aircraft were shown. Dowding had been resistant to Park&#x27;s suggestion to filter out some data but became convinced of its merits when Park conducted unauthorised trials and showed the results to Dowding. The plotting tables, now less cluttered, made for more effective decision making.

With Dowding&#x27;s blessing, Park also worked on an air tactics manual for Fighter Command. As part of this he recommended replacing the rifle-calibre machine guns on the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters with heavy machine guns, but was overruled. He was also against the use of the conventional &quot;Vic&quot; formation used by the RAF, in which three fighter aircraft flew in a V-formation, on the basis that these were not suited for monoplanes and wanted to explore alternatives. Despite his efforts the Air Ministry maintained its existing approach to fighter tactics.

==Second World War==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Park supported Dowding in his efforts to retain as many fighter aircraft as possible for the air defence of the United Kingdom. This was despite the requests for fighter squadrons to support the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) dispatched to France shortly after the commencement of hostilities. During the Phoney War, there was great urgency in developing and implementing tactics for the defence of British airspace, through coordination of data collected from RDF stations, the Observer Corps, and the fighters themselves.

On 20 April 1940 Park took over from Air Vice Marshal William Welsh as commander of No. 11 Group, responsible for the fighter defence of London and southeast England. Promoted to acting air vice marshal the previous month, he had only just recovered from an emergency appendectomy. Park&#x27;s appointment affronted Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, the commander of neighbouring No. 12 Group, which covered the Midlands. Park had greater experience with fighters, and most of Leigh-Mallory&#x27;s career, aside from the three years that he had spent in charge of No. 12 Group, was in training roles. There were already tensions between Park and Leigh-Mallory; in exercises carried out in the summer of 1939, No. 12 Group had not performed as expected and Park, on behalf of Dowding, raised concerns in this respect.

===Dunkirk===
At the time Park took command of No. 11 Group, it was perceived that Leigh-Mallory&#x27;s No. 12 Group would bear the brunt of the German bombing campaign since this area of the British Isles was the closest to Germany. The subsequent invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May changed the threat level for the southeast of England. By 24 May the majority of the BEF, along with French and Belgian troops, had been pushed back and became encircled at Dunkirk. During the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, codenamed Operation Dynamo, No. 11 Group provided air cover under Park&#x27;s direction. The RAF fighters were disadvantaged, having to operate over from their bases in the southeast of England and without the benefit of radar coverage. At best, they had about 40 minutes flying time over Dunkirk.

Park operated patrol lines over Dunkirk on 27 May, the first day of the evacuation, but the RAF fighters were heavily outnumbered. They were unable to prevent the bombing of Dunkirk itself, but were able to provide some limited protection of the moles and ships. The following day, under orders from the CAS, Air Chief Marshal Cyril Newall, fighters attempted to provide continuous coverage throughout the day but were unable to do so due to their relatively limited numbers. Park advocated for the usage of at least two squadrons at a time in stronger patrols rather than the continuous coverage. This was based on his own observations from flying his personal Hurricane over Dunkirk. His approach was put into effect the next day, sometimes using as many as four squadrons, with greater intervals between patrols. Although there was some pressure from Newall and Churchill for a stronger RAF presence over the beachhead, Dowding sheltered Park from this influence and left him to his work. In the later stages of Operation Dynamo, which ended on 4 June, weather and the pressure from the advancing Germans forced the evacuation efforts to be concentrated on the times around dawn and dusk, and Park&#x27;s fighters were able to operate more effectively.

Throughout this period, Park not only flew his Hurricane to Dunkirk to see the situation for himself, but also visited RAF airfields and met personnel, both pilots and groundcrew. He was very recognisable, wearing white overalls when flying. This helped foster his reputation within No. 11 Group. He also maintained a desire to switch to the offensive; just two weeks after Dunkirk, he sought to have some Hurricane squadrons refitted as fighter-bombers and used, along with Bristol Blenheims, to make nighttime attack on the German airfields in France. Dowding did not approve.

===Battle of Britain===
At the commencement of the Battle of Britain, Fighter Command had 58 squadrons spread across four fighter groups. As well as Park&#x27;s No. 11 Group and Leigh-Mallory&#x27;s No. 12 Group, these included No. 10 Group, which covered the southwest of England, and No. 13 Group, covering the north of England and Scotland. Being responsible for the south-eastern England area, including London, No. 11 Group faced the bulk of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s air strength, at least 1,000 bombers and 400 fighters. To counter this, Park had at his disposal 350 fighters across 22 fighter squadrons and just over 550 pilots. He was also able to draw upon the neighbouring groups for reinforcements as required. Park directed that the fighter squadrons under his control be scrambled against incoming German bombers with the aim of attacking them before they reached their targets, and that engaging fighter escorts should be avoided.

Using the plotting tables at his headquarters at Uxbridge, Park had to assess which raids were a real threat and which were intended to draw away RAF fighters. Timing was important; incoming raids needed to be intercepted before reaching their targets. An understanding of what aircraft were available was also critical. He needed to ensure that there were as many as possible in the air to counter the German bombers and to avoid having too many on the ground being refuelled and rearmed. Even with the benefit of radar, Park was still disadvantaged. He usually had only around 20 minutes from when radar detected the buildup of the incoming bombers over the Pas de Calais or Cotentin regions to scramble his squadrons and have them at a suitable height for interception. To help remedy this disadvantage, he often directed his squadrons to take off in a direction away from the oncoming bombers so as to maximise the time they had to gain the necessary altitude to attack.

At the start of the Battle of Britain, generally deemed by British historians to be 10 July (German sources usually cite a date in August), the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s initial focus was to gain air superiority over the English Channel, before moving to strike targets inland of the coastline. Its targets were shipping convoys moving through the Channel as well as the ports in the south of England. It was not until 1 August, when Adolf Hitler ordered the invasion of Britain, that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; escalated its aerial operations, with a view to the invasion commencing in late September. At this time the coastal radar stations were targeted, as well as airfields and aircraft manufacturing facilities. This placed further pressure on Park and how he dispersed his fighter squadrons. An added issue was the drain on pilots through combat losses and their replacements being inadequately trained. This was somewhat compensated for by transferring flying personnel from squadrons in the other Fighter Command Groups and volunteers from the Fleet Air Arm. He kept in regular contact with his squadrons, often flying his Hurricane to the airfields and addressing those under his command. These visits were important for morale, particularly for those airfields that had been bombed by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. According to his flying logbook, he made at least one operational sortie, on 10 July, to see a shipping convoy during a visit to Lympne airfield.

On 16 August, following a visit to Park&#x27;s headquarters at Uxbridge, Winston Churchill made a speech in which he recited one of his most famous lines, referring to RAF fighter pilots: &quot;Never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few&quot;. Churchill, who thought well of Park, made another visit to Uxbridge the following month, on 15 September. His visit coincided with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s greatest daytime raid on England. Churchill noted the many incoming German aircraft but was reassured with Park&#x27;s calm reply that RAF forces would meet them. He put up all his aircraft, leaving no reserve, and they were joined by 60 fighters from No. 12 Group. It was the first time that the RAF and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; met in nearly equal numbers. The German attack was a significant failure and an even larger raid mounted later in the afternoon was also unsuccessful. The date of 15 September subsequently became known as Battle of Britain Day. On the grounds that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had not yet achieved dominance in the air, Hitler consequently postponed the scheduled invasion of England but this would not become clear to the British for several more weeks.

Earlier in September, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had switched from attacking the RAF airfields to London itself. The Germans believed that Fighter Command was largely exhausted but the change in tactics was welcomed as both Park and Dowding recognised that it would be a relief for their pilots. At one stage the previous month, pilots and fighters were being lost at a greater rate than they could be replaced and Park had to close Biggin Hill, which had been rendered nonoperational due to bomb damage. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s shift to targeting London gave Park valuable breathing space to rebuild his damaged airfields. He also changed his own tactics, using his squadrons to intercept the German bombers and fighters making their way back to France after bombing London. Park later remarked to Alan Mitchell, a New Zealand journalist: &quot;The Hun lost the Battle of Britain when he switched from bombing my fighter-stations to bombing London...&quot;. Despite the change in tactics, No. 11 Group was still under pressure. It operated standing patrols to be ready to intercept incoming raids, which were now coming in at higher altitudes. It was therefore more difficult to make out whether such raids were bombers or just a large fighter sweep; Park sought to avoid engagement with the latter. He endeavoured to keep his pilots fresh and rested, arranging for improved facilities and billets away from areas being bombed.

====Big Wings controversy====
As the Battle of Britain progressed, Park had increasing concerns about Leigh-Mallory&#x27;s handling of No. 12 Group. Often, Park&#x27;s airfields were left exposed to attack while his squadrons were in the air so he and his controllers made requests to No. 12 Group for cover. In No. 12 Group, Leigh-Mallory encouraged the use of &quot;Big Wings&quot;; this involved assembling three or more squadrons in a formation before they were directed towards approaching German bombers. This took time and often by the time the Big Wing was assembled, the bombers had already attacked their targets and were on their way back to their bases in France. Leigh-Mallory believed that this was justified as the assembled Big Wing would theoretically inflict significant losses on the departing bombers. 

On several occasions in August, protection was requested from No. 12 Group for Park&#x27;s airfields at North Weald, Manston and Hornchurch, but they were still bombed due to the time taken to assemble the Big Wing. This led Park to claim to his sector controllers that Leigh-Mallory was negligent in his responsibilities. Park eventually resorted to directing his requests for cover by No. 12 Group through Fighter Command Headquarters for greater responsiveness.

Park was not opposed to the use of squadrons &quot;en masse&quot; and had used comparable tactics while defending the evacuation of the beaches at Dunkirk a few months previously. He recognised that the short time between the detection of the approaching German bombers and them reaching their targets in southeast England meant that Big Wings were not practical. Park preferred greater control over individual squadrons. This allowed him to be more responsive to changes in tactics by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; which might, for example, send one group of bombers to a certain target as a diversion to draw in RAF fighters while another group of bombers attacked the actual target.

A report that Leigh-Mallory had sent to the Air Ministry, which inflated claims made by No. 12 Group when operating the Big Wing, had found a receptive audience at senior levels of the RAF. Park sent his own report on recent operations during the August–September period, which included critical comments on the Air Ministry&#x27;s efforts in repairing damaged airfields. These complaints were poorly received. Underlying this was increasing tensions between Dowding and the Air Ministry over Fighter Command&#x27;s ability to deal with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s night bombing campaign. Sholto Douglas, the deputy CAS, felt Dowding was not dealing adequately with the situation. 

On 17 October Dowding and Park attended a meeting, chaired by Douglas, to discuss fighter tactics at the Air Ministry in London. Senior RAF personnel were present, including Leigh-Mallory but so was the relatively junior officer, Squadron Leader Douglas Bader, a firm advocate for the Big Wing. Neither Park nor Dowding had expected this nor thought to invite an officer with a contrary frontline experience. Park, who to some attendees appeared fatigued, found himself having to justify his interception methods and explain why the Big Wing was not an appropriate tactic for his area of operations. Leigh-Mallory countered, stating his desire to help No. 11 Group and promising good response times for assembly of the Big Wing. In the absence of any protest from Dowding, Douglas approved the use of Big Wings over No. 11 Group&#x27;s area of operations. The tactic was used by No. 12 Group for the rest of October but remained relatively ineffective, being too slow to get to where they were needed. Park continued to raise complaints about the use of Big Wings but Douglas saw this as being a personal objection to No. 12 Group operating in his sector.

===Relief===
By late October, it was clear that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s operations were lacking the intensity of previous months and, by the end of the month, the Battle of Britain was deemed to be over. Park&#x27;s mind turned to the commencement of offensive operations and he made proposals to attack the German airfields in France, identifying that these were vulnerable to surprise attacks prior to sunset. Dowding overruled him, although Douglas was receptive to the proposal. On 7 December, Park was replaced as commander of No. 11 Group, his successor being Leigh-Mallory. The decision had been made late the previous month. Officially, this was because Park needed a rest from the stress of the past several months. Park believed his relief was due to the dispute with Leigh-Mallory. 

Historian John Ray, in his account of Dowding&#x27;s handling of the Battle of Britain, argues that Park was seen at the Air Ministry as being closely aligned with Dowding, implementing the latter&#x27;s defensive scheme. Dowding, already overdue for his retirement, had been released from his post on 17 November and, once he went, Park had to follow to enable a fresh start at Fighter Command. Douglas took over Fighter Command and Leigh-Mallory No. 11 Group. According to Park, on his final day at No. 11 Group, he had to formally brief Leigh-Mallory&#x27;s SASO, rather than Leigh-Mallory himself who, contrary to custom, was not present for the changeover in command.

On learning of Park&#x27;s impending departure, Air Vice Marshal Richard Saul, who led No. 13 Group, wrote to Park and noted &quot;the magnificent achievements of your group in the past six months; they have borne the brunt of the war, and undoubtedly saved England&quot;. Arthur Tedder, a future CAS, later said of Park&#x27;s command of No. 11 Group: &quot;If ever any one man won the Battle of Britain, he did. I don&#x27;t believe it is realised how much that one man, with his leadership, his calm judgement and his skill, did to save not only this country, but the world&quot;. Park himself felt that Saul should have taken over No. 11 Group instead of Leigh-Mallory, on the basis that the former was much more familiar with the RAF stations in the area. The news of Park&#x27;s dismissal was met with dismay among his command. Wing Commander Victor Beamish, in charge of North Weald station, wrote to Park, advising that the regret at his departure crossed all ranks. Group Captain Cecil Bouchier, another senior officer within No. 11 Group, considered Park&#x27;s leadership &quot;...by his own infinite efforts...would not only ensure ultimate victory but inspire it&quot;. Subsequent appraisals of Park by German military intelligence were that he was a &quot;man of action&quot;, and was known as the &quot;Defender of London&quot;.

Shortly after his relief, on 17 December, it was publicly announced that Park had been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. According to the citation in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, the honour was &quot;in recognition of distinguished services rendered in recent operations&quot;. Despite this, Park was angry at his treatment by the Air Ministry and his opinion as to the reason for his relief was reinforced by comments from colleagues that unofficial reports had been made about Park&#x27;s poor relationship with Leigh-Mallory. Late the following year he wrote to the new CAS, Air Chief Marshal Charles Portal, who had made the decision to replace Park with Leigh-Mallory, arguing his case. Portal promptly replied with assurances that his decision had nothing to do with Leigh-Mallory and was simply a matter of Park&#x27;s health. Churchill was angered at the treatment of Park, and Dowding, by the Air Ministry&#x27;s publication in March 1941 of a pamphlet on the Battle of Britain, in which neither officer was mentioned. A subsequent republication of the pamphlet, in an illustrated form, remedied this omission.

===Training Command===
Declining an assignment to the Air Ministry, Park was posted to Training Command, taking charge of No. 23 Group. His command, centered on RAF South Cerney, encompassed seven service flying training schools, the Central Flying School at Upavon, and the School of Air Navigation at St Athan. It was later expanded with the addition of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment and the Blind Approach Development Unit, both at RAF Boscombe Down. When he arrived at his command on 27 December, he immediately noted deficiencies in its procedures as it had not moved to a wartime footing. Some within No. 23 Group appeared unaware of the urgent need for trained pilots during the Battle of Britain.

Park moved immediately to remedy the situation. As he had at No. 11 Group, Park regularly flew himself to the stations under his command. Within a month of his arrival, he had visited each unit at least once, seeing for himself their state of readiness. He improved operational efficiencies, introduced new equipment, and modernised airfields. At times he found within Training Command a cultural resistance to change that he had to overcome.

By the end of 1941, overseas training establishments were coming on line and Park was looking to a potential return to frontline duties. In December, he was given a posting to Iraq as Air Officer Commanding (AOC). In a matter of days this changed, and he instead proceeded to Egypt to become AOC there. In his new role, he was responsible for the aerial defence of the Nile Delta region, duties that were similar to those he performed as commander of No. 11 Group, although he now had night fighters under his control. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, flying from bases in the Greek islands, became more aggressive in its operations against targets in Egypt, threatening the buildup of Allied forces in the region. Park was able to improve the efficiency and coordination of Egypt&#x27;s defences and deal better with incoming bombing raids.

===Malta===

On 8 July 1942, Park relinquished command in Egypt and six days later went to Malta to replace Hugh Lloyd, the RAF commander on the island, which was under siege by the Axis powers. It was felt that Park&#x27;s experience of fighter defence operations was needed. Arriving by flying boat, he landed in the middle of a raid, although Lloyd had specifically requested he circle the harbour until it had passed. Lloyd met Park and admonished him for taking unnecessary risks in landing.

Park abandoned the defensive approach taken by Lloyd, in which the island&#x27;s fighters took off, circled behind the approaching bombers of the Axis forces and engaged them over Malta. Park, having plenty of Spitfires on hand, sought to intercept and break up the German and Italian bomber formations before they reached Malta. One squadron would endeavour to engage the fighters providing high cover for the bombers, another would deal with the closer escorting fighters and the third would seek out the bombers directly. 

Using these tactics, similar what had been employed by his No. 11 Group during the Battle of Britain, Park believed that it would be more likely that the enemy would be shot down or abort their objectives. His forces began implementing what Park called his &quot;Forward Interception Plan&quot; on 25 July. It was immediately successful and, within a week, daylight raids had ceased. The Axis response was to send in fighter sweeps at even higher altitudes to gain the tactical advantage. Park retaliated by ordering his fighters to climb no higher than . This conceded a considerable height advantage to the opposing fighters, but forced them to engage the Spitfires at altitudes more suitable for the latter.

By September the Axis&#x27;s aerial operations against Malta were on the decline and the British regained air superiority over the island. RAF bomber and torpedo squadrons soon returned to Malta in anticipation of offensive operations against German forces in North Africa. Park dispatched Hurricane fighter bombers, fitted with extra fuel tanks, to attack Axis supply lines as far away as Egypt. Vickers Wellington medium bombers and Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers attacked ports, shipping and airfields, disrupting the Axis supply routes. In October, the Axis resumed its bomber offensive against the island; resistance was more effective using Park&#x27;s tactics although some bombers still managed to attack targets on Malta.

With supplies more regularly getting through to Malta, offensive operations in support of the Allied campaign in North Africa increased under Park&#x27;s direction. More bombers arrived and these attacked targets in Algeria ahead of Operation Torch and, later, in Tunisia. There were also sorties against targets in Sicily and Sardinia. On 27 November, Park&#x27;s appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire was announced. This was &quot;in recognition of distinguished services in the campaign in the Middle East&quot;. At times his relations with senior officials on Malta were testy; Vice Admiral Power described Park as &quot;unsatisfactory to deal with&quot;. Park&#x27;s work was praised by the American Lieutenant General Dwight Eisenhower and British Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, appreciative of the RAF&#x27;s operations from Malta in support of their ground forces in North Africa.

Operations of RAF forces in Malta against Sicily became increasingly important into 1943; the Italian island was a major departure point for shipping taking supplies to the Axis forces in Tunisia. By the end of May, Park had 600 modern aircraft under his control, three times what he had at the start of the year. RAF facilities on Malta had also undergone significant expansion in anticipation of the island serving as a major airbase in support of an Allied offensive against Italy. This began with the invasion of Sicily on 10 July, a campaign lasting less than six weeks. Before its commencement, Park arranged the construction of a control room at Malta. From here, he directed operations of the aircraft under his command, which amounted to 40 squadrons based at Malta, Gozo and Pantelleria. 

In September, Park went to London on leave and, while there, agitated for a new posting. Portal, still the CAS, thought that Park could become head of the Northwest African Tactical Air Force, replacing another New Zealander, Arthur Coningham. Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, commander of Mediterranean Air Command, preferred another candidate. Park was then slated to go to India as the air officer in charge of administration, but when the proposed appointment went to Churchill for approval, he preferred Park remain where he was for the time being.

===Middle East===
In January 1944, Park was promoted to air marshal and appointed air officer commander-in-chief of RAF Middle East Command, taking the role over from Sholto Douglas on Tedder&#x27;s recommendation. Park arrived in Cairo on 6 January; his new post was subordinate to the RAF command structure for the Mediterranean and Middle East, led by Air Marshal John Slessor. Although Park&#x27;s appointment was quickly criticised by Slessor, on the grounds that the RAF would lose influence in the region to the British Army, little weight was placed on his views as he was known to be very opinionated on matters about which that he often knew little. Portal and Tedder maintained their confidence in Park, as did Churchill. Park&#x27;s duties in Cairo extended to the supervision of air operations in the eastern portion of the Mediterranean, as well as the Indian Ocean. He was also responsible for the training of RAF personnel in Egypt, Cyprus, Palestine and South Africa. 

Partway through the year, Park was considered by the Australian government for command of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), because of the rivalry between its &quot;de jure&quot; head, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, and Jones&#x27;s nominal subordinate, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, in charge of RAAF operations in the Pacific. The Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, discussed the matter with Churchill and Portal in August, but to no avail. In any case, General Douglas MacArthur, the American commander of the South West Pacific Area, said it was too late in the war to make such changes.

===Far East===
In the New Year Honours, announced on 1 January 1945, Park was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). Soon afterwards, he was appointed Allied Air Commander, South-East Asia Command (ACSEAC); Air Vice Marshal Charles Medhurst took over Park&#x27;s role at Middle East Command. ACSEAC was a sought-after posting, and Slessor had agitated for the appointment. Portal deemed Park better suited to the role, given his operational experience. After he was invested with his KCB at Buckingham Palace by King George VI on 14 February, he and his wife departed the United Kingdom for Calcutta to take up his post, replacing Air Marshal Guy Garrod.

Once in his new command, one of Park&#x27;s tasks was ensuring the aerial provision of General William Slim&#x27;s 14th Army, which was advancing through Burma to Rangoon. Many of his aircraft were engaged for several weeks dropping over 1,900 tons of supplies on a daily basis to the advancing British troops. One of Park&#x27;s concerns was the British Army&#x27;s lack of urgency in repairing airfields captured by the 14th Army as it moved towards Rangoon. Bringing these into service would have allowed him to shorten the flight times for the supply aircraft flying from their bases in India. It would often take several weeks after their capture before the airfields were operational, a delay Park believed would have been much greater if not for his urging. He also maintained his longstanding practice of visiting the RAF stations of his command, despite its wide range, which extended from Kandy, where he was initially based until shifting to Singapore, northwest to Quetta, south to the Cocos Islands and Hong Kong to the northeast.

Newly promoted to air chief marshal, on 12 September Park was present in his capacity as ACSEAC for the formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region, the ceremony being held in Singapore. In the aftermath of the Japanese surrender, Park&#x27;s duties shifted to repatriating around 125,000 Allied internees, military and civilian, from prisons in the South East Asia region. To supplement his resources for this work, he impressed Japanese aircraft and personnel into service. There was also the matter of returning British soldiers and airmen to the United Kingdom, which required coordination with Transport Command as well as his own ACSEAC. The rate of return of RAF personnel was of particular concern as a proportion were required to fly and maintain the transports; this meant that more jobs in the civilian sector were going to former soldiers and sailors. Park sought to shorten the term of service to three years for single men, and this came into effect in April 1946.

==Postwar service==
In late November 1945, Park&#x27;s headquarters transferred to Singapore, which in the postwar period was to be developed as an air base. Morale, due to the rate of repatriation of RAF personnel, continued to be a problem in the early part of the following year, and Park had to speak to several groups of dissatisfied men. Sympathetic to their concerns, he emphasised to his officers the need for pastoral care of the men under their command. Despite this, there were several instances of RAF personnel in SEAC refusing to work; as these involved conscripts, Park did not have to treat them as mutineers. In one instance, he blamed the commander of the unit for not ensuring his men&#x27;s wellbeing.

Park was also engaged writing formal dispatches regarding operations carried out by SEAC. In his early drafts he was critical of the British land forces&#x27; ability to support the ground organisation required for his transport aircraft, and also emphasised the importance of air supply operations to the success achieved in the region. He toned down his writings in response to feedback from the War Office.

In February 1946, Park, looking ahead to his impending replacement as ACSEAC by his deputy, Air Marshal Guy Pirie, in late April, sought permission for leave in New Zealand before taking up his next post. Tedder advised that there was no envisaged role for Park in the RAF, preference being given to younger men. This greatly disappointed Park. For much of April, he was acting Supreme Allied Commander of South-East Asia while Lord Mountbatten was in Australia; this was the most senior command that Park held during his military career. The following month, after a recommendation by Mountbatten, Park was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath (GCB) &quot;in recognition for distinguished services in South East Asia&quot;.

After recovering from a bout of dysentery, Park and his wife departed Singapore to commence their tour of New Zealand on 26 May. Park had not been to the country for over 31 years and it was the first visit for his wife. While there he saw family and friends and was the guest of honour at several civic functions throughout the country. He had been asked by the Air Ministry to meet with representatives of the RNZAF to discuss its postwar plans and needs. He reported back that there was an intention to align with the RAF on equipment and processes.

By August, Park was back in the United Kingdom and the following month received official notice of his impending retirement from the RAF. Taking into account leave he had been granted for his overseas service, he was retired with effect from 20 December 1946 and with the rank of air chief marshal. He was not entitled to the pension that came with this rank. Despite the advocacy of Tedder, Mountbatten and Slessor, the Treasury would not pay the full amount and he instead received an amount equivalent to that due to an air marshal, plus a third of the difference between this and the pension due an air chief marshal. 

One of his final official engagements was a visit to Buckingham Palace, where he received the insignia of the GCB from King George VI on 16 October. He was also recognised by the United States for his work during the Second World War, being appointed a Commander of the Legion of Merit in 1947.

==Later life==
Almost immediately after his retirement, Park became a representative of the Hawker Siddeley Group, which manufactured military and civilian aircraft. He was tasked with selling aviation equipment to countries in South America, aided by his previous experience in the region. He met the president of Argentina, Juan Perón, in early 1947, and a contract was subsequently signed later in the year for 380 Gloster Meteor jet fighters and 30 Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. By May he was back in England before he and his wife, along with one of their two sons, went to New Zealand. There, based in Auckland, he was Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s Pacific representative.

Park was largely frustrated in his efforts to sell his employer&#x27;s aircraft in New Zealand as there was a preference for those made by American manufacturers. He was occasionally critical of the purchasing decisions of the New Zealand government, which embarrassed Hawker Siddeley. In one case, he noted that while some pilots of the RNZAF still had to make do with antiquated North American P-51D Mustangs and de Havilland Vampires, the air forces of less developed countries were equipped with modern Hawker Hunter jet fighters.

Park was also involved in the establishment of Auckland International Airport at Māngere. He had already highlighted the importance of such a facility to the Auckland business community. He had received feedback from Sholto Douglas, now a director of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, that New Zealand&#x27;s airfields were particularly poor. In 1951, Park was named chairman of the International Airport Committee and for the next few years worked towards obtaining the necessary land and cooperation from both central and local government.

In 1951, Park&#x27;s son Ian, a constable with the police force in British Malaya, was killed in the line of duty. Ian&#x27;s death was upsetting for both parents, but Park was better able to move on with life while his wife struggled to come to terms with the loss of her son.

In 1955, the same year that he stepped down from the International Airport Committee, Park&#x27;s connections and advocacy with the Air Ministry resulted in the donation of a Spitfire to the Auckland War Memorial Museum. It was an aircraft that he personally selected while on a visit to the United Kingdom that year. The donated Spitfire, a Mk XVI, which had been used in the filming of &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;, arrived at the museum the following year and Park gave an address at its formal unveiling. The aircraft remains on display in one of the museum&#x27;s galleries.

Park&#x27;s lack of diplomacy, together with his age, ultimately led to his retirement from Hawker Siddeley in June 1960. Soon afterward, encouraged by the city&#x27;s mayor at the time, Sir Dove-Myer Robinson, Park stood for election for the Auckland City Council. He was elected for a three-year term in the 1962 local elections, and went on to be reelected for two more terms. As a councillor he found himself again involved with the international airport at Māngere, being on the committee supervising the construction of some of its infrastructure. The airport began international operations in 1966 and, for a time, acquaintances of Park moved to have it named after him; the government declined to do so. In the final year of his last term as councillor, his wife, Lady Dorothy, who had been unwell for some time, died.

A film of the Battle of Britain was released in 1969, based on the book &quot;The Narrow Margin&quot; by Derek Wood and Derek Dempster. Produced by Harry Saltzman, the film was intended to be an accurate representation of the battle. Before production commenced, Trevor Howard, the actor cast as Park, wrote to him with assurances of doing justice to his leadership of No. 11 Group. On viewing the finished film at its premiere in New Zealand, Park found it entertaining but noted the meeting in which he and Leigh-Mallory argued over the use of Big Wings was fictionalised and less dramatic than what had actually occurred.

==Death==
In his later years Park suffered a series of heart attacks. He took ill in Auckland on 2 February 1975 and was admitted to hospital, where he died on 6 February, aged 82. Park was accorded a military funeral, the service being held at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Parnell. Condolences were sent by Elizabeth II and also Battle of Britain pilot Johnny Kent. His remains were cremated and, at the request of his surviving son, his ashes scattered over Waitemata Harbour from an aircraft. 

Later that year, on 12 September, a memorial service was held in London at St Clement Danes on the Strand. One of the speakers was Douglas Bader, who during his speech noted: &quot;British military history of this century has been enriched with the names of great fighting men from New Zealand. Keith Park&#x27;s name is carved into that history alongside those of his peers.&quot;

==Legacy==

In New Zealand, Park is commemorated by the Sir Keith Park Memorial Airfield in Thames and at the aviation section of the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland, the gate guardian of which is a replica of the Hurricane which Park flew while commanding No. 11 Group. The machine is not an accurate representation, as it has a stripe around the rear of the fuselage in duck-egg green, which was not introduced until the spring of 1941, by which time he was commanding Training Command. The Sir Keith Park Special School in Māngere, South Auckland, bears his name. In 2019, a bronze statue of Park was unveiled outside the Thames War Memorial Civic Centre. The statue was funded by a $200,000 bequest from Betty Hare, who felt that Park deserved greater recognition in his homeland.

Park&#x27;s uniform and medals, among them the 1939–1945 Star, are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Despite the physical presence of a Battle of Britain clasp on his 1939-45 Star, until recently Park&#x27;s name was not on the official list of aircrew who were entitled to the clasp. After an investigation by historian Dilip Sarkar, Park&#x27;s name was added to the list on the basis of having made at least one operational sortie during the battle.

In the United Kingdom, Keith Park Crescent, a residential road near the former RAF station at Biggin Hill, is named after him, as is Keith Park Road in Uxbridge.

A Southern Railway (Great Britain) West Country Class/Battle of Britain Class locomotive, No. 34053 was named after him in 1947, Park being present at its dedication ceremony. The locomotive has survived into preservation, and has been restored from scrapyard condition. Rededicated to Park in 2013, the locomotive is presently owned by Southern Locomotives Ltd and based on the Spa Valley Railway.

Thanks to the advocacy of financier Terry Smith, on 4 November 2009 a temporary tall fibreglass statue of Park was unveiled on the Fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. This was in recognition of his role in the Battle of Britain. Members of Park&#x27;s family were present for the unveiling, which occurred in front of 1,000 people. It remained on display for six months before being moved to the Royal Air Force Museum in London in May 2010.

A more permanent recognition for Park in London was still desired and in May 2009 the Westminster City Council agreed to erect a tall statue in Waterloo Place. A bronze version of the sculpture displayed on the Fourth plinth was installed at Waterloo Place and unveiled there on 15 September 2010, during the 70th anniversary commemorations of the Battle. Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton, said that Park was &quot;a man without whom the history of the Battle of Britain could have been disastrously different. He was a man who never failed at any task he was given.&quot;

<doc id="266991" wikidata="Q1369224" url="?curid=266991" title="Whitley Strieber">
<text>Louis Whitley Strieber (; born June 13, 1945) is an American writer best known for his horror novels &quot;The Wolfen&quot; and &quot;The Hunger&quot; and for &quot;Communion&quot;, a non-fiction account of his alleged experiences with non-human entities. He has maintained a dual career of author of fiction and advocate of paranormal concepts through his best-selling non-fiction books, his Unknown Country web site, and his podcast, Dreamland.

==Early life and education==
Strieber was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Kathleen Mary (Drought) and Karl Strieber, a lawyer. He attended Central Catholic High School in San Antonio, Texas. He was educated at the University of Texas at Austin and the London School of Film Technique, graduating from each in 1968. He then worked for several advertising firms in New York City, rising to the level of vice president before leaving in 1977 to pursue a writing career.

==Early fiction==
Strieber began his career as a novelist with the horror novels &quot;The Wolfen&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1981), both of which were made into feature films, followed by the less successful horror novels &quot;Black Magic&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Night Church&quot; (1983).

Strieber then turned to speculative fiction with social conscience. Collaborating with James Kunetka, he wrote &quot;Warday&quot; (1984), about the dangers of limited nuclear warfare, and &quot;Nature&#x27;s End&quot; (1986), a novel about environmental apocalypse. He independently authored &quot;Wolf of Shadows&quot; (1985), a young adult novel set in the aftermath of a nuclear war.

In 1986, Strieber&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Catmagic&quot; was published with co-authorship credited to Jonathan Barry, who was billed as an aerospace industry consultant and a practicing witch. In the 1987 paperback edition, Strieber states that Jonathan Barry is fictitious and that he is the sole author of &quot;Catmagic&quot;. Strieber&#x27;s personal publishing company, Walker &amp; Collier, is named after two characters in &quot;Catmagic&quot;.

Later, less successful thrillers by Strieber include &quot;Billy&quot; (1990), &quot;The Wild&quot; (1991), &quot;Unholy Fire&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Forbidden Zone&quot; (1993).

==Short stories==

The author&#x27;s short stories were collected in the 1997 limited edition volume &quot;Evenings with Demons&quot;. More recent short stories include &quot;The Good Neighbor&quot;, published in &quot;Twilight Zone: 19 Original Stories on the 50th Anniversary&quot;, and &quot;The Christmas Spirits&quot; (2012), a modern retelling of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

==&quot;Communion&quot; and &quot;the visitors&quot;==
Strieber states that he was abducted from his cabin in upstate New York on the evening of December 26, 1985, by non-human beings. He wrote about this experience and related experiences in &quot;Communion&quot; (1987), his first non-fiction book. Although the book is perceived generally as an account of alien abduction, Strieber draws no conclusions about the identity of the alleged abductors. He refers to the beings as &quot;the visitors&quot;, a name chosen to be as neutral as possible to entertain the possibility that they are not extraterrestrials. Neurologist Steven Novella remarks that the details of Whitley&#x27;s tale of waking up seemingly paralyzed fits the description of hypnagogia, a fairly common neurological phenomenon that has been mistaken by some for an intervention by demons or aliens.

Both the hardcover and paperback edition of &quot;Communion&quot; reached the number one position on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list (non-fiction), with more than 2 million copies collectively sold.

Although it was published as non-fiction, the book editor of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; pronounced the follow-up title, &quot;Transformation&quot; (1988), to be fiction and removed it from the non-fiction best-seller list (it nonetheless made the top 10 on the fiction side of the chart). &quot;It&#x27;s a reprehensible thing,&quot; Strieber responded. &quot;My book is a true story ... Placing this book on the fiction list is an ugly example of exactly the kind of blind prejudice that has hurt human progress for many generations.&quot; Criticism noting the similarity between the non-human beings in Strieber&#x27;s autobiographical accounts and the non-human beings in his initial horror novels was typically acknowledged by the author as a fair observation, but not indicative of his autobiographical works being fictional: &quot;The mysterious small beings that figure prominently in &quot;Catmagic&quot; seem to be an unconscious rendering of [the visitors], created before I was aware that they may be real.&quot;

Since the 1987 publication of &quot;Communion&quot;, Strieber wrote four additional autobiographies detailing his experiences with the visitors: &quot;Transformation&quot; (1988), a direct follow-up; &quot;Breakthrough: The Next Step&quot; (1995), a reflection on the original events and accounts of the sporadic contact he&#x27;d subsequently experienced; &quot;The Secret School&quot; (1996), in which he examines strange memories from his childhood; and lastly, &quot;Solving the Communion Enigma: What Is to Come&quot; (2011).

In &quot;Solving the Communion Enigma&quot;, Strieber reflects on how advances in scientific understanding since his 1987 publication may shed light on what he perceived, noting, &quot;Among other things, since I wrote &quot;Communion&quot;, science has determined that parallel universes may be physically real and that time travel may in some way be possible&quot;. The book is a consolidation of UFO sightings and related phenomena, including crop circles, alien abductions, mutilations and deaths in an attempt to discern any kind of meaningful overall pattern. Strieber concludes that the human species is being shepherded to a higher level of understanding and existence within an endless &quot;multiverse&quot; of matter, energy, space and time. He also writes more candidly about the deleterious effects his initial experiences had upon him while staying at his upstate New York cabin in the 1980s, noting, &quot;I was regularly drinking myself to sleep when we were there. I would listen to the radio until late hours, drinking vodka...&quot;

Other visitor-themed books of Strieber&#x27;s include &quot;Majestic&quot; (1989), a novel about the Roswell UFO incident; &quot;The Communion Letters&quot; (1997, reissued in 2003), a collection of letters from readers reporting experiences similar to Strieber&#x27;s; &quot;Confirmation&quot; (1998), in which Strieber reviews a variety of evidence that is suggestive of alien contact, and considers what more would be required to provide &#x27;confirmation&#x27;; &quot;The Grays&quot; (2006) a novel in which his impressions of alien contact are presented through a fictional thriller/espionage narrative, and; &quot;Hybrids&quot; (2011) a fictional narrative that imagines human/alien hybrids being born into the modern world.

Additional visitor-themed writings include a screenplay for the 1989 film &quot;Communion&quot;, directed by Philippe Mora and starring Christopher Walken as Strieber. The movie covers material from the books &quot;Communion&quot; and &quot;Transformation&quot;. Strieber has stated that he was dissatisfied with the film, which utilized scenes of improvised dialogue and includes themes not present in his books. Strieber also wrote a screenplay for his novel &quot;Majestic&quot;, which to date has not been filmed.

Whitley Strieber has repeatedly expressed frustration that his experiences have been taken as &quot;alien contact&quot; when he does not actually know what they were. Strieber has reported anomalous childhood experiences and suggested that he may have suffered some sort of early interference by intelligence or military agencies.

He was extensively tested for temporal lobe epilepsy and other brain abnormalities at his own request, but his brain was found to be functioning normally. The results of these tests were reported in his book &quot;Transformation&quot;.

==The Whitman Massacre==

In &quot;Communion&quot;, Strieber wrote of having told friends over the years that he had witnessed the University of Texas tower shooting in Austin, Texas, on August 1, 1966, when he had in fact not been on campus that day:

Strieber presents his claim to have witnessed the Whitman shooting in &quot;Communion&quot; in the context of alien abduction screen memories, expressing puzzlement at having repeated this false claim over the years. In two interviews prior to &quot;Communion&quot;, however, Strieber described in graphic detail what he purportedly witnessed. In a 1985 interview with Douglas Winter published in &quot;Faces of Fear&quot;, Strieber described:

Critics including panelists on the British television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot; questioned Strieber about his statements in &quot;Communion&quot; about not having been at the Whitman shooting. Strieber announced that in his latest book, &quot;Transformation&quot;, he had changed his mind and decided he had witnessed the shooting. Despite this, according to public information, no &quot;little boy on a bicycle&quot; was killed by Whitman that day. Further, according to Ed Conroy in his &quot;Report on Communion&quot;, Strieber&#x27;s mother stated during an interview that Strieber had been in Austin the day of the shooting, but not on campus.

==The Master of the Key==
In 2001, Strieber self-published a book titled &quot;The Key,&quot; in which he claimed that while on a book tour for his book &quot;Confirmation&quot;, he was visited in the early morning of June 6, 1998, at his Toronto hotel room by an unknown man who presented him with a &quot;new image of God&quot;. Strieber engaged the man in dialogue for &quot;half an hour,&quot; though Strieber also conceded that &quot;once our conversation was transcribed, it became obvious that more time was involved&quot; and &quot;he must have been with me for at least two hours&quot;. Subjects discussed included the Holocaust, sudden climate change, the afterlife, psychic ability, UFOs, and using the human soul in machines. According to Strieber, the man did not give his name, and in the book Strieber refers to him as Master of the Key. While he was writing the book, Strieber said that unlike other events he had experienced &quot;the reality of this one isn&#x27;t in question.&quot;

In the section of &quot;The Key&quot; entitled &quot;The Conversation&quot;, Strieber presented a transcription of the conversation which Strieber has claimed is &quot;80 to 90 percent accurate&quot;, &quot;90% accurate or more&quot;. In 2011, Tarcher/Penguin printed a new edition of &quot;The Key&quot;, which contained significant differences from the version of the transcription contained in Strieber&#x27;s original Walker &amp; Collier edition. In response, Strieber alleged that his own 2001 self-published edition had been &quot;censored&quot; by &quot;sinister forces&quot;.

==Current works==
Whitley Strieber is currently the host of the spiritual and science-themed podcast &quot;Dreamland&quot;, available on a weekly basis from his website, Unknown Country. The program was a former companion show to &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, with both shows founded by broadcaster Art Bell, before being taken on by Strieber in 1999.

Strieber has also continued writing novels, including &quot;The Last Vampire&quot; (2001), and &quot;Lilith&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2003), both being sequels to his 1981 vampire novel &quot;The Hunger&quot;. As well, he has authored &quot;2012: The War For Souls&quot; (2007), a horror novel about an interdimensional invasion, and &quot;Critical Mass&quot; (2009), a thriller about nuclear terrorism. Strieber also co-authored the graphic novel &quot;The Nye Incidents&quot; (2008), along with co-authors Craig Spector and Guss Floor.

His novel &quot;The Omega Point&quot; is &quot;based on a hidden connection between 2012 and the Book of Revelation&quot;. This title, released in 2010, is Strieber&#x27;s second novel dealing with the subject of 2012, the first being &quot;2012: The War for Souls&quot;.

An entry in the popular teen-lit genre, &quot;Melody Burning&quot;, was published in late 2011. The story centers on a feral teenager who lives within a skyrise building unnoticed, and a new tenant, a pop-star named Melody, with whom he falls in love.

In 2012, Strieber began an alien-themed thriller series called &quot;Alien Hunter&quot;, the first volume of which was published in August 2013. A series based on the book was released by SyFy in April 2016 and called &quot;Hunters&quot;.
The second volume in the series, &quot;Alien Hunter: Underworld&quot;, was published in August 2014.

In March 2014, Strieber and his wife Anne published an account of her illness called Miraculous Journey. Mrs. Strieber experienced a cerebral hemorrhage in 2004 and in 2013 underwent treatment for a brain tumor.

Strieber collaborated with religious scholar Jeffrey J. Kripal on 2016&#x27;s &quot;Super Natural: A New Vision of the Unexplained&quot;, a study of occultism, supernatural experiences, and parapsychology that explores &quot;why the supernatural is neither fantasy nor fiction but a vital and authentic aspect of life&quot;.

==Media appearances==
In November 1989, Strieber made an extended appearance on the British television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot; alongside, among others, astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

The following year on February 4, 1990, Strieber made an Irish appearance on RTÉ’s Kenny Live to discuss his experience of alien abduction.

Strieber, and perhaps his wife Anne, made a cameo appearance in the 2009 movie &quot;Race to Witch Mountain&quot;.

Television appearances during the publication of &quot;Communion&quot; were numerous and included &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot;. He has made appearances (including a 2006 interview on the &quot;Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;) in support of his newer novels.

He has been featured many times on the overnight radio show Coast to Coast AM, both as guest and guest-host. On April 6, 2013, he did a two-hour interview with John B. Wells.

In 2022, Strieber appeared in the upcoming documentary, Alien Abduction: Answers.

==Cultural influences==
In an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot;, the cover of the book &quot;From Outer Space&quot; is a parody of the cover of &quot;Communion&quot; (the difference being that the alien on the cover is depicted smoking a cigarette).

The post-punk dance music group The Mekano Set cite Whitley Strieber&#x27;s non-fiction work as an influence on their work. They wrote a tribute to Strieber for their 2013 album The Three Thieves (a reference to characters from Strieber&#x27;s novel The Grays) entitled What is it Whit?

The closing track of U.N.K.L.E. debut album &quot;Psyence Fiction&quot; (1998) features vocals from Whitley Strieber, taken from a weekend edition of Art Bell’s Coast to Coast AM nightly radio talk show.

&quot;Communion&quot; was shown in the episode Love Language of the first season of the series &quot;Resident Alien&quot;.

==Personal life==
Whitley Strieber is associated with the Gurdjieff Foundation. He left regular work in the Foundation shortly before the experiences reported in &quot;Communion&quot; but remains involved in the mystical teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky and makes frequent references to them in his non-fiction writings.

Strieber was married to Anne Strieber until her death in 2015. According to his website, he lives in California as of April 2019.

<doc id="266998" wikidata="Q131402" url="?curid=266998" title="Munich Airport">
<text>Munich Airport () is an international airport serving Munich and Upper Bavaria. To the German Aeronautical Information Publication, it is known as &quot;Muenchen Airport&quot;. It is the second-busiest airport in Germany in terms of passenger traffic after Frankfurt Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport in Europe, handling 47.9 million passengers in 2019. It is the world&#x27;s 15th-busiest airport in terms of international passenger traffic, and was the 38th-busiest airport worldwide in 2018. It serves as hub for Lufthansa including its subsidiaries Lufthansa CityLine, Lufthansa City Airlines, Air Dolomiti and Eurowings as well as a base for Condor and TUI fly Deutschland.

The airport is located northeast of Munich, near the town of Freising. It is named after former Bavarian minister-president Franz Josef Strauss. It has two passenger terminals with an additional midfield terminal, two runways as well as extensive cargo and maintenance facilities and is fully equipped to handle wide-body aircraft including the Airbus A380.

== History ==
=== Development ===
Munich&#x27;s previous airport, Munich-Riem Airport, was operational from 1939 to 1992. Initial plans for an expansion of the airport date back to the year 1954. With rising passenger numbers and a growing number of inhabitants in its proximity, plans were made to completely move the airport to another site. The Bavarian government took the decision to build a new airport in the area called &quot;Erdinger Moos&quot; on 5 August 1969. When construction started on 3 November 1980, the small village of Franzheim disappeared and its approximately 400 inhabitants were resettled. The airport is located on the territory of four different municipalities: Oberding (location of the terminals; district of Erding), Hallbergmoos, Freising, and Marzling in the district of Freising.

The new Munich airport commenced operations on 17 May 1992, and all flights to and from Munich were moved to the new site overnight. Munich-Riem closed on 16 May 1992 shortly before midnight.

The airport is named after Franz Josef Strauss, who played a prominent, albeit sometimes controversial, role in West German politics from the 1950s until his death in 1988. Amongst other positions, Strauss was a long-time Minister-President (Governor) of the state of Bavaria. Strauss, a private pilot himself, initiated the new airport project and was particularly interested in attracting the aviation industry to Bavaria. He is regarded as one of the fathers of the Airbus project and served as initial chairman of the Airbus supervisory board.

Flughafen München GmbH, which owns and operates Munich Airport, is a limited liability company consisting of three shareholders: the State of Bavaria (51%), the Federal Republic of Germany (26%) and the City of Munich (23%). The logo of Munich Airport consists of the letter &quot;M&quot; with the slogan &quot;Living ideas – Connecting lives&quot;. Munich Airport is usually referred to as &quot;Flughafen München&quot; or simply &quot;MUC&quot;, its IATA code. During construction, the airport was referred to as &quot;Flughafen München II&quot;.

=== Operations ===
As their home base at Frankfurt Airport suffered from capacity limits back then, Lufthansa established a second hub, offering several short- and long-haul connections through Munich in addition to Frankfurt. While Lufthansa serves more European destinations from Munich Airport than from Frankfurt Airport, Frankfurt has many more intercontinental routes.

Between 1995 and 2006, passenger numbers doubled from under 15 million per annum to over 30 million, despite the impact of the 11 September attacks in 2001 and 2002. In 1996 the airport overtook Düsseldorf as Germany&#x27;s second-busiest airport and currently handles almost twice as many passengers as the country&#x27;s third-busiest airport.

In June 2003, construction of Terminal 2 was completed, and it was inaugurated as an exclusive facility for Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners.

In November 2013, the airport introduced its first new corporate design since its inauguration. The large letter &#x27;M&#x27; remains in a new font type, and a dash has been added which changes between several colors. There are also animated color-changing versions of the &#x27;M&#x27;-sign placed throughout the airport area, for example on the main entrance road and on the new Terminal 2 satellite.

In June 2015, Condor announced it intends to establish a long-haul base at Munich Airport from the 2016 summer season. Condor has already based short- and mid-haul operations at the airport, and resumed long-haul flights in winter 2013 after a six-year absence. In November 2015, Transavia announced their intention to establish their first German base at Munich Airport, which will consist of four aircraft serving 18 new routes by spring 2016. As of June 2015, the biggest foreign carrier in Munich in terms of passenger numbers is Air Dolomiti.

More than 40 million passengers passed through the airport in 2015, a record at the time.

In December 2016, Lufthansa&#x27;s low-cost subsidiary Eurowings announced that it would establish a major base at Munich Airport from March 2017, with 32 new routes. These new base operations were carried out by Air Berlin on a new wet-lease contract with Eurowings. In February 2017, Transavia announced the closure of their entire base at Munich Airport by October 2017 after only a year of service due to a change in their business strategy and negative economic outlook.

Munich Airport&#x27;s growth continued in 2018 with an all-time high of 46.2 million passengers. The airport also saw 413,000 take-offs and landings, an increase of 2.2% above the prior year. With 266 destinations, Munich Airport increased its global network and is among the leading air transportation hubs in Europe.

In February 2021, Lufthansa announced it would take over most of Eurowings&#x27;s routes in Munich, with the exception of some domestic services and flights to Palma de Mallorca and Pristina.

== Terminals and facilities ==
=== Overview===
The airport covers of land. Most of the airport&#x27;s facilities are located in the area between the two runways. The approach road and railway divide the west part into a southern half, which contains cargo and maintenance facilities, and a northern half, which contains mostly administrative buildings and service facilities, a holiday long-term parking lot and the visitors&#x27; centre. It is followed by the west apron and Terminal 1, then the Munich Airport Center (MAC), Terminal 2 and the east apron. Munich Airport has two passenger terminals, and shuffled 20–25 million people through each terminal in 2014.
=== Terminal 1 ===
Terminal 1 is the older terminal and commenced operation when the airport was opened on 17 May 1992. It has a total capacity of 25 million passengers per year and is subdivided into five &quot;modules&quot; designated A, B, C, D and E. Modules A through D provide all facilities necessary to handle departures and arrivals, including individual landside driveways and parking, whereas module E is equipped to handle arrivals only. This design essentially makes each module a self-contained sub-terminal of its own. Modules A and D are used for flights within the Schengen-area, while modules B and C handle those to destinations outside it. Hall F is separate, located near Terminal 2, and handles flights with increased security requirements, i.e. those to Israel. Furthermore, the check-in counters for some flights departing from Terminal 1 are located in the central area Z () where most of the shopping and restaurant facilities of this Terminal as well as the airport&#x27;s suburban railway station are also located.

The pier features 21 jet bridges, two of which have been rebuilt into waiting halls for bus transfers. One gate position has been equipped with three jet bridges to handle the Airbus A380 which is regularly used by Emirates. There are further 60 aircraft stands on the apron, some of which are equipped with specially designed apron jet bridges (), to which passengers are brought by bus. This unique concept allows passengers to board with full protection from the weather but without the high investment required for full satellite terminals connected through a passenger transport system.

Terminal 1 currently handles all airlines that are not members or partners of the Star Alliance with the exception of Turkish Airlines. However, owing to lack of capacity at Terminal 2, Lufthansa&#x27;s subsidiary Germanwings and former affiliate Condor both moved back to Terminal 1 in 2007. Germanwings however moved back to Terminal 2 in late 2015. Some of the major users at Terminal 1 are American Airlines, Condor, Delta Air Lines, easyJet, Eurowings, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and TUI fly Deutschland amongst several others.

==== Terminal 1 extension ====
As of December 2015, a major redesign of Terminal 1 including a capacity increase and an extension of the central terminal building to the west for centralised security and shopping facilities was under preparation. In November 2016, a major €400m extension and refurbishment for Terminal 1 was announced. Terminal areas A and B will be entirely redesigned with the addition of a pier stretching out on the apron. The new facilities will provide capacity for 6 million additional passengers, will be able to handle 12 aircraft including two Airbus A380s at once, and were originally due to open by 2022. However, due to the sharp decrease in passenger traffic in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and a simultaneous sharp cost increase for the new terminal annex, the building&#x27;s shell will be finished by 2022 with a new estimated opening of 2025.

=== Terminal 2 ===
Terminal 2 commenced operation on 29 June 2003. It has a design capacity of 25 million passengers per year and is exclusively used by Lufthansa and all other Star Alliance members serving Munich except Turkish Airlines. Luxair also uses Terminal 2. Etihad Airways has shifted back to Terminal 1 effective from 1 June 2023.

Having been designed as a hub terminal, it is not divided into modules like Terminal 1. Instead, all facilities are arranged around a central &quot;Plaza&quot;. Owing to security regulations imposed by the European Union, the terminal has been equipped with facilities to handle passengers from countries considered insecure, i.e. not implementing the same regulations. This required the construction of a new level as, unlike other airports, the terminal does not have separate areas for arriving and departing passengers. The new level 06 opened on 15 January 2009.

The pier, which is long, is equipped with 24 jet bridges. As the total number of 75 aircraft stands on the east apron is not always sufficient, Terminal 2 sometimes also uses parking positions on the west apron, to which passengers are carried by airside buses. Terminal 2 is able to handle the Airbus A380 as well, however, prior to the opening of the Terminal 2 satellite building, there were no designated stands or additional jet bridges for it. Lufthansa flies the A380 into the satellite building.

Terminal 2 has two main departure levels, 04 and 05 and additional bus gates on the lower level 03. Gates on level 05 (H) are designated non-Schengen gates. Until the new transfer level 06 opened, the northernmost gates were behind an additional security checkpoint for departures to the USA most of the day. The lower level 04 (G) contains Schengen gates. The bus gates on level 03 are also designated G and are also used for Schengen flights. Level 03 is smaller than the main levels and consists of two separate parts which can be reached from two points on level 04. One area of these gates is designated to Air Dolomiti.

The terminal is operated by &quot;Terminal-2-Betriebsgesellschaft&quot; (German for &quot;Terminal 2 Operating Company&quot;), which is owned by Flughafen München GmbH (60%) and Lufthansa (40%). This makes Terminal 2 the first terminal in Germany which is co-operated by an airline.

=== Terminal 2 Satellite ===

Terminal 2 was projected to reach its full capacity of handling 27.5 million passengers a year by 2013. Lufthansa and Star Alliance partners stipulated the expansion of Terminal 2 without constructing the separate facilities for luggage claim, arrival and departure levels, etc. This was to ensure the easy access for the passengers who appreciate the convenience of central plaza for checking in their luggage, going through the security screening, and such as well as transferring from one plane to other within Lufthansa and Star Alliance partner networks inside Terminal 2. After the completion of Terminal 2 in 2003, the preparations for a new satellite terminal already had been made.

The project cost is 650 million Euro with Munich Airport contributing 60% and Lufthansa 40% toward the project. The expansion would handle additional 11 million passengers per year. The construction was approved in 2010 and started in 2012. At end of 2015, the construction was completed, and the teams of volunteers performed the trial runs in January 2016 as to identify any potential issues and to streamline the movements between Terminal 2 and Terminal 2 Satellite. The satellite terminal was inaugurated on 22 April 2016 and commenced its operations on 26 April 2016.

The new satellite building is long with of floor space with 52 additional gates and 27 parking positions, 11 of which are able to handle wide-body aircraft, including Airbus A380. The building has separate access facilities for Schengen and Non-Schengen passengers on two main levels (K Level for Schengen and L for Non-Schengen destinations). The J section is for bus transportation between the terminal and aircraft parked at aprons. 44 new passport control stations and 24 security lanes for transfer passengers are installed in the terminal. Five new Lufthansa lounges along with new restaurants and shops are set up throughout the terminal. However, the satellite terminal is airside-only facility: the check-in, luggage claim, departure and arrival passenger meet points are still done at Terminal 2. The passenger transportation between Terminal 2 and Terminal 2 Satellite is served by fully automated people mover by Bombardier Transportation that operates in the tunnels. The satellite terminal celebrated its one millionth passenger in July 2016, less than three months after its opening.

A future expansion of the satellite building into a &#x27;T&#x27; shape has been planned along with a possible third terminal to the east. Lufthansa and Flughafen München GmbH (Munich Airport operator) signed a letter of intent on 16 December 2019 to expand Terminal 2 Satellite. The expansion will build a new terminal extending from the centre of Terminal 2 Satellite building at right angle toward the east. The Memorandum of Understanding from Flughafen München GmbH stipulates that both parties reach the goal of becoming a -neutral by 2030, utilising highly fuel-efficient aircraft. No further detail about number of gates along with construction and completion dates is given yet.

=== Munich Airport Center ===

The Munich Airport Center (&quot;MAC&quot;) is a shopping, business, and recreation area that connects the terminals. The older &quot;Central Area&quot; (), which was originally built as part of Terminal 1, hosts a shopping mall and the S-Bahn station. The newer &quot;MAC Forum&quot; built with Terminal 2 is a large outdoor area with a partly transparent tent-like roof. Next to it is the airport hotel managed by Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts which was designed by the world-famous architect Helmut Jahn and landscape architecture firm PWP Landscape Architecture in 1994.

The Munich Airport Center has a supermarket where one can shop from 5:30 a.m. to midnight every day, including Sundays, as it is exempt from the Bavarian law governing retail hours of operation ().

=== Runways ===
The airport has two parallel runways and one concrete helipad. The two concrete runways (08R/26L and 26R/08L) are each long and wide.

=== Parking areas ===

Currently, there are five parking garages and six underground parking areas, amounting together to a total of 30,000 parking spaces of which approximately 16,500 are under a roof. The parking garage P20 at Terminal 2, with 6,400 parking spaces on eleven levels (including four that are underground) since its commissioning in 2003 was the largest parking garage in Germany until the car park at the new Allianz Arena was opened in 2005. A parking guidance system was installed in the parking garages, which detects whether a parking space is occupied and newly arriving vehicles are shown where the empty parking spaces are located.

Apart from the usual parking facilities, the Munich Airport offers, at additional cost, special parking spaces with additional benefits. This includes valet parking, and the Park, Sleep &amp; Fly option, in which a night at the Hilton hotel is included. Also there is an option for oversized parking spaces and secure parking. Lastly, there is a special separate parking level in the P20 parking garage, where the parked cars are guarded. In addition, special services can be booked, such as interior/exterior cleaning and fuelling.

To make shopping in the public areas more attractive for local residents of the airport area, there are special offers where visitors can park up to three hours for free in the P20 parking garage. Short-term parking can be found east of the central area, where visitors can park for free for a maximum of thirty minutes. During the holiday periods other cheaper options are provided in the P8 parking garage.

=== Visitor viewing facilities ===

The airport authority have set out to cater for visitors and sightseers by creating a &#x27;Visitors Park&#x27; which includes a &#x27;Visitors Hill&#x27;, from which a good view of the westerly aircraft apron and Terminal 1 can be obtained, as well as a restaurant and a shop for aircraft models and other collectors&#x27; items with an adjacent children&#x27;s playground. Additionally, three historic aircraft are on display in the park, a Super Constellation, a Douglas DC-3, and a Junkers Ju 52. This location is served by Munich Airport Besucherpark station.

There is also a free visitors&#x27; viewing terrace on the roof of Terminal 2 that features a wide, glassed balcony with seating areas and gives a view of the easterly aircraft apron and the Terminal 2 satellite building. All visitors can access the terrace from the landside area of Terminal 2.

== Other facilities ==
* Lufthansa maintains a &quot;Flight Operations Center&quot; at the airport for crews based here at its secondary hub. In 2014, its subsidiary Lufthansa CityLine relocated their administration offices from Cologne to the grounds of Munich Airport. Additionally, there is a large Lufthansa Technik maintenance facility which can handle up to six Boeing 747s at once.
* There are two hotels directly on the airports grounds, the Hilton Munich Airport (which was the &quot;Kempinski Hotel Airport Munich&quot; until 31 December 2014) near Terminal 2 and a Novotel at the long-term parking area with several more in the nearby villages.
* German car manufacturer Audi established a large training facility for its retailers on the grounds of the airport in 2010. Designated areas near the apron are used for drive training.
* The defunct German airline DBA, originally Deutsche BA, had its head office on the grounds of the airport and in Hallbergmoos.
* The helicopter operations division of the Bavarian State police is based here.

== Environment ==

Since November 2005, the Munich Airport has a certified environmental management system according to DIN ISO 14001 and EMAS.

Munich Airport was involved in the Air Transport Initiative for Germany, which was also attended by Fraport, Deutsche Flugsicherung and Lufthansa. It developed a so-called &quot;four-pillar strategy&quot; with an overall concept designed to improve environmental protection; these four pillars include:

:&quot;Reduction of emissions through technological progress and innovation, particularly in the field of engine development; a more efficient infrastructure with a needs-based adaptation of airport capacity with concentration on the avoidance of, for example, polluting queues; operational measures such as the optimization of soil processes; economic incentives&quot;
:—Perspectives. Environmental Statement 2008 Munich Airport GmbH

=== Landscape ===
From the beginning, the state-administered parts of nature conservation aspects were considered in the planning of the airport. At the opening of the airport, 70% of the grounds were planted; today there are 925 of the 1,575 hectares which remained planted, only 60%. The prevalent Erdinger Moos area with its many intersecting small streams, and woodland series was taking into consideration in the planning by the landscape architect. At the same time, consideration was taken in making the airport unattractive to birds, in order to prevent bird strikes. An additional 230-acre green belt was placed around the airport as a compensation area, in which the overall compensation areas extend over 600 acres. Even with the focus on the environment, environmental groups criticize the enormous land consumption of the airport and each additional expansion project. Also, they believe that the compensation areas are insufficient to compensate for the damage caused by the airport (see below).

=== Water ===
The construction in the Erdinger Moos area had a large impact on the water budget of the region, since the groundwater levels in the marshy landscape had to be greatly reduced by creating drainage ditches. Existing watercourses, such as small streams, were not interrupted, but redirected so that they now run either around or underneath the property, limiting the effects of groundwater reduction to only the areas in which the airport is located.

The wastewater from the airport and the collected rain water are both returned to the natural water cycle. In order to accomplish this, 100 km of sewer lines were laid, and seven pumping stations, a water treatment plant and four rainwater sedimentation tanks were built and put into operation. The already rough cleansed water is then sent to a purification plant. For the necessary winter de-icing of the airport, used deicing chemicals such as glycol are collected together with the contaminated melted water, and then either purified or reused. The cleaning is done in the degradation system area, where soil bacteria decompose the glycol into harmless components of water and carbon dioxide.

=== Noise ===
;General
To reduce noise from thrust reversal during aircraft landings, the runways were built to a length of 4,000 meters, however the noise reduction is offset by increased taxiing times. To reduce noise pollution, a hall for engine testing was built. After 11 p.m. engine tests may be carried out only with the approval of air traffic control. To motivate airlines to use low-noise aircraft, the airport charges are calculated according to the level of noise pollution. There are 16 stationary noise measuring points at the airport.

;Night flight regulations
At Munich airport there is no strict ban on night flights, but a ban on flights arriving and departing between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.. The only exemptions are flights from mail services and DFS survey flights. From midnight until 5am only those flights that operate in the interest of the public are generally possible, this includes so-called emergency flights: police and rescue helicopter missions or medical emergencies. Also, aircraft movements for security reasons such as for precautionary landings are allowed at all times. Flights with special permission from the Bavarian Ministry for Economic Affairs, Infrastructure, Transport and Technology are also feasible at this time.

From 10 p.m. to midnight and 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. flights are possible through the so-called bonus list. Exceptions are delayed flights or premature landings if these aircraft are at least noise-admitted according to ICAO Chapter 3. In addition to both the bonus list and noise requirements they must fulfill further conditions, this includes that the airline must have a maintenance base at the airport, the maximum number of 28 scheduled flights per night (charter and scheduled services) must not be exceeded, the aircraft is not louder than 75 db (A) or it is an education or training flight.

This rule applies until the total annual volume is exhausted in air traffic movements by these regulations. More flights of this type are then no longer allowed. The number of night flights increased from 1999 to 2007 from 42 to 60 flights average per night.

Residents have been protesting for years against aircraft noise, in particular against the noise pollution at night. The Government of Upper Bavaria approved the night flight regulations currently in force in 2001.

=== Energy ===
;Cogeneration plant
Most of Munich airport&#x27;s electricity and heat is generated by its own cogeneration plant (CHP), which is located south of the northern runway to the west of the airport. CHP has nine so-called cogeneration modules, seven run on diesel fuel, the other two on gasoline. The electrical generating capacity is 18.5 megawatts. The cogeneration modules run smoothly all year long; this creates surplus heat at certain times which is stored in heat storage to be used later. In summer, the heat generated is used for the operation of the absorption refrigerating machine. The total gross utilization rate is 78 percent (diesel) and 83 percent (gasoline). The cogeneration modules are an obligation, from the Renewable Energy Sources Act, so that Munich Airport can generate electricity from renewable energy sources, using biogas. The airport also has a connection to the district heating network of the Zolling power plant.

;Photovoltaic system
There is a photovoltaic system on the roof of the central hall of terminal 2. It is a joint project of BP Solar, German BP, &quot;Bundesdeutscher Arbeitskreis für Umweltbewusstes Management&quot;, Lufthansa, Munich Airport and others. In operation since 10 July 2003, it generates an average of 445,000 kilowatt hours per year, equivalent to the consumption of 155 households. The power comes from 2,856 modules of silicon cells, covering a total area of 3,594 square metres. It is expected to save 12,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions over its 30-year lifetime. €2.65 million EUR were invested in the plant. The plant produces direct current, which after conversion to alternating current is initiated immediately in the power system. In Terminal 2, the energy currently generated is displayed on an overhead screen, which also displays other information.

;Biofuel gas station
A biofuel gas station supplying rapeseed oil fuels, ethanol fuel and biomethane has been established, making it possible for the operating companies to convert their vehicle fleets to biofuels; the station can also be used by external companies operating at the airport.

=== Bird sanctuary ===
Despite measures to prevent bird strikes, the northern part of Erdinger Moos is still an important habitat for birds, especially for grassland birds such as northern lapwing, Eurasian curlew or rare winter visitors such as the hen harrier. This led automatically to the area being reported under the European Birds Directive as a bird sanctuary.

The fencing of the airport and the large meadows inside the fence attract open meadow birds. This leads to constant conflicts and the deaths, even of rare birds as a result of airplane accidents (vortices) and safety measures to avoid bird strikes. The planned third runway 3,440,000 square metres in the bird sanctuary will be laid with concrete, eliminating 8,000,000 square metres of living space. This would represent substantial interference with the bird sanctuary.

== Safety ==
=== Police ===

For the safety of passengers and flight operations, four inspections by the Federal Police, departments of the Bavarian State Police (Police Inspection Munich Airport, PP Oberbayern Nord) and the security department of Flughafen München GmbH are responsible. The airport police station is located in Nordallee 6, and the police officers working there have an adapted qualification to the specific field of application, for example, they are also trained in the case of an aircraft hijacking. Bavaria&#x27;s police helicopter squad is also based at the Munich Airport, where five of the Eurocopter EC135 helicopters are stationed. A move of the unit to Schleißheim Airport is planned for 2020.

In addition, one of the world&#x27;s two chambers for explosive goods (the second one is located at Kuala Lumpur International Airport) is located on the airport grounds. In this chamber explosive substances can be defused.

=== Fire department ===

The airport has its own fire department with 32 fire engines distributed over two fire stations, which are located near the runways. They are positioned in a way that the emergency vehicles can reach every point of the apron, taxiway and runway in a maximum of three minutes, as long as no adverse weather conditions prevail. Should larger missions occur, the fire departments of the surrounding municipalities can be called in, which can provide up to 36 vehicles and about 216 men; in exchange, the airport fire department helps in large fires in the region. Most recently, this happened when a BMW plant in Eching went up in flames.
* The sum of the missions also includes other missions such as guided tours.

=== Ambulance service ===
Emergency medical care is provided by a rescue guard on Nordallee operated by the Malteser Hilfsdienst under a public service contract. A rescue vehicle is ready for use around the clock, which is also used outside the airport area for normal emergencies. If necessary, other rescue workers from the region or supraregional are used, the deployment coordination is carried out by the integrated control center which is also responsible for the area of the airport.

On the premises of the airport is an emergency physician from the medical center that arrives on the emergency site, when required, in a separate vehicle according to the rendezvous procedure.

== Ground transportation ==

=== Road ===
Munich Airport is accessible via nearby Motorway A 92, which connects to motorway A9 (towards Nuremberg) and Munich&#x27;s ring motorway A99. Bavarian State Road St. 2584 connects A 92&#x27;s exit 6 (&quot;Flughafen München&quot;)—an incomplete interchange that can only be used by traffic to and from the west—to the terminals. Access from the east is possible via exit 8 (&quot;Freising Ost&quot;) and Bavarian State Road St. 2580, which connects to St. 2584 in the east of the airport.

The north-southbound so-called &quot;Flughafentangente Ost&quot; ( literally: airport tangential road east) between A92 and A94 was finally opened in 2010 with a single lane in each direction. Originally, it was planned to be opened as expressway simultaneously with the new Airport. Gradually, the accident prone road shall be selectively upgraded from 2021 on to two alternating lanes per direction.

It can be reached by bicycle on national highway 301 (&quot;B301&quot;) and an airport road branching from this highway into the airport area.

=== Suburban railway ===

There are two railway stations on the grounds of Munich Airport: Munich Airport Terminal station is located in a tunnel directly beneath the central area between both passenger terminals. A second station called &quot;Besucherpark&quot; (German for &quot;Visitors&#x27; Park&quot;) is located in the area that contains the cargo and maintenance areas, long-term parking, administrative buildings and the Visitors&#x27; Park from which the station gets its name.

The airport is connected to the city by Munich suburban railway (&quot;S-Bahn&quot;) lines S1 and S8. The ride takes approximately 45 minutes to the Marienplatz station in the city centre. Line S1 runs from the airport through the northwestern suburbs and reaches the city centre from the west (Hauptbahnhof – Marienplatz – München Ost), while line S8 comes in from the eastern suburbs passing the stations from the opposite direction. The S-Bahn from the airport to the city runs approximately 20 hours a day with a short break between 1:30 a.m. and 4 a.m.

Furthermore, a scheduled regional bus service 635 connects the airport within 20 minutes to the Freising railway station, providing access to regional trains towards Munich as well as to Nuremberg, Regensburg and Prague.

A second tunnel beneath the terminals is currently unused. Originally, there were plans to use it for intercity railway, then for a Transrapid maglev train making the trip to München Hauptbahnhof in 10 minutes. However, this project was cancelled in March 2008 due to cost escalation. Discussions regarding a faster connection between Munich city centre and the airport have fruitlessly taken place for several years, as the journey time of 40–60 minutes faces ongoing criticism. Even a rudimentary express suburban railway service is not in sight.

==== Regional railway services ====
As of September 2015, construction works to connect the airport with regional railway services of Deutsche Bahn to and from the north-east had started. This project, called &quot;Neufahrner Kurve&quot; (&quot;Neufahrn curve&quot; after the nearby town of Neufahrn bei Freising), saw the existing southwest-bound S-Bahn tracks being expanded with a curve leading to the north, connecting them with the already existing tracks of the Munich-Regensburg line. This new connection enabled hourly regional express train services from Regensburg via Landshut directly to the airport without the need to use a connecting bus coming from the north or to go to Munich city center at first and then backtracking to the airport. The entire project was completed in November 2018. On 9 December 2018, the new hourly service, &quot;Flughafenexpress&quot; (&quot;airport express&quot;) between Regensburg and Munich Airport commenced.

=== Bus ===
MVV regional bus lines connect the airport to the nearby city of Freising as well as Erding and Markt Schwaben. Lufthansa Airport Bus provides an alternative to the S-Bahn, stopping at &quot;Nordfriedhof&quot; U-Bahn station and Munich Central Station.

INVG proposes a direct express coach service between the airport and Ingolstadt; during the summer season an hourly service is offered whereas a less frequent timetable-based service is proposed during the remainder of the year. Stops served at the airport are terminal 2 and the centrally located Airport Center. In Ingolstadt the service serves Ingolstadt Nord station, which allows connection to regional rail services including to and from Nuremberg.

== Future ==
=== Improvements in public transport ===
At the beginning of the 1990s, the Deutsche Bundesbahn considered four options for a better railway connection to the airport. At an estimated cost of between 500 million and 2 billion Deutsche Mark, each option would have allowed the airport to be integrated into the ICE network. However, the idea was rejected and instead emphasis was put on a better connection of the airport to regional transportation as well as to Munich main station.

==== Airport Express (S-Bahn) ====
After the cancellation of Transrapid proposal, several alternative proposals had been put forward that would utilise the current railway system with minor technical upgrades.

One proposal called &quot;Humpel-Express&quot; would utilise the most of current Munich-Regensburg railway and S1 lines with very limited stops along the route. The &quot;Humpel-Express&quot; would travel at and depart the Central Station and Munich Airport at 15-minute interval. The biggest issue was frequent level crossing closures at Fasanerie and Feldmoching (total of 39 minutes for every hour), causing severe traffic congestions. Additionally, the construction of new line between Moosach and Munich Airport would cut through several towns and neighbourhoods, which the residents vehemently opposed. The new line also required the construction of new viaduct over the federal highway B471, increasing the cost further. The opposition from the resident and unwillingness to allot additional funding killed the proposal.

With the Second S-Bahn Tunnel under construction, the proposed Airport Express service will peruse second S-Bahn tunnel upon completion with one stop, instead of four, at Marienhof between Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof. This would reduce the travel time between Hauptbahnhof and Munich Airport to 30 minutes. Additionally, Deutsche Bahn has proposed the underground four-track S-Bahn tunnel from Leuchtenbergring to Halbergmoos S-Bahn stations. This would eliminate the need to slow down before passing through the intervening stations and the need to close the level crossings frequently. If the four-track extension is approved and constructed, the travel time would be reduced further to 15–18 minutes.

==== Subway ====
Through the extension of different subway lines to the intersection with one of the two airport suburban railways, the travel time to the airport from different parts of the north of Munich can be considerably reduced. This was realized for the suburbs of Milbertshofen-Am Hart and Feldmoching-Hasenbergl with the subway line to the station Feldmoching in 1996 and the construction of the airport connector near Neufahrn in 1998. In 2010, the travel time to the airport from Moosach, Schwabing West and Neuhausen-Nymphenburg districts was shortened by connecting the subway line to the station Moosach. The extension of the from Garching to Neufahrn is currently being examined.

==== Erdinger ring connections ====
The Erdinger Ring connection is to extend the S-Bahn (S2) from Erding in the direction of the airport and connect to neighboring Freising through a connecting curve, the Neufahrn Link. It will fulfill the demand of a rail connection between Eastern Bavaria, including the neighboring airport commuter cities Moosburg and Landshut, to the airport, realized with its own regional railway line. A faster connection from the airport to the inner city is not achieved by the Erdinger ring connection, however a direct connection between the airport and the Munich Messe would be. For this, the S2 would also make a short route north of Messe München and have a stop north of the exhibition center.
Already before the opening of the airport there were plans for a regional station at the airport. To this, a railway connection from Mühldorf am Inn is to be made between Erding and Dorfen with the help of the Erdinger ring connection as well as a short new construction single-track called Walpertskirchner Spange. The actual planning phase for this also began, as in the case of the Erdinger ring connection, in August 2006.
On 29 August 2013, the Bavarian Administrative Court rejected the complaints against the plan approval decision of the Neufahrn Link of October 2012 and therefore freed the way for a direct rail connection of the Munich airport from Regensburg, Landshut, Moosburg and Freising. The Neufahrner Kurve is to connect the railway line Landshut-Munich from Neufahr with the railway connection line Neufahr-Flughafen Munich, approximately 2.5 kilometres long, two-track and electrified section of the line. In the construction and financing agreement, signed by rail and free-trade in April 2013, it was agreed that the Neufahrn Link will be built and put into operation by the end of 2018. On 9 December 2018, the new train service to Regensburg and Landshut has commenced.

=== Third runway ===
It has been proposed to build a third runway in the airport. It would likely run in parallel to the existing runways and be located to the north-east of the current north runway, significantly extending the total area occupied by the airport.

==== Justification ====
According to the airport, the growth of air traffic in Munich from 1997 to 2006 was an average of 7% per year, and the airport&#x27;s capacity was already exhausted. Since new airlines in Munich no longer received the desired slots, a traffic-spoiling effect occurred. An air traffic forecast of Intraplan Consult GmbH estimated 58.2 million passengers for 2025, provided the airport has a tight-fitting growth. According to &quot;Flughafen München GmbH&quot; (&quot;FMG&quot;), the airport&#x27;s operator, the current two-runway system is already operating at full capacity during peak hours, and requests for additional slots from airlines have been denied. Further increase in air traffic is expected as Munich is to become a second major hub in Germany after Frankfurt.

In order to cope with the potential traffic in Munich, the operator plans to expand today&#x27;s capacity from 90 movements per hour to 120 movements per hour by constructing a third runway. The shareholders of Flughafen München GmbH (FMG) stated that the construction of a third runway was necessary for the Munich region and for Bavaria as a whole, for reasons of transport and economic policy. Various associations and institutions from economics and politics reacted in favor of the plan approval decision issued by the government of Oberbayern for the construction of a third runway at Munich Airport.

==== Counterarguments ====
The project for the construction of a third runway is particularly contentious in the directly affected airport region of the districts of Freising and Erding, but also in other nearby counties. Above all, they question the growth projections presented by FMG, and one district calls for the use of larger aircraft in order to meet demand.

The opponents of the expansion project joined forces to form the action alliance &quot;aufgeMUCkt&quot; (over 80 groups, including citizens&#x27; initiatives, ecclesiastical groups and environmental organizations), supported by, among others, the BUND in Bavaria, that organized many demonstrations. The Catholic Church, which is the owner of some of the affected sites, also announced resistance to the construction. Since the plan approval decision of 26 July 2011, more protests have taken place. On 29 October 2011, a large demonstration with around 7,000 participants took place in Munich in Marienplatz directly in front of the Old Town Hall.

==== Progress ====
In August 2007, the airport operator applied for planning permission from the government of Upper Bavaria. More than 60,000 objections have been filed during public display of the plans. The objections and lawsuits against the third runway were later overturned by the Bavarian Administrative Court, allowing for construction plans to proceed.

On 26 July 2011, the government of Upper Bavaria issued the zoning approval for the construction of a third runway. With this decision, the zoning authority, after the intensive examination and consideration of all ramifications, expressly approved the need presented by Flughafen München GmbH and the plans submitted for the third runway. Also tied to the approval by the government of Upper Bavaria is the prompt completion of the construction project. However, the airport operator has chosen to follow the advice of Bavaria&#x27;s Higher Administrative Court and not to proceed until the principal proceedings concerning the project have reached a conclusion. The decision is currently being reviewed by the court. The building permit associated with the zoning will continue to be valid for up to 15 years.

While according to ICAO Regulations (Annex XIV) the new runway would have to be named 08L/26R (renaming the existing north runway to 08C/26C), it is currently assigned the working title 09/27 in all plans.

In 2015, the airport received approval from Germany&#x27;s Federal Administrative Court to build a third runway, dismissing all complaints and appeals, and confirming the 2014 decision of Bavaria&#x27;s Higher Administrative Court to grant approval. The plans include a new runway northeast of the existing airport and a new satellite building at Terminal 2, the latter of which did open in April 2016. However, construction of the new runway may yet be delayed as the project has to have unanimous approval by the airport&#x27;s three shareholders: Bavaria, Federal Republic of Germany and the City of Munich. The latter has opposed the plan since a 2012 referendum.

In September 2020, the Bavarian government stopped all progression regarding the third runway until at least 2028 due to the massive decrease of traffic in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>A flying boat is a type of seaplane with a hull, allowing it to land on water. It differs from a floatplane in having a fuselage that is purpose-designed for flotation, while floatplanes rely on fuselage-mounted floats for buoyancy.

Though a flying boat’s fuselage provides buoyancy, it may also utilize under-wing floats or wing-like hull projections (called sponsons) for additional stability. 

Ascending into common use during the First World War, flying boats rapidly grew in both scale and capability during the interwar period, during which time numerous operators found commercial success with the type. Flying boats were some of the largest aircraft of the first half of the 20th century, exceeded in size only by bombers developed during the Second World War. Their advantage lay in using water instead of expensive land-based runways, making them the basis for international airlines in the interwar period. They were also commonly used as maritime patrol aircraft and air-sea rescue, particularly during times of conflict. Flying boats such as the PBY Catalina and Short Sunderland played key roles in both the Pacific Theater and the Atlantic of the Second World War.

The popularity of flying boats gradually tailed off during the Cold War era, partially because of the difficulty in maintaining operations in inclement weather when sea conditions may easily prevent takeoffs and landings while land based aircraft are unaffected, and investments in airports during the conflict that eased the introduction of larger, and more efficient, land-based airliners. Despite being largely overshadowed, limited use of the type continued with some operators, such as in the case of the Shin Meiwa US-1A and the Martin JRM Mars. In the 21st century, flying boats maintain a few niche uses, such as dropping water on forest fires, air transport around archipelagos, and access to undeveloped areas. Many modern seaplane variants, whether float or flying boat types, are convertible amphibious aircraft where either landing gear or flotation modes may be used to land and take off.

==History==

===Early floatplanes===

The quest for an aircraft that could take off or land from water began with float planes, which are not flying boats.

The Frenchman Alphonse Pénaud filed the first patent for a flying machine with a boat hull and retractable landing gear in 1876 but failed to build one. Austrian Wilhelm Kress is credited by some with attempting to build the first successful seaplane &quot;Drachenflieger&quot;, a floatplane, in 1898, although its two 30 hp Daimler engines were inadequate for take-off and it later sank when one of its two floats collapsed.

On 6 June 1905, Gabriel Voisin took off and landed on the River Seine with a towed kite glider on floats. The first of his unpowered flights was . He later built a powered floatplane in partnership with Louis Blériot, but the machine was unsuccessful.

Other pioneers also attempted to attach floats to aircraft in Britain, Australia, France and the USA.

On 28 March 1910, Frenchman Henri Fabre flew the first successful powered floatplane, the Gnome Omega–powered &quot;Hydravion&quot;, a trimaran floatplane. Fabre&#x27;s first successful take off and landing by a powered floatplane inspired other aviators and he designed floats for several other flyers. The first hydro-aeroplane competition was held in Monaco in March 1912, featuring aircraft using floats from Fabre, Curtiss, Tellier and Farman. This led to the first scheduled seaplane passenger services at Aix-les-Bains, using a five-seat Sanchez-Besa from 1 August 1912. The French Navy ordered its first floatplane in 1912.

None of these crafts to date were flying boats.

In 1911–12, François Denhaut constructed the first flying boat, with a fuselage forming a hull, using various designs to give hydrodynamic lift at take-off. Its first successful flight was on 13 April 1912. 

Throughout 1910 and 1911 American pioneering aviator Glenn Curtiss developed his floatplane into the successful Curtiss Model D land-plane, which used a larger central float and sponsons. Combining floats with wheels, he made the first amphibian flights in February 1911 and was awarded the first Collier Trophy for US flight achievement. From 1912 his experiments resulted in the 1913 Model E and Model F, which he called &quot;flying-boats&quot;.

In February 1911, the United States Navy took delivery of the Curtiss Model E, and soon tested landings on and take-offs from ships using the Curtiss Model D.

In Britain, Captain Edward Wakefield and Oscar Gnosspelius began to explore the feasibility of flight from water in 1908. They decided to make use of Windermere in the Lake District, England&#x27;s largest lake to test their floatplane. The latter&#x27;s first attempts to fly attracted large crowds, though the aircraft failed to take off and required a re-design of the floats incorporating features of Borwick&#x27;s successful speed-boat hulls. Meanwhile, Wakefield ordered a floatplane similar to the design of the 1910 Fabre Hydravion. By November 1911, both Gnosspelius and Wakefield had aircraft capable of flight from water and awaited suitable weather conditions. Gnosspelius&#x27;s flight was short-lived as the aircraft crashed into the lake. Wakefield&#x27;s pilot however, taking advantage of a light northerly wind, successfully took off and flew at a height of 50 feet to Ferry Nab, where he made a wide turn and returned for a perfect landing on the lake&#x27;s surface.

===Birth of an industry===

In 1913, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper put up a £10,000 prize for the first non-stop aerial crossing of the Atlantic which was soon &quot;enhanced by a further sum&quot; from the Women&#x27;s Aerial League of Great Britain. American businessman Rodman Wanamaker became determined that the prize should go to an American aircraft and commissioned the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company to design and build an aircraft capable of making the flight. Curtiss&#x27; development of the &quot;Flying Fish&quot; flying boat in 1913 brought him into contact with John Cyril Porte, a retired Royal Navy lieutenant, aircraft designer and test pilot who was to become an influential British aviation pioneer. Recognising that many of the early accidents were attributable to a poor understanding of handling while in contact with the water, the pair&#x27;s efforts went into developing practical hull designs to make the transatlantic crossing possible.

At the same time the British boat building firm J. Samuel White of Cowes on the Isle of Wight set up a new aircraft division and produced a flying boat in the United Kingdom. This was displayed at the London Air Show at Olympia in 1913. In that same year, a collaboration between the S. E. Saunders boatyard of East Cowes and the Sopwith Aviation Company produced the &quot;Bat Boat&quot;, an aircraft with a consuta laminated hull that could operate from land or on water, which today we call an amphibious aircraft. The &quot;Bat Boat&quot; completed several landings on sea and on land and was duly awarded the Mortimer Singer Prize. It was the first all-British aeroplane capable of making six return flights over five miles within five hours.

In the U.S. Wanamaker&#x27;s commission built on Glen Curtiss&#x27; previous development and experience with the Model F for the U.S. Navy which rapidly resulted in the &quot;America&quot;, designed under Porte&#x27;s supervision following his study and rearrangement of the flight plan; the aircraft was a conventional biplane design with two-bay, unstaggered wings of unequal span with two pusher inline engines mounted side-by-side above the fuselage in the interplane gap. Wingtip pontoons were attached directly below the lower wings near their tips. The design (later developed into the Model H), resembled Curtiss&#x27; earlier flying boats, but was built considerably larger so it could carry enough fuel to cover . The three crew members were accommodated in a fully enclosed cabin.

Trials of the &quot;America&quot; began on 23 June 1914 with Porte also as Chief Test Pilot; testing soon revealed serious shortcomings in the design; it was under-powered, so the engines were replaced with more powerful engines mounted in a tractor configuration. There was also a tendency for the nose of the aircraft to try to submerge as engine power increased while taxiing on water. This phenomenon had not been encountered before, since Curtiss&#x27; earlier designs had not used such powerful engines nor large fuel/cargo loads and so were relatively more buoyant. In order to counteract this effect, Curtiss fitted fins to the sides of the bow to add hydrodynamic lift, but soon replaced these with sponsons, a type of underwater pontoon mounted in pairs on either side of a hull. These sponsons (or their engineering equivalents) and the flared, notched hull would remain a prominent feature of flying boat hull design in the decades to follow. With the problem resolved, preparations for the crossing resumed. While the craft was found to handle &quot;heavily&quot; on takeoff, and required rather longer take-off distances than expected, the full moon on 5 August 1914 was selected for the trans-Atlantic flight; Porte was to pilot the &quot;America&quot; with George Hallett as co-pilot and mechanic.

===First World War===
Curtiss and Porte&#x27;s plans were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. Porte sailed for England on 4 August 1914 and rejoined the Navy, as a member of the Royal Naval Air Service. Appointed Squadron Commander of Royal Navy Air Station Hendon, he soon convinced the Admiralty of the potential of flying boats and was put in charge of the naval air station at Felixstowe in 1915. Porte persuaded the Admiralty to commandeer (and later, purchase) the &quot;America&quot; and a sister craft from Curtiss. This was followed by an order for 12 more similar aircraft, one Model H-2 and the remaining as Model H-4&#x27;s. Four examples of the latter were assembled in the UK by Saunders. All of these were similar to the design of the &quot;America&quot; and, indeed, were all referred to as &quot;America&quot;s in Royal Navy service. The engines, however, were changed from the under-powered 160 hp Curtiss engines to 250 hp Rolls-Royce Falcon engines. The initial batch was followed by an order for 50 more (totalling 64 &quot;Americas&quot; overall during the war). Porte also acquired permission to modify and experiment with the Curtiss aircraft.

The Curtiss H-4s were soon found to have a number of problems; they were underpowered, their hulls were too weak for sustained operations and they had poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off. One flying boat pilot, Major Theodore Douglas Hallam, wrote that they were &quot;comic machines, weighing well under two tons; with two comic engines giving, when they functioned, 180 horsepower; and comic control, being nose heavy with engines on and tail heavy in a glide.&quot;
At Felixstowe, Porte made advances in flying boat design and developed a practical hull design with the distinctive &quot;Felixstowe notch&quot;. Porte&#x27;s first design to be implemented in Felixstowe was the Felixstowe Porte Baby, a large, three-engined biplane flying-boat, powered by one central pusher and two outboard tractor Rolls-Royce Eagle engines.

Porte modified an H-4 with a new hull whose improved hydrodynamic qualities made taxiing, take-off and landing much more practical, and called it the Felixstowe F.1.

Porte&#x27;s innovation of the &quot;Felixstowe notch&quot; enabled the craft to overcome suction from the water more quickly and break free for flight much more easily. This made operating the craft far safer and more reliable, although similar devices had been in use in France since 1911. The &quot;notch&quot; breakthrough would soon after evolve into a &quot;step&quot;, with the rear section of the lower hull sharply recessed above the forward lower hull section, and that characteristic became a feature of both flying boat hulls and floatplane floats. The resulting aircraft would be large enough to carry sufficient fuel to fly long distances and could berth alongside ships to take on more fuel.

Porte then designed a similar hull for the larger Curtiss H-12 flying boat which, while larger and more capable than the H-4s, shared failings of a weak hull and poor water handling. The combination of the new Porte-designed hull, this time fitted with two steps, with the wings of the H-12 and a new tail, and powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines, was named the Felixstowe F.2 and first flew in July 1916, proving greatly superior to the Curtiss on which it was based. It was used as the basis for all future designs. It entered production as the Felixstowe F.2A, being used as a patrol aircraft, with about 100 being completed by the end of World War I. Another seventy were built, and these were followed by two F.2c, which were built at Felixstowe.
The Felixstowe F.5 was intended to combine the good qualities of the F.2 and F.3, with the prototype first flying in May 1918. The prototype showed superior qualities to its predecessors but, to ease production, the production version was modified to make extensive use of components from the F.3, which resulted in lower performance than the F.2A or F.3.

The Felixstowe flying boats were extensively employed by the Royal Navy for coastal patrols, including searching for German U-boats. In 1918 they were towed on lighters towards the northern German ports to extend their range; on 4 June 1918 this resulted in three F.2As engaging with ten German seaplanes, shooting down two confirmed and four probables at no loss. As a result of this action, British flying boats were dazzle-painted to aid identification in combat.
The Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company independently developed its designs into the small Model &quot;F&quot;, the larger Model &quot;K&quot; (several of which were sold to the Russian Naval Air Service), and the Model &quot;C&quot; for the U.S. Navy. Curtiss among others also built the Felixstowe F.5 as the Curtiss F5L, based on the final Porte hull designs and powered by American Liberty engines.

Meanwhile, the pioneering flying boat designs of François Denhaut had been steadily developed by the Franco-British Aviation Company into a range of practical craft. Smaller than the Felixstowes, several thousand FBAs served with almost all of the Allied forces as reconnaissance craft, patrolling the North Sea, Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans.

In Italy, several flying boats were developed, starting with the L series, and progressing with the M series. The Macchi M.5 in particular was extremely manoeuvrable and agile and matched the land-based aircraft it had to fight. 244 were built in total. Towards the end of the First World War, the aircraft were flown by the Italian Navy Aviation, the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps airmen. Ensign Charles Hammann won the first Medal of Honor awarded to a United States naval aviator in an M.5.

The Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company modified the Felixstowe F.5 into Aeromarine 75 airliner flying boats which with Aeromarine West Indies Airways flew Air Mail to Florida, Bahamas, and Cuba along with being passenger carriers.

The German aircraft manufacturing company Hansa-Brandenburg built flying boats starting with the model Hansa-Brandenburg GW in 1916. The Austro-Hungarian firm, Lohner-Werke began building flying boats, starting with the Lohner E in 1914 and the later (1915) Lohner L which was copied widely.

=== Interwar period ===
In September 1919, British company Supermarine started operating the first flying boat service in the world, from Woolston to Le Havre in France, but it was short-lived.

A Curtiss NC-4 became the first aircraft to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1919, crossing via the Azores. Of the four that made the attempt, only one completed the flight. Before the development of highly reliable aircraft, the ability to land on water was a desirable safety feature for transoceanic travel.

In 1923, the first successful commercial flying boat service was introduced with flights to and from the Channel Islands. The British aviation industry was experiencing rapid growth. The Government decided that nationalization was necessary and ordered five aviation companies to merge to form the state-owned Imperial Airways of London (IAL). IAL became the international flag-carrying British airline, providing flying boat passenger and mail transport links between Britain and South Africa using aircraft such as the Short S.8 Calcutta.

During the 1920s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) Far East flight performed a series of &quot;showing the flag&quot; long-distance formation flights using the newly developed Supermarine Southampton. Perhaps the most notable of these flights was a expedition conducted during 1927 and 1928; it was carried out by four Southamptons of the Far East Flight, setting out from Felixstowe via the Mediterranean and India to Singapore. Both the RAF and Supermarine acquired considerable acclaim from these flights, as well as proving that flying boats had evolved to become reliable means of long-distance transport.

In the 1930s, flying boats made it possible to have regular air transport between the U.S. and Europe, opening up new air travel routes to South America, Africa, and Asia. Foynes, Ireland and Botwood, Newfoundland and Labrador were the termini for many early transatlantic flights. In areas where there were no airfields for land-based aircraft, flying boats could stop at small island, river, lake or coastal stations to refuel and resupply. The Pan Am Boeing 314 Clipper planes brought exotic destinations like the Far East within reach of air travelers and came to represent the romance of flight.

By 1931, mail from Australia was reaching Britain in just 16 days – less than half the time taken by sea. In that year, government tenders on both sides of the world invited applications to run new passenger and mail services between the ends of the British Empire, and Qantas and IAL were successful with a joint bid. A company under combined ownership was then formed, Qantas Empire Airways. The new ten-day service between Rose Bay, New South Wales (near Sydney), and Southampton was such a success with letter-writers that before long the volume of mail was exceeding aircraft storage space.

A better solution to the problem was sought by the British government during the early 1930s, who released a specification calling for a new large aircraft capable of carrying up to 24 passengers in spacious comfort along with adequate room for airmail or freight while simultaneously being capable of a cruising speed of 170 mph and a range of at least 700 miles; the capacity for an extended range of 2,000 miles to serve the North Atlantic route was also stipulated. Originally intended for use by IAL, partner Qantas agreed to the initiative and undertook to purchase six of the new Short S23 &quot;C&quot; class or &quot;Empire&quot; flying boats as well. Being ordered from aviation manufacturer Short Brothers, the Empire was reportedly hailed as being &quot;one of the world&#x27;s boldest experiments in aviation&quot;, while early sceptics referred to the order less favourably as being a &#x27;gamble&#x27;. IAL were so impressed by the Empire that it placed a follow-on order for another 11; when combined with the original order for 28 flying boats, this was the largest single order to have ever been placed for a British civil aircraft at that time.

Delivering the mail as quickly as possible generated a lot of competition and some innovative designs. One variant of the Short Empire flying boats was the strange-looking &quot;Maia and Mercury&quot;. It was a four-engined floatplane &quot;Mercury&quot; (the winged messenger) fixed on top of &quot;Maia&quot;, a heavily modified Short Empire flying boat. The larger Maia took off, carrying the smaller Mercury loaded to a weight greater than it could take off with. This allowed the Mercury to carry sufficient fuel for a direct trans-Atlantic flight with the mail. Unfortunately this was of limited usefulness, and the Mercury had to be returned from America by ship. The Mercury did set a number of distance records before in-flight refuelling was adopted.

Sir Alan Cobham devised a method of in-flight refuelling in the 1930s. In the air, the Short Empire could be loaded with more fuel than it could take off with. Short Empire flying boats serving the trans-Atlantic crossing were refueled over Foynes; with the extra fuel load, they could make a direct trans-Atlantic flight. A Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow was used as the fuel tanker.

The German Dornier Do X flying boat was noticeably different from its UK and U.S.-built counterparts. It had wing-like protrusions from the fuselage, called sponsons, to stabilize it on the water without the need for wing-mounted outboard floats. This feature was pioneered by Claudius Dornier during the First World War on his Dornier Rs. I giant flying boat, and perfected on the Dornier Wal in 1924. The enormous Do X was powered by 12 engines and once carried 170 persons as a publicity stunt. It flew to America in 1930–31, crossing the Atlantic via an indirect route over 9 months. It was the largest flying boat of its time, but was severely underpowered and was limited by a very low operational ceiling. Only three were built, with a variety of different engines installed, in an attempt to overcome the lack of power. Two of these were sold to Italy.

The Dornier Wal was &quot;easily the greatest commercial success in the history of marine aviation&quot;. Over 250 were built in Italy, Spain, Japan, The Netherlands and Germany. Numerous airlines operated the Dornier Wal on scheduled passenger and mail services. Wals were used by explorers, for a number of pioneering flights, and by the military in many countries. Though having first flown in 1922, from 1934 to 1938 Wals operated the over-water sectors of the Deutsche Luft Hansa South Atlantic Airmail service.

===Second World War===

The military value of flying boats was well recognized, and every country bordering on water operated them in a military capacity at the outbreak of the Second World War. Flying boats such as the PBM Mariner patrol bomber, PBY Catalina, Short Sunderland, and Grumman Goose were procured in large numbers. The Sunderland, which was developed in parallel to the civilian Empire flying boat, was one of the most powerful and widely used flying boats throughout the conflict, while Catalinas were one of the most produced ASW of the war, with over 2,661 being produced in the US alone.

Flying boats were commonly utilized to conduct various tasks, from anti-submarine patrol to air-sea rescue and gunfire spotting for battleships. They would recover downed airmen and operate as scout aircraft over the vast distances of the Pacific Theater and the Atlantic, locating enemy vessels and sinking numerous submarines. In May 1941, the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; was discovered by a PBY Catalina flying out of Castle Archdale Flying boat base, Lower Lough Erne, Northern Ireland. A flight of Catalinas spotted the Japanese fleet approaching Midway Island, beginning the Battle of Midway.

On 3 April 1940, a single Sunderland operating off Norway was attacked by six German Junkers Ju 88C fighters; during the engagement, it shot one down and damaged another until it retreated and drove off the rest. The Germans reputedly nicknamed the Sunderland the &quot;Fliegendes Stachelschwein&quot; (&quot;Flying Porcupine&quot;) due to its defensive firepower. Sunderlands in the Mediterranean theatre proved themselves on multiple high-profile occasions, flying many evacuation missions during the German seizure of Crete, each carrying as many as 82 passengers. One Sunderland flew the reconnaissance mission to observe the Italian fleet at anchor in Taranto before the famous Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s torpedo attack on 11 November 1940.
The largest flying boat of the war was the Blohm &amp; Voss BV 238, which was also the heaviest plane to fly during the Second World War and the largest aircraft built and flown by any of the Axis Powers. Only the first prototype ever flew, commencing flight trials in April 1944. Months later, it was strafed and partially sunk while moored on Lake Schaal, to the east of Hamburg; it never returned to flight, instead being intentionally sunk in deep water after the end of the conflict.
The Imperial Japanese Navy operated what has been often described as the best flying boat of the conflict, the Kawanishi H8K. Its design was based upon its immediate predecessor, the Kawanishi H6K, but was a considerably larger and longer-ranged aircraft designed at the request of the Navy just prior to the outbreak of war. On the night of 4 March 1942, two H8Ks conducted the second raid on Pearl Harbor, refuelling en route by submarine at French Frigate Shoals in order to achieve the necessary range; poor visibility caused this attack on Pearl Harbor to fail to accomplish any significant damage. An improved H8K2 variant of the type, featuring extremely heavy defensive armament, was also introduced.

In November 1939, IAL was restructured into three separate companies: British European Airways, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), and British South American Airways (which merged with BOAC in 1949), with the change being made official on 1 April 1940. BOAC continued to operate flying boat services from the (slightly) safer confines of Poole Harbour during wartime, returning to Southampton in 1947. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, the Mediterranean was closed to allied planes, and BOAC and Qantas operated the Horseshoe Route between Durban and Sydney using Short Empire flying boats.

The Martin Company produced the prototype XPB2M Mars based on their PBM Mariner patrol bomber, with flight tests between 1941 and 1943. The Mars was converted by the Navy into a transport aircraft designated the XPB2M-1R. Satisfied with the performance, 20 of the modified JRM-1 Mars were ordered. The first of the five production Mars flying boats entered service ferrying cargo to Hawaii and the Pacific Islands on 23 January 1944. Following the end of the conflict, the Navy opted to scaled back their order, buying only the five aircraft. The five Mars were completed, and the last delivered in 1947.

The U.S. used several 4-engine flying boats during World War II, including those that had been operating as civilian airliners. This included five Boeing B-314 Clippers, four more as the C-98s; two Martin M-130 Clippers,a Martin XPB2M-1/XPB2M-1R prototype, and one JRM-1 Mars; three Sikorsky VS-44s (JR2S-1). However, the main 4-engined flying boat of the U.S. forces was the PB2Y Coronado, of which nearly 220 were used in several versions:maritime patrol, bombing, medical/hospital transport, and for regular cargo; it also served with British forces in the Battle for the Atlantic.

One of the features of flying boats that was useful for search and rescue, was the ability to land on the water and not only pull out people from the water but stay there. One of the famous cases of this was the sinking of the , which went down on 31 July 1945, leaving hundreds of sailors in the water. Once it was realized it was missing, it was searched for, and the first to arrive was an amphibious PBY-5A Catalina patrol plane flown by Lieutenant Commander (USN) Robert Adrian Marks. Marks and his flight crew spotted the survivors and dropped life rafts; one raft was destroyed by the drop, while others were too far away from the exhausted crew. Against standing orders not to land in the open ocean, given the unique situation and lives at risk, Marks took a vote of his crew and decided to land the aircraft in swells. He was able to maneuver his craft to pick up 56 survivors. Space in the plane was limited, so Marks had men lashed to the wing with parachute cord. The aircraft was unflyable with so many on it but could still float. This protected many of the exhausted men from being eaten by sharks or drowning while waiting for the main rescue force to arrive. After nightfall, the destroyer escort , the first of seven rescue ships, used its searchlight as a beacon and instilled hope in those still in the water. &quot;Cecil J. Doyle&quot; and six other ships picked up the remaining survivors. After the rescue, the PBY was sunk by &quot;Cecil J. Doyle&quot; to scuttle it.

===Post-War===

After the end of the Second World War, the use of flying boats rapidly declined for several reasons. The ability to land on water became less of an advantage owing to the considerable increase in the number and length of land based runways during the conflict. Furthermore the commercial competitiveness of flying boats diminished, as their design compromised aerodynamic efficiency and speed in order to accommodate waterborne takeoff and landing. New land-based airliners such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-4 were developed with comparable reliability, speed, and long-range. The new landplanes were relatively easy to fly, and did not require the extensive pilot training programs mandated for seaplane operations. One of the 314&#x27;s most experienced pilots said, &quot;We were indeed glad to change to DC-4s, and I argued daily for eliminating all flying boats. The landplanes were much safer. No one in the operations department ... had any idea of the hazards of flying boat operations. The main problem now was lack of the very high level of experience and competence required of seaplane pilots&quot;.

The Hughes H-4 Hercules, in development in the U.S. during the war, was even larger than the BV 238 but it did not fly until 1947. The &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, as the 180-ton H-4 was nicknamed, was the largest flying boat ever to fly. Carried out during Senate hearings into Hughes&#x27; use of government funds on its construction, the short hop of about a mile at 70 ft above the water by the &quot;Flying Lumberyard&quot; was claimed by Hughes as the H-4&#x27;s vindication. Cutbacks in expenditure after the war and the disappearance of its intended mission as a transatlantic transport left the H-4 with no purpose. Despite never flying again, a full-time crew of 300 workers maintained the H-4 in a flightworthy condition in a climate-controlled hangar up until Hughes&#x27; death in 1976.

In early 1944, the British Air Ministry issued a contract for the production of a small jet-powered flying boat, the Saunders-Roe SR.A/1, that was intended for use as an air defence aircraft optimised for use in the Pacific theatre. By adopting jet propulsion for the flying boat, it was possible to design it with a hull, rather than making it a floatplane, and thus eliminating the performance handicaps typically imposed upon floatplanes. It was projected to be capable of attaining speeds of up to 520 mph at 40,000 ft. Due to the SR.A/1&#x27;s perceived value in the war against Imperial Japan, measures taken at an early stage of development towards immediate quantity production. However, due to the end of the conflict, pressure for the SR.A/1 quickly dissipated.

On 16 July 1947, the SR.A/1 prototype performed its maiden flight, quickly proving its soundness in terms of its performance and handling. However, officials judged that such an aircraft was unnecessary, and that the aircraft carrier had demonstrated a far more effective way to project airpower over the oceans. During late 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, interest in the SR.A/1 programme was briefly resurrected amongst British and American officials, with whom data had been shared in the project. However, the flying boat fighter was found to be obsolete in comparison to increasingly capable land-based fighters, leading to a second and final cancellation.

During the Berlin Airlift (which lasted from June 1948 until August 1949) ten Sunderlands and two Hythes were used to transport goods from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to isolated Berlin, landing on the Havelsee beside RAF Gatow until it iced over. The Sunderlands were particularly used for transporting salt, as their airframes were already protected against corrosion from seawater. Transporting salt in standard aircraft risked rapid and severe structural corrosion in the event of a spillage. In addition, three Aquila Airways flying boats were used during the airlift.

Bucking the trend, in 1948 Aquila Airways was founded to serve destinations that were still inaccessible to land-based aircraft. This company operated Short S.25 and Short S.45 flying boats out of Southampton on routes to Madeira, Las Palmas, Lisbon, Jersey, Mallorca, Marseille, Capri, Genoa, Montreux and Santa Margherita. From 1950 to 1957, Aquila also operated a service from Southampton to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The flying boats of Aquila Airways were also chartered for one-off trips, usually to deploy troops where scheduled services did not exist or where there were political considerations. The longest charter, in 1952, was from Southampton to the Falkland Islands. In 1953, the flying boats were chartered for troop deployment trips to Freetown and Lagos and there was a special trip from Kingston upon Hull to Helsinki to relocate a ship&#x27;s crew. The airline ceased operations on 30 September 1958.
On 22 August 1952, the Saunders-Roe Princess, one of the largest and luxurious flying boats ever developed, performed its maiden flight. While flight testing of the innovative and ambitious flying boat went relatively smoothly, determining that the Princess was indeed capable of achieving its envisioned performance figures, only one prototype of the type would ever fly. Despite the granting of a certificate of airworthiness and representing the pinnacle of flying boat development of the era, no customers were willing to place firm orders for the Princess. This is despite reports that several would-be operators, including Aquila Airways and Aero Spacelines, had attempted to purchase examples.

In 1951, BOAC performed an in-depth reevaluation of its standing requirements, and determined that the airline had no present need for the Princess, or any new large flying boat. The airline had already chosen to terminate its existing flying boat services during the previous year. Up until 1974, Ansett Australia operated a flying boat service from Rose Bay to Lord Howe Island using Short Sandringhams.

The US Navy continued to operate flying boats (notably the Martin P5M Marlin) until the late 1960s. During the 1950s, the US Navy had encouraged the development of a jet-powered flying boat bomber, the Martin P6M Seamaster; however, its development was protracted by unfavourable handling characteristics above Mach 0.8, including rapid changes in directional trim, severe buffeting, and wing drop, which made it unfeasible for service until these tendencies were rectified. Following the US Navy&#x27;s withdrawal of support, Martin tried unsuccessfully to market the SeaMaster to the civilian market, rebranding it as the &quot;SeaMistress&quot;, but the initiative picked up no takers.

During the 1950s, the Japanese aircraft manufacturer ShinMeiwa Industries conducted internal design studies into developing flying boats that would exhibit greater levels of seaworthiness than their predecessors. Over the following decade, the company developed the Shin Meiwa US-1A, a new generation flying boat, to meet Japan&#x27;s requirement for a maritime patrol aircraft capable of ASW operations. The initial model, designated &quot;PS-1&quot;, was quickly followed by a dedicated search-and-rescue (SAR) variant, the &quot;US-1&quot;, although this was technically an amphibian rather than a flying boat through its modified designs. Shin Meiwa developed further flying boat concepts around this period, including the &quot;Shin Meiwa MS&quot; (Medium Seaplane) a 300-passenger long-range flying boat with its own beaching gear; and the gargantuan &quot;Shin Meiwa GS&quot; (Giant Seaplane) with a capacity of 1200 passengers seated on three decks.

===Twenty-first century developments===
The shape of the Short Empire, a British flying boat of the 1930s was a harbinger of the shape of 20th century aircraft yet to come. Today, however, true flying boats have largely been replaced by floatplanes or amphibious aircraft with wheels. The Beriev Be-200 twin-jet amphibious aircraft is used for fighting forest fires. There are also several experimental/kit amphibians such as the Volmer Sportsman, Quikkit Glass Goose, Airmax Sea Max, Aeroprakt A-24, and Seawind 300C.

The ShinMaywa US-2 is a large STOL amphibious aircraft designed for air-sea rescue work, derived from the earlier US-1. The first example was delivered to the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force in 2009; the service has replaced its US-1 fleet with the US-2. A civilian-orientated fire-fighting variant of the US-2 has also been designed and promoted to prospective customers.

The Canadair CL-415, an improved model of the Canadair CL-215, remains in production during the twenty-first century. The type has been primarily used for forest fire suppression, but has also seen use in other capacities, such as a maritime patrol aircraft.

The German company Dornier Seawings, an off-shoot of the original Dornier company, has repeatedly announced plans to launch production of its SeaStar composite flying boat. In February 2016, Dornier launched the improved CD2 SeaStar.

During the 2010s, the state-owned company Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) launched a program to develop a massive new amphibian, the AVIC AG600. On 24 December 2017, it made its maiden flight from Zhuhai Jinwan Airport.

The ICON A5 is an amphibious aircraft in the light-sport class.
The Progressive Aerodyne Searey is an amphibious aircraft in the light-sport class, available as a kit built experimental or factory built aircraft. 
Shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union two separated scientific production associations (NPO) in Samara started to make flying boats for a new developing russian general aviation. Today NPO Aerovolga makes its La series with La-8 being its latest while NPO Chaika makes L series with L-65 being its latest in a line-up.

<text>The Gulf of Suez (; formerly , &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sea of Calm&quot;) is a gulf at the northern end of the Red Sea, to the west of the Sinai Peninsula. Situated to the east of the Sinai Peninsula is the smaller Gulf of Aqaba. The gulf was formed within a relatively young but now inactive Gulf of Suez Rift rift basin, dating back about 26 million years. It stretches some north by northwest, terminating at the Egyptian city of Suez and the entrance to the Suez Canal. Along the mid-line of the gulf is the boundary between Africa and Asia. The entrance of the gulf lies atop the mature Gemsa oil and gas field.
The gulf is considered one of the world&#x27;s important maritime zones due to being an entrance to the Suez Canal.

==Geography==
The gulf occupies the northwestern arm of the Red Sea between Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. It is the third arm of the triple junction rift system, the second arm being the Gulf of Aqaba.

===Extent===

The length of the gulf, from its mouth at the Strait of Gubal (alternate name: Strait of Jubal) to its head at the city of Suez, is , and it varies in width from .

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the gulf as &quot;A line running from Ras Muhammed (27°43&#x27;N) to the South point of Shadwan Island (34°02&#x27;E) and thence Westward on a parallel (27°27&#x27;N) to the coast of Africa&quot;.

==Geology==

The Gems Field was discovered in 1869, but did not produce until 1910. The Hurghada Field produced in 1913. By 1998, over 1900 wells had been drilled and 120 fields identified. The major oil source rock is the Upper Cretaceous marine Sudr Formation, the limestone Campanian Brown/Duwi Member in particular, which is thick in the gulf.

The gulf sedimentary basin stratigraphic section consists of prerift Paleozoic to Oligocene clastic rocks and carbonates, and synrift and postrift Miocene to Holocene clastics and evaporites.
Three large oil fields are in the gulf: the El Morgan discovered in 1964, Belayim discovered in 1955, and the October Field discovered in 1977. The October Field produces from the Cretaceous Nubia Formation, the Upper Cretaceous Nezzazat Formation, the Miocene Nukhul Formation, and the Miocene Asl Member of the Upper Rudeis Formation.

<text>Adam of Saint Victor (; – 1146) was a prolific composer and poet of Latin hymns. A central figure of the sequences in high medieval music, he has been called &quot;...the most illustrious exponent of the revival of liturgical poetry which the twelfth century affords.&quot;

Adam&#x27;s career was based in Paris, split between the Abbey of Saint Victor and Notre Dame. He was well acquainted with numerous contemporary scholars and musicians, including the philosopher and composer Peter Abelard, the theologian Hugh of Saint Victor and the composer Albertus Parisiensis, the last possibly being his student.

==Life==
Adam of Saint Victor was born in the late eleventh century; the musicologist Gustave Reese estimated . He was most likely born in Paris, where he was educated. The first reference to him dates from 1098, in the archives of Notre Dame Cathedral, where he held office first as a subdeacon and later as a precentor. He left the cathedral for the Abbey of Saint Victor around 1133, probably because of his attempts at imposing the Rule of St Augustine at the cathedral.

Adam likely had contact with a number of important theologians, poets, and musicians of his day, including Peter Abelard and Hugh of St Victor, and he may have taught Albertus Parisiensis.

He lived in the abbey, which was something of a theological center, until his death

==Music and poetry==
Adam of St Victor&#x27;s surviving works are sequences for liturgical use, not theological treatises.

Jodocus Clichtovaeus, a Catholic theologian of the 16th century, published thirty-seven of his hymns in the &quot;Elucidatorium Ecclesiasticum&quot; (1516). The remaining seventy hymns were preserved in the Abbey of Saint Victor until its dissolution during the French Revolution. They were then transferred to the Bibliothèque Nationale, where they were discovered by Léon Gautier, who edited the first complete edition of them (Paris, 1858).

Around 47 sequences by Adam survive. In a practice that developed from the ninth century onwards, these are poems composed to be sung during the mass, between the Alleluia and the gospel reading. The sequence therefore bridges the Old Testament or epistle readings and the gospel, both litergically and musically.

==Reputation==
According to John Julian, &quot;His principal merits may be described as comprising terseness and felicity of expression; deep and accurate knowledge of Scripture, especially its typology; smoothness of versification; richness of rhyme, accumulating gradually as he nears the conclusion of a Sequence; and a spirit of devotion breathing throughout his work, that assures the reader that his work is &#x27;a labour of love&#x27;&quot;.

Anglican Archbishop Richard Chenevix Trench characterized Adam of Saint Victor as &quot;the foremost among the sacred Latin poets of the Middle Ages&quot;. 

In &quot;Mont Saint Michel and Chartres&quot;, Henry Adams wrote that Adam &quot;aimed at obtaining his effect from the skillful use of the Latin sonorities for purposes of the chant&quot;.

The translator of medieval hymns, John Mason Neale, described Adam of St Victor as &quot;to my mind the greatest Latin poet, not only of mediaeval, but of all ages&quot;.

==Editions==
The modern critical edition of the Latin text is:

English translations of Adam&#x27;s work are in:
* [includes translations of two of Adam of St. Victor&#x27;s sequences in praise of the Trinity]
* [includes translation of Adam of St Victor, &quot;Sequences&quot;] 
* Vol. 1, Vol. 2, Vol. 3

<text>The Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is a major public transport network serving Hong Kong. Operated by the MTR Corporation (MTRCL), it consists of heavy rail, light rail, and feeder bus services, centred around a 10-line rapid transit network, serving the urbanised areas of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. The system encompasses of railways, as of December 2022, with 179 stations—including 99 heavy rail stations, 68 light rail stops and 1 high-speed rail terminus.

Under the government&#x27;s rail-led transport policy, the MTR system is a common mode of public transport in Hong Kong, with over five and a half million trips made on an average weekday consistently achieving a 99.9% punctuality rate on its arrivals and departures. As of 2018, the MTR has a 49.3% share of the franchised public transport market, making it the most popular transport option in Hong Kong. The integration of the Octopus smart card fare-payment technology into the MTR system in September 1997 has further enhanced the ease of commuting.

==History==
=== Initial proposals ===
During the 1960s, the government of Hong Kong saw a need to accommodate increasing road traffic as Hong Kong&#x27;s economy grew rapidly. In 1966, British transport consultants Freeman, Fox, Wilbur Smith &amp; Associates were appointed to study the transport system of Hong Kong. The study was based on the projection of the population of Hong Kong for 1986, estimated at 6,868,000. On 1 September 1967, the consultants submitted the &quot;Hong Kong Mass Transport Study&quot; to the government, which recommended the construction of a rapid transit rail system in Hong Kong. The study suggested that four rail lines be developed in six stages, with a completion date set between December 1973 and December 1984. Detailed locations of lines and stations were presented in the study. These four lines were the Kwun Tong line (from Mong Kok to Ma Yau Tong), Tsuen Wan line (from Admiralty to Tsuen Wan), Island line (from Kennedy to Chai Wan Central), and Shatin line (from Tsim Sha Tsui to Wo Liu Hang).

The study was submitted to the Legislative Council on 14 February 1968. The consultants received new data from the 1966 by-census on 6 March 1968. A short supplementary report was submitted on 22 March 1968 and amended in June 1968. The by-census indicated that the projected 1986 population was reduced by more than one million from the previous estimate to 5,647,000. The dramatic reduction affected town planning. The population distribution was largely different from the original study. The projected 1986 populations of Castle Peak New Town, Sha Tin New Town, and, to a lesser extent, Tsuen Wan New Town, were revised downwards, and the plan for a new town in Tseung Kwan O was shelved. In this updated scenario, the consultants reduced the scale of the recommended system. The supplementary report stated that the originally suggested four tracks between Admiralty station and Mong Kok station should be reduced to two, and only parts of the Island line, Tsuen Wan line, and Kwun Tong line should be constructed for the initial system. The other lines would be placed in the list of extensions. This report led to the final study in 1970.

In 1970, a revised system with four lines was laid out in the British consultants&#x27; new report, &quot;Hong Kong Mass Transit: Further Studies&quot;. The four lines were to be the Kwun Tong line, Tsuen Wan line, Island line, and East Kowloon line. The lines that were eventually constructed were somewhat different compared to those presented in this report and the &quot;Hong Kong Mass Transport Study&quot;.

In 1972, the Hong Kong government authorised construction of the &quot;Initial System&quot;, a system that roughly translates to today&#x27;s Kwun Tong line between Kwun Tong and Prince Edward, Tsuen Wan line between Mei Foo and Admiralty, and Island line between Sheung Wan and Admiralty. The Mass Transit Steering Committee, chaired by the Financial Secretary Philip Haddon-Cave, began negotiations with four major construction consortia in 1973. The government&#x27;s intention was to tender the entire project, based on the British design, as a single tender at a fixed price. A consortium from Japan, led by Mitsubishi, submitted the only proposal within the government&#x27;s $5-billion price ceiling. They signed an agreement to construct the system in early 1974, but in December of the same year, pulled out of the agreement for reasons stemming from fears of the oil crisis.

=== Modified initial system ===
Several weeks later, in early 1975, the Mass Transit Steering Group was replaced by the Mass Transport Provisional Authority, which held more executive powers. It announced that the Initial System would be reduced to and renamed the &quot;Modified Initial System&quot; (now part of the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines). Plans for a single contract were abandoned in favour of 25 engineering contracts and 10 electrical and mechanical contracts. On 7 May 1975 the Legislative Council passed legislation setting up the government-owned Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) to replace the Mass Transport Provisional Authority, the &quot;Mass Transit Railway Ordinance&quot;.

Construction of the system began on 11 November 1975. The northern section was completed on 30 September 1979 and was opened on 1 October 1979 by Governor Murray MacLehose. Trains on this route ran from Shek Kip Mei to Kwun Tong in Phase 1, Tsim Sha Tsui to Kwun Tong in Phase 2 in December 1979, and Chater to Kwun Tong in the last phase, initially in a four-car configuration. The first train drivers were trained on the London Underground. It was designed by a consortium of consultants led by Freeman Fox and Partners. On later extensions to the railway the stations were designed under the supervision of Roland Paoletti, the chief architect at MTR.

The full Modified Initial System was opened on 12 February 1980 by Princess Alexandra, who rode the inaugural train through the immersed tube beneath Victoria Harbour to Central station. Trains were gradually extended to six cars to accommodate an increase in passenger numbers.

=== Line extensions ===

The government approved construction of the Tsuen Wan line in 1977, then known as the Tsuen Wan Extension, and works commenced in November 1978. The project added a section to the MTR system, from Prince Edward station to Tsuen Wan. The line started service on 17 May 1982 with a total cost of construction (not adjusted for inflation) of HK$4.1 billion (US$526 million). The plan was modified from that in the 1970 report &quot;Hong Kong Mass Transit: Further Studies&quot;, with Kwai Chung station, Lap Sap Wan station, and a planned depot in Kwai Chung next to Lap Sap Wan station being replaced by stations in Kwai Hing and Kwai Fong and a depot in Tsuen Wan. Several stations also had names different to that during planning: So Uk station became Cheung Sha Wan, Cheung Sha Wan became Lai Chi Kok, and Lai Chi Kok became Lai Wan (later renamed Mei Foo).

When service of this line started, the section of the Kwun Tong line from Chater to Argyle (since renamed Central and Mong Kok respectively) was transferred to the Tsuen Wan line. Thus, Waterloo station (since renamed Yau Ma Tei) became the terminus of the Kwun Tong line, and both Argyle and Prince Edward stations became interchange stations. This change was made because system planners expected the patronage of the Tsuen Wan line to exceed that of the Kwun Tong line. This forecast proved to be accurate, necessitating a bypass from the northwestern New Territories to Hong Kong Island. The Tung Chung line was therefore launched in 1998 with an interchange station at Lai King for that purpose.

Although land acquisitions were made for a station at Tsuen Wan West (near Tsuen King Circuit), beyond Tsuen Wan station, as part of the Tsuen Wan branch, the station was never built. This is not to be confused with the modern-day Tsuen Wan West station on Tuen Ma line, which lies on a newly reclaimed area near the former ferry pier.

Since opening in 1982, the Tsuen Wan line is the line whose alignment has remained the same for the longest time. For example, the Kwun Tong line&#x27;s alignment has changed three times since its opening—the taking over of Tsuen Wan line from Mong Kok to Central, the taking over of Eastern Harbour Crossing section by the Tseung Kwan O line, and its extension to Whampoa.

Government approvals were granted for construction of the Island line in December 1980. Construction commenced in October 1981. On 31 May 1985, the Island line was opened with service between Admiralty station and Chai Wan station. Both Admiralty and Central stations became interchange stations with the Tsuen Wan line. Furthermore, each train was extended to eight cars. On 23 May 1986, the Island line was extended to Sheung Wan station. Construction was delayed for one year, as government offices which were located over the station had to be moved before the construction could start.

In 1984, the government approved the construction of the Eastern Harbour Crossing, a tunnel to be used by cars and MTR trains. The Kwun Tong line was extended across the harbour on 5 August 1989 to Quarry Bay station, which became an interchange station for the Kwun Tong line and the Island line. An intermediate station, Lam Tin, started operations on 1 October 1989.

=== Airport connection ===
The decision was made in October 1989 to construct a new international airport at Chek Lap Kok on Lantau Island to replace the overcrowded Kai Tak International Airport. The government invited the MTRC to build a train line, then known as the Lantau Airport Railway, to the airport. Construction started in November 1994, after the Chinese and British governments settled their financial and land disagreements.

The new line was included in the financing plans of the new Hong Kong International Airport as the airport was not considered viable without direct public transport links. Construction costs were also shared by the MTRC, which was granted many large-scale developments in the construction plans for the new stations.

The Lantau Airport Railway included two MTR lines, the Tung Chung line and the Airport Express. The Tung Chung line was officially opened on 21 June 1998 by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, and service commenced the next day. The Airport Express opened for service on 6 July 1998 along with the new Hong Kong International Airport.

The Airport Express also offers flight check-in facilities at Kowloon station and Hong Kong station—the in-town check-ins offer a more convenient and time-saving routine; a free shuttle bus service transports travellers from these stations to their respective hotels as well. Porters are also available to help transport luggage from and onto trains. It is the second most popular means of transport to the airport after buses. In 2012, it had a 21.8 per cent of share of the traffic to and from the airport. However, this has declined from a peak of 32 per cent in 1999.

=== Tseung Kwan O line ===

The Quarry Bay Congestion Relief Works extended the Hong Kong Island end of the Kwun Tong line from Quarry Bay to North Point via a pair of tunnels. The project was initiated due to overcrowding at Quarry Bay and persistent passenger complaints about the five-minute walk from the Island line platforms to the Kwun Tong line platform. Construction began in September 1997 and was completed in September 2001 at a cost of HK$3.1 billion. As with most earlier interchange stations, a cross-platform interchange arrangement was provided here in both directions.

Construction of the Tseung Kwan O line (called the Tseung Kwan O extension line in the planning stage) was approved on 18 August 1998 to serve the growing Tseung Kwan O New Town. Construction began on 24 April 1999 and the line officially opened in 2002. It took over the existing Kwun Tong line tracks running through the Eastern Harbour Tunnel, so that the full line stretches from Po Lam to North Point. When the line opened, the Kwun Tong line was extended to Tiu Keng Leng on the new line. Construction costs were partly covered by the Hong Kong Government and private developers which linked construction of the Tseung Kwan O line to new real estate and commercial developments.

=== Interchange stations ===
The interchange between the Kwun Tong line and the Tsuen Wan line (except Yau Ma Tei) as well as that between the Kwun Tong line and the Tseung Kwan O line, are two stations long, allowing cross-platform interchange wherein a passenger leaves a train on one side of the platform and boards trains on the other side of the platform for another line. For example, when passengers are travelling on the Kwun Tong line towards Tiu Keng Leng, getting off at Yau Tong would allow them to switch trains across the platform for the Tseung Kwan O line towards North Point. Whereas, staying on the train and reaching Tiu Keng Leng would allow them to board the Tseung Kwan O line trains towards Po Lam/LOHAS Park. This design makes interchanging more convenient and passengers do not have the need to change to different levels. However this interchange arrangement is not available for all transferring passengers at Kowloon Tong, Central, Hong Kong, Quarry Bay, Nam Cheong (except transfer between Tuen Mun and Hong Kong bound trains), Mei Foo, Tai Wai (only between southbound Tuen Ma line and East Rail line trains) and Sunny Bay (except transfer between Tung Chung and Disneyland Resort bound trains) stations, mainly because this service is available only when there are two continuous stations shared as interchange stations by two lines.

Two major works were undertaken to ease interchange between the Kwun Tong line and East Rail line. The modification of Kowloon Tong station started in June 2001. A new pedestrian link to Kowloon Tong station southern concourse and a new entrance (Exit D) opened on 15 April 2004 to cope with the increase in interchange passenger flow. Modification to Tsim Sha Tsui station involved upgrading station facilities and concourse layout to facilitate access from the East Tsim Sha Tsui station via its pedestrian links. New entrances to the subway links were opened on 19 September 2004 (Exit G) and 30 March 2005 (Exit F), with the whole scheme completed in May 2005.

=== Disneyland Resort line ===

The Disneyland Resort line, previously known as Penny&#x27;s Bay Rail Link, provides service to the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort station which was opened on 12 September 2005. Services to Sunny Bay station on the Tung Chung line started in 1 June 2005, but it was only opened to staff of Disneyland at first. It was finally opened to the general public two months later, on 8 August 2005. The new line and the Disneyland Resort station opened on 1 August 2005. It is a single-track railway that runs between Sunny Bay station and Disneyland Resort station. The Disneyland Resort station itself was designed to blend in with the ambiance of the resort. The line operates fully automated trains running every four to ten minutes without a driver. The carriages are refurbished M-train rolling stock to match the recreational and adventurous nature of the 3.5-minute journey.

=== Airport Express extension ===

The AsiaWorld–Expo station is an extension of the Airport Express serving a new international exhibition centre, AsiaWorld–Expo, at Hong Kong International Airport. The station opened on 20 December 2005 along with the exhibition centre. To cope with the projected increase in patronage, Airport Express trains were lengthened to eight cars from the previous seven. Additional trains are also deployed on the Tung Chung line during major exhibitions and events.

=== Partial privatisation and merger ===
On 5 October 2000 the operator of the MTR network, the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC), became Hong Kong&#x27;s first rail company to be partially privatised, marking the beginning of the Hong Kong government&#x27;s initiative to reduce its interests in public utilities. Prior to its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) was wholly owned by the Hong Kong government. The offering involved the sale of about one billion shares, and the company now has the largest shareholder base of any company listed in Hong Kong. In June 2001, MTRCL was transferred to the Hang Seng Index.

MTRCL has often developed properties next to stations to complement its profitable railway business. Many recently built stations were incorporated into large housing estates or shopping complexes. For example, Tsing Yi station is built next to the Maritime Square shopping centre and directly underneath the Tierra Verde housing estate.

On 11 April 2006, MTRCL signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the Hong Kong government, the owner of Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation, to merge the operation of the two railway networks in Hong Kong in spite of the strong opposition of KCRC staff. The minority shareholders of the corporation approved the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on 9 October 2007, allowing MTRCL to take over the operation of the KCR network and combine the fare system of the two networks on 2 December 2007.

On 2 December 2007 the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) granted a 50-year service concession (which may be extended) of the KCR network to MTRCL, in return for making annual payments to KCRC, thereby merging the railway operations of the two corporations under MTRCL&#x27;s management. At the same time MTRCL changed its Chinese name from &quot;地下鐵路有限公司&quot; (Subway Limited Company) to &quot;香港鐵路有限公司&quot; (Hong Kong Railway Limited Company), but left its English name unchanged; at the same time the system&#x27;s Chinese name changed from &quot;地鐵&quot; (&quot;underground railway&quot;) to &quot;港鐵&quot; (&quot;Hong Kong Railway&quot;). After the merger, the MTR network included three more lines—East Rail line, West Rail line, and Ma On Shan line (now the Tuen Ma line)—as well as the light rail network and Guangdong through train to Guangzhou.

On 28 September 2008, fare zones of all urban lines, East Rail line, Ma On Shan line, and West Rail line were merged. A passenger could travel on these networks with only one ticket, except where a transfer is made between Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui stations, where two tickets are required. Student discounts on Octopus Card were also issued.

=== Recent extensions ===

The MTR system has been extended numerous times since the railway merger. Relevant projects include the LOHAS Park spur line (2009), the Kowloon Southern Link (2009), the West Island line (2014), the Kwun Tong line extension (2016), the South Island line (2016), Tuen Ma line Phase 1 (2020) and Phase 2 (2021) and the East Rail line extension (2022).

The LOHAS Park Spur Line is an extension of the Tseung Kwan O line, splitting off after Tseung Kwan O station. It serves the new residential development of LOHAS Park (formerly &quot;Dream City&quot;), a estate with fifty residential towers. The project is divided into 9 to 13 phases and is about halfway complete as of 2016. These high rises sit above LOHAS Park station, which opened on 26 July 2009.

The West Island line, first put forward to the government on 21 January 2003, is an extension of the Island line. It serves the Western District of Hong Kong Island. The construction of the West Island line started on 10 August 2009. Kennedy Town station and HKU station opened on 28 December 2014. Sai Ying Pun station opened later, on 29 March 2015, due to construction delays.

A proposal to extend the existing Kwun Tong line to Whampoa Garden was made in April 2006 and approved in March 2008 as part of the bid for the Sha Tin to Central Link. Two new stations at Whampoa and Ho Man Tin opened on 23 October 2016.

The South Island line opened on 28 December 2016 between Admiralty and South Horizons, linking the MTR to Southern District for the first time. With the opening of the South Island line, all 18 districts of Hong Kong are served by the MTR.

The first section of the Tuen Ma line, an extension of the former Ma On Shan line connecting Tai Wai via Hin Keng and Diamond Hill to Kai Tak station, opened on 14 February 2020. The second and final section of the line was completed and opened on 27 June 2021, linking the previously opened Tuen Ma Line Phase One and the West Rail Line together connecting from Kai Tak station to Hung Hom station.

An extension of the East Rail line, phase two of the Sha Tin to Central Link (SCL) from Hung Hom station to Admiralty station across Victoria Harbour was completed and opened on 15 May 2022. An intermediate station was opened at Exhibition Centre.

== Future extensions ==

===Tuen Mun South extension===

The Tuen Mun South extension on the Tuen Ma line is a proposed extension to a new western terminus, Tuen Mun South, near Tuen Mun Ferry Pier. The extension will extend the line southwards from the current terminus at Tuen Mun station. It will include the construction of the A16 station (placeholder name used by MTR) and the new terminus Tuen Mun South station.

Additionally, the addition of a new infill station, Hung Shui Kiu station, along the Tuen Ma line between Siu Hong station and Tin Shui Wai station is currently under planning. It may be built depending on the development of the Hung Shui Kiu New Town.

===Northern Link===

The Northern Link is a proposed new line which connects Tuen Ma line with the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line of East Rail line. It also has Au Tau, Ngau Tam Mei, San Tin, a future interchange station between East Rail line and Northern Link, Kwu Tung, which will become a terminus for Northern link. This line would serve the future Northern Metropolis (which is in current planning) by the Hong Kong government. It would help to connect planned population centres isolated in the New Territories with Kowloon and Hong Kong.

Construction of Kwu Tung station began in 29 September 2023, and is expected to be completed in 2027, while construction of the Northern Link is expected to begin in 2025 and is scheduled to commence service in 2034.

===Tung Chung line extension===
The Tung Chung line extension will extend the Tung Chung line to the west by approximately 1.3 kilometres. Two new stations will also be built, namely; Tung Chung West and Tung Chung East, with Tung Chung West serving as the new terminus of the Tung Chung line. Construction began on 25 May 2023 and is expected to be completed in 2029. The Oyster Bay station is also a new station that will be built between Sunny Bay station and the future Tung Chung East station. It is expected to be complete in 2030.

===East Kowloon line===

The East Kowloon line is planned to serve the East Kowloon area to Tseung Kwan O New Town via the hilly Sau Mau Ping residential area.

===South Island line (West)===

The South Island line (West) was part of the same original proposal as the South Island line, and would connect HKU to Wong Chuk Hang around the west coast of Hong Kong Island, however, construction has not started .

===North Island line===

The North Island line is a planned extension of the Tseung Kwan O line that will interchange at the future Tamar station with the Tung Chung line. It will alleviate traffic in the northern part of Hong Kong Island. There will be three new stations: Tamar, Exhibition Centre (which will be an interchange between the North Island line and the North South Corridor), and Causeway Bay North. There is currently no proposed construction time for this line, however in the original proposal, construction was expected to begin in 2026 and commence service by 2040. The cost is estimated to be HK$20 billion in 2013 prices.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Rail network ===
=== Rolling stock ===
Nine types of electric multiple unit rolling stock operate on the MTR network and four generations of light rail vehicles operate on the light rail network. All use either rail gauge (near standard gauge) or (standard gauge). Except for Airport Express trains, all trains are designed to cope with high patronage, for example, through seating arrangements, wider train cars, additional ventilation fans, brighter train lighting, and additional sets of extra-wide doors. These configurations allow the MTR to run at up to 101,000 passengers per hour per direction (p/h/d) on its busy suburban East Rail line and around 85,000 p/h/d on its urban metro network.

==== Former rolling stock ====
==== Metro Cammell EMU (DC) ====
Known as M-trains, these are the oldest model of train in operation. M-Trains can be divided into different &quot;stocks&quot;. The M-stock (or &quot;CM-stock&quot;) of M-Train are the oldest trains on the MTR, built originally by Metro-Cammell (now Alstom) and refurbished by United Goninan. The M-train uses sliding doors, unlike K-stocks and Grupo CAF Trains which use plug doors. They are in service on Kwun Tong line, Tsuen Wan line, Island line and Tseung Kwan O line.

The Disneyland Resort line uses driverless M-trains with their appearance overhauled to suit the atmosphere and theme of the line. Windows on each carriage and the handrails inside are made into the shape of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s head, and there are bronze-made Disney characters decorating the interior of the carriages.

All 93 sets of the M-trains will be retired from service by 2030, and be replaced by the Q-Trains.

==== Adtranz-CAF EMU ====
The Tung Chung line and the Airport Express use CAF Trains tailored to their respective lines. Initially run in seven-car formations, they have now been lengthened to eight cars. These two variations are built jointly by Adtranz (now Bombardier Transportation) and Grupo CAF (CAF) between 1994 and 1997. Since 2006, K-stock has also been used on the Tung Chung line.

==== Rotem EMU (K-trains) ====
The K-stock was built jointly by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hyundai Rotem and first put into service on the Kwun Tong line. These were eventually transferred to the Tseung Kwan O line in 2009. Subsequently, in 2006, four additional sets joined the Tung Chung line to cope with the increasing passenger traffic. K-Stock trains have come under criticism when they were first put into service due to delays and door safety issues. Along with other service reliability issues, there have been incidents where passengers have been injured by its doors, leading to the MTRCL &quot;minimising the number of Korean trains for passenger service until a higher reliability of the systems concerned is achieved&quot;.

==== CNR Changchun EMU (C-trains) ====
A contract (C6554-07E) for 10 new sets of trains was awarded to Changchun Railway Vehicles Co. Limited in October 2008 with a further 12 trains ordered in the summer of 2011. These were delivered to Hong Kong between 2011 and 2013 to enhance train frequency on the existing lines to cater for increased patronage on the Island, Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan and Tseung Kwan O lines.
These trains feature new 22&quot; LCD TVs, like their counterparts on former KCR lines, and as a result are equipped with MTR In-Train TV, offering infotainment such as news and announcements. The first of these trains entered revenue service on 7 December 2011 on the Kwun Tong line.

The South Island line uses a similar train known as the S-train. Unlike the original C-train, the pantographs are on the &quot;A&quot; cars. All cars are powered, so there are no trailer cars. The S-train is also only three cars long and are driverless, with the driver&#x27;s cab removed to make standing space for passengers. However, the S-trains can still be operated manually in the event of an emergency.

==== SP1900/1950 EMU (IKK-trains) ====
The Tuen Ma line uses the SP1900, also known as the IKK (Itochu-Kinki-Kawasaki) train. The electrification system used on Tuen Ma line is , as opposed to the used on the urban lines. Should the need arise in the future, dual voltage trains such as those used on Oresund Bridge would be required.

The rolling stock is from the former KCRC network (KCR East Rail, West Rail and Ma On Shan Rail). They did not receive major changes after the merger of the two companies except for the updated route map, the exterior company logo and such. The capability of this EMU fleet is similar to those on the urban network. Starting from 2015, the West Rail and Ma On Shan line trains have been lengthened to 8 cars while the East Rail line 12 car sets have been withdrawn from the line in 2021. All train sets will receive larger TV displays and dynamic route map displays above every door, and will run on the Tuen Ma line in the future.

==== Hyundai Rotem EMU (R-stock) ====
In December 2012, the MTRC announced that new contracts had been awarded to Hyundai Rotem for 37 new nine-car trains to be used on the Sha Tin to Central Link. These trains are expected to replace the Metro Cammell EMUs that currently run on the East Rail line. The new R-stock trains are wider than existing units and can accommodate more passengers per car; however, the length of each train will be shortened from the current 12-car configuration used on the Metro Cammell and SP1900 EMUs to nine cars. This is due to space constraints imposed by new underground platforms on the Sha Tin to Central Link. MTR will also upgrade existing signalling systems used on the East Rail line which will enable trains to operate at two-minute headways on average, instead of the current three-minute interval, which the MTRC expects will be able to compensate for the loss of capacity resulting from the shorter trains. However, there are concerns from local residents that this will not be effective.

==== Light rail vehicles ====
Light rail rolling stock were ordered from four different manufacturers: Commonwealth Engineering (Comeng), Kawasaki Heavy Industries, United Goninan and CRRC Nanjing Puzhen. They are designed to run on the standard gauge and use delivered through overhead lines. Trains comprise one or two carriages, where the second carriage functions as only a trailer. The arrangement allows each car to carry approximately 300 passengers with 26 seats, while four sets of poach seats provide flexible riding for passengers.

The light rail trains are being modernised as part of a 20th anniversary activity. Trains will include better disabled facilities as well as a totally new interior. The MTR will refurbish 69 older trains (revised to 68 as one was scrapped following a traffic incident) and buy 22 new ones. The first trains have been completed and were scheduled to be put into service in November 2009. The whole project is expected to be completed in 2011.

Another batch of 40 Phase V trains have been ordered from CRRC Nanjing Puzhen, which will replace 30 Kawasaki Phase II trains which will not be refurbished, and the 10 additional trains will be used for enhancing services. The first pair of trains (leading + trailer car) entered service in 2020.

==== Maintenance trains ====

In addition to the passenger electric multiple units as covered above, MTR also uses various types of work trains for maintenance purposes:

* On the urban lines and Lantau Airport Railway, several different battery-electric locomotives and diesel locomotives are used to haul various work trains (including ultrasonic test vehicles and specialist wagons used for overhead wiring access, cable laying, rail transport, tunnel repair etc.), with the former being built by Brush Traction and the latter by Schöma. Like the passenger trains, they are also equipped with BSI couplers, albeit without the electrical connections. The locomotives were delivered in different phases:
** The battery electrics were delivered in three different phases. The first phase comprises five units numbered L51 to L55 which entered service in 1983 and are capable of hauling a maximum trailing load of 109 tonnes on a 3% of gradient. The second phase has six units numbered L56 to L61 which entered service in 1989. They have the same performance as the phase 1 units and can be assumed to be of the same general design. The pantograph is located atop the cab roof, with no sign of an air conditioner. The third phase comprises twenty units numbered L62 to L82 which entered service in 1996; most are used on the Lantau Airport Railway, but some on the urban lines. They are more powerful than the earlier units, being able to haul 160 tonnes. Their design is also slightly different to phase 2 units, with the pantograph at the opposite end, and an air conditioner above the cab.
** The Schöma diesel fleet came before the battery electrics. Capable of hauling 100 tonnes, they are presumed to have assisted in the construction of the network and came in three different phases: phase 1 (nine units numbered L11 to L19) in 1977, phase 2 (nine units numbered L20 to 28) in 1979 and phase 3 (eight units numbered L31 to L38) in 1983. They are presumed to be capable of multiple unit operation.
* On the ex-KCR lines, diesel locomotives such as the Eurorunner that were formerly used for freight services are now used on works trains and transferring EMUs trains between depots. Maintenance trains for the East Rail line are also largely stabled at Fo Tan depot.
* In 2015, MTR procured two new SF02T-FS rail milling machines from Linsinger. Instead of rail grinding, these machines mill the rail head, providing a more accurate profile and a higher quality processed surface. However, the machines are not without flaws and one of them caught fire on the Tsuen Kwan O Line on 9 May 2016 during maintenance hours.

=== Station facilities, amenities and services ===

The architecture of MTR stations is less artistic, instead focusing on structural practicability. With the high level of daily passenger traffic, facilities of the MTR stations are built with durability and accessibility in mind. After extensive retrofitting, the MTR system has become, in general, disabled-friendly—the trains have dedicated wheelchair space, the stations have special floor tiles to guide the blind safely on the platforms, and there are extra wide entry and exit gates for wheelchairs as well. Portable ramp for wheelchair users are available for boarding and alighting trains. On board the rolling stock, there are also flashing system maps on select trains while Active Line Diagrams and traditional route maps are installed on the others. Infopanels as well as on MTR In-Train TV onboard trains display important messages such as next station announcements as well as operational messages.

==== Telecommunications ====
LTE (4G) and 5G mobile phone network is in place throughout the whole MTR system of stations and tunnels allowing passengers to stay connected to the internet underground. Currently, there is full 5G network coverage in all stations and tunnels (except certain underground sections on the East Rail line and Tuen Ma line) for the MTR system has been provided by 3 Hong Kong, SmarTone and PCCW. Passengers are able to use high-speed internet on their mobile phones regardless whether the train is above ground or under ground. The MTR has already extended the Wi-Fi service to all of the Airport Express trains and the expansion of the service to other MTR routes is still under consideration by MTR. All 99 stations on the MTR offer free Wi-Fi service with a limit of 15 minutes per session and a maximum of five sessions per day.

In late 2015 it was announced that all 400 payphones in the MTR system would be removed in early 2016. The contract with the service provider, Shinetown Telecom, was expiring, and the MTR Corporation said that no one had tendered a proposal to take over the contract. As a result, the MTR system no longer has payphones.

==== Announcements ====
When the system opened, public announcements were made in British English and Cantonese by train captains and station staff. In 1992, the announcements were standardised, pre-recorded by RTHK presenter Cheri Chan Yu-yan (), who is now an assistant professor of English-language education at the University of Hong Kong, and who remains the voice of the MTR today. Since 2004, to accommodate Mainland Chinese visitors under the Individual Visit Scheme, Mandarin Chinese was added to the repertory.

==== Public toilets ====
Unlike many other metro systems around the world, &quot;main line&quot; MTR stations originally did not have toilet facilities available for public use. Passengers may use MTR staff toilets at all stations on request. In 2006, MTRCL said it would not consider retrofitting existing underground toilets, because of the challenge of installing new piping and toilet facilities. Only stations on the Airport Express, Tung Chung line and Disneyland Resort line had access to toilet facilities. All former KCR stations (on the East Rail line and Tuen Ma line), merged into the MTR network in 2007, have public toilets.

During the Legislative Council rail merger bill discussions, the MTR Corporation was criticised by legislators for their unwillingness to install toilets in main line stations. MTRCL indicated that it would carry out a review of the feasibility of installing public toilets at or in the vicinity of its above-ground railway stations. Discussions between the Government and MTRCL have taken into account LegCo members&#x27; request for a stronger commitment by the corporation to the provision of public toilets on new railway lines. This resulted in MTRCL agreeing to include the provision of toilets within, or adjacent to, stations in the overall design parameters for all future new railway lines, subject to planning and regulatory approval and any concerns raised by residents in the vicinity about the location of external ventilation exhausts.

Toilets have since been retrofitted into several existing MTR stations, including Sheung Wan station, Ngau Tau Kok station, Quarry Bay station, Mong Kok station, Prince Edward station, and Admiralty station. In addition, newly opened stations such as those of the West Island line have toilets. The MTR has installed public toilets at all interchanges as of 2023.

In late 2017, the MTR introduced breastfeeding rooms at 20 interchange stations. The rooms are located in back of house areas, and are available upon request to MTR staff.

==== Commerce and journals ====
Prior to the privatisation of MTRC, MTR stations only had branches of the Hang Seng Bank, Maxim&#x27;s Cakes stores, and a handful of other shops. Since then, the number and types of shops have increased at stations has increased, turning some of them into miniature shopping centres. ATMs and convenience stores are now commonplace.

The MTR has contracted with publishers for the distribution of free magazines and newspapers in MTR stations. &quot;Recruit&quot; was the first free magazine which was solely distributed in stations (before railway merger) since July 1992, but the contract was terminated in July 2002. Another recruitment magazine &quot;Jiu Jik&quot; (招職), published by &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, replaced &quot;Recruit&quot; as the only free recruitment magazine distributed in MTR stations bi-weekly. The &quot;Metropolis Daily&quot; (都市日報), published by Metro International, is the first free newspaper distributed free in MTR stations during weekdays (except public holidays); and in 2005, there is another weekend newspaper &quot;Express Post&quot; (快線週報), distributed every Saturday except public holidays. The &quot;Metropop&quot; (都市流行), a weekly magazine featuring cultural affairs and city trends also published by Metro International, started its distribution in MTR stations every Thursday since 27 April 2006, a few months after the termination of &quot;Hui Kai Guide&quot; (去街 Guide) in 2006. MTR Stations on ex-KCR lines feature two free Chinese-language newspapers, namely &quot;am730&quot; and &quot;Headline Daily&quot;. MTR promotes reading of these newspapers by adding special coupons and promotion offers inside the newspapers, for example, a free trip to Lok Ma Chau or a free keyring. On the Kwun Tong line, East Rail line and Tuen Ma line, &quot;MTR In-Train TV&quot; is available.

=== MTR Bus ===

At various stations of the MTR network, the MTRCL (which took over from KCR) operates feeder buses which enhance the convenience of taking the MTR. These bus routes, which normally consist of one to two stops, terminate at housing estates and go past major landmarks. The feeder bus routes on the East Rail line are run under the MTR name but are operated by Kowloon Motor Bus.

=== Signalling ===

Throughout its history, MTR has used different signalling systems for its lines. The main Operations Control Centre for the entire network is located at Tsing Yi. Previous control centres were located at Fo Tan and Kam Tin for the East Rail line, Ma On Shan line and West Rail line.

On the pre-merger MTR network, wayside signals are simple two-aspect signals whose colours are namely red for &quot;stop&quot; and blue for &quot;proceed according to ATO&quot;; this is made possible by the use of automatic train operation (ATO) which provides the onboard equipment the permitted speeds via undercarriage antennas located underneath the cab whereas the signals having been sent by radio transmitters located between the rails. An automatic train protection (ATP) is also used to enforce safety.

In 1998, transmission balise-locomotive (TBL) was implemented on the East Rail line to monitor train safety. Subsequently, in 2002, ATO was also implemented on the East Rail line. However, the original British-style Automatic Warning System is still retained for use by Intercity-Through Trains. On the other hand, the Tuen Ma line uses a SelTrac moving block communications-based train control (CBTC) system from Alcatel Canada (now Thales Group). The SelTrac system is also used by the fully automated Disneyland Resort line, whereas the South Island line uses another signalling supplier, Alstom, Urbalis 400 CBTC system.

As part of RailGen 2.0 implemented from 2014 onwards to improve the standards of the rail network, the signalling systems on the older lines are to be replaced with new CBTC systems; the system used for the pre-merger network will be replaced with Alstom-Thales SelTrac whereas that for the East Rail line will be replaced by Siemens Trainguard CBTC. However, the signalling upgrades encountered a serious setback in the form of a train collision outside Central station on 18 March 2019.

=== Head office ===

The MTR Headquarters Building is located at Telford Plaza. It is a part of the larger Telford Garden complex, which was developed as part of a partnership between MTR and private development companies.

Telford Plaza held an exhibition dedicated to the history of MTR in April 2014.

== Fares and tickets ==
After the rail merger, there are three different fare classes on the MTR: Adult, Students and Concessionary. Only children below the age of 12 and senior citizens 65 years or older are eligible for the concessionary rate on all lines. Full-time Hong Kong students between the ages of 12 and 25 qualify for the concessionary rate using a personalised Octopus Card on all lines except on Airport Express, or travel to or from cross-border stations (Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau). Children below the age of 3 travel free (unless they exceed the height range).

The fare of MTR between any two particular stations is not calculated using a particular formula, and must be looked up from the fare table. Fares for the Airport Express Line are significantly higher. Services to checkpoint termini are also more expensive than ordinary fares, as are journeys that require a harbour crossing than are journeys that do not. Adult fares range from HK$3.6 to $52.6 (US$0.46–6.74). Concessionary fares are usually half the adult fare, and range from HK$1.50 to $27.00. Student fares are the same as child and elderly fare on the urban lines, but are the same as the Adult fares for journeys to or from checkpoint termini, and range from HK$1.50 to $51.00. The fare is subject to adjustment in June every year.

Prior to May 2009, MTR did not provide concessionary fares for the disabled. Legislators such as social welfare constituency legislator Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung and those from Hong Kong&#x27;s Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood had for years demanded that such concessions be put in place. In May 2009, MTR eventually agreed to offer the disabled concessionary fares with HK$2 million sponsorship from Transport and Housing Bureau and under the condition that Legislative Council amends the &quot;Disability Discrimination Ordinance&quot;.

Single journey tickets can be purchased at vending machines while tourist passes, Octopus cards and other special tickets must be purchased at the ticket counter. Credit cards are only accepted to purchase Airport Express tickets and tourist Octopus cards from automatic vending machines located within Hong Kong airport.

There are also frequent-user passes, such as the MTR City Saver, which is valid at 67 stations and can be used for 40 trips over 40 days, and the Tuen Mun-Nam Cheong day pass, which is valid for unlimited travel for one day on a portion of the Tuen Ma line.

=== Octopus cards ===

The Octopus card is a reusable contactless stored value smart card for making electronic payments in online or offline systems in Hong Kong developed by Australian company ERG Group.

Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory&#x27;s mass transit system, the Octopus card system became the world&#x27;s second contactless smart card system, after the Korean Upass, and has since grown into a widely used payment system for all public transport in Hong Kong. Octopus&#x27;s success has led to the development of the Navigo card in Paris, the Oyster card in London, the Opal card in New South Wales, NETS FlashPay, EZ-Link in Singapore, and other similar systems.

The Octopus card has also evolved for use as payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong, including convenience stores, supermarkets, and fast-food restaurants. Other common Octopus payment applications include parking meters, car parks, petrol stations, vending machines, fee payment at public libraries and swimming pools, and more. The cards are also used for non-payment purposes, such as school attendance and access control for office buildings and housing estates.

=== Tourist pass ===
The Tourist Day Pass gives tourists unlimited MTR rides (with the exception of MTR Bus routes, the First Class section of the East Rail line, the Airport Express, as well as journeys to and from Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Racecourse stations) for 24 hours from the point of first entry . Each pass costs HK$65 and is available at all the MTR Customer Service Centres. Tourist Day Pass must be used within 30 days upon the day of issue. The Airport Express Tourist Octopus Cards are also available. Cardholders may enjoy three days of unlimited rides on the MTR (except Airport Express, East Rail line First Class, and journeys involving Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau stations) refundable deposit of HK$50 and choice of either a single (HK$220) or round trip (HK$300) on the Airport Express.

=== Other fares ===
A touchless smart card system is used for single journey tickets. These tickets are pre-paid for between pre-determined stations, and are good for only one trip. There are no return tickets, except on the Airport Express. As of mid-2013, less than five per cent of MTR customers travelled on single journey tickets.

Fares for the Airport Express are substantially different from main line fares. Apart from single tickets, same-day return tickets (same price as a single), and one-month return tickets are also available.

A one-day pass was able to be purchased for unlimited travel to and from Hong Kong Disneyland within the same day, from 2005 to 2011, and cost HK$50. This pass could be purchased from any MTR Customer Service Centres or Airport Express Customer Service Centres.

=== Ticket recommendation ===
Ticket Suggestion and Route Suggestion functions are available on the MTR website; based on trip destination and travel pattern, they can recommend the lowest price ticket type for daily and non-daily commuters.

Third parties, such as MTR Service Update, have also developed ticket recommendation capabilities, claiming to be more user-friendly and fare-saving. The Checkfare function at MTR Service Update can recommend whether to interchange at Tsim Sha Tsui or East Tsim Sha Tsui, to receive a better discount.


== Performance ==

Since the merger in 2007, MTR has consistently achieved a 99.9% on-time rate, meaning 999 of every 1,000 passengers arrives at their destination within 5 minutes of scheduled time. In 2013, out of the 5.2 million passengers the MTR averaged each workday, 5.195 million passengers were considered to have arrived &quot;on time&quot;. This makes the MTR one of the most efficient major public transport networks on the planet. MTR must report all delays of more than eight minutes to the government. There were 143 reportable incidents in 2013. MTR is fined HK$1 million for having delays of 30 minutes to an hour, with higher fines for longer delays.

== Regulations and safety ==

According to the Mass Transit Railway By-laws, eating, drinking, or smoking are not allowed in the paid area of stations or in trains. Offenders will be fined up to HK$5000.

Various campaigns and activities are taken to help ensure that the MTR is a safe system to travel on. Poster campaigns displaying information on topics such as escalator safety are a common sight in all MTR stations, and announcements are made regularly as safety reminders to travelling passengers. By-laws were also introduced to deter potentially dangerous actions on the MTR, such as the ban on flammable goods on the MTR and rushing into trains when the doors are closing. Penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment have been imposed for such offences.

Police officers patrol the trains and stations, and police posts are available at some stations. The Hong Kong Police Force has a Railway District responsible for the MTR. Closed-circuit television cameras are installed in stations and on some of the newer trains.

The entire Tung Chung line and Airport Express, as well as the stations added by the Tseung Kwan O line, has platform screen doors (PSDs), ordered from Swiss glass door manufacturer Kaba Gilgen AG, installed upon construction. So does the entire Tuen Ma line, inherited from KCR. These doors make platforms safer by preventing people from falling onto the rails, even though MTRCL did not heavily promote it directly. However, the primary motivation was to separate the stations from the tunnels, hence allowing substantial energy savings on station air-conditioning and tunnel ventilation. Automatic platform gates (APGs) have also been installed at the Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort stations. Their heights are half of the PSDs and only prevent people from falling onto the rails. MTR has finished installing the APGs on all of the above-ground stations of the MTR except on the East Rail line; they will be installed there as part of the Sha Tin to Central Link project.

In June 2000, MTRCL proceeded with plans to retrofit 2,960 pairs of platform screen doors at all 30 underground stations on the Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan, and Island lines in a six-year programme. The programme made MTR the world&#x27;s first railway to undertake the retrofitting of PSDs on a passenger-carrying system already in operation. A prototype design was first introduced at Choi Hung station in the 3rd quarter of 2001. The scheme was completed in October 2005, ahead of the forecast completion date in 2006. MTRCL said that part of the cost had to be assumed by passengers. HK$0.10 per passenger trip was levied on Octopus card users to help fund the HK$2 billion retrofit programme. This levy was ended in 2013 after raising more than HK$1 billion.

== Visual identity ==
The MTR visual identity, which includes logo, vehicle livery, signage, route maps and passenger information, was updated in 1995–1998 by Lloyd Northover, the British design consultancy founded by John Lloyd and Jim Northover.

MTR has a mascot named &quot;Kee Gor&quot;, modeled after a former MTR employee who headed operations.

== Social outreach ==
=== Art promotion ===
With the objective &quot;not only bring MTR passengers more time for life, but also more time for art&quot;, the Art in MTR Initiative has been a success since its reception in 1998, where the Airport Express Artwork Programme was the pioneer project. Thereafter, live performances, art exhibitions, display of artwork by established and emerging artists, students and young children have been brought into the MTR stations. MTRCL have even made art part of the station architecture when building new stations or renovating existing ones. Artworks are exhibited in different forms on the network, including &quot;arttube&quot;, open art gallery, community art galleries, roving art, living art, and art in station architecture.

=== MTR Hong Kong Race Walking ===
MTR and Hong Kong Association of Athletics Affiliates have jointly hosted MTR Hong Kong Race Walking annually in spring since 2005. The race walking competition aims at promoting healthy living in Hong Kong. The race begins and ends on the ground above Central MTR station, namely Chater Garden, Chater Road, Ice House Street and Des Voeux Road Central in Central. There is a fun walk apart from the regular competition. The event attracted over 800 participants in 2005 and 1,500 in 2012. The event is attended not only by Hongkongers, but also athletes from various countries. The race raises fund for Better Health for a Better Hong Kong, a Hospital Authority project for the working population.

== Controversies ==

=== Tree removal ===
The MTR Corporation came under fire in June 2011 after their work on the cross-border high-speed railway line encroached on a conservation area in Pat Heung, Yuen Long. 34 trees were felled and an entire slope was concreted over in the conservation area. The Environmental Protection Department issued summonses to the corporation for offences under the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance. In September 2011, a fine of HK$15,000 was imposed by the court. The MTR Corporation admitted that 34 trees were felled by mistake; all were common native woodland species and no rare tree species were affected. The corporation said owing to a technical misalignment of relevant drawings, the plan submitted to the Environmental Protection Department did not include the part of the Conservation Area which was included in the gazettal plan of their works. The corporation became aware that part of the approved tree removal works may have encroached onto the Conservation Area during construction, and proactively reported the situation to the government. Evaluation and measures have been taken to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

The MTR Corporation came under fire again in September 2011 after felling dozens of trees in Admiralty as part of construction work for the South Island line. Green activists denounced the tree felling as &quot;unprofessional&quot;, and Ken So Kwok-yin, chief executive of the Conservancy Association and a certified tree arborist, said that the explanations offered by the MTR Corporation as to why the trees were felled were &quot;unacceptable&quot;. The MTR Corporation is felling approximately 4,000 trees for the construction of the South Island line, raising concerns from environmental groups and the public about its commitment to protecting Hong Kong&#x27;s natural environment.

=== Limits on oversized luggage ===

The corporation has limits on the size of items allowed on trains. The MTR system is facing pressure from increasing numbers of parallel traders who carry oversized baggage onto trains for resale in China. The corporation has been criticised for allowing parallel traders to board trains with massive bags, causing undue congestion and inconvenience to residents of the North District.

Furthermore, the corporation accused of double standards in enforcement when images of cross-border smugglers pushing overladen trollies appeared on social network sites on a regular basis, whilst local students carrying large musical instruments were reported to have been stopped and issued with written warnings. Leading musicians joined in the criticism of MTR&#x27;s stance on large instruments; some citizens invited players of cellos and other large instruments to congregate on 3 October 2015 with their equipment at Tai Wai station, where the majority of these instances occurred.

Following the public uproar, MTR issued a press release in the early hours acknowledging discontent and announcing a one-month review of the policy on oversized items to see whether there was room for fine-tuning that would not compromise on passenger safety. The corporation said that staff would continue executing existing policy until any revisions are made.

=== October 2018 disruption ===
On 16 October 2018, four MTR lines suffered delays simultaneously, an unprecedented disruption to railway services. MTR stated that initial investigations showed that the problems were related to the computers that control the signalling system, and an in-depth investigation would be carried out.

=== Cathay Pacific advertisement ===
In May 2019, the MTR Corporation and the Airport Authority Hong Kong reportedly refused to display a Cathay Pacific advertisement featuring two men holding hands due to its LGBT message.

=== Involvement in 2019–20 Hong Kong protests ===
==== Yuen Long attack ====

On 21 July 2019, a mob of men dressed in white and carrying wooden sticks and metal pipes entered the MTR&#x27;s Yuen Long station and assaulted people indiscriminately. The attack is largely believed to have been carried out by pro-Beijing paid thugs. One pregnant woman was hurt and found lying on the floor, and journalists were also attacked. The mob entered the paid area and attacked commuters aboard a train, which was unable to depart. Over 40 people were sent to hospital. After the incident, pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho was accused of supporting the attack.

==== Prince Edward station attack ====

On 31 August 2019, during the anti-extradition bill protests, Special Tactical Squad officers of the Hong Kong Police Force entered Prince Edward station and attacked people inside. They fired tear gas inside the station and trains, violating guidelines on the use of such products in enclosed spaces. Bystanders were caught in the operation and it has generally been deemed a brutal attempt to stop the protests. Widespread rumours of civilian deaths at the station circulated after discrepancies were noted regarding the number of injuries. The MTR refused to provide CCTV footage filmed during the incident, helping to perpetuate these rumours.

==== Halting of services ====
On multiple occasions during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, MTR has sealed off stations close to locations of protest before their starting time. Supporters of the protests have thus criticised MTR of intentionally impeding the public from attending protests and unnecessarily affecting civilians, giving MTR the nickname &quot;CCP railway&quot; (Chinese: 黨鐵; ).

Following a clash between police and protestors in the Yuen Long station on 21 August 2019, the Chinese state media People&#x27;s Daily published a commentary accusing MTR of &quot;conspiring with protestors&quot; by &quot;arranging special free trains for rioters to escape&quot;. In response to the accusation, MTR issued a statement declaring that it will close stations under emergency situations in the future. After that, MTR has on multiple occasions closed off stations close to ongoing protests, for example closing the Lam Tin station, Kwun Tong station and Ngau Tau Kok station on 24 August 2020 before the starting time of a permitted demonstration in Kwun Tong. Similar incidents of varying scale have occurred multiple times later.

==== Arrangement of train for riot police ====
On 24 August 2019, MTR arranged a special train exclusively to carry riot police to Kowloon Bay station, which was closed to the public at that time due to the demonstration nearby at Kwun Tong. This has led to criticisms that MTR is assisting the government in oppressing the freedom of assembly and the freedom of expression in Hong Kong.

<doc id="267014" wikidata="Q4437154" url="?curid=267014" title="List of topics characterized as pseudoscience">
<text>This is a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by academics or researchers, either currently or in the past. Detailed discussion of these topics may be found on their main pages. These characterizations were made in the context of educating the public about questionable or potentially fraudulent or dangerous claims and practices, efforts to define the nature of science, or humorous parodies of poor scientific reasoning.

Criticism of pseudoscience, generally by the scientific community or skeptical organizations, involves critiques of the logical, methodological, or rhetorical bases of the topic in question. Though some of the listed topics continue to be investigated scientifically, others were only subject to scientific research in the past and today are considered refuted, but resurrected in a pseudoscientific fashion. Other ideas presented here are entirely non-scientific, but have in one way or another impinged on scientific domains or practices.

Many adherents or practitioners of the topics listed here dispute their characterization as pseudoscience. Each section here summarizes the alleged pseudoscientific aspects of that topic.

== Physical sciences ==
=== Astronomy and space sciences ===
* 2012 phenomenon – a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or otherwise transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in countries where the Maya civilization had formerly flourished (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala. Professional Mayanist scholars stated that no extant classic Maya accounts forecast impending doom and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Maya history and culture, while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.
* Ancient astronauts – a concept based on the belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistoric times. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of modern cultures, technologies and religions. A common claim is that deities from most, if not all, religions are actually extraterrestrial in origin and that advanced technologies brought to Earth by ancient astronauts were interpreted as evidence of divine status by early humans. The idea that ancient astronauts existed is not taken seriously by academics and has received no credible attention in peer-reviewed studies.
:* Anunnaki from Nibiru (Sitchin) (&quot;variant&quot;) – proposed by Zecharia Sitchin in his series &quot;The Earth Chronicles&quot;, beginning with &quot;The 12th Planet&quot; (1976), it revolves around Sitchin&#x27;s unique interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts from around the world. He hypothesizes that the gods of old Mesopotamia were actually astronauts from the planet &quot;Nibiru&quot;, which Sitchin claims the Sumerians believed was a remote &quot;12th planet&quot; (counting the Sun, Moon and Pluto as planets) associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit.
:* Ancient astronauts from the Sirius star-system (Temple) (&quot;variant&quot;) – Robert K. G. Temple&#x27;s proposal in his book &quot;The Sirius Mystery&quot; (1976) argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including supposed advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Sumer.
* Astrology (see also Astrology and science) – consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Several systems of divination are based on the relative positions and movement of various real and construed celestial bodies. Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted and no evidence has been found to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.
* Creationist cosmologies are explanations of the origins and form of the universe in terms of the Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1), according to which the God of the Bible created the cosmos in eight creative acts over the six days of the &quot;creation week&quot;.
* Evidence for life on Mars
:* The Face on Mars is a rock formation in Cydonia Mensae on Mars asserted to be evidence of intelligent, native life on the planet. High-resolution images taken recently show it to appear less face-like. It features prominently in the works of Richard C. Hoagland and Tom Van Flandern. This effect can also be explained by the psychological phenomenon pareidolia, whereby one assigns meaning (such as facial perception) to an otherwise ambiguous or meaningless stimulus.
* Lunar effect – the belief that the full Moon influences human and animal behavior.
* Modern flat Earth beliefs propose that Earth is a flat, disc-shaped planet that accelerates upward, producing the illusion of gravity. Proposers of a flat Earth, such as the Flat Earth Research Society, do not accept compelling evidence, such as photos of Earth from space.
* Modern geocentrism – In astronomy, the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism or the Ptolemaic system) is a superseded description of the universe with Earth at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars and planets all circled Earth. The geocentric model served as the predominant description of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle and Ptolemy.
* Moon landing conspiracy theories – claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the six crewed landings (1969–72) were faked and that 12 Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened by manufacturing, tampering with or destroying evidence, including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions and Moon rock samples, and even killing some key witnesses.
* Nibiru cataclysm – a prediction first made by contactee Nancy Lieder that a mythological planet Nibiru would collide with Earth. After having adjusted her prediction many times, she later claimed the year of the occurrence to be 2012. In 2017, a conspiracy theorist known as David Meade claimed 2017 was the year Nibiru would hit.
* Vaimānika Shāstra – claim that airplanes were invented in ancient India during the Vedic period. A 1974 study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore found that the heavier-than-air aircraft that the &quot;Vaimānika Shāstra&quot; described were aerodynamically unfeasible. The authors remarked that the discussion of the principles of flight in the text were largely perfunctory and incorrect, in some cases violating Newton&#x27;s laws of motion.
* Worlds in Collision – writer Immanuel Velikovsky proposed in his book &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; that ancient texts and geographic evidence show mankind was witness to catastrophic interactions of other planets in our Solar System.

=== Earth sciences ===
* Megalithic geometry or 366 geometry – posits the existence of an Earth-based geometry dating back to at least 3500 BCE and the possibility that such a system is still in use in modern Freemasonry. According to proponents, megalithic civilizations in Britain and Brittany had advanced knowledge of geometry and the size of Earth. The megalithic yard is correlated to the polar circumference of Earth using a circle divided into 366 degrees.
* The Bermuda Triangle – a region of the Atlantic Ocean that lies between Bermuda, Puerto Rico and (in its most popular version) Florida. Ship and aircraft disasters and disappearances perceived as frequent in this area have led to the circulation of stories of unusual natural phenomena, paranormal encounters and interactions with extraterrestrials.
* Climate change denial – involves denial, dismissal, unwarranted doubt or contrarian views which depart from the scientific consensus on climate change, including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its impacts on nature and human society, or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions.
* Flood geology – creationist form of geology that advocates most of the geologic features on Earth are explainable by a global flood.
* The Hollow Earth – a proposal that Earth is either entirely hollow or consists of hollow sections beneath the crust. Certain folklore and conspiracy theories hold this idea and suggest the existence of subterranean life.
* Welteislehre, a.k.a. the World Ice Theory or Glacial Cosmogony – ice is proposed to be the basic substance of all cosmic processes and ice moons, ice planets and the &quot;global ether&quot; (also made of ice) had determined the entire development of the universe.

=== Physics ===
* Autodynamics – a physics theory proposed in the 1940s that claims the equations of the Lorentz transformation are incorrectly formulated to describe relativistic effects, which would invalidate Einstein&#x27;s theories of special relativity and general relativity, and Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The theory is discounted by the mainstream physics community.
* E-Cat – a claimed cold fusion reactor.
* Einstein–Cartan–Evans theory – a unified theory of physics proposed by Myron Wyn Evans which claims to unify general relativity, quantum mechanics and electromagnetism. The hypothesis was largely published in the journal &quot;Foundations of Physics Letters&quot; between 2003 and 2005; in 2008, the editor published an editorial note effectively retracting the journal&#x27;s support for the hypothesis due to incorrect mathematical claims.
* Electrogravitics – claimed to be an unconventional type of effect or anti-gravity propulsion created by an electric field&#x27;s effect on a mass. The name was coined in the 1920s by Thomas Townsend Brown, who first described the effect and spent most of his life trying to develop it and sell it as a propulsion system. Follow-ups on the claims (R. L. Talley in a 1990 U.S. Air Force study, NASA scientist Jonathan Campbell in a 2003 experiment and Martin Tajmar in a 2004 paper) have found that no thrust could be observed in a vacuum, consistent with the phenomenon of ion wind.
* Free energy – a class of perpetual motion that purports to create energy (violating the first law of thermodynamics) or extract useful work from equilibrium systems (violating the second law of thermodynamics).
:* Water-fueled cars – an instance of perpetual motion machines. Such devices are claimed to use water as fuel or produce fuel from water on board with no other energy input. Many such claims are part of investment frauds.
:* Gasoline pill or &quot;gasoline powder&quot;, which was claimed to turn water into gasoline.
:* Hongcheng Magic Liquid – a scam in China in which Wang Hongcheng (Chinese: 王洪成; pinyin: Wáng Hóngchéng), a bus driver from Harbin with no scientific education, claimed in 1983 that he could turn regular water into a fuel as flammable as petrol by simply dissolving a few drops of his liquid in it.
* Hydrinos (Randell L. Mills/Brilliant Light Power Inc.) – a supposed state of the hydrogen atom that, according to Mills, is of lower energy than ground state and has extremely high efficiency as a fuel. Critics say it lacks corroborating scientific evidence and is a relic of cold fusion. Critical analysis of the claims have been published in the peer-reviewed journals &quot;Physics Letters A&quot;, &quot;New Journal of Physics&quot;, &quot;Journal of Applied Physics&quot;, and &quot;Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics&quot; stating that the proposed hydrino states are unphysical and incompatible with key equations of quantum mechanics.
*Orgone – a pseudoscientific concept described as an esoteric energy or hypothetical universal life force, originally proposed in the 1930s.

== Applied sciences ==
=== Agriculture ===

* Lysenkoism, or Lysenko-Michurinism – was a political campaign against genetics and science-based agriculture conducted by Trofim Lysenko, his followers and Soviet authorities. Lysenko served as the director of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964. The pseudoscientific ideas of Lysenkoism built on Lamarckian concepts of the heritability of acquired characteristics. Lysenko&#x27;s theory rejected Mendelian inheritance and the concept of the &quot;gene&quot;; it departed from Darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection, viewing that concept as being incompatible with Marxist ideology.
* Biodynamic agriculture – method of organic farming that treats farms as unified and individual organisms. Biodynamics uses a calendar which has been characterized as astrological. The substances and composts used by biodynamicists have been described as unconventional and homeopathic. For example, field mice are countered by deploying ashes prepared from field mice skin when Venus is in the Scorpius constellation. No difference in beneficial outcomes has been scientifically established between certified biodynamic agricultural techniques and similar organic and integrated farming practices. Biodynamic agriculture lacks strong scientific evidence for its efficacy and has been labeled a pseudoscience because of its overreliance upon esoteric knowledge and mystical beliefs.
* GMO skepticism – The belief that genetically modified foods are inherently unsafe. This contradicts the scientific consensus.

=== Architecture ===
* Feng shui – ancient Chinese system of mysticism and aesthetics based on astronomy, geography and the putative flow of &quot;qi&quot;. Evidence for its effectiveness is based on anecdote and there is a lack of a plausible method of action; this leads to conflicting advice from different practitioners of feng shui. Feng shui practitioners use this as evidence of variations or different schools; critical analysts have described it thus: &quot;Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork.&quot; Modern criticism differentiates between feng shui as a traditional proto-religion and the modern practice: &quot;A naturalistic belief, it was originally used to find an auspicious dwelling place for a shrine or a tomb. However, over the centuries it...has become distorted and degraded into a gross superstition.&quot;
* Ley lines – proposed intentional alignment of ancient monuments and landscape features was later explained by a statistical analysis of lines that concluded: &quot;the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will &#x27;clip&#x27; a number of sites.&quot; Additional New Age and feng shui concepts have been proposed building on the original concept and pseudoscientific claims about energy flowing through the lines have been made.
* Minimum parking requirements – system for assigning an optimal number of parking spaces to a given land use. It is characterized as a pseudoscience by UCLA planning professor Donald Shoup, especially as practiced by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. He argues that the ITE&#x27;s calculations are arcane, overly specific, and typically based on minimal data and approximations that cannot be widely applied to other businesses, even of the same type, and yet are presented as science-backed.
* Vastu shastra is the ancient Hindu system of architecture, which lays down a series of rules for building houses in relation to ambiance. Vastu Shastra is considered pseudoscience by rationalists like Narendra Nayak of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations and astronomer Jayant Narlikar, who writes that Vastu does not have any &quot;logical connection&quot; to the environment.

=== Finance ===
* Technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. It is still considered by many academics to be pseudoscience. Academics such as Eugene Fama say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the &quot;weak form&quot; of the efficient-market hypothesis.

=== Health and medicine ===
Pseudoscientific medical practices are often known as quackery. In contrast, modern medicine is (or seeks to be) evidence-based.
*The abortion–breast cancer hypothesis posits that having an induced abortion can increase the risk of breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is rejected by major medical professional organizations.
*Access Consciousness is an alternative medicine technique similar to a combination of phrenology, reiki, energy therapies and therapeutic touch, where health and wellness can be improved by touching the 32 &quot;Energy Bars&quot; on a person&#x27;s head. 
* Acupuncture – use of fine needles to stimulate &quot;acupuncture points&quot; and balance the flow of &quot;qi&quot;. There is no known anatomical or histological basis for the existence of &quot;acupuncture points&quot; or &quot;meridians&quot; and acupuncture is regarded as an alternative medical procedure. Some acupuncturists regard them as functional rather than structural entities, useful in guiding evaluation and care of patients. Acupuncture has been the subject of active scientific research since the late 20th century and its effects and application remain controversial among medical researchers and clinicians. Some scholarly reviews conclude that acupuncture&#x27;s effects are mainly attributable to the placebo effect and others find likelihood of efficacy for particular conditions.
** Dry needling is the therapeutic insertion of fine needles without regard to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and is similarly controversial.
** Acupressure is an alternative medicine technique similar in principle to acupuncture. It is based on the concept of life energy, which flows through &quot;meridians&quot; in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices. Some studies have suggested it may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, lower back pain, tension headaches and stomach ache, although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias. Like many alternative medicines, it may benefit from a placebo effect. Quackwatch says acupressure is a dubious practice and its practitioners use irrational methods.
* Adrenal fatigue or hypoadrenia is a pseudoscientific diagnosis described as a state in which the adrenal glands are exhausted and unable to produce adequate quantities of hormones, primarily the glucocorticoid cortisol, due to chronic stress or infections. Adrenal fatigue should not be confused with a number of actual forms of adrenal dysfunction such as adrenal insufficiency or Addison&#x27;s disease. The term &quot;adrenal fatigue&quot;, which was invented in 1998 by James Wilson, a chiropractor, may be applied to a collection of mostly nonspecific symptoms. There is no scientific evidence supporting the concept of adrenal fatigue and it is not recognized as a diagnosis by any scientific or medical community. A systematic review found no evidence for the existence of adrenal fatigue, confirming the consensus among endocrinological societies that it is a myth.
* The Alexander Technique, named after its creator Frederick Matthias Alexander, is an educational process that was created to retrain habitual patterns of movement and posture. Alexander believed that poor habits in posture and movement damaged spatial self-awareness as well as health and that movement efficiency could support overall physical well-being. He saw the technique as a mental training technique as well. Alexander began developing his technique&#x27;s principles in the 1890s in an attempt to address voice loss during public speaking. He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for reciting in Shakespearean theater. Some proponents of the Alexander Technique say that it addresses a variety of health conditions related to cumulative physical behaviors, but there is little evidence to support many of the claims made about the technique. As of 2015, there was evidence suggesting the Alexander Technique may be helpful for both long-term back pain and long-term neck pain and may help people cope with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, both Aetna and the Australian Department of Health have conducted reviews and concluded that the technique has insufficient evidence to warrant insurance coverage.
* Alternative cancer treatments are alternative or complementary treatments for cancer that have not been approved by the government agencies responsible for the regulation of therapeutic goods and have not undergone properly conducted, well-designed clinical trials. Among those that have been published, the methodology is often poor. A 2006 systematic review of 214 articles covering 198 clinical trials of alternative cancer treatments concluded that almost none conducted dose-ranging studies, which are necessary to ensure that the patients are being given a useful amount of the treatment. These kinds of treatments appear and vanish frequently and have done so throughout history.
* Alternative or fringe medicine – The terms &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, &quot;complementary medicine&quot;, &quot;integrative medicine,&quot; &quot;holistic medicine&quot;, &quot;natural medicine&quot;, &quot;unorthodox medicine&quot;, &quot;fringe medicine&quot;, &quot;unconventional medicine&quot; and &quot;New Age medicine&quot; are used interchangeably and are almost synonymous. Terminology shifts over time to reflect the branding of practitioners. Therapies are often framed as &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;holistic&quot;, implicitly and intentionally suggesting that conventional medicine is &quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;narrow in scope&quot;.
*Animal magnetism – also known as mesmerism; was the name given by German doctor Franz Mesmer in the 18th century to what he believed to be an invisible natural force (&quot;Lebensmagnetismus&quot;) possessed by all living things, including humans, animals and vegetables. He believed that the force could have physical effects, including healing, and he tried persistently but without success to achieve scientific recognition of his ideas.
* Anthroposophic medicine, or anthroposophical medicine, is a form of alternative medicine. Devised in the 1920s by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman, it was based on occult notions and drew on Steiner&#x27;s spiritual philosophy, which he called anthroposophy. Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts. Many drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra-diluted substances, similar to those used in homeopathy. Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood vaccination and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease. Professor of complementary medicine Edzard Ernst and other critics have characterized anthroposophic medicine as having no basis in science, pseudoscientific and quackery.
* Apitherapy is a branch of alternative medicine that uses honey bee products, including honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom. Proponents of apitherapy make claims for its health benefits, which remain unsupported by evidence-based medicine.
* Applied kinesiology (AK) is a technique in alternative medicine claimed to be able to diagnose illness or choose treatment by testing muscles for strength and weakness. According to their guidelines on allergy diagnostic testing, the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology stated there is &quot;no evidence of diagnostic validity&quot; of applied kinesiology. Another study has shown that as an evaluative method, AK &quot;is no more useful than random guessing&quot; and the American Cancer Society has said that &quot;scientific evidence does not support the claim that applied kinesiology can diagnose or treat cancer or other illness&quot;.
* Aromatherapy uses aromatic materials, including essential oils, and other aroma compounds, with claims for improving psychological or physical well-being. It is offered as a complementary therapy or as a form of alternative medicine, the first meaning alongside standard treatments, the second instead of conventional, evidence-based treatments. Aromatherapists, people who specialize in the practice of aromatherapy, utilize blends of supposedly therapeutic essential oils that can be used as topical application, massage, inhalation or water immersion. There is no good medical evidence that aromatherapy can either prevent, treat, or cure any disease. Placebo-controlled trials are difficult to design, as the point of aromatherapy is the smell of the products. There is disputed evidence that it may be effective in combating postoperative nausea and vomiting.
* Auriculotherapy (also auricular therapy, ear acupuncture, and auriculoacupuncture) is a form of alternative medicine based on the idea that the ear is a micro-system which reflects the entire body, represented on the auricle, the outer portion of the ear. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient are assumed to be treatable by stimulation of the surface of the ear exclusively. Similar mappings are used in many areas of the body, including the practices of reflexology and iridology. These mappings are not based on or supported by any medical or scientific evidence and are therefore considered to be pseudoscience.
* Autistic enterocolitis – is the name of a nonexistent medical condition proposed by discredited British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield when he suggested a link between a number of common clinical symptoms and signs which he contended were distinctive to autism. The existence of such an enterocolitis has been dismissed by experts as having &quot;not been established&quot;. Wakefield&#x27;s now-retracted and fraudulent report used inadequate controls and suppressed negative findings and multiple attempts to replicate his results have been unsuccessful. Reviews in the medical literature have found no link between autism and bowel disease.
* Ayurveda – traditional Ayurveda is a 5,000-year-old alternative medical practice with roots in ancient India based on a mind-body set of beliefs. Imbalance or stress in an individual&#x27;s consciousness is believed to be the cause of diseases. Patients are classified by body types (three &quot;doshas&quot;, which are considered to control mind-body harmony, determine an individual&#x27;s &quot;body type&quot;) and treatment is aimed at restoring balance to the mind-body system. It has long been the main traditional system of health care in India and it has become institutionalized in India&#x27;s colleges and schools, although unlicensed practitioners are common. As with other traditional knowledge, much of it was lost; in the West, current practice is in part based on the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1980s, who mixed it with Transcendental Meditation; other forms of Ayurveda exist as well. The most notable advocate of Ayurveda in America is Deepak Chopra, who claims that the Maharishi&#x27;s Ayurveda is based on quantum mysticism.
* Balneotherapy ( &quot;bath&quot;) is the presumed benefit from disease by bathing, a traditional medicine technique usually practiced at spas. Balneotherapy may involve hot or cold water, massage through moving water, relaxation, or stimulation. Many mineral waters at spas are rich in particular minerals such as silica, sulfur, selenium and radium. Scientific studies into the effectiveness of balneotherapy do not show that balneotherapy is effective for treating rheumatoid arthritis. There is also no evidence indicating a more effective type of bath, or to indicate that bathing is more effective than physical exercise, relaxation therapy, or mudpacks. Most of the studies on balneotherapy have methodological flaws and are not reliable. A 2009 review of all published clinical evidence concluded that existing research is not sufficiently strong to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of balneotherapy.
* Bates method – an alternative therapy aimed at improving eyesight. Eye-care physician William Horatio Bates (1860–1931) attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual &quot;strain&quot; of the eyes and thus felt that relieving such &quot;strain&quot; would cure the problems. In 1952, optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates, &quot;Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists.&quot;
* Biological terrain assessment – a set of computerized tests used to measure the pH, resistivity and redox of a person&#x27;s urine, blood and saliva, with the intention of recommending a customized program of health supplements and remedies (such as vitamins, homeopathic supplements, or herbal medicines) based on the results. Proponents suggest that BTA allows for a correction of biological imbalances before they become pathological, while opponents claim that the tests are imprecise and result in incorrect diagnoses.
* Biorhythm theory – an attempt to predict various aspects of a person&#x27;s life through simple mathematical cycles. The theory was developed by Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century and was popularized in the United States in the late 1970s. It was described as pseudoscience.
* Body memory (BM) is a hypothesis that the body itself is capable of storing memories, as opposed to only the brain. While experiments have demonstrated the possibility of cellular memory there are currently no known means by which tissues other than the brain would be capable of storing memories. Modern usage of BM tends to frame it exclusively in the context of traumatic memory and ways in which the body responds to recall of a memory. In this regard, it has become relevant in treatment for PTSD.
* Brain Gym – is an organization promoting a series of exercises claimed to improve academic performance. Twenty-six Brain Gym activities are claimed to improve eye teaming (binocular vision), spatial and listening skills, hand–eye coordination and whole-body flexibility and by doing this manipulate the brain, improving learning and recall of information. The Brain Gym program calls for children to repeat certain simple movements such as crawling, yawning, making symbols in the air and drinking water; these are intended to &quot;integrate&quot;, &quot;repattern&quot;, and increase blood flow to the brain. Though the organization claims the methods are grounded in good neuroscience, the underlying ideas are pseudoscience.
* Candida hypersensitivity – It has been spuriously claimed that chronic yeast infections are responsible for many common disorders and non-specific symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, asthma and others. The notion has been strongly challenged by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.
* Carnivore dieta fad diet in which nothing is eaten but meat. As well as being unhealthy the diet has a damaging environmental impact.
* Chelation therapy is claimed by some practitioners of alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments, including heart disease and autism. While chelation is a valid form of medical treatment, used as a means to treat conditions such as acute heavy metal toxicity, the use of chelation therapy by alternative medicine practitioners for behavioral and other disorders is considered pseudoscientific; there is no proof that it is effective. In addition to being ineffective, chelation therapy prior to heavy metal testing can artificially raise urinary heavy metal concentrations (&quot;provoked&quot; urine testing) and lead to inappropriate and unnecessary treatment. The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology warn the public that chelating agents used in chelation therapy may have serious side effects, including liver and kidney damage, blood pressure changes, allergies and, in some cases, even death of the patient.
* Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine mostly concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. Some proponents, especially those in the field&#x27;s early history, have claimed that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system, through vertebral subluxation, claims which are not based on scientific evidence. The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy, especially spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), manipulations of other joints and soft tissues. Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine and chiropractic is sustained by pseudoscientific ideas, such as vertebral subluxation and &quot;innate intelligence&quot; that reject science.
* Chromotherapy, sometimes called color therapy, colorology or cromatherapy, is an alternative medicine method which is considered pseudoscience. Chromotherapists claim to be able to use light in the form of color to balance &quot;energy&quot; lacking from a person&#x27;s body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels. Color therapy is distinct from other types of light therapy, such as neonatal jaundice treatment and blood irradiation therapy, which is a scientifically accepted medical treatment for a number of conditions, and from photobiology, the scientific study of the effects of light on living organisms. French skeptic and lighting physicist Sébastien Point considers LED lamps at domestic radiance to be safe in normal use for the general population; he also pointed out the risk of overexposure to light from LEDs for practices like chromotherapy, when duration and time exposure are not under control.
* Chronic Lyme disease (not to be confused with Lyme disease) is a generally rejected diagnosis that encompasses &quot;a broad array of illnesses or symptom complexes for which there is no reproducible or convincing scientific evidence of any relationship to &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; infection.&quot; Despite numerous studies, there is no clinical evidence that &quot;chronic&quot; Lyme disease is caused by a persistent infection. It is distinct from post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, a set of lingering symptoms which may persist after successful treatment of infection with Lyme spirochetes. The symptoms of &quot;chronic Lyme&quot; are generic and non-specific &quot;symptoms of life&quot;.
* Colon cleansing (a.k.a. colon therapy) encompasses a number of alternative medical therapies claimed to remove nonspecific toxins from the colon and intestinal tract by removing any accumulations of feces. Colon cleansing may be branded colon hydrotherapy, a colonic or colonic irrigation. During the 2000s, internet marketing and infomercials of oral supplements supposedly for colon cleansing increased. Some forms of colon Hydrotherapy use tubes to inject water, sometimes mixed with herbs or with other liquids, into the colon via the rectum using special equipment. Oral cleaning regimens use dietary fiber, herbs, dietary supplements, or laxatives. People who practice colon cleansing believe that accumulations of putrefied feces line the walls of the large intestine and that these accumulations harbor parasites or pathogenic gut flora, causing nonspecific symptoms and general ill-health. This &quot;auto-intoxication&quot; hypothesis is based on medical beliefs of the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks and was discredited in the early 20th century.
* Colloidal silver (a colloid consisting of silver particles suspended in liquid) and formulations containing silver salts were used by physicians in the early 20th century, but their use was largely discontinued in the 1940s following the development of safer and effective modern antibiotics. Since about 1990, there has been a resurgence of the promotion of colloidal silver as a dietary supplement, marketed with claims of it being an essential mineral supplement, or that it can prevent or treat numerous diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, HIV/AIDS, herpes and tuberculosis. No medical evidence supports the effectiveness of colloidal silver for any of these claimed indications. Silver is not an essential mineral in humans; there is no dietary requirement for silver and hence, no such thing as a silver &quot;deficiency&quot;. There is no evidence that colloidal silver treats or prevents any medical condition and it can cause serious and potentially irreversible side effects, such as argyria.
* COVID-19 misinformation – multiple theories proposing a wide variety of different things regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 itself and COVID-19 vaccines.
**The Great Barrington Declaration – a document that emerged from the American Institute for Economic Research during the COVID-19 pandemic, authored by three scientists. It promised a way to allow people to carry on their normal lives while invoking the impossible idea of &quot;focused protection&quot; for vulnerable people. The epidemiologist Michael Osterholm called it &quot;a dangerous mix of pixie dust and pseudoscience&quot;.
* Craniosacral therapy – is a form of bodywork or alternative therapy using gentle touch to manipulate the synarthrodial joints of the cranium. A practitioner of craniosacral therapy may also apply light touches to a patient&#x27;s spine and pelvis. Practitioners believe that this manipulation regulates the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and aids in &quot;primary respiration.&quot; Craniosacral therapy was developed by John Upledger, D.O. in the 1970s as an offshoot of osteopathy in the cranial field, or cranial osteopathy, which was developed in the 1930s by William Garner Sutherland. According to the American Cancer Society, although CST may relieve the symptoms of stress or tension, &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that craniosacral therapy helps in treating cancer or any other disease.&quot; CST has been characterized as pseudoscience and its practice has been called quackery. Cranial osteopathy has received a similar assessment, with one 1990 paper finding there was no scientific basis for any of the practitioners&#x27; claims the paper examined.
* Cryonics – a field of products, techniques, and beliefs supporting the idea that freezing the clinically dead at very low temperatures (typically below −196 degrees Celsius) will enable future revival or re-substantiation. These beliefs often hinge on the existence of advanced human societies in the distant future that will possess as-of-yet unknown technology for the stabilization of dying cells. There is no evidence a human being can be revived after such freezing and no solid scientific evidence suggests that reanimation will be possible in the future.
* Crystal healing – belief that crystals have healing properties. Once common among pre-scientific and indigenous peoples, it enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the 1970s with the New Age movement. There is no scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect.
* Cupping therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine. Cupping is used in more than 60 countries. Its usage dates back to as far as 1550 B.C. There are different forms of cupping; the most common are dry, wet and fire cupping. Cups are applied onto the skin and a suction is created, pulling the skin up. It is meant to increase blood flow to certain areas of the body. Not a part of medical practice in the modern era, cupping has been characterized as a pseudoscience. There is no good evidence it has any health benefits and there are some risks of harm, especially in case of wet and fire cupping.
* Detoxification – Detoxification in the context of alternative medicine consists of an approach that claims to rid the body of &quot;toxins&quot; – accumulated substances that allegedly exert undesirable effects on individual health in the short or long term. The concept has received criticism from scientists and health organizations for its unsound scientific basis and lack of evidence for the claims made. The &quot;toxins&quot; usually remain undefined, with little to no evidence of toxic accumulation in the patient. The British organisation Sense about Science has described some detox diets and commercial products as &quot;a waste of time and money&quot;, while the British Dietetic Association called the idea &quot;nonsense&quot; and a &quot;marketing myth&quot;. In the human body, the processing of chemicals, including those considered &#x27;toxins&#x27;, is handled by a number of organs, most prominently the liver and kidneys, thus making detoxes unnecessary.
* Digit ratio – calculated by dividing the length of an index finger by the ring finger of the same hand, has been proposed to correlate with various personality, sexuality, biological, psychological and physical traits/outcomes. The field has been compared to pseudoscience due to irreproducible or contradictory findings, exaggerated claims of usefulness and lack of high quality research protocols.
* Ear candling, also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is a pseudoscientific alternative medicine practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow candle and placing the other end in the ear canal. Medical research has shown that the practice is both dangerous and ineffective and does not functionally remove earwax or toxicants, despite product design contributing to that impression.

* Earthing therapy or grounding is a therapy that is claimed to ease pain, provide a better night&#x27;s sleep, and assist with symptoms of inflammation by being in direct physical contact with the ground or a device connected to electrical ground. Practitioners claim that Earth has an excess of electrons which people are missing due to insulating shoes and ground cover. Being in electrical contact with Earth is claimed to provide the body with those excess electrons, which then act as antioxidants. A 2012 systematic review study showed inconclusive results related to methodological issues across the literature. Subsequently, a 2017 systematic review of the benefits of spending time in forests demonstrated positive health effects, but not enough to generate clinical practice guidelines or demonstrate causality.
* Electrohomeopathy (or Mattei cancer cure) is a derivative of homeopathy invented in the 19th century by Count Cesare Mattei. The name is derived from a combination of &quot;electro&quot; (referring to an electric bio-energy content supposedly extracted from plants and of therapeutic value, rather than electricity in its conventional sense) and &quot;homeopathy&quot; (referring to an alternative medicinal philosophy developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the 18th century). Electrohomeopathy has been defined as the combination of electrical devices and homeopathy.
* Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) – reported sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields or electromagnetic radiation of various frequencies at exposure levels well below established safety standards. Symptoms are inconsistent, but can include headache, fatigue, difficulty sleeping and similar non-specific indications. Provocation studies find that the discomfort of sufferers is unrelated to hidden sources of radiation and &quot;no scientific basis currently exists for a connection between EHS and exposure to [electromagnetic fields].&quot;
* Energy medicine, energy therapy, energy healing, vibrational medicine, psychic healing, spiritual medicine, or spiritual healing are branches of alternative medicine based on a pseudoscientific belief that healers can channel healing energy into a patient and effect positive results. This idea itself contains several methods: hands-on, hands-off and distant (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations. While early reviews of the scientific literature on energy healing were equivocal and recommended further research, more recent reviews have concluded that there is no evidence supporting clinical efficiency.
* Facilitated communication is a scientifically discredited technique that attempts to aid communication by people with autism or other communication disabilities. The facilitator holds the disabled person&#x27;s arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move to type on a keyboard or other device. Research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through FC (involving ideomotor effect guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganz/Katsiyannis/Morin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have consistently found that FC is unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object).
** Rapid prompting method - a closely related discredited technique.
* Fad diet - a diet that becomes popular for a short time, similar to fads in fashion, without being a standard dietary recommendation, and often making pseudoscientific or unreasonable claims for fast weight loss or health improvements. Fad diets are generally restrictive (such as low-calorie diets e.g. fasting, or high protein-low carbohydrate diets e.g. Atkins diet), and are characterized by promises of fast weight loss or great physical health (such as &quot;detoxification&quot; or diets purporting to be alternative cancer treatments). Fad diets are not supported by clinical research and their health recommendations are not peer-reviewed, thus they often make unsubstantiated statements about health and disease.
* Faith healing – act of curing disease by such means as prayer and laying on of hands. There is no material benefit observed in excess of that expected by the placebo effect.
* Functional medicine is a form of alternative medicine that encompasses a number of unproven and disproven methods and treatments. Its proponents claim that it focuses on the &quot;root causes&quot; of diseases based on interactions between the environment and the gastrointestinal, endocrine and immune systems to develop &quot;individualized treatment plans&quot;. Opponents have described it as pseudoscience, quackery and, at its essence, a re-branding of complementary and alternative medicine.
* Germanic New Medicine – Sometime after his son&#x27;s death in 1978 Ryke Geerd Hamer developed testicular cancer; believing there was a link between the two events Hamer developed &quot;Germanic New Medicine&quot; (GNM). According to GNM no real diseases exist; rather, what established medicine calls a &quot;disease&quot; is actually a &quot;special meaningful program of nature&quot; () to which bacteria, viruses and fungi belong. Hamer&#x27;s GNM claims to explain every disease and treatment according to those premises and to thereby obviate traditional medicine. The cure is always the resolving of the conflict. Some treatments like chemotherapy or pain relieving drugs like morphine are deadly, according to Hamer. These &quot;laws&quot; are dogmas of GNM, not laws of nature or medicine, and are at odds with scientific understanding of human physiology.
* Germ theory denialism – the pseudoscientific belief that germs do not cause infectious disease and that the germ theory of disease is wrong.
* Hair analysis is, in mainstream scientific usage, the chemical analysis of a hair sample. The use of hair analysis in alternative medicine as a method of investigation to assist alternative diagnosis is controversial and its use in this manner has been opposed repeatedly by the AMA because of its unproven status and its potential for health care fraud.
* Health bracelets and various healing jewelry such as ionized bracelets, hologram bracelets and magnetic jewelry, are purported to improve the health, heal, or improve the chi of the wearer. No claims of effectiveness made by manufacturers have ever been substantiated by independent sources.
* Hexagonal water – A term used in a marketing scam that claims the ability to create a certain configuration of water that is better for the body. The term &quot;hexagonal water&quot; refers to a cluster of water molecules forming a hexagonal shape that supposedly enhances nutrient absorption, removes metabolic wastes and enhances cellular communication, among other things. Similar to the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, the scam takes advantage of the consumer&#x27;s limited knowledge of chemistry, physics and physiology.
* Homeopathy – the belief that a patient with symptoms of an illness can be treated with extremely dilute remedies that are thought to produce those same symptoms in healthy people. These preparations are often diluted beyond the point where any treatment molecule is likely to remain. Studies of homeopathic practice have been largely negative or inconclusive. No scientific basis for homeopathic principles has been substantiated.
:*Bach flower remedies (BFRs) are solutions of brandy and water—the water containing extreme dilutions of flower material developed by Edward Bach, an English homeopath, in the 1930s. Bach claimed that dew found on flower petals retain imagined healing properties of that plant. Systematic reviews of clinical trials of Bach flower solutions have found no efficacy beyond a placebo effect.
* Iridology – means of medical diagnosis which proponents believe can identify and diagnose health problems through close examination of the markings and patterns of the iris. Practitioners divide the iris into 80–90 zones, each of which is connected to a particular body region or organ. This connection has not been scientifically validated and disorder detection is neither selective nor specific. Because iris texture is a phenotypical feature which develops during gestation and remains unchanged after birth (which makes the iris useful for Biometrics), iridology is all but impossible.
* Jilly Juice – a potentially dangerous fermented drink that has been claimed to treat a variety of medical conditions.
* Leaky gut syndrome – in alternative medicine, a proposed condition caused by the passage of harmful substances outward through the gut wall. It has been proposed as the cause of many conditions, including multiple sclerosis and autism, a claim which has been called pseudoscientific. According to the UK National Health Service, the theory is vague and unproven. Some skeptics and scientists say that the marketing of treatments for leaky gut syndrome is either misguided or an instance of deliberate health fraud.
* Lightning Process – a system claimed to be derived from osteopathy, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) and life coaching. Proponents claim that the Process can have a positive effect on a long list of diseases and conditions, including myalgic encephalomyelitis, despite no scientific evidence of efficacy. The designer of the Lightning Process, Phil Parker, suggests certain illnesses such as ME/CFS arise from a dysregulation of the central nervous system and autonomic nervous system, which the Lightning Process aims to address, helping to break the &quot;adrenaline loop&quot; that keeps the systems&#x27; stress responses high.
* Macrobiotic diets (or macrobiotics) are fixed on ideas about types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism. The diet attempts to balance the supposed yin and yang elements of food and cookware. Major principles of macrobiotic diets are to reduce animal products, eat locally grown foods that are in season and consume meals in moderation. Macrobiotics writers often claim that a macrobiotic diet is helpful for people with cancer and other chronic diseases, although there is no good evidence to support such recommendations and the diet can be harmful. Studies that indicate positive results are of poor methodological quality. Neither the American Cancer Society nor Cancer Research UK recommend adopting the diet.
* Magnet therapy – practice of using magnetic fields to positively influence health. While there are legitimate medical uses for magnets and magnetic fields, the field strength used in magnetic therapy is too low to effect any biological change and the methods used have no scientific validity.
:* The above is not to be confused with current health treatments involving electromagnetism on human tissue, such as pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (see: Electromagnetic therapy).
* A medical intuitive is an alternative medicine practitioner who claims to use their self-described intuitive abilities to find the cause of a physical or emotional condition through the use of insight rather than modern medicine. Other terms for such a person include medical clairvoyant, medical psychic, or intuitive counselor. In 2009, Steven Novella, writing on Science Based Medicine, calls medical intuitive diagnosis as &quot;purely magical thinking&quot; and refers to a &quot;Huffington Post&quot; article about it as &quot;a promotion of a dubious pseudoscientific medical claim&quot;.
* Morgellons – is the informal name of a self-diagnosed, unexplained skin condition in which individuals have sores that they believe contain some kind of fibers. Morgellons is poorly characterized, but the general medical consensus is that it is a form of delusional parasitosis. An attempt to link Morgellons to the cause of Lyme disease has been attacked by Steven Salzberg as &quot;dangerous pseudoscience&quot;.
* Moxibustion – application on or above the skin of smoldering mugwort, or &quot;moxa&quot;, to stimulate &quot;acupuncture points&quot;. A Cochrane Review found moderate certainty evidence for the use of moxibustion plus usual care in correcting breech presentation of babies but uncertainty about the need for External cephalic version. Moxibustion has also been studied for the treatment of pain, cancer, stroke, ulcerative colitis constipation, and hypertension. Systematic reviews have found that these studies are of low quality and positive findings could be due to publication bias.
* Nambudripad&#x27;s Allergy Elimination Techniques (NAET) are a form of alternative medicine which proponents claim can treat allergies and related disorders. The techniques were devised by Devi Nambudripad, a California-based chiropractor and acupuncturist, in 1983, drawing on a combination of ideas from applied kinesiology, acupuncture, acupressure, nutritional management and chiropractic methods. There is no credible evidence to support its effectiveness in assessing or treating allergies.
* Naturopathy, or naturopathic medicine, is a type of alternative medicine based on a belief in vitalism, which posits that a special energy called vital energy or vital force guides bodily processes such as metabolism, reproduction, growth and adaptation. Naturopathy has been characterized as pseudoscience. It has particularly been criticized for its unproven, disproven, or dangerous treatments. &quot;Natural&quot; methods and chemicals are not necessarily safer or more effective than &quot;artificial&quot; or &quot;synthetic&quot; ones; any treatment capable of eliciting an effect may also have deleterious side effects.
* Negative air ionization therapy is the use of air ionizers as an experimental non-pharmaceutical treatment. It is widely considered pseudoscience.
* Oil pulling – is a folk remedy where oil is &quot;swished&quot; or &quot;held&quot; in the mouth for up to 20 minutes with the goal of improving oral as well as systemic health. It is said that this technique &quot;pulls out&quot; toxins from the body and is claimed to be able to treat a plethora of conditions from migraines to diabetes.
* Orthomolecular medicine, sometimes referred to as megavitamin therapy, is a form of alternative medicine that aims to maintain human health through nutritional supplementation. The concept builds on the idea of an optimum nutritional environment in the body and suggests that diseases reflect deficiencies in this environment. Treatment for disease, according to this view, involves attempts to correct &quot;imbalances or deficiencies based on individual biochemistry&quot; by use of substances such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, trace elements and fatty acids. The notions behind orthomolecular medicine are not supported by sound medical evidence and the therapy is not effective; even the validity of calling the orthomolecular approach a form of medicine has been questioned since the 1970s.
* Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) or osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) – the core technique of osteopathic medicine. OMM is based on a philosophy devised by Andrew Taylor Still (1828–1917), who held that the body had self-regulating mechanisms that could be harnessed through manipulating the bones, tendons and muscles. It has been proposed as a treatment for a number of human ailments, including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, pancreatitis and pneumonia, but has only been found to be effective for lower back pain by virtue of the spinal manipulation used. It has long been regarded as rooted in &quot;pseudoscientific dogma&quot;. In 2010, Steven Salzberg referred to the OMT-specific training given by colleges of osteopathic medicine as &quot;training in pseudoscientific practices&quot;.
* Pulse diagnosis is a diagnostic technique used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Mongolian medicine, Siddha medicine, traditional Tibetan medicine and Unani. It has no scientific legitimacy, and is ill-defined, subjective and unreliable.
* Radionics – means of medical diagnosis and therapy which proponents believe can diagnose and remedy health problems using various frequencies in a putative energy field coupled to the practitioner&#x27;s electronic device. The first such &quot;black box&quot; devices were designed and promoted by Albert Abrams and were definitively proven useless by an independent investigation commissioned by &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1924. The internal circuitry of radionics devices is often obfuscated and irrelevant, leading proponents to conjecture dowsing and ESP as operating principles. Similar devices continue to be marketed under various names, though none is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; there is no scientific evidence for the efficacy or underlying premise of radionics devices. The radionics of Albert Abrams and his intellectual descendants should not be confused with similarly named reputable and legitimate companies, products, or medical treatments such as radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation.
* Reiki is a form of alternative medicine called energy healing. Reiki practitioners use a technique called &quot;palm healing&quot; or &quot;hands-on healing&quot; through which a &quot;universal energy&quot; is said to be transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing. Reiki is a pseudoscience, and is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly texts and academic journal articles. It is based on &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;chi&quot;), which practitioners say is a universal life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists. Clinical research has not shown reiki to be effective as a treatment for any medical condition. There has been no proof of the effectiveness of reiki therapy compared to the placebo effect. An overview of reiki investigations found that studies reporting positive effects had methodological flaws. The American Cancer Society stated that reiki should not replace conventional cancer treatment, a sentiment echoed by Cancer Research UK and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Developed in Japan in 1922 by Mikao Usui, it has been adapted into varying cultural traditions across the world.
* Reflexology, or zone therapy, is an alternative medicine involving the physical act of applying pressure to the feet, hands, or ears with specific thumb, finger and hand techniques without the use of oil or lotion. It is based on what reflexologists claim to be a system of zones and reflex areas that they say reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work effects a physical change to the body. A 2009 systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that the best evidence available to date does not demonstrate convincingly that reflexology is an effective treatment for any medical condition. There is no consensus among reflexologists on how reflexology is supposed to work; a unifying theme is the idea that areas on the foot correspond to areas of the body and that, by manipulating these, one can improve health through one&#x27;s &quot;qi&quot;. Reflexologists divide the body into 10 equal vertical zones, five on the right and five on the left. Concerns have been raised by medical professionals that treating potentially serious illnesses with reflexology, which has no proven efficacy, could delay the seeking of appropriate medical treatment.
* Rolfing (also called Structural Integration) – body manipulation devised by Ida Rolf (1896–1979) claimed by practitioners to be capable of ridding the body of traumatic memories stored in the muscles. There is no evidence that rolfing is effective as a treatment for any condition.
* Therapeutic touch – a form of vitalism where a practitioner, who may be also a nurse, passes their hands over and around a patient to &quot;realign&quot; or &quot;rebalance&quot; a putative energy field. A recent Cochrane Review concluded that &quot;[t]here is no evidence that [Therapeutic Touch] promotes healing of acute wounds.&quot; No biophysical basis for such an energy field has been found.
* Tin foil hat – A tin foil hat is a hat made from one or more sheets of aluminium foil, or a piece of conventional headgear lined with foil, worn in the belief it shields the brain from threats such as electromagnetic fields, mind control and mind reading. The usage of a metal foil hat for protection against interference of the mind was mentioned in a science fiction short story by Julian Huxley, &quot;The Tissue-Culture King&quot;, first published in 1926, in which the protagonist discovers that &quot;caps of metal foil&quot; can block the effects of telepathy. At this time, no link has been established between the radio-frequency EMR that tin foil hats are meant to protect against and subsequent ill health.
* Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) – a traditional medical system originating in China and practiced as an alternative medicine throughout much of the world. It contains elements based in the cosmology of Taoism and considers the human body more in functional and vitalistic than anatomical terms. Health and illness in TCM follow the principle of yin and yang and are ascribed to balance or imbalance in the flow of a vital force, &quot;qi&quot;. Diagnostic methods are solely external, including pulse examination at six points, examination of a patient&#x27;s tongue and a patient interview; interpractitioner diagnostic agreement is poor. The TCM description of the function and structure of the human body is fundamentally different from modern medicine.
** TCM &quot;materia medica&quot; – a collection of crude medicines used in traditional Chinese medicine. These include many plants in part or whole, such as ginseng and wolfberry, as well as more exotic ingredients, such as seahorses. Preparations generally include several ingredients in combination, with selection based on physical characteristics such as taste or shape, or relationship to the organs of TCM. Most preparations have not been rigorously evaluated or give no indication of efficacy. Pharmacognosy research for potential active ingredients present in these preparations is active, though the applications do not always correspond to those of TCM.
** Gua sha (), kerokan or coining, is part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Its practitioners use a tool to scrape people&#x27;s skin to cause tissue damage in the belief this has medicinal benefit. Gua sha is sometimes referred to as &quot;scraping&quot;, &quot;spooning&quot; or &quot;coining&quot; by English speakers. Edzard Ernst has written that any apparent benefit from gua sha is due to the placebo effect.
** Meridians are the channels through which &quot;qi&quot; flows, connecting the several &quot;zang-fu&quot; organ pairs. There is no known anatomical or histological basis for the existence of &quot;acupuncture points&quot; or &quot;meridians&quot;.
** Shiatsu () is a form of Japanese bodywork based on ideas in traditional Chinese medicine. &quot;Shiatsu&quot; derives from a Japanese massage modality called &quot;anma&quot;. There is no evidence that &quot;shiatsu&quot; is an effective medical treatment.
** Qi – vital energy whose flow must be balanced for health. &quot;Qi&quot; has never been directly observed and is unrelated to the concept of energy used in science.
** Qigong (), qi gong, chi kung, or chi gung () is a holistic system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing and meditation used for the purposes of health, spirituality and martial arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy and martial arts, qigong is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi (chi), translated as &quot;life energy&quot;. Research concerning qigong has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including hypertension, pain and cancer, and with respect to quality of life. Most research concerning health benefits of qigong has been of poor quality, such that it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage.
** Zang-fu – concept of organs as functional yin and yang entities for the storage and manipulation of &quot;qi&quot;. These organs are not based in anatomy.
* Tomatis Method A type of auditory integration training devised by Alfred A. Tomatis and promoted, without supporting evidence, as being of benefit to people with autism.
* Urine therapy – drinking either one&#x27;s own undiluted urine or homeopathic potions of urine for treatment of a wide variety of diseases is based on pseudoscience.
* Promotion of a link between autism and vaccines, in which the vaccines are accused of causing autism-spectrum conditions, triggering them, or aggravating them, has been characterized as pseudoscience. Many epidemiological studies have reported no association between either the MMR vaccine and autism, or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Consequently, the Institute of Medicine has concluded that there is no causal link between either of these varieties of vaccines and autism. Similarly, &quot;vaccine overload&quot;, a non-medical term describing the notion that giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child&#x27;s immature immune system and lead to adverse effects is strongly contradicted by scientific evidence.
* Vitalism – doctrine that the processes of life are not explicable by the laws of physics and chemistry alone and that life is, in some part, self-determining. The book &quot;Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience&quot; stated &quot;today, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body&#x27;s vital force.&quot; &quot;Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality.&quot;
* Water memory – a homeopathic theory based on the purported ability of water to retain a memory of substances previously dissolved in it.
* Wilson&#x27;s syndrome (not to be confused with Wilson&#x27;s disease) is an alternative medicine concept, not recognized as a legitimate diagnosis in evidence-based medicine. Its supporters describe Wilson&#x27;s syndrome as a mix of common and non-specific symptoms which they attribute to low body temperature and impaired conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), despite normal thyroid function tests. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) says Wilson&#x27;s syndrome is at odds with established knowledge of thyroid function, has vague diagnostic criteria and lacks supporting scientific evidence. The ATA further raised concern that the proposed treatments were potentially harmful.
* Wind turbine syndrome and wind farm syndrome are terms for adverse health effects that have been ascribed to the proximity of wind turbines. Proponents have claimed that these effects include death, cancer and congenital abnormality. The distribution of recorded events, however, correlates with media coverage of wind farm syndrome itself and not with the presence or absence of wind farms. Reviews of the scientific literature have consistently found no reason to believe that wind turbines are harmful to health.

=== Technology ===
* 5G conspiracies and 5G causes coronavirus theories – theory proposing that 5G causes health issues, including COVID-19.

== Social sciences ==

=== History ===

* Christ myth theory – A fringe theory that proposes that the historical Jesus did not exist in any capacity whatsoever. While the divinity of Jesus is disputed, Christian and non-Christian scholars of antiquity universally agree that Jesus of Nazareth was a Galilean Jew who lived in the first century, was baptized, and later crucified by Roman authorities. This is based on sources written by historians, scholars, and politicians who lived during the time of Christ.
* Historical materialism – Karl Popper criticised the Marxist theory of history on the grounds of being unfalsifiable. Specifically, he claimed that while the theory was originally scientific, over time it has been modified and degraded into a non-scientific form. Popper thus viewed Marxism as a pseudoscience. Others who shared a similar view were philosopher Imre Lakatos and sociologist Ernest van den Haag. 
* Holocaust denial – Historical revisionist movements associated with holocaust denial have employed pseudoscientific evidence and conspiracy theories published in intradiegetic pseudo-academic journals and presented at fringe conferences (e.g. misconstruing cyanide residue studies, claiming despite all evidence to the contrary that gas chambers were built after the war).
* Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenzai ancestry – A fringe theory that postulates that Ashkenazi Jews were primarily, or to a large extent, descended from Khazars, a multi-ethnic conglomerate of mostly Turkic peoples who formed a semi-nomadic khanate in and around the northern and central Caucasus and the Pontic–Caspian steppe. Genetic studies on Jews have found no substantive evidence of a Khazar origin among Ashkenazi Jews, with evidence suggesting the Ashkenazi have mixed Near Eastern and Southern European/Mediterranean origins.
* New chronology (Fomenko) – pseudohistorical conspiracy theory which argues that events of antiquity generally attributed to the civilizations of the Roman Empire, Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt, actually occurred during the Middle Ages, more than a thousand years later.

=== Linguistics ===
* Japhetic theory – claim that the Afroasiatic, Basque, and Kartvelian language families share a common origin
* Sun Language Theory – the belief that all languages had their origins in the Turkish language.

=== Psychology ===
* Attachment therapy – common name for a set of potentially fatal clinical interventions and parenting techniques aimed at controlling aggressive, disobedient, or unaffectionate children using &quot;restraint and physical and psychological abuse to seek their desired results.&quot; (The term &quot;attachment therapy&quot; may sometimes be used loosely to refer to mainstream approaches based on attachment theory, usually outside the US where the pseudoscientific form of attachment therapy is less known.) Probably the most common form is holding therapy, in which the child is restrained by adults for the purpose of supposed cathartic release of suppressed rage and regression. Perhaps the most extreme, but much less common, is &quot;rebirthing&quot;, in which the child is wrapped tightly in a blanket and then made to simulate emergence from a birth canal. This is done by encouraging the child to struggle and pushing and squeezing him/her to mimic contractions. Despite the practice&#x27;s name, it is not based on traditional attachment theory and shares no principles of mainstream developmental psychology research. In 2006, it was the subject of an almost entirely critical Taskforce Report commissioned by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC).
* Conversion therapy – sometimes called reparative therapy, seeks to change a non-heterosexual person&#x27;s sexual orientation so they will no longer have same-sex attraction. The American Psychiatric Association defines reparative therapy as &quot;psychiatric treatment ... which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the &quot;a priori&quot; assumption that a patient should change their sexual homosexual orientation.&quot;
* Coding is a catch-all term for various Russian alternative therapeutic methods used to treat addictions, in which the therapist attempts to scare patients into abstinence from a substance they are addicted to by convincing them that they will be harmed or killed if they use it again. Each method involves the therapist pretending to insert a &quot;code&quot; into patients&#x27; brains that will ostensibly provoke a strong adverse reaction should it come into contact with the addictive substance. The methods use a combination of theatrics, hypnosis, placebos, and drugs with temporary adverse effects to instill the erroneous beliefs. Therapists may pretend to &quot;code&quot; patients for a fixed length of time, such as five years.
* Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy in which the person being treated is asked to recall distressing images; the therapist then directs the person in one type of bilateral sensory input, such as side-to-side eye movements or hand tapping. It is included in several guidelines for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some clinical psychologists have argued that the eye movements do not add anything above imagery exposure and characterize its promotion and use as pseudoscience.
* Facilitated communication (FC), or supported typing, is a scientifically discredited technique that attempts to facilitate communication by people with severe educational and communication disabilities. The facilitator holds or gently touches the disabled person&#x27;s arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move to type on a special keyboard. In addition to providing physical support needed for typing or pointing, the facilitator provides verbal prompts and moral support. There is widespread agreement within the scientific community and multiple disability advocacy organizations that FC is not a valid technique for authentically augmenting the communication skills of those with autism spectrum disorder. Instead, research indicates that the facilitator is the source of most or all messages obtained through FC (involving ideomotor effect guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator); thus, studies have consistently found that patients are unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object) . In addition, numerous cases have been reported by investigators in which disabled persons were assumed by facilitators to be typing a coherent message while the patient&#x27;s eyes were closed or while they were looking away from or showing no particular interest in the letter board.
* The Feldenkrais Method is a type of exercise therapy devised by Israeli Moshé Feldenkrais (1904–1984) during the mid-20th century. The method is claimed to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state. There is no good medical evidence that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits. It is not known if it is safe or cost-effective, but researchers do not believe it poses serious risks.
* Graphology – psychological test based on a belief that personality traits or gender unconsciously and consistently influence handwriting morphology—that certain types of people exhibit certain quirks of the pen. Analysis of handwriting attributes provides no better than chance correspondence with personality, and neuroscientist Barry Beyerstein likened the assigned correlations to sympathetic magic. Graphology is only superficially related to forensic document examination, which also examines handwriting.
* Hypnosis – state of extreme relaxation and inner focus in which a person is unusually responsive to suggestions made by the hypnotist. The modern practice has its roots in the idea of animal magnetism, or mesmerism, originated by Franz Mesmer. Mesmer&#x27;s explanations were thoroughly discredited, and to this day there is no agreement amongst researchers whether hypnosis is a real phenomenon, or merely a form of participatory role-enactment. Some aspects of suggestion have been clinically useful. Other claimed uses of hypnosis more clearly fall within the area of pseudoscience. Such areas include the use of hypnotic regression, including past life regression.
* Hypnotherapy – therapy that is undertaken with a subject in hypnosis. Using hypnosis for relaxation, mood control, and other related benefits (often related to meditation) is regarded as part of standard medical treatment rather than alternative medicine, particularly for patients subjected to difficult physical emotional stress in chemotherapy.
* Law of attraction – the maxim that &quot;like attracts like&quot; which, in New Thought philosophy, is used to sum up the idea that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts a person brings positive or negative experiences into their life. &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine criticized the lack of falsifiability and testability of these claims. Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually anecdotal and that, because of the self-selecting nature of the positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias. Physicist Ali Alousi, for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head.
* Memetics – approach to evolutionary models of cultural information transfer based on the concept that units of information, or &quot;memes&quot;, have an independent existence, are self-replicating, and are subject to selective evolution through environmental forces. Starting from a proposition put forward in the writings of Richard Dawkins, it has since turned into a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It has been proposed that just as memes are analogous to genes, memetics is analogous to genetics. Memetics has been deemed a pseudoscience on several fronts. Its proponents&#x27; assertions have been labeled &quot;untested, unsupported or incorrect&quot;. Supporters of memetics include EO Wilson, Douglas Hofstadter and many others.
* Myers–Briggs Type Indicator – a personality test composed of four categories of two types. The test has consistent problems with repeatability, in addition to problems of whether or not it has exhaustive and mutually exclusive classifications. The four categories are Introversion/Extroversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perception. Each person is said to have one quality from each category, producing 16 unique types. The Center for Applications of Psychological Type claims that the MBTI is scientifically supported, but most of the research on it is done through its own journal, &quot;Journal of Psychological Type&quot;, raising questions of bias. Results are said to follow the Barnum effect.
* Neuro-linguistic programming – an approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created in the 1970s. The title refers to a stated connection between the neurological processes (&quot;neuro&quot;), language (&quot;linguistic&quot;) and behavioral patterns that have been learned through experience (&quot;programming&quot;) and can be organized to achieve specific goals in life. According to certain neuroscientists psychologists and linguists, NLP is unsupported by current scientific evidence, and uses incorrect and misleading terms and concepts. Reviews of empirical research on NLP indicate that NLP contains numerous factual errors, and has failed to produce reliable results for the claims for effectiveness made by NLP&#x27;s originators and proponents. According to Devilly, NLP is no longer as prevalent as it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Criticisms go beyond the lack of empirical evidence for effectiveness; critics say that NLP exhibits pseudoscientific characteristics, title, concepts and terminology. NLP is used as an example of pseudoscience for facilitating the teaching of scientific literacy at the professional and university level. NLP also appears on peer-reviewed expert-consensus based lists of discredited interventions. In research designed to identify the &quot;quack factor&quot; in modern mental health practice, Norcross &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) list NLP as possibly or probably discredited, and in papers reviewing discredited interventions for substance and alcohol abuse, Norcross &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) list NLP in the &quot;top ten&quot; most discredited, and Glasner-Edwards and Rawson (2010) list NLP as &quot;certainly discredited&quot;.
* Odic force – hypothetical life force used to explain hypnosis.
* Parapsychology – controversial discipline that seeks to investigate the existence and causes of psychic abilities and life after death using the scientific method. Parapsychological experiments have included the use of random number generators to test for evidence of precognition and psychokinesis with both human and animal subjects and Ganzfeld experiments to test for extrasensory perception.
* Phrenology – now defunct system for determining personality traits by feeling bumps on the skull proposed by 18th-century physiologist Franz Joseph Gall. In an early recorded use of the term &quot;pseudo-science&quot;, François Magendie referred to phrenology as &quot;a pseudo-science of the present day&quot;. The assumption that personality can be read from bumps in the skull has since been thoroughly discredited. However, Gall&#x27;s assumption that character, thoughts, and emotions are located in the brain is considered an important historical advance toward neuropsychology (see also Localization of brain function, Brodmann&#x27;s areas, Neuro-imaging, Modularity of mind or Faculty psychology).
* Polygraph (&quot;lie detection&quot;) – an interrogation method which measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions. The belief is that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. Many members of the scientific community consider polygraphy to be pseudoscience. Polygraphy has little credibility among scientists. Despite claims of 90–95% validity by polygraph advocates, and 95–100% by businesses providing polygraph services, critics maintain that rather than a &quot;test&quot;, the method amounts to an inherently unstandardizable interrogation technique whose accuracy cannot be established. A 1997 survey of 421 psychologists estimated the test&#x27;s average accuracy at about 61%, a little better than chance. Critics also argue that, even given high estimates of the polygraph&#x27;s accuracy, a significant number of subjects (e.g., 10% given a 90% accuracy) will appear to be lying, and would unfairly suffer the consequences of &quot;failing&quot; the polygraph.
* Primal therapy – sometimes presented as a science. &quot;The Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology&quot; (2001) states that: &quot;The theoretical basis for the therapy is the supposition that prenatal experiences and birth trauma form people&#x27;s primary impressions of life and that they subsequently influence the direction our lives take ... Truth be known, primal therapy cannot be defended on scientifically established principles. This is not surprising considering its questionable theoretical rationale.&quot; Other sources have also questioned the scientific validity of primal therapy, some using the term &quot;pseudoscience&quot; (see ).
* Psychoanalysis – body of ideas developed by Austrian physician Sigmund Freud and his followers, which is devoted to the study of human psychological functioning and behavior. Although psychoanalysis is a strong influence within psychiatry, it has been controversial ever since its inception. It is considered pseudoscience by some. Karl Popper characterized it as pseudoscience based on psychoanalysis failing the requirement for falsifiability. Frank Cioffi argued that &quot;though Popper is correct to say that psychoanalysis is pseudoscientific and correct to say that it is unfalsifiable, he is mistaken to suggest that it is pseudoscientific &quot;because&quot; it is unfalsifiable. [...] It is when [Freud] insists that he has confirmed (not just instantiated) [his empirical theses] that he is being pseudoscientific.&quot;
* Sluggish schizophrenia – a diagnosis used in some Communist nations to justify the involuntary commitment of political dissidents to mental institutions.
* Subliminal advertising – visual or auditory information discerned below the threshold of conscious awareness, which is claimed to have a powerful enduring effect on consuming habits. It went into disrepute in the late 1970s, but there has been renewed research interest recently. The mainstream of accepted scientific opinion does not hold that subliminal perception has a powerful, enduring effect on human behaviour.
*Voice stress analysis - junk science technology that is advertised to infer deception from stress measured in the voice, often used in a similar manner to a polygraph examination.

=== Racial theories ===

* Scientific racism – claim that scientific evidence shows the inferiority or superiority of certain races.

:*Aryanism – the claim that there is a distinct &quot;Aryan race&quot; that is superior to other putative races was an important tenet of Nazism and &quot;the basis of the German government policy of exterminating Jews, Gypsies, and other &#x27;non-Aryans.&#x27;&quot;
:* Drapetomania was a conjectural mental illness that, in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized as the cause of enslaved Africans fleeing captivity. It has since been debunked as pseudoscience and part of the edifice of scientific racism.
:* Melanin theory – belief founded in the distortion of known physical properties of melanin, a natural polymer, that posits the inherent superiority of dark-skinned people and the essential inhumanity and inferiority of light-skinned people.
:*Turkish History Thesis – the belief that Turks from Central Asia migrated and brought civilization to China, India, the Middle East, and Europe.
* Eugenics – As a movement, eugenics was associated with pseudoscience including pseudoscientific journals and professional societies.

===Sociology===
* Alpha and beta male – pseudoscientific terms for men derived from alpha and beta animals in ethology. Often used by members of the &quot;manosphere,&quot; these terms have been criticized by scientists and are often considered sexist.
* Strauss–Howe generational theory – claims that history moves through four 20-year &quot;turnings&quot; that repeat sequentially in a fixed pattern approximately every 80 years.
* Unilineal evolution – Before Darwin&#x27;s work &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, some models incorporated Enlightenment ideas of social progress, and thus, according to philosopher of science Michael Ruse, were pseudoscientific by current standards, and may have been viewed as such during the 18th century, as well as into the start of the 19th century (though the word pseudoscience may not have been used in reference to these early proposals). This pseudoscientific, and often political, incorporation of social progress with evolutionary thought continued for some 100 years following the publication of &quot;Origin of Species&quot;.

== Paranormal and ufology ==
Paranormal subjects have been critiqued from a wide range of sources including the following claims of paranormal significance:
* Animal mutilations – cases of animals, primarily domestic livestock, with seemingly inexplicable wounds. These wounds have been said to be caused by extraterrestrials, cults, covert government organizations, or cryptids such as &quot;el chupacabra&quot;, when in fact most such cases were found to be caused by natural predation.
* An aura or human energy field is, according to New Age beliefs, a colored emanation said to enclose a human body or any animal or object. In some esoteric positions, the aura is described as a subtle body. Psychics and holistic medicine practitioners often claim to have the ability to see the size, color and type of vibration of an aura. In New Age alternative medicine, the human aura is seen as a hidden anatomy that affects the health of a client, and is often understood to be composed of centers of vital force called chakra. Such claims are not supported by scientific evidence and are pseudoscience. When tested under controlled experiments, the ability to see auras has not been shown to exist.
* Channeling – communication of information to or through a person allegedly from a spirit or other paranormal entity.
* Crop circles – geometric designs of crushed or knocked-over crops created in a field. Aside from skilled farmers or pranksters working through the night, explanations for their formation include UFOs and anomalous, tornado-like air currents. The study of crop circles has become known as &quot;cerealogy&quot;.
* Cryptozoology – search for creatures that are considered not to exist by most biologists. Well-known examples of creatures of interest to cryptozoologists include Bigfoot, the Yeren, the Yeti, and the Loch Ness Monster. According to leading skeptical authors Michael Shermer and Pat Linse, &quot;Cryptozoology ranges from pseudoscientific to useful and interesting, depending on how it is practiced.&quot;
* Dowsing refers to practices said to enable one to detect hidden water, metals, gemstones or other objects.
* Electronic voice phenomenon – purported communication by spirits through tape recorders and other electronic devices.
* Extra-sensory perception – paranormal ability (independent of the five main senses or deduction from previous experience) to acquire information by means such as telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychometry, psychic abilities, and remote viewing.
* Ghost hunting is the process of investigating locations that are reported to be haunted by ghosts. Typically, a ghost-hunting team will attempt to collect evidence supporting the existence of paranormal activity. Ghost hunters use a variety of electronic devices, including EMF meters, digital thermometers, both handheld and static digital video cameras, including thermographic and night vision cameras, as well as digital audio recorders. Other more traditional techniques are also used, such as conducting interviews and researching the history of allegedly haunted sites. Ghost hunters may also refer to themselves as &quot;paranormal investigators.&quot; Ghost hunting has been heavily criticized for its dismissal of the scientific method. No scientific study has ever been able to confirm the existence of ghosts. The practice is considered a pseudoscience by the vast majority of educators, academics, science writers, and skeptics. Science historian Brian Regal described ghost hunting as &quot;an unorganized exercise in futility&quot;.
* Lizard people – The idea of a reptilian reconquest was popularized by David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens control Earth by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate human societies. Icke has stated on multiple occasions that many world leaders are, or are possessed by, so-called reptilians.
* Levitation – act of rising up from the ground without any physical aids, usually by the power of thought.
* Palmistry – the belief that the future can be foretold through palm reading. Predictions are based on the shape, line, and mounts of the hands. Palmists use cold reading in order to appear psychic.
* Parapsychology – (see Psychology section above)
* Pseudoarchaeology – investigation of the ancient past using alleged paranormal or other means which have not been validated by mainstream science.
* Psychic surgery – a type of medical fraud, popular in Brazil and the Philippines. Practitioners use sleight of hand to make it appear as though they are reaching into a patient&#x27;s body and extracting &quot;tumors&quot;. Psychic surgery is usually explicit deception; i.e., the &quot;practitioners&quot; are &quot;aware&quot; that they are practicing fraud or &quot;quackery&quot;.
* Psychokinesis – paranormal ability of the mind to influence matter or energy at a distance.
* Séances – ritualized attempts to communicate with the dead.
* The Tunguska event was an actual large explosion, possibly caused by a meteoroid or comet, in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia in June 1908. Night skies as far away as London were markedly brighter for several evenings. Unsupported theories regarding the event include the impact of a miniature black hole or large body of antimatter, ball lightning, a test by Nikola Tesla of the apparatus at Wardenclyffe Tower, and a UFO crash. Another theory, not in itself pseudoscientific, is that the explosion was caused by a piece of Biela&#x27;s Comet from 1883.
* Ufology – the study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that sometimes includes the belief that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial visitors.

== Numerology ==
* Numerology (including the numerology practices of Kabbalah) – a set of beliefs in a divine, mystical, or other special relationship between a number and coinciding events. Numerology is regarded as pseudomathematics or pseudoscience by modern scientists. It is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar divinatory arts.
* Scriptural codes – the belief that a book or fragment of holy scripture contains encoded messages that impart esoteric knowledge. One such decoding method involves identifying &quot;equidistant letter sequences&quot; that spell out such messages.

== Religious and spiritual beliefs ==
Spiritual and religious practices and beliefs, according to astronomer Carl Sagan, are normally not classified as pseudoscience. However, religion can sometimes nurture pseudoscience, and &quot;at the extremes it is difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from rigid, doctrinaire religion&quot;, and some religions might be confused with pseudoscience, such as traditional meditation. The following religious/spiritual items have been related to or classified as pseudoscience in some way:
* Affirmative prayer is a form of prayer or a metaphysical technique that is focused on a positive outcome, rather than a negative situation. For instance, a person who is experiencing some form of illness would focus the prayer on the desired state of perfect health and affirm this desired intention &quot;as if already happened&quot; rather than identifying the illness and then asking God for help to eliminate it. William James described affirmative prayer as an element of the American metaphysical healing movement that he called the &quot;mind-cure&quot;; he described it as the United States&#x27; &quot;only decidedly original contribution to the systemic philosophy of life.&quot; What sets affirmative prayer apart from secular affirmations of the autosuggestion type taught by the 19th century self-help author Émile Coué (whose most famous affirmation was &quot;Every day in every way, I am getting better and better&quot;) is that affirmative prayer addresses the practitioner to God, the Divine, the Creative Mind, emphasizing the seemingly practical aspects of religious belief.
* Christian Science is generally considered a Christian new religious movement; however, some have called it &quot;pseudoscience&quot; because its founder, Mary Baker Eddy, used &quot;science&quot; in its name, and because of its former stance against medical science. Also, &quot;Eddy used the term Metaphysical science to distinguish her system both from materialistic science and from occult science.&quot; The church now accepts the use of medical science. Vaccinations were banned, but in 1901, Eddy, at the age of 80, advised her followers to submit to them.
* Energy is used by writers and practitioners of various esoteric forms of spirituality and alternative medicine to refer to a variety of claimed experiences and phenomena that defy measurement and thus can be distinguished from the scientific form of energy. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of such energy. Therapies that purport to use, modify, or manipulate unknown energies are thus among the most contentious of all complementary and alternative medicines. Claims related to energy therapies are most often anecdotal (from single stories), rather than being based on repeatable empirical evidence.
* Exorcism (from Greek ἐξορκισμός, &quot;exorkismós&quot; &quot;binding by oath&quot;) is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, that is believed to be possessed. Depending on the spiritual beliefs of the exorcist, this may be done by causing the entity to swear an oath, performing an elaborate ritual, or simply by commanding it to depart in the name of a higher power. The practice is ancient and part of the belief system of many cultures and religions. Requested and performed exorcism began to decline in the United States by the 18th century and occurred rarely until the latter half of the 20th century, when the public saw a sharp rise due to the media attention exorcisms were getting. There was &quot;a 50% increase in the number of exorcisms performed between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s&quot;.
* Koranic scientific foreknowledge (or Qur&#x27;anic science or Hadeeth science) asserts that foundational Islamic religious texts made accurate statements about the world that science verified hundreds of years later. This belief is a common theme in Bucailleism. According to Turkish American physicist Taner Edis, many Muslims appreciate technology and respect the role that science plays in its creation. As a result, he says there is a great deal of Islamic pseudoscience attempting to reconcile science with their religious beliefs. Edis maintains that the motivation to read modern scientific truths into holy books is also stronger for Muslims than Christians. This is because, according to Edis, true criticism of the Quran is almost non-existent in the Muslim world, causing Muslims to believe that scientific truths simply must appear in the Quran.

=== Creation science ===
Creation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts, theories and scientific paradigms about geology, cosmology, biological evolution, archaeology, history and linguistics.
* Baraminology – taxonomic system that classifies animals into groups called &quot;created kinds&quot; or &quot;baramins&quot; according to the account of creation in the book of Genesis and other parts of the Bible.
* Creation biology – subset of creation science that tries to explain biology without macroevolution.
* Creationist cosmologies – cosmologies which, among other things, allow for a universe that is only thousands of years old.
* Flood geology – creationist form of geology that advocates most of the geologic features on Earth are explainable by a global flood.
** Searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark – attempts to find the burial site of Noah&#x27;s Ark which, according to the Genesis flood narrative, is located somewhere in the alleged &quot;Mountains of Ararat&quot;. There have been numerous expeditions with several false claims of success; the practice is widely regarded as pseudoscience, more specifically pseudoarchaeology.
* Intelligent design – maintains that &quot;certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.&quot; These features include:
:* Irreducible complexity – claim that some biological systems are too complex to have evolved from simpler systems. It is used by proponents of intelligent design to argue that evolution by natural selection alone is incomplete or flawed, and that some additional mechanism (an &quot;Intelligent Designer&quot;) is required to explain the origins of life.
:* Specified complexity – claim that when something is simultaneously complex and specified, one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes.

=== Scientology ===
* Dianetics, a therapeutic technique promoted by Scientology, purports to treat a hypothetical reactive mind. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of an actual reactive mind, apart from the stimulus response mechanisms documented in behaviorist psychology.
* Narconon and Purification Rundown are Scientology programs that purport to clean the human body of toxins and drugs respectively. Their method consists of very long saunas over many days, extremely large (possibly toxic) doses of vitamins including niacin, and Scientology &#x27;training routines&#x27;, sometimes including attempts at telekinesis. The programs have been described as &quot;medically unsafe&quot;, &quot;quackery&quot; and &quot;medical fraud&quot;, while academic and medical experts have dismissed Narconon&#x27;s educational programme as containing &quot;factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling&quot;. In turn, Narconon has claimed that mainstream medicine is &quot;biased&quot; against it, and that &quot;people who endorse so-called controlled drug use cannot be trusted to review a program advocating totally drug-free living.&quot; Narconon has said that criticism of its programmes is &quot;bigoted&quot;, and that its critics are &quot;in favor of drug abuse [...] they are either using drugs or selling drugs&quot;.

=== Other ===
* Quantum mysticism – builds on a superficial similarity between certain New Age concepts and such seemingly counter-intuitive quantum mechanical concepts as the uncertainty principle, entanglement, and wave–particle duality, while generally ignoring the limitations imposed by quantum decoherence. One of the most abused ideas is Bell&#x27;s theorem, which proves the nonexistence of local hidden variables in quantum mechanics. Despite this, Bell himself rejected mystical interpretations of the theory.
* Transcendental Meditation (TM) refers to a specific form of silent mantra meditation and less commonly to the organizations that constitute the Transcendental Meditation movement. The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi created and introduced the TM technique and TM movement in India in the mid-1950s. It is not possible to say whether meditation has any effect on health, as the research is of poor quality, and is marred by a high risk for bias due to the connection of researchers to the TM organization and by the selection of subjects with a favorable opinion of TM.

== Idiosyncratic ideas ==
The following concepts have only a very small number of proponents, yet have become notable:
* Aquatic ape hypothesis – the idea that certain ancestors of modern humans were more aquatic than other great apes and even many modern humans and, as such, were habitual waders, swimmers and divers.
* Lawsonomy – proposed philosophy and system of claims about physics made by baseball player and aviator Alfred William Lawson.
* Morphic resonance – The idea put forth by Rupert Sheldrake that &quot;natural systems, such as termite colonies, or pigeons, or orchid plants, or insulin molecules, inherit a collective memory from all previous things of their kind&quot;. It is also claimed to be responsible for &quot;mysterious telepathy-type interconnections between organisms&quot;.
* N rays – A hypothesized form of radiation described by Prosper-René Blondlot in 1903 that briefly inspired significant scientific interest, but were subsequently found to have been a result of confirmation bias.
* Penta Water – the claimed acoustically-induced structural reorganization of liquid water into long-lived small clusters of five molecules each. Neither these clusters nor their asserted benefits to humans have been shown to exist.
* Polywater – hypothetical polymerized form of water proposed in the 1960s with a higher boiling point, lower freezing point, and much higher viscosity than ordinary water. It was later found not to exist, with the anomalous measurements being explained by biological contamination. Chains of molecules of varying length (depending on the temperature) tend to form in normal liquid water without changing the freezing or boiling point.
* Time Cube – a website created by Gene Ray, in 1997, where he sets out his personal model of reality, which he calls &quot;Time Cube&quot;. He suggests that all of modern physics is wrong, and his Time Cube model proposes that each day is really four separate days occurring simultaneously.
* Timewave zero – numerological formula that was invented by psychonaut Terence McKenna with the help of the hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine. After experiencing 2012 doomsday predictions, he redesigned his formula to have a &quot;zero-point&quot; at the same date as the Mayan longcount calendar.
* Torsion field – hypothetical physical field responsible for extra-sensory perception, homeopathic cures, levitation, telepathy, clairvoyance, telekinesis, and other paranormal phenomena. Despite the several obvious contradictions with established physics along with associated statements by believers criticized as being &quot;nonsensical&quot; by reputable scientists, torsion fields have been embraced as an explanation for claims of such paranormal phenomena. The harnessing of torsion fields has been claimed to make everything possible from miracle cure devices (including devices that cure alcohol addiction) to working perpetual motion machines, stargates, UFO propulsion analogs, and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Some such devices, in particular the miracle cure boxes, have been patented, manufactured and sold.

<text>The 1994 Northridge earthquake affected the Los Angeles area of California on January 17, 1994, at 04:30:55 PST. The epicenter of the moment 6.7 () blind thrust earthquake was beneath the San Fernando Valley. Lasting approximately 8 seconds and achieving the largest peak ground acceleration of over 1.7 &quot;g&quot;, it was the largest earthquake in the area since 1971. Shaking was felt as far away as San Diego, Turlock, Las Vegas, Richfield, Phoenix, and Ensenada. Fifty-seven people died and more than 9,000 were injured. In addition, property damage was estimated to be $13–50 billion, making it among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.

==Geology==
The epicenter region of the earthquake was located in the San Fernando Valley, about northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) placed the hypocenter&#x27;s geographical coordinates at and at a depth of . Measuring 6.7, it was the largest earthquake recorded in the Los Angeles area since the 1971 San Fernando earthquake ( 6.7). However, unlike the Northridge earthquake, the San Fernando shock occurred on a north–northeast dipping thrust fault beneath the San Gabriel Mountains. Motion during the Northridge event occurred along a south–southwest dipping blind thrust fault beneath the valley. The rupture propagated upward and northwestward along the fault plane for eight seconds at speeds of ~ per second. The fault planes that produced both earthquakes run parallel to each other. Several other faults experienced minor rupture during the main shock and other ruptures occurred during large aftershocks, or triggered events. The previously undiscovered fault that ruptured in 1994 was subsequently named the Northridge Blind Thrust Fault or Pico Thrust Fault.

Thrust faulting in the northern Los Angeles basin occurs in response to north–south crustal shortening. The fault responsible for the earthquake represented a component of a larger system of faults within the &quot;Big Bend&quot; stepover of the San Andreas Fault. Crustal compression occurs along this bend of the San Andreas Fault. The Transverse Range and Los Angeles basin hosts east–west striking thrust faults and folds that accommodate over of the compressive motion annually. This zone comprises north and south dipping faults that run subparallel to each other. Most of these faults are buried structures and only a handful reach the surface.

===Aftershocks===

Seismic observatories recorded 3,000 aftershocks greater than magnitude 1.5 in the three weeks following the mainshock. By comparing previous aftershock sequences in California against a decay rate equation, the Northridge aftershock activity was highly energetic but decayed marginally quicker than average. The strongest aftershock, measuring 5.9, was recorded one minute after the mainshock. These aftershocks were distributed in three zones; the first zone illuminated a fault structure dipping 35° to 45° at a depth range of . Another aftershock zone at shallower depth suggested diffuse tectonic behavior of an anticline above. The third aftershock cluster was in the Santa Susana Mountains after a 5.6 aftershock 11 hours after the mainshock. That event and its aftershocks were distributed along a strike and vertically within the crust, likely associated with faults that did not rupture during the mainshock.

===Ground effects===
The earthquake caused uplift across including the San Fernando Valley. Global Positioning System observations indicate the maximum uplift was . Direct observations at Oat Mountain suggest the Santa Susana Mountains were thrusted up . Across the northern valley area, uplift was as much as . The neighborhood of Northridge was raised . The USGS described the surface above the zone of greatest fault displacement as compressed into an &quot;asymmetric dome-shaped uplift&quot;. There was also of horizontal deformation which was the largest of its kind measured after the mainshock.

The USGS recorded over 11,000 landslides within ; most were recorded throughout a area that comprised the Santa Susana Mountains and ridges north of the Santa Clara River Valley. On average, these documented landslides were under , although a significant number of them were larger than . Rotational block slides were thought to be in the tens or hundreds, including a handful measuring over . The largest block slide measured . A majority of them occurred in the weak Tertiary to Pleistocene sediments and were previous landslides that became reactivated.

===Strong ground motion===
A seismometer at the Cedar Hill Nursery in Tarzana observed the greatest horizontal peak ground acceleration (pga) at 1.82 &quot;g&quot;, south of the epicenter. The recording was one of the largest observed during an earthquake at the time, yet buildings in the immediate vicinity only sustained broken windows and cracked walls and driveways. It garnered international scientific interest among those who visited the ranch in the aftermath, who installed additional instruments to record the aftershocks. The USGS Strong Motion Instrumentation Program ruled out technical malfunction and ground amplification effects, stating that the abnormally high pga recorded by a rock-bolted seismometer was authentic. The same site also recorded an unusually high pga (0.65 &quot;g&quot;) during a 1987 earthquake, though no abnormal readings were found during earthquakes in 1991 and 1992. USGS seismologist Rufus Catchings suggested the intense shaking was localised and most of the city was unharmed. A possible contributing factor for the effect is the local soil condition and topography. The maximum vertical pga recorded at the same station was 1.18 &quot;g&quot;.

Several sites in the valley also recorded pga exceeding 1.0 &quot;g&quot;. There were over 200 recordings of pga exceeding 0.01 &quot;g&quot;, and the horizontal component pga was larger than average for a reverse-mechanism event. A possible explanation for the high pga is due to the large seismic moment release within a small fault rupture. A peak ground velocity (pgv) of per second was measured at a station in Granada Hills. At the Sylmar county hospital, north–northeast of the epicenter, the pgv in the horizontal component was per second. South of the hospital, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Rinaldi Receiving Station recorded a pgv exceeding per second.

==Damage and fatalities==



Damage occurred up to away although it was concentrated in the west San Fernando Valley, and the cities and neighborhoods of Santa Monica, Hollywood, Simi Valley, and Santa Clarita. The Historic Egyptian Theater in Hollywood was red-tagged and closed as was the Capital Theater in Glendale due to structural damage. The exact number of fatalities is unknown, with sources estimating the number to be 60 or &quot;over 60&quot;, to 72, where most estimates fall around 60. The &quot;official&quot; death toll was placed at 57; 33 people died immediately or within a few days from injuries sustained, and many died from indirect causes, such as stress-induced cardiac events. Some counts factor in related events such as a man&#x27;s suicide possibly inspired by the loss of his business in the disaster. More than 8,700 were injured including 1,600 who required hospitalization. Actress Iris Adrian died in September 1994 from complications of a broken hip she suffered in the earthquake.

Sixteen people were killed as a result of the collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex. The Northridge Fashion Center and California State University, Northridge also sustained very heavy damage – most notably the collapse of parking structures. The earthquake also gained worldwide attention because of damage to the vast freeway network, which serves millions of commuters every day. The most notable was to the Santa Monica Freeway, Interstate 10, known as the busiest freeway in the United States, congesting nearby surface roads for three months while the freeway was repaired. Farther north, the Newhall Pass interchange of Interstate 5 (the Golden State Freeway) and State Route 14 (the Antelope Valley Freeway) collapsed as it had 23 years earlier in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, even though it had been rebuilt with minor improvements to the structural components. LAPD motorcycle officer Clarence Wayne Dean died because of the collapse of the Newhall Pass interchange, falling 40 feet from the damaged connector from southbound 14 to southbound I-5. He likely did not realize until too late in the early morning darkness that the elevated roadway had collapsed. The rebuilt interchange was renamed in his honor a year later.

Additional damage occurred about southeast in the city of Anaheim, located in Orange County, as the scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium collapsed onto several hundred seats. Most casualties and damage occurred in multi-story wood-frame buildings (such as the three-story Northridge Meadows apartment building). In particular, buildings with an unstable first floor (such as those with parking areas on the bottom) performed poorly. Numerous fires were also caused by broken gas lines from houses shifting off their foundations or unsecured water heaters tumbling. Slope side homes supported on one side by a concrete foundation and stilts on the other were also prone to collapse such as in Sherman Oaks where nine stilt homes crashed down a slope, killing four. In the San Fernando Valley, several underground gas and water lines were severed, resulting in some streets experiencing simultaneous fires and floods. Damage to the system resulted in water pressure dropping to zero in some areas; this predictably affected success in fighting subsequent fires. Five days later, it was estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 customers were still without public water service.

==Valley fever outbreak==
An unusual effect of the Northridge earthquake was an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) in Ventura County. This respiratory disease is caused by inhaling airborne spores of the fungus. The 203 cases reported, of which three resulted in fatalities, constituted roughly 10 times the normal rate in the initial eight weeks. This was the first report of such an outbreak following an earthquake, and it is believed that the spores were carried in large clouds of dust created by seismically triggered landslides. Most of the cases occurred immediately downwind of the landslides.

==Night sky==
With the earthquake taking place during the night, and with the power out, many people were able to see a dark night sky for the first time. Emergency services and the Griffith Observatory received many calls from people worried about a &quot;giant, silvery cloud&quot; in the sky, which was identified as being the Milky Way. This anecdote is often used when talking about light pollution.

==Facilities and infrastructure affected==
===Hospitals===
Eleven hospitals suffered structural damage and were damaged or rendered unusable. Not only were they unable to serve their local neighborhoods, but they also had to transfer out their inpatient populations, which further increased the burden on nearby hospitals that were still operational. As a result, the state legislature passed a law requiring all hospitals in California to ensure that their acute care units and emergency rooms would be in earthquake-resistant buildings by January 1, 2005. Most were unable to meet this deadline and only managed to achieve compliance in 2008 or 2009.

===Television, movie, and music productions===
The production of movies and TV shows was disrupted. At the time of the quake, before dawn on Monday morning, the Warner Bros. film &quot;Murder in the First&quot; (with Christian Slater, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Oldman) was being filmed only from the epicenter. Production came to a halt. The main courtroom set was in shambles. The building containing the set was later &quot;red tagged&quot; as unsafe due to the damage it sustained. The &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Profit and Loss&quot; was being filmed at the time, and actors Armin Shimerman and Edward Wiley left the Paramount Pictures lot in full Ferengi and Cardassian makeup, respectively. The season five episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; entitled &quot;The Pie&quot; was due to begin shooting on January 17 before stage sets were damaged. Also, ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot; set at ABC Television Center suffered partial structural collapse and water damage.

An earthquake scene was written in the screenplay of &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; and the earthquake occurred in the middle of its production timeline. Subsequently, the production company, New Line Cinema, incorporated real-life footage of the earthquake aftermath into the final cut.

Some archives of film and entertainment programming were also affected. For example, the original master films for the 1960s sitcom &quot;My Living Doll&quot; were destroyed.

In January 1994 Michael Jackson planned to record his new album but due to the earthquake, which terrified Jackson, they were moved to New York at The Hit Factory
===Transportation===
Portions of a number of major roads and freeways, including Interstate 10 over La Cienega Boulevard, and the interchanges of Interstate 5 with California State Route 14, 118, and Interstate 210, were closed because of structural failure or collapse. James E. Roberts was chief bridge engineer with Caltrans and was placed in charge of the seismic retrofit program for Caltrans until his death in 2006.

Rail service was briefly interrupted, with full Amtrak and expanded Metrolink service resuming in stages in the days after the quake. Interruptions to road transport caused Metrolink to experiment with service to Camarillo in February and Oxnard in April, which continues today as the Ventura County Line, and extended the Antelope Valley Line almost ten years ahead of schedule. Six new stations opened in six weeks. Metrolink leased equipment from Amtrak, San Francisco&#x27;s Caltrain, and Toronto, Canada&#x27;s GO Transit to handle the sudden onslaught of passengers. Amtrak ceased service in the Pasadena Subdivision following structural damage to a rail bridge in Arcadia and redirected all rail traffic through Riverside and Fullerton. All MTA bus lines operated service with detours and delays on the day of the quake. Los Angeles International Airport and other airports in the area were also shut down as a 2-hour precaution, including Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (now Hollywood Burbank Airport) and Van Nuys Airport, which is near the epicenter, where the control tower suffered from radar failure and panel collapse. The airport was reopened in stages after the quake.

===California State University, Northridge===
California State University, Northridge, was the closest university to the epicenter. Many campus buildings were heavily damaged and a parking structure collapsed. Many classes were moved to temporary structures. Much of the campus infrastructure was damaged and there were multiple fires and explosions throughout the campus. The earthquake damaged several buildings and destroyed all communications, including telephone lines, and caused computer systems to shut down. Two CSUN students died at the Northridge Meadows Complex along with 14 other residents.

==== Campus damage ====
All 58 buildings on campus sustained significant damage, resulting in a $406 million recovery effort. The Oviatt Library experienced both interior and exterior damage, but the overall frame of the central part of the building remained stable, allowing student use to continue. In the Science Complex, Building #1 and #2 suffered fire damage while the bridges connecting buildings #3 and #4 were closed and named unstable. The University Tower apartments, Fine Arts Building and the South Library were damaged beyond repair and demolished. Photographs of the recently constructed Parking Structure C which collapsed became synonymous with the earthquake&#x27;s effects on the university.

==== Classes and enrollment ====
The damage delayed the start of the 1994 Spring semester by two weeks. The campus mobilised 335 makeshift structures for its usage. Some 25 classes were held at Pierce College, LA City College and UCLA, while others were outdoors or in trailer buildings. The campus was unable to use any of its classrooms because of the damage the buildings sustained. CSUN President Dr. Blenda Wilson assured the rental of temporary structures to be placed in available spaces throughout the campus. An estimated $350 million (equivalent to $ million today) was used to supply the number of trailers and domes which housed classes and administration offices. Enrollment dropped by approximately 1,000 students, leaving some homeless as dormitories were closed due to damage that rendered them unsafe and which required repair.
==== External resources ====
The seismic event led to millions of dollars worth of damage resulting in a sharp drop in student enrollment. CSUN received financial assistance for its efforts in reestablishing the damaged buildings with monetary gifts from the McCarthy Foundation, the Common Wealth Fund, and the Union Bank Foundation. In addition, the campus received a $23,000 check (equivalent to $ today) from the &quot;Los Angeles Times Valley Edition&quot; for the journalism department. CSUN also received assistance from government agencies FEMA and OES to support the recovery effort and serve the needs of the local community. UCLA&#x27;s Westwood campus opened their doors and allowed CSUN students to use their libraries while providing shuttle buses to and from the university.

===Entertainment and sports===
Universal Studios Hollywood shut down the attraction, based on the 1974 motion picture blockbuster, &quot;Earthquake&quot;. It was closed for the second time since the Loma Prieta earthquake. Angel Stadium of Anaheim (then known as Anaheim Stadium) suffered some damage when the scoreboard fell into the seats, forcing a Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group off-road race at the ballpark to be postponed from that upcoming weekend to February 12.

===Other buildings===

Numerous Los Angeles museums, including the Art Deco Building in Hollywood, were closed, as were numerous city shopping malls. Gazzarri&#x27;s nightclub suffered irreparable damage and had to be torn down. The city of Santa Monica suffered significant damage. Many multifamily apartment buildings in Santa Monica were yellow-tagged and red-tagged. An especially hard hit area was between Santa Monica Canyon and Saint John&#x27;s Hospital, a linear corridor that suffered a significant amount of property damage. The City of Santa Monica provided assistance to landlords dealing with repairs so tenants could return home as soon as possible. In Valencia, the California Institute of the Arts experienced heavy damage, with classes relocated to a nearby Lockheed test facility for the remainder of 1994. The Los Angeles Unified School District closed local schools throughout the area, which reopened one week later. UCLA and other local universities were also shut down. The University of Southern California suffered some structural damage to several older campus buildings, but classes were conducted as scheduled. Pierce College suffered $2 million in damages, the most affected of the nine Los Angeles community colleges.

==Aftermath==

=== Lifestyle disruptions in the weeks following ===
In the weeks following the quake, many San Fernando Valley residents had either lost their homes entirely or experienced structural damage too severe to continue living in them without making repairs. Although the vast majority of homes in the area, with the exception of a few particular neighborhoods, were relatively unaffected; many feared an aftershock to rival or exceed the severity of the first one. While a notable aftershock never came, many residents opted to stay in shelters or live with friends and family outside the area for a short time following.

While many businesses remained closed in the days following the quake, some infrastructure was not able to be rebuilt for months, even years later. The daily commute for many drivers in the weeks following was significantly lengthened, notably for those traveling between Santa Clarita and Los Angeles, and commuters on I-10 traveling to and from the Westside. Additionally, many businesses were forced to relocate or use temporary facilities in order to accommodate structural damage to their original locations or the difficulty accessing them. Some people even made temporary relocations closer to their jobs while their homes or neighborhoods were being rebuilt.

===State legislative response===
The Northridge earthquake led to a number of legislative changes. Due to the large amount lost by insurance companies, most insurance companies either stopped offering or severely restricted earthquake insurance in California. In response, the California Legislature created the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), which is a publicly managed but privately funded organization that offers minimal coverage. A substantial effort was also made to reinforce freeway bridges against seismic shaking, and a law requiring water heaters to be properly strapped was passed in 1995.

===Engineering analysis===
The analysis of the effect of Northridge earthquake on behavior of structures has been investigated by many researchers. For example, the behavior of underground walls has been evaluated for the Northridge earthquake using numerical methods. The comparison of the seismic behavior of underground braced walls with ACI 318 design method reveals that bending moment and shear force of the walls under Northridge earthquake loads were observed to reach 2.8 and 2.7 times as large as the respective allowable limits. Therefore, caution should be taken in seismic design of diaphragm walls using ACI 318 code requirements.

==In popular culture==
* The Northridge Earthquake was the subject of the 1995 film &quot;Epicenter U.&quot;, a first-hand account of healing from the natural disaster, directed by Alexis Krasilovsky. &quot;The Earthquake Haggadah&quot; (1995) was a video excerpt from &quot;Epicenter U.&quot; narrated by Wanda Coleman. Distributed in 3/4&quot; and VHS by the Poetry Film Workshop circa 1998. Re-released as part of the DVD &quot;Some Women Writers Kill Themselves&quot; in 2008.
* The Northridge earthquake was used as a plot device in the 2004 film &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot;. The film is a modern retelling of the Cinderella classic starring Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. In it, Duff&#x27;s character, Sam Montgomery, lives in the San Fernando Valley with her father, stepmother, and two stepsisters. Her father, Hal, perishes in the quake trying to save her stepmother, setting the story in motion.
* A song about the earthquake, set to the tune of &quot;Happy Farmer&quot;, was featured in the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; episode &quot;A Quake, A Quake!&quot;.
* The title of the song play &quot;I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky&quot; by John Adams and June Jordan was a quote from an earthquake survivor. The story&#x27;s premise also takes places after an earthquake.

<doc id="267050" wikidata="Q1441510" url="?curid=267050" title="Francis Garnier">
<text>Marie Joseph François Garnier (; 25 July 1839 – 21 December 1873) was a French officer, inspector of Indigenous Affairs of Cochinchina and explorer. He eventually became mission leader of the Mekong Exploration Commission in 19th century Southeast Asia.

==Early career==
Francis Garnier was born on 25 July 1839 in Saint-Étienne, as the second son of Louis-Alexandre Garnier and Anne Marie Félicité Garnier. In 1855, at 16, he joined the Ecole Navale, much to the dismay of his family who disapproved a military career, deeming it as being dangerous.

In early 1860, 20 years old Garnier, then serving as an aspirant on the &quot;Duperré&quot; during the Second Opium War, jumped into a stormy sea at night to save the life of a cavalry lieutenant who had fallen overboard. For this act of bravery, Garnier was immediately promoted to ensign and got attached to the staff of Admiral Charner.

Under Admiral Charner he fought in the Cochinchina Campaign and notably took part in the storming of the Kỳ Hòa lines.

After some time spent in France, Garnier returned to the East, and in 1862, he was appointed inspector of native affairs in Cochinchina, and entrusted with the administration of Cholon, a suburb of Saigon.
== Exploration of the Mekong and Yangtze rivers ==

It was at his suggestion that the marquis de Chasseloup-Laubat determined to send a mission to explore the valley of the Mekong River, but as Garnier was not considered old enough to be put in command, the chief authority was entrusted to Captain Ernest Doudard de Lagrée. In the course of the expedition – to quote the words of Sir Roderick Murchison addressed to the youthful traveller when, in 1870, he was presented with the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London – &quot;from Kratié in Cambodia to Shanghai 5392 miles were traversed, and of these, 3625 miles, chiefly of country unknown to European geography, were surveyed with care, and the positions fixed by astronomical observations, nearly the whole of the observations being taken by Garnier himself&quot;. A year earlier he received an award to be shared with David Livingstone at the 1869 Geographical Congress in Antwerp.

Volunteering to lead a detachment to Dali, the capital of Sultan Suleiman, the sovereign of the Muslim rebels in Yunnan, Garnier successfully carried out the more-than-adventurous enterprise. When shortly afterwards Lagrée died, Garnier naturally assumed the command of the expedition, and he conducted it in safety to the Yangtze River, and thus to the Chinese coast. On his return to France, he was received with enthusiasm. The preparation of his narrative was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War
==Franco-Prussian War==
During the siege of Paris, Garnier served as principal staff officer to the admiral in command of the eighth sector. His experiences during the siege were published anonymously in the &quot;feuilleton&quot; of &quot;Le Temps&quot;, and appeared separately as &quot;Le Siège de Paris, journal d&#x27;un officier de marine&quot; (1871).
One day, while he was carrying a wagon full of ammunitions to the Fort of Vanves alongside 40 fellow fighters, the convoy came under a brutal rain of Prussian shells. All of the surviving men ran away forsaking their mission, except for Garnier and a man of the National Guard who held on and brought the wagon to destination, just the two of them.
Returning to Cochinchina, he found the political circumstances of the country unfavourable to further exploration, so accordingly, he went to China, and in 1873 followed the upper course of the Yangtze River to the waterfalls.
== Intervention in Tonkin ==
In late summer 1873, a dispute between French trader Jean Dupuis and the Vietnamese authorities had created a diplomatic crisis in Hanoi. On the demand of the Vietnamese imperial court, Garnier was sent by Admiral Dupré to resolve the dispute and to expel Dupuis and his mercenaries from the Tonkin. Garnier&#x27;s expeditionary force consisted in 180 men and two gunboats.
Garnier departed from Saigon with half of the expeditionary force on 11 October 1873 and reached Hanoi on 5 November. As Garnier and his men arrived in the city, neither General Nguyễn Tri Phương, nor any of his mandarins came to meet them. Dupuis, however, warmly welcomed the French. After meeting with Dupuis, Garnier attempted to negotiate with the local authorities, but since the mandarins refused to negotiate, he began considering military action. On 12 November, the remainder of the expeditionary force arrived, and Garnier decided to capture the city despite having received no orders to do so.
On 20 November at dawn, Garnier and his 180 men stormed the citadel of Hanoi, which was defended by 7,000 soldiers. Completely dumbfounded by the French attack, the defenders performed poorly, and when General Nguyễn Tri Phương was severely injured, their morale completely collapsed. As French troops entered through the southern gates, most of the defenders ran away through the northern gate. In less than an hour, the French had captured the citadel. The only French casualty was one of Dupuis&#x27;s Chinese mercenaries, who had accidentally been killed by French sailors. Vietnamese casualties however were heavy, as they had lost 80 killed, 300 wounded and 2,000 captured. Nguyễn Tri Phương was badly injured and died of his wounds on 20 December.
Emboldened by this crushing victory, Garnier and his men soon launched an unsanctioned military campaign that resulted in the conquest of the entire Red River Delta within two weeks. One of his subordinates, 24-year-old ensign Balny d&#x27;Avricourt, conquered the citadels of Phu Ly and Hai Duong with only 30 men. On 5 December, 21-year-old aspirant Hautefeuille captured the citadel of Ninh Binh with six sailors and a Vietnamese interpreter after taking the governor hostage. On 11 December, Garnier himself conquered the citadel of Nam Dinh, and the expeditionary force received its first casualties as five sailors were wounded.
With the fall of Nam Dinh on 11 December, the French force was in control of the entire Red River Delta.

== Death in battle near Hanoi==
Completely overwhelmed by the lightning French conquest, the Vietnamese authorities had sought the help of Liu Yongfu and his Black Flag Army, a group of Chinese outlaws, composed largely of veterans of the Taiping Rebellion, who had settled in Northern Vietnam.
On 21 December 1873 Liu Yongfu and around 600 Black Flags (, ), marching beneath an enormous black banner, approached the west gate of Hanoi. A large Vietnamese army followed in their wake. Garnier began shelling the Black Flags with a field piece mounted above the gate, and when they began to fall back he led a party of 18 French marines and sailors out of the city to pursue them, hoping to inflict some decisive blow. The counter-attack failed. Garnier, leading three men uphill in a bayonet attack on a party of Black Flags, was stabbed and hacked to death by several Black Flag soldiers after stumbling in a watercourse. The youthful &quot;enseigne de vaisseau&quot; Adrien Balny d&#x27;Avricourt led an equally small column out of the citadel to support Garnier, but was also killed at the head of his men. Three French sailors were also killed in these sorties, and the others fled back to the citadel after their officers fell.
Colonel Thomazi, the historian of French Indochina, gave the following detailed description of Garnier&#x27;s last moments:

Despite having killed the leader of the French force, the Black Flags and Vietnamese retreated without having retaken Hanoi. Though the death of Garnier was a severe blow to the expeditionary force, his men nevertheless remained in control of the entire region. However, the conquest had not been allowed by the French authorities, and another lieutenant named Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre had been sent to terminate the campaign as soon as the news of Garnier&#x27;s attack on Hanoi reached Saigon. Philastre arrived a few days after Garnier&#x27;s death and immediately ordered the evacuation of the conquered cities in early 1874.
The heads of Garnier, Balny d&#x27;Avricourt and the other three French sailors killed in the 21 December attack were returned to the French on 6 January.
On 15 March 1874, the Treaty of Saigon was then signed between France and Vietnam. In exchange for France having given back the conquered cities, Vietnam formally recognized French sovereignty over Cochinchina, opened the Red River to French trade and allowed the establishment of small French garrisons in Hanoi and Haiphong.

== Achievement ==
Garnier&#x27;s chief fame rests on the fact that he both conceived the idea of exploring the Mekong and carried out the larger portion of the work. During the French colonial period he was also honoured for his feats of arms in Tonkin, which paved the way for the eventual French conquest of Tonkin in the 1880s.
== Commemoration ==

In 1883, nine years after Francis Garnier&#x27;s death, the French naval officer Henri Rivière was also killed by the Black Flags in Tonkin, in remarkably similar circumstances.

Garnier and Rivière were honoured during the French colonial period as the two pre-eminent French martyrs of the conquest of Tonkin. In 1884, during the Sino-French War, two gunboats of the Tonkin Flotilla were named after the two men.

During the siege of Tuyên Quang (November 1884–March 1885), Liu Yung-fu&#x27;s Black Flags, who formed part of the besieging Chinese army, taunted the men of the French garrison by chanting the names of their two most famous victims: &#x27;Garnier! Rivière! Garnier! Rivière!&#x27;

In 1911, the town Beni Haoua in French Algeria was renamed &#x27;Francis Garnier&#x27;, and retained this name until the independence in 1962.

In 1943, French Indochina issued a postage stamp commemorating Garnier.
* A warship was named after him during World War II but was scuttled after a fight with the Japanese, near the Cambodian town of Kratié.
* In 1973 the landing ship , was built. It still is in service and was ordered to assist the humanitarian efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake as part of &quot;Opération Séisme Haiti 2010&quot;. She left Martinique carrying 60 Army personnel, land vehicles and excavators; and various relief shipments.

<text>A finite geometry is any geometric system that has only a finite number of points.
The familiar Euclidean geometry is not finite, because a Euclidean line contains infinitely many points. A geometry based on the graphics displayed on a computer screen, where the pixels are considered to be the points, would be a finite geometry. While there are many systems that could be called finite geometries, attention is mostly paid to the finite projective and affine spaces because of their regularity and simplicity. Other significant types of finite geometry are finite Möbius or inversive planes and Laguerre planes, which are examples of a general type called Benz planes, and their higher-dimensional analogs such as higher finite inversive geometries.

Finite geometries may be constructed via linear algebra, starting from vector spaces over a finite field; the affine and projective planes so constructed are called Galois geometries. Finite geometries can also be defined purely axiomatically. Most common finite geometries are Galois geometries, since any finite projective space of dimension three or greater is isomorphic to a projective space over a finite field (that is, the projectivization of a vector space over a finite field). However, dimension two has affine and projective planes that are not isomorphic to Galois geometries, namely the non-Desarguesian planes. Similar results hold for other kinds of finite geometries.

==Finite planes==
The following remarks apply only to finite &quot;planes&quot;.
There are two main kinds of finite plane geometry: affine and projective.
In an affine plane, the normal sense of parallel lines applies.
In a projective plane, by contrast, any two lines intersect at a unique point, so parallel lines do not exist. Both finite affine plane geometry and finite projective plane geometry may be described by fairly simple axioms.

=== Finite affine planes ===

An affine plane geometry is a nonempty set &quot;X&quot; (whose elements are called &quot;points&quot;), along with a nonempty collection &quot;L&quot; of subsets of &quot;X&quot; (whose elements are called &quot;lines&quot;), such that:
# For every two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both points.
# Playfair&#x27;s axiom: Given a line formula_1 and a point formula_2 not on formula_1, there exists exactly one line formula_4 containing formula_2 such that formula_6
# There exists a set of four points, no three of which belong to the same line.
The last axiom ensures that the geometry is not &quot;trivial&quot; (either empty or too simple to be of interest, such as a single line with an arbitrary number of points on it), while the first two specify the nature of the geometry.

The simplest affine plane contains only four points; it is called the &quot;affine plane of order&quot; 2. (The order of an affine plane is the number of points on any line, see below.) Since no three are collinear, any pair of points determines a unique line, and so this plane contains six lines. It corresponds to a tetrahedron where non-intersecting edges are considered &quot;parallel&quot;, or a square where not only opposite sides, but also diagonals are considered &quot;parallel&quot;.

The affine plane of order 3 is known as the Hesse configuration.

More generally, a finite affine plane of order &quot;n&quot; has &quot;n&quot;2 points and lines; each line contains &quot;n&quot; points, and each point is on lines.

=== Finite projective planes ===

A projective plane geometry is a nonempty set &quot;X&quot; (whose elements are called &quot;points&quot;), along with a nonempty collection &quot;L&quot; of subsets of &quot;X&quot; (whose elements are called &quot;lines&quot;), such that:
# For every two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both points.
# The intersection of any two distinct lines contains exactly one point.
# There exists a set of four points, no three of which belong to the same line.

An examination of the first two axioms shows that they are nearly identical, except that the roles of points and lines have been interchanged.
This suggests the principle of duality for projective plane geometries, meaning that any true statement valid in all these geometries remains true if we exchange points for lines and lines for points.
The smallest geometry satisfying all three axioms contains seven points. In this simplest of the projective planes, there are also seven lines; each point is on three lines, and each line contains three points.
This particular projective plane is sometimes called the Fano plane.
If any of the lines is removed from the plane, along with the points on that line, the resulting geometry is the affine plane of order 2.
The Fano plane is called the &quot;projective plane of order&quot; 2 because it is unique (up to isomorphism).
In general, the projective plane of order &quot;n&quot; has &quot;n&quot;2 + &quot;n&quot; + 1 points and the same number of lines; each line contains &quot;n&quot; + 1 points, and each point is on &quot;n&quot; + 1 lines.

A permutation of the Fano plane&#x27;s seven points that carries collinear points (points on the same line) to collinear points is called a collineation of the plane. The full collineation group is of order 168 and is isomorphic to the group PSL(2,7) ≈ PSL(3,2), which in this special case is also isomorphic to the general linear group .

=== Order of planes ===
A finite plane of order &quot;n&quot; is one such that each line has &quot;n&quot; points (for an affine plane), or such that each line has &quot;n&quot; + 1 points (for a projective plane). One major open question in finite geometry is:
:&quot;Is the order of a finite plane always a prime power?&quot;
This is conjectured to be true.

Affine and projective planes of order &quot;n&quot; exist whenever &quot;n&quot; is a prime power (a prime number raised to a positive integer exponent), by using affine and projective planes over the finite field with elements. Planes not derived from finite fields also exist (e.g. for formula_7), but all known examples have order a prime power.

The best general result to date is the Bruck–Ryser theorem of 1949, which states:
:If &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer of the form or and &quot;n&quot; is not equal to the sum of two integer squares, then &quot;n&quot; does not occur as the order of a finite plane.

The smallest integer that is not a prime power and not covered by the Bruck–Ryser theorem is 10; 10 is of the form , but it is equal to the sum of squares . The non-existence of a finite plane of order 10 was proven in a computer-assisted proof that finished in 1989 – see for details.

The next smallest number to consider is 12, for which neither a positive nor a negative result has been proved.

===History===
Individual examples can be found in the work of Thomas Penyngton Kirkman (1847) and the systematic development of finite projective geometry given by von Staudt (1856).

The first axiomatic treatment of finite projective geometry was developed by the Italian mathematician Gino Fano. In his work on proving the independence of the set of axioms for projective &quot;n&quot;-space that he developed, he considered a finite three dimensional space with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes (see diagram), in which each line had only three points on it.

In 1906 Oswald Veblen and W. H. Bussey described projective geometry using homogeneous coordinates with entries from the Galois field GF(&quot;q&quot;). When &quot;n&quot; + 1 coordinates are used, the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional finite geometry is denoted PG(&quot;n, q&quot;). It arises in synthetic geometry and has an associated transformation group.

==Finite spaces of 3 or more dimensions==
For some important differences between finite &quot;plane&quot; geometry and the geometry of higher-dimensional finite spaces, see axiomatic projective space. For a discussion of higher-dimensional finite spaces in general, see, for instance, the works of J.W.P. Hirschfeld. The study of these higher-dimensional spaces () has many important applications in advanced mathematical theories.

===Axiomatic definition===
A projective space &quot;S&quot; can be defined axiomatically as a set &quot;P&quot; (the set of points), together with a set &quot;L&quot; of subsets of &quot;P&quot; (the set of lines), satisfying these axioms :
* Each two distinct points &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are in exactly one line.
* Veblen&#x27;s axiom: If &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; are distinct points and the lines through &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;cd&quot; meet, then so do the lines through &quot;ac&quot; and &quot;bd&quot;.
* Any line has at least 3 points on it.

The last axiom eliminates reducible cases that can be written as a disjoint union of projective spaces together with 2-point lines joining any two points in distinct projective spaces. More abstractly, it can be defined as an incidence structure consisting of a set &quot;P&quot; of points, a set &quot;L&quot; of lines, and an incidence relation &quot;I&quot; stating which points lie on which lines.

Obtaining a &quot;finite&quot; projective space requires one more axiom:
* The set of points &quot;P&quot; is a finite set.

In any finite projective space, each line contains the same number of points and the &quot;order&quot; of the space is defined as one less than this common number.

A subspace of the projective space is a subset &quot;X&quot;, such that any line containing two points of &quot;X&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot; (that is, completely contained in &quot;X&quot;). The full space and the empty space are always subspaces.

The &quot;geometric dimension&quot; of the space is said to be &quot;n&quot; if that is the largest number for which there is a strictly ascending chain of subspaces of this form:

: formula_8

===Algebraic construction===
A standard algebraic construction of systems satisfies these axioms. For a division ring &quot;D&quot; construct an -dimensional vector space over &quot;D&quot; (vector space dimension is the number of elements in a basis). Let &quot;P&quot; be the 1-dimensional (single generator) subspaces and &quot;L&quot; the 2-dimensional (two independent generators) subspaces (closed under vector addition) of this vector space. Incidence is containment. If &quot;D&quot; is finite then it must be a finite field GF(&quot;q&quot;), since by Wedderburn&#x27;s little theorem all finite division rings are fields. In this case, this construction produces a finite projective space. Furthermore, if the geometric dimension of a projective space is at least three then there is a division ring from which the space can be constructed in this manner. Consequently, all finite projective spaces of geometric dimension at least three are defined over finite fields. A finite projective space defined over such a finite field has points on a line, so the two concepts of order coincide. Such a finite projective space is denoted by , where PG stands for projective geometry, &quot;n&quot; is the geometric dimension of the geometry and &quot;q&quot; is the size (order) of the finite field used to construct the geometry.

In general, the number of &quot;k&quot;-dimensional subspaces of is given by the product:
:formula_9
which is a Gaussian binomial coefficient, a &quot;q&quot; analogue of a binomial coefficient.

===Classification of finite projective spaces by geometric dimension===
*Dimension 0 (no lines): The space is a single point and is so degenerate that it is usually ignored.
*Dimension 1 (exactly one line): All points lie on the unique line, called a &quot;projective line&quot;.
*Dimension 2: There are at least 2 lines, and any two lines meet. A projective space for is a projective plane. These are much harder to classify, as not all of them are isomorphic with a . The Desarguesian planes (those that are isomorphic with a ) satisfy Desargues&#x27;s theorem and are projective planes over finite fields, but there are many non-Desarguesian planes.
*Dimension at least 3: Two non-intersecting lines exist. The Veblen–Young theorem states in the finite case that every projective space of geometric dimension is isomorphic with a , the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space over some finite field GF(&quot;q&quot;).

===The smallest projective three-space===
The smallest 3-dimensional projective space is over the field GF(2) and is denoted by PG(3,2). It has 15 points, 35 lines, and 15 planes. Each plane contains 7 points and 7 lines. Each line contains 3 points. As geometries, these planes are isomorphic to the Fano plane.

Every point is contained in 7 lines. Every pair of distinct points are contained in exactly one line and every pair of distinct planes intersects in exactly one line.

In 1892, Gino Fano was the first to consider such a finite geometry.

====Kirkman&#x27;s schoolgirl problem====

PG(3,2) arises as the background for a solution of Kirkman&#x27;s schoolgirl problem, which states: &quot;Fifteen schoolgirls walk each day in five groups of three. Arrange the girls’ walk for a week so that in that time, each pair of girls walks together in a group just once.&quot; There are 35 different combinations for the girls to walk together. There are also 7 days of the week, and 3 girls in each group. Two of the seven non-isomorphic solutions to this problem can be stated in terms of structures in the Fano 3-space, PG(3,2), known as &quot;packings&quot;. A spread of a projective space is a partition of its points into disjoint lines, and a packing is a partition of the lines into disjoint spreads. In PG(3,2), a spread would be a partition of the 15 points into 5 disjoint lines (with 3 points on each line), thus corresponding to the arrangement of schoolgirls on a particular day. A packing of PG(3,2) consists of seven disjoint spreads and so corresponds to a full week of arrangements.
