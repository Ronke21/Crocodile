<text>Marshal is a term used in several official titles in various branches of society. As marshals became trusted members of the courts of Medieval Europe, the title grew in reputation. During the last few centuries, it has been used for elevated offices, such as in military rank and civilian law enforcement.

In most countries, the rank of Marshal is the highest Army rank (equivalent to a five-star General of the Army in the United States).

==Etymology==
&quot;Marshal&quot; is an ancient loanword from Norman French (cf. modern French &quot;maréchal&quot;), which in turn is borrowed from Old Frankish *&quot;&quot; (=&quot;stable boy, keeper, servant&quot;), being still evident in Middle Dutch &quot;maerscalc&quot;, &quot;marscal&quot;, and in modern Dutch &quot;maarschalk&quot; (=&quot;military chief commander&quot;; the meaning influenced by the French use).

It is cognate with Old High German &quot;&quot; &quot;id.&quot;, modern German &quot;(Feld-)Marschall&quot; (=&quot;military chief commander&quot;; the meaning again influenced by the French use).

It originally and literally meant &quot;horse servant&quot;, from Germanic &quot;*marha-&quot; &quot;horse&quot; (cf. English &quot;mare&quot; and modern German &quot;Mähre&quot;, meaning &quot;horse of bad quality&quot;) and &quot;*skalk-&quot; &quot;servant&quot; (cf. Old Engl. &quot;scealc&quot; &quot;servant, soldier&quot; and outdated German &quot;Schalk&quot;, meaning &quot;high-ranking servant&quot;). This &quot;horse servant&quot; origin is retained in the current French name for &quot;farrier&quot;: &quot;maréchal-ferrant&quot;.

The late Roman and Byzantine title of &quot;comes stabuli&quot; (&quot;count of the stables&quot;) was a &quot;calque&quot; of the Germanic, which became Old French &quot;&quot; and modern &quot;connétable&quot;, and, borrowed from the Old French, the English word &quot;constable&quot;. Finally, in Byzantium, a marshal with elevated authority, notably a borderlands military command, was also known as an &quot;exarch&quot;.

==Military==

In many countries, the rank of marshal, cf. field marshal, is the highest army rank, outranking other general officers. The equivalent navy rank is often admiral of the fleet or grand admiral.

Marshals are typically, but not exclusively, appointed only in wartime. In many countries, especially in Europe, the special symbol of a marshal is a baton, and their insignia often incorporate batons.

In some countries, the term &quot;marshal&quot; is used instead of &quot;general&quot; in the higher air force ranks. The four highest Royal Air Force ranks are marshal of the Royal Air Force, air chief marshal, air marshal and air vice marshal (although the first named, which has generally been suspended as a peacetime rank, is the only one which can properly be considered a marshal). The five-star rank of marshal of the Air Force is used by some Commonwealth and Middle Eastern air forces.

In the French Army and most National Armies modeled upon the French system, &quot;maréchal des logis&quot; (&quot;marshal-of-lodgings&quot;) is a cavalry term equivalent to sergeant.

Some historical rulers have used special &quot;marshal&quot; titles to reward certain subjects. Though not strictly military ranks, these honorary titles have been exclusively bestowed upon successful military leaders, such as the famous grand marshal of Ayacucho Antonio José de Sucre. Most famous are the Marshals of France (&quot;Maréchaux de France&quot;), not least under Napoléon I. Another such title was that of &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot;, bestowed upon Hermann Göring by Adolf Hitler, although it was never a regular title as it had been &quot;invented&quot; for Göring who was the only titleholder in history. In England during the First Barons&#x27; War the title &quot;Marshal of the Army of God and Holy Church&quot; was bestowed upon Robert Fitzwalter by election.

Both the Soviet Union and Russia have army general as well as &quot;marshal&quot; in their rank system.

==Ceremonial and protocol==
Usually in monarchies, one or several of the senior dignitaries wear the title of &quot;Marshal&quot; or a compound such as &quot;Court Marshal&quot; (not related to court martial, therefore usually called &quot;Marshal of the Court&quot; to prevent confusion) or more rarely &quot;Grand Marshal&quot;.

The function of the &quot;Marshal of the Court&quot; varies according to national tradition, but frequently he is the chief of staff of the monarch&#x27;s household (meaning the palace and other domains). Often, the charge includes also the honorary privilege as chief of the protocol to announce formally the arrival of VIP guests at audiences, state dinners, and conferences in the monarch&#x27;s premises. This office was often made hereditary in the high nobility, e.g., the English Earl Marshal, or the Scots Earl Marischal.

==Civilian==

The term is also used in more ordinary contexts, such as modern pageantry; for example, the &quot;grand marshal&quot; of a parade is often an honored guest or dignitary.

In the United States, many colleges and universities have marshals. In some cases, there is a single &quot;faculty marshal,&quot; appointed to the post on a more or less permanent basis. In other cases, there are one or several faculty marshals, and often one or several student marshals appointed for a single occasion. In all cases, the post is one of honor given to a senior faculty member or outstanding student, and the functions are generally limited to leading processions or parts of processions during commencement exercises, academic convocations, encaenia and similar events. These marshals often carry maces, staffs or wands of office.

A chief usher at a large wedding is sometimes called a &quot;wedding marshal&quot;. In addition to coordinating other ushers in attending guests, the wedding marshal may be a messenger between parties to signal the impending start of the service or communicate delays. In a church wedding, particularly a nuptial mass, these functions may be assumed by a verger. The wedding marshal is a position of honor and trust, often filled by a close friend or relative.

==Political==

===Dignitaries of Poland===

Apart from its military uses, the Polish word &quot;marszałek&quot; (marshal) also refers to certain political offices:
*&quot;Marszałek Sejmu&quot; and &quot;Marszałek Senatu&quot;: the respective speakers of the lower house (Sejm) and upper house (Senate) of Poland&#x27;s parliament, usually nominated by the governing party or coalition;
*&quot;Marszałek Województwa&quot; (voivodeship marshal): since 1999, the leader of the executive of a voivodeship (one of Poland&#x27;s 16 provinces), elected by the regional assembly (sejmik), and co-existing with the government-appointed voivode (governor).

===Demonstration marshal===

Demonstration marshals, also called stewards, are used by the organizers of large or controversial demonstrations, rallies and protests, to help ensure the safety of the participants. They are especially important for preventing infiltration by agents provocateurs.

==Sports==

===Racing and other competitions===
In motorsports, such as auto racing, motorcycle racing, and rallying, the track marshals wave the racing flags and assist crashed or broken-down vehicles and their drivers, while pit marshals watch over the procedures in the pits, and fire marshals assist in the event of a fire on the track or in the pit. The FIA provides general rules and recommendations on marshalling. In the 1977 South African Grand Prix, 1977 Japanese Grand Prix, 2000 Italian Grand Prix, 2001 Australian Grand Prix, and 2013 Canadian Grand Prix, track marshals were victims of fatal accidents.

In some organized competitions, such as the endurance competition &quot;Tough Guy,&quot; officials seeing to the observance of the rules are styled marshals. In road running races, in particular, &quot;course marshals&quot; enforce rules of competition and assist runners as needed.

==Games==
The marshal is the highest playing piece in the board game &quot;Stratego&quot;.

==Law enforcement==

The word &quot;Maréchaussée&quot; derives from the French word &quot;Maréchal&quot; (plural &quot;Maréchaux&quot;), which was the second highest military charge in feudal France after &quot;Connétable&quot; (Constable), the military Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armed Forces until 1627, when the charge of Constable was abolished. The Constable and the Marshals had also jurisdictional powers, at first only over members of the armed forces. The additional conferring of police powers led to the creation of the &quot;Corps of the &quot;Maréchaussée&quot;&quot; (&quot;Marshalcy&quot;; the forerunner of the modern &quot;Gendarmerie&quot;) and to an Ancien Régime Court of Justice called the &quot;Tribunal of the Constable and the Marshals of France&quot; which was competent for judging military personnel and civilians alike in cases of petty violations of the law.

The term &quot;Maréchaussée&quot; was also used for the Continental Army&#x27;s military police during the American Revolution.

In the present-day Netherlands, the &quot;Koninklijke Marechaussee&quot; (&quot;Royal Marshalcy&quot;) is a national military police force with civilian competences, similar to the French &quot;Gendarmerie nationale&quot;.

==United States==
In the United States, &quot;marshal&quot; is used particularly for various types of law enforcement officers.

===Federal marshals===
====United States Marshals Service====
The federal court system in the United States has 94 federal judicial districts, each with a court (with one or more judges), a United States Attorney with assistants such as prosecutors and government lawyers and a marshal, appointed by the president, in charge of federal law enforcement. The courts are part of the independent judicial branch of the government, while the marshals and U.S. attorneys are part of the Department of Justice in the executive branch. The U.S. marshal for the district primarily oversees court security and has a unit of appointed deputies and special deputies. (Other law enforcement operations and the federal prison system are handled by other federal police agencies.) The United States Marshals Service is a professional, civil service unit of federal police, part of the system of marshals, made up of career law enforcement personnel rather than the appointed district marshals. The U.S. Marshals Service assists with court security and prisoner transport, asset forfeiture, serves arrest warrants and seeks fugitives.

====Federal Air Marshal Service====
The Federal Air Marshal Service is a separate armed federal law enforcement service employed to protect commercial airliners from the threat of aircraft hijacking. These air marshals work for the Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

====Marshal of the United States Supreme Court====
The U.S. Supreme Court maintains its own, separate Marshal of the United States Supreme Court, who also controls the U.S. Supreme Court Police, a security police service answerable to the court itself, rather than to the president or attorney general. It handles security for the Supreme Court building and for the justices personally, and undertakes whatever other missions the court may require or assign.

===State and local marshals===

In many U.S. states, marshals can be found acting at the state, local or municipal level; marshals can be court bailiffs or process servers, or even fully sworn police officers. In some states, they may be sworn peace officers, however their job is, in certain cases, entirely civil rather than criminal law enforcement. In other states, some communities maintain a Town or City Marshal who is responsible for all general law enforcement within the respective jurisdiction, as well as court duties, while others are strictly court officers. This is especially true in communities with both police and marshals. The position of marshal vastly differs from state to state. At least one local railroad servicing company&#x27;s part-time public safety staff, which are both fire and police trained, is supervised by a chief marshal.

American Old West (for example, Arizona Territory and Texas of the 1880s): Marshals, usually called &quot;town marshals&quot; or &quot;city marshals&quot; (since the larger cities were often punctilious about their titles), were appointed or elected police officers of small communities, with powers and duties similar to those of a police chief; these powers generally ended at the border of the community. By contrast, federal marshals (U.S. marshals) worked in a larger territory, especially in pioneer country, and this area could potentially overlap with the state or territorial office of county sheriff (who then, as now, policed communities, as well as areas between communities). The word &quot;marshal&quot; is still used in this sense, especially in the American Southwest. (&quot;See&quot; List of Western lawmen.) Town or city marshal is still the name for the head officer of some community police forces.

Arizona: Cities and towns decide whether to appoint or elect a marshal, or have the board, council, or city manager hire a chief of police as the top criminal law enforcement official for their jurisdiction (as in the town of Tombstone). Marshals are elected by the trustees to serve a fixed term, and chiefs of police can be fired at will by whoever hired them, just like any other employee.

California: Several urban counties (including Los Angeles, San Bernardino County, California, and San Diego) once maintained separate county marshal&#x27;s offices, which served as court officers similar to U.S. marshals or constables, but mainly for the municipal court system. This system was abolished by state law in 2000, when the sheriffs of those counties announced that those counties&#x27; marshals would be absorbed into their departments. Therefore, many have been merged into or taken over by the local county sheriff&#x27;s office, with the exceptions of Shasta County and Trinity County both located in Northern California. As of 2010, the marshal of San Benito County has been disbanded as an independent organization, with its employees becoming part of the sheriff&#x27;s office. California also has fire marshals and deputy fire marshals, who may work for the State of California Fire Marshal&#x27;s Office, or various county, city or special districts throughout the state. Fire marshals and deputy fire marshals are full-time sworn peace officers throughout the state, with powers of arrest statewide under section 830.37 of the California Penal Code. Their responsibilities include fire and arson investigation, bomb and explosives investigation, general law enforcement, as well as enforcement of the fire code.

Colorado: Cities, towns and villages decide whether to appoint or elect a marshal, or have the board, council, or city manager hire a chief of police as the top criminal law enforcement for their jurisdiction. Marshals are elected by the trustees to serve a fixed term, and chiefs of police can be fired at will by whoever hired them, just like any other employee.

Connecticut: In 2000, Connecticut eliminated the county sheriff system, and replaced it with two types of marshals. &quot;State&quot; marshals operate out of the executive branch of state government. They are sworn peace officers who perform a wide range of duties, including service of process, seizing money and property under court order, evictions, serving tax warrants, and arresting individuals on bench warrants. &quot;Judicial&quot; marshals are employed by the judicial branch. They are sworn peace officers who perform court security and transport detainees to and from court.

Georgia: The marshal is a commissioned armed and uniformed law enforcement officer of the county state courts which have jurisdiction over civil matters and state ordinances. In the Atlanta metro counties, marshal&#x27;s offices enforce evictions, foreclosures, subpoenas, civil forfeitures, judgements, seizure, liens, repossession, and garnishment. With a few exceptions, elsewhere in Georgia, the sheriff&#x27;s office is responsible for enforcement of these duties, with some sheriffs&#x27; offices having an assigned unit or personnel for these duties.

Indiana: Indiana Town Marshals are fully-sworn, ILEA certified police officers who act as the chief police officer of a town. General police terms in Indiana vary by what local government one works for; for example: counties have Sheriff&#x27;s/deputies, cities have Police Departments/Officers and Towns have Marshals/deputies. In Indiana, a town is managed by a council without an elected mayor, whereas a city has a mayor and, thus, a city police department. Marshals are responsible for all law enforcement in their respective town, and their primary duties are the enforcement of local and state laws or ordinances as well as code enforcement. The Town Marshal may also be the town&#x27;s humane law enforcement officer. Town marshals are fully sworn state certified police officers though the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy, having law enforcement authority statewide; therefore, it is not at all uncommon for Town Marshals to be seen outside of their bailiwicks assisting other police agencies. Some town marshal agencies in Indiana can be quite large. A Town Marshal can appoint any number of unpaid deputy town marshals or reserve officers who may exercise full police powers in the state. Indiana Town Marshals are authorized to enforce not only city/town code, but also county ordinances; this differs from city police departments where a city police officer may only enforce city code or a sheriff&#x27;s deputy, who may only enforce county code. Indiana Code recognizes Town Marshals as Police Officers, therefore it is very common for Indiana Town Marshal&#x27;s Offices to go simply by &quot;Police Department&quot; .

Under Indiana Code IC36-5-7 the marshal is described as &quot;the chief police officer of the town and has the powers of other law enforcement officers in executing the orders of the legislative body and enforcing laws. The marshal or his deputy:
# shall serve all process directed to him by the town court or legislative body;
# shall arrest without process all persons who commit an offense within his view, take them before a court having jurisdiction, and detain them in custody until the cause of the arrest has been investigated;
# shall suppress breaches of the peace;
# may, if necessary, call the power of the town to his aid;
# may execute search warrants and arrest warrants; and
# may pursue and jail persons who commit an offense.&quot;

Maine: The State Marshal Service provides physical security and law enforcement duties to the judicial system, as well as protection of all state judges. Deputy marshals are fully sworn state law enforcement officers with statewide authority.

Missouri: There are two types of marshal:
:State marshals provide physical security and law enforcement duties to the judicial system, as well as protection of all state judges. Deputy marshals are fully sworn state law enforcement officers with statewide authority.
:City marshals, at the local level in the State of Missouri, are elected chief law enforcement officers of a city. They have the same police powers as a regular police officer within the city limits. The amount of training to be a city marshal is far less than a regular municipal police officer; as such, a marshal&#x27;s jurisdiction is strictly limited to the city limits of the city to which they are elected. Even if they witness a violation of the law in their city, they cannot pursue a person who flees beyond the city limits. The position of city marshal is rare in the state of Missouri and is only found in very small rural cities that do not have the budget to maintain a police department.
:City marshals and deputy city marshals have, by law, the same authority as a municipal (town or city) police officer. However, those municipalities, such as Las Vegas, that have both a police force as well as a city marshal&#x27;s office, often utilize the police as the general law enforcement agency of the municipality, while public property security and misdemeanor detention services are provided by the city marshal&#x27;s office. In municipalities that do not have a police department, the county sheriff&#x27;s office would serve as the agency that provides general law enforcement services to residents.
::Las Vegas has two types of marshal:
:::Municipal court marshals who serve the municipal court by serving warrants and subpoenas and to make arrests for offenses under the jurisdiction of the municipal court; and to maintain order in the court and escort personnel to court and jail.
:::City marshals who provide law enforcement services to city employees, residents and tourists utilizing city facilities located within the city limits, specifically those located on property owned, leased, operated or otherwise under the control of the city of Las Vegas. Conduct special operations aimed at reducing certain criminal activity in specific areas of the city, for example, traffic enforcement in neighborhoods, abatement of illegal solicitors at intersections and the removal of abandoned vehicles. Conducting security and safety evaluations requested by city departments at various facilities, buildings and workplaces.
::Henderson has Marshals as well:
::Municipal Court Marshals work for the courts by serving warrants and to make arrests for offenses under the jurisdiction of the municipal court; and to maintain order in the court and escort personnel to court and jail.

New York: There are two levels of marshals:
:City marshals are the elected chief law enforcement officers of a city or town. They have the same police powers as a regular police officer within the city limits. The amount of training to be a city marshal is far less than for a regular municipal police officer; as such a marshal&#x27;s jurisdiction is strictly limited to the city limits of the city to which they are elected. Even if they witness a violation of the law in their city, they cannot pursue a person who flees beyond the city limits. The position of city marshal is rare in the State of New York and is now only found in very small rural cities that do not have the budget to maintain a police department.
:New York City Marshals are appointed by the Mayor of New York City to five-year terms, but receive no salary from the city. The city&#x27;s statutes specify that no more than 83 city marshals shall be appointed by a mayor. Marshals primarily enforce orders from civil court cases, including collecting on judgments, towing, seizing utility meters and carrying out evictions. Marshals collectively perform approximately 25,000 evictions per year. They are regulated by the NYC Department of Investigation but, unlike the city sheriff, they are not city employees. Marshals collect fees, which are set by statute, from private litigants when they are called on to enforce judgments, and they also retain five percent of any money they collect on judgments. City marshals may, depending on the court order brought to them by the winning litigant, seize money, movable property (for instance, inventory from a business), vehicles; as is the case with unpaid parking tickets, and return possession of rental premises to the landlord, (also known as eviction), and more. On an annual basis city marshals must pay the City of New York $1,500 plus 4.5 percent of the fees they receive for collecting judgments.

Ohio: The term &quot;village marshal&quot; has been used for the same function, often filled without colleagues, directly under the mayor.

Texas: City marshals and deputy city marshals have, by law, the same authority as a municipal (village, town, or city) police officer. However, municipalities (like Fort Worth), that have both a police force as well as a city marshal&#x27;s office, often utilize the police as the general law enforcement agency of the municipality, while court security and process service is provided by the city marshal&#x27;s office. In municipalities that do not have a police department, the city marshal&#x27;s office sometimes serves as the agency that provides general law enforcement services to residents.

Washington State: The city of Seattle employs marshals in their municipal court, with the senior officer holding the title of chief marshal and the subordinate officers known as deputy marshals. Seattle Marshals provide court security and law enforcement services within the court. They handle arrests of out-of-custody defendants within the courthouse and transport in custody defendants to and from court hearings. The King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (county seat in Seattle) also employs court marshals, which is a unit under the sheriff&#x27;s office. In the Old-West themed town of Winthrop, the municipal police force is headed by a town marshal, consistent with the Old West restoration of the buildings and tourist attractions.

Wisconsin:The village marshal shall execute and file an official bond. The marshal shall possess the powers, enjoy the privileges and be subject to the liabilities conferred and imposed by law upon constables, and be taken as included in all writs and papers addressed to constables. The marshal shall obey all lawful written orders of the village board. The marshal is entitled to the same fees prescribed for sheriffs in s. 814.70 for similar services, unless a higher fee is applicable under s. 814.705 (1) (c); for other service rendered the village, compensation as the board fixes.

61.28(2) (2) A village marshal who is given law enforcement duties by the village board, and who meets the definition of a law enforcement officer under s. 165.85 (2) (c), shall comply with the minimum employment standards for law enforcement officers established by the law enforcement standards board and shall complete training under s. 165.85 (4) (a) 1. .

==United Kingdom==

===England===
The hereditary title of &quot;marshal&quot; at one time designated the head of household security for the King of England. William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, served four kings in this office, ultimately becoming one of the most powerful men in Europe; by the time he died in 1219, people throughout Europe (not just England) referred to William Marshal simply as &quot;the marshal&quot;. The office of hereditary Marshal (or Earl Marshal) thus evolved into that of a Great Officer of State.

The task of maintaining law and order within the king&#x27;s court then devolved upon the office of Knight Marshal (established in 1236). Together with his officers, the King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Marshalmen, the Knight Marshal continued to have restricted powers of arrest within a radius of the sovereign&#x27;s palace until 1846, when the office was abolished.

In 1595, Queen Elizabeth I issued letters patent giving powers to a marshal to maintain order within the City of London. Later, an under-marshal and six city marshalmen were appointed to assist the marshal in his duties. As a result of the Police Acts of 1829 and 1839, the marshal&#x27;s role changed significantly. , one city marshal, currently Colonel Billy King-Harman, CBE, still acts as peacekeeper to the Lord Mayor of London, leading processions and representing the Lord Mayor at all Entries of Troops (challenging and then escorting those few regiments entitled to march though the City of London).

===Scotland===
The office of &quot;Marischal of Scotland&quot; (&quot;marascallus Scotie&quot; or &quot;marscallus Scotie&quot;) had been held heritably by the senior member of the Keith family since Hervey de Keith, who held the office of marischal under Malcolm IV and William I. The descendant of Herveus, Sir Robert de Keith (d. 1332), was confirmed in the office of &quot;Great Marischal of Scotland&quot; by Robert Bruce around 1324.

Robert de Keith&#x27;s great-grandson, William, was raised to the peerage as Earl Marischal by James II in about 1458. The peerage died out when George Keith, the 10th Earl, forfeited it by joining the Jacobite Rising of 1715.

The marischal was to serve as custodian of the Royal Regalia of Scotland, and protect the king&#x27;s person when attending parliament. The former duty was fulfilled by the 7th Earl during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, who hid the Royal Regalia at Dunnottar Castle. The role of regulation of heraldry carried out by the English Earl Marshal is carried out in Scotland by the Lord Lyon King of Arms.

The separate office of Knight Marischal was first created for the Scottish coronation of Charles I in 1633. The office is not heritable, although it has been held by members of the Keith family.

==France==

In France, the &quot;Maréchaussée&quot; (&quot;Marshalcy&quot;) was the forerunner of the French &quot;Gendarmerie&quot;. A military corps having such duties was first created in 1337, placed under the command of the Constable of France (the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armed Forces), and named the &quot;Connétablie&quot;. In 1627 after the abolition of the title of &quot;Connétable&quot;, it was put under the command of the &quot;Marshals of France,&quot; and renamed the &quot;Maréchaussée&quot;. Its main mission was to protect the roads from highwaymen.

The &quot;Maréchaussée&quot; was a mounted military police force organised and equipped along military lines. The force wore uniforms similar to those of the dragoons of the regular army and carried the same muskets and sabres. While its existence ensured the relative safety of French rural districts and roads, the &quot;Maréchaussée&quot; was regarded in contemporary England (which had no effective police force of any nature) as a symbol of foreign tyranny.

In 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, the &quot;Maréchaussée&quot; numbered 3,660 men divided into small detachments called brigades. By law dated 16 February 1791, this force was renamed the &quot;Gendarmerie Nationale,&quot; though at first its personnel remained unchanged. Later many of them died under the guillotine, especially the members of the nobility.

The new designation &quot;Gendarmerie&quot; was derived from the term &quot;gens d&#x27;armes&quot; (gentlemen/people at arms) who were originally heavy cavalry regiments (called at first &quot;Ordonnances royales&quot;) which were part of the King&#x27;s household, the equivalent of the English &quot;Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms&quot;.

The title &quot;Marshal of France&quot; is a &quot;Dignité d&#x27;État&quot; (&quot;State Dignity&quot;) in the contemporary French Republic, not only a military rank. It is granted to generals for exceptional achievements, especially in times of war or national crisis.

However, the Marshal of France was one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France during the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; and Bourbon Restoration and one of the Great Dignitaries of the Empire during the First French Empire and the Second French Empire (when the title was not &quot;Marshal of France&quot; but &quot;Marshal of the Empire&quot;)

A Marshal of France displays seven stars and is equivalent to a six star general in armies of other countries. The marshal also receives a baton, a blue cylinder with stars, formerly fleurs-de-lis during the monarchy and Eagles during the First French Empire and Second French Empire. It has the Latin inscription: &quot;Terror belli, decus pacis&quot;, which means &quot;terror in war, ornament in peace&quot;.

The position in the French Navy (&quot;Marine nationale&quot;) equivalent to the &quot;Marshal of France&quot; is called &quot;Amiral de France&quot; (&quot;Admiral of France&quot;). The title has not been conferred since 1869. Theoretically, the equivalent title in the French Air Force is &quot;Général de France&quot; (&quot;General of France&quot;), but it has never been conferred to anyone yet.

Six Marshals of France have been given the even more prestigious rank of &quot;Marshal General of the King&#x27;s Armies and Camps&quot;: Biron, Lesdiguières, Turenne, Villars, Saxe, and Soult. This rank and title no longer exists in present-day republican France.

==Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, the &quot;Koninklijke Marechaussee&quot; are the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; force created by King William I to replace the French &quot;gendarmerie&quot; on October 26, 1814. The word &quot;gendarmerie&quot; had gained a negative connotation, so William called the new force &quot;marechaussée&quot; (an alternate French word for &quot;gendarmerie&quot;). At that time, the &quot;marechaussee&quot; was part of the army (&quot;landmacht&quot;). The &quot;marechaussee&quot; performed police duties for the army, as well as civilian police work as a part of the national police (&quot;rijkspolitie&quot;). The &quot;marechaussee&quot; formed the only police force in many small cities like Venlo, especially in the southern provinces of Limburg and North Brabant. As of 1998, the &quot;marechaussee&quot; is a separate branch of the Dutch military, and is assigned both military and civilian police tasks.

<text>Robert Semple (21 October 1873 – 31 January 1955) was a union leader and later Minister of Public Works for the first Labour Government of New Zealand. He is also known for creating the Bob Semple tank.

==Early life==
He was born in Sofala, New South Wales, Australia. He started working at an early age as gold miner in Australia. In 1903 he was involved in a miner&#x27;s strike in Victoria, Australia. The strike was defeated and Semple ended up being blacklisted.

To avoid the blacklist Semple moved to the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. By 1907 he was president of the Runanga Miner&#x27;s Union and earned himself nickname &#x27;Fighting Bob Semple&#x27;.

He was jailed in 1913 for supporting the general strike and again in 1916 after fighting conscription for overseas service during World War I. Semple served as the President of the Labour Party from 1926 to 1928.

Semple was a member of the Wellington City Council for a decade between 1925 and 1935. In 1935 he unsuccessfully stood for Mayor of Wellington, coming runner-up to Thomas Hislop. His wife Margaret was also a Wellington City Councillor from 1938 to 1941.

== Parliamentary career ==





Semple was elected to the seat of Wellington South Parliament for Labour in a 1918 by-election, but lost the seat in the 1919 general election. In 1928 he won the Wellington East seat, and held it until 1946, when it was renamed Miramar. He then held Miramar until 1954, when he retired.

In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Semple was a prolific user of &quot;unparliamentary language&quot; during his time as an MP, and was fond of insulting colleagues by calling or comparing them to Australian animals such as kookaburras, kangaroos and dingoes.

During his term in Parliament, Semple held many important infrastructure portfolios, such as Minister of Public Works (1935–1941, 1942–1943) and Minister of Railways (1941–1949). Semple was seen by many as the public face of the first Labour government&#x27;s infrastructure investment. He reshaped the Public Works Department by resuming its original function as the development arm of the government by phasing out its focus on relief work from the Great Depression. 

During World War II he had built the &#x27;Bob Semple tank&#x27;, made from corrugated iron and a tractor base. The tank had numerous design flaws and other practical problems and was never put into production. In later life, he became an ardent anti-communist. He did not seek re-election in the 1954 election, and died in New Plymouth in January 1955.

<text>Jerry Fulton Cantrell Jr. (born March 18, 1966) is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is best known as the founder, lead guitarist, co-lead vocalist, and main songwriter of the rock band Alice in Chains. The band rose to international fame in the early 1990s during Seattle&#x27;s grunge movement and is known for its distinctive vocal style and the harmonized vocals between Cantrell and Layne Staley (and later Cantrell and William DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on Alice in Chains&#x27; 1992 EP &quot;Sap&quot;. After Staley&#x27;s death in 2002, Cantrell took the role of Alice in Chains&#x27; lead singer on most of the songs from the band&#x27;s post-Staley albums, &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; (2009), &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot; (2013), and &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; (2018), with DuVall harmonizing with him in the new songs and singing Staley&#x27;s vocals in the old songs in live concerts.

He also has a solo career and released the albums &quot;Boggy Depot&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Degradation Trip Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot; in 2002. His third solo album, &quot;Brighten&quot;, was released in 2021. His most recent release is 2024&#x27;s &quot;I Want Blood&quot;. Cantrell has also collaborated and performed with Heart, Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Pantera, Circus of Power, Metal Church, Gov&#x27;t Mule, Damageplan, Pearl Jam, the Cult, Stone Temple Pilots, Danzig, Glenn Hughes, Duff McKagan, and Deftones, among others.

Cantrell was named &quot;Riff Lord&quot; by British hard rock/metal magazine &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; in 2006. &quot;Guitar World&quot; Magazine ranked Cantrell as the 38th out of &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2004, and the 37th &quot;Greatest Guitar Player of All Time&quot; in 2012. &quot;Guitar World&quot; also ranked Cantrell&#x27;s solo in &quot;Man in the Box&quot; at No. 77 on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot; in 2008. Cantrell has earned nine Grammy Award nominations as a member of Alice in Chains.

He also contributed to the soundtracks of &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996), &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot; (2017), and &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; (2018), and he has made cameos in films such as &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), &quot;Rock Slyde&quot; (2009), and &quot;&quot; (2019). Cantrell also acted in the Alice in Chains mockumentaries &quot;The Nona Tapes&quot; (1995) and &quot;AIC 23&quot; (2013).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Cantrell was born in Tacoma, Washington, on March 18, 1966, to Gloria Jean Krumpos and Jerry Fulton Cantrell. He grew up in Spanaway, and is the oldest of three children. His father is an Army veteran, and his mother was an amateur organist and melodica player who worked as an administrative assistant for the Clover Park School District in Pierce County, Washington. His maternal grandmother was from Norway, and his maternal grandfather was from the Czech Republic.

After Cantrell learned to write, he documented his goal on Dr. Seuss&#x27; book, &quot;My Book About Me&quot;, filling in the sentence &quot;When I grow up I want to be a...&quot; with the words &quot;rock star&quot;.

Cantrell&#x27;s father, Jerry Sr., is a combat veteran of the Vietnam War. Cantrell&#x27;s first childhood memory is meeting his father for the first time after he had returned from war when he was three years old. Due to the strain of war, his parents divorced when he was seven years old, and Cantrell was raised by his mother, Gloria, and his maternal grandmother in Tacoma. The family lived on welfare and food stamps. Jerry Sr. was the main subject of the song &quot;Rooster&quot;, which Cantrell wrote as a tribute to his father, and his mother Gloria is also mentioned by name in the song. Father and son also appeared together on the music video for &quot;Rooster&quot;, in which Jerry Sr. recalls the war. Cantrell would later name his music publishing company as &quot;Rooster&#x27;s Son Publishing&quot;.

Cantrell and his mother moved back to Spanaway where he attended junior high. His first job was delivering newspapers.
Cantrell attended high school at Spanaway Lake High School, and, before owning his first guitar, he was a member of the high school choir which attended many state competitions. In his senior year, Cantrell became choir president, and the quartet sang the national anthem at basketball games and won competitions with the highest marks achievable. Cantrell has cited his interest in dark musical tones as dating back to this period: &quot;In choir we performed a cappella Gregorian chants from the 14th and 15th centuries. It was scary church music.&quot; His choir teacher and drama teacher were, early on, his two greatest motivators toward a career in music. When Alice in Chains&#x27; first album went gold, Cantrell sent both teachers a gold record. He graduated from high school in 1984.

Cantrell picked up a guitar for the first time when he was in sixth grade. At that time he played clarinet, and his mother was dating a guitar player who handed his guitar to Cantrell and taught him a couple of chords. Cantrell picked it up very quickly, impressing his mother&#x27;s boyfriend who suggested that she should buy her son a guitar, so she bought him an acoustic guitar. It would not be until the age of 17 that he began seriously playing an electric guitar. Cantrell learned to play guitar by ear, emulating his heroes. In his mid-teens he bought his first guitar from a swap meet, a Korean-made Fender Stratocaster.

His maternal grandmother, Dorothy Krumpos, died of cancer in October 1986, and his mother Gloria died of pancreatic cancer at age 43 in April 1987, when Cantrell was 21 years old. Friends recalled that Cantrell fell into depression and became a completely different person after losing both his mother and grandmother within a short span of time.

The first album that Cantrell owned was Elton John&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, which was a gift he received from his father when he was 10 years old. He noted in an interview that he was &quot;raised on country music&quot; as a youth and that he admires the emotion conveyed in the genre. He also considers himself &quot;half Yankee and half redneck&quot;. However, hard rock music caught Cantrell&#x27;s interest predominantly. He would later cite guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix, Ace Frehley, Tony Iommi, Angus Young, Jimmy Page, Glenn Tipton, K.K. Downing, David Gilmour, Nancy Wilson, and Eddie Van Halen as major influences, as well as Elton John and bands Fleetwood Mac, Heart and Rush as his early songwriting idols. Cantrell also cited Soundgarden as a big influence on him.

===Early career===

In 1985, Cantrell was attending college during the Winter Semester, but he decided to quit it and moved to Dallas, Texas, to join a band with a couple of friends. Cantrell worked doing asbestos abatement around the Dallas and Houston areas. He also worked at the music store Arnold and Morgan Music Company. While working at the store, Cantrell bought what he described as his first &quot;real guitar&quot;, a 1984 G&amp;L Rampage. During that time, he had a band with Vinnie Chas (from Pretty Boy Floyd), called Sinister. Later they formed another band called Raze.

While living in Dallas, Cantrell met an early incarnation of the band Pantera and started a long friendship with brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul.

In 1985 or 1986, Cantrell moved back to Tacoma and began a band called Diamond Lie, which included singer Scott Damon, drummer Bobby Nesbitt and bassist Matt Muasau. The band started playing concerts in Tacoma and Seattle with the goal of getting a record deal. They recorded a four-song demo at London Bridge Studio.

When Cantrell was 20 years old, he was working several part-time jobs to pay his rent, one of which involved throwing boxes of frozen fish in a warehouse. He spent his time outside of work playing guitar and jamming with any band he could find.

Three weeks after his mother&#x27;s death on April 11, 1987, Cantrell went to see the band Alice N&#x27; Chains perform at the Tacoma Little Theatre, and was impressed by the voice of the lead singer, Layne Staley. Diamond Lie played their last concert in July 1987.

Cantrell met Layne Staley, then Alice N&#x27; Chains&#x27; lead singer, at a party in Seattle around August 1987. He was homeless after being kicked out of his family&#x27;s house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the 24-hour rehearsal studio &quot;The Music Bank&quot;. Shortly after Cantrell moved in with Staley at the Music Bank, Alice &#x27;N Chains broke up.

Cantrell wanted to form a new band and Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell&#x27;s demos. Cantrell mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney pointed at his girlfriend and said: &quot;that&#x27;s weird cause that&#x27;s his sister&quot;. Kinney called Starr and a few days later they started jamming with Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn&#x27;t have a singer.

Staley was already starting up another band, but Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted him to be their lead singer. They started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Staley, who was Cantrell&#x27;s roommate at the time, agreed to join on the condition that Cantrell join his funk project (which ended shortly after), and Staley joined Cantrell&#x27;s band on a full-time basis. The band had names like &quot;Mothra&quot;, &quot;Fuck&quot; and &quot;Diamond Lie&quot;, the latter being the name of Cantrell&#x27;s previous band. Diamond Lie gained attention in the Seattle area and eventually took the name of Staley&#x27;s previous band, &quot;Alice N&#x27; Chains&quot;, and was quickly renamed as Alice in Chains.

Cantrell attended a Guns N&#x27; Roses concert at the Seattle Center in 1988, and took an Alice in Chains demo tape to give to the band. He met Axl Rose after the show and gave him the tape. As he was walking away, Cantrell saw Rose throwing the demo away. Years later, Guns N&#x27; Roses chose Alice in Chains to be the opening act of their 2016 reunion tour.

Alice in Chains&#x27; final demo, &quot;The Treehouse Tapes&quot;, was completed in 1988 and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle bands Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden, respectively. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records. After three months of negotiations, Alice in Chains signed to Columbia Records on September 11, 1989.

===Alice in Chains===
====Layne Staley era (1987–2002)====

Jerry Cantrell served as the lead guitarist, co-lyricist, co-vocalist and main composer of Alice in Chains until the group&#x27;s near-permanent hiatus beginning in the late 1990s and leading through the death of lead singer Layne Staley in April 2002. Cantrell&#x27;s guitar contribution gave a heavy metal edge to the band&#x27;s unique grunge style. Cantrell also played bass on the track &quot;Love Song&quot;, from the 1992 &quot;Sap&quot; EP.

Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP &quot;Sap&quot;, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band. Cantrell stated that it was Staley who encouraged him to sing.

Although Alice in Chains has been labeled grunge by the mainstream media, Cantrell identifies the band as primarily heavy metal. He told &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1996, &quot;We&#x27;re a lot of different things ... I don&#x27;t quite know what the mixture is, but there&#x27;s definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to&quot;.

Alice in Chains was one of the most successful bands of the 1990s, selling over 20 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone. Their debut album, &quot;Facelift&quot;, was released in 1990 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA, selling over two million copies. Cantrell dedicated the album to his late mother Gloria and to his close friend Andrew Wood, lead singer of the band Mother Love Bone who died in 1990. Speaking with &quot;Spin&quot; magazine in January 1991, Cantrell confirmed that the song &quot;Sunshine&quot; from &quot;Facelift&quot; was written about his mother&#x27;s death. &quot;When I was a little kid, I&#x27;d always tell her, &quot;I&#x27;ll be famous and buy you a house and you&#x27;ll never have to work again. I&#x27;ll take care of you like you took care of me.&#x27; When she passed away, it was a really shitty time for me. I didn&#x27;t know how to deal with it then, and I still don&#x27;t. But it gave me the impetus to do what I&#x27;m doing.&quot;

In February 1992, the band released the acoustic EP &quot;Sap&quot;. The EP has been certified gold, and it features guest vocals by Ann Wilson from the band Heart, who joined Cantrell for the chorus of &quot;Brother&quot;, and Staley for the chorus of &quot;Am I Inside&quot;. The EP also features Mark Arm of Mudhoney and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, who appeared together on the song &quot;Right Turn&quot;, credited as &quot;Alice Mudgarden&quot; in the liner notes. The opening track, &quot;Brother&quot;, featured Cantrell on lead vocals. The song was about Cantrell&#x27;s relationship with his younger brother, David. Cantrell also played bass on the last track, &quot;Love Song&quot;.

Their second full-length album, &quot;Dirt&quot;, was released in September 1992 to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Would?&quot;, was written by Cantrell as a tribute to his late friend Andrew Wood. The song was also featured on the soundtrack to Cameron Crowe&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Singles&quot;. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Rooster&quot;, was a tribute to Cantrell&#x27;s father.

Alice in Chains&#x27; second acoustic EP, &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;, debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in 1994, becoming the first ever EP and first Alice in Chains release to top the charts. It has been certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The album&#x27;s fifth track was an instrumental song, &quot;Whale &amp; Wasp&quot;, described by Cantrell as &quot;a conversation between whales and wasps&quot;.

Alice in Chains broke up for six months following the cancellation of their opening act at the Metallica tour in July 1994, citing &quot;health problems within the band&quot;. The band&#x27;s self-titled third studio album was released in November 1995, debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and has been certified double platinum. The singles &quot;Grind&quot;, &quot;Over Now&quot;, and &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; feature Cantrell on lead vocals. The band did not tour in support of their self-titled album.

On April 10, 1996, Alice in Chains played their first concert in two and a half years for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, a program featuring all-acoustic set lists. The show featured some of the band&#x27;s highest charting singles, including &quot;Rooster&quot;, &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, &quot;No Excuses&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot;, and introduced a new song, &quot;Killer Is Me&quot;, with Cantrell on lead vocals. Cantrell stated that he was ill during the performance as a result of food poisoning from a hot dog consumed before the gig.

Alice in Chains performed four shows supporting Kiss on their Alive/Worldwide Tour in 1996, including the final live appearance of Layne Staley on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was hospitalized. Staley rarely left his condo in Seattle, but in 1998 the band reunited to record two new songs, &quot;Get Born Again&quot; and &quot;Died&quot;, originally intended for Cantrell&#x27;s second solo album, the songs were released on the 1999 box set &quot;Music Bank&quot;. Still in 1999, the band released a 15-track compilation titled &quot;Nothing Safe: Best of the Box&quot;. Their first compilation, titled &quot;Live&quot;, was released on December 5, 2000. In 2001, a second compilation titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released.

====Reunion and new albums (2005–present)====
Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley&#x27;s substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reformed in 2005 when drummer Sean Kinney had the idea to reunite the surviving members to perform a benefit concert for the victims of the tsunami disaster that struck South Asia in 2004. On February 18, 2005, Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reunited to perform for the first time in 10 years as Alice in Chains at the &quot;K-Rock Tsunami Continued Care Relief Concert&quot; in Seattle. The band featured Damageplan vocalist Pat Lachman, as well as other special guests including Maynard James Keenan of Tool, Wes Scantlin from Puddle of Mudd and Ann Wilson of Heart. A few months after that concert, the band called their former manager Susan Silver and Cantrell&#x27;s manager Bill Siddons and said they wanted to tour as Alice in Chains again.

On March 10, 2006, Cantrell, Inez and Kinney performed at VH1&#x27;s Decades Rock Live concert, honoring fellow Seattle musicians Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart. They played &quot;Would?&quot; with vocalist Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down and bass player Duff McKagan of Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver, then they played &quot;Rooster&quot; with Ann Wilson and Comes with the Fall vocalist William DuVall. The band followed the concert with a short United States club tour, several festival dates in Europe, and a brief tour in Japan. To coincide with the band&#x27;s reunion, Sony Music released the long-delayed third Alice in Chains compilation, &quot;The Essential Alice in Chains&quot;, a double album that includes 28 songs.

Between 2006 and 2007, Cantrell played in a number of concerts with Alice in Chains featuring guest lead singers such as Ann Wilson, Mark Lanegan, James Hetfield, Phil Anselmo, Billy Corgan, Scott Weiland Sebastian Bach, and William DuVall. Although Cantrell acknowledges the benefits of working as a solo artist, he expressed his happiness with being back in the band culture.

Cantrell explained the band&#x27;s reunion saying, &quot;We want to celebrate what we did and the memory of our friend. We have played with some [singers] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We&#x27;re not interested in stepping on [Staley&#x27;s] rich legacy. It&#x27;s a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That&#x27;s the approach we&#x27;ve taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We&#x27;re willing to take a chance on it. It&#x27;s completely a reunion because the three of us who&#x27;re left are back together. But it&#x27;s not about separating and forgetting — it&#x27;s about remembering and moving on.&quot;

Cantrell met singer William DuVall in Los Angeles in 2000, through a mutual acquaintance who introduced him to 
the first album of DuVall&#x27;s band, Comes with the Fall. Cantrell started hanging out with the band and occasionally joining them onstage. Comes with the Fall was both the opening act on Cantrell&#x27;s tour for his second solo album, &quot;Degradation Trip&quot;, and also the singer&#x27;s backing band, with DuVall singing Staley&#x27;s parts at the concerts in 2001 and 2002. DuVall joined Alice in Chains as full-time lead singer during the band&#x27;s reunion tour in 2006, after making his first public appearance with the band at the VH1 concert.

By April 2007, Alice in Chains had been writing and demoing songs for a new album with DuVall, but the band did not show further signs of progress until October 2008, when they announced that they had begun recording with producer Nick Raskulinecz in the studio. The band didn&#x27;t have a record label at the time and the album was funded by Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney. The writing and recording process was completed on March 18, 2009 – Cantrell&#x27;s 43rd birthday and also the same day that DuVall&#x27;s son was born.

About the pressure being put on DuVall for replacing Staley as lead vocalist, Cantrell said, &quot;To put all that weight on Will&#x27;s shoulders is unfair. We&#x27;re just figuring out how we work as a team. Although the band has changed, we&#x27;ve lost Layne, we&#x27;ve added Will, and there was no master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It&#x27;s more than just making music, and it always has been. We&#x27;ve been friends a long time. We&#x27;ve been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here&quot;, Cantrell said pointing to his heart.

On September 29, 2009, Alice in Chains released their first record since the death of Layne Staley, &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot;, and toured in support of the album. The album includes songs which Cantrell described as &quot;the heaviest he&#x27;s ever written&quot;, and has Cantrell singing lead vocals on most of the songs and William DuVall as co-lead vocalist. The title track is a tribute to Layne Staley written and sung by Cantrell, accompanied by Elton John playing piano. In the months before writing the song, Cantrell had been suffering from an unexplained illness. Cantrell believes the mystery illness was the pain of saying goodbye to Staley. He told &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;I got deathly ill. I had these mystery migraines, intense physical pain, and I&#x27;d even gotten a spinal tap to test for certain things. They never could find anything wrong with me. I felt I was puking up all this undigested grief in losing Layne.&quot; Once Cantrell started writing the song and the rest of the album, his mystery illness disappeared. Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney also thanked Staley in the album&#x27;s liner notes. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in May 2010, 
selling over 500,000 copies in the U.S.

The band released their fifth studio album, &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot;, on May 28, 2013, and Cantrell continued his role of main singer in the album. The album debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (the band&#x27;s highest chart position since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, which debuted at No. 1), selling 61,000 copies in its first week of release.

In June 2017, Alice in Chains returned to Seattle&#x27;s Studio X to record their sixth studio album. Studio X was the same studio where the band recorded their self-titled album, &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; (1995), Recording was completed in January 2018. On June 27, 2018, the band announced the title and unveiled the cover art of the new album, &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;, released on August 24, 2018, through BMG, Alice in Chains&#x27; first release on the label. Cantrell took the album&#x27;s title from the Mount Rainier in Seattle, and the title track is a tribute to the Seattle music scene.

As part of the promotion of &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;, the baseball team Seattle Mariners hosted an &quot;Alice in Chains Night&quot; at the Safeco Field in Seattle on August 20, 2018, and Cantrell threw out the ceremonial first pitch and delivered a strike before the Mariners vs. Houston Astros game.

As of 2018, Alice in Chains has had 18 Top 10 songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, 5 No. 1 hits, and eleven Grammy Award nominations.

===Solo career: &quot;Boggy Depot&quot;, &quot;Degradation Trip&quot;, &quot;Brighten&quot; and &quot;I Want Blood&quot; (1996–present)===
Cantrell&#x27;s career outside Alice in Chains has consisted of four solo albums, as well as many appearances with other musicians and on film soundtracks. His first solo material was the song &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, released exclusively on &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; soundtrack in 1996, featuring Alice in Chains drummer Sean Kinney on drums and Cantrell on lead vocals, guitar and bass. It had a music video, which was included as a bonus feature on the 15th anniversary edition Blu-Ray of &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; in 2011, and the song reached No. 14 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks. In the same year, Cantrell covered Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen All This World I Care to See&quot; for the album &quot;Twisted Willie: A Tribute to Willie Nelson&quot;. As the activity of Alice in Chains slowed and the band&#x27;s future came into question, Cantrell reluctantly began work on his first full-length solo record. While video footage from Cantrell&#x27;s official website claimed that he wanted to work solo for some time, his comments in &quot;Guitar World&quot; stated otherwise:

Cantrell&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Boggy Depot&quot;, was released on April 7, 1998, and published by Cantrell&#x27;s &quot;Boggy Bottom Publishing&quot; company. The title comes from the ghost town of the same name in Oklahoma, which is the area that Cantrell&#x27;s father grew up in. The album cover shows Cantrell covered in mud standing waist-deep in a branch of the Boggy River. Besides singing, Cantrell also played guitar, piano, clavinet, organ, and steel drums on the album. The tracks &quot;Cut You In&quot;, &quot;My Song&quot; and &quot;Dickeye&quot; were released as singles to promote the album. Cantrell&#x27;s father played the sheriff in the music video for &quot;Cut You In&quot;.

His touring band for the album included Alice in Chains bandmates Inez and Kinney, and Cantrell expressed hope to have a second album released by the following year. Cantrell opened for Metallica and Van Halen on their 1998 summer tour. The same year of &quot;Boggy Depot&quot;, Cantrell began writing a follow-up album. He also departed from Columbia Records during this time and had trouble finding a new label. Cantrell said of the writing experience:

In 1998, Layne Staley almost performed live again since Alice in Chains&#x27; last concert in July 1996, when Cantrell went to Seattle on his solo tour for &quot;Boggy Depot&quot;. It was Halloween night and Staley was backstage as a guest. Cantrell reportedly asked Staley to join him onstage, but Staley declined.

Cantrell started recording a follow-up to &quot;Boggy Depot&quot; in 2000. He was also living in San Francisco during that period. He had to sell his Seattle house to fund the album and produced it himself. Finally in June 2002, Cantrell issued his second solo album, &quot;Degradation Trip,&quot; with Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s then live rhythm section, Mike Bordin (drums) and Robert Trujillo (bass). Released on Roadrunner Records, &quot;Degradation Trip&quot; hit shelves two months after Layne Staley&#x27;s death and was dedicated to him. The songs on the album ranged from doom metal to pop-based hard rock. The album, which received better critical reception than its predecessor, featured two singles, &quot;Anger Rising&quot; and &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, and the track &quot;She Was My Girl&quot; was included on the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; soundtrack.

&quot;Degradation Trip&quot; has sold 100,000 copies in the U.S. as of December 2002. The live show was well received by audiences on a national tour that helped build upon the solo album&#x27;s success. &quot;Degradation Trip&quot; was re-released in November 2002 as a double album, featuring eleven additional tracks that were made for the album as Cantrell originally intended. In the Spring of 2004, Cantrell opened a slate of shows on Kid Rock&#x27;s U.S. tour.

Cantrell has been rumored to be working on his third full-length solo album for several years, for a supposedly planned release in 2006. However, this album was not released until 2021. Subsequent work with the revamped Alice in Chains may have stalled this release. When asked about releasing another solo album, he issued this statement in 2010:

In November 2014, during an interview on radio 95.5 KLOS, Cantrell was asked if he had any plans on doing more solo work, to which he replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t know. Maybe somewhere down the road. The only reason I ever did anything by my own was because my band wasn&#x27;t really doing anything. My band has been doing things lately, so I don&#x27;t really have time to do anything. I kinda focus my energy there [in the band]. Of course, you know, possibilities...&quot; Cantrell expressed the same sentiment when asked about a new solo album during an interview with Trunk Nation in August 2017, stating that Alice in Chains has always been his number one concern, but that he would not rule out a new solo album in the future.

In February 2017, Cantrell released his first solo song in 15 years, &quot;A Job to Do&quot;, featured during the end credits of the movie &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot;. On February 6, 2019, Cantrell performed a two-song acoustic set for BMG&#x27;s Pre-Grammy Party at the No Name bar in Los Angeles.

On December 6 and 7, 2019, Cantrell performed two sold-out solo concerts at the Pico Union Project in Los Angeles. His first solo concerts since 2004. Cantrell performed his solo material along with Alice in Chains&#x27; songs and covers of other artists such as Elton John and Creedence Clearwater Revival. He was joined by Greg Puciato and Terra Lopez on vocals, Tyler Bates on guitar, Johnny Scaglione on acoustic guitar, James Lomenzo on bass, Gil Sharone on drums, Jordan Lewis on keyboards and Michael Rozon on pedal steel guitar.

On January 24, 2020, Cantrell announced that he was working on a new solo album. He started recording at Dave&#x27;s Room Recording Studio in North Hollywood, California on March 10, 2020. On March 4, 2021, he announced via his Instagram page that he had completed the album, captioning the photo &quot;Finished my record tonight one year to the day from when we started recording it. What a crazy journey ... always is. Look forward to setting it free upon your ear holes sometime soon.&quot; On July 28, 2021, Cantrell posted a teaser trailer in his social media announcing that a new song and video titled &quot;Atone&quot; would be released on July 29. Cantrell&#x27;s third solo album is titled &quot;Brighten&quot; and was released on October 29, 2021.
Cantrell announced a new song, &quot;Vilified&quot;, to be released on July 25, 2024. Cantrell released his fourth solo album titled &quot;I Want Blood&quot; on October 18, 2024

==Style==
Cantrell&#x27;s early influences made Alice in Chains&#x27; heavy metal tones stand out among their fellow grunge/alternative rock-oriented bands of the Seattle music scene. However, his musical range also extends into elements of blues and country as heard on his solo debut album. Cantrell&#x27;s guitar playing is known for its unique use of wah pedal as well as odd time signatures. In a 1998 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, he was asked about the latter quality:

==Equipment==

Cantrell has been most famously seen playing a G&amp;L Guitars&#x27; Rampage model. The two models most closely identified with Cantrell are instruments manufactured in the 1980s. They feature a maple body, maple neck and ebony fingerboard. The bridge is a Kahler Tremolo as opposed to a Floyd Rose tremolo which was commonly seen on instruments made throughout the 1980s and 90s. The guitars feature a single-bridge humbucker wired to a volume control.

G&amp;L Guitars makes two Jerry Cantrell Signature guitars available to the general public for purchase. The first is a Rampage model which is very similar to the instrument most closely identified with Cantrell, known as the &quot;Blue Dress Rampage&quot; for having an image of a vintage pin-up girl wearing a blue dress, which Cantrell taped to the top of his first guitar. The second is a guitar called the &#x27;Superhawk&#x27;. This guitar features a fixed bridge and the addition of a neck pickup.

Cantrell used the original &quot;Blue Dress&quot; guitar on the music videos for &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, &quot;We Die Young&quot;, &quot;Sea of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Grind&quot;, and &quot;Again&quot;. The guitar can also be seen in the movie &quot;Singles&quot;. In 2011, Cantrell revealed that he had to retire the guitar due to a hairline crack from the neck all the way through the back of the body. Before that, he had never gone on tour without it.

Apart from his signature G&amp;L Guitars, Cantrell has also been seen playing a Telecaster, a Fender Standard Stratocaster Brown Sunburst, a Gibson Les Paul most notably an Ivory White Les Paul with torch burn marks that Cantrell made all over the guitar, which is the guitar that Cantrell has used on all of the Alice in Chains albums along with the original Blue Dress G&amp;L. Also a Gibson Custom Shop Jerry Cantrell SG, a 1952 Goldtop Les Paul, an Ernie Ball Music Man EVH that was a gift from Eddie Van Halen in the 1990s, but has been stolen from Cantrell, a dark blue Mosrite Ventures model, a Dean Michael Schenker USA V, and Dean Soltero guitars. The Ernie Ball Music Man EVH Guitar that was stolen in 2001 was returned to him and made an appearance at a gig in 2018.

Cantrell used a variety of amplifiers such as those made by Bogner, Mesa Boogie and Marshall throughout his career. He has most recently been using a signature amp called the, &#x27;JJ100&#x27; made for him by Friedman Amplification.

In 2010, Jim Dunlop introduced the &quot;JC95 Cantrell Signature Cry Baby&quot;, Cantrell&#x27;s signature Cry Baby wah pedal, based on the original Jimi Hendrix Wah pedal that Cantrell used since his early days. The lyrics to &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; are printed on the base plate of the pedal. In 2013, a limited edition of the pedal was released in black and red featuring the cover artwork for the album &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot;, and the lyrics to &quot;Stone&quot; on the bottom. In January 2019, Dunlop released a new version of the pedal, with a design based on Cantrell&#x27;s tribal orca tattoo created by Coast Salish artist Joe Wilson, and lyrics for the Alice in Chains song &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; on the bottom plate.

==Legacy==
Cantrell is widely considered to be one of the greatest rock guitarists of his generation. Pantera and Damageplan guitarist Dimebag Darrell expressed his admiration for Cantrell&#x27;s guitar work in an interview for &quot;Guitar International&quot; in 1995, saying that &quot;the layering and the honest feel that Jerry Cantrell gets on [Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Dirt&quot;] record is worth a lot more than someone who plays five million notes&quot;.

In July 2006, British hard rock/metal magazine &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; awarded Cantrell the title of &quot;Riff Lord&quot; at its annual Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards show, held at the London Astoria. He was apparently thrilled at winning the title over several famous artists such as Slash, James Hetfield, and Jimmy Page.

He was ranked 38th out of 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time by &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2004, and ranked at No. 37 out of &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; also by &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2012.

Elton John stated in a 2009 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he&#x27;s been an admirer of Cantrell for quite some time, and couldn&#x27;t resist the offer to play on Alice in Chains&#x27; song &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; at Cantrell&#x27;s request.

Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash stated in a 2010 interview with Epiphone.com that Cantrell is one of the most inspiring lead guitar players that have come out in the last 20 years.

In a 2015 interview with Loudwire discussing five of his essential guitar albums, Slayer guitarist Kerry King said about Cantrell:
In 2016, Blend Guitar ranked Cantrell at No. 7 on its list of &quot;Top 10 Underrated Guitarists&quot;, and Loudwire ranked him at No. 38 on its list of &quot;The 66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

In 2018, Cantrell was named &quot;Guitarist of the Year&quot; by Ultimate Guitar&#x27;s readers poll. Cantrell and William DuVall were also tied at No. 10 on Total Guitar/MusicRadar&#x27;s &quot;15 best rock guitarists in the world right now&quot; poll.

===Acting===
In his teens, Cantrell was acting in lead roles in high school plays. In a 1998 Q&amp;A, Cantrell revealed that acting has always been an interest to him.

Cantrell is featured in the 1992 movie &quot;Singles&quot;, along with the rest of Alice in Chains performing the songs &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Like That&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates Layne Staley and Mike Starr were featured on the music video &quot;Never a Know, But the No&quot;, from the Seattle thrash metal band Forced Entry.

In 1995, Cantrell played journalist Nona Weisbaum on the Alice in Chains mockumentary &quot;The Nona Tapes&quot;.

In 1996, he had a cameo in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; playing &quot;Jesus of CopyMat&quot;, the CopyMat worker who helped Tom Cruise&#x27;s character make copies of his manifesto. Cantrell said about the film; &quot;I get more people coming up to me telling me my line. It was such a big movie and it was really fun to do.&quot; Cantrell was also Crowe&#x27;s first choice for the role of Stillwater bass player Larry Fellows in &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000), but he was busy writing the songs for his solo album &quot;Degradation Trip&quot; and had to turn the role down. Mark Kozelek was cast instead.

He also had a cameo as himself in the 2009 film noir comedy &quot;Rock Slyde&quot;, appeared on the background of two scenes from the first episode of season three of the HBO TV series &quot;Deadwood&quot; in 2006, and made a cameo in &quot;&quot; in 2019.

==Personal life==
Cantrell was homeless in the early 1990s and lived for some time at the house of Pearl Jam&#x27;s manager Kelly Curtis. While living in the basement of Curtis&#x27; house, Cantrell was roommates with Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder. At the start of 1991, Cantrell moved in with Soundgarden lead singer Chris Cornell and his then-wife Susan Silver at their house in Seattle. Silver was also Alice in Chains&#x27; manager. Cantrell wrote the song &quot;Rooster&quot; at the Cornells&#x27; house and stayed there for a few weeks. Cantrell would later pay tribute to Cornell during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony on April 14, 2018, joining singer Ann Wilson for a rendition of Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;. Alice in Chains also paid tribute to Cornell on the one year anniversary of his death on May 18, 2018. The band covered two Soundgarden songs, &quot;Hunted Down&quot; and &quot;Boot Camp&quot;, closing their headlining set at the Rock on the Range festival in Columbus, Ohio. Towards the end of &quot;Boot Camp&quot;, the lights on stage spelled out &quot;CC&quot; for Chris Cornell and &quot;SG&quot; for Soundgarden as feedback rang out.

Cantrell lived in Monroe, Washington, from the mid-1990s until the early 2000s. He has lived in Studio City, California, since 2003, and he has maintained a residence in Burien, Washington since 2012.

=== Friendship with Layne Staley ===
Cantrell was a close friend of late Alice in Chains&#x27; lead singer Layne Staley, who was described by Cantrell as his best friend. Staley died on April 5, 2002, at the same time of Cantrell&#x27;s &quot;Degradation Trip&quot; tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to do interviews - it&#x27;s hard to talk about it [Staley&#x27;s death]. I&#x27;m just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.&quot; &quot;The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne&#x27;s funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It&#x27;s one of those things where if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again.&quot; Cantrell&#x27;s manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said that Jerry really loved Layne and they had a bond he hadn&#x27;t seen before. Asked about Staley&#x27;s death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: &quot;It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m still dealing with, and I still think like he&#x27;s here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I&#x27;ll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say about it.&quot; William DuVall, who performed Staley&#x27;s vocals during Cantrell&#x27;s solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: &quot;I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I&#x27;m holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can&#x27;t quantify it really in words.&quot;

Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at 98 Rock&#x27;s Livestock Festival in Zephyrhills on April 28 in order to attend Staley&#x27;s funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, &quot;Degradation Trip&quot;, released two months after Staley&#x27;s death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley&#x27;s cat, a female Siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell&#x27;s episode of &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains&#x27; concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.

=== Religious views ===
Cantrell is critical of religion and Young Earth creationism, satirizing them both in Alice in Chains&#x27; 2013 album, &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot;. Cantrell stated, &quot;There are two things you never want to get into a conversation or argument about: politics and religion. But fuck, I guess we&#x27;re going to be talking about this for awhile.&quot; &quot;No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in.&quot; Cantrell also stated that he&#x27;s sick of the hypocrisy that&#x27;s taken over many facets of organized religion. &quot;I think there&#x27;s overwhelming evidence that things aren&#x27;t working right now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you&#x27;re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there&#x27;s a huge problem.&quot;

===Surgeries===
During his independent tour for &quot;Degradation Trip&quot; before the album was released, Cantrell broke his left hand while playing football after a concert at the Kentucky Derby on May 3, 2001. While Cantrell was running full speed, his guitar player at the time, Bryan Kehoe, was also running full speed towards him and Cantrell got his pinky finger caught in Kehoe&#x27;s T-shirt sleeve. Cantrell went to the emergency room but they could not do anything for him there, since the bone had slipped back in his hand and he would need a reconstructive surgery, but he had to wait for a couple of weeks for that to happen. Cantrell wanted to continue the tour, and although he was in a lot of pain, he played his first concert as a frontman without a guitar opening for Cheap Trick in Atlanta. Cantrell needed a titanium plate and four screws to put the bones back together. Cantrell reported that breaking his hand was the worst physical pain he ever had. The injury caused the remainder of Cantrell&#x27;s solo tour to be postponed. His first concert after the surgery was at the Key Club in West Hollywood on July 1, 2001.

Cantrell underwent shoulder surgery twice. In December 2005, a surgery in his left shoulder removed bone fragments and repaired cartilage. During a chat at ESPN.com on November 29, 2011, Cantrell revealed that he had gone through another surgery earlier that year, this time in his right shoulder and that he was in the tail end of the rehabilitation process. The surgery postponed the recording sessions of &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot; as Cantrell could not play guitar for eight months while he was recovering. Cantrell explained the surgery saying, &quot;The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [and] cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I&#x27;ve had them both done now. It&#x27;s a repetitive motion injury from playing.&quot; While recuperating at home in a sling, Cantrell heard a riff in his head and sang it into his phone. The riff later became the song &quot;Stone&quot;, the first single from &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot;.

===Substance abuse===
Cantrell is a recovering addict and alcoholic and has been sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, &quot;I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [Kinney] was at the door with my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some blackberry bushes. That&#x27;s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn&#x27;t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush at the bottom of a cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn&#x27;t intend to get here but I&#x27;m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It&#x27;s been an amazing day. It&#x27;s overwhelming. I&#x27;m as imperfect as they come. I just don&#x27;t get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don&#x27;t get that chance. My band&#x27;s been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don&#x27;t deal with it.&quot; Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, &quot;We really miss Layne [Staley] and Mike [Starr], and we carry them with us in our hearts&quot;.

On November 10, 2004, Cantrell was among the musicians who performed a short acoustic set to benefit &quot;Help The Homeless&quot; in Hollywood, California.

In 2007, Cantrell auctioned off some of his favorite clothes from key moments in his career to benefit MusiCares and the Layne Staley Fund, which provides support and treatment for heroin recovery in the Seattle music community.

Since 2009, Cantrell has hosted the &quot;Alice in Chains &amp; Friends Charity Fantasy Football League&quot;. Each participant puts up an item for an online auction and all of the proceeds goes to the charity chosen by the champion of the league. Cantrell founded the league to combine his love of fantasy football with the goal of helping a worthy cause. Cantrell won the league for the first time in 2016, and in 2017 he decided to donate the proceeds to MusiCares in Chris Cornell&#x27;s memory, and to Music for Relief in memory of Chester Bennington. Both musicians died in 2017. In 2018, Cantrell named the league&#x27;s trophy after his friend Vinnie Paul, who had died recently.

On May 15, 2015, Cantrell performed at the second annual Acoustic-4-A-Cure concert in benefit of the Pediatric Cancer Program at the University of California, San Francisco.

Cantrell is a supporter of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and has performed at benefit concerts and charity golf tournaments to raise funds for the hospital that treats children with cancer.

Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates offer special seating at their concerts for veterans from Operation Ward 57, a fund for wounded soldiers.

In 2015, Alice in Chains donated two dollars from every pre-sold ticket of their summer tour to help the family of a fan named Stefan Dayne-Ankle, who died after a battle with leukemia.

Cantrell also supports Music for Relief, Autism Speaks, Rock Against MS Foundation, and the Los Angeles Police Memorial Foundation.

<text>Marcus Aurelius Marius was emperor of the Gallic Empire in 269 following the assassination of Postumus.

== Reign ==
According to later tradition, he was a blacksmith by trade, which earned him the nickname &quot;Mamurius Veturius&quot;, a legendary metalworker in the time of Numa. He rose through the ranks of the Roman army to become an officer. He was part of the army that revolted at Moguntiacum (Mainz) after the Emperor Postumus refused to allow them to sack the city. They murdered the emperor and in the confusion that followed, the army elected Marius as Postumus&#x27; successor.

His first decision was to allow his troops to sack the city of Moguntiacum. He then moved to Augusta Treverorum (Trier) to consolidate his power base. His reign lasted no more than two or three months before Postumus&#x27; praetorian prefect Victorinus had Marius killed in mid-269, most likely at Augusta Treverorum.

According to ancient written sources, Marius&#x27; reign lasted only two or three days before he was killed by a sword of his own manufacture. This tradition is probably partly or wholly inaccurate. Based on the number of coins he issued, a more accurate length for his reign would be at least two or three months.

Marius is listed as one of the Thirty Tyrants in the Historia Augusta. It is said that he was chosen because his name was reminiscent of two great Romans of the past, Marcus Aurelius and Gaius Marius.

<doc id="262553" wikidata="Q2034862" url="?curid=262553" title="Factor of safety">
<text>In engineering, a factor of safety (FoS) or safety factor (SF) expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load. Safety factors are often calculated using detailed analysis because comprehensive testing is impractical on many projects, such as bridges and buildings, but the structure&#x27;s ability to carry a load must be determined to a reasonable accuracy.
Many systems are intentionally built much stronger than needed for normal usage to allow for emergency situations, unexpected loads, misuse, or degradation (reliability).
Margin of safety (MoS or MS) is a related measure, expressed as a relative change.

== Definition ==
There are two definitions for the factor of safety (FoS):
* The ratio of a structure&#x27;s absolute strength (structural capability) to actual applied load; this is a measure of the reliability of a particular design. This is a calculated value, and is sometimes referred to, for the sake of clarity, as a &quot;realized factor of safety&quot;.
* A constant required value, imposed by law, standard, specification, contract or custom, to which a structure must conform or exceed. This can be referred to as a &quot;design factor&quot;, &quot;design factor of safety&quot; or &quot;required factor of safety&quot;.

The realized factor of safety must be greater than the required design factor of safety. However, between various industries and engineering groups usage is inconsistent and confusing; there are several definitions used. The cause of much confusion is that various reference books and standards agencies use the factor of safety definitions and terms differently. Building codes, structural and mechanical engineering textbooks often refer to the &quot;factor of safety&quot; as the fraction of total structural capability over what is needed. Those are realized factors of safety (first use). Many undergraduate strength of materials books use &quot;Factor of Safety&quot; as a constant value intended as a minimum target for design (second use).

== Calculation ==
There are several ways to compare the factor of safety for structures. All the different calculations fundamentally measure the same thing: how much extra load beyond what is intended a structure will actually take (or be required to withstand). The difference between the methods is the way in which the values are calculated and compared. Safety factor values can be thought of as a standardized way for comparing strength and reliability between systems.

The use of a factor of safety does not imply that an item, structure, or design is &quot;safe&quot;. Many quality assurance, engineering design, manufacturing, installation, and end-use factors may influence whether or not something is safe in any particular situation.

=== Design factor and safety factor ===
The difference between the safety factor and design factor (design safety factor) is as follows: The safety factor, or yield stress, is how much the designed part actually will be able to withstand (first usage from above). The design factor, or working stress, is what the item is required to be able to withstand (second usage). The design factor is defined for an application (generally provided in advance and often set by regulatory building codes or policy) and is not an actual calculation, the safety factor is a ratio of maximum strength to intended load for the actual item that was designed.
:formula_1
* The &quot;design load&quot; is the maximum load the part should ever see in service.
By this definition, a structure with an FoS of exactly 1 will support only the design load and no more. Any additional load will cause the structure to fail. A structure with an FoS of 2 will fail at twice the design load.

=== Margin of safety ===
Many government agencies and industries (such as aerospace) require the use of a &quot;margin of safety&quot; (&quot;MoS&quot; or &quot;MS&quot;) to describe the ratio of the strength of the structure to the requirements. There are two separate definitions for the margin of safety so care is needed to determine which is being used for a given application. One usage of MS is as a measure of capability like FoS. The other usage of MS is as a measure of satisfying design requirements (requirement verification). Margin of safety can be conceptualized (along with the reserve factor explained below) to represent how much of the structure&#x27;s total capability is held &quot;in reserve&quot; during loading.

MS as a measure of structural capability: This definition of margin of safety commonly seen in textbooks describes what additional load beyond the design load a part can withstand before failing. In effect, this is a measure of excess capability. If the margin is 0, the part will not take any additional load before it fails, if it is negative the part will fail before reaching its design load in service. If the margin is 1, it can withstand one additional load of equal force to the maximum load it was designed to support (i.e. twice the design load).
:formula_2
:formula_3
MS as a measure of requirement verification: Many agencies and organizations such as NASA and AIAA define the margin of safety including the design factor, in other words, the margin of safety is calculated after applying the design factor. In the case of a margin of 0, the part is at exactly the &quot;required&quot; strength (the safety factor would equal the design factor). If there is a part with a required design factor of 3 and a margin of 1, the part would have a safety factor of 6 (capable of supporting two loads equal to its design factor of 3, supporting six times the design load before failure). A margin of 0 would mean the part would pass with a safety factor of 3. If the margin is less than 0 in this definition, although the part will not necessarily fail, the design requirement has not been met. A convenience of this usage is that for all applications, a margin of 0 or higher is passing, one does not need to know application details or compare against requirements, just glancing at the margin calculation tells whether the design passes or not. This is helpful for oversight and reviewing on projects with various integrated components, as different components may have various design factors involved and the margin calculation helps prevent confusion.
* The &quot;design safety factor&quot; is provided as a requirement.
:formula_4
:formula_5
For a successful design, the realized safety factor must always equal or exceed the design safety factor so that the margin of safety is greater than or equal to zero. The margin of safety is sometimes, but infrequently, used as a percentage, i.e., a 0.50 MS is equivalent to a 50% MS. When a design satisfies this test it is said to have a &quot;positive margin&quot;, and, conversely, a &quot;negative margin&quot; when it does not.

In the field of nuclear safety (as implemented at US government-owned facilities) the margin of safety has been defined as a quantity that may not be reduced without review by the controlling government office. The US Department of Energy publishes DOE G 424.1-1, &quot;Implementation Guide for Use in Addressing Unreviewed Safety Question Requirements&quot; as a guide for determining how to identify and determine whether a margin of safety will be reduced by a proposed change. The guide develops and applies the concept of a qualitative margin of safety that may not be explicit or quantifiable, yet can be evaluated conceptually to determine whether an increase or decrease will occur with a proposed change. This approach becomes important when examining designs with large or undefined (historical) margins and those that depend on &quot;soft&quot; controls such as programmatic limits or requirements. The commercial US nuclear industry utilized a similar concept in evaluating planned changes until 2001, when 10 CFR 50.59 was revised to capture and apply the information available in facility-specific risk analyses and other quantitative risk management tools.

=== Reserve factor ===
A measure of strength frequently used in Europe is the &quot;reserve factor&quot; (RF). With the strength and applied loads expressed in the same units, the reserve factor is defined in one of two ways, depending on the industry:
:formula_6
:formula_7
The applied loads have many factors, including factors of safety applied.

== Yield and ultimate calculations ==
For ductile materials (e.g. most metals), it is often required that the factor of safety be checked against both yield and ultimate strengths. The yield calculation will determine the safety factor until the part starts to deform plastically. The ultimate calculation will determine the safety factor until failure. In brittle materials the yield and ultimate strengths are often so close as to be indistinguishable, so it is usually acceptable to only calculate the ultimate safety factor.

== Choosing design factors ==
Appropriate design factors are based on several considerations, such as the accuracy of predictions on the imposed loads, strength, wear estimates, and the environmental effects to which the product will be exposed in service; the consequences of engineering failure; and the cost of over-engineering the component to achieve that factor of safety . For example, components whose failure could result in substantial financial loss, serious injury, or death may use a safety factor of four or higher (often ten). Non-critical components generally might have a design factor of two. Risk analysis, failure mode and effects analysis, and other tools are commonly used. Design factors for specific applications are often mandated by law, policy, or industry standards.

Buildings commonly use a factor of safety of 2.0 for each structural member. The value for buildings is relatively low because the loads are well understood and most structures are redundant. Pressure vessels use 3.5 to 4.0, automobiles use 3.0, and aircraft and spacecraft use 1.2 to 4.0 depending on the application and materials. Ductile, metallic materials tend to use the lower value while brittle materials use the higher values. The field of aerospace engineering uses generally lower design factors because the costs associated with structural weight are high (i.e. an aircraft with an overall safety factor of 5 would probably be too heavy to get off the ground). This low design factor is why aerospace parts and materials are subject to very stringent quality control and strict preventative maintenance schedules to help ensure reliability. A usually applied Safety Factor is 1.5, but for pressurized fuselage it is 2.0, and for main landing gear structures it is often 1.25.

In some cases it is impractical or impossible for a part to meet the &quot;standard&quot; design factor. The penalties (mass or otherwise) for meeting the requirement would prevent the system from being viable (such as in the case of aircraft or spacecraft). In these cases, it is sometimes determined to allow a component to meet a lower than normal safety factor, often referred to as &quot;waiving&quot; the requirement. Doing this often brings with it extra detailed analysis or quality control verifications to assure the part will perform as desired, as it will be loaded closer to its limits.

For loading that is cyclical, repetitive, or fluctuating, it is important to consider the possibility of metal fatigue when choosing factor of safety. A cyclic load well below a material&#x27;s yield strength can cause failure if it is repeated through enough cycles.

== History ==
According to Elishakoff the notion of factor of safety in engineering context was apparently first introduced in 1729 by Bernard Forest de Bélidor (1698-1761) who was a French engineer working in hydraulics, mathematics, civil, and military engineering. The philosophical aspects of factors of safety were pursued by Doorn and Hansson.

<doc id="262555" wikidata="Q265962" url="?curid=262555" title="Krahn people">
<text>The Krahn are an ethnic group of Liberia and Ivory Coast. This group belongs to the Kru language family and its people are sometimes referred to as the Wee, Guéré, Sapo, or Wobe. It is likely that Western contact with the Kru language is the primary reason for the development of these different names.

== History ==
The Krahn arrived in an area of Liberia previously known as the &quot;Grain Coast&quot; as part of early 16th-century migrations from the northeast and what is now Ivory Coast. This migration occurred due to pressure on local populations resulting from the emigration of ethnic groups from western Sudan after the decline of medieval empires, as well as an increase in regional wars.

At the time, the African slave trade was becoming more prominent within Liberia. Some Kru subgroups were sold into slavery by their neighbours, but it was more common for the Krahn and other coastal peoples in Liberia to serve as local traders, brokering deals within the Western slave market. Many Kru committed suicide rather than face enslavement.

=== Liberian Civil Wars ===
During the late 1970s, Liberia faced heated civil unrest in which opposition to the Americo-Liberian and Tolbert government led to a military coup, organized in part by indigenous tribal members. The tension culminated in coup on April 12, 1980, in which Master Sergeant Samuel Kanyon Doe, a member of the Krahn ethnic group and leader of the group involved in the coup, seized power, becoming Liberia&#x27;s first native leader and head of state. With a Krahn leader serving as a key political figure, the once disparaged Krahn were now more prominently included in Liberia&#x27;s governing body.

This rise in status led many Krahn speakers to move to the capital, Monrovia. Doe began showing favoritism to the Krahn, particularly to those from his own tribal group. These measures included appointing members of the Krahn&#x27;s ethnic kin from Ivory Coast, known more commonly as the Wee, to the Executive Mansion Guard, as well as taking steps to prevent people of other ethnicities from reaching key government positions.

By 1985, Doe&#x27;s response to his opposition created a large &quot;anti-Doe&quot; contingent. In December 1989, exiles and local recruits began organizing military groups, resulting in another civil war against Doe and his Krahn supporters. As this war progressed, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) began attacking Krahn civilians in Nimba and Grand Gedeh counties, destroying entire communities as they moved through the country.

By mid-1990 the war had escalated, prompting foreign intervention. Doe was kidnapped and executed by opposition forces. Following the removal of the Doe regime and the continuation of the civil war, Krahn refugees began fleeing from Liberia to Ivory Coast, some taking the Krahn language with them.

Although Doe was removed from power in 1990, the civil war did not officially end until 1996, at which time Charles Taylor ran for the presidency, winning the 1997 general election amid much controversy. Because of their opposition to Taylor and their affiliation with the previous regime and with rebel groups like ULIMO, Taylor initiated a crackdown against the Krahn. In 1998, Taylor attempted to murder one of his political opponents, the former warlord Roosevelt Johnson, causing clashes in Monrovia, during and after which hundreds of Krahn were massacred and hundreds more fled Liberia. This event was one of the factors that led to the outbreak of the Second Liberian Civil War.

In 2003, members of the Krahn tribe founded a rebel group, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), opposing Taylor. The group disbanded as part of the peace agreement at the end of the second civil war.

=== Recent history ===
The stability that followed the civil war has allowed the Krahn to resettle throughout the country. As of 2022, Krahn are typically found in Nimba, Grand Gedeh, and Sinoe counties, as well as Ivory Coast.

== Culture ==
Liberia&#x27;s Krahn were originally hunters, fishermen and farmers, traditionally focusing on rice and cassava production. Slow or failing development of regions with many Krahn settlers led many of the younger Krahn generations to migrate to areas such as Monrovia. The Wee in Ivory Coast were hunters, fishermen and farmers as well, though they tended to focus more heavily on crops such as &quot;rice, yams, taro, manioc, maize, and bananas.&quot; Like the Krahn in Liberia, the Wee traditions of hunting and farming have become unsustainable, and in more recent years many have taken work in diamond camps and on rubber plantations.

=== Early political structures ===

Early Krahn political organizations were traditionally decentralized in both Liberia and Ivory Coast. Often, tribes did not have a central governing power, instead turning to a village &quot;headman&quot; who rose to a position of social esteem through skill, hard work, and luck in hunting and farming. These individuals often formed councils consisting of young warriors for protection and village elders to serve as consultants in village affairs. This governing group would broker trades with neighboring tribes, as well as make important decisions for the tribe members. 

Within these tribal groups, it was not uncommon for ceremonial face masks to serve dual roles in rituals and politics. These masks were often modeled after animals and were utilized in community mediations. They may also have been a means of implementing social control in the years prior to adoption of Western laws during the colonial period.

=== Religion ===
Many Krahn people believe that objects have spirits or souls (animism). The Wee of Ivory Coast also believe that the natural world is made up of &quot;bush spirits.&quot; These spirits are part of the world untouched by man, and the Wee believe that keeping these spirits appeased is vital to the health of the tribe. Whenever new land requires cultivating for fields or expansion, or when tribesmen needed to venture outside the village, it becomes necessary to make offerings to the spirits. It is further believed that the bush spirits take corporeal form in order to interact with the villagers and participate in ceremonies.
The Wee believe that the bush spirits can communicate with humans through dreams, often demanding ceremonial masks be created in their honor in either male or female form. These masks then serve a variety of functions, ranging from ritual ceremonies, entertainment, and focal points in moral stories to judicial and political controls. Typically, female masks are viewed as less imposing and more beautiful than male masks and are in turn used more for ritual and entertainment purposes, while the male masks are often more ferocious-looking and used in sociopolitical contexts. All Wee masks are believed to deflect sorcery, and many undergo shifts in their primary function during their lifetime.

==Language==
The Krahn language is one of the Kru languages in the Niger–Congo language family. Although many Kru-speaking tribes have adopted English as their second language, recent studies have shown that Kru is still spoken by many Liberians. Within the Kru languages there are several subcategories, with Eastern and Western Kru offering the first significant division of tribal language breakdowns. Krahn falls under the Western Kru, Wee subgroup.

Some scholars further denote a difference between Eastern and Western Krahn, with Eastern variations typically spoken in northeast Liberia and Western Krahn spoken throughout Grand Gedeh County and Ivory Coast. As of 2020, there were approximately Eastern Krahn speakers within Liberia, with an additional Western Krahn speakers in Liberia and, according to a 1993 estimate, in Ivory Coast.

<text>Philadelphia International Airport is the primary international airport serving Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It served 12.4 million passengers annually in 2022, making it the busiest airport in Pennsylvania and the 21st-busiest airport in the United States. The airport is located from the city&#x27;s downtown area and has 22 airlines that offer nearly 500 daily departures to more than 130 destinations worldwide.

The airport is the fifth-largest hub for American Airlines and serves as American Airlines&#x27; primary hub in the Northeastern United States and its primary European and transatlantic gateway. The airport is a regional cargo hub for UPS Airlines and a focus city for Frontier Airlines. The airport has service to cities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Middle East. As of 2019, the airport offers flights to 140 destinations, 102 of which are domestic and 38 of which international.

Much of the airport property is in the city of Philadelphia. Terminal A, the international terminal, and the western and southern ends of the airfield are in Tinicum Township, Delaware County. PHL covers and has four runways.

Philadelphia International Airport is an important component of the economies of Philadelphia, the Delaware Valley metropolitan region to which it belongs, and Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth&#x27;s Aviation Bureau reported in its Pennsylvania Air Service Monitor that the total economic impact made by the state&#x27;s airports in 2004 was $22 billion. In 2017, the airport commissioned a new economic impact report, which found that it accounted for $15.4 billion in economic activity, $5.4 billion in total earnings, and over 96,000 direct and indirect jobs. In October 2022, the airport gained a direct connection to a Colonial Pipeline fuel supply.

==History==
Starting in 1925, the Pennsylvania National Guard used the present airport site (known as Hog Island) as a training airfield. The site was dedicated as the &quot;Philadelphia Municipal Airport&quot; by Charles Lindbergh in 1927, but it had no proper terminal building until 1940; airlines used Camden Central Airport in nearby Pennsauken Township, New Jersey. Once Philadelphia&#x27;s terminal was completed (on the east side of the field) American, Eastern, TWA, and United moved their operations here.

In 1947 and 1950, the airport had runways 4, 9, 12 and 17, all or less. In 1956 runway 9 was ; in 1959 it was and runway 12 was closed. Not much changed until the early 1970s, when runway 4 was closed and 9R opened with .

On June 20, 1940, the airport&#x27;s weather station became the official point for Philadelphia weather observations and records by the National Weather Service.

During World War II the United States Army Air Forces used the airport as a First Air Force training airfield.

Beginning in 1940, Rising Sun School of Aeronautics of Coatesville performed primary flight training at the airport under contract to the Air Corps. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the I Fighter Command Philadelphia Fighter Wing provided air defense of the Delaware Valley area from the airport. Throughout the war, various fighter and bomber groups were organized and trained at Philadelphia airport and assigned to the Philadelphia Fighter Wing before being sent to advanced training airfields or being deployed overseas. Known units assigned were the 33d, 58th, 355th and 358th Fighter Groups.

In June 1943, I Fighter Command transferred jurisdiction of the airport to the Air Technical Service Command (ATSC). ATSC established a sub-depot of the Middletown Air Depot at the airport. The 855th Army Air Forces Specialized Depot unit repaired and overhauled aircraft and returned them to active service, and the Army Air Forces Training Command established the Philco Training School on January 1, 1943, which trained personnel in radio repair and operations.

In 1945, the Air Force reduced its use of the airport and it was returned to civil control that September.

Philadelphia Municipal became Philadelphia International Airport in 1945, when American Overseas Airlines began direct flights to Europe. A new terminal opened in December 1953; the oldest parts of the present terminal complex (B and C) were built in the late 1950s.

As of April 1957, the airport was providing 30 weekday departures on Eastern, 24 on TWA, 24 on United, 18 on American, 16 on National, 14 on Capital, six on Allegheny, and three on Delta. To Europe, five Pan Am DC-6Bs a week via Idlewild and Boston and two TWA 749As a week via Idlewild; one TWA flight continued to Ceylon. Eastern and National had nonstops to Miami, but the TWA 1049G to LAX that started in 1956 was the only nonstop beyond Chicago. The first scheduled jets were TWA 707s in the summer of 1959.

Terminal B/C modernization was completed in 1970, Terminal D opened in 1973 and Terminal E in 1977; the $300 million expansion was designed by Arnold Thompson Associates, Inc. and Vincent G. Kling &amp; Associates.

In the 1980s, the airport hosted several hubs. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 allowed regional carrier Altair Airlines to create a small hub at PHL using Fokker F-28s. Altair began in 1967 with flights to cities such as Rochester, New York, Hartford, Connecticut and to Florida until it ceased operations in November 1982. In the mid-1980s Eastern Air Lines opened a hub in Concourse C. The airline declined in the late 1980s and sold aircraft and gate leases to Chicago-based Midway Airlines. Midway operated its Philadelphia hub until it ceased operation in 1991. During the 1980s US Airways (then called USAir) built a hub at PHL.

US Airways became the dominant carrier at the airport in the 1980s and 1990s and shifted most of its hub operations from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia in 2003. As of 2013, the airport was US Airways&#x27; largest international hub and its second-largest hub overall behind Charlotte. PHL became an American Airlines hub after it completed its merger with US Airways in 2015 and remains one of the airline&#x27;s biggest hubs, offering an average of 420 departing flights per day to over 100 destinations. In recent years, American has opted to continue expanding at PHL while downsizing its hub at JFK in New York due to greater slot availability, lower operation costs in Philadelphia, and its greater network of connecting flights.

In July 1999 the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and several U.S. federal government agencies selected a route for the connecting ramps from Interstate 95 to the Terminal A-West complex, then under development; the agency tried to avoid the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum. K/B Fund II, the owner of the International Plaza complex, formerly the Scott Paper headquarters Scott Plaza, objected to the proposed routing, saying it would interfere with International Plaza development. It entered a filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to challenge the proposed routing. In 2000, the airport attempted to acquire the complex for $90 million but Tinicum Township commissioners stopped the deal from going forward, citing concerns of a loss of tax revenue for the township and the Interboro School District, which serves Tinicum, as well as noise pollution concerns.

In 2002 construction on the controversial new entrance ramps went forward. The new ramps eliminated the traffic signal and stop intersections previously encountered by northbound I-95 motorists who had to use Route 291 to the airport. The project consisted of six new bridges, more than 4,300 linear feet of retaining walls, and 7.7 lane miles of new pavement. The project also included new highway lighting, overhead sign structures, landscaping and the paving of Bartram Avenue. Also under the project, PennDOT resurfaced I-95 between Route 420 and Island Avenue and built a truck enforcement and park-and-ride facility. In 2003 Terminal A-West opened, with a 1,500-space parking garage. Construction of the terminal was funded by airport revenue bonds sold by the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development.

By 2005 two studies dealt with expanding runway capacity at PHL: the Runway 17–35 Extension Project EIS and the PHL Capacity Enhancement Program EIS. Completed in May 2009, the Runway 17-35 Extension Project extended runway 17–35 to a length of , extending it at both ends and incorporating the proper runway safety areas. Other changes made with the Runway 17–35 Extension Project included additional taxiways and aprons, relocation of perimeter service roads, and modifications to nearby public roads.

The status of Philadelphia as an international gateway and major hub for American Airlines and the growth of Southwest Airlines and other low-cost carriers have increased passenger traffic to record levels in the mid-2000s; in 2004 28,507,420 passengers flew through Philadelphia, up 15.5% over 2003. In 2005, 31,502,855 passengers flew through PHL, marking a 10% increase since 2004. In 2006, 31,768,272 passengers travelled through PHL, a 0.9% increase. US Airways commenced a nonstop flight to Tel Aviv in July 2009. It operated an Airbus A330 on the route.

In 2011, a nearly 85,000-square-foot mural was completed along the sides of the airport parking garages that face I-95. The design includes images taken from photographs of Philadelphians dancing by local photographer JJ Tiziou. More than 800 people painted the mural over four months.

On November 14, 2019, after a five-year project, extended Runway 27L was dedicated and opened for operations. The runway was extended 1,500 feet to 12,000 feet with several new taxiways to accommodate the newest fleet of large aircraft that are popular on many long-haul flights. Runway 9R/27L, at 12,000 feet is the longest civil runway in all of Pennsylvania.

In 2023, the airport began a $15 million multi-year project to renovate and expand the airport&#x27;s restroom facilities, funded by a FAA Airport Terminal Program grant included in the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that was signed into law by President Joe Biden. The project will construct two new restrooms, five lactation suites, four service animal relief areas, 49 gender neutral restrooms, three adult assisted care restrooms, and upgrade 30 existing restrooms to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 2024, the airport received $20.4 million in federal funds allocated from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to perform HVAC and electrical system repairs at several terminals, baggage claims and ticket areas, and pedestrian bridges.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===

Philadelphia International Airport has six terminals with a total of 126 gates. Non pre-cleared international arrivals are processed in Terminal A. American operates Admirals Clubs in Terminal A, the B/C connector and Terminal F. Terminal A also contains a British Airways Galleries Lounge as well as a American Express Centurion Lounge. Terminal D contains a United Club as well as a Delta Sky Club. A USO lounge is located in Terminal E.

===Terminal A===
Terminal A is divided into two sections, east and west. Terminal A West has 13 gates, while Terminal A East has 11 gates. The 800,000 sqft Terminal A West has a modern and innovative design, made by Kohn Pedersen Fox, Pierce Goodwin Alexander &amp; Linville and Kelly/Maiello. Opened in 2003 as the new international terminal, it is now home to American (domestic and international), British Airways, and Discover Airlines. The Terminal A-West&#x27;s check-in lobby locates on the first floor, it has over 60 counters. The ceiling of the check-in lobby extends to the second floor. The Terminal A-West offers a variety of international dining options. 

Terminal A East, originally the airport&#x27;s international terminal, is now used by Aer Lingus and American domestic and international flights as well as international arrivals for Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. A-East is well maintained and received an upgrade to its baggage claim facilities. Most of the gates in this terminal are equipped to handle international arrivals and the passengers are led to the customs facility in Terminal A West. It opened in 1990. The security entrance was significantly enlarged in 2012.

There are three lounges along the corridor between Terminal A East and A West; an American Airlines Admirals Club, British Airways Galleries Lounge and American Express Centurion Lounge. The east terminal also contains an Admirals Club. There is also a children&#x27;s play area located in the east terminal.

International Arrivals (except from locations with Customs preclearance) arrive at gates in both Terminal A east and west and are processed at the Federal Inspection Facility at the Terminal A West 190 ft over the drop-off ramps and SEPTA tracks. The FIS features 56 Customs and Border Protection inspection booths and 8 baggage carousels. After clearing the customs, there is the Arrivals Hall dominated by an atrium, and 250-ft. long display of the &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;, conveying Philadelphia&#x27;s identity as America&#x27;s birthplace. In 2022, the International Arrivals Hall was renamed &quot;Reverend Dr. Leon H. Sullivan International Arrivals Hall&quot; in memory of Leon Sullivan.
===Terminals B and C===
Terminals B and C have 15 and 14 gates respectively. They are the two main terminals used by American. They were renovated at a cost of $135 million in 1998, which was designed by DPK&amp;A Architects, LLP. They are connected by a shopping mall and food court named the Philadelphia Marketplace. Remodeling was done in the gate areas, although these cosmetic changes will not solve the space problems at many of the gates. Overall, the facilities are fairly modern and dining options on the concourses are also available. They are the oldest terminals and opened in 1953. There is an American Airlines Admirals Club located in the B/C connector.

===Terminals D and E===

Terminal D has 16 gates; it opened in 1973. Terminal D is home to Air Canada, Delta, Spirit (check-in only with gates in Terminal E) and United. This terminal is connected to the shopping area of Terminals B/C through a post-security walkway. The terminal contains a United Club and a Delta Sky Club (recently announced to soon be remodeled and expanded).

Terminal E has 17 gates. It is home to Alaska Airlines (check-in only, departures from D6), Frontier, JetBlue (check-in only as of 2022), Southwest, and Sun Country Airlines (check-in only, departures from Terminal D). It opened in 1977, a fan-shaped extension at the end of the concourse was constructed along with the Connector Project in 2008. Terminal E houses a USO lounge available for all members of the military and their families.

The two terminals were connected in late 2008 with a new concourse while providing joint security, a variety of shops and restaurants and a link to Baggage Claims D and E. This is the inverse of the connector between Terminals B and C, which comprises a combined ticket hall but separate security facilities.

A new Chase Sapphire Lounge by The Club opened in the Terminal D/E connector concourse with a 20,000-square foot facility, one of the largest in its collection. 

===Terminal F===

Terminal F has 38 gates. The terminal is a regional terminal used by American Eagle and Contour Airlines flights. It includes special jet bridges that allow passengers to board regional jets without walking on the apron. Opened in 2001, Terminal F is the second newest terminal building at PHL. It was designed by Odell Associates, Inc. and The Sheward Partnership. An American Airlines Admirals Club is located above the central food court area of Terminal F.

When Terminal F opened in 2001, it had of space for concessions.

=== Overseas Terminal (old international terminal) ===
The Overseas Terminal housed all the international airlines at Philadelphia. It was opened in 1973 and the building was a converted hangar. It was replaced by Terminal A in 1991.

==Ground transportation==

SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s Airport Line serves stations at Terminals A, B, C, D, and E. The four stations are Airport Terminal A East/West, Airport Terminal B, Airport Terminals C &amp; D, and Airport Terminals E &amp; F. The stations are next to the baggage claim at each terminal with escalator and elevator access from each terminal&#x27;s skywalk. The Airport Line connects to Center City Philadelphia, other SEPTA trains, Amtrak trains, and NJ Transit trains at 30th Street Station. The Airport Line runs through Center City Philadelphia to Glenside, Pennsylvania; half of the trains continue to Warminster, Pennsylvania, on the Warminster Line while the other half of weekday trains diverge past Wayne Junction to continue to Fox Chase, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the Fox Chase Line and the other half of weekend/holiday trains terminate at Glenside. The Airport Line runs 5:00 a.m. to midnight daily, with trains every 30 minutes on weekdays and every hour on weekends and holidays. The ride from the airport to Center City Philadelphia takes 25 minutes.

Philadelphia International Airport has road access from an interchange with I-95 (exit 12 northbound and exit 12A southbound), which heads north toward Center City Philadelphia and south into Delaware County. PA 291 heads northeast from the airport area and provides access to and from I-76. Rental cars are available through a number of companies; each operates a shuttle bus between its facility and the terminals. As part of the airport&#x27;s expansion plan, the airport plans to construct a consolidated rental car facility. Taxis and ride-sharing services both serve the airport.

SEPTA has various bus routes to the airport: Route 37 (serving South Philadelphia and Chester Transportation Center), Route 108 (serving 69th Street Transportation Center and the UPS air hub), and Route 115 (serving Delaware County Community College and Darby Transportation Center). Local colleges and universities including The University of Pennsylvania, Villanova University, Swarthmore College, Haverford College and Saint Joseph&#x27;s University traditionally operate transportation shuttles to the airport for students during heavy travel periods such as spring and Thanksgiving breaks.

===Airline shuttle buses===

American Airlines offers &quot;tarmac-to-tarmac&quot; bus service between PHL and several airports within close proximity, which are considered too close for flights to be economically feasible. This is designed to facilitate connections through PHL, a major international hub for American Airlines. Passengers check their bags and clear security at their respective airport, and board a motorcoach which takes them directly to a gate past security at PHL. The service is operated by the Landline Company, and is booked through the regular American Airlines reservation system.

==Airlines and destinations==
Philadelphia International Airport is a major hub for American Airlines which utilizes the airport as a transatlantic connecting point between Europe and the United States. Over 100 daily or weekly destinations are served by the following airlines to the following destinations:

==Accidents and incidents==
* On January 14, 1951, National Airlines Flight 83 crashed upon landing at Philadelphia from Newark International Airport. The aircraft skidded off the runway, crashed through a fence and came to rest in a ditch. During the incident, the left wing broke off, rupturing the gas tanks and setting the plane on fire. There were seven fatalities in all. Frankie Housley, the lone flight attendant on Flight 83, led ten passengers to safety but died trying to save an infant.
* On July 19, 1970, United Airlines Flight 611, a Boeing 737-222 on a domestic flight to Rochester, New York, experienced an engine failure in the #1 engine right after rotation. The captain decided to reject the takeoff and set the plane back on the runway. The plane touched down 1075 feet short of the runway end, continued across a blast pad, crossing a field, then passing through a 6-foot aluminum chain link fence into a field full of grass, brush and weeds. The 737 came to rest 1634 feet past the end of the runway. There were no fatalities and 18 passengers and one crew member sustained injuries among the 61 on board. The aircraft was damaged beyond economical repair. This was the first hull loss of a Boeing 737.
* On June 23, 1976, Allegheny Airlines Flight 121, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, crash landed at PHL on final approach when encountering wind shear during a thunderstorm. There were 86 injuries out of the 4 crew and 102 passengers on board, but no fatalities. The aircraft was substantially damaged when it slid down the runway after touchdown, and was written off.

* On February 7, 2006, a UPS Airlines Douglas DC-8 cargo plane suffered an in-flight cargo fire and made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport after filling with smoke. There were no injuries other than smoke inhalation affecting the crew, but the plane burned on the ground for hours into the night, though most of the cargo survived, the aircraft was a total loss, with multiple holes burned through the roof skin. According to the NTSB, the firefighting crew did not have adequate training on using their skin-piercing extinguishing equipment and not knowing how to open the main cargo door, attempted to force the handle and broke the latch, rendering the door unopenable. There were also difficulties in obtaining the cargo manifest to determine what if any hazardous materials were on board, due to confusion about protocol. However, despite these failings, the airport staff, including the firefighting staff, managed the incident successfully without injury or major disruption of the airport. The NTSB suspected lithium-ion batteries were the source of ignition and made recommendations for more stringent rules and restrictions on their air transport, especially on passenger aircraft (unlike this one). For a cause of the incident, the NTSB focused on the delayed indication of fire by the required onboard fire detection system and criticized the standards to which such systems are tested, noting that the tests use an empty cargo hold and do not represent the real-world performance of the detection systems with the hold full of cargo, which significantly changes the flow patterns of hot air and smoke. The crew and air traffic control personnel were found to have behaved properly (with minor exceptions) and not to be at fault for the incident or its outcome. 
*On March 13, 2014, US Airways Flight 1702, an Airbus A320-214, rotated then aborted takeoff and as a result suffered a tailstrike and a nose landing gear collapse. The aircraft then continued down runway 27L coming to a stop off to the left of the runway. None of the 149 passengers and 5 crew members suffered life-threatening injuries. However, the aircraft saw substantial damage and was later written off. The aircraft was stored at the airport until 2021 when it was finally removed from the airport for scrapping.
* On April 17, 2018, Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, a Boeing 737-700 en route from New York to Dallas, suffered an engine failure on its left engine. Debris from the engine struck the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and a side window. The window failed, causing a rapid depressurization of the aircraft, which made an emergency descent and diverted to land at Philadelphia International Airport. One passenger died after being partially ejected from the failed window. Seven others were injured and treated locally at the airport.

<text>The Mid-States Football Association (MSFA) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The conference sponsors only football. Member institutions are located in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. The MSFA was organized in 1993, and on-field competition began in 1994. The conference is divided into two leagues, the Mideast League and the Midwest League. The two MSFA league champions each earn an automatic bid to the NAIA football national championship playoffs. MSFA member schools have won eight NAIA football national championships.

For other sports, MSFA-member schools are affiliated with a variety of other conferences including the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference, the Crossroads League, and the Wolverine–Hoosier Athletic Conference.

<doc id="262565" wikidata="Q7875121" url="?curid=262565" title="USS Virginia (1776)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Virginia&quot; was a 28-gun sailing frigate of the Continental Navy, a ship with a short and unfortunate career.

She was one of 13 frigates authorized by the Continental Congress on 13 December 1775, laid down in 1776 at Fells Point, Maryland, by George Wells, launched that August, and commissioned in the spring of 1777, Captain James Nicholson in command.

The newly commissioned frigate&#x27;s first orders directed her to attempt a run through the strong British naval blockade at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay and then if successful, to head south to the West Indies and cruise in search of English merchantmen. However, her first sortie failed, as did four subsequent attempts to get to sea which she made in May, October, November, and December 1777. These successive failures frustrated &quot;Virginia&#x27;s&quot; restive crew, and many deserted to join the numerous privateers scattered about the wharves of nearby Baltimore.

By early January 1778, the desertions had become so numerous that &quot;Virginia&quot; was unable to leave the docks. This situation prompted a series of ugly exchanges between Capt. Nicholson, his executive officer Lt. Joshua Barney, and the governor of Maryland Thomas Johnson. New recruits were finally procured through the auspices of the Maritime Committee of the Continental Congress, enabling &quot;Virginia&quot; to attempt another run past the blockade in mid-January. This latest dash went smoothly until sighted &quot;Virginia&quot; near the Chesapeake capes. The British frigate pursued the Americans back towards Baltimore. &quot;Virginia&quot; tied up behind a water battery and chain stretched across the northwest branch of the Patapsco River, Md., between Whetstone Point and later Lazaretto Point, where she took on board 20 more seamen.

Later that month, when Capt. Nicholson again tried to run the blockade, he sent Lt. Barney ahead in the schooner &quot;Dolphin&quot; to reconnoiter the positions of the British warships. &quot;Dolphin&quot; sighted a large patrol vessel in Tangier Sound but outran her. Before meeting with &quot;Virginia&quot;, the schooner recaptured a Baltimore sloop taken earlier. On the basis of Lt. Barney&#x27;s report, Capt. Nicholson decided to abandon this latest attempt to get to sea and returned to Baltimore.

&quot;Virginia&quot; lay at anchor at Baltimore for two months repairing and reprovisioning. During this time, Barney was dispatched to York, Pennsylvania, to explain &quot;Virginia&#x27;s&quot; predicament to the Maritime Committee; and he returned in March with orders to make another attempt to get by the British as soon as possible. Awaiting Barney upon his arrival back in Baltimore were a letter of thanks from the Royal Navy for his kind treatment of &quot;Dolphin&#x27;s&quot; prisoners and a large English cheese.

&quot;Virginia&quot; left Baltimore late in March in obedience to the Maritime Committee&#x27;s orders. Nicholson&#x27;s plans called for &quot;Virginia&quot; to sail first to Annapolis, to pick up a bay pilot promised by Governor Johnson. Completing this, the frigate and pilot vessel weighed anchor off Annapolis on 30 March and proceeded down the bay, plotting a night passage into the Atlantic. However, early on the morning of 31 March, &quot;Virginia&quot; grounded with a tremendous crash on the so-called Middle Ground between the capes, opposite the city of Hampton, Virginia. With a strong wind blowing astern, the surf pounded the frigate and forced her over. Her rudder snapped before she could be cleared and was soon lost. Once in the channel, &quot;Virginia&quot; was anchored and repairs begun.

At dawn, lookouts spotted &quot;Emerald&quot; and her fellow frigate approaching from seaward though &quot;Virginia&#x27;s&quot; guns remained undamaged, Capt. Nicholson ordered his barge broken out and went ashore with the ship&#x27;s papers. Later that morning, the American frigate surrendered to Capt. Caldwell of &quot;Emerald&quot;. A Congressional court of inquiry into the fiasco cleared Capt. Nicholson of blame, and all the officers of the unlucky frigate saw action later during the Revolution.

&quot;Virginia&quot; herself was soon repaired and eventually purchased by the Royal Navy for use as the 32-gun frigate HMS &quot;Virginia&quot;. She was placed in service along the American coast and participated in the Penobscot Expedition of 1779, capturing, with HMS Blonde, the privateer &quot;Hampden&quot;. Later participated in the capture of Charles Town, South Carolina in 1780. At the end of the war she was condemned and sold.

<text>Tampa International Airport is an international airport west of Downtown Tampa, in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. The airport is publicly owned by Hillsborough County Aviation Authority (HCAA). The airport serves 100 non-stop destinations throughout North America, South America, the Caribbean and Europe across multiple carriers.

==History==
===Flying boat===
Tampa Bay is the birthplace of commercial airline service, when pioneer aviator Tony Jannus flew the inaugural flight of the St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line on January 1, 1914, from St. Petersburg to Tampa using a Benoist Flying Boat—the first scheduled commercial airline flight in the world using a heavier-than-air airplane.

===Drew Field===

In 1928, the city completed the Drew Field west of Downtown Tampa. It was named for local developer John H. Drew, who formerly owned the land on which the airport stood. The more popular Peter O. Knight Airport was opened on Davis Islands near Downtown Tampa in 1935, where both Eastern and National Airlines operated until 1946.

The United States Army Air Corps began negotiating for the use of Drew Field in 1939 during the buildup of military forces prior to World War II. In 1940, the City of Tampa leased Drew Field to the U.S. Government for 25 years, or until the end of the &quot;national emergency&quot;. During the war, the United States Army Air Forces expanded and modernized the airport. The airfield was used by the Third Air Force and renamed it Drew Army Airfield. The Third Air Force used it as a training center by 120,000 combat air crews, primarily in bomber aircraft for the European and Pacific theaters, and also flew locally based antisubmarine patrols from the airfield until that mission was fully taken over by Naval Aviation assets of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. There was one mishap in 1943 that killed five fliers. Despite this, Drew Field set a safety record for the Third Air Force in 1945 after 100,000 flying hours had been completed over a period of 10 months without a fatal incident. The aircraft operated included the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Douglas C-47 Skytrain, North American AT-6, North American B-25 Mitchell, and others.

After World War II, the Army Air Forces vacated the facility and Drew Field was returned to the City of Tampa. The Peter O. Knight Airport and Drew Field reversed roles as the main Tampa airport because Drew Field was greatly expanded by the United States Army Air Forces during the war years. Airlines (Eastern Air Lines and National Airlines) moved to Drew Field from Peter O. Knight Airport on Davis Island, which was too small to handle the Douglas DC-4, DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation prop-liners then coming on line in the mid-1940s. During this period, the airlines were housed in the former Drew AAF Base Operations building.

===Tampa International Airport===

Trans Canada Airlines international flights began in 1950 and Drew Field was renamed Tampa International Airport. The airport&#x27;s second terminal opened in 1952 near the intersection of Columbus Drive and West Shore Blvd. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 30 departures a day on Eastern Air Lines: nonstops to Chicago-Midway, Detroit (Willow Run), Cleveland, New York Idlewild (now JFK), Boston, seven nonstops to Atlanta and 18 within Florida. National Airlines had 26 departures, including seven nonstops beyond Florida to Houston Hobby, Havana, Washington National, New York/Idlewild and three to New Orleans. Trans-Eastern had 12 departures and Mackey had two DC-3s, none nonstop beyond Florida. Trans-Canada had thirteen nonstops a week to Toronto or Montreal.

The 1952 terminal, built for three airlines, was swamped after the Civil Aeronautics Board granted Capital, Delta, Northeast, Northwest and Trans World Airlines authority to fly from Tampa in the late 1950s. An annex was built east of the terminal for the new carriers. Turbine-powered flights began in 1959 on Eastern Air Lines&#x27; L-188 Electra; in 1960 National, Eastern and Delta Air Lines began jet flights with the Douglas DC-8 (Delta was first, with a Chicago nonstop in May or June). National DC-8 nonstops to Los Angeles and weekly Pan American jets to Mexico City (MIA-TPA-MID-MEX) started in 1961. The 1952 terminal was congested as larger jets replaced piston airliners and it was again expanded.

During the early 1960s, the aviation authority began planning a replacement terminal in an undeveloped site at the airport. Airport leaders chose the Landside/Airside design in 1965 after a study. Construction on the new terminal designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills began in 1968 between the airport&#x27;s parallel jet-capable runways. Days before its opening, the terminal was dedicated by Florida Governor Reubin Askew and 60,000 people toured the new facility during a two-day open house. The terminal opened for passenger traffic on April 15, 1971 with four airside satellites (Airsides B, C, D, and E). National Airlines Flight 36 from Los Angeles was the first to arrive at the terminal; after touching down at 05:26 A.M., the jet taxied to Airside E.

The graphics and signage system designed by Jane Davis Doggett used red for one group of airlines and blue for another. The red/blue color scheme began on the highway outside the airport and helped guide drivers to the proper dropoff areas for each airline, then continued to guide passengers through the airport itself and ultimately to their gate. The Tampa Airport was the first airport to use this sort of color-coded wayfinding signage system which was safer for drivers and required many fewer signs than highway engineers had originally budgeted for.

The logo, used since the new airport opened in 1971, represents the blue waters of Tampa Bay with a jetliner flying into the downtown Tampa sunset. It is known as the &quot;Spirit of Flight&quot;. The jetliner was modeled after those once used for supersonic transport—at the time the logo was created in the 1970s, it was during an era when it was thought that supersonic aircraft would replace conventional jets as a mode of air travel.

In its early years, the 1971 terminal would also see large amounts of tourists heading to Walt Disney World, which also opened in 1971. This was due to the fact that Orlando International Airport (known then as Orlando Jetport at McCoy) was much smaller at the time with a more limited capacity. Shawnee Airlines offered connecting flights from Tampa to the now-defunct Walt Disney World Airport in the 1970s. Orlando International opened its current terminal in 1981 using the same well-received landside/airside layout as Tampa International Airport.

On July 15, 1972, the air traffic control tower opened, the tallest in the United States at the time. The Host/Marriott Airport Hotel and its revolving rooftop restaurant opened in December 1973, with triple-paned windows and sound-proof guest rooms.

Northwest Airlines and National Airlines brought the jumbo jet to the airport late in 1971 with the introduction of the Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10. This was followed by the L-1011 Lockheed Tristar a year later by Eastern Air Lines. National Airlines began trans Atlantic DC-10 service to Amsterdam and Paris in 1977.

===Recent history===
During the following decades, the airport was expanded to handle more traffic and additional airlines. In 1987, the terminal received its first major expansion with the opening of Airside F. Airside B closed permanently in 1991 following the demise of Eastern Air Lines. Airside A was subsequently built and opened in 1995. In 1996, Airsides C and D were temporarily closed and remodeled, and the interiors of both satellites were refurbished. During this time, all the airlines from both facilities were housed in Airside E. Upon completion of the renovations, the airlines returned to their original locations, and Airside E was permanently closed. Airside E sat dormant for a few years before eventually being demolished, with the current Airside E opening in 2002. The Landside Terminal was also remodeled multiple times during the 1980s and 1990s. Airside C and the abandoned Airside B were demolished in the mid-2000s, with the current Airside C opening in 2005. Airside D, the last original airside, was then closed permanently and was demolished in 2007. A new Airside D is currently under construction and is set to open in 2028.

Both Delta Air Lines and US Airways opened maintenance bases at the airport. Both bases closed during the air travel downturn following the attacks of September 11, 2001. Alabama-based Pemco World Air Services now occupies the former US Airways hangar performing MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) services for the Spirit Airlines and JetBlue A320 fleet. On April 1, 2010 a press release announced that a lease agreement was reached to allow Pemco to lease the second hangar formerly used by Delta Air Lines, where they perform Boeing 737 cargo conversions and modifications.

Phase I of the economy parking garage was completed in November 2005.
Phase II of the economy garage opened ahead of schedule in November 2005, bringing a total of 5,600 parking spaces.

On March 7, 2011, federal officials gave TPA the green light to begin charter flights to Cuba as an official entry/exit point.

In 2007 and 2008, Zagat Survey ranked TPA the Best Overall U.S. Airport, while placing it second-best overall in 2009 and 2010. In 2008 &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; recognized TPA as the second-best airport in the world, just two tenths of a point behind the first-place winner. JD Power and Associates have also given TPA Airport consistently high customer-satisfaction ratings over the years. In November 2011, CNN ranked TPA sixth among ten of the world&#x27;s most loved airports, being the only one on the list from the US. In 2016, it was named one of the Top 3 airports in the country by &quot;Condé Nast&quot;. In 2020 Airports Council International named TPA the best airport in North America for its size. In 2024, Travel+Leisure ranked TPA the eighth best domestic airport in the US. Criteria for the rankings were based on access, check-in, restaurants,shopping, and design, and rated from excellent to poor. Readers of the magazine were involved in the survey. Palm Beach International Airport, another Florida airport, made the list (#3) as well.

In August 2022, a 21-foot flamingo sculpture named &quot;HOME&quot; nicknamed &quot;Phoebe&quot;, was installed and opened in Tampa International Airport&#x27;s main terminal. The design from American artist Matthew Mazzotta was chosen out of 734 art proposals submitted from around the world.

In February 2024, Joe Lopano, the CEO credited with leading Tampa&#x27;s improvement as a hub, announced plans to retire. At the same time, the airport&#x27;s board announced it would be undergoing an internal search for a replacement.

Currently, plans are underway to construct a new Airside D in the northwest area of TPA. This new airside will feature 16 gates to handle both international and domestic flights, as well as two new airline lounges, one of which will be operated by Delta Airlines, the anchor tenant of Airside D. It will help TPA serve up to 35 million annual passengers by 2037. Groundbreaking of the airside occurred in December 2024, with the airside scheduled to open to the public in 2028. 

On February 3, 2025, it was announced that Delta Airlines was selected to be the anchor tenant of the new Airside D, and operate one of the airside&#x27;s two lounge spaces.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
Tampa International Airport&#x27;s Landside/Airside terminal was the first of its type in the world. There is a central Landside Terminal where baggage and ticketing functions take place. The Landside Terminal is surrounded by four Airside satellites where airliner embarkment and disembarkment occur. Each Airside is connected to the Landside Terminal via an elevated automated people mover (APM) system which employs 16 Bombardier Innovia APM 100 Shuttle Cars, which are in the process of being replaced to Bombardier Innovia APM 300R C801B. TPA was the first airport in the world to deploy a fully automated, driver-free people mover system and is host to Bombardier Transportation&#x27;s longest-running APM system. There are four active airsides (A, C, E, and F) with 59 gates. All were constructed after 1985 and all airsides include a food court and gift shop, as well as outdoor smoking patios. Airsides E and F contain duty-free shops in addition to the regular gift shops to serve passengers arriving or departing on international flights. 

Additionally, a fifth airside (Airside D) is currently under construction as part of the airport&#x27;s Master Plan Phase III. 

*Airside A contains 16 gates.
*Airside C contains 16 gates.
*Airside D (Opening 2028) will contain 16 gates. 
*Airside E contains 13 gates.
*Airside F contains 14 gates.

=== Runways ===
Tampa International Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has three runways: 10/28 is 6,999 by 150 feet (2,133 × 46 m) with an Asphalt/concrete surface; 19L/1R is 8,300 by 150 feet (2,530 × 46 m) with an Asphalt/concrete surface; 19R/1L is 11,002 by 150 feet (3,353 × 46 m) with a concrete surface. On January 13, 2011 the runway designations changed due to a shift in the magnetic headings. 09/27 became 10/28, 18R/36L became 1L/19R, 18L/36R became 1R/19L.

===Service building===
When the airport opened its doors in 1971, the service building went into operation as well. It housed the first communications center, police dispatch, employee cafeteria and maintenance locker rooms. The building is located across from the Red Baggage and Ticketing levels. It was primarily intended to house mechanical equipment such as the chiller plant and electrical transformers. Since then it has been expanded to two levels which was in the original design in 1968. Today it houses the original facilities with the addition of offices, rental car counters, badging and a receptionist desk. The police department/lost and found has a lobby on level two (ticketing level) for walk-in lost &amp; found requests.

===Ground transportation===
On February 14, 2018, a new 2.6-million-square-foot Rental Car Center with space for 5,300 vehicles, was opened to the public. The new combined service and maintenance facility is located near the southern edge of airport property and is connected to the terminal via a new train called SkyConnect. Unlike the landside/airside shuttles, SkyConnect uses Mitsubishi Crystal Mover vehicles. The trains run between the three stations in a pinched-loop configuration. Passengers on most domestic flights also have the ability to check their luggage inside the Rental Car Center. Rental car services were originally located adjacent to the Landside terminal, near the long-term-parking structure; however, relocation was necessary to accommodate more cars and rental car companies as the facilities were at or near capacity.

On the southwest end of the Rental Car Center is a canopy and platform that is used for both Hillsborough Area Regional Transit and Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority bus services. The bus hub is accessible via a bank of elevators that connect directly to the Rental Car Center and is steps away from the SkyConnect station. With the upcoming 2nd phase of expansion at the airport, the intent is to expand upon the existing platform to eventually allow bus services from Pasco and perhaps even Hernando Counties to connect into the airport directly. The land immediately to the south of the Rental Car Center can also be configured for future light rail or commuter rail services if plans come to fruition.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On March 9, 1943, five USAAF flight crew were killed when their Martin B-26 Marauder crashed on a flight from Avon Park Auxiliary Field to Eglin Field. The pilot attempted an emergency landing at Drew Field and overshot the runway. Two others on board the B-26 survived. This occurred one hour after a USAAF Douglas A-24 flying out of Drew Field crashed in Mullet Key near St. Petersburg, a bombing range at the time. The pilot ditched the airplane and lived, but the gunner bailed out and drowned.
* On August 5, 1969, a passenger on an Eastern Air Lines McDonnell Douglas DC-9 on Flight 379 from Charlotte was arrested upon arrival after he entered the cockpit en route and told the pilot, &quot;Let&#x27;s go to Cuba&quot;; the pilot said there wasn&#x27;t enough fuel so the passenger returned to his seat. The hijacker later claimed he &quot;wanted to see if he had the nerve to simulate a hijacking&quot; and did not want to actually go to Cuba.
* On September 25, 1973, a Rockwell 1121B Jet Commander (N200RC) owned by Continental Jet Corp. was damaged beyond repair in a hangar fire.
* On November 6, 1986, an Eastern Air Lines captain, George Baines, age 56, was flying in his private aircraft, a Piper PA-23 Apache, (registration N2185P) from his home to Tampa International Airport to catch a flight. Captain Baines was cleared for an instrument landing system approach to runway 36L (now 1L) with visibility in dense fog. He was unable to land during his first approach and declared a missed approach and executed a go-around to try again. On the second approach, the Apache touched down on taxiway W, parallel to and about to the right (east) of runway 36L. At the same time, a Pan American Boeing B-727 was proceeding southbound on taxiway W. When the captain of the Pan-Am 727 saw the Apache emerge from the dense fog directly in front of him, he turned to the right (west) in an attempt to avoid the impending collision. About two seconds later, the Apache&#x27;s left engine struck the B-727 in the radome, which is a structural, weatherproof enclosure that protects a radar antenna. Two passengers and a flight attendant were injured after they evacuated the aircraft. The Apache was almost destroyed and the pilot, the sole occupant of the aircraft, was killed. The primary causes of this accident was determined by the NTSB to include the pilot&#x27;s decision to continue his approach below decision height when the visibility was below landing minimums and the adequacy of current Federal regulations that allow pilots operating under Part 91 to conduct approaches when the reported visibility is below published minimum visibility for land.
* On December 1, 1993, a Cessna 650 Citation III (N700RR) operated by Consolidated International Services Inc. was landing when it collided with a cement pad while taxiing back to the grass taxiway, collapsing the nose gear. The plane had just arrived from a 2 hour 15 minute flight from Morristown, New Jersey. The cause was determined to be the pilot&#x27;s decision to leave the taxiway with improper wiring of the anti-skid system. The plane was later repaired.
* On April 2, 2017, an Air Canada Jetz Airbus A319-114 (C-GBHN) was struck while parked by a motor coach during pre-departure setup for Flight 7042 to Fort Lauderdale. Substantial damage occurred on the port side of the fuselage and the left outer flap track. No injuries occurred onboard; the flight was cancelled. The aircraft was later repaired.

<text>Laelian (; ), also incorrectly referred to as &quot;Lollianus&quot; and &quot;Aelianus&quot;, was a usurper against Postumus, the emperor of the Gallic Empire. His revolt lasted from approximately late February to early June 269.

==Origins==
Little is known about Laelian. He shares the same &quot;nomen&quot; as a prominent Hispano-Roman family, the Ulpii, that included Trajan among its members, and may have been a relative. This is supported by the strong allusion to Hispania on an aureus he struck, which featured the design of Hispania reclining with a rabbit to her side. If he indeed was a relative, this may be the reason Hispania allied itself with Claudius II, after the death of Laelian, seemingly without a struggle.

==Rule==
Laelian declared himself emperor at Moguntiacum (modern-day Mainz in Germany) in February/March 269, after repulsing a Germanic invasion. Although his exact position is unknown, he is believed to have been a senior officer under Postumus, either the &quot;legatus&quot; of Germania Superior or the commander of Legio XXII &quot;Primigenia&quot;. Laelian represented a strong danger to Postumus because of the two legions he commanded (&quot;Primigenia&quot; in Moguntiacum and VIII &quot;Augusta&quot; in Argentoratum); Despite this, his rebellion lasted only about two months before he was executed, reputedly by his own soldiers, or by Postumus&#x27; troops after a siege of Laelian&#x27;s capital. The siege of Moguntiacum was also fatal for Postumus; it is said he was slain when he refused to allow his troops to plunder the city following its capture.

Laelian (under the Latin name &quot;Lollianus&quot;) is listed among the Thirty Tyrants in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;.

<doc id="262572" wikidata="Q2002035" url="?curid=262572" title="Ventricle (heart)">
<text>A ventricle is one of two large chambers located toward the bottom of the heart that collect and expel blood towards the peripheral beds within the body and lungs. The blood pumped by a ventricle is supplied by an atrium, an adjacent chamber in the upper heart that is smaller than a ventricle. Interventricular means between the ventricles (for example the interventricular septum), while intraventricular means within one ventricle (for example an intraventricular block).

In a four-chambered heart, such as that in humans, there are two ventricles that operate in a double circulatory system: the right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood into the systemic circulation through the aorta.

==Structure==

Ventricles have thicker walls than atria and generate higher blood pressures. The physiological load on the ventricles requiring pumping of blood throughout the body and lungs is much greater than the pressure generated by the atria to fill the ventricles. Further, the left ventricle has thicker walls than the right because it needs to pump blood to most of the body while the right ventricle fills only the lungs.

On the inner walls of the ventricles are irregular muscular columns called trabeculae carneae which cover all of the inner ventricular surfaces except that of the conus arteriosus, in the right ventricle. There are three types of these muscles. The third type, the papillary muscles, give origin at their apices to the chordae tendinae which attach to the cusps of the tricuspid valve and to the mitral valve.

The mass of the left ventricle, as estimated by magnetic resonance imaging, averages 143 g ± 38.4 g, with a range of 87–224 g.

The right ventricle is equal in size to the left ventricle and contains roughly 85 millilitres (3 imp fl oz; 3 US fl oz) in the adult. Its upper front surface is circled and convex, and forms much of the sternocostal surface of the heart. Its under surface is flattened, forming part of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart that rests upon the diaphragm.

Its posterior wall is formed by the ventricular septum, which bulges into the right ventricle, so that a transverse section of the cavity presents a semilunar outline. Its upper and left angle forms a conical pouch, the conus arteriosus, from which the pulmonary artery arises. A tendinous band, called the tendon of the conus arteriosus, extends upward from the right atrioventricular fibrous ring and connects the posterior surface of the conus arteriosus to the aorta.

===Shape===

The left ventricle is longer and more conical in shape than the right, and on transverse section its concavity presents an oval or nearly circular outline. It forms a small part of the sternocostal surface and a considerable part of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart; it also forms the apex of the heart. The left ventricle is thicker and more muscular than the right ventricle because it pumps blood at a higher pressure.

The right ventricle is triangular in shape and extends from the tricuspid valve in the right atrium to near the apex of the heart. Its wall is thickest at the apex and thins towards its base at the atrium. When viewed via cross section however, the right ventricle seems to be crescent shaped. The right ventricle is made of two components: the sinus and the conus. The Sinus is the inflow which flows away from the tricuspid valve. Three bands made from muscle, separate the right ventricle: the parietal, the septal, and the moderator band. The moderator band connects from the base of the anterior papillary muscle to the ventricular septum.

===Development===
By young adulthood, the walls of the left ventricle have thickened from three to six times greater than that of the right ventricle. This reflects the typical five times greater pressure workload this chamber performs while accepting blood returning from the pulmonary veins at ~80mmHg pressure (equivalent to around 11 kPa) and pushing it forward to the typical ~120mmHg pressure (around 16.3 kPa) in the aorta during each heartbeat. (The pressures stated are resting values and stated as relative to surrounding atmospheric which is the typical &quot;0&quot; reference pressure used in medicine.)

==Function==
During systole, the ventricles contract, pumping blood through the body. During diastole, the ventricles relax and fill with blood again.

The left ventricle receives oxygenated blood from the left atrium via the mitral valve and pumps it through the aorta via the aortic valve, into the systemic circulation. The left ventricular muscle must relax and contract quickly and be able to increase or lower its pumping capacity under the control of the nervous system. In the diastolic phase, it has to relax very quickly after each contraction so as to quickly fill with the oxygenated blood flowing from the pulmonary veins. Likewise in the systolic phase, the left ventricle must contract rapidly and forcibly to pump this blood into the aorta, overcoming the much higher aortic pressure. The extra pressure exerted is also needed to stretch the aorta and other arteries to accommodate the increase in blood volume.

The right ventricle receives deoxygenated blood from the right atrium via the tricuspid valve and pumps it into the pulmonary artery via the pulmonary valve, into the pulmonary circulation.

===Pumping volume===
The typical healthy adult heart pumping volume is ~5 liters/min, resting. Maximum capacity pumping volume extends from ~25 liters/min for non-athletes to as high as ~45 liters/min for Olympic level athletes.

===Volumes===
In cardiology, the performance of the ventricles are measured with several volumetric parameters, including end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (Ef).


===Pressures===
Ventricular pressure is a measure of blood pressure within the ventricles of the heart.

====Left====
During most of the cardiac cycle, ventricular pressure is less than the pressure in the aorta, but during systole, the ventricular pressure rapidly increases, and the two pressures become equal to each other (represented by the junction of the blue and red lines on the diagram on this page), the aortic valve opens, and blood is pumped to the body.

Elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure has been described as a risk factor in cardiac surgery.

Noninvasive approximations have been described.

An elevated pressure difference between the aortic pressure and the left ventricular pressure may be indicative of aortic stenosis.

====Right====
Right ventricular pressure demonstrates a different pressure-volume loop than left ventricular pressure.
===Dimensions===
The heart and its performance are also commonly measured in terms of &quot;dimensions&quot;, which in this case means one-dimensional distances, usually measured in millimeters. This is not as informative as volumes but may be much easier to estimate with (e.g., M-Mode echocardiography or with sonomicrometry, which is mostly used for animal model research). Optimally, it is specified with which plane the distance is measured in, e.g. the dimension of the longitudinal plane.

Fractional shortening (FS) is the fraction of any diastolic dimension that is lost in systole. When referring to endocardial luminal distances, it is EDD minus ESD divided by EDD (times 100 when measured in percentage). Normal values may differ somewhat dependent on which anatomical plane is used to measure the distances. Normal range is 25–45%, Mild is 20–25%, Moderate is 15–20%, and Severe is &lt;15%. Cardiology Diagnostic Tests Midwall fractional shortening may also be used to measure diastolic/systolic changes for inter-ventricular septal dimensions and posterior wall dimensions. However, both endocardial and midwall fractional shortening are dependent on myocardial wall thickness, and thereby dependent on long-axis function.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00153.2009&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a measure of short-axis function termed epicardial volume change (EVC) is independent of myocardial wall thickness and represents isolated short-axis function.

==Clinical significance==
An arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat that can occur in the ventricles or atria. Normally the heartbeat is initiated in the SA node of the atrium but initiation can also occur in the Purkinje fibres of the ventricles, giving rise to premature ventricular contractions, also called ventricular extra beats. When these beats become grouped the condition is known as ventricular tachycardia.

Another form of arrhythmia is that of the ventricular escape beat. This can happen as a compensatory mechanism when there is a problem in the conduction system from the SA node.

The most severe form of arrhythmia is ventricular fibrillation which is the most common cause of cardiac arrest and subsequent sudden death.

<doc id="262573" wikidata="Q929313" url="?curid=262573" title="Cardiac tamponade">
<text>Cardiac tamponade, also known as pericardial tamponade (), is a compression of the heart due to pericardial effusion (the build-up of pericardial fluid in the sac around the heart). Onset may be rapid or gradual. Symptoms typically include those of obstructive shock including shortness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, and cough. Other symptoms may relate to the underlying cause.
Common causes of cardiac tamponade include cancer, kidney failure, chest trauma, myocardial infarction, and pericarditis. Other causes include connective tissues diseases, hypothyroidism, aortic rupture, autoimmune disease, and complications of cardiac surgery. In Africa, tuberculosis is a relatively common cause.
Diagnosis may be suspected based on low blood pressure, jugular venous distension, or quiet heart sounds (together known as Beck&#x27;s triad). A pericardial rub may be present in cases due to inflammation. The diagnosis may be further supported by specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, chest X-ray, or an ultrasound of the heart. If fluid increases slowly the pericardial sac can expand to contain more than 2 liters; however, if the increase is rapid, as little as 200 mL can result in tamponade.
Tamponade is a medical emergency. When it results in symptoms, drainage is necessary. This can be done by pericardiocentesis, surgery to create a pericardial window, or a pericardiectomy. Drainage may also be necessary to rule out infection or cancer. Other treatments may include the use of dobutamine or in those with low blood volume, intravenous fluids. Those with few symptoms and no worrisome features can often be closely followed. The frequency of tamponade is unclear. One estimate from the United States places it at 2 per 10,000 per year.

==Signs and symptoms==
Onset may be rapid (acute) or more gradual (subacute). Signs of cardiac tamponade typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shortness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, cough and those of Beck&#x27;s triad e.g. jugular vein distention, quiet heart sounds and hypotension. Other symptoms may relate to the underlying cause.

Other general signs of shock (such as fast heart rate, shortness of breath and decreasing level of consciousness) may also occur. However, some of these signs may not be present in certain cases. A fast heart rate, although expected, may be absent in people with uremia and hypothyroidism.

According to Reddy and co-authors, cardiac tamponade and its progression can be described in 3 different phases. In phase I, the required filling pressure increases due to the high stiffness of the ventricles. This is because of the accumulation of pericardial fluid in the pericardial cavity. During phase II, the pericardial pressure exceeds the ventricular filling pressure caused by the further accumulation of pericardial fluid. This results in a decrease in cardiac input and output. A further decrease of cardiac input and output is typical in phase III of the progression of cardiac tamponade. This is caused by the equilibration of left ventricular filling and pericardial pressure, leading to “severe deterioration of end-organ perfusion.” Some of the symptoms, as a consequence, include abdominal pain due to liver engorgement.

==Causes==
Cardiac tamponade is caused by a large or uncontrolled pericardial effusion, i.e. the buildup of fluid inside the pericardium. This commonly occurs as a result of chest trauma (both blunt and penetrating), but can also be caused by myocardial infarction, myocardial rupture, cancer (most often Hodgkin lymphoma), uremia, pericarditis, or cardiac surgery, and rarely occurs during retrograde aortic dissection, or while the person is taking anticoagulant therapy. The effusion can occur rapidly (as in the case of trauma or myocardial rupture), or over a more gradual period of time (as in cancer). The fluid involved is often blood, but pus is also found in some circumstances.

===Surgery===

One of the most common settings for cardiac tamponade is in the first 7 days after heart surgery. After heart surgery, chest tubes are placed to drain blood. These chest tubes, however, are prone to clot formation. When a chest tube becomes occluded or clogged, the blood that should be drained can accumulate around the heart, leading to tamponade.

==Pathophysiology==

The pericardium, the double-walled sac surrounding the heart, consists of a fibrous pericardium layer on the outside and a double-layered serous pericardium on the inside. Between the two layers of the serous pericardium is the pericardial space, which is filled with lubricating serous fluid that prevents friction as the heart contracts. The outer layer of the heart is made of fibrous tissue which does not easily stretch, so once excess fluid begins to enter the pericardial space, pressure starts to increase. Consequently, the heart becomes compressed due to its inability to fully relax.

If fluid continues to accumulate, each successive diastolic period leads to less blood entering the ventricles. Eventually, increasing pressure on the heart forces the septum to bend in towards the left ventricle, leading to a decrease in stroke volume. This causes the development of obstructive shock, which if left untreated may lead to cardiac arrest (often presenting as pulseless electrical activity). The decrease in stroke volume can also ultimately lead to a decrease in cardiac output, which could be signaled by tachycardia and hypotension.

== Diagnosis ==
The three classic signs, known as Beck&#x27;s triad, are low blood pressure, jugular-venous distension, and muffled heart sounds. Other signs may include pulsus paradoxus (a drop of at least 10 mmHg in arterial blood pressure with inspiration), and ST segment changes on the electrocardiogram, which may also show low voltage QRS complexes.

===Medical imaging===
Tamponade can often be diagnosed radiographically. Echocardiography, which is the diagnostic test of choice, often demonstrates an enlarged pericardium or collapsed ventricles. A large cardiac tamponade will show as an enlarged globular-shaped heart on chest x-ray. During inspiration, the negative pressure in the thoracic cavity will cause increased pressure into the right ventricle. This increased pressure in the right ventricle will cause the interventricular septum to bulge towards the left ventricle, leading to decreased filling of the left ventricle. At the same time, right ventricle volume is markedly diminished and sometimes it can collapse.

===Differential diagnosis===
Initial diagnosis of cardiac tamponade can be challenging, as there is a broad differential diagnosis. The differential includes possible diagnoses based on symptoms, time course, mechanism of injury, patient history. Rapid onset cardiac tamponade may also appear similar to pleural effusions, obstructive shock, shock, pulmonary embolism, and tension pneumothorax.

If symptoms appeared more gradually, the differential diagnosis includes acute heart failure.

In a person with trauma presenting with pulseless electrical activity in the absence of hypovolemia and tension pneumothorax, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade.

In addition to the diagnostic complications afforded by the wide-ranging differential diagnosis for chest pain, diagnosis can be additionally complicated by the fact that people will often be weak or faint at presentation. For instance, a fast rate of breathing and difficulty breathing on exertion that progresses to air hunger at rest can be a key diagnostic symptom, but it may not be possible to obtain such information from people who are unconscious or who have convulsions at presentation.

==Treatment==

===Pre-hospital care===
Initial treatment given will usually be supportive in nature, for example administration of oxygen, and monitoring. There is little care that can be provided pre-hospital other than general treatment for shock. Some teams have performed an emergency thoracotomy to release clotting in the pericardium caused by a penetrating chest injury.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment is the key to survival with tamponade. Some pre-hospital providers will have facilities to provide pericardiocentesis, which can be life-saving. If the person has already suffered a cardiac arrest, pericardiocentesis alone cannot ensure survival, and so rapid evacuation to a hospital is usually the more appropriate course of action.

===Hospital management===
Initial management in hospital is by pericardiocentesis. This involves the insertion of a needle through the skin and into the pericardium and aspirating fluid under ultrasound guidance preferably. This can be done laterally through the intercostal spaces, usually the fifth, or as a subxiphoid approach. A left parasternal approach begins 3 to 5 cm left of the sternum to avoid the left internal mammary artery, in the 5th intercostal space. Often, a cannula is left in place during resuscitation following initial drainage so that the procedure can be performed again if the need arises. If facilities are available, an emergency pericardial window may be performed instead, during which the pericardium is cut open to allow fluid to drain. Following stabilization of the person, surgery is provided to seal the source of the bleed and mend the pericardium.

Following heart surgery, the amount of chest tube drainage is monitored. If the drainage volume drops off, and the blood pressure goes down, this can suggest a tamponade due to chest tube clogging. In that case, the person is taken back to the operating room for an emergency reoperation.

If aggressive treatment is offered immediately and no complications arise (shock, AMI or arrhythmia, heart failure, aneurysm, carditis, embolism, or rupture), or they are dealt with quickly and fully contained, then adequate survival is still a distinct possibility.

==Epidemiology==
The frequency of tamponade is unclear. One estimate from the United States places it at 2 per 10,000 per year. It is estimated to occur in 2% of those with stab or gunshot wounds to the chest.

<text>The continental Navy frigate USS &quot;Deane&quot; was originally a ship secretly ordered by the American Commissioners from the Nantes shipowner .

This 400 ton &#x27;merchant&#x27; ship, then named the Lyon, with 32 gun emplacements, was fitted with 24 cannons and was built by Bourmaud. The number of cannons attracted the attention of the local maritime authorities, who notified the Minister of Marine. Having been paid through a Paris banker, Jean Peltier denied any other use apart from trade, and, on 3 November 1777, indicated in the deed of purchase that there was &quot;absolutely no foreign involvement&quot; and that the ship would be commanded by a Frenchman, Barthélémy Corvaisier, on the voyage to Santo Domingo.

Even though suspicions had not completely disappeared, fortunately French intentions towards the USA had changed and Jean Peltier was encouraged to hasten the preparation of the ship. On 12 February 1778, the &quot;Lyon&quot; joined the &quot;Duc de Choiseul&quot; and the &quot;Brume&quot; in Saint Nazaire to then sail to the Quiberon Bay, where the escort of La Motte-Picquet was waiting to accompany them the 900 km to the United States. However disagreements with Samuel Nicholson led to the departure of a large number of the French crew, including Nicolas Baudin, and the embarkation of 102 American &#x27;passengers&#x27;. An agreement was signed between Jonathan Williams and Nicholson and Corvaisier stepped down. Nicholson took command and renamed the ship the Deane after American Founding Father Silas Deane. On 14 February the crew was present at the 13-gun salute by John Paul Jones fired from the &#x27;Ranger&#x27; and the 9-gun salute in response from La Motte-Picquet, in recognition of the American nation. And brought to the United States in May 1778 to be prepared for sea. She was named Hague in 1782, and was taken out of commission in 1783.

==Career==

Under the command of Captain Samuel Nicholson of the Continental Navy, &quot;Deane&quot; sailed from Boston 14 January 1779 with for a cruise in the West Indies. She returned to Philadelphia 17 April with one prize, the armed ship &quot;Viper&quot;. On 29 July she joined with and two ships of the Virginia Navy guarding a convoy of merchantmen out to sea and continuing on for a five-week cruise which netted eight prizes, including four privateers, the packet &quot;Sandwich&quot;, and the sloop-of-war . The frigates arrived at Boston 6 September with 250 prisoners after one of the most notable cruises of the Continental Navy.

During the winter and early spring of 1781 &quot;Deane&quot; cruised with and in the West Indies. In May, &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; reported that the rebel frigates &quot;Dean&quot; and &quot;Protector&quot; had captured &quot;John&quot;, Ashburner, master, from Lancaster to St. Kitts, and a ship sailing from Glasgow to Jamaica with 90-0 barrels of beef and a quantity of dry goods, and had taken them into Martinique.

&quot;Deane&quot; again cruised with &quot;Confederacy&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; in the West Indies in 1782, capturing four prizes. In April 1782 she captured the cutter . After two more cruises in the Caribbean, one in September 1782 and the other in 1783, she was renamed &quot;Hague&quot; in September 1782 (perhaps because of false accusation against Deane that was current at the time).

==Fate==
&quot;Deane&quot; was taken out of commission in 1783 at Boston.

<text>Stealth technology, also termed low observable technology (LO technology), is a sub-discipline of military tactics and passive and active electronic countermeasures. The term covers a range of methods used to make personnel, aircraft, ships, submarines, missiles, satellites, and ground vehicles less visible (ideally invisible) to radar, infrared, sonar and other detection methods. It corresponds to military camouflage for these parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., multi-spectral camouflage).

Development of modern stealth technologies in the United States began in 1958, where earlier attempts to prevent radar tracking of its U-2 spy planes during the Cold War by the Soviet Union had been unsuccessful. Designers turned to developing a specific shape for planes that tended to reduce detection by redirecting electromagnetic radiation waves from radars. Radiation-absorbent material was also tested and made to reduce or block radar signals that reflect off the surfaces of aircraft. Such changes to shape and surface composition comprise stealth technology as currently used on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit &quot;Stealth Bomber&quot;.

The concept of stealth is to operate or hide while giving enemy forces no indication as to the presence of friendly forces. This concept was first explored through camouflage to make an object&#x27;s appearance blend into the visual background. As the potency of detection and interception technologies (radar, infrared search and tracking, surface-to-air missiles, etc.) have increased, so too has the extent to which the design and operation of military personnel and vehicles have been affected in response. Some military uniforms are treated with chemicals to reduce their infrared signature. A modern &quot;stealth&quot; vehicle is designed from the outset to have a chosen spectral signature. The degree of stealth embodied in a given design is chosen according to the projected threats of detection.

==History==

Camouflage to aid or avoid predation predates humanity, and hunters have been using vegetation to conceal themselves, perhaps as long as people have been hunting. The earliest application of camouflage in warfare is impossible to ascertain. Methods for visual concealment in war were documented by Sun Tzu in his book &quot;The Art of War&quot; in the 5th century BC, and by Frontinus in his work &quot;Strategemata&quot; in the 1st century AD.

In England, irregular units of gamekeepers in the 17th century were the first to adopt drab colours (common in 16th century Irish units) as a form of camouflage, following examples from the continent.

During World War I, the Germans experimented with the use of &quot;Cellon&quot; (Cellulose acetate), a transparent covering material, in an attempt to reduce the visibility of military aircraft. Single examples of the Fokker E.III &quot;Eindecker&quot; fighter monoplane, the Albatros C.I two-seat observation biplane, and the Linke-Hofmann R.I prototype heavy bomber were covered with &quot;Cellon&quot;. However, sunlight glinting from the material made the aircraft even more visible. &quot;Cellon&quot; was also found to degrade quickly from both sunlight and in-flight temperature changes, so the effort to make transparent aircraft ceased.

In 1916, the British modified a small SS class airship for the purpose of night-time reconnaissance over German lines on the Western Front. Fitted with a silenced engine and a black gas bag, the craft was both invisible and inaudible from the ground but several night-time flights over German-held territory produced little useful intelligence and the idea was dropped.

Diffused lighting camouflage, a shipborne form of counter-illumination camouflage, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy from 1941 to 1943. The concept was followed up for aircraft by the Americans and the British: in 1945, a Grumman Avenger with Yehudi lights reached from a ship before being sighted. This ability was rendered obsolete by radar.

Chaff was invented in Britain and Germany early in World War II as a means to hide aircraft from radar. In effect, chaff acted upon radio waves much as a smoke screen acted upon visible light.

The U-boat &quot;U-480&quot; may have been the first stealth submarine. It featured an anechoic tile rubber coating, one layer of which contained circular air pockets to defeat ASDIC sonar. Radar-absorbent paints and materials of rubber and semiconductor composites (codenames: &quot;Sumpf&quot;, &quot;Schornsteinfeger&quot;) were used by the Kriegsmarine on submarines in World War II. Tests showed they were effective in reducing radar signatures at both short (centimetres) and long (1.5 metre) wavelengths.

In 1956, the CIA began attempts to reduce the radar cross-section (RCS) of the U-2 spyplane. Three systems were developed, Trapeze, a series of wires and ferrite beads around the planform of the aircraft, a covering material with PCB circuitry embedded in it, and radar-absorbent paint. These were deployed in the field on the so-called &quot;dirty birds&quot; but results were disappointing, the weight and drag increases were not worth any reduction in detection rates. More successful was applying camouflage paint to the originally bare metal aircraft; a deep blue was found to be most effective. The weight of this cost 250 ft in maximum altitude, but made the aircraft harder for interceptors to see.

In 1958, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency requested funding for a reconnaissance aircraft to replace the existing U-2 spy planes, and Lockheed secured contractual rights to produce it. &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson and his team at Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works were assigned to produce the A-12 (or OXCART), which operated at high altitude of and speed of to avoid radar detection. Various plane shapes designed to reduce radar detection were developed in earlier prototypes, named A-1 to A-11. The A-12 included a number of stealthy features including special fuel to reduce the signature of the exhaust plume, canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall finish in radar-absorbent paint.

In 1960, the USAF reduced the radar cross-section of a Ryan Q-2C Firebee drone. This was achieved through specially designed screens over the air intake, and radiation-absorbent material on the fuselage, and radar-absorbent paint.

The United States Army issued a specification in 1968 which called for an observation aircraft that would be acoustically undetectable from the ground when flying at an altitude of at night. This resulted in the Lockheed YO-3A Quiet Star, which operated in South Vietnam from late June 1970 to September 1971.

During the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Defense launched project Lockheed Have Blue, with the aim of developing a stealth fighter. There was fierce bidding between Lockheed and Northrop to secure the multibillion-dollar contract. Lockheed incorporated into its bid a text written by the Soviet-Russian physicist Pyotr Ufimtsev from 1962, titled &quot;Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction&quot;, Soviet Radio, Moscow, 1962. In 1971, this book was translated into English with the same title by the U.S. Air Force, Foreign Technology Division. The theory played a critical role in the design of American stealth-aircraft F-117 and B-2. Equations outlined in the paper quantified how a plane&#x27;s shape would affect its detectability by radar, termed radar cross-section (RCS). At the time, the Soviet Union did not have supercomputer capacity to solve these equations for actual designs. This was applied by Lockheed in computer simulation to design a novel shape they called the &quot;Hopeless Diamond&quot;, a wordplay on the Hope Diamond, securing contractual rights to produce the F-117 Nighthawk starting in 1975. In 1977, Lockheed produced two 60% scale models under the Have Blue contract. The Have Blue program was a stealth technology demonstrator that lasted from 1976 to 1979. The Northrop Grumman Tacit Blue also played a part in the development of composite material and curvilinear surfaces, low observables, fly-by-wire, and other stealth technology innovations. The success of Have Blue led the Air Force to create the &quot;Senior Trend&quot; program which developed the F-117.

In the early 21st century, the proliferation of stealth technology began outside of the United States. Both Russia and China tested their stealth aircraft in 2010. Russia manufactured 10 flyable prototypes of the Su-57, while China produced two stealth aircraft, Chengdu J-20 and Shenyang FC-31. In 2017, China became the second country in the world to field an operational stealth aircraft, challenging the United States and its Asian allies.

==Principles==
Stealth technology (or LO for &quot;low observability&quot;) is not one technology. It is a set of technologies, used in combinations, that can greatly reduce the distances at which a person or vehicle can be detected; more so radar cross-section reductions, but also acoustic, thermal, and other aspects.

==Radar cross-section (RCS) reductions==

Almost since the invention of radar, various methods have been tried to minimize detection. Rapid development of radar during World War II led to equally rapid development of numerous counter radar measures during the period; a notable example of this was the use of chaff. Modern methods include radar jamming and deception.

The term &quot;stealth&quot; in reference to reduced radar signature aircraft became popular during the late eighties when the Lockheed Martin F-117 stealth fighter became widely known. The first large scale (and public) use of the F-117 was during the Gulf War in 1991. However, F-117A stealth fighters were used for the first time in combat during Operation Just Cause, the United States invasion of Panama in 1989. Stealth aircraft are often designed to have radar cross sections that are orders of magnitude smaller than conventional aircraft. The radar range equation meant that all else being equal, detection range is proportional to the fourth root of RCS; thus, reducing detection range by a factor of 10 requires a reduction of RCS by a factor of 10,000.

===Vehicle shape===

====Aircraft====
The possibility of designing aircraft in such a manner as to reduce their radar cross-section was recognized in the late 1930s, when the first radar tracking systems were employed, and it has been known since at least the 1960s that aircraft shape makes a significant difference in detectability. The Avro Vulcan, a British bomber of the 1960s, had a remarkably small appearance on radar despite its large size, and occasionally disappeared from radar screens entirely. It is now known that it had a fortuitously stealthy shape apart from the vertical element of the tail. Despite being designed before a low radar cross-section (RCS) and other stealth factors were ever a consideration, a Royal Aircraft Establishment technical note of 1957 stated that of all the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar echoing object, due to its shape: only one or two components contributing significantly to the echo at any aspect (one of them being the vertical stabilizer, which is especially relevant for side aspect RCS), compared with three or more on most other types. While writing about radar systems, authors Simon Kingsley and Shaun Quegan singled out the Vulcan&#x27;s shape as acting to reduce the RCS. In contrast, the Tupolev 95 Russian long-range bomber (NATO reporting name &#x27;Bear&#x27;) was conspicuous on radar. It is now known that propellers and jet turbine blades produce a bright radar image; the Bear has four pairs of large diameter contra-rotating propellers.

Another important factor is internal construction. Some stealth aircraft have skin that is radar transparent or absorbing, behind which are structures termed reentrant triangles. Radar waves penetrating the skin get trapped in these structures, reflecting off the internal faces and losing energy. This method was first used on the Blackbird series: A-12, YF-12A, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.

The most efficient way to reflect radar waves back to the emitting radar is with orthogonal metal plates, forming a corner reflector consisting of either a dihedral (two plates) or a trihedral (three orthogonal plates). This configuration occurs in the tail of a conventional aircraft, where the vertical and horizontal components of the tail are set at right angles. Stealth aircraft such as the F-117 use a different arrangement, tilting the tail surfaces to reduce corner reflections formed between them. A more radical method is to omit the tail, as in the B-2 Spirit. The B-2&#x27;s clean, low-drag flying wing configuration gives it exceptional range and reduces its radar profile. The flying wing design most closely resembles a so-called infinite flat plate (as vertical control surfaces dramatically increase RCS), the perfect stealth shape, as it would have no angles to reflect back radar waves.

In addition to altering the tail, stealth design must bury the engines within the wing or fuselage, or in some cases where stealth is applied to an extant aircraft, install baffles in the air intakes, so that the compressor blades are not visible to radar. A stealthy shape must be devoid of complex bumps or protrusions of any kind, meaning that weapons, fuel tanks, and other stores must not be carried externally. Any stealthy vehicle becomes un-stealthy when a door or hatch opens.

Parallel alignment of edges or even surfaces is also often used in stealth designs. The technique involves using a small number of edge orientations in the shape of the structure. For example, on the F-22A Raptor, the leading edges of the wing and the tail planes are set at the same angle. Other smaller structures, such as the air intake bypass doors and the air refueling aperture, also use the same angles. The effect of this is to return a narrow radar signal in a very specific direction away from the radar emitter rather than returning a diffuse signal detectable at many angles. The effect is sometimes called &quot;glitter&quot; after the very brief signal seen when the reflected beam passes across a detector. It can be difficult for the radar operator to distinguish between a glitter event and a digital glitch in the processing system.

Stealth airframes sometimes display distinctive serrations on some exposed edges, such as the engine ports. The YF-23 has such serrations on the exhaust ports. This is another example in the parallel alignment of features, this time on the external airframe.

The shaping requirements detracted greatly from the F-117&#x27;s aerodynamic properties. It is inherently unstable, and cannot be flown without a fly-by-wire control system.

Similarly, coating the cockpit canopy with a thin film transparent conductor (vapor-deposited gold or indium tin oxide) helps to reduce the aircraft&#x27;s radar profile, because radar waves would normally enter the cockpit, reflect off objects (the inside of a cockpit has a complex shape, with a pilot helmet alone forming a sizeable return), and possibly return to the radar, but the conductive coating creates a controlled shape that deflects the incoming radar waves away from the radar. The coating is thin enough that it has no adverse effect on pilot vision.

====Ships====

Ships have also adopted similar methods. Though the earlier Arleigh Burke-class destroyer incorporated some signature-reduction features. the Norwegian Skjold-class corvette was the first coastal defence and the French La Fayette-class frigate the first ocean-going stealth ship to enter service. Other examples are the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën class frigates, the Taiwanese Tuo Chiang stealth corvette, German Sachsen-class frigates, the Swedish Visby-class corvette, the USS &quot;San Antonio&quot; amphibious transport dock, and most modern warship designs.

===Materials===

====Non-metallic airframe====
Dielectric composite materials are more transparent to radar, whereas electrically conductive materials such as metals and carbon fibers reflect electromagnetic energy incident on the material&#x27;s surface. Composites may also contain ferrites to optimize the dielectric and magnetic properties of a material for its application.

====Radar-absorbent material====
Radiation-absorbent material (RAM), often as paints, are used especially on the edges of metal surfaces. While the material and thickness of RAM coatings can vary, the way they work is the same: absorb radiated energy from a ground- or air-based radar station into the coating and convert it to heat rather than reflect it back. Current technologies include dielectric composites and metal fibers containing ferrite isotopes. Ceramic composite coating is a new type of material systems which can sustain at higher temperatures with better sand erosion resistance and thermal resistance. Paint comprises depositing pyramid-like colonies on the reflecting superficies with the gaps filled with ferrite-based RAM. The pyramidal structure deflects the incident radar energy in the maze of RAM. One commonly used material is called &quot;iron ball paint&quot;. It contains microscopic iron spheres that resonate in tune with incoming radio waves and dissipate most of their energy as heat, leaving little to reflect back to detectors. FSS are planar periodic structures that behave like filters to electromagnetic energy. The considered frequency-selective surfaces are composed of conducting patch elements pasted on the ferrite layer. FSS are used for filtration and microwave absorption.

===Radar stealth countermeasures and limits===

====Low-frequency radar====

Shaping offers far fewer stealth advantages against low-frequency radar. If the radar wavelength is roughly twice the size of the target, a half-wave resonance effect can still generate a significant return. However, low-frequency radar is limited by lack of available frequencies (many are heavily used by other systems), by lack of accuracy of the diffraction-limited systems given their long wavelengths, and by the radar&#x27;s size, making it difficult to transport. A long-wave radar may detect a target and roughly locate it, but not provide enough information to identify it, target it with weapons, or even to guide a fighter to it.

====Multiple emitters====

Stealth aircraft attempt to minimize all radar reflections, but are specifically designed to avoid reflecting radar waves back in the direction they came from (since in most cases a radar emitter and receiver are in the same location). They are less able to minimize radar reflections in other directions. Thus, detection can be better achieved if emitters are in different locations from receivers. One emitter separate from one receiver is termed bistatic radar; one or more emitters separate from more than one receiver is termed multistatic radar. Proposals exist to use reflections from emitters such as civilian radio transmitters, including cellular telephone radio towers.

====Moore&#x27;s law====

By Moore&#x27;s law the processing power behind radar systems is rising over time. This will eventually erode the ability of physical stealth to hide vehicles.

====Ship wakes and spray====

Synthetic aperture sidescan radars can be used to detect the location and heading of ships from their wake patterns. These are detectable from orbit. When a ship moves through a seaway it throws up a cloud of spray which can be detected by radar.

==Acoustics==

Acoustic stealth plays a primary role for submarines and ground vehicles. Submarines use extensive rubber mountings to isolate, damp, and avoid mechanical noises that can reveal locations to underwater passive sonar arrays.

Early stealth observation aircraft used slow-turning propellers to avoid being heard by enemy troops below. Stealth aircraft that stay subsonic can avoid being tracked by sonic boom. The presence of supersonic and jet-powered stealth aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird indicates that acoustic signature is not always a major driver in aircraft design, as the Blackbird relied more on its very high speed and altitude.

One method to reduce helicopter rotor noise is &quot;modulated blade spacing&quot;. Standard rotor blades are evenly spaced, and produce greater noise at a given frequency and its harmonics. Using varied spacing between the blades spreads the noise or acoustic signature of the rotor over a greater range of frequencies.

==Visibility==
The simplest technology is visual camouflage; the use of paint or other materials to color and break up the lines of a vehicle or person.

Most stealth aircraft use matte paint and dark colors, and operate only at night. Lately, interest in daylight Stealth (especially by the USAF) has emphasized the use of gray paint in disruptive schemes, and it is assumed that Yehudi lights could be used in the future to hide the airframe (against the background of the sky, including at night, aircraft of any colour appear dark) or as a sort of active camouflage. The original B-2 design had wing tanks for a contrail-inhibiting chemical, alleged by some to be chlorofluorosulfonic acid, but this was replaced in the final design with a contrail sensor that alerts the pilot when he should change altitude and mission planning also considers altitudes where the probability of their formation is minimized.

In space, mirrored surfaces can be employed to reflect views of empty space toward known or suspected observers; this approach is compatible with several radar stealth schemes. Careful control of the orientation of the satellite relative to the observers is essential, and mistakes can lead to detectability enhancement rather than the desired reduction.

==Infrared==

An exhaust plume contributes a significant infrared signature. One means to reduce IR signature is to have a non-circular tail pipe (a slit shape) to minimize the exhaust cross sectional area and maximize the mixing of hot exhaust with cool ambient air (see Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, rectangular nozzles on the Lockheed Martin F-22, and serrated nozzle flaps on the Lockheed Martin F-35). Often, cool air is deliberately injected into the exhaust flow to boost this process (see Ryan AQM-91 Firefly and Northrop B-2 Spirit). The Stefan–Boltzmann law shows how this results in less energy (Thermal radiation in infrared spectrum) being released and thus reduces the heat signature. In some aircraft, the jet exhaust is vented above the wing surface to shield it from observers below, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, and the unstealthy Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. To achieve infrared stealth, the exhaust gas is cooled to the temperatures where the brightest wavelengths it radiates are absorbed by atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor, greatly reducing the infrared visibility of the exhaust plume. Another way to reduce the exhaust temperature is to circulate coolant fluids such as fuel inside the exhaust pipe, where the fuel tanks serve as heat sinks cooled by the flow of air along the wings.

Ground combat includes the use of both active and passive infrared sensors. Thus, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) ground combat uniform requirements document specifies infrared reflective quality standards.

==Reducing radio frequency (RF) emissions==

In addition to reducing infrared and acoustic emissions, a stealth vehicle must avoid radiating any other detectable energy, such as from onboard radars, communications systems, or RF leakage from electronics enclosures. The F-117 uses passive infrared and low light level television sensor systems to aim its weapons and the F-22 Raptor has an advanced LPI radar which can illuminate enemy aircraft without triggering a radar warning receiver response.

==Measuring==
The size of a target&#x27;s image on radar is measured by the radar cross section (RCS), often represented by the symbol σ and expressed in square meters. This does not equal geometric area. A perfectly conducting sphere of projected cross sectional area 1 m2 (i.e. a diameter of 1.13 m) will have an RCS of 1 m2. Note that for radar wavelengths much less than the diameter of the sphere, RCS is independent of frequency. Conversely, a square flat plate of area 1 m2 will have an RCS of σ=4π &quot;A&quot;2 / &quot;λ&quot;2 (where &quot;A&quot;=area, &quot;λ&quot;=wavelength), or 13,982 m2 at 10 GHz if the radar is perpendicular to the flat surface. At off-normal incident angles, energy is reflected away from the receiver, reducing the RCS. Modern stealth aircraft are said to have an RCS comparable with small birds or large insects, though this varies widely depending on aircraft and radar.

If the RCS was directly related to the target&#x27;s cross-sectional area, the only way to reduce it would be to make the physical profile smaller. Rather, by reflecting much of the radiation away or by absorbing it, the target achieves a smaller radar cross section.

==Tactics==
Stealthy strike aircraft such as the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, are usually used against heavily defended enemy sites such as command and control centers or surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries. Enemy radar will cover the airspace around these sites with overlapping coverage, making undetected entry by conventional aircraft nearly impossible. Stealthy aircraft can also be detected, but only at short ranges around the radars; for a stealthy aircraft there are substantial gaps in the radar coverage. Thus a stealthy aircraft flying an appropriate route can remain undetected by radar. Even if a stealth aircraft is detected, fire-control radars operating in C, X and Ku bands cannot paint (for missile guidance) low observable (LO) jets except at very close ranges. Many ground-based radars exploit Doppler filter to improve sensitivity to objects having a radial velocity component relative to the radar. Mission planners use their knowledge of enemy radar locations and the RCS pattern of the aircraft to design a flight path that minimizes radial speed while presenting the lowest-RCS aspects of the aircraft to the threat radar. To be able to fly these &quot;safe&quot; routes, it is necessary to understand an enemy&#x27;s radar coverage (see electronic intelligence). Airborne or mobile radar systems such as airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C, AWACS) can complicate tactical strategy for stealth operation.

==Research==
After the invention of electromagnetic metasurfaces, the conventional means to reduce RCS have been improved significantly. As mentioned earlier, the main objective in purpose shaping is to redirect scattered waves away from the backscattered direction, which is usually the source. However, this usually compromises aerodynamic performance. One feasible solution, which has extensively been explored in recent time, is to use metasurfaces which can redirect scattered waves without altering the geometry of a target. Such metasurfaces can primarily be classified in two categories: (i) checkerboard metasurfaces, (ii) gradient index metasurfaces. Similarly, negative index metamaterials are artificial structures for which refractive index has a negative value for some frequency range, such as in microwave, infrared, or possibly optical. These offer another way to reduce detectability, and may provide electromagnetic near-invisibility in designed wavelengths.

Plasma stealth is a phenomenon proposed to use ionized gas, termed a plasma, to reduce RCS of vehicles. Interactions between electromagnetic radiation and ionized gas have been studied extensively for many purposes, including concealing vehicles from radar. Various methods might form a layer or cloud of plasma around a vehicle to deflect or absorb radar, from simpler electrostatic to radio frequency (RF) more complex laser discharges, but these may be difficult in practice.

Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of aircraft flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of lower RCS for stealth, via simpler geometries and lower complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer or no moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and lower mass, cost (up to 50% less), drag (up to 15% less during use), and inertia (for faster, stronger control response to change vehicle orientation to reduce detection). Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics.

In flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow. Adaptive compliant wings are a military and commercial effort. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing was a US Air Force, Boeing, and NASA effort.

In fluidics, fluid injection into airflows is being researched for use in aircraft to control direction, in two ways: circulation control and thrust vectoring. In both, larger more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller, simpler, lower mass fluidic systems, in which larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. Mechanical control surfaces that must move cause an important part of aircraft radar cross-section. Omitting mechanical control surfaces can reduce radar returns. , at least two countries are known to be researching fluidic control. In Britain, BAE Systems has tested two fluidically controlled unmanned aircraft, one starting in 2010 named Demon, and another starting in 2017 named MAGMA, with the University of Manchester. In the United States, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program named Control of Revolutionary Aircraft with Novel Effectors (CRANE) seeks &quot;... to design, build, and flight test a novel X-plane that incorporates active flow control (AFC) as a primary design consideration. ... In 2023, the aircraft received its official designation as X-65.&quot; In January 2024, construction began, at Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences. According to DARPA, the Aurora X-65 could be completed and unveiled as soon as early 2025, with the first flight occurring in summer 2025.

In circulation control, near the trailing edges of wings, aircraft flight control systems are replaced by slots which emit fluid flows.

<text>Kjelfossen () is one of the highest waterfalls in Norway. The falls are located near the village of Gudvangen in Aurland Municipality in Vestland county. With a total fall height of , the waterfall is listed as the 18th tallest waterfall in the world. The tallest single drop is . The height of the waterfall has never been accurately measured, so there are discrepancies in its actual height. Some sources list it as tall.

The waterfall is only about wide and has a flow of only . There are six drops in the falls. The largest of the three main drops (the one on the left) is officially named &quot;Kjelfossen&quot;, but is also known as &quot;Stor Kjelfossen&quot;. The middle falls is known as &quot;Vetle Kjelfoss&quot;, and the one on the right (and the smallest by volume) is thought to be unnamed. The falls are located just east of Gudvangen at the end of the Nærøyfjord. The falls can be seen from the European route E16 highway, just west of the entrance into the Gudvanga Tunnel. The falls are located about west of the village of Flåm and west of the village of Aurlandsvangen.

<text>Tyssestrengene are waterfalls east of the village of Tyssedal in Ullensvang Municipality, in Vestland county, Norway. The waterfalls are fed by the Tysso River before flowing down into the lake Ringedalsvatnet. The Trolltunga cliff is located near the waterfalls.

The total drop is , while the tallest single drop is . Following their incorporation in the Norwegian Hydroelectric Power Authority, their water flow is diminished to such a point that only after heavy snow melts is there any flow of substance.

<text>The Wollomombi Falls is a plunge waterfall on the Wollomombi River in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia.

==Location and features==
In the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park approximately due east of Armidale and off the Waterfall Way, the Wollomombi Falls are atop the Wollomombi Gorge near the confluence of the Wollomombi River with the Chandler River. The Chandler Falls are on the Chandler River, adjacent to the Wollomombi Falls. The falls descend from an elevation of above sea level (AHD) in one drop of , with a total descent that ranges in height between depending on the flow of the river.

At one time they were believed to be the tallest in Australia. However, recent geographical revisions place them at second or third tallest, depending on the source, after the Tin Mine Falls in the Snowy Mountains and the Wallaman Falls, near , Queensland.

===Hiking tracks and campground===
Several camp grounds and walking tracks are adjacent to the Wollomombi Falls and provide access to see the waterfall. Constructed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service are the Wollomombi Gorge and Falls Picnic Area, the long, three-hour return Wollomombi Walking Track, the , 90-minute return Chandler Walking Track, and the Wollomombi Campground. The Chandler Walk route passes Checks Lookout before reaching the Chandler Lookout and then winding down to the bottom of the gorge downstream from the falls. Checks Lookout is about a third of the way along this walk with a view back along the gorge to the falls. The track ends below the top of the gorge. The Wollomombi Walk goes upstream past a lookout platform and across the Wollomombi River on a long steel bridge. The track continues to another lookout platform, which looks down on the falls from the opposite side of the gorge. A further extension of the track ends at a platform with views into the Chandler River gorge, which joins the Wollomombi Gorge.

Edgars Lookout provides an accessible view of the gorge on the western side of the falls lookouts.

Facilities include drinking water, pit toilets, shelter shed, fireplace, and bush camping sites. There is also an information display.

<doc id="262590" wikidata="Q174218" url="?curid=262590" title="Vs. (Pearl Jam album)">
<text>Vs. (pronounced &quot;versus&quot;) is the second studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, released on October 19, 1993, through Epic Records. After a relentless touring schedule in support of their 1991 debut album &quot;Ten&quot;, Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. The resulting album, &quot;Vs.&quot;, featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band&#x27;s previous release. It was the band&#x27;s first collaboration with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien and its first album with drummer Dave Abbruzzese.

Pearl Jam decided to scale back its promotional efforts for &quot;Vs.&quot;, including declining to produce music videos for any of the album&#x27;s singles. Upon its release, the album sold 950,378 copies in its first five days on sale, which set the record for most copies of an album sold during its first week since SoundScan began tracking sales data in 1991, a record it held for five years. It occupied the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for five weeks, the longest duration for a Pearl Jam album. &quot;Vs.&quot; received critical acclaim and has been certified 7× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of at least seven million copies in the United States.

==Recording==
For its second album, Pearl Jam felt the pressure of trying to match the success of its debut album, &quot;Ten&quot;. In a 2002 interview, the guitarist Mike McCready said, &quot;The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy.&quot; &quot;Vs.&quot; was the first Pearl Jam album to have production duties handled by Brendan O&#x27;Brien. It was also the band&#x27;s first album with the drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who had joined the band in August 1991 and toured for the album &quot;Ten&quot;. Rehearsals for &quot;Vs.&quot; began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in Seattle. The band then moved to The Site in Nicasio, California, in March 1993 to begin recording. Abbruzzese called the tranquil recording site &quot;paradise&quot; while the singer Eddie Vedder said, &quot;I fucking hate it here ... I&#x27;ve had a hard time ... How do you make a rock record here?&quot;

The band took the approach of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O&#x27;Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O&#x27;Brien had the band members set up much as they do live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. The guitarist Stone Gossard said, &quot;I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged.&quot; Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, &quot;You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing.&quot; In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, &quot;[&quot;Vs.&quot;] was probably where it felt better recording-wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were going to be a lot of places to go with Ed.&quot;

The first week of recording produced &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Blood&quot;, &quot;Rats&quot;, and &quot;Leash&quot; before the band hit a lull. In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, as well as the sauna at the recording studio. The bassist Jeff Ament said, &quot;Recording &quot;Vs.&quot;, there was a lot more pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself ... He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place.&quot; Ament added that &quot;toward the end it got fairly intense&quot; and that the band &quot;tried to make it as uncomfortable for [Vedder] as we could.&quot; Eventually the band was able to get &quot;back on track&quot; according to Ament as Vedder was allowed &quot;to get in the space of his songs&quot;. The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, &quot;The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least ... I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn&#x27;t like that at all.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==

The album featured a much looser and rawer sound compared to the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ten&quot;. Ament said, &quot;When we made &quot;Vs.&quot;, our second record, I remember thinking, &#x27;Man, I wish our first record sounded like this.&#x27; I thought it was more direct, more powerful.&quot; Besides the heavier songs, the album features two acoustic ballads in &quot;Daughter&quot; and &quot;Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town&quot;. A few songs incorporate elements of funk, including &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Blood&quot;, and &quot;Rats&quot;. McCready stated that it was not that the band &quot;sat down and decided to be funky&quot;, but rather it came from the band &quot;exploring different directions and combining our influences&quot;. Paul Evans of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;&#x27;Animal&#x27;, &#x27;Daughter&#x27; and &#x27;Blood&#x27; ... are songs of a kind of ritual passion, tapping into something truly wild.&quot; In a 2002 interview, Gossard said, &quot;We got our heavyosity out on that record.&quot;

The songs on the album tackle personal as well as social and political concerns. Vedder said that &quot;you write what comes to you ... You try to reflect the mood of the songs.&quot; Topics on the album include child abuse (&quot;Daughter&quot;), gun culture (&quot;Glorified G&quot;), police racism (&quot;W.M.A.&quot;), and the media (&quot;Blood&quot;). &quot;Daughter&quot;, &quot;Dissident&quot;, and &quot;Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town&quot; are three storytelling songs. &quot;Daughter&quot; tells the story of a child who is abused by her parents because they do not understand her learning disability; &quot;Dissident&quot; tells the story of a woman who takes in a political fugitive; and &quot;Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town&quot; tells the story of an old lady who has been stuck in a small town her whole life.

&quot;Glorified G&quot;, a song mocking gun enthusiasts, was inspired by an incident that involved Abbruzzese telling the band he had just bought two guns, which sparked a conversation about guns within the band. &quot;W.M.A.&quot; was inspired by an incident that happened outside Pearl Jam&#x27;s rehearsal studio in which Vedder got into an altercation with a group of police officers who hassled a black friend of his but ignored him. Vedder said that &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; is about being &quot;in a car, leaving ... a bad situation&quot;. Vedder stated that &quot;Rats&quot; is about the idea that &quot;rats are probably a hell of a lot more admirable&quot; than humans. &quot;Leash&quot; was written about the same girl that the &quot;Ten&quot; song &quot;Why Go&quot; is about. Regarding &quot;Indifference&quot;, Vedder said it is about &quot;[trying to] do something to make some other peoples&#x27; lives better than they are, even if it means going through hell. Three Faces of Me.&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;Vs.&quot; was released on October 19, 1993. The album sold 950,378 copies in its first five days of release, which set a record for the most copies of an album sold in its first week of release since SoundScan began tracking sales data in 1991, surpassing the record held by &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1991, and outperformed all other entries in the &quot;Billboard&quot; top ten that week combined. &quot;Vs.&quot; held this record for five years before it was broken by Garth Brooks&#x27; 1998 album, &quot;Double Live&quot;. While &quot;Double Live&quot; officially beat &quot;Vs.&quot; in first week sales, &quot;Vs.&quot; still holds an unbreakable record in that SoundScan only counted the first five days of an album&#x27;s release in its first week sales until 1998. The album has been certified 7× platinum by the RIAA, and, as of July 2013, has sold 7,400,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer Paul Evans gave &quot;Vs.&quot; a favorable review, saying, &quot;Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with &quot;Ten&quot;; and &quot;Vs.&quot; tops even that debut.&quot; He added, &quot;Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations ... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;Pearl Jam uses its new album ... to broaden its music,&quot; and added that &quot;most of the album ... projects individual misery as public catharsis.&quot; AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey gave the album four out of five stars, saying &quot;&quot;Vs.&quot; may not reach the majestic heights of &quot;Ten&quot;, but at least half the record stands with Pearl Jam&#x27;s best work.&quot;

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B−. He said, &quot;&quot;Vs.&quot; is not a carbon copy of &quot;Ten&quot;; for that alone, [Pearl Jam] get points.&quot; However, he countered by saying that &quot;&quot;Vs.&quot; confirms once and for all that there&#x27;s nothing underground or alternative about [Pearl Jam].&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;dud&quot; rating.

Pearl Jam made a conscious decision beginning with the release of &quot;Vs.&quot; to scale back its commercial efforts. &quot;We pulled back after the second record pretty hard,&quot; Ament stated. &quot;A lot of it had to do with being in the eye of the storm and not being able to think straight.&quot; The band declined to produce music videos after the very successful &quot;Jeremy&quot;, and opted to give fewer interviews as well as make fewer television appearances. &quot;Ten years from now,&quot; Ament said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want people to remember our songs as videos.&quot;

&quot;Vs.&quot; included the hit singles &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Daughter&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot;, and &quot;Dissident&quot;, all of which placed on the Album Rock and Modern Rock charts. &quot;Daughter&quot; was the most successful song from &quot;Vs.&quot; on the rock charts, reaching the number one spot on both the Album Rock and Modern Rock charts and spending a total of eight weeks at number one on the former. Album tracks &quot;Glorified G&quot; and &quot;Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town&quot; also charted. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, &quot;Daughter&quot; received a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and &quot;Go&quot; received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. &quot;Vs.&quot; received a nomination for Best Rock Album.

In 2011, Pearl Jam released a remastered &quot;Vs.&quot;, along with &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, in three formats: an Expanded Version, a three-CD Deluxe Edition and a Limited Edition Collector&#x27;s Boxed Set. The Expanded Version features three bonus tracks recorded by Brendan O&#x27;Brien at The Site studio during the &quot;Vs.&quot; sessions: a previously unreleased acoustic version of &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Cready Stomp&quot; - a previously unreleased studio outtake, and the band&#x27;s cover of Victoria Williams&#x27; &quot;Crazy Mary&quot; featuring Williams on backing vocals and guitar, which had previously been issued on the 1993 tribute album, &quot;Sweet Relief: A Benefit for Victoria Williams&quot;. The three-CD Deluxe Edition features both the Legacy Versions of &quot;Vs.&quot; and &quot;Vitalogy&quot; with their bonus tracks and a copy of &quot;Live at the Orpheum Theater, Boston, April 12, 1994&quot;.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover art, photographed by Ament, features a black-and-white picture of an angora goat from Lifeline Farm in Victor, Montana. According to Ament, the cover was a representation of how the band felt at the time, with Ament stating &quot;we were slaves&quot;. The album booklet contains additional drawings and writings by Vedder, including one page apparently doodled at a business meeting that says &quot;I will never trust anybody again.&quot; The lyric page for &quot;W.M.A.&quot; features a portion of a news story concerning Malice Green, a victim of police brutality.

Originally, the album was titled &quot;Five Against One&quot; (The song &quot;Animal&quot; features the lyric &quot;One, two, three, four, five against one ...&quot;). Concerning the original album title, Gossard said, &quot;For me, that title represented a lot of struggles that you go through trying to make a record ... Your own independence—your own soul—versus everybody else&#x27;s.&quot; The album title was changed at the last minute, first to a self-titled album and then to &quot;Vs.&quot;, a nod to the general theme of conflict present in most of the songs on the album. Regarding the title &quot;Vs.&quot;, Vedder said, &quot;They were writing all these articles ... Our band against somebody else&#x27;s band. What the hell are they talking about? You know, don&#x27;t try to separate the powers that be. We&#x27;re all in this together.&quot;

The decision to change the album&#x27;s name at the last minute resulted in a few different versions of the album. There are also different versions of the album that are unrelated to the title. Regarding the different versions of the album, some of the first pressings of the cassette still contained &quot;Five Against One&quot; printed on the cassette itself, the first couple of pressings of the cassette do not contain the title printed on the artwork at all, and the lyrics to &quot;Indifference&quot; are included in the cassette version. The first couple of pressings of the CD do not contain the title printed on the artwork at all, and the initial versions of the CD came in an Ecopak, which was a variation on the traditional CD-sized Digipak. While not rare, they went out of print quickly and are now hard to find. The song titles are not printed on the back cover of this version, but the artwork remains the same. The vinyl version has never had the title printed on it, and the cover art on the vinyl copies is different from the CD and cassette. For all versions, the picture of the &quot;elderly woman&quot; changed at some point after the first pressings. Allegedly, the original woman never gave permission for her picture to be used, so Pearl Jam changed the picture to another woman. The difference is easy to spot, as &quot;the new and improved woman behind the counter&quot; is printed below the picture.

==Tour==

Pearl Jam promoted the album with tours in the United States in the fall of 1993 and the spring of 1994. The fall 1993 tour focused on the Western United States, while the spring 1994 tour focused on the Eastern United States. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam&#x27;s tour to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band &quot;ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans&quot;. During this tour the band set a cap on ticket prices in the attempt to thwart scalpers.

Several songs from the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, were premiered during this tour. The band&#x27;s April 3, 1994, concert in Atlanta at the Fox Theatre was broadcast live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band&#x27;s April 8, 1994, concert in Fairfax, Virginia, at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, &quot;I don&#x27;t think any of us would be in this room tonight if it weren&#x27;t for Kurt Cobain.&quot; Vedder later said that &quot;the day that we found out about Kurt ... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn&#x27;t know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though in the end it was probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I decided I would play those next two weeks and then I&#x27;d never have to play again.&quot;

Pearl Jam was outraged when it discovered after a pair of shows in Chicago in March 1994 that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Following the tour, the band brought a lawsuit against Ticketmaster that accused them of being a monopoly whose anticompetitive practices allowed markup prices of more than 30%. The band&#x27;s intention was to get ticket prices lowered for its fans. Pearl Jam&#x27;s plans for a 1994 summer tour were cancelled as a result of a Ticketmaster boycott.

On April 16, 2016, at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, Pearl Jam played the entire album in order as part of the band&#x27;s set.

==Outtakes==
Two songs recorded during the sessions but left off the album later appeared on the band&#x27;s follow-up &quot;Vitalogy&quot;: &quot;Whipping&quot; and &quot;Better Man&quot;. Both songs made their live debuts at the band&#x27;s May 13, 1993, concert in San Francisco at Slim&#x27;s Café, where the band premiered most of the newly recorded songs for &quot;Vs.&quot; &quot;Better Man&quot; was said to have been rejected because Vedder was not comfortable with the song&#x27;s accessibility. Another song recorded during the sessions is &quot;Hard to Imagine&quot;, which later appeared on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, &quot;Chicago Cab&quot;; however, that version was recorded during sessions for &quot;Vitalogy&quot;. The version recorded for &quot;Vs.&quot; appears on the 2003 rarities compilation, &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;. According to Gossard, &quot;Hard to Imagine&quot; was cut from &quot;Vs.&quot; because the band already had enough mellow songs for the album. Pearl Jam&#x27;s cover of the Victoria Williams song &quot;Crazy Mary&quot; (to which Williams herself contributed background vocals and guitar) was also recorded during these sessions. &quot;Crazy Mary&quot; appeared on the 1993 tribute album, &quot;Sweet Relief: A Benefit for Victoria Williams&quot;, and later on the 2011 &quot;Vs.&quot; reissue, as a bonus track. The Pearl Jam/Cypress Hill collaboration &quot;Real Thing&quot; was also recorded around this time. &quot;Real Thing&quot; appeared on the 1993 &quot;Judgment Night&quot; soundtrack.

<doc id="262593" wikidata="Q862" url="?curid=262593" title="Joseph Brodsky">
<text>Iosif Aleksandrovich Brodsky (; ; 24 May 1940 – 28 January 1996) was a Russian and American poet and essayist. Born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in the Soviet Union, Brodsky ran afoul of Soviet authorities and was expelled (&quot;strongly advised&quot; to emigrate) from the Soviet Union in 1972, settling in the United States with the help of W. H. Auden and other supporters. He taught thereafter at Mount Holyoke College, and at universities including Yale, Columbia, Cambridge, and Michigan. Brodsky was awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for an all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity&quot;. He was appointed United States Poet Laureate in 1991.

According to Professor Andrey Ranchin of Moscow State University, &quot;Brodsky is the only modern Russian poet whose body of work has already been awarded the honorary title of a canonized classic... Brodsky&#x27;s literary canonization is an exceptional phenomenon. No other contemporary Russian writer has been honored as the hero of such a number of memoir texts; no other has had so many conferences devoted to them.&quot; Daniel Murphy, in his seminal text &quot;Christianity and Modern European Literature&quot;, includes Brodsky among the most influential Christian poets of the 20th century, along with T. S. Eliot, Osip Mandelstam, Anna Akhmatova (Brodsky&#x27;s mentor for a time), and W. H. Auden (who sponsored Brodsky&#x27;s cause in the United States). Irene Steckler was the first to categorically state that Brodsky was &quot;unquestionably a Christian poet&quot;. Before that, in July 1972, following his exile, Brodsky himself, in an interview, said: &quot;While I am related to the Old Testament perhaps by ancestry, and certainly the spirit of justice, I consider myself a Christian. Not a good one but I try to be.&quot; The contemporary Russian poet and fellow-Acmeist, Viktor Krivulin, said that &quot;Brodsky always felt his Jewishness as a religious thing, despite the fact that, when all is said and done, he&#x27;s a Christian poet.&quot;

==Early years==

Brodsky was born into a Russian Jewish family in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). A descendant of a prominent and ancient rabbinic family, Schorr (Shor) his direct male-line ancestor was Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor. His father, Aleksandr Brodsky, was a professional photographer in the Soviet Navy, and his mother, Maria Volpert Brodskaya, a professional interpreter whose work often helped to support the family. They lived in communal apartments, in poverty, marginalized by their Jewish status. In early childhood, Brodsky survived the Siege of Leningrad where he and his parents nearly died of starvation; one aunt did die of hunger. He later developed various health problems caused by the siege. Brodsky commented that many of his teachers were anti-Jewish and that he felt like a dissident from an early age. He noted &quot;I began to despise Lenin, even when I was in the first grade, not so much because of his political philosophy or practice ... but because of his omnipresent images.&quot;

As a young student, Brodsky was &quot;an unruly child&quot; known for his misbehavior during classes. At fifteen, Brodsky left school and tried to enter the School of Submariners without success. He went on to work as a milling machine operator. Later, having decided to become a physician, he worked at the morgue at the Kresty Prison, cutting and sewing bodies. He subsequently held a variety of jobs in hospitals, in a ship&#x27;s boiler room, and on geological expeditions. At the same time, Brodsky engaged in a program of self-education. He learned Polish so he could translate the works of Polish poets such as Czesław Miłosz, and English so that he could translate John Donne. On the way, he acquired a deep interest in classical philosophy, religion, mythology, and English and American poetry.

==Career and family==

===Early career===
In 1955, Brodsky began writing his own poetry and producing literary translations. He circulated them in secret, and some were published by the underground journal, &quot;Sintaksis&quot; (Syntax, ). His writings were apolitical. By 1958 he was already well known in literary circles for his poems &quot;The Jewish cemetery near Leningrad&quot; and &quot;Pilgrims&quot;. Asked when he first felt called to poetry, he recollected, &quot;In 1959, in Yakutsk, when walking in that terrible city, I went into a bookstore. I snagged a copy of poems by Baratynsky. I had nothing to read. So I read that book and finally understood what I had to do in life. Or got very excited, at least. So in a way, Evgeny Abramovich Baratynsky is sort of responsible.&quot; His friend, Ludmila Shtern (, &quot;Ljudmíla Jákovlevna Štern&quot;), recalled working with Brodsky on an irrigation project in his &quot;geological period&quot; (working as a geologist&#x27;s assistant): &quot;We bounced around the Leningrad Province examining kilometers of canals, checking their embankments, which looked terrible. They were falling down, coming apart, had all sorts of strange things growing in them... It was during these trips, however, that I was privileged to hear the poems &quot;The Hills&quot; and &quot;You Will Gallop in the Dark&quot;. Brodsky read them aloud to me between two train cars as we were going towards Tikhvin.&quot; 
In 1960, the young Brodsky met Anna Akhmatova, one of the leading poets of the silver age. She encouraged his work, and became his mentor. In 1962, in Leningrad, Anna Akhmatova introduced him to the artist Marina Basmanova, a young painter from an established artistic family who was drawing Akhmatova&#x27;s portrait. The two started a relationship; however, Brodsky&#x27;s then close friend and fellow poet, Dmitri Bobyshev, was in love with Basmanova. As Bobyshev began to pursue the woman, immediately, the authorities began to pursue Brodsky; Bobyshev was widely held responsible for denouncing him. Brodsky dedicated much love poetry to Marina Basmanova:

===Denunciation===
In 1963, Brodsky&#x27;s poetry was denounced by a Leningrad newspaper as &quot;pornographic and anti-Soviet&quot;. His papers were confiscated, he was interrogated, twice put in a mental institution and then arrested. He was charged with social parasitism by the Soviet authorities in a trial in 1964, finding that his series of odd jobs and role as a poet were not a sufficient contribution to society. They called him &quot;a pseudo-poet in velveteen trousers&quot; who failed to fulfill his &quot;constitutional duty to work honestly for the good of the motherland&quot;. The trial judge asked, &quot;Who has recognized you as a poet? Who has enrolled you in the ranks of poets?&quot; – &quot;No one&quot;, Brodsky replied, &quot;Who enrolled me in the ranks of the human race?&quot;
For his &quot;parasitism&quot; Brodsky was sentenced to five years hard labor and served 18 months on a farm in the village of Norenskaya, in the Archangelsk region, 350 miles from Leningrad. He rented his own small cottage, and although it was without plumbing or central heating, having one&#x27;s own, private space was taken to be a great luxury at the time. Basmanova, Bobyshev, and Brodsky&#x27;s mother, among others, visited. He wrote on his typewriter, chopped wood, hauled manure, and at night read his anthologies of English and American poetry, including a lot of W. H. Auden and Robert Frost. Brodsky&#x27;s close friend and biographer Lev Loseff writes that while his confinement in the mental hospital and the trial were miserable experiences, the 18 months in the Arctic were among the best times of Brodsky&#x27;s life. Brodsky&#x27;s mentor, Anna Akhmatova, laughed at the KGB&#x27;s shortsightedness. &quot;What a biography they&#x27;re fashioning for our red-haired friend!&quot;, she said. &quot;It&#x27;s as if he&#x27;d hired them to do it on purpose.&quot;

Brodsky&#x27;s sentence was commuted in 1965 after protests by prominent Soviet and foreign cultural figures, including Evgeny Evtushenko, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Jean-Paul Sartre as well as Akhmatova. Brodsky became a cause célèbre in the West also, when a secret transcription of trial minutes was smuggled out of the country, making him a symbol of artistic resistance in a totalitarian society, much like his mentor, Akhmatova.
His son, Andrei, was born on 8 October 1967, and Basmanova broke off the relationship. Andrei was registered under Basmanova&#x27;s surname because Brodsky did not want his son to suffer from the political attacks that he endured. Marina Basmanova was threatened by the Soviet authorities, which prevented her from marrying Brodsky or joining him when he was exiled from the country. After the birth of their son, Brodsky continued to dedicate love poetry to Basmanova. In 1989, Brodsky wrote his last poem to &quot;M.B.&quot;, describing himself remembering their life in Leningrad:

Brodsky returned to Leningrad in December 1965 and continued to write over the next seven years, many of his works being translated into German, French, and English and published abroad. &quot;Verses and Poems&quot; was published by Inter-Language Literary Associates in Washington in 1965, &quot;Elegy to John Donne and Other Poems&quot; was published in London in 1967 by Longmans Green, and &quot;A Stop in the Desert&quot; was issued in 1970 by Chekhov Publishing in New York. Only four of his poems were published in Leningrad anthologies in 1966 and 1967, most of his work appearing outside the Soviet Union or circulated in secret (samizdat) until 1987. Persecuted for his poetry and his Jewish heritage, he was denied permission to travel. In 1972, while Brodsky was being considered for exile, the authorities consulted mental health expert Andrei Snezhnevsky, a key proponent of the notorious pseudo-medical diagnosis of &quot;paranoid reformist delusion&quot;. This political tool allowed the state to lock up dissenters in psychiatric institutions indefinitely. Without examining him personally, Snezhnevsky diagnosed Brodsky as having &quot;sluggishly progressing schizophrenia&quot;, concluding that he was &quot;not a valuable person at all and may be let go&quot;. In 1971, Brodsky was invited twice to emigrate to Israel. When called to the Ministry of the Interior in 1972 and asked why he had not accepted, he stated that he wished to stay in the country. Within ten days officials broke into his apartment, took his papers, and on 4 June 1972, put him on a plane for Vienna, Austria. He never returned to Russia and never saw Basmanova again. Brodsky later wrote &quot;The Last Judgement is the Last Judgement, but a human being who spent his life in Russia, has to be, without any hesitation, placed into Paradise.&quot;

In Austria, he met Carl Ray Proffer and Auden, who facilitated Brodsky&#x27;s transit to the United States and proved influential to Brodsky&#x27;s career. Proffer, of the University of Michigan and one of the co-founders of Ardis Publishers, became Brodsky&#x27;s Russian publisher from this point on. Recalling his landing in Vienna, Brodsky commented:

Although the poet was invited back after the fall of the Soviet Union, Brodsky never returned to his country.

=== United States ===

After a short stay in Vienna, Brodsky settled in Ann Arbor, with the help of poets Auden and Proffer, and became poet-in-residence at the University of Michigan for a year. Brodsky went on to become a visiting professor at Queens College (1973–74), Smith College, Columbia University, and Cambridge University, later returning to the University of Michigan (1974–80). He was the Andrew Mellon Professor of Literature and Five College Professor of Literature at Mount Holyoke College, brought there by poet and historian Peter Viereck. In 1978, Brodsky was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters at Yale University, and on 23 May 1979, he was inducted as a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He moved to New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village in 1980 and in 1981 received the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; award. He was also a recipient of The International Center in New York Award of Excellence. In 1986, his collection of essays, &quot;Less Than One&quot;, won the National Book Critics Award for Criticism and he was given an honorary doctorate of literature from Oxford University.

In 1987, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, the fifth Russian-born writer to do so. In an interview he was asked: &quot;You are an American citizen who is receiving the Prize for Russian-language poetry. Who are you, an American or a Russian?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Jewish; a Russian poet, an English essayist – and, of course, an American citizen&quot;, he responded. The academy stated that they had awarded the prize for his &quot;all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity&quot;. It also called his writing &quot;rich and intensely vital&quot;, characterized by &quot;great breadth in time and space&quot;. It was &quot;a big step for me, a small step for mankind&quot;, he joked. The prize coincided with the first legal publication in Russia of Brodsky&#x27;s poetry as an exilé.
In 1991, Brodsky became Poet Laureate of the United States. The Librarian of Congress said that Brodsky had &quot;the open-ended interest of American life that immigrants have. This is a reminder that so much of American creativity is from people not born in America.&quot; His inauguration address was printed in &quot;Poetry Review&quot;. Brodsky held an honorary degree from the University of Silesia in Poland and was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science. In 1995, Gleb Uspensky, a senior editor at the Russian publishing house, Vagrius, asked Brodsky to return to Russia for a tour, but he could not agree. For the last ten years of his life, Brodsky was under considerable pressure from those that regarded him as a &quot;fortune maker&quot;. He was a greatly honored professor, was on first name terms with the heads of many large publishing houses and connected to the significant figures of American literary life. His friend Ludmila Shtern wrote that many Russian intellectuals in both Russia and America assumed his influence was unlimited, that a nod from him could secure them a book contract, a teaching post or a grant, that it was in his gift to assure a glittering career. A helping hand or a rejection of a petition for help could create a storm in Russian literary circles, which Shtern suggests became very personal at times. His position as a lauded émigré and Nobel Prize winner won him enemies and stoked resentment, the politics of which, she writes, made him feel &quot;deathly tired&quot; of it all toward the end.
In 1990, while teaching literature in France, Brodsky married a young student, Maria Sozzani, who has a Russian-Italian background; they had one daughter, Anna Brodsky, born in 1993.

Marina Basmanova lived in fear of the Soviet authorities until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; only after this was their son Andrei Basmanov allowed to join his father in New York. In the 1990s, Brodsky invited Andrei to visit him in New York for three months and they maintained a father-son relationship until Brodsky&#x27;s death. Andrei married in the 1990s and had three children, all of whom were recognized and supported by Brodsky as his grandchildren; Marina Basmanova, Andrei, and Brodsky&#x27;s grandchildren all live in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Andrei gave readings of his father&#x27;s poetry in a documentary about Brodsky. The film contains Brodsky&#x27;s poems dedicated to Marina Basmanova and written between 1961 and 1982.

Brodsky died of a heart attack aged 55, at his apartment in Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood of Brooklyn, a borough of New York City, on 28 January 1996. He had open-heart surgery in 1979 and later two bypass operations, remaining in frail health following that time. He was buried in a non-Catholic section of the San Michele cemetery in Venice, Italy, also the resting place of Ezra Pound and Igor Stravinsky. In 1997, a plaque was placed on his former house in St. Petersburg, with his portrait in relief and the words &quot;In this house from 1940 to 1972 lived the great Russian poet, Iosif Aleksandrovich Brodsky&quot;. Brodsky&#x27;s close friend, the Nobel laureate Derek Walcott, memorialized him in his collection &quot;The Prodigal&quot;, in 2004.

==Work==
Brodsky is perhaps most known for his poetry collections, &quot;A Part of Speech&quot; (1977) and &quot;To Urania&quot; (1988), and the essay collection, &quot;Less Than One&quot; (1986), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. Other notable works include the play, &quot;Marbles&quot; (1989), and &quot;Watermark&quot; (1992), a prose meditation on Venice. Throughout his career he wrote in Russian and English, self-translating and working with eminent poet-translators.

===Themes and forms===
In his introduction to Brodsky&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (New York and Harmondsworth, 1973), W. H. Auden described Brodsky as a traditionalist lyric poet fascinated by &quot;encounters with nature, ... reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence&quot;. He drew on wide-ranging themes, from Mexican and Caribbean literature to Roman poetry, mixing &quot;the physical and the metaphysical, place and ideas about place, now and the past and the future&quot;. Critic Dinah Birch suggests that Brodsky&#x27;s &quot; first volume of poetry in English, &quot;Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems (1973)&quot;, shows that although his strength was a distinctive kind of dry, meditative soliloquy, he was immensely versatile and technically accomplished in a number of forms.&quot;

&quot;To Urania: Selected Poems 1965–1985&quot; collected translations of older work with new work written during his American exile and reflect on themes of memory, home, and loss. His two essay collections consist of critical studies of such poets as Osip Mandelshtam, W.H. Auden, Thomas Hardy, Rainer Maria Rilke and Robert Frost, sketches of his own life, and those of contemporaries such as Akhmatova, Nadezhda Mandelshtam, and Stephen Spender.

A recurring theme in Brodsky&#x27;s writing is the relationship between the poet and society. In particular, Brodsky emphasized the power of literature to affect its audience positively and to develop the language and culture in which it is situated. He suggested that the Western literary tradition was in part responsible for the world having overcome the catastrophes of the twentieth century, such as Nazism, Communism, and two World Wars. During his term as Poet Laureate, Brodsky promoted the idea of bringing the Anglo-American poetic heritage to a wider American audience by distributing free poetry anthologies to the public through a government-sponsored program. Librarian of Congress James Billington wrote:

This passion for promoting the seriousness and importance of poetry comes through in Brodsky&#x27;s opening remarks as the U.S. Poet Laureate in October 1991. He said, &quot;By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation, those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan. ... In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential. For what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom is precisely the gift of speech. ... Poetry is not a form of entertainment and in a certain sense not even a form of art, but it is our anthropological, genetic goal, our evolutionary, linguistic beacon.&quot; This sentiment is echoed throughout his work. In interview with Sven Birkerts in 1979, Brodsky reflected:

===Influences===
Librarian of Congress Dr James Billington, wrote:

Brodsky also was deeply influenced by the English metaphysical poets from John Donne to Auden. Many works were dedicated to other writers such as Tomas Venclova, Octavio Paz, Robert Lowell, Derek Walcott, and Benedetta Craveri.

Brodsky&#x27;s work is seen to have been vitally enhanced by the work of renowned translators. &quot;A Part of Speech&quot; (New York and Oxford, 1980), his second major collection in English, includes translations by Anthony Hecht, Howard Moss, Derek Walcott, and Richard Wilbur. Critic and poet Henri Cole notes that Brodsky&#x27;s &quot;own translations have been criticized for turgidness, lacking a native sense of musicality.&quot;

After the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Brodsky&#x27;s controversial poem On the Independence of Ukraine (Russian: На независимость Украины) from the early 1990s (which he did not publish but publicly recited) was repeatedly picked up by state-affiliated Russian media and declared Poem of the Year. The Estate of Joseph Brodsky was subsequently prosecuting some websites publishing the poem, demanding its removal.

<text>No Code is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, released on August 27, 1996, through Epic Records. Following a troubled tour for its previous album, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of garage rock and worldbeat.

Although &quot;No Code&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Pearl Jam&#x27;s third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band&#x27;s fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album&#x27;s inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States.

==Recording==
For its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, with whom they had worked on predecessors &quot;Vs.&quot; (1993) and &quot;Vitalogy&quot; (1994). &quot;No Code&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album with drummer Jack Irons, who had joined the band as &quot;Vitalogy&quot; was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band&#x27;s Vitalogy Tour, the band began work on &quot;No Code&quot; at the Chicago Recording Company studios in Chicago for a week in July 1995 during the infamous Chicago heat wave. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band recorded &quot;Off He Goes&quot;. The rest of the recording took place in the first half of 1996 in Seattle at Studio Litho, which is owned by guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was then mixed by O&#x27;Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta.

The sessions for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist Jeff Ament was not made aware that the band was recording until three days into the sessions, and said that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t super involved with that record on any level&quot;. Guitarist Mike McCready said, &quot;I&#x27;m sure Jeff was pissed, but it was more about separating, because if we played all together nothing would get done. We&#x27;d all just get pissed off at each other.&quot; At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder&#x27;s control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was &quot;more on-the-fly during the making of &quot;No Code&quot;, and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio.&quot;

McCready said that a lot of the songs were developed out of jam sessions, and said &quot;I think we kind of rushed it a little bit.&quot; Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals. He added that &quot;Ed&#x27;s typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of &quot;No Code&quot;, he was so burnt, it was so much work for him.&quot; The band&#x27;s mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O&#x27;Brien stated that &quot;everybody was on their best musical behavior around him.&quot; McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him &quot;a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest.&quot; Vedder said, &quot;Making &quot;No Code&quot; was all about gaining perspective.&quot; Commenting upon the sessions as a whole, O&#x27;Brien said, &quot;It was really a transitional record. We had a good time making it.&quot;

===Outtakes===
Two outtakes from the recording sessions ended up as B-sides, &quot;Black, Red, Yellow&quot; on the &quot;Hail, Hail&quot; single, and &quot;Dead Man&quot;, which was originally intended for the film &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, on &quot;Off He Goes&quot;. Both songs were included on the 2003 &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; collection of rarities, along with four other tracks from the &quot;No Code&quot; sessions, two of which ended up on compilations – &quot;Leaving Here&quot;, which appeared on &quot;Home Alive&quot;, and &quot;Gremmie Out of Control&quot;, featured on &quot;Music for Our Mother Ocean Vol. 1&quot;. The other rejected songs were &quot;All Night&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Gimme No Lip&quot;. &quot;Olympic Platinum&quot;, written by the album&#x27;s mixer Nick DiDia around the time of the 1996 Summer Olympics, was recorded by the band and released on its 1996 fan club Christmas single.

==Music and lyrics==

While &quot;Vitalogy&quot; had shifted away from the earlier albums&#x27; accessible compositions and polished production, &quot;No Code&quot; represented a deliberate break from &quot;Ten&quot;&#x27;s stadium sound, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rock songs. It stood out with its emphasis on subtle harmony (&quot;Off He Goes&quot;), Eastern influences (&quot;Who You Are&quot;), and spoken word (&quot;I&#x27;m Open&quot;). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs &quot;Who You Are&quot; and &quot;In My Tree&quot;. Irons stated, &quot;To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys have been really supportive of me doing it, and we&#x27;ve worked some things into a few songs.&quot; Vedder said, &quot;We realized that we had an opportunity to experiment.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;No Code&quot; displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.&quot;

The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination. Vedder said, &quot;I think there&#x27;s a little self-examination in those songs, something that a lot of my friends are going through too, as they approach 30.&quot; Ament said, &quot;In some ways, it&#x27;s like the band&#x27;s story. It&#x27;s about growing up.&quot; The lyrics of &quot;Hail, Hail&quot; refer to two people in a troubled relationship struggling to hold it together. Vedder has said that he wrote the song &quot;Off He Goes&quot; about himself and how he is a &quot;shit friend&quot;, adding, &quot;I&#x27;ll show up and everything&#x27;s great and then all of the sudden I&#x27;m outta there...&quot; &quot;Lukin&quot; is about the &quot;pretty intense stalker problem&quot; Vedder faced during the mid-1990s. &quot;Around the Bend&quot; was written by Vedder as a lullaby that Irons could sing to his son.

The lyrics to &quot;Smile&quot; are taken from a note that Dennis Flemion of The Frogs hid inside Vedder&#x27;s notebook while he was onstage performing. The words used in the note are taken from the Frogs songs &quot;This Is How I Feel&quot; and &quot;Now I Wanna Be Dead&quot;. Flemion is given credit in the vinyl, but the credit is absent from the CD version. The lyrics to &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; were inspired by the events surrounding Pearl Jam&#x27;s June 24, 1995, concert at San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park, which happened on the same day Vedder was hospitalized due to food poisoning. Vedder only made it through seven songs and the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of the short tour that it was on. For the first time on a Pearl Jam album, a band member other than Vedder contributed lyrics, with Gossard writing the lyrics to &quot;Mankind&quot;. Gossard also sang lead vocals on the track.

==Packaging and title==

The album package consists of 156 Polaroid photos that unfold into a 2×2 square. The Polaroid photos are seemingly random. One of the photos featured on the front cover is the eyeball of Dennis Rodman, former Chicago Bulls player and friend of the band, while another photo is of Vedder&#x27;s foot after he had been stung by a stingray. The pictures, when viewed from afar, blend to form the &quot;No Code&quot; triangle/eyeball logo that is the theme throughout the album. Later pressings of the CD featured a 1x4 format packaging, losing the hidden message effect. The CD and vinyl came with lyrics printed on the back of replica Polaroids. Only nine Polaroids came in a set, (with a catalog number Suffix of &#x27;C&#x27; &#x27;O&#x27; &#x27;D&#x27; or &#x27;E&#x27;)leaving one to have to obtain another set to accumulate all thirteen songs.

When discussing the album&#x27;s title, Vedder said &quot;it&#x27;s called &quot;No Code&quot; because it&#x27;s full of code. It&#x27;s misinformation.&quot; In medical terminology, a &quot;no code&quot; order is a medical order to withhold CPR on a patient. It is also known as a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order. In another interview, Vedder said that &quot;if the record is a complete failure you&#x27;ve kind of owned up to it in a subliminal way. &quot;No Code&quot; was the same thing. For me, &quot;No Code&quot; meant &#x27;Do Not Resuscitate&#x27;.&quot;

==Tour==

Pearl Jam promoted the album with tours in North America and Europe in the fall of 1996. The short tour of North America focused on the East Coast of the United States. As with &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, very little touring was done in the United States to promote &quot;No Code&quot; because of the band&#x27;s refusal to play in Ticketmaster&#x27;s venues. The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows. A European tour followed in the fall of 1996, of which the band&#x27;s November 3, 1996, show in Berlin, Germany at Deutschlandhalle was broadcast on many radio stations worldwide.

During the North American tour fans complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be remote and impersonal. Gossard stated that there was &quot;a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time&quot; and that &quot;it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.&quot; He added, &quot;Ticketmaster, as monopolistic as it may be, is very efficient so we weren&#x27;t playing the venues we wanted to play.&quot;

On October 17, 2014, at the iWireless Center in Moline, Illinois, during the Lightning Bolt Tour, Pearl Jam played the entire album in order as part of their set.

==Release and reception==

===Commercial performance===
&quot;No Code&quot; sold 366,500 copies in its first week of release, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but falling short of analysts&#x27; predictions of at least 535,000 copies. This was significantly less than what the band&#x27;s previous two albums sold in their respective first weeks of release. It was, however, the seventh biggest-selling debut of what was a slow year for the industry. It stayed at number one for two weeks, and was Pearl Jam&#x27;s last album to debut at number one on the album chart until &quot;Backspacer&quot; was released in 2009. By its sixth week, the album had sold 790,000 copies. &quot;No Code&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA, but was the band&#x27;s first album to not reach multi-platinum status. As of 2013, the album has sold 1.7 million copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Three singles were released from &quot;No Code&quot;. The lead single &quot;Who You Are&quot; peaked at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and reached number one on the Modern Rock charts and number five on the Mainstream Rock charts. Neither of the album&#x27;s other singles, &quot;Hail, Hail&quot; and &quot;Off He Goes&quot;, charted on the Hot 100, but both placed on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts, as did album track &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;.

&quot;Present Tense&quot; reached No. 1 on iTunes&#x27; Top 40 US Rock Songs chart on May 18, 2020, after being featured in the ending of the ESPN documentary series &quot;The Last Dance&quot;.

===Critical response===
Upon its release, &quot;No Code&quot; received a mixed to positive critical reception. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer David Fricke gave &quot;No Code&quot; four out of five stars, saying that the album &quot;is abrupt in its mood swings almost to the point of vertigo.&quot; He praised the album as &quot;the kind of impulsive, quixotic, provocative ruckus that has become rare in a modern-rock mainstream&quot; and added that &quot;&quot;No Code&quot; basically means no rule books, no limits and, above all, no fear.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; gave the album four out of five stars. The review said that the album &quot;constantly adds unexpected and fascinating details...A solid attraction amid intriguing oddities is the powerful array of guitar sounds.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau described the album as &quot;slowly winning a heartwarming battle against constitutional melancholia.&quot; AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three and a half out of five stars, saying, &quot;While a bit too incoherent, &quot;No Code&quot; is Pearl Jam&#x27;s richest and most rewarding album to date as well as their most human.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; gave &quot;No Code&quot; a seven out of ten. In the review, it is stated that &quot;Vedder is still preoccupied with his own mortality, but now he appears more quasi-mystical than miserable...for all its relative placidity, &quot;No Code&quot; is still a difficult beast.&quot;

Referring to the songs on the album, Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;about half are worth the effort.&quot; He observed that &quot;too often, [Vedder] falls into American culture&#x27;s Disney syndrome, idealizing childhood innocence above all.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a C, saying that while &quot;No Code&quot; &quot;cracks open their sound&quot;, it &quot;becomes a collection of fragments that don&#x27;t add up to much of anything, except a portrait of a musically disjointed band.&quot; On the change in mood compared with the band&#x27;s previous releases, he said that &quot;the album leaves you with the vaguely unsettling feeling that Pearl Jam without pain are like a pretzel without salt, or Seattle without rain.&quot; Ryan Schreiber of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that &quot;there&#x27;s a ton of filler here. In fact, it&#x27;s almost &quot;all&quot; filler.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; reviewer Christopher John Farley said that the album &quot;makes it sound as if they&#x27;re having a midlife crisis.&quot; Farley added that &quot;too few of the songs on the Pearl Jam CD explore the musical possibilities they suggest in any kind of definitive or provocative manner.&quot;

<doc id="262597" wikidata="Q339078" url="?curid=262597" title="Yield (album)">
<text>Yield is the fifth studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, released on February 3, 1998. Following a short promotional tour for its previous album, &quot;No Code&quot; (1996), Pearl Jam recorded &quot;Yield&quot; throughout 1997 at Studio Litho and Studio X in Seattle, Washington. The album was hailed as a return to the band&#x27;s early, straightforward rock sound, and marked a more collaborative effort from the band as opposed to relying heavily on frontman Eddie Vedder to compose the song lyrics from the past four studio albums.

&quot;Yield&quot; received positive reviews and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. While like &quot;No Code&quot;, the album soon began dropping down the charts, &quot;Yield&quot; eventually outsold its predecessor. The band did more promotion for the album compared to &quot;No Code&quot;, including a return to full-scale touring and the release of a music video for the song &quot;Do the Evolution&quot;. The record has been certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States. The album is Pearl Jam&#x27;s last release with drummer Jack Irons, who left the band during the album&#x27;s promotional tour. He was replaced with Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron.

==Recording==
For its fifth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, whom the band had worked with on its previous three records. &quot;Yield&quot; was recorded throughout 1997 in Seattle, Washington at Studio X and Studio Litho, the latter of which is owned by guitarist Stone Gossard. They weren&#x27;t able to record it entirely at Studio Litho since it was booked by Deftones, who recorded their album &quot;Around the Fur&quot; at the studio between April and June of 1997. The album was then mixed by O&#x27;Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album would be the last collaboration with O&#x27;Brien for several years, until he was brought on board in 2008 to remix the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Ten&quot; and produce 2009&#x27;s &quot;Backspacer.&quot;

Compared with &quot;Vitalogy&quot; and &quot;No Code&quot;, &quot;Yield&quot; represented more of a team effort among all members of the group. Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder had made the final decisions for &quot;Vitalogy&quot; and &quot;No Code&quot;; however, at the end of the &quot;No Code&quot; recording sessions, Vedder suggested to bassist Jeff Ament that it would be better for the other members to write and bring in more complete songs so Vedder would be under less pressure to finish the songs. Ament said that &quot;everybody took that to heart,&quot; and O&#x27;Brien added that most of the songs came to the studio finished. Ament also said that Vedder&#x27;s reaction to the rest of the band&#x27;s new material kept &quot;everybody energized about their place in the band.&quot; Vedder worked with the other band members on their own material before work was started on his. Guitarist Mike McCready noticed a change in Vedder&#x27;s attitude during the recording of &quot;Yield&quot;, stating, &quot;I used to be afraid of him and not want to confront him on things ... We talk more now, and hang out ... He seems very, very centered now.&quot;

Vedder said that the band was able to &quot;team up&quot; and have a &quot;partnership&quot; while the album was being recorded. The band spent a large amount of time rehearsing the songs to get the best takes possible. Gossard commented that there was more &quot;contouring&quot; and &quot;honing&quot; of demo material than on previous records. Regarding the recording sessions, drummer Jack Irons said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t put any time limit on it. It was like, &#x27;When this record&#x27;s done, we call it a record.&#x27; We took out time to come up with ideal sounds and feel for every song, so that each had its own identity. We would cut a track and go back and listen to it and openly discuss it.&quot; Ament stated that &quot;&quot;Yield&quot; was a superfun record to make. And so much of it was Ed kind of sitting back.&quot; He added that &quot;everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they&#x27;re an integral part of the band.&quot; The band discussed the album&#x27;s production on the documentary &quot;Single Video Theory&quot;.

In a June 1997 interview, Vedder said the band had &quot;just about finished&quot; recording the album. However, Gossard would spend the next period of time focusing on his side project Brad, who had just released their second Epic Records album &quot;Interiors&quot; late that same month. No work on &quot;Yield&quot; occurred during July 1997, with the band commencing recording in August. In October 1997, it was confirmed that the album was completed, with a rumored Christmas release date.

==Music and lyrics==

Overall, &quot;Yield&quot; resembles the straightforward rock approach of the band&#x27;s early work. Gossard said &quot;The songs were a little bit more structured. I don&#x27;t know if it was poppier, but it seemed more professional.&quot; O&#x27;Brien noted that during the &quot;Yield&quot; sessions, the band made a conscious effort to create more accessible songs. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that the band has &quot;turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they&#x27;ve come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, &quot;Ten&quot;.&quot; &quot;Given to Fly&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, was noted for its similarity to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Going to California&quot; from the 1971 album, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;.

Lyrically, &quot;Yield&quot; continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on &quot;No Code&quot;. Vedder said that while &quot;in the past we got really angry and we cried out against many things in our songs,&quot; he considered that when &quot;you become an adult you have to express your energy in a different way, more calm.&quot; This led to songs that, while not eschewing &quot;the bad side of life&quot;, ended up &quot;facing it from a more positive point of view, looking for a way to solve it. In the past we said: what a shit, this stinks, that sucks, everything sucks... Now it&#x27;s time to say: stop, let&#x27;s look for a solution, let&#x27;s be positive.&quot; Several songs on the album were inspired by literary works, including Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (&quot;Pilate&quot;), Daniel Quinn&#x27;s novel &quot;Ishmael&quot; (&quot;Do the Evolution&quot;), and the writings of Charles Bukowski (&quot;In Hiding&quot;). Gossard wrote the lyrics for the songs &quot;No Way&quot; and &quot;All Those Yesterdays&quot;, and Ament, making his first lyrical contributions to a Pearl Jam album, wrote the lyrics for &quot;Pilate&quot; and &quot;Low Light&quot;. Ament said, &quot;[to] watch Eddie put his heart into singing lyrics that I wrote was an experience I can&#x27;t put into words.&quot;

Gossard said &quot;No Way&quot; expresses the idea that people just need to live &quot;and quit trying to prove something&quot;. According to Vedder, &quot;Given to Fly&quot; is about &quot;rising above anybody&#x27;s comments about what you do and still giving your love away&quot;, &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; is about &quot;someone who&#x27;s drunk with technology, who thinks they&#x27;re the controlling living being on this planet&quot;, &quot;MFC&quot; takes place in a car and is about &quot;getting the fuck out of a problem&quot;, and &quot;In Hiding&quot; is about &quot;taking a fast from life&quot;. Ament said that &quot;Pilate&quot; concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old sitting with his dog on the porch, while &quot;Low Light&quot; was the answer, and that it deals with &quot;a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of the person I could choose to be.&quot;

==Packaging and title==
The album&#x27;s cover art shows an empty road underneath a bright blue sky with a yield sign on the right-hand side of the road. The front cover art image was taken from a photograph of Montana Highway 200 between Lincoln and Great Falls, Montana, while the inside cover depicts the yield sign in the middle of the ocean. The cover of the cassette version mirrored the image. A yield sign is hidden in every picture of the liner notes booklet. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, &quot;Yield&quot; received a nomination for Best Recording Package. Ament said that the cover came from the idea on &quot;how cool to have a yield sign where there&#x27;s nothing to yield to&quot;, and the place was a road on the way to his Montana home which he considered perfect for the photo.

The album title is rooted in the idea of &quot;yielding to nature&quot;, a theme central to Daniel Quinn&#x27;s novel &quot;Ishmael&quot;. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, &quot;I think the title &quot;Yield&quot; has to do with maybe being more comfortable within ourselves, with this band...we&#x27;re all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That&#x27;s what it kind of feels to me – yielding, letting something else happen and going with it.&quot; Vedder said, &quot;Let&#x27;s say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, and then you have to think, &#x27;What are the real battles?&#x27; &#x27;What&#x27;s really important?&#x27; You get to a certain point, and it&#x27;s really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you.&quot;

The indie rock band BOAT parodied the album&#x27;s cover art, among several others, on its 2011 release &quot;Dress Like Your Idols&quot;.

==Release and reception==

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Yield&quot; was released on February 3, 1998, on CD, vinyl, cassette and MiniDisc. Epic promoted the album more than &quot;No Code&quot;, with marketing vice-president Steve Barnett claiming it was the first time since debut album &quot;Ten&quot; that the label &quot;had the lead time to do the job right&quot;. The album leaked on the internet in December 1997 as Syracuse, New York radio station WKRL-FM played an advance copy of the record, leading fans who taped the broadcast to release the tracks online. Two singles were released from &quot;Yield&quot;. The lead single &quot;Given to Fly&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 21, reached number three on the Modern Rock charts, and spent a total of six weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album&#x27;s other commercially released single, &quot;Wishlist&quot;, charted on the Hot 100 at number 47. Album tracks &quot;In Hiding&quot; and &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; also charted on the rock charts. The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for &quot;Do the Evolution&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first music video since 1992. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance and its music video received a nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form.

&quot;Yield&quot; sold 358,000 copies during its first week of release, and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. It was held off the top spot by the &quot;Titanic&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Yield&quot; became Pearl Jam&#x27;s first album not to peak at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts since &quot;Ten&quot; in 1991. However, &quot;Yield&quot; has been certified platinum by the RIAA, and eventually outsold its predecessor &quot;No Code&quot; with 1.9 million copies in the United States as of 2008 according to Nielsen SoundScan.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Yield&quot; received generally favourable reviews from music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer Rob Sheffield wrote that while &quot;before, the band&#x27;s best songs were the change-of-pace ballads&quot;, &quot;Yield&quot; &quot;marks the first time Pearl Jam have managed to sustain that mood for a whole album.&quot; He added that &quot;Vedder is singing more frankly than ever about his life as an adult,&quot; and that the album &quot;shows that Pearl Jam have made the most out of growing up in public.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot;″s RJ Smith said that Pearl Jam had &quot;come back with an album full of gracefully ambivalent anthems. All commodities should be this unstable, and have this much blood pumping through them.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Robert Christgau said, &quot;Like nobody less than Nirvana... they voice the arena-rock agon more vulnerably and articulately than any Englishman standing. Rarely if ever has a Jesus complex seemed so modest.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the band &quot;applies its introspection to spiritual possibilities and its guitars to chomping, snarling, exuberant riffs.&quot; He said &quot;the songs sound bolder and more confident, even when they invoke private crises.&quot; Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that &quot;the overall tone is less pretentious than in the past, reflecting a looser, even marginally whimsical, worldview.&quot; Holly Bailey of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it &quot;the most lyrically powerful album Pearl Jam have ever produced&quot;, and stated that &quot;&quot;Yield&quot; proves that Pearl Jam, and even rock music, is still alive and kicking.&quot; Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; found that the album reasserts Pearl Jam as &quot;the only grunge force to outlive that genre, expand musical boundaries and still embody the original spirit of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s Simon Williams praised its musical diversity, remarking that the band &quot;stomp across their bluesy roots, careering through various styles and pop-mongous strops.&quot;

However, AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine was more critical, finding that the division of &quot;Yield&quot; &quot;into rock and ballad sides&quot; only &quot;emphasizes the relative lack of exceptional material&quot;. Writing for &quot;Select&quot; in March 1998, Eddy Lawrence concluded that &quot;Yield&quot; is an abandonment of the &quot;anthemic qualities&quot; present in Pearl Jam&#x27;s previous work, claiming, in relation to the band&#x27;s grunge roots, that the album &quot;makes you realise how &#x27;60s fans felt watching the first generation of rock heroes die&quot;. He went on to state that &quot;&quot;Yield&quot;&#x27;s retroisms represent no leap forward for the band as a whole, and the oft-times mildly diverting tunes are, ironically, less challenging than their strong-willed early output.&quot;

==Tour==
Pearl Jam promoted the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both were met with financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam&#x27;s sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, &quot;We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn&#x27;t in a position to carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don&#x27;t know if he thought they&#x27;d put things on hold for him.&quot; He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, &quot;I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said &#x27;hey what are you doing this summer?&#x27;&quot; Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that &quot;The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn&#x27;t a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they&#x27;ve been through so many different drummers, I don&#x27;t even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band.&quot;

Pearl Jam&#x27;s summer tour of North America marked the band&#x27;s return to full-scale touring and the use of Ticketmaster, to which the band had previously protested. Pearl Jam once again began using it in order to &quot;better accommodate concertgoers&quot;. The band still kept Ticketmaster venues at a minimum, stadiums in particular as manager Kelly Curtis joked that unlike U2, &quot;the band doesn&#x27;t have a lemon&quot;. The first leg of the tour focused on the West Coast of the United States and the Midwest, and then the band moved to the East Coast for the tour&#x27;s second leg. and after it was completed the band released its first live album, &quot;Live on Two Legs&quot;, which featured select performances from the tour. McCready stated that the band released the live album due to the strength of Pearl Jam&#x27;s shows on the tour.

On October 20, 2014, at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee, during the Lightning Bolt Tour, Pearl Jam played the entire album in order as part of their set.

;Notes
===Outtakes===
The album&#x27;s singles featured two B-sides from the &quot;Yield&quot; recording sessions that were not included on the album: &quot;Leatherman&quot;, about the eponymous 19th century vagabond was a B-side on the &quot;Given to Fly&quot; single, and &quot;U&quot; was featured on the &quot;Wishlist&quot; single, being later re-recorded for the 2003 &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; collection of rarities. &quot;Whale Song&quot;, sung by Irons, was also recorded during the &quot;Yield&quot; sessions and was eventually included on the 1999 &quot;Music for Our Mother Ocean, Vol. 3&quot; compilation as well as &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;. &quot;Happy When I&#x27;m Crying&quot; was recorded around this time and was released on the band&#x27;s 1997 fan club Christmas single.

<text>Elizabeth City County was a county in southeastern Virginia from 1634 until 1952 when it was merged into the city of Hampton. Originally created in 1634 as Elizabeth River Shire, it was one of eight shires created in the Virginia Colony by order of the King Charles I. In 1636, it was subdivided, and the portion north of the harbor of Hampton Roads became known as Elizabeth City Shire. It was renamed Elizabeth City County a short time later.

Elizabeth City was originally named Kikotan (also spelled Kecoughtan and Kikowtan), presumably a word for the Native Americans living there when the English arrived in 1607. They were friendly to the English, but Sir Thomas Gates either worried about safety (including potential attack by the Spaniards and the Dutch) or coveted their corn fields after the &quot;starving time&quot; of the 1609–10 winter. The English seized their land while the men were out hunting, and for some reason, the natives never attacked the settlement in response.

The shire and county were named for Elizabeth of Bohemia, daughter of King James I, sister of Princes Henry and Charles.

The town of Hampton, established in 1680, became the largest city in Elizabeth City County, and was the county seat. Hampton became an independent city in 1908, though it remained the seat of Elizabeth City County and continued to share many services with the county. In 1952, Elizabeth City County and the only incorporated town in the county, Phoebus, merged with and into Hampton. This merger was the first in a series of municipal consolidations in Hampton Roads that resulted in most of the area being split into independent cities. With few exceptions, modern-day Hampton encompasses nearly all of what was Elizabeth City County.

The main exceptions are portions of Elizabeth City County that are now part of Newport News. At the time of the Peninsula Extension of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway, part of the western portion of the county became part of Warwick County. This enabled the entire southern end of the extension to be in Warwick County. The City of Newport News was formed out of this portion of Warwick County, and in January 1927 the Elizabeth City County town of Kecoughtan was also annexed into the City of Newport News.

Since English settlers occupied the former Indian village of Kecoughtan in 1610, and the town at Jamestown was abandoned in 1699, the city of Hampton now claims to be the oldest continuously settled English-speaking city in North America.

<doc id="262601" wikidata="Q9645" url="?curid=262601" title="Thorax">
<text>The thorax (: thoraces or thoraxes) or chest is a part of the anatomy of mammals and other tetrapod animals located between the neck and the abdomen.

In insects, crustaceans, and the extinct trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions of the body, each in turn composed of multiple segments.

The human thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain.

==Etymology==
The word thorax comes from the Greek θώραξ &quot;thṓrax&quot; &quot;breastplate, cuirass, corslet&quot; via .

==Humans==
===Structure===
In humans and other hominids, the thorax is the chest region of the body between the neck and the abdomen, along with its internal organs and other contents. It is mostly protected and supported by the rib cage, spine, and shoulder girdle.

====Contents====
The contents of the thorax include the heart and lungs (and the thymus gland); the major and minor pectoral muscles, trapezius muscles, and neck muscle; and internal structures such as the diaphragm, the esophagus, the trachea, and a part of the sternum known as the xiphoid process. Arteries and veins are also contained – (aorta, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and the pulmonary artery); bones (the shoulder socket containing the upper part of the humerus, the scapula, sternum, thoracic portion of the spine, collarbone, and the rib cage and floating ribs).

External structures are the skin and nipples.

====Chest====
In the human body, the region of the thorax between the neck and diaphragm in the front of the body is called the chest. The corresponding area in an animal can also be referred to as the chest.

The shape of the chest does not correspond to that part of the thoracic skeleton that encloses the heart and lungs. All the breadth of the shoulders is due to the shoulder girdle, and contains the axillae and the heads of the humeri. In the middle line the suprasternal notch is seen above, while about three fingers&#x27; breadth below it a transverse ridge can be felt, which is known as the sternal angle and this marks the junction between the manubrium and body of the sternum. Level with this line the second ribs join the sternum, and when these are found the lower ribs can often be counted. At the lower part of the sternum, where the seventh or last true ribs join it, the ensiform cartilage begins, and above this there is often a depression known as the pit of the stomach.

====Bones====
The bones of the thorax, called the &quot;thoracic skeleton&quot; is a component of the axial skeleton.

It consists of the ribs and sternum. The ribs of the thorax are numbered in ascending order from 1–12. 11 and 12 are known as floating ribs because they have no anterior attachment point in particular the cartilage attached to the sternum, as 1 through 7 are, and therefore are termed &quot;floating&quot;. Whereas ribs 8 through 10 are termed false ribs as their costal cartilage articulates with the costal cartilage of the rib above. The thorax bones also have the main function of protecting the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels in the thorax area, such as the aorta.

====Landmarks====
The anatomy of the chest can also be described through the use of anatomical landmarks. The nipple in the male is situated in front of the fourth rib or a little below; vertically it lies a little external to a line drawn down from the middle of the clavicle; in the female it is not so constant. A little below it the lower limit of the great pectoral muscle is seen running upward and outward to the axilla; in the female this is obscured by the breast, which extends from the second to the sixth rib vertically and from the edge of the sternum to the mid-axillary line laterally. The female nipple is surrounded for half an inch by a more or less pigmented disc, the areola. The apex of a normal heart is in the fifth left intercostal space, three and a half inches from the mid-line.

===Clinical significance===
Different types of diseases or conditions that affect the chest include pleurisy, flail chest, atelectasis, and the most common condition, chest pain. These conditions can be hereditary or caused by birth defects or trauma. Any condition that lowers the ability to either breathe deeply or to cough is considered a chest disease or condition.

====Injury====
Injury to the chest (also referred to as chest trauma, thoracic injury, or thoracic trauma) results in up to of all deaths due to trauma in the United States.

The major pathophysiologies encountered in blunt chest trauma involve derangements in the flow of air, blood, or both in combination. Sepsis due to leakage of alimentary tract contents, as in esophageal perforations, also must be considered. Blunt trauma commonly results in chest wall injuries (e.g., rib fractures). The pain associated with these injuries can make breathing difficult, and this may compromise ventilation. Direct lung injuries, such as pulmonary contusions (see the image below), are frequently associated with major chest trauma and may impair ventilation by a similar mechanism.

====Pain====
Chest pain can be the result of multiple issues, including respiratory problems, digestive issues, and musculoskeletal complications. The pain can trigger cardiac issues as well. Not all pain that is felt is associated with the heart, but it should not be taken lightly either. Symptoms can be different depending on the cause of the pain. While cardiac issues cause feelings of sudden pressure in the chest or a crushing pain in the back, neck, and arms, pain that is felt due to noncardiac issues gives a burning feeling along the digestive tract or pain when deep breaths are attempted. Different people feel pains differently for the same condition. Only a patient truly knows if the symptoms are mild or serious.

Chest pain may be a symptom of myocardial infarctions (&#x27;heart attack&#x27;). If this condition is present in the body, discomfort will be felt in the chest that is similar to a heavy weight placed on the body. Sweating, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and irregular heartbeat may also be experienced. If a heart attack occurs, the bulk of the damage is caused during the first six hours, so getting the proper treatment as quickly as possible is important. Some people, especially those who are elderly or have diabetes, may not have typical chest pain but may have many of the other symptoms of a heart attack. It is important that these patients and their caregivers have a good understanding of heart attack symptoms.

=====Non-cardiac causes=====
Just like with a heart attack, not all chest pain is caused by conditions involving the heart. Chest wall pain can be experienced after an increase in activity. Persons who add exercise to their daily routine generally feel this type of pain at the beginning. It is important to monitor the pain to ensure that it is not a sign of something more serious. Pain can also be experienced in persons who have an upper respiratory infection. This virus is also accompanied by a fever and cough. Shingles is another viral infection that can give symptoms of chest or rib pain before a rash develops. Injuries to the rib cage or sternum is also a common cause of chest pain. It is generally felt when deep breaths are taken or during a cough.

====Atelectasis====
Another non-cardiac cause of chest pain is atelectasis. It is a condition that occurs when a portion of the lung collapses from being airless. When bronchial tubes are blocked, this condition develops and causes patients to feel shortness of breath. The most common cause of atelectasis is when a bronchi that extends from the windpipe is blocked and traps air. The blockage may be caused by something inside the bronchus, such as a plug of mucus, a tumour, or an inhaled foreign object such as a coin, piece of food, or a toy. It is possible for something outside of the bronchus to cause the blockage.

====Pneumothorax====
Pneumothorax is the condition where air or gas can build up in the pleural space. It can occur without a known cause or as the result of a lung disease or acute lung injury. The size of the pneumothorax changes as air or gas builds up, so a medical procedure can release the pressure with a needle. If it is untreated, blood flow can be interrupted and cause a drop in blood pressure known as tension pneumothorax. It is possible for smaller cases to clear up on their own. Symptoms of this condition are often felt only on one side of the lung or as a shortness of breath.

==Tetrapods==
In mammals, the thorax is the region of the body formed by the sternum, the thoracic vertebrae, and the ribs. It extends from the neck to the diaphragm, and does not include the upper limbs. The heart and the lungs reside in the thoracic cavity, as well as many blood vessels. The inner organs are protected by the rib cage and the sternum. Thoracic vertebrae are also distinguished in birds, but not in reptiles.

==Arthropods==
In insects, crustaceans, and the extinct trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions of the creature&#x27;s body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments. It is the area where the wings and legs attach in insects, or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites. In most insects, the thorax itself is composed of three segments; the prothorax, the mesothorax, and the metathorax. In extant insects, the prothorax never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the metathorax, though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments. In the apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal segment is fused to the metathorax, where it forms a structure known as the propodeum. Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the mesosoma to distinguish it from the &quot;thorax&quot; of other insects.

Each thoracic segment in an insect is further subdivided into various parts, the most significant of which are the dorsal portion (the notum), the lateral portion (the pleuron; one on each side), and the ventral portion (the sternum). In some insects, each of these parts is composed of one to several independent exoskeletal plates with membrane between them (called sclerites), though in many cases the sclerites are fused to various degrees.

<text>Live on Two Legs is the first major live album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, released on November 24, 1998, through Epic Records. The album has been certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States.

==Overview==
&quot;Live on Two Legs&quot; consists of live performances of songs from different shows of the band&#x27;s summer 1998 North American tour. Guitarist Mike McCready stated that the band released the live album due to the strength of Pearl Jam&#x27;s shows on the tour. It debuted at number fifteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. &quot;Live on Two Legs&quot; has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

&quot;Daughter&quot; features vocalist Eddie Vedder singing lyrics to Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; (as the band continues a quiet jam to &quot;Daughter&quot;) along with lyrics to Pearl Jam&#x27;s own &quot;W.M.A.&quot; towards the end of the song. The album also contains Pearl Jam&#x27;s rendition of Young&#x27;s song &quot;Fuckin&#x27; Up&quot;.

AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars. He said that &quot;Pearl Jam still sounds good, but they lack the wild energy that distinguished their early years. Professionalism has its good points, however, and it&#x27;s true that &quot;Live on Two Legs&quot; is eminently listenable, thanks in no small part to a fine track selection...&quot;Live on Two Legs&quot; is a souvenir, a thank you to fans who have stood by throughout the years, and on those terms, it&#x27;s successful.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer David Browne gave the album an A−. He said, &quot;Despite the band&#x27;s continuing self-importance and fuzzy-around-the-edges arrangements, this set of uptight anthems (&quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;) packs a post-grunge wallop.&quot;

<text>In theoretical physics, negative mass is a hypothetical type of exotic matter whose mass is of opposite sign to the mass of normal matter, e.g. −1 kg. Such matter would violate one or more energy conditions and exhibit strange properties such as the oppositely oriented acceleration for an applied force orientation. It is used in certain hypothetical technologies such as time travel to the past and future, construction of traversable artificial wormholes, which may also allow for time travel, Krasnikov tubes, the Alcubierre drive, and potentially other types of faster-than-light warp drives. Currently, the closest known real representative of such exotic matter is a region of negative pressure density produced by the Casimir effect.

==In cosmology==
In December 2018, astrophysicist Jamie Farnes from the University of Oxford proposed a &quot;dark fluid&quot; theory, related, in part, to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses, presented earlier by Albert Einstein, that may help better understand, in a testable manner, the considerable amounts of unknown dark matter and dark energy in the cosmos.

==In general relativity==
Negative mass is any region of space in which for some observers the mass density is measured to be negative. This may occur due to a region of space in which the sum of the three normal stress components (pressure on each of three axes) of the Einstein stress–energy tensor is larger in magnitude than the mass density. All of these are violations of one or another variant of the positive energy condition of Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity; however, the positive energy condition is not a required condition for the mathematical consistency of the theory.

===Inertial versus gravitational mass===
In considering negative mass, it is important to consider which of these concepts of mass are negative. Ever since Newton first formulated his theory of gravity, there have been at least three conceptually distinct quantities called mass:
* inertial mass – the mass &quot;m&quot; that appears in Newton&#x27;s second law of motion, F = &quot;m&quot; a
* &quot;active&quot; gravitational mass – the mass that produces a gravitational field that other masses respond to 
* &quot;passive&quot; gravitational mass – the mass that responds to an external gravitational field by accelerating.
The law of conservation of momentum requires that active and passive gravitational mass be identical. Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass, and all experimental evidence to date has found these are, indeed, always the same.

In most analyses of negative mass, it is assumed that the equivalence principle and conservation of momentum continue to apply without using any matter in the process, and therefore all three forms of mass are still the same, leading to the study of &quot;negative mass&quot;. But the equivalence principle is simply an observational fact, and is not necessarily valid. If such a distinction is made, a &quot;negative mass&quot; can be of three kinds: whether the inertial mass is negative, the gravitational mass, or both.

In his 4th-prize essay for the 1951 Gravity Research Foundation competition, Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger considered the possibility of negative mass and how it would behave under gravitational and other forces.

In 1957, following Luttinger&#x27;s idea, Hermann Bondi suggested in a paper in &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot; that mass might be negative as well as positive. He pointed out that this does not entail a logical contradiction, as long as all three forms of mass are negative, but that the assumption of negative mass involves some counter-intuitive form of motion. For example, an object with negative inertial mass would be expected to accelerate in the opposite direction to that in which it was pushed (non-gravitationally).

There have been several other analyses of negative mass, such as the studies conducted by R. M. Price, though none addressed the question of what kind of energy and momentum would be necessary to describe non-singular negative mass. Indeed, the Schwarzschild solution for negative mass parameter has a naked singularity at a fixed spatial position. The question that immediately comes up is, would it not be possible to smooth out the singularity with some kind of negative mass density. The answer is yes, but not with energy and momentum that satisfies the dominant energy condition. This is because if the energy and momentum satisfies the dominant energy condition within a spacetime that is asymptotically flat, which would be the case of smoothing out the singular negative mass Schwarzschild solution, then it must satisfy the positive energy theorem, i.e. its ADM mass must be positive, which is of course not the case. However, it was noticed by Belletête and Paranjape that since the positive energy theorem does not apply to asymptotic de Sitter spacetime, it would actually be possible to smooth out, with energy–momentum that does satisfy the dominant energy condition, the singularity of the corresponding exact solution of negative mass Schwarzschild–de Sitter, which is the singular, exact solution of Einstein&#x27;s equations with cosmological constant. In a subsequent article, Mbarek and Paranjape showed that it is in fact possible to obtain the required deformation through the introduction of the energy–momentum of a perfect fluid.

===Runaway motion===
Although no particles are known to have negative mass, physicists (primarily Hermann Bondi in 1957, William B. Bonnor in 1964 and 1989, then Robert L. Forward) have been able to describe some of the anticipated properties such particles may have. Assuming that all three concepts of mass are equivalent according to the equivalence principle, the gravitational interactions between masses of arbitrary sign can be explored, based on the Newtonian approximation of the Einstein field equations. The interaction laws are then:

* Positive mass attracts both other positive masses and negative masses.
* Negative mass repels both other negative masses and positive masses.

For two positive masses, nothing changes and there is a gravitational pull on each other causing an attraction. Two negative masses would repel because of their negative inertial masses. For different signs however, there is a push that repels the positive mass from the negative mass, and a pull that attracts the negative mass towards the positive one at the same time.

Hence Bondi pointed out that two objects of equal and opposite mass would produce a constant acceleration of the system towards the positive-mass object, an effect called &quot;runaway motion&quot; by Bonnor who disregarded its physical existence, stating: 
Such a couple of objects would accelerate without limit (except a relativistic one); however, the total mass, momentum and energy of the system would remain zero. This behavior is completely inconsistent with a common-sense approach and the expected behavior of &quot;normal&quot; matter. Thomas Gold even hinted that the runaway linear motion could be used in a perpetual motion machine if converted to circular motion:
But Forward showed that the phenomenon is mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation laws. If the masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, then the momentum of the system remains zero if they both travel together and accelerate together, no matter what their speed:

:formula_1

And equivalently for the kinetic energy:

:formula_2

However, this is perhaps not exactly valid if the energy in the gravitational field is taken into account.

Forward extended Bondi&#x27;s analysis to additional cases, and showed that even if the two masses and are not the same, the conservation laws remain unbroken. This is true even when relativistic effects are considered, so long as inertial mass, not rest mass, is equal to gravitational mass.

This behaviour can produce bizarre results: for instance, a gas containing a mixture of positive and negative matter particles will have the positive matter portion increase in temperature without bound. However, the negative matter portion gains negative temperature at the same rate, again balancing out. Geoffrey A. Landis pointed out other implications of Forward&#x27;s analysis, including noting that although negative mass particles would repel each other gravitationally, the electrostatic force would be attractive for like charges and repulsive for opposite charges.

Forward used the properties of negative-mass matter to create the concept of diametric drive, a design for spacecraft propulsion using negative mass that requires no energy input and no reaction mass to achieve arbitrarily high acceleration.

Forward also coined a term, &quot;nullification&quot;, to describe what happens when ordinary matter and negative matter meet: they are expected to be able to cancel out or nullify each other&#x27;s existence. An interaction between equal quantities of positive mass matter (hence of positive energy ) and negative mass matter (of negative energy ) would release no energy, but because the only configuration of such particles that has zero momentum (both particles moving with the same velocity in the same direction) does not produce a collision, such interactions would leave a surplus of momentum.

==Arrow of time and energy inversion==

In general relativity, the universe is described as a Riemannian manifold associated to a metric tensor solution of Einstein&#x27;s field equations. In such a framework, the runaway motion forbids the existence of negative matter.

Some bimetric theories of the universe propose that two parallel universes with an opposite arrow of time may exist instead of one, linked together by the Big Bang and interacting only through gravitation. The universe is then described as a manifold associated to two Riemannian metrics (one with positive mass matter and the other with negative mass matter). According to group theory, the matter of the conjugated metric would appear to the matter of the other metric as having opposite mass and arrow of time (though its proper time would remain positive). The coupled metrics have their own geodesics and are solutions of two coupled field equations.

The negative matter of the coupled metric, interacting with the matter of the other metric via gravity, could be an alternative candidate for the explanation of dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation and an accelerating universe.

==Gravitational interaction of antimatter==
The gravitational interaction of antimatter with matter has been observed by physicists. As was the consensus among physicists previously, it was experimentally confirmed that gravity attracts both matter and antimatter at the same rate within experimental error.

Bubble chamber experiments provide further evidence that antiparticles have the same inertial mass as their normal counterparts. In these experiments, the chamber is subjected to a constant magnetic field that causes charged particles to travel in helical paths, the radius and direction of which correspond to the ratio of electric charge to inertial mass. Particle–antiparticle pairs are seen to travel in helices with opposite directions but identical radii, implying that the ratios differ only in sign; but this does not indicate whether it is the charge or the inertial mass that is inverted. However, particle–antiparticle pairs are observed to electrically attract one another. This behavior implies that both have positive inertial mass and opposite charges; if the reverse were true, then the particle with positive inertial mass would be repelled from its antiparticle partner.

==In quantum mechanics==
In 1928, Paul Dirac&#x27;s theory of elementary particles, now part of the Standard Model, already included negative solutions. The Standard Model is a generalization of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and negative mass is already built into the theory.

Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever pointed out that the quantum mechanics of the Casimir effect can be used to produce a locally energy-negative region of space–time. In this article, and subsequent work by others, they showed that negative matter could be used to stabilize a wormhole. Cramer &quot;et al.&quot; argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by negative-mass loops of cosmic string. Stephen Hawking has argued that negative energy is a necessary condition for the creation of a closed timelike curve by manipulation of gravitational fields within a finite region of space; this implies, for example, that a finite Tipler cylinder cannot be used as a time machine.

===Schrödinger equation===
For energy eigenstates of the Schrödinger equation, the wavefunction is wavelike wherever the particle&#x27;s energy is greater than the local potential, and exponential-like (evanescent) wherever it is less. Naively, this would imply kinetic energy is negative in evanescent regions (to cancel the local potential). However, kinetic energy is an operator in quantum mechanics, and its expectation value is always positive, summing with the expectation value of the potential energy to yield the energy eigenvalue.

For wavefunctions of particles with zero rest mass (such as photons), this means that any evanescent portions of the wavefunction would be associated with a local negative mass–energy. However, the Schrödinger equation does not apply to massless particles; instead the Klein–Gordon equation is required.

== In theory of vibrations and metamaterials ==

The mechanical model giving rise to the negative effective mass effect is depicted in Figure 1. A core with mass formula_3 is connected internally through the spring with constant formula_4 to a shell with mass formula_5. The system is subjected to the external sinusoidal force formula_6. If we solve the equations of motion for the masses formula_5 and formula_3 and replace the entire system with a single effective mass formula_9 we obtain:
formula_10
where formula_11.

When the frequency formula_12 approaches formula_13 from above the effective mass formula_9 will be negative.

The negative effective mass (density) becomes also possible based on the electro-mechanical coupling exploiting plasma oscillations of a free electron gas (see Figure 2). The negative mass appears as a result of vibration of a metallic particle with a frequency of formula_12 which is close the frequency of the plasma oscillations of the electron gas formula_3 relatively to the ionic lattice formula_5. The plasma oscillations are represented with the elastic spring formula_18, where formula_19 is the plasma frequency. Thus, the metallic particle vibrated with the external frequency &quot;ω&quot; is described by the effective mass

:formula_20,

which is negative when the frequency &quot;ω&quot; approaches formula_19 from above. Metamaterials exploiting the effect of the negative mass in the vicinity of the plasma frequency were reported.

<text>The jacamars are a family, Galbulidae, of birds from tropical South and Central America, extending up to Mexico. The family contains five genera and 18 species. The family is closely related to the puffbirds, another Neotropical family, and the two families are often separated into their own order, Galbuliformes, separate from the Piciformes. They are principally birds of low-altitude woodlands and forests, and particularly of forest edge and canopy.

==Taxonomy==

The placement of the combined puffbird and jacamar lineage was in question, with some bone and muscle features suggesting they may be more closely related to the Coraciiformes. However, analysis of nuclear DNA in a 2003 study placed them as sister group to the rest of the Piciformes, also showing that the groups had developed zygodactyl feet before separating. Per Ericson and colleagues, in analysing genomic DNA, confirmed that puffbirds and jacamars were sister groups and their place in Piciformes.

The phylogenetic relationship between the jacamars and the eight other families in the order Piciformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
==Description==
The jacamars are small to medium-sized perching birds, in length and weighing . They are elegant, glossy birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behaviour they resemble the Old World bee-eaters, as most aerial insectivores tend to have short, wide bills rather than long, thin ones. The legs are short and weak, and the feet are zygodactylic (two forward-pointing toes, two backward-pointing). Their plumage is often bright and highly iridescent, although it is quite dull in a few species. There are minor differences in plumage based on sex, males often having a white patch on the breast.

==Behaviour==

===Diet and feeding===
Jacamars are insectivores, taking a variety of insect prey (many specialize on butterflies and moths) by hawking in the air. Birds sit in favoured perches and sally towards the prey when it is close enough. Only the great jacamar varies from the rest of the family, taking prey by gleaning and occasionally taking small lizards and spiders.

===Breeding===
The breeding systems of jacamars have not been studied in depth. They are thought to generally be monogamous, although a few species are thought to engage in cooperative breeding sometimes, with several adults sharing duties. The family nests in holes either in the soil or in arboreal termite mounds. Ground-nesting species usually nest in the banks of rivers (or, more recently, roads), although if these are not available they will nest in the soil held by the roots of fallen trees. Bank-nesting jacamars can sometimes be loosely colonial. Clutch sizes are between one and four eggs, and usually more than one. Both parents participate in incubation. Little is known about the incubation times of most species, but it lasts between 19 and 26 days in the rufous-tailed jacamar. Chicks are born with down feathers, unique among the piciformes.

<text>Nixon in China is an opera in three acts by John Adams with a libretto by Alice Goodman. Adams&#x27;s first opera, it was inspired by U.S. president Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman&#x27;s libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon&#x27;s visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.

To create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon&#x27;s youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.

Following the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded at least five times. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion has tended to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera.

== Background ==
=== Historical background ===
During his rise to power, Richard Nixon became known as a leading anti-communist. After he became president in 1969, Nixon saw advantages in improving relations with China and the Soviet Union; he hoped that détente would put pressure on the North Vietnamese to end the Vietnam War, and he might be able to manipulate the two main communist powers to the benefit of the United States.

Nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China even before he became president, writing in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; a year before his election: &quot;There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation.&quot; Assisting him in this venture was his National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, with whom the President worked closely, bypassing Cabinet officials. With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during Nixon&#x27;s first year in office—Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations. A breakthrough came in early 1971, when Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players. Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials.

The announcement that Nixon would visit China in 1972 made world headlines. Almost immediately, the Soviet Union also invited Nixon for a visit, and improved US-Soviet relations led to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). Nixon&#x27;s visit to China was followed closely by many Americans, and the scenes of him there were widely aired on television. Chinese premier Zhou Enlai stated that the handshake he and Nixon had shared on the airport tarmac at the beginning of the visit was &quot;over the vastest distance in the world, 25 years of no communication&quot;. Nixon&#x27;s change, from virulent anti-communist to the American leader who took the first step in improving relations with a great communist power, led to a new political adage, &quot;Only Nixon could go to China.&quot;

=== Inception ===

In 1983, theater and opera director Peter Sellars proposed to American composer John Adams that he write an opera about Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China. Sellars was intrigued by Nixon&#x27;s decision to make the visit, seeing it as both &quot;a ridiculously cynical election ploy ... and a historical breakthrough&quot;. Adams, who had not previously attempted an opera, was initially skeptical, assuming that Sellars was proposing a satire. Sellars persisted, however, and Adams, who had interested himself in the origin of myths, came to believe the opera could show how mythic origins may be found in contemporary history. Both men agreed that the opera would be heroic in nature, rather than poking fun at Nixon or Mao. Sellars invited Alice Goodman to join the project as librettist, and the three met at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. in 1985 to begin intensive study of the six characters, three American and three Chinese, upon whom the opera would focus. The trio endeavored to go beyond the stereotypes about figures such as Nixon and Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao and to examine their personalities.

As Adams worked on the opera, he came to see Nixon, whom he had once intensely disliked, as an &quot;interesting character&quot;, a complicated individual who sometimes showed emotion in public. Adams wanted Mao to be &quot;the Mao of the huge posters and Great Leap Forward; I cast him as a heldentenor&quot;. Mao&#x27;s wife, on the other hand, was to be &quot;not just a shrieking coloratura, but also someone who in the opera&#x27;s final act can reveal her private fantasies, her erotic desires, and even a certain tragic awareness. Nixon himself is a sort of Simon Boccanegra, a self-doubting, lyrical, at times self-pitying melancholy baritone.&quot;

Goodman explained her characterizations:

A writer tends to find her characters in her self, so I can tell you ... that Nixon, Pat, Mme. Mao, Kissinger and the chorus were all &#x27;me.&#x27; And the inner lives of Mao and Chou En-Lai, who I couldn&#x27;t find in myself at all, were drawn from a couple of close acquaintances.

Sellars, who was engaged at the time in staging the three Mozart-Da Ponte operas, became interested in the ensembles in those works; this interest is reflected in &quot;Nixon in China&quot;&#x27;s final act. The director encouraged Adams and Goodman to make other allusions to classical operatic forms; thus the expectant chorus that begins the work, the heroic aria for Nixon following his entrance, and the dueling toasts in the final scene of Act 1. In rehearsal, Sellars revised the staging for the final scene, changing it from a banquet hall in the aftermath of a slightly alcohol-fueled dinner to the characters&#x27; bedrooms.

The work required sacrifices: Goodman later noted that choruses which she loved were dropped for the improvement of the opera as a whole. The work provoked bitter arguments among the three. Nevertheless, musicologist Timothy Johnson, in his 2011 book about &quot;Nixon in China&quot;, noted &quot;the result of the collaboration betrays none of these disagreements among its creators who successfully blended their differing points of view into a very satisfyingly cohesive whole&quot;.

== Roles ==

== Synopsis ==
: Time: February 1972.
: Place: In and around Peking.

=== Act 1 ===

At Peking Airport, contingents of the Chinese military await the arrival of the American presidential aircraft &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;, carrying Nixon and his party. The military chorus sings the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. After the aircraft touches down, Nixon emerges with Pat Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The president exchanges stilted greetings with the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai, who heads the welcoming party. Nixon speaks of the historical significance of the visit, and of his hopes and fears for the encounter (&quot;News has a kind of mystery&quot;). The scene changes to Chairman Mao&#x27;s study, where the chairman awaits the arrival of the presidential party. Nixon and Kissinger enter with Chou, and Mao and the president converse in banalities as photographers record the scene. In the discussion that follows, the westerners are confused by Mao&#x27;s gnomic and frequently impenetrable comments, which are amplified by his secretaries and often by Chou. The scene changes again, to the evening&#x27;s banquet in the Great Hall of the People. Chou toasts the American visitors (&quot;We have begun to celebrate the different ways&quot;) and Nixon responds (&quot;I have attended many feasts&quot;), after which the toasts continue as the atmosphere becomes increasingly convivial. Nixon, a politician who rose to prominence on anti-communism, announces: &quot;Everyone, listen; just let me say one thing. I opposed China, I was wrong&quot;.

=== Act 2 ===

Pat Nixon is touring the city, with guides. Factory workers present her with a small model elephant which, she delightedly informs them, is the symbol of the Republican Party which her husband leads. She visits a commune where she is greeted enthusiastically, and is captivated by the children&#x27;s games that she observes in the school. &quot;I used to be a teacher many years ago&quot;, she sings, &quot;and now I&#x27;m here to learn from you&quot;. She moves on to the Summer Palace, where in a contemplative aria (&quot;This is prophetic&quot;) she envisages a peaceful future for the world. In the evening the presidential party, as guests of Mao&#x27;s wife Chiang Ch&#x27;ing, attends the Peking Opera for a performance of a political ballet-opera &quot;The Red Detachment of Women&quot;. This depicts the downfall of a cruel and unscrupulous landlord&#x27;s agent (played by an actor who strongly resembles Kissinger) at the hands of brave women revolutionary workers. The action deeply affects the Nixons; at one point Pat rushes onstage to help a peasant girl she thinks is being whipped to death. As the stage action ends, Chiang Ch&#x27;ing, angry at the apparent misinterpretation of the piece&#x27;s message, sings a harsh aria (&quot;I am the wife of Mao Tse-tung&quot;), praising the Cultural Revolution and glorifying her own part in it. A revolutionary chorus echoes her words.

=== Act 3 ===
On the last evening of the visit, as they lie in their respective beds, the chief protagonists muse on their personal histories in a surreal series of interwoven dialogues. Nixon and Pat recall the struggles of their youth; Nixon evokes wartime memories (&quot;Sitting round the radio&quot;). Mao and Chiang Ch&#x27;ing dance together, as the Chairman remembers &quot;the tasty little starlet&quot; who came to his headquarters in the early days of the revolution. As they reminisce, Chiang Ch&#x27;ing asserts that &quot;the revolution must not end&quot;. Chou meditates alone; the opera finishes on a thoughtful note with his aria &quot;I am old and I cannot sleep&quot;, asking: &quot;How much of what we did was good?&quot; The early morning birdcalls are summoning him to resume his work, while &quot;outside this room the chill of grace lies heavy on the morning grass&quot;.

== Performance history ==

The work was a joint commission from the Houston Grand Opera, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Netherlands Opera and the Washington Opera, all of which planned to mount early productions of the opera. Fearful that the work might be challenged as defamatory or not in the public domain, Houston Grand Opera obtained insurance to cover such an eventuality. Before its stage premiere, the opera was presented in concert form in May 1987 in San Francisco, with intermission discussions led by Adams. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review, a number of audience members left as the work proceeded.

&quot;Nixon in China&quot; formally premiered on the Brown Stage at the new Wortham Theater Center in Houston on October 22, 1987, with John DeMain conducting the Houston Grand Opera. Former president Nixon was invited, and was sent a copy of the libretto; however, his staff indicated that he was unable to attend, due to illness and an impending publication deadline. A Nixon representative later stated that the former president disliked seeing himself on television or other media, and had little interest in opera. According to Adams, he was later told by former Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment that Nixon was highly interested in everything written about him, and so likely saw the Houston production when it was televised on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot;.

The piece opened in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Music Critics Association, guaranteeing what the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; described as a &quot;very discriminating audience&quot;. Members of the association also attended meetings with the opera&#x27;s production team. When Carolann Page, originating Pat Nixon, waved to the audience in character as First Lady, many waved back at her. Adams responded to complaints that the words were difficult to understand (no supertitles were provided) by indicating that it is not necessary that all the words be understood on first seeing an opera. The audience&#x27;s general reaction was expressed by what the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; termed &quot;polite applause&quot;, the descent of the &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; being the occasion for clapping from both the onstage chorus and from the viewers in the opera house.

When the opera reached the Brooklyn Academy of Music, six weeks after the world premiere, there was again applause during the &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;″s descent. Chou En-lai&#x27;s toast, addressed by baritone Sanford Sylvan directly to the audience, brought what pianist and writer William R. Braun called &quot;a shocked hush of chastened admiration&quot;. The meditative Act 3 also brought silence, followed at its conclusion by a storm of applause. On March 26, 1988, the work opened at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, where Nixon&#x27;s emergence from the plane was again met with applause.

After the opera&#x27;s European premiere at the Muziektheater in Amsterdam in June 1988, it received its first German performance later that year at the Bielefeld Opera, in a production by John Dew with stage designs by Gottfried Pilz. In the German production, Nixon and Mao were given putty noses in what the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; considered &quot;a garish and heavy-handed satire&quot;. Also in 1988 the opera received its United Kingdom premiere, at the Edinburgh International Festival in August.

For the Los Angeles production in 1990, Sellars made revisions to darken the opera in the wake of the Tiananmen Square protests. The original production had not had an intermission between Acts 2 and 3; one was inserted, and Sellars authorized supertitles, which he had forbidden in Houston. Adams conducted the original cast in the French premiere, at the Maison de la Culture de Bobigny, Paris, on December 14, 1991. Thereafter, performances of the opera became relatively rare; writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in April 1996, Alex Ross speculated on why the work had, at that time, &quot;dropped from sight&quot;.

The London premiere of the opera took place in 2000, at the London Coliseum, with Sellars producing and Paul Daniel conducting the English National Opera (ENO). A revival of this production was planned for the reopening of the renovated Coliseum in 2004, but delays in the refurbishment caused the revival to be postponed until 2006. The ENO productions helped to revive interest in the work, and served as the basis of the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s 2011 production. Peter Gelb, the Met&#x27;s general manager, had approached Adams in 2005 about staging his operas there. Gelb intended that &quot;Nixon in China&quot; be the first of such productions, but Adams chose &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot; to be the first Adams work to reach the Met. However, Gelb maintained his interest in staging &quot;Nixon in China&quot;, which received its Metropolitan premiere on February 2, 2011. The work received its BBC Proms debut at the Royal Albert Hall in London on September 5, 2012, although the second-act ballet was omitted.

While a number of productions have used variations on the original staging, the February 2011 production by the Canadian Opera Company used an abstract setting revived from a 2004 production by the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis. Alluding to Nixon&#x27;s &quot;News&quot; aria, the omnipresence of television news was dramatized by set designer Allen Moyer by keeping a group of televisions onstage throughout much of the action, often showing scenes from the actual visit. Instead of an airplane descending in Act 1, a number of televisions descended showing an airplane in flight.

Adams conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Los Angeles Master Chorale for performances of the opera at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2017 during a series of concerts celebrating his 70th birthday. This &quot;musically and visually dazzling reimagining of the piece&quot; included Super 8mm home movies of the visit to China (shot by H. R. Haldeman, Dwight Chapin, and others) projected onto a giant screen with the appearance of a 1960s television set. In some scenes the historical footage was a backdrop that was artfully synchronized to the live cast in the foreground, in other scenes the actors were lit from behind the translucent screen appearing inside the TV, adding to the surreal experience. The props and other details were simple but effective, including the miniature souvenir program designed after Mao&#x27;s Little Red Book.

Despite a recent proliferation of performances worldwide, the opera has not been shown in China .

Houston Grand Opera is again producing the opera in 2017 on the 30th anniversary of the world premiere to mixed reviews.

A new production was premiered at Staatsoper Stuttgart in April 2019.

== Reception ==
The original production in Houston received mixed reviews. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic John von Rhein called &quot;Nixon in China&quot; &quot;an operatic triumph of grave and thought-provoking beauty&quot;. &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reviewer Ann Holmes said of the work, &quot;The music of &quot;Nixon&quot; catches in your ear; I find myself singing it while whizzing along the freeways.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; critic Mark Swed wrote that it would &quot;bear relevance for as long as mankind cherished humanity&quot;. Martin Bernheimer, writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, drew attention to the choreography of Morris (&quot;the trendy enfant terrible of modern dance&quot;) in the Act 2 ballet sequences. Morris had produced &quot;one of those classical yet militaristic Sino-Soviet ballets from the revolutionary repertory of Mme. Mao&quot;. Bernheimer also praised &quot;the subtle civility of Alice Goodman&#x27;s couplet-dominated libretto&quot;.

In a more critical vein, &quot;The New York Times&quot; chief music critic Donal Henahan alluded to the publicity buildup for the opera by opening his column, headed &quot;That was it?&quot;, by calling the work &quot;fluff&quot; and &quot;a Peter Sellars variety show, worth a few giggles but hardly a strong candidate for the standard repertory&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; magazine Peter G. Davis said that &quot;Goodman&#x27;s libretto, written in elegant couplets, reads better than it sings&quot; and &quot;the main trouble... is Adams&#x27;s music... this is the composer&#x27;s first opera and it shows, mainly in the clumsy prosody, turgid instrumentation that often obscures the words, ineffective vocal lines, and inability to seize the moment and make the stage come to life.&quot; &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; critic James Wierzbicki called the opera &quot;more interesting than good ... a novelty, not much more.&quot; Television critic Marvin Kitman, just prior to the telecast of the original Houston production in April 1988, stated &quot;There are only three things wrong with &quot;Nixon in China&quot;. One, the libretto; two, the music; three, the direction. Outside of that, it&#x27;s perfect.&quot;

The critic Theodore Bale, in his review of a revival of the opera in Houston in 2017, said he continues &quot;to enjoy being perplexed by its deep structure and quirky contemporary aesthetic. Adam&#x27;s music is constantly shimmering with some new idea, Alice Goodman&#x27;s libretto is constantly surprising and eloquent, and each of the three acts offers myriad opportunities for interpretation and commentary. The opera is filled with gorgeous ensemble passages and the chorus as an entity is at the heart of the work. I have, I suppose, &quot;used&quot; Nixon in China for three decades as one of the finest examples of late 20th-century American opera.&quot;

The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought critical praise: &quot;Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical beauty and sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open.&quot; When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after a long period of theatrical neglect, &quot;Tempo&quot;&#x27;s critic Robert Stein responded to ENO&#x27;s 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that &quot;Adams&#x27;s triumph ... consists really in taking a plot chock-full of talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation ... making a satisfying and engaging piece.&quot; Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;from its early visual coup with the arrival of the plane, Sellars&#x27; production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form&quot;. In Jeal&#x27;s view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that &quot;Nixon in China is a great American Opera. I suspected that it was a significant work when I saw it in 1987; I was ever more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today I am certain that it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive.&quot;

At the Met premiere in February 2011, although the audience—which included Nixon&#x27;s daughter Tricia Nixon Cox—gave the work a warm reception, critical approval of the production was not uniform. Robert Hofler of &quot;Variety&quot; criticized Sellars for using body microphones to amplify the singing, thus compensating for the &quot;vocally distressed&quot; Maddalena. He further complained that the director, known for designing unorthodox settings for the operas he has staged (Hofler mentions &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in the New York Trump Tower and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in an urban slum), here uses visually uninteresting, overly realistic sets for the first two acts. Hofler felt that it was time that the opera received a fresh approach: &quot;Having finally arrived at the Met, &quot;Nixon in China&quot; has traveled the world. It is a masterpiece, a staple of the opera repertory, and now it simply deserves a new look&quot;. However, Anthony Tommasini of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, while noting that Maddalena&#x27;s voice was not as strong as it had been at the world premiere, maintained that due to his long association with the role, it would have been impossible to bring the opera to the Met with anyone else as Nixon: &quot;Maddalena inhabits the character like no other singer&quot;. Tommasini also praised the performance of Robert Brubaker in the role of Mao, &quot;captur[ing] the chairman&#x27;s authoritarian defiance and rapacious self-indulgence&quot;, and found the Scottish soprano Janis Kelly &quot;wonderful&quot; as Pat Nixon.

Swed recalled the opera&#x27;s reception in 1987 while reviewing the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s 2011 production:

An opera that was belittled in 1987 by major New York critics – as a CNN Opera of no lasting merit when Houston Grand Opera premiered it – has clearly remained relevant. Reaching the Met for the first time, it is now hailed as a classic.

== Music ==
&quot;Nixon in China&quot; contains elements of minimalism. This musical style originated in the United States in the 1960s and is characterized by stasis and repetition in place of the melodic development associated with conventional music. Although Adams is associated with minimalism, the composer&#x27;s biographer, Sarah Cahill, asserts that of the composers classed as minimalists, Adams is &quot;by far the most anchored in Western classical tradition&quot;.

Timothy Johnson contends that &quot;Nixon in China&quot; goes beyond minimalism in important ways. Adams had been inspired, in developing his art, by minimalist composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley, and this is reflected in the work by repetitive rhythmic patterns. However, the opera&#x27;s complex harmonic structures are very different from the simpler ones in, for example, Glass&#x27;s &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, which Adams terms &quot;mindlessly repetitive&quot;; Johnson nevertheless considers the Glass opera an influence on &quot;Nixon in China&quot;. As Glass&#x27;s techniques did not allow Adams to accomplish what he wanted, he employed a system of constantly shifting metric organizational schemes to supplement the repeated rhythms in the opera. The music is marked by metrical dissonance, which occurs both for musical reasons and in response to the text of the opera.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Allan Kozinn writes that with &quot;Nixon in China&quot;, Adams had produced a score that is both &quot;minimalist and eclectic ... In the orchestral interludes one hears references, both passing and lingering, to everything from Wagner to Gershwin and Philip Glass.&quot; In reviewing the first recording of the work, &quot;Gramophone&#x27;s&quot; critic discusses the mixture of styles and concludes that &quot;minimalist the score emphatically is not&quot;. Other commentators have evoked &quot;neo-classical Stravinsky&quot;, and concocted the term &quot;Mahler-meets-minimalism&quot;, in attempts to pinpoint the opera&#x27;s idiom.

The opera is scored for an orchestra without bassoons, French horns, and tuba, but augmented by saxophones, pianos, and electronic synthesizer. The percussion section incorporates numerous special effects, including a wood block, sandpaper blocks, slapsticks and sleigh bells. The work opens with an orchestral prelude of repetitive ascending phrases, after which a chorus of the Chinese military sings solemn couplets against a subdued instrumental background. This, writes Tommasini, creates &quot;a hypnotic, quietly intense backdrop, pierced by fractured, brassy chords like some cosmic chorale&quot;, in a manner reminiscent of Philip Glass. Tommasini contrasts this with the arrival of Nixon and his entourage, when the orchestra erupts with &quot;big band bursts, rockish riffs and shards of fanfares: a heavy din of momentous pomp&quot;. &quot;Gramophone&quot;&#x27;s critic compares the sharply written exchanges between Nixon, Mao and Chou En-lai with the seemingly aimless wandering of the melodic lines in the more reflective sections of the work, concluding that the music best serves the libretto in passages of rapid dialogue. Tommasini observes that Nixon&#x27;s own vocal lines reflect the real-life president&#x27;s personal awkwardness and social unease.

The differences in perspective between East and West are set forth early in the first act, and underscored musically: while the Chinese of the chorus see the countryside as fields ready for harvest, the fruits of their labor and full of potential, the Nixons describe what they saw from the windows of the &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; as a barren landscape. This gap is reflected in the music: the chorus for the workers is marked by what Johnson terms &quot;a wide-ranging palette of harmonic colors&quot;, the Western perspective is shown by the &quot;quick, descending, dismissive cadential gesture&quot; which follows Nixon&#x27;s description of his travels.

The second act opens with warm and reflective music culminating in Pat Nixon&#x27;s tender aria &quot;This is prophetic&quot;. The main focus of the act, however, is the Chinese revolutionary opera-ballet, &quot;The Red Detachment of Women&quot;, &quot;a riot of clashing styles&quot; according to Tommasini, reminiscent of agitprop theatre with added elements of Strauss waltzes, blasts of jazz and 1930s Stravinsky. The internal opera is followed by a monologue, &quot;I am the wife of Mao Tse-tung&quot; in which Chiang Ch&#x27;ing, Mao&#x27;s wife, rails against counterrevolutionary elements in full coloratura soprano mode that culminates in a high D, appropriate for a character who in real life was a former actress given to self-dramatization. Critic Thomas May notes that, in the third act, her &quot;pose as a power-hungry Queen of the Night gives way to wistful regret&quot;. In this final, &quot;surreal&quot; act the concluding thoughts of Chou En-lai are described by Tommasini as &quot;deeply affecting&quot;. The act incorporates a brief foxtrot episode, choreographed by Morris, illustrating Pat Nixon&#x27;s memories of her youth in the 1930s.

Critic Robert Stein identifies Adams&#x27;s particular strengths in his orchestral writing as &quot;motoring, brassy figures and sweetly reflective string and woodwind harmonies&quot;, a view echoed by Gregory Carpenter in the liner notes to the 2009 Naxos recording of the opera. Carpenter pinpoints Adams&#x27;s &quot;uncanny talent for recognising the dramatic possibilities of continually repeating melodies, harmonies and rhythms&quot;, and his ability to change the mix of these elements to reflect the onstage action. The feel of the Nixon era is recreated through popular music references; Sellars has observed that some of the music associated with Nixon is derived from the big band sound of the late 1930s, when the Nixons fell in love. Other commentators have noted Adams&#x27;s limitations as a melodist, and his reliance for long stretches on what critic Donal Henahan has described as &quot;a prosaically chanted recitative style&quot;. However, Robert Hugill, reviewing the 2006 English National Opera revival, found that the sometimes tedious &quot;endless arpeggios&quot; are often followed by gripping music which immediately re-engages the listener&#x27;s interest. This verdict contrasts with that of Davis after the original Houston performance; Davis commented that Adams&#x27;s inexperience as an opera writer was evident in often &quot;turgid instrumentation&quot;, and that at points where &quot;the music must be the crucial and defining element ... Adams fails to do the job&quot;.

== Recordings ==
The opera has been recorded at least six times:

The only studio recording, made in New York by Nonesuch two months after the October 1987 Houston premiere, used the same cast, just a different chorus, orchestra and conductor: Edo de Waart led the Chorus and Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s. &quot;Gramophone&#x27;s Good DVD Guide&quot; praised the singing, noting James Maddalena&#x27;s &quot;aptly volatile Nixon&quot; and Trudy Ellen Craney&#x27;s admirable delivery of Chiang Ch&#x27;ing&#x27;s coloratura passages. This recording also received the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Composition in the Classical category. It was reissued in 2011 to coincide with the opera&#x27;s production at the Metropolitan Opera. The Denver live recording on Naxos has Marin Alsop conducting the Colorado Symphony and Opera Colorado Chorus, with Robert Orth as Nixon, Maria Kanyova as Pat Nixon, Thomas Hammons as Kissinger, Chen-Ye Yuan as Chou En-Lai, Marc Heller as Mao Tse-Tung and Tracy Dahl as Chiang Ch&#x27;ing. Sumi Jo and June Anderson star as the two wives in the Paris video.

<doc id="262620" wikidata="Q803814" url="?curid=262620" title="Binaural (album)">
<text>Binaural is the sixth studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, released May 16, 2000, through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour in support of its previous album, &quot;Yield&quot; (1998), Pearl Jam took a short break before reconvening toward the end of 1999 to begin work on a new album. During the production of the album, the band encountered hindrances such as singer Eddie Vedder&#x27;s writer&#x27;s block, and guitarist Mike McCready&#x27;s entrance into rehabilitation due to an addiction to prescription drugs. This is Pearl Jam&#x27;s first album to feature former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, who joined during 1998&#x27;s Yield Tour to replace Jack Irons.

The music on the album featured an experimental sound, evident on songs that used binaural recording techniques. The atmospheric tracks, mostly featuring somber lyrics dealing with social criticism, led the band to convey these themes with images of nebulas in the album artwork. &quot;Binaural&quot; received positive reviews, and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Although the album was certified gold by the RIAA, it became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach Platinum status in the United States. The album&#x27;s 2000 tour spawned a large collection of official bootleg releases.

==Recording==
Similar to the process for &quot;Yield&quot;, the band members worked on material individually before starting the recording sessions together. Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder called the making of the album &quot;a construction job.&quot; &quot;Binaural&quot; was the first album since the band&#x27;s debut that was not produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien. Gossard stated that the band &quot;felt like it was time to try something new,&quot; and that they &quot;were ready for a change.&quot; 
Instead the band hired producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of binaural recording. Binaural recording techniques, which employ two microphones to create a 3-D stereophonic sound, were used on several tracks, such as the acoustic &quot;Of the Girl.&quot; Regarding Blake, Gossard said, &quot;He was just there for us the whole time, wanting us to create different moods.&quot; This was the first Pearl Jam studio album following the departure of drummer Jack Irons, and features drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, who had previously drummed on Pearl Jam&#x27;s U.S. Yield Tour.

&quot;Binaural&quot; was recorded in late 1999 and early 2000 in Seattle, Washington, at Studio Litho, which is owned by guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was initially mixed at Sunset Sound Factory in Los Angeles, California, with Blake; however, the band proved to be dissatisfied with how the mixes turned out. According to McCready, Blake&#x27;s work complemented the slower tracks such as &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot; well, but faced trouble with others, which the band wanted to sound heavier. For the heavier songs, the group brought in former producer O&#x27;Brien, who remixed the tracks at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. It was with O&#x27;Brien that the band determined the final sequencing of the album.

During the writing and recording of the album, the band encountered several obstacles. Vedder has admitted that while working on the album he suffered from writer&#x27;s block, which made it difficult for him to come up with lyrics. This inspired the hidden track &quot;Writer&#x27;s Block&quot; - which consists of the sounds of a typewriter - that appears at the end of the album, starting at 6 minutes and 50 seconds on the track &quot;Parting Ways&quot;. Vedder had written music for several songs, including &quot;Insignificance&quot; and &quot;Grievance&quot;, but was having trouble coming up with lyrics for the songs. He decided to not write any more music, and to focus only on lyrics, even banning himself from playing guitar. Unable to write more lyrics, Vedder said he saw a ukulele and thought &quot;that&#x27;s not a guitar,&quot; and wrote the song &quot;Soon Forget&quot; using the ukulele. Guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for an addiction to prescription drugs. Gossard recalled that &quot;everyone wasn&#x27;t on the same page&quot; due to McCready&#x27;s absence and the familiarization with Cameron.

Three instrumentals featured on the &quot;Touring Band 2000&quot; DVD (&quot;Thunderclap&quot;, &quot;Foldback&quot;, and &quot;Harmony&quot;) come from the early &quot;Binaural&quot; sessions. Several songs were rejected from the album that eventually found their way on to the 2003 &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; collection of rarities. These include &quot;Sad&quot;, &quot;Hitchhiker&quot;, &quot;In the Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;, &quot;Fatal&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Lew&quot;. &quot;Sad&quot;, originally called &quot;Letter to the Dead&quot;, was called &quot;a great pop song&quot; by Ament, but he said the song did not fit the album because the band does not &quot;really [write] very many pop records.&quot; &quot;Sweet Lew&quot;, about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, was cut from &quot;Binaural&quot; because it did not fit the album according to Ament. &quot;Fatal&quot; was producer Tchad Blake&#x27;s favorite song to come out of the recording sessions. &quot;Strangest Tribe&quot; and &quot;Drifting&quot; were also recorded around the time of the album&#x27;s recording sessions, and both songs were released on the band&#x27;s 1999 fan club Christmas single as well as &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Binaural&quot; opens with three up-tempo songs before growing more diverse. Vedder explained, &quot;We&#x27;d rather challenge our fans and make them listen to our songs than give them something that&#x27;s easy to digest. There is a lot of music out there that is very easy to digest but we never wanted to be part of it.&quot; As described by critic Jon Pareles on his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Pearl Jam distances itself from the grunge that made them famous and &quot;delve[s] elsewhere: jumpy post-punk and somber meditations, tightly wound folk rock and turbulent, neopsychedelic rockers that sound like they boiled out of jam sessions.&quot;

A few songs on the album show classic rock influences. The intro to the opening track &quot;Breakerfall&quot; uses a guitar riff similar to The Who song &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; (from the 1967 album, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;). Additionally, &quot;Soon Forget&quot;, which features Vedder playing a ukulele, is heavily influenced by The Who song &quot;Blue, Red and Grey&quot; (from the 1975 album, &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot;), with Vedder describing it as &quot;30 seconds of plagiarising&quot; and thanking Pete Townshend on the lyric sheet. The song &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot; has been compared to the style of Pink Floyd.

Bassist Jeff Ament wrote lyrics for two songs on the album (&quot;Gods&#x27; Dice&quot; and &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot;), and Gossard for three (&quot;Thin Air,&quot; &quot;Of the Girl&quot; and &quot;Rival&quot;). The album is lyrically darker than the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Yield&quot;, with Gossard describing the lyrics as &quot;pretty somber.&quot; Vedder addressed the social criticism contained in the album&#x27;s lyrics by stating, &quot;I think what everyone&#x27;s looking for, y&#x27;know, is freedom...That&#x27;s part of being comfortable in your own skin. I know I had a problem with being told what to do, and had a problem with being mentally and physically constricted. All of humanity is searching for freedom and I think it&#x27;s important to know when you have it, too.&quot; Ament stated that &quot;Gods&#x27; Dice&quot; is about &quot;judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in God or not&quot;, and that &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot; is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of Northern Montana. Vedder called &quot;Evacuation&quot; a &quot;song about change&quot;, and stated in an interview that the moral of &quot;Insignificance&quot; is &quot;the ineffectiveness of political struggle.&quot; Vedder took inspiration from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle when writing &quot;Grievance&quot;, and said the song is about the dangers of technology. Gossard has said that the song &quot;Rival&quot; is his reflection upon the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover art is a modified Hubble Space Telescope photo of the planetary nebula MyCn 18, popularly known as the Hourglass Nebula. Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used with the permission of NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, &quot;The reason that we went with Tchad [Blake] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs...So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that...One of the themes that we&#x27;ve been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it&#x27;s still pretty minuscule. I think for me the whole space theme has a lot to do with scale. You know, you look at some of those pictures, and there are thirteen light years in four inches in that picture.&quot;

The album&#x27;s title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks. Binaural literally means &quot;having or relating to two ears.&quot; Regarding the choice of the title, Gossard said, &quot;When we looked up the word &#x27;binaural,&#x27; it meant to listen with both ears. So it seemed like a fitting title for the album.&quot;

==Release and reception==

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Binaural&quot; sold 226,000 copies during its first week of release and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. It was held off the top spot by the Britney Spears album, &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;. &quot;Binaural&quot; became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach Platinum status. &quot;Binaural&quot; has been certified gold by the RIAA, and, as of 2013, has sold 850,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album topped the charts in New Zealand, where it was certified Platinum, and Australia, where it went Platinum and ended as the 36th best-selling record of the year.

Two singles were released from &quot;Binaural&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot;, was issued on April 25, 2000, entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 49, and reached number three on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album&#x27;s other single, &quot;Light Years&quot;, was released on July 10, 2000, and did not chart on the Hot 100, but it did place on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Binaural&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics according to Metacritic, where it holds a 69 after 16 reviews. &quot;NME&quot; gave &quot;Binaural&quot; a nine out of 10. In the review, &quot;Binaural&quot; is called &quot;a seething, furious album; a declamatory statement against cynicism and passivity and the simple injustices of everyday life&quot; and that &quot;even when the band slow the pace, the songs are coloured by a heartfelt intensity.&quot; AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, saying, &quot;The songs are sharper, the production is layered, and the performances are as compassionate as ever, resulting in their finest album since &quot;Vitalogy&quot;.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; reviewer Christopher John Farley noted that the album is &quot;less impatient and rage filled than much of Pearl Jam&#x27;s earlier work.&quot; Farley added that &quot;Pearl Jam, rather quietly, is building a long-term career to rival the rock legends of the past.&quot; Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B+, considering that the &quot;weighty subjects [give] Pearl Jam&#x27;s introspective lyrics and stone-faced rock a refreshing edge&quot; and adding that &quot;if PJ long ago lost the zeitgeist, at least they&#x27;ve kept a hold on their hearts.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau described the album as &quot;Rock as inner struggle, eternally externalized.&quot;

&quot;Spin&quot; gave the album seven out of 10 stars, writing that &quot;Everything you want is still there—goofy experimentalism, guitar frenzy, Eddie&#x27;s self-abusive wail. It&#x27;s just more solid, more clear.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that &quot;Grunge may have died, but Pearl Jam it seems will never be slayed.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer Jon Pareles gave the album three and a half out of five stars, feeling that the album &quot;comes across as part of an extended conversation among the five band members...and fans loyal enough to check in for Pearl Jam&#x27;s latest musings on love, death and social responsibility.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; also gave the album three out of five stars, stating that Pearl Jam &quot;are dignified, musicianly, sincere... and a teensy bit dull&quot; and observing that &quot;Vedder&#x27;s affecting vocal angst drowns in a sea of pessimistic riffola.&quot; The review called &quot;Binaural&quot; &quot;a warts-and-all album; it has grabbers, songs that sink in slowly and a few absolute duds.&quot; At the 2001 Grammy Awards, &quot;Grievance&quot; received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. Regarding &quot;Binaural&quot;, Ament stated that &quot;we look back and think we didn&#x27;t put some of the best songs on it&quot;, adding that &quot;I think there are some beautiful things that came out of it, but we&#x27;re never going to remember that record as one of the greats.&quot;

==Tour==
Pearl Jam promoted the album with tours in Europe and North America. The tour started along with the album release on May 23, with a show in Lisbon, Portugal. The European tour had 26 dates. The final concert of the European tour ended in tragedy, where an accident at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark on June 30 led nine fans to be crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. This led two additional concerts through July to be cancelled. A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on a two-leg North American tour, starting on Virginia Beach, Virginia on August 3. The first leg of the tour focused on the East Coast of the United States, and then the band moved to the Midwest and the West Coast for the tour&#x27;s second leg. The band considered disbanding after the Roskilde tragedy, but Vedder stated that &quot;playing, facing crowds, being together&quot; in the North American tour &quot;enabled us to start processing it.&quot;

On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, celebrating the 10th anniversary of its first live performance as a band. The tour&#x27;s final night took place on November 6, 2000, in Seattle, Washington at KeyArena where the band performed for more than three hours. The European and North American tours were documented by a long series of official bootlegs, all of which were available in record stores as well as through the band&#x27;s fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the same time. Following the conclusion of the 2000 tour, the band released &quot;Touring Band 2000&quot;, a DVD which featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.

&quot;Binaural&quot; was played in its entirety at the May 10, 2016 show in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre, as a block and in sequence, during the first set of a longer performance.

===Original track listing===
When the track listing for &quot;Binaural&quot; was first released in late March 2000, it was quite different from the final version. Some tracks that were originally on the album were dropped and not released until the 2003 rarities compilation, &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;, and &quot;Gods&#x27; Dice&quot; was added to the final version. The original version is as follows:

#&quot;Breakerfall&quot;
#&quot;Insignificance&quot;
#&quot;Evacuation&quot;
#&quot;Letter to the Dead&quot;
#*Later renamed to &quot;Sad&quot;
#&quot;Rival&quot;
#&quot;Grievance&quot;
#&quot;Light Years&quot;
#&quot;Of the Girl&quot;
#&quot;Thin Air&quot;
#&quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot;
#&quot;Fatal&quot;
#&quot;Sleight of Hand&quot;
#&quot;Soon Forget&quot;
#&quot;In the Moonlight&quot;
#&quot;Parting Ways&quot;
#&quot;Education&quot;

<doc id="262621" wikidata="Q1570035" url="?curid=262621" title="Darrieus wind turbine">
<text>The Darrieus wind turbine is a type of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) used to generate electricity from wind energy. The turbine consists of a number of curved aerofoil blades mounted on a rotating shaft or framework. The curvature of the blades allows the blade to be stressed only in tension at high rotating speeds. There are several closely related wind turbines that use straight blades. This design of the turbine was patented by Georges Jean Marie Darrieus, a French aeronautical engineer; filing for the patent was October 1, 1926. There are major difficulties in protecting the Darrieus turbine from extreme wind conditions and in making it self-starting.

==Method of operation==


In the original versions of the Darrieus design, the aerofoils are arranged so that they are symmetrical and have zero rigging angle, that is, the angle that the aerofoils are set relative to the structure on which they are mounted. This arrangement is equally effective no matter which direction the wind is blowing—in contrast to the conventional type, which must be rotated to face into the wind.

When the Darrieus rotor is spinning, the aerofoils are moving forward through the air in a circular path. Relative to the blade, this oncoming airflow is added vectorially to the wind, so that the resultant airflow creates a varying small positive angle of attack to the blade. This generates a net force pointing obliquely forwards along a certain &quot;line of action&quot;. This force can be projected inwards past the turbine axis at a certain distance, giving a positive torque to the shaft, thus helping it to rotate in the direction it is already travelling in. The aerodynamic principles which rotate the rotor are equivalent to that in autogiros, and normal helicopters in autorotation.

As the aerofoil moves around the back of the apparatus, the angle of attack changes to the opposite sign, but the generated force is still obliquely in the direction of rotation, because the wings are symmetrical and the rigging angle is zero. The rotor spins at a rate unrelated to the windspeed, and usually many times faster. The energy arising from the torque and speed may be extracted and converted into useful power by using an electrical generator.

The aeronautical terms lift and drag are, strictly speaking, forces across and along the approaching net relative airflow respectively, so they are not useful here. The forces at play are rather tangential force, which pulls the blade around, and radial force, which acts against the bearings.

When the rotor is stationary, no net rotational force arises, even if the wind speed rises quite high—the rotor must already be spinning to generate torque. Thus the design is not normally self-starting. Under rare conditions, Darrieus rotors can self-start, so some form of brake is required to hold it when stopped.

One problem with the design is that the angle of attack changes as the turbine spins, so each blade generates its maximum torque at two points on its cycle (front and back of the turbine). This leads to a sinusoidal (pulsing) power cycle that complicates design. In particular, almost all Darrieus turbines have resonant modes where, at a particular rotational speed, the pulsing is at a natural frequency of the blades that can cause them to (eventually) break. For this reason, most Darrieus turbines have mechanical brakes or other speed control devices to keep the turbine from spinning at these speeds for any lengthy period of time.

Another problem arises because the majority of the mass of the rotating mechanism is at the periphery rather than at the hub, as it is with a propeller. This leads to very high centrifugal stresses on the mechanism, which must be stronger and heavier than otherwise to withstand them. One common approach to minimise this is to curve the wings into an &quot;egg-beater&quot; shape (this is called a &quot;troposkein&quot; shape, derived from the Greek for &quot;the shape of a spun rope&quot;) such that they are self-supporting and do not require such heavy supports and mountings. See. Fig. 1.

In this configuration, the Darrieus design is theoretically less expensive than a conventional type, as most of the stress is in the blades which torque against the generator located at the bottom of the turbine. The only forces that need to be balanced out vertically are the compression load due to the blades flexing outward (thus attempting to &quot;squeeze&quot; the tower), and the wind force trying to blow the whole turbine over, half of which is transmitted to the bottom and the other half of which can easily be offset with guy wires.

By contrast, a conventional design has all of the force of the wind attempting to push the tower over at the top, where the main bearing is located. Additionally, one cannot easily use guy wires to offset this load, because the propeller spins both above and below the top of the tower. Thus the conventional design requires a strong tower that grows dramatically with the size of the propeller. Modern designs can compensate most tower loads of that variable speed and variable pitch.

In overall comparison, while there are some advantages in Darrieus design there are many more disadvantages, especially with bigger machines in the MW class. The Darrieus design uses much more expensive material in blades while most of the blade is too close to the ground to give any real power. Traditional designs assume that the wing tip is at least 40 m from ground at lowest point to maximize energy production and lifetime. So far there is no known material (not even carbon fiber) which can meet cyclic load requirements.

== Giromills ==
Darrieus&#x27;s 1927 patent also covered practically any possible arrangement using vertical airfoils. One of the more common types is the H-rotor,
also called the Giromill or H-bar design, in which the long &quot;egg beater&quot; blades of the common Darrieus design are replaced with straight vertical blade sections attached to the central tower with horizontal supports. This design is used by Shanghai based MUCE.

== Cycloturbines ==

Another variation of the Giromill is the Cycloturbine, in which each blade is mounted so that it can rotate around its own vertical axis. This allows the blades to be &quot;pitched&quot; so that they always have some angle of attack relative to the wind. The main advantage to this design is that the torque generated remains almost constant over a fairly wide angle, so a Cycloturbine with three or four blades has a fairly constant torque. Over this range of angles, the torque itself is near the maximum possible, meaning that the system also generates more power. The Cycloturbine also has the advantage of being able to self-start, by pitching the &quot;downwind moving&quot; blade flat to the wind to generate drag and start the turbine spinning at a low speed. On the downside, the blade pitching mechanism is complex and generally heavy, and some sort of wind-direction sensor needs to be added in order to pitch the blades properly.

==Helical blades==

The blades of a Darrieus turbine can be canted into a helix, e.g. three blades and a helical twist of 60 degrees. The original designer of the helical turbine is Ulrich Stampa (Germany patent DE2948060A1, 1979). A. Gorlov proposed a similar design in 1995 (Gorlov&#x27;s water turbines). Since the wind pulls each blade around on both the windward and leeward sides of the turbine, this feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution, thus preventing destructive pulsations. This design is used by the Turby, Urban Green Energy, Enessere, Aerotecture and Quiet Revolution brands of wind turbine.

==Active lift turbine==
The relative speed creates a force on the blade. This force can be decomposed into an axial and normal force (Fig. 5). In the case of a Darrieus turbine, the axial force associated with the radius creates a torque and the normal force creates on the arm a stress alternately for each half turn, a compression stress and an extension stress. With a crank rod system (Fig. 6), the principle of the Active Lift Turbine is to transform this alternative constraint into an additional energy recovery.

<text>Riot Act is the seventh studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, released November 12, 2002, through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour in support of their previous album, &quot;Binaural&quot; (2000), Pearl Jam took a year-long break. The band reconvened in the beginning of 2002 and commenced work on a new album. The music on the album was diverse, including songs influenced by folk, art rock and experimental rock. The lyrics deal with mortality and existentialism, with influence from both the political climate after the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam&#x27;s performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival.

The band supported the album with a politically motivated concert tour in 2003. &quot;Riot Act&quot; was the band&#x27;s last album of all-new material for Epic. The album received mostly positive reviews, and has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States.

==Recording==
Producer Adam Kasper was brought in to work with the band on its seventh album. Kasper had engineered other Pearl Jam albums, and was brought to produce following a suggestion by drummer Matt Cameron, who worked with Kasper on his previous groups Wellwater Conspiracy and Soundgarden. &quot;Riot Act&quot; was recorded in two sessions in February 2002 and April 2002 at Studio X in Seattle. The album was mixed by Brendan O&#x27;Brien at Studio X.

Similar to the process for &quot;Yield&quot; and &quot;Binaural&quot;, band members worked on material individually before starting the recording sessions together. According to Cameron, everyone in the band had &quot;four or five&quot; ideas coming into the sessions, and there was &quot;a lot to just kind of weed through and work on.&quot; The band often recorded material intended to be demo recordings, but lead vocalist Eddie Vedder would come along and record his vocals afterwards, stating, &quot;I just sang it, that&#x27;s the take.&quot; Regarding the creative process, guitarist Stone Gossard said that while playing alone &quot;the anal-retentive side of you goes, &#x27;I think I could play better.&#x27;&quot;, but when reuniting &quot;the entire band goes &#x27;No, it&#x27;s great as it is,&#x27; then you just get in the mood and embrace it.&quot; Gossard stated that &quot;the process of letting go is constant in this band&quot;, adding that bandmembers would arrive with &quot;a clear idea of what a song is going to be&quot; but eschew for other musical ideas while discussing the song with the group. &quot;Riot Act&quot; was the first Pearl Jam album to feature Kenneth &quot;Boom&quot; Gaspar on keyboards, most notably on the song &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;. According to Gaspar, the song initially developed out of a jam session he had with Vedder in Hawaii shortly after the two first met. When they were done, Vedder asked Gaspar if he was &quot;ready to go to Seattle.&quot; According to Gossard, bringing in Gaspar was about being &quot;open to new things&quot;, while Vedder stated Gaspar &quot;was able to find his place&quot; and fit in easily with the band dynamics. Guitarist Mike McCready said that he had always wanted the band to feature keyboards.

McCready described the recording environment as &quot;a pretty positive one&quot; and &quot;very intense and spiritual.&quot; Cameron said that producer Adam Kasper created a &quot;really relaxed&quot; atmosphere and that the band was able to complete lot of material in a short amount of time. Vedder set up his typewriter in a corner of the studio and would write lyrics as the band members played their material. Most of the album was recorded live, with Cameron describing the album as &quot;our anti-Pro Tools record.&quot; Gossard said that the band fed off Cameron&#x27;s playing as well as Vedder&#x27;s excitement about the recording process.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Riot Act&quot; features a diverse sound, including folk-based and experimental songs. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said &quot;&quot;Riot Act&quot; is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since &quot;Vitalogy&quot;—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that&#x27;s filled with ragged edges and odd detours.&quot; Gossard said &quot;&quot;Riot Act&quot; really seems to showcase all of our thing. There&#x27;s the simple rock songs we could have written in the earlier era, but it covers all the different times and dynamics we&#x27;ve had and still holds together.&quot; The musical experiments led several songs on the album to use alternate tunings, including &quot;You Are&quot;, &quot;All or None&quot; and &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot;.
The lyrics on &quot;Riot Act&quot; were more direct than on preceding records, in response to the political climate after the September 11 attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the much more personal tragedy of the accidental deaths of nine fans during Pearl Jam&#x27;s performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – &quot;You start feeling like, &#x27;What do I have to say? What is my opinion?&#x27; Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that &quot;I think the time&#x27;s right to turn our voice up a bit... And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn&#x27;t just, &#x27;We&#x27;re pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!&#x27; Cos I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the method. At least at this point.&quot; Vedder, however, said, &quot;I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we, as a country, need to understand why we&#x27;re involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me.&quot; The singer added that the &quot;Riot Act&quot; lyrics &quot;represent[ed] my state of mind these days. I&#x27;m optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated.&quot; Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;I Am Mine&quot;, written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band&#x27;s first show after Roskilde, and &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; including a brief lyrical reference (&quot;Lost nine friends we&#x27;ll never know... two years ago today&quot;). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, &quot;There&#x27;s been a lot of mortality...It&#x27;s a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.&quot;

A few songs feature lyrical collaborations between Vedder and other members of the group: one with Ament (&quot;Ghost&quot;), one with Cameron (&quot;You Are&quot;) and two with Gossard (&quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot; and &quot;All or None&quot;). Sole lyrical contributions from band members other than Vedder include Cameron with &quot;Get Right&quot; and Ament with &quot;Help, Help&quot; The album&#x27;s lyrics tackle existential matters (&quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, &quot;Cropduster&quot; and &quot;I Am Mine&quot;), as well as social and political concerns (&quot;Green Disease&quot;, &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot; and &quot;1/2 Full&quot;). The lyrics of &quot;Save You&quot; represent the anger felt by anyone watching a close friend waste away his or her life. Regarding &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, Vedder said, &quot;Love is one resource that corporations aren&#x27;t going to be able to monopolize.&quot; Vedder said that &quot;Cropduster&quot; is &quot;about man&#x27;s giant ego, that he&#x27;s the most important thing on the planet.&quot; Regarding &quot;Green Disease&quot;, Vedder stated he was &quot;mystified&quot; at corporate-management salaries and &quot;how someone can justify taking that much at the cost of other people&#x27;s livelihoods.&quot; &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot; is a satirical commentary on President George W. Bush.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover art, photographed by Ament, features two skeletons wearing crowns, suggesting the possibility that the two represent a king and a queen. The metal figurines were forged by blacksmith Kelly Gilliam. According to Ament, the band had trouble coming up with a name for the album. After the artwork had been finalized and the tracks were sequenced, the band spent weeks trying to come up with a title. Vedder suggested &quot;Riot Act&quot;, and the band members went with it as they were tired with trying to come up with a title. McCready stated that the title has no real significance. He said, &quot;I guess we were trying to come up with a title that reflected some of the music on the record, which we thought was urgent-sounding and kind of loud...It just seemed to fit.&quot; Ament implied that the title has to do with &quot;getting your act together.&quot;

==Tour==

Pearl Jam promoted the album with tours in Australia, Japan, and North America in 2003. The tours were the band&#x27;s first with keyboardist Boom Gaspar. The two legs of the North American tour focused on the Midwestern United States, the East Coast, and the West Coast, and had more concerts in arenas. The trauma of Roskilde led the tour to lack performances on festivals and open floor venues.

The band received much publicity for its energetic politically charged performances during the tour. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot; with a rubber mask of George W. Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had &quot;impaled&quot; the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band&#x27;s show of April 1, 2003, in Denver, Colorado show at the Pepsi Center. Following a performance of the song at Pearl Jam&#x27;s show of April 30, 2003, in Uniondale, New York, at the Nassau Coliseum, the band was met with boos from the crowd and chants of &quot;U-S-A.&quot; Vedder responded by defending his right to free speech and the band followed with a performance of the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Know Your Rights&quot;. The song &quot;Arc&quot; was performed by Vedder at nine shows during the second North American leg of the tour as a tribute to the victims of the Roskilde disaster. The concerts were documented by a long series of official bootlegs, all of which were available through the band&#x27;s official website, and six of which were released in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. Two concerts became DVDs, the Seattle one being issued as &quot;Live at the Showbox&quot;, and the first of two shows at Madison Square Garden was released as the &quot;Live at the Garden&quot; DVD. Pearl Jam also supported the album&#x27;s material at a series of political rallies and benefit concerts while preparing for its eighth studio album.

==Release and reception==

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Riot Act&quot; reached number five in the U.S. on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, with 166,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album would end up selling only 575,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan, short of the 850,000 sold by predecessor &quot;Binaural&quot;. &quot;Riot Act&quot; has been certified gold by the RIAA. It became the band&#x27;s first album not to chart in the top two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The international response to &quot;Riot Act&quot; was more positive. The album topped the charts in Australia, where it went platinum and ended among the best-selling records of the year in both 2002 and 2003. &quot;Riot Act&quot; also went to number two in both Italy, and New Zealand, three in Norway, and number four in Canada.

Three singles were released from &quot;Riot Act&quot;. Lead single &quot;I Am Mine&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 43, and reached number six on the Modern rock charts. While &quot;Save You&quot; was released as the second single for North America, &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; was the second single for international markets. &quot;Save You&quot; did not chart on the Hot 100, but it did place on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts. Music videos for several songs from the album, including &quot;I Am Mine&quot;, &quot;Save You&quot;, &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot;, and &quot;1/2 Full&quot;, were filmed at Seattle&#x27;s Chop Suey club in September 2002.

&quot;All or None&quot; experienced a surge in popularity following its inclusion in &quot;Left Behind&quot;, the seventh episode of the HBO series &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, with Spotify streams increasing by over 5,000% in the first 24 hours after the episode&#x27;s release.

===Critical response===
&quot;Riot Act&quot; received favorable reviews from music critics according to Metacritic, where it holds a 73 after 20 reviews. &quot;NME&quot; gave &quot;Riot Act&quot; an eight out of ten. Reviewer Louis Pattison stated that &quot;&quot;Riot Act&quot; is the sound of a band entering a powerful middle-age. They still deserve your attention.&quot; AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, saying &quot;given several plays, this does indeed seem like the richest record Pearl Jam has made in a long time.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; gave the album seven out of ten stars. The review said, &quot;Pearl Jam&#x27;s seventh studio album balances emotive bombast with a taut-sweaty hard-rock attack.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau described Pearl Jam on the album as &quot;masters of their own audio, with soft spots where their emotions can go.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer Keith Harris gave the album three out of five stars, saying that &quot;like Neil Young at his most deliberately despondent, Pearl Jam sound purposefully tired.&quot; Chris Willman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B, saying that Vedder&#x27;s lyrics &quot;rarely cohere&quot;, and that &quot;too few of the tense rhythmic setups build to the kind of...catharsis that would be something to &quot;Riot&quot; home about.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; gave the album three out of five stars. The review called the album &quot;An adult rock record in which nuance succeeds over bombast.&quot;

Hugo Lindgren of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the &quot;record sounds as if it were made to slip quietly into the marketplace, connect with the faithful and leave everyone else alone&quot;, and that &quot;there&#x27;s no catchy single, and not even the slightest echo of anything else happening in pop music now.&quot; He added that the &quot;band&#x27;s grooves still sound taut, emotive and world-class.&quot; Adam Sweeting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the album two out of five stars. In the review he stated that &quot;&quot;Riot Act&quot; isn&#x27;t one thing or the other: tracks such as &quot;Ghost&quot; or &quot;Get Right&quot; gesture towards hard rock without really putting the hammer down, while a more reflective piece like &quot;All or None&quot; doesn&#x27;t exploit its own possibilities.&quot; Sweeting observed, &quot;On full, Pearl Jam sound like Stillwater, Cameron Crowe&#x27;s fictional 1970s second-raters from his film &quot;Almost Famous&quot;.&quot; Kyle Reiter of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said that the album &quot;meanders from one song to the next with an overwhelming insipidness&quot;, and stated that it &quot;[brings] them ever closer to homogenous bar-band territory.&quot;

==Track listing==
===Outtakes===
The album&#x27;s singles featured three B-sides from the &quot;Riot Act&quot; recording sessions that were not included on the album: &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Undone&quot; and &quot;Other Side&quot;. &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Undone&quot; were B-sides on the &quot;I Am Mine&quot; single, and &quot;Other Side&quot; was featured on the &quot;Save You&quot; and &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; singles. All three were included on the 2003 &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; collection of rarities, although &quot;Undone&quot; appeared in a slightly different form. McCready said that &quot;Down&quot; came out lighter than intended, and was ultimately left off &quot;Riot Act&quot; because it did not fit with the other songs on the album. Also recorded during the sessions was &quot;4/20/02&quot;, a song honoring Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley that Vedder wrote the day that he heard the news of Staley&#x27;s death. According to Vedder, &quot;4/20/02&quot; wasn&#x27;t included on &quot;Riot Act&quot; because the band already had too many songs, but it was included on &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;, albeit in the form of a hidden track. A recording of &quot;Severed Hand&quot;, a song that appeared on the band&#x27;s next studio album &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, was attempted during the recording sessions; however the band only spent a few hours on the song before it was shelved. &quot;Last Soldier&quot;, a live version of which was recorded at the 2001 Bridge School Benefit and included on the band&#x27;s 2001 fan club Christmas single, was written by McCready and Vedder in response to the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. McCready said the band played around with the song, but never seriously considered recording it for &quot;Riot Act&quot;.

<text>Chinua Achebe (; born Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe; 16 November 1930 – 21 March 2013) was a Nigerian novelist, poet, and critic who is regarded as a central figure of modern African literature. His first novel and magnum opus, &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; (1958), occupies a pivotal place in African literature and remains the most widely studied, translated, and read African novel. Along with &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, his &quot;No Longer at Ease&quot; (1960) and &quot;Arrow of God&quot; (1964) complete the &quot;African Trilogy&quot;. Later novels include &quot;A Man of the People&quot; (1966) and &quot;Anthills of the Savannah&quot; (1987). Achebe is often referred to as the &quot;father of modern African literature&quot;, although he vigorously rejected the characterization.

Born in Ogidi, Colonial Nigeria, Achebe&#x27;s childhood was influenced by both Igbo traditional culture and colonial Christianity. He excelled in school and attended what is now the University of Ibadan, where he became fiercely critical of how Western literature depicted Africa. Moving to Lagos after graduation, he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and garnered international attention for his 1958 novel &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. In less than 10 years he would publish four further novels through the publisher Heinemann, with whom he began the Heinemann African Writers Series and galvanized the careers of African writers, such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o and Flora Nwapa.

Achebe sought to escape the colonial perspective that framed African literature at the time, and drew from the traditions of the Igbo people, Christian influences, and the clash of Western and African values to create a uniquely African voice. He wrote in and defended the use of English, describing it as a means to reach a broad audience, particularly readers of colonial nations. In 1975 he gave a controversial lecture, &quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;&quot;, which was a landmark in postcolonial discourse. Published in &quot;The Massachusetts Review&quot;, it featured criticism of Albert Schweitzer and Joseph Conrad, whom Achebe described as &quot;a thoroughgoing racist.&quot; When the region of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe supported Biafran independence and acted as ambassador for the people of the movement. The subsequent Nigerian Civil War ravaged the populace, and he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon became disillusioned by his frustration over the continuous corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the US in 1990 after a car crash left him partially paralyzed. He stayed in the US in a nineteen-year tenure at Bard College as a professor of languages and literature.

Winning the 2007 Man Booker International Prize, from 2009 until his death he was Professor of African Studies at Brown University. Achebe&#x27;s work has been extensively analyzed and a vast body of scholarly work discussing it has arisen. In addition to his seminal novels, Achebe&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; includes numerous short stories, poetry, essays and children&#x27;s books. A titled Igbo chief himself, his style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. Among the many themes his works cover are culture and colonialism, masculinity and femininity, politics, and history. His legacy is celebrated annually at the Chinua Achebe Literary Festival.
==Life and career==
===Youth and background (1930–1947)===
Chinua Achebe was born on 16 November 1930 and baptised Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe. His father, Isaiah Okafo Achebe, was a teacher and evangelist, and his mother, Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam, was the daughter of a blacksmith from Awka, a leader among church women, and a vegetable farmer. His birthplace was Saint Simon&#x27;s Church, Nneobi, which was near the Igbo village of Ogidi; the area was part of the British colony of Nigeria at the time. Isaiah was the nephew of Udoh Osinyi, a leader in Ogidi with a &quot;reputation for tolerance&quot;; orphaned as a young man, Isaiah was an early Ogidi convert to Christianity. Both Isaiah and Janet stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence, which made a significant impact on the children, especially Chinua. His parents were converts to the Protestant Church Mission Society (CMS) in Nigeria. As such, Isaiah stopped practising Odinani, the religious practices of his ancestors, but continued to respect its traditions. The Achebe family had five other surviving children, named in a fusion of traditional words relating to their new religion: Frank Okwuofu, John Chukwuemeka Ifeanyichukwu, Zinobia Uzoma, Augustine Ndubisi, and Grace Nwanneka. After the youngest daughter was born, the family moved to Isaiah Achebe&#x27;s ancestral town of Ogidi, in what is now the state of Anambra.

Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community. Achebe&#x27;s mother and his sister Zinobia told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books—including a prose adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; () and an Igbo version of Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678). Achebe eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the constant masquerade ceremonies, which he would later recreate in his novels and stories.

In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips&#x27; Central School in the Akpakaogwe region of Ogidi for his primary education. Despite his protests, he spent a week in the religious class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school&#x27;s chaplain took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting and the best reading skills in his class. Achebe had his secondary education at the prestigious Government College Umuahia, in Nigeria&#x27;s present-day Abia State. He attended Sunday school every week and the special services held monthly, often carrying his father&#x27;s bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe enrolled in Nekede Central School, outside of Owerri, in 1942; he was particularly studious and passed the entrance examinations for two colleges.

===University (1948–1953)===
In 1948, Nigeria&#x27;s first university opened in preparation for the country&#x27;s independence. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe was admitted as the university&#x27;s first intake and given a bursary to study medicine. During his studies, Achebe became critical of Western literature about Africa, particularly Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. He decided to become a writer after reading &quot;Mister Johnson&quot; by Joyce Cary because of the book&#x27;s portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist as a sign of the author&#x27;s cultural ignorance. He abandoned medicine to study English, history, and theology, a switch which lost him his scholarship and required extra tuition fees. To compensate, the government provided a bursary, and his family donated money—his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip home from his job as a civil servant so Achebe could continue his studies.

Achebe&#x27;s debut as an author was in 1950 when he wrote a piece for the &quot;University Herald&quot;, the university&#x27;s magazine, entitled &quot;Polar Undergraduate&quot;. It used irony and humour to celebrate the intellectual vigour of his classmates. He followed with other essays and letters about philosophy and freedom in academia, some of which were published in another campus magazine called &quot;The Bug&quot;. He served as the &quot;Herald&quot; editor during the 1951–52 school year. He wrote his first short story that year, &quot;In a Village Church&quot; (1951), an amusing look at the Igbo synthesis between life in rural Nigeria with Christian institutions and icons. Other short stories he wrote during his time at Ibadan—including &quot;The Old Order in Conflict with the New&quot; (1952) and &quot;Dead Men&#x27;s Path&quot; (1953)—examine conflicts between tradition and modernity, with an eye toward dialogue and understanding on both sides. When the professor Geoffrey Parrinder arrived at the university to teach comparative religion, Achebe began to explore the fields of Christian history and African traditional religions.

After the final examinations at Ibadan in year 1953, Achebe was awarded a second-class degree. Rattled by not receiving the highest level, he was uncertain how to proceed after graduation and returned to his hometown of Ogidi. While pondering possible career paths, Achebe was visited by a friend from the university, who convinced him to apply for an English teaching position at the Merchants of Light school at Oba. It was a ramshackle institution with a crumbling infrastructure and a meagre library; the school was built on what the residents called &quot;bad bush&quot;—a section of land thought to be tainted by unfriendly spirits.

===Teaching and producing (1953–1956)===

As a teacher he urged his students to read extensively and be original in their work. The students did not have access to the newspapers he had read as a student, so Achebe made his own available in the classroom. He taught in Oba for four months. He left the institution in 1954 and moved to Lagos to work for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS), a radio network started in 1933 by the colonial government. He was assigned to the Talks Department to prepare scripts for oral delivery. This helped him master the subtle nuances between written and spoken language, a skill that helped him later to write realistic dialogue.

Lagos made a significant impression on him. A huge conurbation, the city teemed with recent migrants from the rural villages. Achebe revelled in the social and political activity around him and began work on a novel. This was challenging since very little African fiction had been written in English, although Amos Tutuola&#x27;s &quot;Palm-Wine Drinkard&quot; and Cyprian Ekwensi&#x27;s &quot;People of the City&quot; were notable exceptions. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 highlighted issues of colonialism and politics, and was a significant moment for Achebe.

Also in 1956, Achebe was selected to attend the staff training school for the BBC. His first trip outside Nigeria was an opportunity to advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met the novelist Gilbert Phelps, to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he could show it to his editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work.

===&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; (1957–1960)===

Back in Nigeria, Achebe set to work revising and editing his novel; he titled it &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, after a line in the poem &quot;The Second Coming&quot; by W. B. Yeats. He cut away the second and third sections of the book, leaving only the story of a yam farmer named Okonkwo who lives during the colonization of Nigeria and struggles with his father&#x27;s debtor legacy. He added sections, improved various chapters, and restructured the prose.

In 1957 he sent his only copy of his handwritten manuscript (along with the £22 fee) to a London manuscript typing service he had seen an advertisement for in &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He did not receive a reply from the typing service, so he asked his boss at the NBS, Angela Beattie, to visit the company during her travels to London. She did, and angrily demanded to know why the manuscript was lying ignored in the corner of the office. The company quickly sent a typed copy to Achebe. Beattie&#x27;s intervention was crucial for his ability to continue as a writer. Had the novel been lost, he later said, &quot;I would have been so discouraged that I would probably have given up altogether.&quot; The next year Achebe sent his novel to the agent recommended by Gilbert Phelps in London. It was sent to several publishing houses; some rejected it immediately, claiming that fiction from African writers had no market potential. The executives at Heinemann read the manuscript and hesitated in their decision to publish the book. An educational adviser, Donald MacRae, read the book and reported to the company that: &quot;This is the best novel I have read since the war.&quot; Heinemann published 2,000 hardcover copies of &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; on 17 June 1958. According to Alan Hill, employed by the publisher at the time, the company did not &quot;touch a word of it&quot; in preparation for release.

The book was received well by the British press, and received positive reviews from critic Walter Allen and novelist Angus Wilson. Three days after publication, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; wrote that the book &quot;genuinely succeeds in presenting tribal life from the inside&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; called it &quot;an excellent novel&quot;, and the literary magazine &quot;Time and Tide&quot; said that &quot;Mr. Achebe&#x27;s style is a model for aspirants&quot;. Initial reception in Nigeria was mixed. When Hill tried to promote the book in West Africa, he was met with scepticism and ridicule. The faculty at the University of Ibadan was amused at the thought of a worthwhile novel being written by an alumnus. Others were more supportive; one review in the magazine &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; said: &quot;The book as a whole creates for the reader such a vivid picture of Igbo life that the plot and characters are little more than symbols representing a way of life lost irrevocably within living memory.&quot; When &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; was published in 1958, Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network&#x27;s Eastern region coverage. That same year Achebe began dating Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, a woman who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. The couple moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties.

===&quot;No Longer at Ease&quot; and fellowship travels (1960–1961)===
In 1960 Achebe published &quot;No Longer at Ease&quot;, a novel about a civil servant named Obi, grandson of &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;″s main character, who is embroiled in the corruption of Lagos. Obi undergoes the same turmoil as much of the Nigerian youth of his time; the clash between the traditional culture of his clan, family, and home village against his government job and modern society. Later that year, Achebe was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship for six months of travel, which he called &quot;the first important perk of my writing career&quot;.

Achebe used the fellowship to tour East Africa. He first travelled to Kenya, where he was required to complete an immigration form by checking a box indicating his ethnicity: European, Asiatic, Arab, or Other. Shocked and dismayed at being forced into an &quot;Other&quot; identity, he found the situation &quot;almost funny&quot; and took an extra form as a souvenir. Continuing to Tanganyika and Zanzibar (now united in Tanzania), he was frustrated by the paternalistic attitude he observed among non-African hotel clerks and social elites. Achebe found in his travels that Swahili was gaining prominence as a major African language. Radio programs were broadcast in Swahili, and its use was widespread in the countries he visited. Nevertheless, he found an &quot;apathy&quot; among the people toward literature written in Swahili. He met the poet Sheikh Shaaban Robert, who complained of the difficulty he had faced in trying to publish his Swahili-language work. In Northern Rhodesia (now called Zambia), Achebe found himself sitting in a whites-only section of a bus to Victoria Falls. Interrogated by the ticket taker as to why he was sitting in the front, he replied, &quot;if you must know I come from Nigeria, and there we sit where we like in the bus.&quot; Upon reaching the waterfall, he was cheered by the black travellers from the bus, but he was saddened by their being unable to resist the policy of segregation at the time.

Two years later, Achebe travelled to the United States and Brazil as part of a Fellowship for Creative Artists awarded by UNESCO. He met with a number of writers from the US, including novelists Ralph Ellison and Arthur Miller. In Brazil, he discussed the complications of writing in Portuguese with other authors. Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the nation would be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language.

===Voice of Nigeria and African Writers Series (1961–1964)===
On his return to Nigeria in 1961, Achebe was promoted at the NBS to the position of Director of External Broadcasting. One of his primary duties was to help create the Voice of Nigeria (VON) network, which broadcast its first transmission on New Year&#x27;s Day 1962. VON struggled to maintain neutrality when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa declared a state of emergency in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became particularly saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition. The same year he attended an executive conference of African writers in English at the Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda. He met with literary figures including Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor, Nigerian playwright and novelist Wole Soyinka, and American poet Langston Hughes. Among the topics of discussion was an attempt to determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora, or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not &quot;a very significant question&quot;, and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work was large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond.

While at Makerere, Achebe was asked to read a novel written by a student named James Ngugi (later known as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o) called &quot;Weep Not, Child&quot;. Impressed, he sent it to Alan Hill at Heinemann, which published it two years later to coincide with its paperback line of books from African writers. Achebe also recommended works by Flora Nwapa. Achebe became the General Editor of the African Writers Series, a collection of postcolonial literature from African writers. As these works became more widely available, reviews and essays about African literature—especially from Europe—began to flourish.

Achebe published an essay entitled &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; in the December 1962 issue of &quot;Nigeria Magazine&quot; in reaction to critiques African work was receiving from international authors. The essay distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He lashed out at those who critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: &quot;no man can understand another whose language he does not speak (and &#x27;language&#x27; here does not mean simply words, but a man&#x27;s entire worldview).&quot; In September 1964 he attended the Commonwealth Literature conference at the University of Leeds, presenting his essay &quot;The Novelist as Teacher&quot;.

====Personal life====
Achebe and Christie married on 10 September 1961, holding the ceremony in the Chapel of Resurrection on the campus of the University of Ibadan. Their first child, a daughter named Chinelo, was born on 11 July 1962. They had a son, Ikechukwu, on 3 December 1964, and another boy, Chidi, on 24 May 1967. Their last child, a daughter, named Nwando, was born on 7 March 1970. When the children began attending school in Lagos, their parents became worried about the worldview—especially with regard to race, gender and how Africans were portrayed—expressed at the school, particularly through the mostly white teachers and books that presented a prejudiced view of African life. In 1966, Achebe published his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Chike and the River&quot;, to address some of these concerns.

===&quot;Arrow of God&quot; (1964–1966)===
Achebe&#x27;s third book, &quot;Arrow of God&quot;, was published in 1964. The idea for the novel came in 1959, when Achebe heard the story of a Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer. He drew further inspiration a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by archaeologist Thurstan Shaw; Achebe was startled by the cultural sophistication of the artefacts. When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers, Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on &quot;Arrow of God&quot;. Like Achebe&#x27;s previous works, &quot;Arrow&quot; was roundly praised by critics. A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called &quot;certain structural weaknesses&quot;.

Like its predecessors, the work explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity. Set in the village of Umuaro at the start of the twentieth century, the novel tells the story of Ezeulu, a Chief Priest of Ulu. Shocked by the power of British imperialism in the area, he orders his son to learn the foreigners&#x27; secrets. Ezeulu is consumed by the resulting tragedy. In a letter written to Achebe, American writer John Updike expressed his surprised admiration for the sudden downfall of &quot;Arrow of God&quot;″s protagonist and praised the author&#x27;s courage to write &quot;an ending few Western novelists would have contrived&quot;. Achebe responded by suggesting that the individualistic hero was rare in African literature, given its roots in communal living and the degree to which characters are &quot;subject to non-human forces in the universe&quot;.

===&quot;A Man of the People&quot; (1966–1967)===

Achebe&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;A Man of the People&quot;, was published in 1966. A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence, the novel follows a teacher named Odili Samalu from the village of Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat. Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe&#x27;s friend John Pepper Clark declared: &quot;Chinua, I &quot;know&quot; you are a prophet. Everything in this book has happened except a military coup!&quot; Soon afterwards, Nigerian Army officer Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu seized control of the northern region of the country as part of the 1966 Nigerian coup d&#x27;état. Commanders in other areas failed, and the coup was followed by a military crackdown. A massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards, and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos.

The ending of his novel had brought Achebe to the attention of the Nigerian Armed Forces, who suspected him of having foreknowledge of the coup. When he received word of the pursuit, he sent his wife (who was pregnant) and children on a squalid boat through a series of unseen creeks to the Eastern stronghold of Port Harcourt. They arrived safely, but Christie suffered a miscarriage at the journey&#x27;s end. Chinua rejoined them soon afterwards in Ogidi. These cities were safe from military incursion because they were in the southeast, a part of the region that would later secede.

Once the family had resettled in Enugu, Achebe and his friend Christopher Okigbo started a publishing house called Citadel Press to improve the quality and increase the quantity of literature available to younger readers. One of its first submissions was a story called &quot;How the Dog was Domesticated&quot;, which Achebe revised and rewrote, turning it into a complex allegory for the country&#x27;s political tumult. Its final title was &quot;How the Leopard Got His Claws&quot;. Years later a Nigerian intelligence officer told Achebe, &quot;of all the things that came out of Biafra, that book was most important.&quot;

===Nigeria-Biafra War (1967–1970)===
In May 1967, the southeastern region of Nigeria broke away to form the Republic of Biafra; in July the Nigerian military attacked to suppress what it considered an unlawful rebellion. The Achebe family narrowly escaped disaster several times during the war, including a bombing of their house. In August 1967, Okigbo was killed fighting in the war. Achebe was shaken considerably by the loss; in 1971 he wrote &quot;Dirge for Okigbo&quot;, originally in the Igbo language but later translated to English.

As the war intensified, the Achebe family was forced to leave Enugu for the Biafran capital of Aba. He continued to write throughout the war, but most of his creative work during this time took the form of poetry. The shorter format was a consequence of living in a war zone. &quot;I can write poetry,&quot; he said, &quot;something short, intense more in keeping with my mood [...] All this is creating in the context of our struggle.&quot; Many of these poems were collected in his 1971 book &quot;Beware, Soul Brother&quot;. One of his most famous, &quot;Refugee Mother and Child&quot;, spoke to the suffering and loss that surrounded him. Dedicated to the promise of Biafra, he accepted a request to serve as foreign ambassador, refusing an invitation from the Program of African Studies at Northwestern University in the US. Meanwhile, their contemporary Wole Soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials and spent two years in jail. Speaking in 1968, Achebe said: &quot;I find the Nigerian situation untenable. If I had been a Nigerian, I think I would have been in the same situation as Wole Soyinka is—in prison.&quot; In his ambassador role, Achebe travelled to European and North American cities to promote the Biafra cause.

Conditions in Biafra worsened as the war continued. In September 1968, the city of Aba fell to the Nigerian military and Achebe once again moved his family, this time to Umuahia, where the Biafran government had relocated. He was chosen to chair the newly formed National Guidance Committee, charged with the task of drafting principles and ideas for the post-war era. In 1969, the group completed a document entitled &quot;The Principles of the Biafran Revolution&quot;, later released as &quot;The Ahiara Declaration&quot;. In October of the same year, Achebe joined writers Cyprian Ekwensi and Gabriel Okara for a tour of the United States to raise awareness about the dire situation in Biafra. They visited thirty college campuses and conducted numerous interviews. Although the group was well received by students and faculty, Achebe was shocked by the harsh racist attitude toward Africa he saw in the US. At the end of the tour, he said that &quot;world policy is absolutely ruthless and unfeeling&quot;.

The beginning of 1970 saw the end of the state of Biafra. On 12 January, the military surrendered to Nigeria, and Achebe returned with his family to Ogidi, where their home had been destroyed. He took a job at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka and immersed himself once again in academia. He was unable to accept invitations to other countries, however, because the Nigerian government revoked his passport due to his support for Biafra. The Achebe family had another daughter on 7 March 1970, named Nwando.

===Postwar academia (1971–1975)===

After the war, Achebe helped start two magazines in 1971: the literary journal &quot;Okike&quot;, a forum for African art, fiction, and poetry; and &quot;Nsukkascope&quot;, an internal publication of the university. Achebe and the &quot;Okike&quot; committee later established another cultural magazine, &quot;Uwa Ndi Igbo&quot;, to showcase the indigenous stories and oral traditions of the Igbo community. Achebe handed over the editorship of &quot;Okike&quot; to Onuora Osmond Enekwe, who was later assisted by Amechi Akwanya. In February 1972, Chinua Achebe released &quot;Girls at War&quot;, a collection of short stories ranging in time from his undergraduate days to the recent bloodshed. It was the 100th book in Heinemann&#x27;s African Writers Series.

The University of Massachusetts Amherst offered Achebe a professorship in September 1972, and the family moved to the United States. Their youngest daughter was displeased with her nursery school, and the family soon learned that her frustration involved language. Achebe helped her face what he called the &quot;alien experience&quot; by telling her stories during the car trips to and from school. As he presented his lessons to a wide variety of students (he taught only one class, to a large audience), he began to study the perceptions of Africa in Western scholarship: &quot;Africa is not like anywhere else they know [...] there are no real people in the Dark Continent, only &quot;forces&quot; operating; and people don&#x27;t speak any language you can understand, they just grunt, too busy jumping up and down in a frenzy&quot;.

====Further criticism (1975)====

Achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a Chancellor&#x27;s Lecture at Amherst on 18 February 1975, &quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;&quot;. Decrying Joseph Conrad as &quot;a bloody racist&quot;, Achebe asserted that Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; dehumanises Africans, rendering Africa as &quot;a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril.&quot; Achebe also discussed a quotation from Albert Schweitzer, a 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate: &quot;That extraordinary missionary, Albert Schweitzer, who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, epitomizes the ambivalence. In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: &#x27;The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.&#x27; And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being.&quot;

The lecture was controversial immediately following his talk. Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: &quot;How dare you!&quot;, and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had &quot;no sense of humour&quot;, but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: &quot;I now realize that I had never really read &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; although I have taught it for years.&quot;

Achebe&#x27;s criticism has become a mainstream perspective on Conrad&#x27;s work. The essay was included in the 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad&#x27;s novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of &quot;the three most important events in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; criticism since the second edition of his book.&quot; Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad&#x27;s criticism &quot;into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe.&quot; Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: &quot;It&#x27;s not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it—with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works.&quot; Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel in October 2009, Achebe stated that he was still critical of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. He tempered this criticism in a discussion entitled &quot;&#x27;Heart of Darkness&#x27; is inappropriate&quot;, stating: &quot;Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And if it were not for what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction.&quot;

===Retirement and politics (1976–1986) ===
After his service at UMass Amherst and a visiting professorship at the University of Connecticut, Achebe returned to the University of Nigeria in 1976, where he held a chair in English until his retirement in 1981. When he returned to the University of Nigeria, he hoped to accomplish three goals: finish the novel he had been writing, renew the native publication of &quot;Okike&quot;, and further his study of Igbo culture. In an August 1976 interview, he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, stating that the archetype was divorced from the intellect &quot;but for two things: status and stomach. And if there&#x27;s any danger that he might suffer official displeasure or lose his job, he would prefer to turn a blind eye to what is happening around him.&quot; In October 1979, Achebe was awarded the first-ever Nigerian National Merit Award.

After his 1981 retirement, he devoted more time to editing &quot;Okike&quot; and became active with the left-leaning People&#x27;s Redemption Party (PRP). In 1983, he became the party&#x27;s deputy national vice-president. He published a book called &quot;The Trouble with Nigeria&quot; to coincide with the upcoming elections. On the first page, Achebe says: &quot;the Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility and to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership.&quot; The elections that followed were marked by violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics had changed since &quot;A Man of the People&quot;, Achebe replied: &quot;I think, if anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated.&quot; After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument—which almost became a fistfight—with Sabo Bakin Zuwo, the newly elected governor of Kano State. He left the PRP and kept his distance from political parties, expressing sadness with his perception of the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved.

He spent most of the 1980s delivering speeches, attending conferences, and working on his sixth novel. In 1986 he was elected president-general of the Ogidi Town Union; he reluctantly accepted and began a three-year term. In the same year, he stepped down as editor of &quot;Okike&quot;.

===&quot;Anthills&quot; and paralysis (1987–1999) ===

In 1987 Achebe released his fifth novel, &quot;Anthills of the Savannah&quot;, about a military coup in the fictional West African nation of Kangan. A finalist for the Booker Prize, the novel was hailed in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;: &quot;in a powerful fusion of myth, legend and modern styles, Achebe has written a book which is wise, exciting and essential, a powerful antidote to the cynical commentators from &#x27;overseas&#x27; who see nothing ever new out of Africa.&quot; An opinion piece in the magazine &quot;West Africa&quot; said the book deserved to win the Booker Prize, and that Achebe was &quot;a writer who has long deserved the recognition that has already been accorded him by his sales figures.&quot; The prize went instead to Penelope Lively&#x27;s novel &quot;Moon Tiger&quot;.

On 22 March 1990, Achebe was riding in a car to Lagos when an axle collapsed and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but the weight of the vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Soon afterwards, Achebe became the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; he held the position for more than fifteen years. Throughout the 1990s, Achebe spent little time in Nigeria but remained actively involved in the country&#x27;s politics, denouncing the usurpation of power by General Sani Abacha.

===Later years and death (2000–2013)===

In 2000 Achebe published &quot;Home and Exile&quot;, a semi-biographical collection of both his thoughts on life away from Nigeria, as well as discussion of the emerging school of Native American literature. In October 2005, the London &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Achebe was planning to write a novella for the &quot;Canongate Myth Series&quot;, a series of short novels in which ancient myths from myriad cultures are reimagined and rewritten by contemporary authors.

Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize in June 2007. The judging panel included American critic Elaine Showalter, who said he &quot;illuminated the path for writers around the world seeking new words and forms for new realities and societies&quot;; and South African writer Nadine Gordimer, who said Achebe&#x27;s &quot;early work made him the father of modern African literature as an integral part of world literature.&quot; The award helped correct what &quot;many perceived as a great injustice to African literature, that the founding father of African literature had not won some of the key international prizes.&quot; For the International Festival of Igbo culture, Achebe briefly returned to Nigeria to give the Ahajioku Lecture. Later that year he published &quot;The Education of A British-Protected Child&quot;, a collection of essays. In autumn he joined the Brown University faculty as the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor of Africana Studies. In 2010, Achebe was awarded The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize for $300,000, one of the richest prizes for the arts.

In 2012, Achebe published &quot;There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra&quot;. The work re-opened the discussion about the Nigerian Civil War. It would be his last publication during his lifetime; Achebe died after a short illness on 21 March 2013 in Boston, United States. An unidentified source close to the family said that he was ill and was hospitalised in the city. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him in his obituary as &quot;one of Africa&#x27;s most widely read novelists and one of the continent&#x27;s towering men of letters.&quot; The BBC wrote that he was &quot;revered throughout the world for his depiction of life in Africa&quot;. He was buried in his hometown of Ogidi.

==Style==
===Oral tradition===
The style of Achebe&#x27;s fiction draws heavily on the oral tradition of the Igbo people. He incorporates folk tales into his stories, exposing community values in both the content and the form of storytelling. For example, the tale about the Earth and Sky in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; emphasises the interdependency of the masculine and the feminine. Although Nwoye enjoys hearing his mother tell the tale, Okonkwo&#x27;s dislike for it is evidence of his imbalance.

Achebe used proverbs to describe the values of the rural Igbo tradition. He includes them throughout the narratives, repeating points made in conversation. Critic Anjali Gera notes that the use of proverbs in &quot;Arrow of God&quot; &quot;serves to create through an echo effect the judgement of a community upon an individual violation.&quot; The use of such repetition in Achebe&#x27;s urban novels, &quot;No Longer at Ease&quot; and &quot;A Man of the People&quot;, is less pronounced.

Achebe&#x27;s short stories are not as widely studied as his novels, and Achebe himself did not consider them a major part of his work. In the preface for &quot;Girls at War and Other Stories&quot;, he writes: &quot;A dozen pieces in twenty years must be accounted a pretty lean harvest by any reckoning.&quot; Like his novels, the short stories are heavily influenced by the oral tradition. They often have morals emphasising the importance of cultural traditions, as influenced by folk tales.

===Use of English===
During decolonisation in the 1950s, a debate about choice of language erupted and pursued authors around the world. Achebe&#x27;s work is scrutinised for its subject matter, insistence on a non-colonial narrative, and use of English. In his essay &quot;English and the African Writer&quot;, Achebe discusses how the process of colonialism—for all its ills—provided colonised people from varying linguistic backgrounds &quot;a language with which to talk to one another&quot;. As his purpose is to communicate with readers across Nigeria, he uses &quot;the one central language enjoying nationwide currency&quot;. Using English also allowed his books to be read in the colonial ruling nations.

Achebe recognises the shortcomings of what Audre Lorde called &quot;the master&#x27;s tools&quot;. In another essay, he notes:

In another essay, he refers to James Baldwin&#x27;s struggle to use the English language to accurately represent his experience and his realisation that he needed to take control of the language and expand it. Achebe&#x27;s novels were a foundation for this process; by altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transformed the language into a distinctly African style. In some spots this takes the form of repetition of an Igbo idea in standard English parlance; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences.

==Themes==
In his early writing, a depiction of the Igbo culture itself is paramount. Critic Nahem Yousaf highlights the importance of these depictions: &quot;Around the tragic stories of Okonkwo and Ezeulu, Achebe sets about textualising Igbo cultural identity&quot;. The portrayal of indigenous life is not simply a matter of literary background, he adds: &quot;Achebe seeks to produce the effect of a precolonial reality as an Igbo-centric response to a Eurocentrically constructed imperial &#x27;reality&#x27; &quot;. Certain elements of Achebe&#x27;s depiction of Igbo life in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; match those in Olaudah Equiano&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;Narrative&quot;. Responding to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa, Achebe wrote in 1975: &quot;Equiano was an Igbo, I believe, from the village of Iseke in the Orlu division of Nigeria&quot;.

===Tradition and colonialism===
A prevalent theme in Achebe&#x27;s novels is the intersection of African tradition (particularly Igbo varieties) and modernity, especially as embodied by European colonialism. For example, the village of Umuofia in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is violently shaken with internal divisions when the white Christian missionaries arrive. Nigerian English professor Ernest N. Emenyonu describes the colonial experience in the novel as &quot;the systematic emasculation of the entire culture&quot;. Achebe later embodied this tension between African tradition and Western influence in the figure of Sam Okoli, the president of Kangan in &quot;Anthills of the Savannah&quot;. Distanced from the myths and tales of the community by his Westernised education, he does not have the capacity for reconnection shown by the character Beatrice.

The colonial impact on the Igbo in Achebe&#x27;s novels is often affected by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in &quot;No Longer at Ease&quot; succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, Achebe demonstrated in &quot;No Longer at Ease&quot; an ability to depict modern Nigerian life.

The standard Achebean ending results in the destruction of an individual, which leads to the downfall of the community. Odili&#x27;s descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in &quot;A Man of the People&quot;, for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere. Even with the emphasis on colonialism, Achebe&#x27;s tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare.

Achebe seeks to portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability. In 1972, he said: &quot;I never will take the stand that the Old must win or that the New must win. The point is that no single truth satisfied me—and this is well founded in the Igbo worldview. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct.&quot; His perspective is reflected in the words of Ikem, a character in &quot;Anthills of the Savannah&quot;: &quot;whatever you are is never enough; you must find a way to accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and to save you from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism.&quot; In a 1996 interview, Achebe said: &quot;Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things ... Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness.&quot;

===Masculinity and femininity===
The gender roles of men and women, as well as society&#x27;s conceptions of the associated concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe&#x27;s writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. The African studies scholar Rose Ure Mezu suggests that Achebe is representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, or that he purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Conversely, the scholar Ajoke Mimiko Bestman has stated that reading Achebe through the lens of womanism is &quot;an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women&quot; which acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women and highlights the resistance and dignity of African women, which enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity.

According to Bestman, in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; Okonkwo&#x27;s furious manhood overpowers everything &quot;feminine&quot; in his life, including his own conscience, while Achebe&#x27;s depiction of the &quot;chi&quot;, or personal god, has been called the &quot;mother within&quot;. Okonkwo&#x27;s father was considered an &quot;agbala&quot;—a word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with &#x27;woman&#x27;. Okonkwo&#x27;s feminization of his father&#x27;s laziness and cowardice is typical of the Igbo perspective on any man seen as unsuccessful. His obsession with maleness is fueled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through the physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority—despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership. The desire for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of &quot;Nneka&quot; (&quot;Mother is supreme&quot;) in chapter fourteen. The perseverance and love from Okonkwo&#x27;s second wife Ekwefi towards Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood. Okonkwo&#x27;s defeat is seen by Mezu and literature scholar Nahem Yousaf as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos. Bestman argued that Okonkwo&#x27;s failures are tied to his contempt for and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life. Achebe expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that &quot;I want to sort of scream that &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is on the side of women [...] And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, all the things he did wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine.&quot; On this, Bestman states that Okonkwo&#x27;s violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society.

==Influence and legacy==
===Overview===
Achebe is regarded as the most dominant and influential writer of modern African literature, and has been called the &quot;father of African literature&quot;, the &quot;founding father of African literature&quot;, and the &quot;&#x27;father of the African novel in English&quot;. Achebe rejected such descriptions as patronising and eurocentric, which were qualities his work sought to critique in the first place. He countered white descriptions of himself as such by claiming that &quot;education is lacking in most of those who pontificate&quot;. &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; has been described as the most important book in modern African literature and was described as his masterpiece by critic Dwight Garner. Selling over 20 million copies worldwide, it has been translated into 57 languages, making Achebe the most translated, studied, and read African author. His legacy as a writer is particularly unique in regard to its substantial impact on not only African literature but Western literature as well.

At the ceremony for his honorary degree from the University of Kent, professor Robert Gibson said that the Nigerian writer &quot;is now revered as Master by the younger generation of African writers and it is to him they regularly turn for counsel and inspiration.&quot; In November 2015 the theme of the Pan African Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s 22nd International African Writers&#x27; Day and three-day conference was &quot;Celebrating the Life and Works of Chinua Achebe: The Coming of Age of African Literature?&quot; The scholar Simon Gikandi, recalling the schooling of himself and his classmates in Kenya, said &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; &quot;changed the lives of many of us&quot;. The anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela remarked that &quot;There was a writer named Chinua Achebe [...] in whose company the prison walls fell down&quot;.

Outside of Africa, Achebe&#x27;s impact resonates strongly in literary circles. Novelist Margaret Atwood called him &quot;a magical writer—one of the greatest of the twentieth century&quot;. Poet Maya Angelou lauded &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; as a book wherein &quot;all readers meet their brothers, sisters, parents and friends and themselves along Nigerian roads&quot;. Nobel laureate Toni Morrison noted that Achebe&#x27;s work inspired her to become a writer and &quot;sparked her love affair with African literature&quot;.

===Awards and honours===
Achebe received over 30 honorary degrees from universities in Nigeria, Canada, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, including Dartmouth College, Harvard, and Brown. Among his other honours are the first Commonwealth Poetry Prize (1972); the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the Order of the Federal Republic (1979); an Honorary Fellowship of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1982); the St. Louis Literary Award (1999); the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade (2002); the Man Booker International Prize (2007); and the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize (2010). In 1992 he became the first living writer to be represented in the Everyman&#x27;s Library collection (reprints of classic literature) published by Alfred A. Knopf. He was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations Population Fund in 1999.

Although he accepted numerous honours from the Nigerian government, Achebe refused its Commander of the Federal Republic award in 2004. Citing his frustration with the political environment, he explained:

In 2011, Achebe was again offered the Commander of the Federal Republic, but he declined it asserting &quot;the reasons for rejecting the offer when it was first made have not been addressed let alone solved. It is inappropriate to offer it again to me&quot;. Then-President Goodluck Jonathan claimed that Achebe&#x27;s refusal was regrettable and may have been influenced by misinformation, but said he still held him in high regard.

Despite his international renown, Achebe never received the Nobel Prize for Literature, which some—particularly Nigerians—viewed as unjust. In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for &quot;Quality Weekly&quot; how he felt about never winning a Nobel Prize; he replied: &quot;My position is that the Nobel Prize is important. But it is a European prize. It&#x27;s not an African prize ... Literature is not a heavyweight championship. Nigerians may think, you know, this man has been knocked out. It&#x27;s nothing to do with that.&quot; Despite his own indifference, Soyinka reports that immediately after Achebe&#x27;s death he received a great many letters urging him to nominate Achebe posthumously. Soyinka denied such requests, explaining that Achebe &quot;is entitled to better than being escorted to his grave with that monotonous, hypocritical aria of deprivation&#x27;s lament, orchestrated by those who, as we say in my part of the world, &#x27;dye their mourning weeds a deeper indigo than those of the bereaved&#x27;. He deserves his peace. Me too! And right now, not posthumously.&quot;

===Memorials and recognition===
Bard College founded the Chinua Achebe Center in 2005, to &quot;create dynamic projects for the most talented of a new generation of writers and artists of African origin.&quot; Bard also established a Chinua Achebe Fellowship in Global African Studies. Achebe was created the &quot;Ugonabo&quot; of Ogidi, a Nigerian chieftain, by the people of his ancestral hometown in 2013. In Igbo culture, taking a title such as this is the highest honour a man may receive. On Achebe&#x27;s 86th birthday in 2016, young writers in Anambra State began the Chinua Achebe Literary Festival. In December 2019, a memorial bust commemorating Achebe and the opening of the Chinua Achebe Literary Court was unveiled at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Achebe was honoured as &quot;Grand Prix de la Mémoire&quot; (Grand Prize for Memory) of the 2019 edition of the Grand Prix of Literary Associations prize.

<text>The Concert of Europe was a general agreement among the great powers of 19th-century Europe to maintain the European balance of power, political boundaries, and spheres of influence. Never a perfect unity and subject to disputes and jockeying for position and influence, the Concert was an extended period of relative peace and stability in Europe following the Wars of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars which had consumed the continent since the 1790s. There is considerable scholarly dispute over the exact nature and duration of the Concert. Some scholars argue that it fell apart nearly as soon as it began in the 1820s when the great powers disagreed over the handling of liberal revolts in Italy, while others argue that it lasted until the outbreak of World War I and others for points in between. For those arguing for a longer duration, there is generally agreement that the period after the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War (1853–1856) represented a different phase with different dynamics than the earlier period.

The beginnings of the Concert of Europe, known as the Congress System or the Vienna System after the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815), was dominated by the five great powers of Europe: Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Initially envisioning regular Congresses among the great powers to resolve potential disputes, in practice, Congresses were held on an ad hoc basis and were generally successful in preventing or localizing conflicts. The more conservative members of the Concert of Europe, members of the Holy Alliance (Russia, Austria, and Prussia), used the system to oppose revolutionary and liberal movements and weaken the forces of nationalism. The formal Congress System fell apart in the 1820s but peace between the Great Powers continued and occasional meetings reminiscent of the Congresses continued to be held at times of crisis. 

The Concert faced a major challenge in the Revolutions of 1848 which sought national independence, national unity, and liberal and democratic reforms. The 1848 Revolutions were ultimately checked without major territorial changes. However, the age of nationalism ultimately brought the first phase of the Concert to an end, as it was unable to prevent the wars leading to the Italian unification (by the Kingdom of Sardinia) in 1861 and German unification (by Prussia) in 1871 which remade the maps of Europe. Following German unification, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck sought to revive the Concert of Europe to protect Germany&#x27;s gains and secure its leading role in European affairs. The revitalized Concert included Austria (at the time a part of Austria-Hungary), France, Italy, Russia, and Britain, with Germany as the driving continental power. The second phase oversaw a further period of relative peace and stability from the 1870s to 1914, and facilitated the growth of European colonial and imperial control in Africa and Asia without wars between the great powers.

The Concert of Europe certainly ended with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when the Concert proved ultimately unable to handle the collapse of Ottoman power in the Balkans, hardening of the alliance system into two firm camps (the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente), and the feeling among many civilian and military leaders on both sides that a war was inevitable or even desirable.

== Overview ==

The Concert of Europe describes the geopolitical order in Europe from 1814 to 1914, during which the great powers tended to act in concert to avoid wars and revolutions and generally maintain the territorial and political status quo. Particularly in the early years of the Concert, the Concert was maintained through the Congress System – sometimes called the Vienna System – which was a series of Congresses among the great powers to resolve disputes or respond to new issues.

The Concert of Europe is typically viewed in two distinct phases: the first from 1814 to through the early 1860s, and the second from the 1880s to 1914. The first phase, particularly before the Revolutions of 1848, is sometimes known as the Age of Metternich, due to the influence of the Austrian chancellor&#x27;s conservatism and the dominance of Austria within the German Confederation, or as the European Restoration, because of the reactionary efforts of the Congress of Vienna to restore Europe to its state before the French Revolution. The ultimate failure of the Concert of Europe, culminating in the First World War, was driven by various factors including rival alliances and the rise of nationalism. The Congress-focused approach to international affairs continued to be influential in the later League of Nations, the United Nations, the Group of Seven and other multi-lateral summits and organizations.

The Concert of Europe arose from the coalitions which fought against revolutionary and Napoleonic France. The great powers of Austria, Prussia, Russia and the United Kingdom, had combined with a number of minor powers to defeat Napoleon for the final time in the Hundred Days. In the wake of this victory, these four great powers formalized their partnership in the Quadruple Alliance. In time, France under the Bourbon Restoration was established as a fifth member of the Concert, after the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the occupation of France and established the Quintuple Alliance. The Ottoman Empire was later admitted to the Concert of Europe in 1856 with the Treaty of Paris following the Crimean War recognized and guaranteed Ottoman territory.

== Origins ==
The idea of a European federation had been already raised by figures such as Immanuel Kant, Gottfried Leibniz, and Lord Grenville. The Concert of Europe drew upon their ideas and the notion of a balance of power in international relations, so that the ambitions of each great power would be restrained by the others:

The Concert of Europe, as it began to be called at the time, had ... a reality in international law, which derived from the final Act of the Vienna Congress, which stipulated that the boundaries established in 1815 could not be altered without the consent of its eight signatories.

The Concert of Europe was very much a response to the French Revolution. From the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792 to the exile of Napoleon to Saint Helena in 1815, Europe had been almost constantly at war. All the European powers were short of the funds, material, and manpower necessary for further fighting and therefore sought structures to avoid new conflicts. The military conquests of France had resulted in the spread of liberalism throughout much of the continent, including the adoption of the reforms such as the Napoleonic Code. Having seen how the French Revolution had begun with calls for fairly mild reforms but had quickly led to radical democratic reforms and attacks on the aristocracy, the Concert of Europe also sought to tamp down on liberal and democratic movements across the continent. Finally, the French Revolution also provided a model for nationalist movements and both sides in the Napoleonic Wars had sought to exploit nationalist sentiment when convenient to their war aims. For example, the French supported the nationalist rising in Ireland against the British in 1798 and revived hopes of a Polish state by establishing the Duchy of Warsaw in ethnically Polish lands to help fight the Prussians, Russians, and Austrians. The Allies supported nationalist movements in Spain and Germany to encourage resistance against French-established governments there. Along with the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France, the Concert of Europe was in many ways an effort to return as far as possible to the status quo of Europe prior to 1789.

== First phase ==
The first phase of the Concert of Europe is typically described as beginning in 1814 with the Congress of Vienna, and ending in the early 1860s with the Prussian and Austrian invasion of Denmark. This first phase included numerous congresses, including the Congress of Paris in 1856 which some scholars argue represented the apex of the Concert of Europe in its ending of the Crimean War. At first, the leading personalities of the system were British foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh, Austrian chancellor and foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, and Emperor Alexander I of Russia. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord of France was largely responsible for quickly returning the country to its place alongside the other major powers in international diplomacy.

=== The Holy Alliance within the Concert===

The Kingdom of Prussia, and the Austrian and Russian Empires, formed the Holy Alliance on 26 September 1815, with the express intent of preserving Christian social values and traditional monarchism. Only three notable princes did not sign: Pope Pius VII (it was not Catholic enough), Sultan Mahmud II of the Ottoman Empire (too Christian), and the British Prince Regent because his government was a constitutional monarchy with a more liberal political philosophy and did not wish to pledge itself to the policing of continental Europe.

Britain did ratify the Quadruple Alliance, signed on 20 November 1815, the same day as the Second Treaty of Paris was signed, which later became the Quintuple Alliance when France joined in 1818 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

There has been much debate between historians as to which treaty was more influential in the development of international relations in Europe in the two decades following the end of the Napoleonic Wars. In the opinion of historian Tim Chapman, the differences are somewhat academic as the powers were not bound by the terms of the treaties and many of them intentionally broke the terms if it suited them.

The Holy Alliance was an informal alliance led by Russia, Austria, and Prussia which aimed to reduce the influence of secularism and liberalism in Europe. The brainchild of Tsar Alexander I, it gained at least nominal support from many states, partly because most European monarchs did not wish to offend the Tsar by refusing to sign it, and as it bound monarchs personally rather than their governments, it was sufficiently vague to be functionally ignored once signed. In the opinion of Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary at the time of its inception, the Holy Alliance was &quot;a piece of sublime mysticism and nonsense&quot;. Nevertheless, its influence was more long lasting than its contemporary critics expected and was revived in the 1820s as a tool of repression when Britain and France refused to embroil themselves in certain continental matters.

The Quadruple Alliance, by contrast, was a standard treaty, and the great powers did not invite any minor allies to sign it. The primary objective was to bind the signatories to support the terms of the Second Treaty of Paris for 20 years. It included a provision for the High Contracting Parties to &quot;renew their meeting at fixed periods...for the purpose of consulting on their common interests&quot; which were the &quot;prosperity of the Nations, and the maintenance of peace in Europe&quot;. However, the wording of the treaty did not specify what these &quot;fixed periods&quot; were to be and there were no provisions in the treaty for a permanent commission to arrange and organise the conferences. This meant that instead of meeting at &quot;fixed periods&quot; the meetings were arranged on an ad hoc basis, to address specific threats or disputes.

===Congress System===
The &quot;Congress System&quot; was an effort to maintain peace and stability in Europe through regular Congresses of the great powers, similar to the Congress of Vienna, to address pressing issues and resolve disputes through negotiation and coordinated action. The system of regular formal Congresses was short-lived, primarily due to the refusal of Great Britain to take part due to ideological and strategic differences with the Holy Alliance powers.

==== 1814 Congress of Vienna ====
The Concert of Europe began with the 1814–1815 Congress of Vienna, which was designed to bring together the &quot;major powers&quot; of the time in order to stabilize the geopolitics of Europe after the defeat of Napoleon in 1813–1814, and contain France&#x27;s power after the war following the French Revolution. The Congress of Vienna took place from November 1814 to June 1815 in Vienna, Austria, and brought together representatives from over 200 European polities. The Congress of Vienna created a new international world order which was based on two main ideologies: restoring and safeguarding power balancing in Europe; and collective responsibility for peace and stability in Europe among the &quot;Great Powers&quot;.

==== 1818 Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle ====

The 1818 Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle formed the Quintuple Alliance by adding France to the Quadruple Alliance, which had comprised the United Kingdom, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. The ability for this to happen was given by Article V of the Quadruple Alliance, and resulted in ending the occupation of France.

==== 1820 Congress of Troppau ====

The 1820 Congress of Troppau was held in Troppau, Austria by the great powers of the Quintuple Alliance (Russia, Prussia, Austria, France, and the United Kingdom) to discuss and put down the liberal uprising in Naples that caused King Ferdinand I to agree to a constitutional monarchy – which was seen by Prussia and Austria as a threat of liberalism. Other powers present at this Congress include Spain, Naples, and Sicily. At this Congress, the Troppau Protocol was signed, which stated that if States which have undergone a change of government due to a revolution threaten other States, then they are &quot;ipso facto&quot; no longer members of the European Alliance if their exclusion will help to maintain legal order and stability. Furthermore, the Powers of the Alliance would also be bound to peacefully or by means of war bring the excluded State back into the Alliance.

==== 1821 Congress of Laibach ====

The 1821 Congress of Laibach took place in Laibach (now Ljubljana, Slovenia), between the powers of the Holy Alliance (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) in order to discuss the Austrian invasion and occupation of Naples in order to put down the Neapolitan Revolution of 1820 which had forced the King to accept a constitution. Other powers present at this Congress include Naples, Sicily, the United Kingdom, and France. The Congress of Laibach represented beginning tensions within the Concert of Europe, between the Eastern powers of Russia, Prussia, and Austria, versus the Western powers of Britain and France.

==== 1822 Congress of Verona ====

The 1822 Congress of Verona took place in Verona, Italy, between the powers of the Quintuple Alliance (Russia, Prussia, Austria, France, and the United Kingdom), along with Spain, Sicily, and Naples. This Congress dealt with the question of Spanish revolution of 1820; Russia, Prussia, and Austria agreed to support France&#x27;s planned intervention in Spain, while the United Kingdom opposed it. This Congress also looked to deal with the Greek Revolution against Turkey, but due to the opposition of the United Kingdom and Austria to Russian intervention in the Balkans, the Congress of Verona did not end up addressing this issue.

===Collapse of the Congress System===
====Protocol of St. Petersburg (1826)====
The Protocol of St. Petersburg is often cited as the end of the Congress System, as it represented the failure of the Congress of St. Petersburg (1825) to resolve the question of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottomans. Russia, seeking territory and influence in the Black Sea and the Balkans, and to protect the Eastern Orthodox Christians under Muslim Ottoman rule, supported Greek independence and was dissatisfied with other Powers&#x27; desire to treat the uprising as an internal matter and support for the status quo. Russia and the United Kingdom entered a bilateral agreement to enforce their plan, by war if necessary, for a mediated end to the conflict with Greek autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. The other great powers were not consulted in this Protocol and though France later joined, Austria and Prussia opposed the Protocol and the threat it posed to the conservative, anti-nationalist stability they sought to impose on Europe. The Ottomans also rejected the Protocol until their defeat at the Battle of Navarino at the hands of the British, French, Russian, and Greek forces forced them to the negotiating table.

==== 1830 London Conference ====

The London Conference of 1830 dealt with the question of the Belgian–Dutch conflict, which was caused by the 1830 Belgian Revolution where Belgium separated from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Austria, Prussia, and Russia saw Belgium&#x27;s separation as a threat to stability, inviting further revolutions and revolts, and sought to return to the status quo ante. On the other hand, France, now led by the more liberal July Monarchy as a result of its own 1830 revolution, supported Belgium&#x27;s independence, as much of the impetus came from the lack of power of the Francophone and Catholic residents. The United Kingdom was very wary of French plans to annex parts of Belgium, but when no powers were willing to send troops to support the Dutch, and with the ascension of a more liberal Whig government, eventually supported the creation of an independent, neutral Belgium as a buffer state, to which the other Great Powers ultimately agreed.

====Oriental Crisis (1840)====

The Ottoman Empire faced an internal revolt in the 1830s led by the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who sought to create an empire and remove Egypt and Sudan of Ottoman suzerainty. Muhammad Ali&#x27;s demand for control of parts of the Levant and subsequent invasion of Syria threatened to topple the weak Ottoman regime and brought the issue to a head in what became known as the Oriental Crisis of 1840. The Ottomans were supported by Austria, Britain, Prussia, and Russia who sought stability and continuity. France, however, supported Muhammad Ali, a longtime ally in North Africa, hoping to further increase French influence in the Mediterranean through a French-aligned independent Egypt. However, the other four powers agreed in the Convention of London (1840) to act without France. A joint British-Austrian force attacked Egyptian forces and forced Muhammad Ali to accept the Ottoman terms. France threatened war on behalf of Egypt and tried to seek territorial compensation in Europe by reclaiming the Left Bank of the Rhine leading to the Rhine Crisis. However, within a few months, the bellicose French government lost support and the Prime Minister Adolphe Thiers resigned and France&#x27;s new government fell into step with the other great powers. The Oriental Crisis showed that important political questions would still be decided by the great powers; but it also illustrated the destabilizing effect the continued weakening of the Ottoman Empire (the so-called Eastern Question) had on the balance of power. The sabre-rattling triggered several powers to embark on the most significant armament and fortification projects since Napoleon, particularly in France and the German Confederation.

===Decline of the first phase===
====Revolutions of 1848====

The Concert was challenged by the Revolutions of 1848 but was ultimately successful in preventing major changes to the map of Europe. However, the revolts, which combined nationalist and liberal ideas, posed a real threat to the conservative order that had reigned since 1815, as shown by the success of the French uprising ending the July Monarchy and ushering in the Second Republic. However, in response, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and even republican France worked – and in some cases coordinate closely – to defeat the uprisings in Germany, Italy, and Eastern Europe. Britain also sought to preserve the status quo, providing no support to the revolutionaries, and mainly seeking to ensure that no other powers managed to leverage the uprisings into expanded influence in areas of British interest, such as the Mediterranean and the Low Countries.

====Crimean War and the 1856 Congress of Paris====
Sometimes viewed as the end of the first phase, the next blow to the Concert was the Crimean War, the first war between Great Powers since Napoleon. However, the war was marked by being geographically limited to the Crimea and Danubian Principalities rather than a general European war, numerous peace overtures, and serial efforts by the great powers to find a diplomatic solution. The war also illustrated a key piece of the balance of power theory, when the combined efforts of several great powers were marshaled to check the ambitions of a single rival to prevent it becoming too powerful.

The war ended in 1856 with the Congress of Paris, which is sometimes viewed as the pinnacle of the Concert with all outstanding issues surrounding the conflict resolved in a single Congress and resulting in a single treaty.

====Wars of national unification====
The next war between great powers came just three years later in 1859, with what became known as the Second Italian War of Independence. The war was fought between France and Piedmont-Sardinia on the one hand and Austria on the other and resulted in a swift defeat for the Austrians. Lasting only two months and resulting mainly in the transfer of lands to a minor Italian power (Piedmont Sardinia), the war also did not result in a general European war but the transfer of European territory from a great power was unprecedented during the Concert period and presaged the coming decade of wars of national unity which would reshape Europe.

The decline of the Concert was further highlighted by the failure of a ceasefire in 1864 over the issue of Prussia&#x27;s and Austria&#x27;s invasion of Denmark in the Second Schleswig War. As the growth of nationalism led to dissatisfaction with the rule of the Danish crown over ethnically German Holstein and ethnically mixed Schleswig, the German populations of the provinces revolted in 1848 but the threat of intervention by the other major powers prevented the German great powers (Prussia and Austria) from intervening and the First Schleswig War ended in a restoration of the status quo ante. However, by 1863, when a succession crisis caused Denmark to breach the terms of the treaty and attempt to incorporate Schleswig into Denmark, the German powers, Austria and Prussia, responding to national sentiment across the German Confederation and with the excuse that Denmark had violated the existing treaties, both opposed a negotiated settlement. The efforts of the other Powers, primarily Britain, France and Russia at the London Conference of 1864 failed. The collapse of the Concert was further sealed when the war was concluded with a trilateral treaty between Prussia, Austria, and Denmark rather than a larger Congress involving the other Great Powers.

The Second Schleswig War set the stage for the subsequent wars of German unification (the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War) which did not result in interventions by any other great powers and which resulted in significant changes to the map of Europe. These wars, and the wars of Italian unification were concluded among the participants without the approval of non-participant powers in Congresses or Conferences to maintain the balance of power. While various multilateral conferences took place during this period – most notably, the London Conference of 1867 which forestalled war over the Luxembourg Crisis – the cooperative nature of the Concert and its focus on stability was significantly diminished during this time of conflict.

== Second phase ==
The second phase of the Concert of Europe is typically described as beginning in the 1871 and ending in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I. 1871 is the year in which the German and Italian unifications were completed and also the year of the Treaty of London. The second phase saw a further period of peace between the Great Powers and a revival of the conference system for the resolution of disputes. This period was dominated by issues related to colonialism, particularly the Scramble for Africa. However, a number of factors led to the hardening of alliances into two camps, the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the rival Triple Entente (France, Russia, and the United Kingdom), rather than the flexible balance of power system with each Power viewing all others as rivals. In addition, the growth of colonial and imperial power around the world and the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and North Africa meant the Concert&#x27;s goal of territorial and political stability was harder to achieve, eventually leading to the outbreak of war. 

This phase later became known (especially in France) as the Belle Époque, the beautiful epoch, as the two world wars and their consequences made the period preceding the First World War seem like a golden age by comparison.

===Revival of great power conferences===

The second phase saw a revival of great power &quot;conferences&quot; where all the great powers met on an ad hoc basis to resolve crises or disputes by consensus. At the Congress of Berlin following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, despite Russia&#x27;s clear victory on the battlefield and separate peace treaty signed with the Ottomans, the other Great Powers demanded concessions from the Russians and redrew the map of the Balkans based on a broad agreement rather than the terms Russia had imposed militarily. The Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 is often seen as the high point of the second phase, as all great powers and several minor powers agreed on the rules for colonial expansion which defined areas of colonial and imperial control and successfully preempted many disputes concerning colonial expansion in Africa. All the European Great Powers also participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901) in China (alongside the United States and Japan), to affirm and defend the unequal treaties signed between China and Western powers in the preceding decades. Two major international conferences at the Hague led to the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and illustrated the continuing desire for peace and stability within Europe. While these do reveal a continuation of the norm of grand Conferences to preserve the status quo, the Conventions were largely ignored in the First World War, many proposals were vetoed or not adopted by all Great Powers, and non-European and minor Powers played an important role.

===Decline of the second phase===
The fall of the second phase of the Concert of Europe can be attributed largely to the rival alliance systems – the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) – which formed a rift in the European States. These rival alliances threatened the underlying nature of the Concert, which relied on &quot;ad hoc&quot; alliances to respond to a given situation. Later conferences including the Algeciras Conference of 1906 defusing the First Moroccan Crisis, showed that the Conference System was still viable for resolving disputes, but further cemented the adversarial relationship between the two camps.

Furthermore, events in the Balkans undermined the Concert as the great powers were not able to preserve the status quo after the First Balkan War. While the London Conference of 1912–1913 called on the great powers to finalize the borders, the success of the minor Balkan states was presented to the great powers as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; and could not be undone. The crisis of July 1914 – the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo which lit the fuse on Balkan tensions – catalyzed the collapse of the Concert of Europe for good, and marked the start of the first World War.

=== Role of nationalism ===

Nationalism played a role in the fall of both the first and second phases of the Concert of Europe, and was generally on the rise around the world before the start of the first World War; nationalism is seen by some scholars as a driving factor in the start of the first World War. Particularly with the fall of the first phase, the rise of nationalism was in almost direct opposition to the core cooperative functions of the Concert, and resulted in States who were no longer well constrained by the Congress system. The outbreak of conflict – namely in the Balkans after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand – highlighted the final failure of the Concert of Europe, in that it was no longer able to constrain State national interests in order to maintain a cooperative international front.

<text>Orthodoxy () is adherence to correct or accepted creeds, especially in religion. Orthodoxy within Christianity refers to acceptance of the doctrines defined by various creeds and ecumenical councils in antiquity, but different Churches accept different creeds and councils. Such differences of opinion have developed for numerous reasons, including language and cultural barriers. Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy are sometimes referred to simply as &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;. In some English-speaking countries, Jews who adhere to all the traditions and commandments as legislated in the Torah are often called Orthodox Jews. Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as &quot;Orthodox Islam&quot;.

==Religions==
===Buddhism===

The historical Buddha was known to denounce mere attachment to scriptures or dogmatic principles, as it was mentioned in the Kalama Sutta. Moreover, the Theravada school of Buddhism follows strict adherence to the Pāli Canon (&quot;tripiṭaka&quot;) and the commentaries such as the Visuddhimagga. Hence, the Theravada school came to be considered the most orthodox of all Buddhist schools, as it is known to be highly conservative especially within the discipline and practice of the Vinaya.

===Christianity===

In classical Christian use, the term &quot;orthodox&quot; refers to the set of doctrines which were believed by the early Christians. A series of ecumenical councils were held over a period of several centuries to try to formalize these doctrines. The most significant of these early decisions was that between the homoousian doctrine of Athanasius and Eustathius (which became Trinitarianism) and the heteroousian doctrine of Arius and Eusebius of Nicomedia (&quot;Arianism&quot;). The homoousian doctrine, which defined Jesus as both God and man with the canons of the 431 Council of Ephesus, won out in the Church and was referred to as &quot;orthodoxy&quot; in most Christian contexts, since this was the viewpoint of previous Christian Church Fathers and was reaffirmed at these councils. (The minority of nontrinitarian Christians object to this terminology.)

Following the 1054 Great Schism, both the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church continued to consider themselves uniquely &quot;orthodox&quot; and &quot;catholic&quot;. Augustine wrote in &quot;On True Religion&quot;: &quot;Religion is to be sought…only among those who are called Catholic or orthodox Christians, that is, guardians of truth and followers of right.&quot; Over time, the Western Church gradually identified with the &quot;Catholic&quot; label, and people of Western Europe gradually associated the &quot;Orthodox&quot; label with the Eastern Church (in some languages the &quot;Catholic&quot; label is not necessarily identified with the Western Church). This was in note of the fact that both Catholic and Orthodox were in use as ecclesiastical adjectives as early as the 2nd and 4th centuries respectively.

Much earlier, the earliest Oriental Orthodox Churches and Chalcedonian Christianity separated in two after the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451), because of several Christological differences. Since then, Oriental Orthodox Churches are maintaining the &quot;orthodox&quot; designation as a symbol of their theological traditions.

Lutheran orthodoxy was an era in the history of Lutheranism, which began in 1580 from the writing of the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; and ended at the Age of Enlightenment. Lutheran orthodoxy was paralleled by similar eras in Calvinism and tridentine Roman Catholicism after the Counter-Reformation. Lutheran scholasticism was a theological method that gradually developed during the era of Lutheran orthodoxy. Theologians used the neo-Aristotelian form of presentation, already popular in academia, in their writings and lectures. They defined the Lutheran faith and defended it against the polemics of opposing parties. Reformed orthodoxy or Calvinist orthodoxy was an era in the history of Calvinism in the 16th to 18th centuries. Calvinist orthodoxy was paralleled by similar eras in Lutheranism and tridentine Roman Catholicism after the Counter-Reformation. Calvinist scholasticism or Reformed scholasticism was a theological method that gradually developed during the era of Calvinist Orthodoxy.

===Hinduism===
Orthodoxy does not exist in Hinduism, as the word &quot;Hindu&quot; itself collectively refers to the various beliefs of people who lived beyond the Sindhu river (Indus river) in India. It is a record of the accepted teachings of each of thousands of gurus, who others equate to prophets, and has no founder, no authority or command, but recommendations. The term most equivalent to orthodoxy at best has the meaning of &quot;commonly accepted&quot; traditions rather than the usual meaning of &quot;conforming to a doctrine&quot;, for example, what people of middle eastern faiths attempt to equate as doctrine in Hindu philosophies is Sanatana Dharma, but which at best can be translated to mean &quot;ageless traditions&quot;, hence denoting that they are accepted not through doctrine and force but through multi-generational tests of adoption and retention based on circumstantial attrition through millennia. Still, the concepts of &quot;āstika&quot; and &quot;nāstika&quot; of Indian philosophy are quite similar to &quot;orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;heterodoxy&quot; respectively, the ātiska being those who accept the epistemic authority of the Vedas.

===Islam===

Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as &quot;Orthodox Islam&quot;. Other scholars of Islam, such as John Burton, believe that there is no such thing as &quot;Orthodox Islam&quot;.

===Judaism===

Orthodox Judaism is a collective term for the traditionalist branches of Judaism, which seek to fully maintain the received Jewish beliefs and observances and which coalesced in opposition to the various challenges of modernity and secularization. Theologically, it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah, both Written and Oral, as literally revealed by God on biblical Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since. The movement advocates a strict observance of &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish Law), which is to be interpreted only according to received methods due to its divine character. Orthodoxy considers &quot;halakha&quot; as eternal and beyond historical influence, being applied differently to changing circumstances but basically unchangeable in itself.

Orthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination. Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate. Very roughly, it may be divided between Haredi Judaism, which is more conservative and reclusive, and Modern Orthodox Judaism, which is relatively open to outer society. Each of those is itself formed of independent streams. They are almost uniformly exclusionist, regarding Orthodoxy as the only authentic form of Judaism and rejecting all non-Orthodox interpretations as illegitimate.

===Others===
Epicureanism is an orthodox secular philosophical belief based on the correct pursuit of pleasure and a natural rather than supernatural worldview. It has forty Principal Doctrines, and Vatican Saying 41 mentions ὀρθῆς φιλοσοφίας φωνὰς ἀφιέντας (&quot;orthes philosophias phonas aphientas&quot;, which translates as &quot;(never cease to) utter the sayings of correct philosophy&quot;).

Kemetic Orthodoxy is a denomination of Kemetism, a reform reconstruction of Egyptian polytheism for modern followers. It claims to derive a spiritual lineage from the Ancient Egyptian religion. There are organizations of Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery) which characterize the religion as Orthodoxy and by other terms.

==Non-religious contexts==

Outside the context of religion, the term &quot;orthodoxy&quot; is often used to refer to any commonly held belief or set of beliefs in some field, in particular, when these tenets – possibly referred to as &quot;dogmas&quot; – are being challenged. In this sense, the term &quot;orthodox&quot; can have a mildly pejorative connotation. Among various &quot;orthodoxies&quot; in distinctive fields, the most commonly used terms include:
* Political orthodoxy
** Orthodox Marxism
* Social orthodoxy
* Economic orthodoxy 
* Scientific orthodoxy 
* Artistic orthodoxy
* Orthodox medicine

The terms &quot;orthodox&quot; and &quot;orthodoxy&quot; are also used more broadly by English-speakers to refer to things other than ideas and beliefs. A new and unusual way of solving a problem could be referred to as &quot;unorthodox&quot;, while a common and &#x27;normal&#x27; way of solving a problem might be referred to as &quot;orthodox&quot;.

== Development ==

The concept of orthodoxy pre-supposes some degree of agreed cultural standardisation – a system of social norms – whereby opinion can distinguish &quot;correct&quot; belief or doctrine from their &quot;incorrect&quot; equivalents. Where world-views or religious sentiment have not developed standardised, generally accepted systems of thought, orthodoxy cannot take root. The development of writing facilitated the gradual canonisation of written scriptures and supra-national philosophies
in the increasingly monotheistic Abrahamic Near East,
but literacy traditions in South Asia and in East Asia did not prevent the growth of religious and political pluralism. Medieval Europe and the post-colonial West saw a turn – subsequently spreading elsewhere – to coercive interest in the belief-systems of the individual (McCarthyism exemplifies a peak in this trend) and in their regulation or &quot;correction&quot; via social control – in the interests of ideological purity
and state homogeneity.

==Related concepts==
Orthodoxy is opposed to &quot;heterodoxy&quot; (&#x27;other teaching&#x27;) or &quot;heresy&quot;. People who deviate from orthodoxy by professing a doctrine considered to be false are called heretics, while those who, perhaps without professing heretical beliefs, break from the perceived main body of believers are called schismatics. The term employed sometimes depends on the aspect most in view: if one is addressing corporate unity, the emphasis may be on schism; if one is addressing doctrinal coherence, the emphasis may be on heresy. A deviation lighter than heresy is commonly called error, in the sense of not being grave enough to cause total estrangement, while yet seriously affecting communion. Sometimes error is also used to cover both full heresies and minor errors. Doctrine or practices not regarded as essential to faith, with which Christians can legitimately disagree, are known as &quot;adiaphora&quot;.

The concept of orthodoxy is prevalent in many forms of organized monotheism. However, orthodox belief is not usually overly emphasized in polytheistic or animist religions, in which there is often little or no concept of dogma, and varied interpretations of doctrine and theology are tolerated and sometimes even encouraged within certain contexts. Syncretism, for example, plays a much wider role in non-monotheistic (and particularly, non-scriptural) religion. The prevailing governing norm within polytheism is often &quot;orthopraxy&quot; (&#x27;right practice&#x27;) rather than the &quot;right belief&quot; of orthodoxy.

<text>Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) describes a service-oriented architecture for a grid computing environment for business and scientific use.
It was developed within the Open Grid Forum, which was called the Global Grid Forum (GGF) at the time, around 2002 to 2006. 

==Description==
OGSA is a distributed interaction and computing architecture based around services, assuring interoperability on heterogeneous systems so that different types of resources can communicate and share information. OGSA is based on several other Web service technologies, such as the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), but it aims to be largely independent of transport-level handling of data.
OGSA has been described as a refinement of a Web services architecture, specifically designed to support grid requirements. 
The concept of OGSA is derived from work presented in the 2002 Globus Alliance paper &quot;The Physiology of the Grid&quot; by Ian Foster, Carl Kesselman, Jeffrey M. Nick, and Steven Tuecke.
It was developed by GGF working groups which resulted in a document, entitled &quot;The Open Grid Services Architecture, Version 1.5&quot; in 2006. 
The GGF published some use case scenarios.

According to the &quot;Defining the Grid: A Roadmap for OGSA Standards v 1.0&quot;, OGSA is:
* An architectural process in which the GGF&#x27;s OGSA Working Group collects requirements and maintains a set of informational documents that describe the architecture;
* A set of normative specifications and profiles that document the precise requirements for a conforming hardware or software component;
* Software components that adhere to the OGSA specifications and profiles, enabling deployment of grid solutions that are interoperable even though they may be based on implementations from multiple sources. 

The Open Grid Services Architecture, Version 1.5 described these capabilities:
* Infrastructure services
* Execution Management services
* Data services
* Resource Management services
* Security services
* Self-management services
* Information services

In late 2006 an updated version of OGSA and several associated documents were published, including the first of several planned normative documents, &quot;Open Grid Services Architecture Glossary of Terms, Version 1.5&quot;. 

The Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) is related to OGSA, as it was originally intended to form the basic “plumbing” layer for OGSA. It was superseded by Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) and WS-Management.

<text>Lerajie (also Leraie, Leraikha, Leraye, Loray, Oray) is a mighty Great Marquis of Hell who has thirty-three legions of Demons under his power. He is said to cause great battles and disputes, and makes gangrene wounds caused by arrows. He can make a lover come to him, and also send them away. He is depicted as a gallant and handsome archer clad in green, carrying a bow and quiver.
Leraje (also &quot;Leraye&quot;, &quot;Leriac&quot;, &quot;Loray&quot;, &quot;Oray&quot;, or &quot;Zoray&quot;) is a demon mentioned in demonological grimoires. He appears in the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, and Jacques Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;.

== Description ==
Leraye is described as an archer who starts battles and putrefies arrow-wounds.

The &quot;Lesser Key&quot; additionally notes that he wears green while Weyer (and so De Plancy) attribute him with the power of driving away mobs.

== Legions and standing ==
Leraye is the fourteenth spirit in the Lesser Key of Solomon (in some versions as Leraje, and in Rudd&#x27;s variant as Leriac), the thirteenth spirit in the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (as Loray or Oray), and appears as Oray in the Dictionnaire Infernal.

In the Grand Grimoire, Leraye (as Loray or Zoray) is listed as a subordinate of Sargatanas. All other sources claim he rules 30 legions of spirits.

According to Rudd, Leraje is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Mehahel.

<doc id="262635" wikidata="Q750192" url="?curid=262635" title="Cyrenaics">
<text>The Cyrenaics or Kyrenaics (), were a sensual hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BCE, supposedly by Aristippus of Cyrene, although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, Aristippus the Younger. The school was so called after Cyrene, the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest Socratic schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain (as it did for Epicurus), but positively enjoyable sensations. Of these, momentary pleasures, especially physical ones, are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. Further, they recognized the value of social obligation and that pleasure could be gained from altruistic behaviour. The school died out within a century and was replaced by the philosophy of Epicureanism.

== History of the school ==

The history of the Cyrenaic school begins with Aristippus of Cyrene, who was born around 435 BCE. He came to Athens as a young man and became a pupil of Socrates. We have only limited knowledge of his movements after the execution of Socrates in 399 BCE although he is said to have lived for a time in the court of Dionysius of Syracuse.

It is uncertain precisely which doctrines ascribed to the Cyrenaic school were formulated by Aristippus. Diogenes Laërtius, based on the authority of Sotion and Panaetius, provided a long list of books said to have been written by Aristippus. However, Diogenes also wrote that Sosicrates had stated that Aristippus had written nothing. Among Aristippus&#x27; pupils was his daughter, Arete of Cyrene, and among her pupils was her son Aristippus the Younger. It was he, according to Aristocles, who created a comprehensive system. At the least, however, it can be said that the foundations of Cyrenaic philosophy were ideas originated by the elder Aristippus, refined by Arete, and then further refined by Aristippus the Younger.

After the time of the younger Aristippus, the school broke up into different factions, represented by Anniceris, Hegesias, and Theodorus, who all developed rival interpretations of Cyrenaic doctrines, many of which were responses to the new system of hedonistic philosophy laid down by Epicurus. By the middle of the 3rd century BC, the Cyrenaic school was obsolete; Epicureanism had largely displaced its Cyrenaic rivals.

== Philosophy ==
The Cyrenaics were hedonists and held that pleasure was the supreme good in life, especially physical pleasure, which they thought more intense and more desirable than mental pleasures. Pleasure is the only good in life and pain is the only evil. Socrates had held that virtue was the only human good, but he had also accepted a limited role for its utilitarian side, allowing pleasure to be a secondary goal of moral action. Aristippus and his followers seized upon this, and made pleasure the sole final goal of life, denying that virtue had any intrinsic value.

=== Epistemology ===
The Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical theory of knowledge. They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth. They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate sense-experiences (for instance, that I am having a sweet sensation now) but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations (for instance, that the honey is sweet). They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like.

All knowledge is of one&#x27;s own immediate sensation. These sensations are motions that are purely subjective, and are painful, indifferent, or pleasant, according as they are violent, tranquil, or gentle. Further, they are entirely individual, and can in no way be described as being of the world objectively. Feeling, therefore, is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct. Our ways of being affected are alone knowable. Thus, the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure.

=== Ethics ===
Cyrenaicism deduces a single, universal aim for all people which is pleasure. Furthermore, all feeling is momentary and homogeneous. It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us, and that among present pleasures, there is no distinction of kind. Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect; the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures, being more simple and more intense, were preferable. Momentary pleasure, preferably of a physical kind, is the only good for humans. When it comes to pain, the Cyrenaics held the opinion that pain that occurs suddenly is more difficult to endure than pain that can be foreseen.

However, some actions that give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them; otherwise, pain will result, and this ability requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life. Regard should be paid to law and custom because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own, violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others. Likewise, friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide. Thus, the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behavior. Like many of the leading modern utilitarians, they combined with their psychological distrust of popular judgments of right and wrong, and their firm conviction that all such distinctions are based solely on law and convention. The equally unwavering principle that the wise person who would pursue pleasure logically must abstain from that which is usually thought wrong or unjust. This idea, which occupies a prominent position in systems like those of Jeremy Bentham, Volney, and even William Paley, was clearly of prime importance to the Cyrenaics.

=== Later Cyrenaics ===
The later Cyrenaics, Anniceris, Hegesias, and Theodorus, all developed variations on the standard Cyrenaic doctrine. For Anniceris, pleasure is achieved through individual acts of gratification that are sought for the pleasure that they produce, but Anniceris laid great emphasis on the love of family, country, friendship, and gratitude that provide pleasure even when they demand sacrifice. Hegesias believed that eudaimonia is impossible to achieve, and hence the goal of life becomes the avoidance of pain and sorrow. Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery are all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain. For Hegesias, Cyrenaic hedonism was simply the least irrational strategy for dealing with the pains of life. For Theodorus, the goal of life is mental pleasure not bodily pleasure, and he placed greater emphasis on the need for moderation and justice. He was also famous for being an atheist. To some extent, these philosophers were all trying to meet the challenge laid down by Epicureanism.

The philosophy of the Cyrenaics around the time of Hegesias of Cyrene evolved in a way that has similarities with Pyrrhonism, Epicurianism and also Buddhism. In fact, there are striking similarities with the tenets of Buddhism, in particular the Four Noble Truths and the concept of Dukkha or &quot;suffering&quot;. Coincidentally, the rulers of Cyrene around the time Hegesias flourished, the Ptolemaic king of Egypt Ptolemy II Philadelphus and from 276 BC the independent king Magas of Cyrene, are both claimed to have been recipients of Buddhist missionaries from the Indian king Ashoka according to the latter&#x27;s Edicts. It is therefore sometimes thought that Hegesias may have been directly influenced by Buddhist teachings through contacts with the alleged missionaries sent to his rulers in the 3rd century BC.

===Other influences===
The Cyrenaic ideal was alien to Christianity, and, in general, subsequent thinkers found it an ideal of hopeless pessimism. Yet in much later times, it has found expression in many ethical and literary works, and it is common also in other ancient non-Hellenic literature. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, there are quatrains in the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and pessimistic verses in the book of Ecclesiastes which might have been uttered by Aristippus. Similarly, in Byron and Heine there is the same tendency to seek relief from the intellectual cul-de-sac in a frankly aesthetic satisfaction. Thus, Cyrenaicism did not entirely vanish with its absorption in Epicureanism.

<text>A Tenured Professor (1990) is a satirical novel by Canadian-American economist and Harvard professor emeritus John Kenneth Galbraith about a liberal university teacher who sets out to change American society by making money and then using it for the public good. Set at Harvard mainly during the Reagan administration, the plot and all the characters that appear in the story are entirely fictitious.

==Plot summary==

The book chronicles the rise to fame of one Montgomery Marvin, a professor of economics who, as an academic teacher, keeps a low profile but who nevertheless is given tenure quite early in his career. While outwardly concerning himself with unspectacular research focusing on &quot;Mathematical Paradigms in an Approach to Refrigerator Pricing&quot; (which is also the title of his Ph.D. thesis), Marvin&#x27;s extracurricular activities centre on becoming very rich in a very short time. For that purpose, Marvin has devised a new formula—a stock forecasting model by means of which he and his wife can cash in on people&#x27;s , greed and, as they call it, dementia. Eventually, while everyone loses money in the wake of the &quot;Black Monday&quot; stock market crash of October 19, 1987, the Marvins gain an awful lot. (See also Michael Milken and leveraged buyout.)

They decide to spend their money wisely, according to their liberal agenda. Intent on strictly observing the code of business ethics, they start to make use of the &quot;positive power of wealth&quot; and embark on a life of philanthropy. They fund a number of chairs in peace studies to be established at, of all places, military academies. They also secure legislation by which companies are required to label their products according to the percentage of female executives employed by them. After they have launched several of their projects, their operations are increasingly considered un-American and officially put under surveillance. But whatever will happen - Marvin knows that he will be able to nourish his family, as he has been accorded tenure.

&quot;A Tenured Professor&quot; was republished as paperback by Houghton Mifflin in 2001 ().

==Reception==
A &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer commented: &quot;Watching Mr. Galbraith&#x27;s &quot;Tenured Professor&quot; and his wife shake up Harvard and cut up the corporate world makes for a lively satire&quot;.

<doc id="262638" wikidata="Q659657" url="?curid=262638" title="Mesite">
<text>The mesites (Mesitornithidae) are a family of birds that are part of a clade (Columbimorphae) that include Columbiformes and Pterocliformes. They are smallish flightless or near flightless birds endemic to Madagascar. All the species of this clade are listed as vulnerable.

== Description ==
The mesites are forest and scrubland birds that feed on insects and seeds; brown and white-breasted mesites forage on the ground, gleaning insects from underneath leaves as well as low vegetation. The subdesert mesite uses its long bill to probe in the soil. Other birds, such as drongos and flycatchers, will follow mesites to catch any insects they flush out or miss. Mesites are vocal birds, with calls similar to a passerine song, used for territorial defence. Two or three white eggs are laid in a stick-built nest located in a bush or on a low branch. The &quot;Mesitornis&quot; species are monogamous while &quot;Monias benschi&quot; is polygamous and, unlike the other two, shows significant sexual dichromatism.

== Systematics ==

There are two genera, &quot;Mesitornis&quot; (2 species) and &quot;Monias&quot; (subdesert mesite).

Historically, mesites&#x27; phylogenetic relationships were not very clear; they have been allied with the Gruiformes, Turniciformes and Columbiformes.

Some phylogenomic studies support Pterocliformes (sandgrouse) as the sister group of mesites while others place this clade with another clade constituted of Columbiformes and Cuculiformes (cuckoos).

<text>Abigor is an Austrian black metal band formed in 1993. They are named after an upper demon of war in Christian demonology.

== Origin ==
The band was formed in 1993 by Peter Kubik and Thomas Tannenberger. After the release of several demos, original vocalist Tharen (Alexander Opitz) left the band and was replaced by Silenius (Michael Gregor), who recorded vocals for all Abigor releases but left in 1998 while their fifth album &quot;Channeling the Quintessence of Satan&quot; was being recorded. Thurisaz who had been in the thrash metal band Lost Victim together with T.T. in the 1980s, joined the band and replaced the vocals of Silenius on the album. In late 1999, T.T. left the band for various reasons (ranging from personal problems to being fed up with what once was the &quot;scene&quot;). After his departure, Abigor released two more albums before breaking up in 2003.

In April 2006, P.K. and T.T. reformed the band, and a year later, &quot;Fractal Possession&quot; was released. The band was scheduled to release a split EP in 2008 with French black metal group Blacklodge. In connection with this release, Abigor was supposedly cooperating with Norwegian experimental artist Zweizz.

The band&#x27;s earlier works were loosely inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The album cover on &quot;Orkblut – The Retaliation&quot; is a collage of 2 paintings originally made by Lord of the Rings fantasy artist Ian Miller, while the album cover on &quot;Channeling the Quintessence of Satan &quot;was originally made by the German printmaker/artist Albrecht Dürer. (&quot;The Knight, Death and the Devil&quot;, 1514)

Most of Abigor releases were released by Napalm Records.

In a 2007 interview, P.K. explained the band&#x27;s songwriting process: &quot;T.T. and I are responsible for the music, A.R. will do the lyrics and vocals, that&#x27;s how it works. I create riffs and record it, T.T. too, we send us files, create rough song-structures till we&#x27;re satisfied with the result of a song/album &quot;concept&quot; then we start the recordings at T.T.&#x27;s Hell-Lab Studio.&quot;In 2014, Silenius rejoined as a session musician, before becoming a permanent member again in 2020.

On September 2, 2024, the band announced founding member Peter Kubik had died of suicide. He was 49. In a statement, the band said: &quot;immortal in his legacy – blood (family), soil (home) and monuments of Black Metal art. walked through the gate by his own hand, through his own will&quot;.

<doc id="262642" wikidata="Q15026" url="?curid=262642" title="Chair">
<text>A chair is a type of seat, typically designed for one person and consisting of one or more legs, a flat or slightly angled seat and a back-rest. It may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics.

Chairs vary in design. An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and features a mechanism that lowers the chair&#x27;s back and raises into place a footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.

==Etymology==
&quot;Chair&quot; comes from the early 13th-century English word &quot;chaere&quot;, from Old French (&quot;chair, seat, throne&quot;), from Latin (&quot;seat&quot;).

== History ==

The chair has been used since antiquity, although for many centuries it was a symbolic article of state and dignity rather than an article for ordinary use. &quot;The chair&quot; is still used as the emblem of authority in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom and Canada, and in many other settings. In keeping with this historical connotation of the &quot;chair&quot; as the symbol of authority, committees, boards of directors, and academic departments all have a &#x27;chairman&#x27; or &#x27;chair&#x27;. Endowed professorships are referred to as chairs.
It was not until the 16th century that chairs became common. Until then, people sat on chests, benches, and stools, which were the ordinary seats of everyday life. The number of chairs which have survived from an earlier date is exceedingly limited; most examples are of ecclesiastical, seigneurial or feudal origin.

Chairs were in existence since at least the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt (). They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today&#x27;s chairs – chair seats were sometimes only high. In ancient Egypt, chairs appear to have been of great richness and splendor. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly materials, magnificent patterns and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. Generally speaking, the higher ranked an individual was, the taller and more sumptuous was the chair he sat on and the greater the honor. On state occasions, the pharaoh sat on a throne, often with a little footstool in front of it.

The average Egyptian family seldom had chairs, and if they did, it was usually only the master of the household who sat on a chair. Among the better off, the chairs might be painted to look like the ornate inlaid and carved chairs of the rich, but the craftsmanship was usually poor.

The earliest images of chairs in China are from 6th-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs at that time was rare. It was not until the 12th century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Christian missionaries in the 7th century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is no longer common to sit at floor level.

In Europe, it was owing in great measure to the Renaissance that the chair ceased to be a privilege of state and became a standard item of furniture for anyone who could afford to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use. Almost at once the chair began to change every few years to reflect the fashions of the day.

Thomas Edward Bowdich visited the main Palace of the Ashanti Empire in 1819, and observed chairs engrossed with gold in the empire. 
In the 1800s, chairs became more common in American households and usually there was a chair provided for every family member to sit down to dinner. By the 1830s, factory-manufactured “fancy chairs” like those by Sears, Roebuck, and Co. allowed families to purchase machined sets. With the Industrial Revolution, chairs became much more available.

The 20th century saw an increasing use of technology in chair construction with such things as all-metal folding chairs, metal-legged chairs, the Slumber Chair, moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs. The recliner became a popular form, at least in part due to radio and television. In the 1930s, stair lifts were commercially available to help people suffering from Polio and other diseases to navigate stairs.

The modern movement of the 1960s produced new forms of chairs: the butterfly chair (originally called the Hardoy chair), bean bags, and the egg-shaped pod chair that turns. It also introduced the first mass-produced plastic chairs such as the Bofinger chair in 1966. Technological advances led to molded plywood and wood laminate chairs, as well as chairs made of leather or polymers. Mechanical technology incorporated into the chair enabled adjustable chairs, especially for office use. Motors embedded in the chair resulted in massage chairs.

== Materials ==

Chairs can be made from wood, metal, or other strong materials, like stone or acrylic. In some cases, multiple materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal and the seat and back may be made from plastic. Chairs may have hard surfaces of wood, metal, plastic, or other materials, or some or all of these hard surfaces may be covered with upholstery or padding. The design may be made of porous materials, or be drilled with holes for decoration; a low back or gaps can provide ventilation. The back may extend above the height of the occupant&#x27;s head, which can optionally contain a headrest. Chairs can also be made from more creative materials, such as recycled materials like cutlery and wooden play bricks, pencils, plumbing tubes, rope, corrugated cardboard, and PVC pipe.

In rare cases, chairs are made out of unusual materials, especially as a form of art or experimentation. Raimonds Cirulis, a Latvian interior designer, created a volcanic hanging chair that is handmade out of volcanic rock. Peter Brenner, a Dutch-born German designer, has created a chair made from lollipop sugar – of confectioners&#x27; sugar.

== Design and ergonomics ==
Chair design considers intended usage, ergonomics (how comfortable it is for the occupant), as well as non-ergonomic functional requirements such as size, stacking ability, folding ability, weight, durability, stain resistance, and artistic design.

===Seat height===

Ergonomic design distributes the weight of the occupant to various parts of the body. This is done by having an easily adjustable seat height. A seat that is higher results in dangling feet and increased pressure on the underside of the knees (&quot;popliteal fold&quot;). It may also result in no weight on the feet which means more weight elsewhere. A lower seat may shift too much weight to the &quot;seat bones&quot; (&quot;ischial tuberosities&quot;). Gas springs are attached to the body of the chair in order to give height adjustment and more comfort to the user.

Some chairs have foot rests. Around 15% of women and 2% of men need foot rests, even at the chair height. A stool or other simple chair may have a simple straight or curved bar near the bottom for the sitter to place their feet on.

Actual chair dimensions are determined by measurements of the human body or anthropometric measurements. The two most relevant anthropometric measurements for chair design are the popliteal height and buttock popliteal length.

For someone seated, the popliteal height is the distance from the underside of the foot to the underside of the thigh at the knees. It is sometimes called the &quot;stool height&quot;. The term &quot;sitting height&quot; is reserved for the height to the top of the head when seated. For American men, the median popliteal height is and for American women it is . The popliteal height, after adjusting for heels, clothing and other issues, is used to determine the height of the chair seat. Mass-produced chairs are typically high.

Researchers such as Mary Blade and Galen Cranz found that sitting on the edge of a high stool with feet on the floor is less harmful for the lower back than sitting up straight on a conventional chair.

===Reclining angle===

Different types of chairs can have a variety of seating positions, depending on the intended task. Typically, chairs intended for people completing work or dining can only recline very slightly (otherwise the occupant is too far away from the desk or table). Dental chairs are necessarily reclined. Research has shown that the best seated posture is a reclined posture of 100°–110°. In order to recline, the back-rest may be independently adjustable. A reclining seat and back will reduce the load on the occupant&#x27;s back muscles. In general, if the occupant is supposed to sit for a long time, weight needs to be taken off the seat area and thus &quot;easy&quot; chairs intended for long periods of sitting are generally at least slightly reclined.

===Back and head support===

The back of the chair will support some of the weight of the occupant, reducing the weight on other parts of the body. Some back-rests support only the lumbar region, while shoulder height back-rests support the entire back and shoulders. support the head as well and are important in vehicles for preventing &quot;whiplash&quot; neck injuries in rear-end collisions where the head is jerked back suddenly. Reclining chairs typically have at least shoulder-height back-rests to shift weight to the shoulders.

===Padding===
There may be cases where padding is not desirable, such as chairs that are intended primarily for outdoor use. Where padding is not desirable, contouring may be used instead. A contoured seat pan attempts to distribute weight without padding. By matching the shape of the occupant&#x27;s buttocks, weight is distributed and maximum pressure is reduced.

=== Armrests ===

A chair may or may not have armrests; chairs with armrests are termed &quot;armchairs&quot;. In French, a distinction is made between &quot;fauteuil&quot; and &quot;chaise&quot;, the terms for chairs with and without armrests, respectively. In Germany, an armchair was once called a &quot;Krankensessel&quot;, or sick-chair, because it was intended for people who were too ill to stand or sit without extra support.

If present, armrests will support part of the body weight through the arms if the arms are resting on the armrests. Elbow rest height is used to determine the height of the armrests. Armrests should support the forearm and not the sensitive elbow area. Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area. Armrests further have the function of making entry and exit from the chair easier (but from the side it becomes more difficult).

===Seat size and legroom===

For someone seated, the buttock popliteal length is the horizontal distance from the back most part of the buttocks to the back of the lower leg. This anthropometric measurement is used to determine the seat depth. Mass-produced chairs are typically deep.

Additional anthropometric measurements may be relevant to designing a chair. Hip breadth is used for chair width and armrest width. The buttock-knee length is used to determine &quot;leg room&quot; between rows of chairs. &quot;Seat pitch&quot; is the distance between rows of seats. In some airplanes and stadiums the leg room (the seat pitch less the thickness of the seat at thigh level) is so small that it is sometimes insufficient for the average person.

==Types of chairs==

A wide variety of chairs have emerged throughout the ages, some based on formal usages, and others based on domestic needs, and some based on needs within the workplace or various professions.

===Office chair===
An office chair is one used by employees within an office. Modern office chairs are usually adjustable and wheeled. Caster wheels are attached to the feet of chairs to give more mobility.

===Dining room chair===
A dining room chair is a specific type of design, used around a dining room table. It can be found in most ordinary residential homes, and also may appear in formal settings, such as any formal event or reception that includes a formal meal or banquet.

===Work chair===
A work chair is a specialized chair, adapted to the needs of a particular profession or setting. For example, a designing chair will be used for designers who sit at high easels; it will usually have added height.

===Rocking chair===
Some chairs have two curved bands of wood (also known as rockers) attached to the bottom of the legs. They are called rocking chairs.

===Kneeling chair===

A kneeling chair adds an additional body part, the knees, to support the weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of the weight of the occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body, and thus reducing the amount of pressure at any given point. By contrast, a hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight.

== Seats ==
Chair seats vary widely in construction and may or may not match construction of the chair&#x27;s back (back-rest).

Some systems include:
* Center seats where a solid material forms the chair seat
** Solid wood, may or may not be shaped to human contours
** Wood slats, often seen on outdoor chairs
** Padded leather, generally a flat wood base covered in padding and contained in soft leather
** Stuffed fabric, similar to padded leather
** Metal seats of solid or open design
** Molded plastic
** Stone, often marble
* Open center seats where a soft material is attached to the tops of chair legs or between stretchers to form the seat
** Wicker, woven to provide a surface with give to it
** Leather, may be tooled with a design
** Fabric, simple covering without support
** Tape, wide fabric tape woven into seat, seen in lawn chairs and some old chairs
** Caning,
** Rush, wrapped from rush, heavy paper, strong grasses, or hand twisted while wrapped with cattails to form the seat, usually in a pattern of four trapezoids meeting in the center, and on rare occasions, in elaborate patterns
** Reed,
** Rawhide
** Splint, ash, oak or hickory strips are woven
** Metal, Metal mesh or wire woven to form seat

== Standards and specifications ==

Design considerations for chairs have been codified into standards. ISO 9241, &quot;Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) – Part 5: Workstation layout and postural requirements&quot;, is the most common one for modern chair design.

There are multiple specific standards for different types of chairs. Dental chairs are specified by ISO 6875. Bean bag chairs are specified by ANSI standard ASTM F1912-98. ISO 7174 specifies stability of rocking and tilting chairs. ASTM F1858-98 specifies plastic lawn chairs. ASTM E1822-02b defines the combustibility of chairs when they are stacked.

The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer&#x27;s Association (BIFMA) defines ANSI/BIFMA X5.1 (titled: General-Purpose Office Chairs – Tests) for testing of commercial-grade chairs. It requires:
* chair back strength of 
* chair stability if weight is transferred completely to the front or back legs
* leg strength of applied from the bottom of the leg
* seat strength of dropped from above the seat
* seat cycle strength of 100,000 repetitions of dropped from above the seat
The specification further defines heavier &quot;proof&quot; loads that chairs must withstand. Under these higher loads, the chair may be damaged, but it must not fail catastrophically.

Large institutions that make bulk purchases will reference these standards within their own even more detailed criteria for purchase. Governments will often issue standards for purchases by government agencies (e.g. Canada&#x27;s Canadian General Standards Board CAN/CGSB 44.15M on &quot;Straight Stacking Chair, Steel&quot; or CAN/CGSB 44.232-2002 on &quot;Task Chairs for Office Work with Visual Display Terminal&quot;).

Chairs may be rated by the length of time that they may be used comfortably – an 8-hour chair, a 24-hour chair, and so on. Such chairs are specified for tasks which require extended periods of sitting, such as for receptionists or supervisors of a control panel.

== Accessories ==
In place of a built-in footrest, some chairs come with a matching ottoman. An ottoman is a short stool that is intended to be used as a footrest but can sometimes be used as a stool. If matched to a glider chair, the ottoman may be mounted on swing arms so that the ottoman rocks back and forth with the main glider.

A chair cover is a temporary fabric cover for a side chair. They are typically rented for formal events such as wedding receptions to increase the attractiveness of the chairs and decor. The chair covers may come with decorative chair ties, a ribbon to be tied as a bow behind the chair. Covers for sofas and couches are also available for homes with small children and pets. In the second half of the 20th century, some people used custom clear plastic covers for expensive sofas and chairs to protect them.

Chair pads are cushions for chairs. They contain cotton or foam for padding. Some are decorative. In cars, they may be used to increase the height of the driver. Orthopedic back-rests provide support for the back. Car seats sometimes have built-in and adjustable lumbar supports. These can also be used on kitchen chairs.

Chair mats are mats meant to cover different types of flooring. They are usually made from plastic. This allows chairs on wheels to roll easily over the carpet and protects the carpet or floor. They come in various shapes, some specifically sized to fit partially under a desk.

Remote control bags can be draped over the arm of easy chairs or sofas and used to hold remote controls for home cinemas. They are counter-weighted so as to not slide off the arms under the weight of the remote controls.

Chair glides are attached to the feet of chairs to prevent them from scratching or snagging on the floor.

An antimacassar is a cloth covering for a headrest to protect the fabric and enable easy washing.

== As sculptural and art forms ==
Christo created &quot;Wrapped Chair&quot; in 1961 with found objects (chairs), lacquer, canvas, rope, and paint. It is an early work showing his and his wife Jeanne Claude’s iconic style of partially or wholly hiding objects within wrapped cloth and ropes. Their work developed into large-scale public site-specific artworks and environmental art, which the pair are most well known for. For &quot;Wrapped Chair&quot;, Christo plays with the identity of the object by concealing parts and revealing others. There are multiple variations of this work and similar ones involving chairs displayed at museums around the world, including a similar work titled &quot;Two Wrapped Chairs&quot; from 1961.

In the same year that Christo created &quot;Wrapped Chair&quot;, Pablo Picasso also created &quot;La&quot; &quot;Chaise&quot;. Made of painted sheet metal, Picasso’s sculptural chair exemplifies what many artists love about the chair as a subject: the contrast of form and function.

&quot;One and Three Chairs&quot;, 1965, is a conceptual artwork created by Joseph Kosuth. The work is an assemblage of a manufactured chair, the photo of said chair, and the dictionary definition of the word chair. This work changes each time it is installed, since the location selects and photographs the chair for installation. A dominating part of Kosuth’s work is the impersonal aspect of all the parts since his artistic hand is not easily seen in the pre-made objects presented.
The &quot;Broken Chair&quot; is a monumental sculpture in wood, constructed of 5.5 tons of wood, high standing across the street from the Palace of Nations in Geneva. It has broken leg symbolizing opposition to land mines and cluster bombs. In 2001, Steve Mann exhibited a chair sculpture at San Francisco Art Institute. The chair had spikes that retracted when a credit card was inserted to download a seating license. Later other museums and galleries were equipped with the &quot;Pay to Sit&quot; chair, with a global central seating license server located in Toronto. The first sitting session was free, with a database of persons who had already used their free session.

In a performance piece at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Clint Eastwood addressed an empty chair, as if it represented President Barack Obama (meant to be construed as MIA or ineffectual). The address was controversial, with critics describing it as bizarre and supporters describing it as poignant. Japanese designer Tokujin Yoshioka has created several chairs as art forms such as &quot;Honey-pop&quot;: honey-comb paper chair (2001), &quot;Pane chair&quot;: natural fiber chair (2006), and &quot;Venus&quot;: natural crystal chair (2007).

New York industrial designer Ian Stell creates steel and wood kinetic sculptures that transform into chairs, including &quot;Roll Bottom Chair&quot; (2016) that turns into a secretariat desk and Loop that transforms into two interlocking chairs when expanded (2015).

== In language ==
* If someone &quot;nearly fell off their chair&quot; after being informed about something, it was because they were very shocked or surprised.
* An orchestra awards the best player in a particular section a &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;principal seat&quot; based on ability. The first chair of the section plays the solos, and in string sections, determines the bowings. In professional orchestras, the first chair player receives higher pay. It is also common for this position to be known as &quot;first stand&quot; or &quot;first desk&quot;, a reference to the portable lectern on which the musicians put their sheet music. However, the person who is first chair in the first violin section is usually referred to as the concertmaster in the US or leader in the UK.
* In academia, an endowed chair is a prestigious appointment for a professor, paid for by a dedicated funding source.
* A chair is the highest officer of an organized group, such as the chair of the board, the head of the Board of Directors in a company or non-profit organization.
* &quot;Musical chairs&quot; is a common party game, and a colloquial expression to describe people shuffling from seat to seat, around different locations, or from one job title to another.
* In American slang, to say someone will &quot;get the chair&quot; is to say that they will be executed by an electric chair. Alternatively, it can be a metaphor for other harsh punishment.

<text>Botis, sometimes Otis, is a demon described in the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (as the seventeenth spirit) and the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (as the ninth spirit) as a President and an Earl who initially appears as a viper before changing into a sword-toting, fanged, and horned human who discusses matters past, present, and future; brings favor from allies and enemies, and rules 60 legions of demons. In the &quot;Munich Manual of Demonic Magic&quot;, Botis appears as Otius, and is mostly identical except that he is a &quot;preses&quot; and Count, appears in the more humanoid form to begin with, and rules only 36 legions of demons. In the &quot;Grand Grimoire&quot;, Botis appears as a subordinate of Agaliarept. According to Rudd, Botis is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Lauviah.

<text>In demonology, Morax, also spelled Foraii, Marax, or Farax, is a Demon, Great Earl, and President of Hell, having thirty (thirty-two, according to other authors) legions of demons under his command. He teaches astronomy and all other liberal sciences, and gives good and wise familiars that know the virtues of all herbs and precious stones.

He is depicted both as a man with the head of a bull, as well as a bull with the head of a man. It has been proposed that Morax is related to the Minotaur which Dante places in Hell (&quot;Inferno&quot;, Canto xii).

His name seems to come from &quot;morax&quot;, a Latin word meaning &quot;that which delays, that which stops&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Morax is portrayed in the Japanese anime and manga series &quot;Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun&quot; as a female teacher named Morax Momonoki. Morax is also the name of the Geo Archon in 2020 video game &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, who appears as Zhongli.

<doc id="262656" wikidata="Q578680" url="?curid=262656" title="Naberius">
<text>The demon Naberius was first mentioned by Johann Weyer in 1583. He is supposedly the most valiant Marquess of Hell, and has nineteen legions of demons under his command. He makes men cunning in all arts (and sciences, according to most authors), but especially in rhetoric, speaking with a hoarse voice. He also restores lost dignities and honors, although to Johann Weyer, he procures the loss of them.

==Description==
Naberius appears as a three-headed dog or a raven. He has a raucous voice, but presents himself as eloquent and amiable. He teaches the art of gracious living. He has also been depicted as a crow or a black crane.

Concerning his name, it is unclear if there is an association with the Greek Cerberus. It is said that in 1583, Johann Weyer considers both of them to be the same demon. He claimed:

Naberius [Naberus], alias Cerberus, is a valiant marquesse, showing himself in the form of a crow, when he speaks with a hoarse voice: he makes a man amiable and cunning in all arts, and special in rhetoric, he procures the loss of prelacies and dignities: nineteen legions hear (and obey) him.
Other spellings include Cerberus, Cerbere, and Naberus.
