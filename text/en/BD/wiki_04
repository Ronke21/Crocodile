<text>Thomas Traherne (; 1636 or 1637) was an English poet, Anglican cleric, theologian, and religious writer. The intense, scholarly spirituality in his writings has led to his being commemorated by some parts of the Anglican Communion on 10 October (the anniversary of his burial in 1674) or on 27 September.

The work for which Traherne is best known today is the &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot;, a collection of short paragraphs in which he reflects on Christian life and ministry, philosophy, happiness, desire and childhood. This was first published in 1908 after having been rediscovered in manuscript ten years earlier. His poetry likewise was first published in 1903 and 1910 (&quot;The Poetical Works of Thomas Traherne, B.D.&quot; and &quot;Poems of Felicity&quot;). His prose works include &quot;Roman Forgeries&quot; (1673), &quot;Christian Ethics&quot; (1675), and &quot;A Serious and Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God&quot; (1699).

Traherne&#x27;s writings frequently explore the glory of creation and what he saw as his intimate relationship with God. His writing conveys an ardent, almost childlike love of God, and is compared to similar themes in the works of later poets William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. His love for the natural world is frequently expressed in his works by a treatment of nature that evokes Romanticism—two centuries before the Romantic movement.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Traherne&#x27;s birth and baptism are not recorded in parish registers. According to antiquarian Anthony à Wood (1632–1695), he was a &quot;shoemaker&#x27;s son of Hereford&quot; born in either 1636 or 1637. Bertram Dobell identifies this shoemaker as John Traherne (born 1566). However, other sources say that Thomas was the son of Philipp Traherne (or Trehearne) (1568–1645), a local innkeeper and twice Mayor of Hereford, and his third wife, Mary Lane.

Traherne writes about his childhood, which included a natural wonder at and appreciation of the world around him, in &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot; and in his poetry.
Traherne was educated at Hereford Cathedral School and matriculated in Brasenose College, Oxford, on 2 April 1652, receiving his baccalaureate degree on 13 October 1656. Five years later he was promoted to the degree of Master of Arts (Oxon.) on 6 November 1661, and he received a Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) on 11 December 1669.
===Church ministry===
After receiving his baccalaureate degree from Oxford in 1656, he took holy orders.

On 30 December 1657, he was appointed as the rector of Credenhill near Hereford, by the Commissioners for the Approbation of Public Preachers, although at the time he was not an ordained priest. A curious note appended to the record of his appointment is that Traherne counted upon the patronage of Ambella, the widow of the Earl of Kent. Traherne served in this post for ten years.

Following the restoration of the monarchy and the return of Charles II, Traherne was ordained priest on 20 October 1660 by the Bishop of Oxford, Robert Skinner, at Launton near Bicester.

In 1667, Traherne became the private chaplain to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal to King Charles II, at Teddington (near Hampton Court) in Middlesex. It was while residing there that Traherne died on 27 September 1674, having that day dictated a brief nuncupative will to his friend and neighbour John Berdoe, in which he made bequests to the servants who had looked after him and left his few belongings to his brother Philip and sister-in-law Susan. On 10 October 1674 he was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church at Teddington, under the church&#x27;s reading desk.

===Character and lifestyle===
Traherne was described as &quot;one of the most pious ingenious men that ever I was acquainted with&quot;, and &quot;a man of a cheerful and sprightly Temper … ready to do all good Offices to his Friends, and Charitable to the Poor almost beyond his ability&quot;. Traherne believed he suffered from the weaknesses of a sociable personality: &quot;Too much openness and proneness to Speak are my Diseas. Too easy and complying a Nature&quot;.

According to Anthony à Wood, Traherne &quot;always led a simple and devout life; his will shows that he possessed little beyond his books ...&quot;.

==Writings==
===Publication history during lifetime and soon after===
Traherne was an inconsequential literary figure during his lifetime and his works were not known or appreciated until long after his death. As a country priest he led a devout, humble life and did not participate in literary circles. Only one of his works, &quot;Roman Forgeries&quot; (1673), was published in his lifetime. &quot;Christian Ethicks&quot; (1675) followed soon after his death, and later &quot;A Serious and Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God&quot; (1699), which was published as the work of an anonymous author whose character and background were discussed in a brief introduction by the publisher.

At Traherne&#x27;s death in 1674 most of his manuscripts were bequeathed to his brother Philip. After Philip&#x27;s death they apparently passed into the possession of the Skipp family of Ledbury in Herefordshire, where they languished for almost 200 years. In 1888 the family&#x27;s assets were dissolved, yet the manuscripts did not re-emerge until 10 years later.

===Later publication history===
In the winter of 1896–97, William T. Brooke of London discovered some anonymous manuscripts in a &quot;barrow of books about to be trashed&quot; or a &quot;street bookstall&quot;. Brooke thought that they might be lost works by Henry Vaughan and showed them to Alexander Grosart (1827–99), a Scottish clergyman and expert on Elizabethan and Jacobean literature who reprinted rare works. Grosart agreed that the manuscripts were by Vaughan and planned to include them in an edition of Vaughan&#x27;s works that he was preparing for publication. Grosart died in 1899 and the proposed edition was never completed.

Grosart&#x27;s collection, including the manuscripts, was purchased by Charles Higham, a London bookseller, who asked his friend Bertram Dobell to examine them. Dobell was convinced that they were not by Vaughan and soon deduced that they were by Traherne. The manuscripts included poetry as well as a collection of contemplative paragraphs &quot;embodying reflexions on religion and morals&quot;.

&quot;The Poetical Works of Thomas Traherne&quot; was published in 1903 and &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot; in 1908. Other publications followed. Eventually the &quot;Centuries&quot; were to be described as &quot;one of the finest prose-poems in our language&quot; and passages from them were set to music almost as often as the poems.

===Manuscripts===
A Traherne manuscript of &quot;Centuries&quot;, the Dobell Folio (also called the &quot;Commonplace Book&quot;), &quot;The Church&#x27;s Year Book&quot;, and the &quot;Early Notebook&quot; (also called Philip Traherne&#x27;s Notebook) are held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford; the Burney Manuscript (also known as &quot;Poems of Felicity&quot;) is at the British Library, London; and &quot;Select Meditations&quot; is in the Osborn Collection, Beinecke Library, New Haven, Connecticut.

A manuscript discovered in 1996 in the Folger Library in Washington, D.C., by Julia Smith and Laetitia Yeandle was later identified as an unfinished 1,800-line epic poem by Traherne entitled &quot;The Ceremonial Law&quot;. In 1997 Jeremy Maule, a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, discovered more works by Traherne among 4,000 manuscripts in the Library of Lambeth Palace, the London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Lambeth manuscripts, mostly prose, encompass four complete works and a fragment of a fifth: &quot;Inducements to Retiredness&quot;, &quot;A Sober View of Dr Twisse&quot;, &quot;Seeds of Eternity&quot;, &quot;The Kingdom of God&quot; and the fragmentary &quot;Love&quot;.

==Reception of the poetry==
Although Traherne is now counted one of the leading Metaphysical poets, the name of that &quot;school&quot; went unmentioned on his first publication. In his preface to &quot;The Poetical Works&quot;, Dobell linked him with &quot;that small group of religious poets which includes Herbert, Vaughan and Crawshaw&quot;, but distinguished him as uniquely individual and &quot;neither a follower nor imitator of any of these&quot;. In the selection of his poems that followed two years later, they were accompanied in the same volume by the &#x27;verse-remains&#x27; of Henry Vaughan&#x27;s twin brother Thomas (Eugenius Philalethes) and John Norris of Bemerton. The reputation of the two latter was then and remains as philosophers. Both were also clergymen and Norris was the incumbent of Herbert&#x27;s former parsonage; it was not until much later that he was to be described also as &quot;the last of the Metaphysicals&quot;. Traherne, then, is being presented by propinquity as a representative of the line of 17th-century devotional poets rather than the member of a particular school.

At the time of publication, those writers whom Samuel Johnson had described dismissively as &quot;metaphysical poets&quot; had yet to achieve the critical prominence they were given after the appearance of Herbert Grierson&#x27;s anthology, &quot;Metaphysical Lyrics and Poems of the Seventeenth Century&quot; (1921). In any case, none of Traherne&#x27;s poems were included there and when he did come to the notice of T. S. Eliot, it was only to be put aside as &quot;more a mystic than a poet&quot;. After that, it took decades before his work was given more serious scrutiny.

Certainly, the mystical element is strikingly evident in Traherne, but his Metaphysical credentials are confirmed by the way in which he seeks to explain issues of truth, knowledge, and the faculties of the mind and heart by methods of theological and rational examination. Typical also is the way in which these meditations are worked out as extended Baroque conceits, of which &quot;Shadows in the Water&quot; is a particularly striking example. A further link with fellow devotional poets of his period is found in the idealisation of childish innocence and the use of Platonic themes which Traherne shares with Henry Vaughan and John Norris.

==Influences==

===Development of personal faith===
Given some of the autobiographical and confessional material in his works (notably in &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot;), Traherne must have suffered from a lack of faith in his formative years at Oxford. He describes this as a period of Apostasy and that he later found his way back to faith:
However, there is an alternative reading possible, which may be closer to the facts of Traherne&#x27;s experience as he expresses them in the quote above. This is that he did not suffer a loss of faith, but rather identified his maturation away from a natural, innocent child&#x27;s view of the world and his place in it, from an innate understanding of the wonder of God&#x27;s creation, to a burdened grappling with the rules and expectation of church and society as an apostasy itself, which he had to overcome then by careful and disciplined study (&quot;the highest reason&quot;). This childlike, accepting, and joyous view of faith and religious ecstasy is at the core of the writing from which the excerpt above is drawn, and is part of the reason for Traherne&#x27;s appeal.

===Neoplatonism===
Traherne is heavily influenced by the works of Neoplatonist philosophers and several of his contemporaries who were called the Cambridge Platonists. The Cambridge Platonists were latitudinarians in that they argued for moderation and dialogue between the factions of Puritans and High Churchmen in the Anglican church. They believed that religion and reason could be in harmony with one another based on a mystical understanding of reason—believing that reason rose beyond mere sense perception but was &quot;the candle of the Lord&quot; and an echo of the divine residing within the human soul. Reason was both God-given and of God.
Indeed, critic K. W. Salter notes that Traherne &quot;writes of the senses as if they were spiritual and of the spirit as if it were sensuous.&quot; However, according to Gladys Wade&#x27;s 1946 biography of Traherne, she distinguished that the Cambridge Platonists &quot;wasted their energies on Hermetic and Cabalistic and Rosicrucian lore, and on incredible experiments in magic and necromancy,&quot; and remarked that Traherne&#x27;s mysticism was &quot;perfectly free from any taint of this.&quot;

==Theology and ethical themes==
===Defence of Anglican and criticism of Catholic churches===
Traherne was also concerned with the stability of the Christian church in England during the period of the Restoration. In some of his theological writings, Traherne exhibits a passion for the Anglican faith and the national church that is evident in his confrontations with Roman Catholicism and Nonconformism during this time of political and religious upheaval. The recent discoveries of previously unknown manuscripts further establish Traherne&#x27;s reputation as an Anglican divine and his works offer fresh and comprehensive insight on ongoing theological arguments regarding the nature of divinity, ethics and morality, and the nature of sin.

For instance, Traherne passionately critiques Roman Catholicism in &quot;Roman Forgeries&quot; (1673)—the only work published during his lifetime. It is a polemical treatise in the form of a dialogue between two men—a Protestant and a Roman Catholic. Relying on the Scriptures and the pronouncements of the First Council of Nicaea to formulate the idea of a legitimate church authority, Traherne criticises the state of the contemporary Catholic Church and claims through a conspiracy theory that because the Vatican has had control over the manuscripts that the Catholic Church was in a position to corrupt, misuse or suppress documents to support its claim to authority. The abusive nature of the narrator&#x27;s critique of the Church of Rome is in sharp contrast to the tenor of Traherne&#x27;s poetry or his other writings on theological topics.

However, Traherne takes a less polemic tone in the posthumously published &quot;Christian Ethicks&quot; (1675) in which he explores theological implications of Calvinist 
thought on freedom and necessity. In this work, Traherne refuses to define ethics as a secular phenomenon—instead pointing to a firm reliance on the will of God. Because of human limitations and failings, one cannot build a suitable and coherent moral system of beliefs—those virtues must derive from a divine source and their reward from perceiving the infinite love of God at the root of all things.

===Sin===
Traherne dedicated considerable examination to the subject of sin and its place vis-a-vis the church doctrines. In the recently discovered work, &quot;A Sober View of Dr Twisse&quot;, Traherne discusses sin and salvation within the frame of a larger discussion of questions of election and reprobation. Traherne writes:
===Mysticism and divine union===
Traherne&#x27;s works are inherently mystical in that they seek to understand and embrace the nature of God within his creation and within man&#x27;s soul. Traherne seems to describe his own journey of faith in &quot;Centuries of Meditation&quot;, which was likely written when Traherne was at Credenhill—a work that is noted for its &quot;spiritual intensity,&quot; and &quot;the wide scope of the writer&#x27;s survey&quot; which includes &quot;all heaven and earth he takes for the province of the pious soul&quot;. Traherne&#x27;s work is said to look &quot;upon the hidden things of the soul, and, in them, he sees the image of the glory and love of God&quot; and &quot;the eternal theme of the goodness and the splendour of God.&quot;

Traherne&#x27;s poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature.

Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).

===Felicity===
At the core of Traherne&#x27;s work is the concept of &quot;felicity&quot;, that highest state of bliss in which he describes the essence of God as a source of &quot;Delights of inestimable value.&quot;

Traherne says that &#x27;understanding set in him&#x27; secured his felicity. He argues that man can experience this felicity only by understanding the will of God and divine love and he describes the beauty of this in childlike terms. Traherne seeks to explain the &quot;Principle of Nature&quot; in which through his inclination to love truth (&quot;Light&quot;) and beauty seek him to identify felicity as its source and a natural experience.

==Other themes==

===Nature===
Another great passion that is depicted in Traherne&#x27;s work is his love of nature and the natural world, frequently displayed in a very Romantic treatment of nature that has been described as characteristically pantheist or panentheist. While Traherne credits a divine source for its creation, his praise of nature seems nothing less than what one would expect to find in Thoreau. Many scholars consider Traherne a writer of the sublime, and in his writing he seems to have tried to reclaim the lost appreciation for the natural world, as well as paying tribute to what he knew of in nature that was more powerful than he was. In this sense Traherne seems to have anticipated the Romantic movement more than 130 years before it actually occurred. There is frequent discussion of man&#x27;s almost symbiotic relationship with nature, as well as frequent use of &quot;literal setting&quot;, that is, an attempt to faithfully reproduce a sense experience from a given moment, a technique later used frequently by William Wordsworth.

===Childlike joy and attitude===

In the spirit of the gospels, Traherne&#x27;s &quot;great theme is the visionary innocence of childhood,&quot; and his writings suggest &quot;that adults have lost the joy of childhood, and with it an understanding of the divine nature of creation.&quot; Traherne seems to convey the idea that paradise can be rediscovered and regained only through reacquiring this childlike innocence—a state which &quot;precedes the knowledge of good and evil&quot; and seems to be composed of a boundless love and wonder.

In this respect, Traherne&#x27;s work is often compared to the abounding joy and mysticism found in the works of William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne&#x27;s introduction of a child&#x27;s viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time.

===Happiness===
Achieving happiness is another focus of Traherne&#x27;s work. He wrote &quot;I will first spend a great deal of time in seeking Happiness, and then a great deal more in enjoying it.&quot; He wrote that many people despise happiness, but that &quot;Heaven is a place where our happiness shall be seen of all. We shall there enjoy the happiness of being seen in happiness, without the danger of ostentation.&quot;

===Practical philosophy===
Traherne was intent that insights gained through philosophy be used in daily life.

==Legacy==
Traherne&#x27;s works remained largely unpublished until their publication at the start of the 20th century. Those who have acknowledged an influence since then have been the Trappist monk Thomas Merton; the Christian humanist Dorothy L. Sayers; the poet Elizabeth Jennings; and C. S. Lewis, who called &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot; &quot;almost the most beautiful book in English&quot;.
They also had their influence within the Anglican Communion which, though it does not create saints in the same way as in the Roman Catholic tradition, has frequently canonised people of great holiness, sometimes by a formal process and sometimes by popular acclamation or local custom. Following this precedent, and in commemoration of his poems and spiritual writings, Thomas Traherne is included in the Calendar of Saints in many national churches within the Anglican Communion. He is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration.

The commemoration of Traherne is held on either 27 September (the date of his death) or 10 October (the date of his burial).

==A century of musical settings==
It has been observed of Traherne that &quot;more than any other form of art, if one may judge from the frequency and fervor of the references, Traherne loved music&quot;, that this was of long standing and life-long. The Traherne Association has compiled a check list of some hundred composers who have recognised the lyrical power of his writing and set words by him to music. Several of these are from the poet&#x27;s native Herefordshire, while a significant proportion come from other countries and not all from the English-speaking world. There have also been a wide variety of musical styles over the past century, from art song to devotional motets, from advanced modernism to minimalism, and there have been some purely instrumental interpretations as well.

===Britain===
The earliest known setting was by Welsh-born Bryceson Treharne (1879–1948). His &quot;Invocation&quot; of 1917 was stanza 11 of an untitled poem in Traherne&#x27;s &quot;Christian Ethicks&quot;: &quot;O holy Jesus who didst for us die&quot;, set for baritone and piano. It was followed in 1924 by Rutland Boughton&#x27;s &quot;Contentment&quot;, a part-song for unaccompanied men&#x27;s voices which sets Traherne&#x27;s &quot;Contentment is a sleepy thing&quot;, also from &quot;Christian Ethicks&quot;. Later composers set both verse and prose for singing within the same work, of which one example from 1978 was Elizabeth Maconchy&#x27;s cycle &quot;Sun, Moon and Stars&quot; for soprano and piano.

It was in the 1920s that Gerald Finzi began work on his ambitious &quot;Dies natalis&quot;, a cantata for high solo voice and string orchestra. Only completed in 1939, the work&#x27;s premiere was cancelled due to the outbreak of the Second World War, and it was not performed until some months later in January 1940. Its purely instrumental &quot;Intrada&quot; is followed by a section of prose passages from the third in his &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot;, and then by three poems: &quot;The Rapture&quot;, &quot;Wonder&quot; and &quot;The Salutation&quot;. The texts chosen reflect the joy and wonder of a newborn child&#x27;s innocent perspective and wonderment at a world of such beauty.

Given Traherne&#x27;s calling and piety, many modern settings of Traherne&#x27;s work have a devotional context. His poem &quot;The Rapture&quot; was included in the &quot;Cambridge Hymnal&quot; (1967) as Hymn 97, with music by the composer William Wordsworth. Also among the largely sacred choral music of Patrick Larley has been his &quot;On Christmas Day&quot; (2002), a sequence of seven pieces, of which numbers 1, 3 and 7 incorporate verses from Traherne&#x27;s poem &quot;On Christmas-Day&quot;. Several other pieces were commissioned for special occasions: from Colin Matthews (&quot;Shadows in the water&quot;, 1978/9); Francis Jackson (&quot;On Christmas Day&quot;, 1995); John Casken (&quot;A song of Chimes&quot;, 1996); Andrew Carter (&quot;The saints of God&quot;, 2005); Cecilia McDowall, (&quot;The skies in their magnificence&quot;, 2008); Francis Pott, (&quot;The love of God is in eternity&quot;, 2011); and David Sawer, (&quot;Wonder&quot;, 2012).

===International===
Sawer&#x27;s choral work was written to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Earlier, Toivo Tulev (born 1958) had set lines from Traherne&#x27;s &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot; as &quot;Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!&quot; for a performance in honour of the queen&#x27;s state visit to Estonia in October, 2006. Other settings of Traherne&#x27;s work have been made by Bulgarian-born Dobrinka Tabakova (&quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot;, selections set for full choir, harp or piano and strings, 2012); by the French Claude Ballif, (&quot;Poème de la félicité&quot; for three female voices, 1977); and by the Finnish Jouni Kaipainen, whose &quot;Felicity and Fullnesse&quot; is described as a monodrama for high baritone and orchestra in which verses by Traherne alternate with verses by Hanno Eskola (2006).

In North America, the Canadian composer Frederick Karam (1926–1978) wrote &quot;From Dust I Rise&quot;, an anthem based on lines from Traherne&#x27;s poem &quot;The Salutation&quot;, first performed in 1958. In the United States, Anthony Piccolo wrote &quot;Wonder&quot;, with lyrics from Traherne&#x27;s poem of the same title, for medium-high voice and piano in 1987; Aaron Jay Kernis set the song cycle &quot;Two Awakenings and a Lullaby&quot; for soprano, violin, guitar and piano in 2006; Bob Chilcott set &quot;The sun and stars are mine&quot; for high voices and piano in 2012; and Garrett George composed &quot;4 Traherne Songs&quot; for soprano with piano accompaniment in 2018.

===Instrumental and other formats===
Two Japanese works by Satoru Ikeda (born 1961) have taken their beginning from Traherne&#x27;s &quot;The Salutation&quot;. The first was a vocalic transposition of the English text for chamber choir, accordion, tuba and harp, in which the instruments &quot;are symbols of Heaven, Earth, and Man&quot; (2003). Later the composer wrote a purely instrumental work for alto flute which was divided into three movements (Abyss, Awakening and Apparition), inspired by three stanzas from the poem (2015). Another interpretation of Traherne for full orchestra was Australian composer Nigel Butterley&#x27;s &quot;Meditations of Thomas Traherne&quot; (1968), based on five prose meditations.

Two organ works have been inspired by Tom Denny&#x27;s Traherne windows in the Audley chapel in Hereford Cathedral. In addition, American Peter Stoltzfus Berton (born 1968) based the fifteen pieces in his &quot;Hereford Variations&quot; (2007) on Traherne&#x27;s &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot;. Martin Bussey&#x27;s organ work &quot;Hereford Windows&quot; followed in 2014.

Traherne&#x27;s writing has also contributed to two larger-scale works. Kenneth Leighton&#x27;s Symphony No.2 (Sinfonia mistica, 1974) set lines from Traherne&#x27;s &quot;Thanksgivings for the Body&quot; as its third movement (Meditation). Later, Harrison Birtwistle had Christ quote from &quot;Thanksgivings for the Body&quot; in Vision 1 of his opera &quot;The Last Supper&quot; (1999).

Lying outside the classical music tradition, the Incredible String Band&#x27;s piece &quot;Douglas Traherne Harding&quot; on the &quot;Wee Tam and the Big Huge&quot; album (1968) incorporated lines from &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot; and demonstrates the wide versatility of application of which Traherne&#x27;s work has been capable.

<text>Robert Herrick (baptised 24 August 1591 – buried 15 October 1674) was a 17th-century English lyric poet and Anglican cleric. He is best known for &quot;Hesperides&quot;, a book of poems. This includes the &quot;carpe diem&quot; poem &quot;To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time&quot;, with the first line &quot;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Cheapside, London, Robert Herrick was the seventh child and fourth son of Julia Stone and Nicholas Herrick, a prosperous goldsmith. He was named after an uncle, Robert Herrick (or Heyrick), a prosperous Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester, who had bought the land Greyfriars Abbey stood on after Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution in the mid-16th century. Nicholas Herrick died in a fall from a fourth-floor window in November 1592, when Robert was a year old (whether this was suicide remains unclear). 

The tradition that Herrick received his education at Westminster is based on the words &quot;beloved Westminster&quot; in his poem &quot;Tears to Thamesis&quot;, but the allusion is to the city, not the school. It is more likely that he, like his uncle&#x27;s children, attended The Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. In 1607 he became apprenticed to his other uncle, Sir William Herrick, a goldsmith and jeweller to the king. The apprenticeship ended after only six years, when Herrick, aged 22, gained admission at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He later migrated to Trinity Hall, graduating in 1617. Herrick became a member of the Sons of Ben, a group centred on an admiration for the works of Ben Jonson, to whom he wrote at least five poems. Herrick was ordained into the Church of England in 1623 and in 1629 became the vicar of Dean Prior in Devonshire.

==Civil War==
In 1647, in the wake of the English Civil War, Herrick was ejected from his vicarage for refusing the Solemn League and Covenant. He returned to London to live in Westminster and depend on the charity of his friends and family. He spent some time preparing his lyric poems for publication and had them printed in 1648 under the title &quot;Hesperides; or the Works both Human and Divine of Robert Herrick&quot;, with a dedication to the Prince of Wales.

==Restoration and later life==
When King Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, Herrick petitioned for his own restoration to his living. He had obtained favour by writing verses celebrating the births of both Charles II and his brother James before the Civil War. Herrick became the vicar of Dean Prior again in the summer of 1662 and lived there until his death in October 1674, at the age of 83. His date of death is unknown, but he was buried on 15 October.

Herrick was a bachelor all his life. Many of the women he names in his poems are thought to be fictional.

==Poetic style and stature==
Herrick wrote over 2,500 poems, about half of which appear in his major work, &quot;Hesperides&quot;. &quot;Hesperides&quot; also includes the much shorter &quot;Noble Numbers&quot;, his first book of spiritual works, first published in 1648. He is well known for his style, and in his earlier works for frequent references to lovemaking and the female body. His later poetry was of a more spiritual and philosophical nature. Among his most famous short poetical sayings are the unique monometers, such as number 475, &quot;Thus I / Pass by / And die,/ As one / Unknown / And gone.&quot;

Herrick sets out his subject-matter in the poem he printed at the beginning of his collection, &quot;The Argument of his Book&quot;. He dealt with English country life and its seasons, village customs, complimentary poems to various ladies and his friends, themes taken from classical writings, and a solid bedrock of Christian faith, not intellectualized but underpinning the rest. It has been said of Herrick&#x27;s style that &quot;his directness of speech with clear and simple presentation of thought, a fine artist working with conscious knowledge of his art, of an England of his youth in which he lives and moves and loves, clearly assigns him to the first place as a lyrical poet in the strict and pure sense of the phrase.&quot;

Herrick never married and none of his love poems seems to connect directly with any one woman. He loved the richness of sensuality and the variety of life. This appears vividly in such poems as &quot;Cherry-ripe&quot;, &quot;Delight in Disorder&quot; and &quot;Upon Julia&#x27;s Clothes&quot;.

The overriding message in Herrick&#x27;s work is that life is short, the world beautiful and love splendid. We must use the short time we have to make the most of it. This message is clear in &quot;To the Virgins, to make much of Time&quot;, &quot;To Daffodils&quot;, &quot;To Blossoms&quot; and &quot;Corinna&#x27;s Going A Maying&quot;, where the warmth and exuberance of a seemingly kind and jovial personality comes over.
The opening stanza in one of his more famous poems, &quot;To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time&quot;, runs:
This is an example of the carpe diem genre, whose popularity Herrick&#x27;s poems helped to revive.

His poems were none too popular on publication. A style influenced by Ben Jonson, the classical Roman writers and the late Elizabethan era must have seemed old-fashioned to an audience tuned to the complexities of metaphysical poets such as John Donne and Andrew Marvell. His work was rediscovered in the early 19th century and has been regularly printed since.

The Victorian poet Swinburne described Herrick as &quot;the greatest song writer ever born of English race&quot;. Despite his use of classical allusions and names, Herrick&#x27;s poems are easier for modern readers than those of many of his contemporaries.

==In literature==
Herrick appears in James Branch Cabell&#x27;s &quot;Concerning Corrina&quot;, published in his 1916 short-story volume &quot;The Certain Hour: Dizain des Poëtes&quot;. The story strongly suggests that the poet was an adept of the dark arts. Though technically a mystery or horror story, it is best classed as a philosophical comedy.

Herrick is a major character in Rose Macaulay&#x27;s 1932 historical novel &quot;They Were Defeated&quot;.

Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Happy Days&quot; has the character Winnie quote from Herrick&#x27;s &quot;To the Virgins to Make Much of Time&quot;.

Ken Bruen in his debut novel &quot;Rilke on Black&quot; makes Herrick&#x27;s two-line poem &quot;Dreams&quot; a favorite with the protagonist Nick. Robert Herrick is one of many historical characters in the alternate history series &quot;1632&quot;. The dedication in Thomas Burnett Swann&#x27;s Will-o-the-Wisp (1976, ) is &quot;A novel suggested by the life of Robert Herrick, poet, vicar, and pagan&quot;. Herrick was referred to by the character Clement in HBO&#x27;s &#x27;Industry&#x27; (December 2020), in view of a candle on a birthday cake representing the passing of precious time.

==In music==
The first composers to set Herrick to music were near-contemporaries: at least 40 settings of 31 poems appear in the extant manuscript and printed songbooks of 1624–1683, by Henry and William Lawes, John Wilson, Robert Ramsey and others. It is clear from references within &quot;Hesperides&quot; that many other settings have not survived. 

From the early 20th century, Herrick&#x27;s verse became popular with a range of composers. One of them, Fritz Hart, was by far the most prolific, with more than 120 settings composed throughout his life, mostly collected in &quot;Fourteen Songs&quot;, op. 10 (1912), &quot;Twenty-One Songs&quot;, op. 23 (1916), &quot;Twenty Five Songs&quot; in five sets, opp. 50–54 (1922), &quot;Nine Sets of Four Songs Each&quot;, opp. 82–90 (1930), &quot;Three Sets of Five Songs&quot;, opp. 148–150 (1941), and &quot;Two Sets of Five Songs&quot;, opp. 166–167 (1948).

<text>Pendleton Murrah (January 1, 1824August 4, 1865) was the tenth Governor of Texas. His term in office coincided with the American Civil War.

==Career==
Murrah&#x27;s birth date and birth location vary from source to source. Some have him born in 1824; others give his birth year as 1826. According to his 1850 and 1860 entries in the U.S. Census, Murrah was a native of Alabama. His birthplace is sometimes listed as South Carolina, but more recent sources indicate he was born in Bibb County and was the illegitimate son of Peggy Murrah, a daughter of Charles and Avarilla Jones Murrah. He was raised and educated in a Baptist orphanage, and graduated from Brown University in 1848. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar. He moved to Texas and opened a law practice in Marshall.

After losing a race in 1855, Murrah won election to the Texas House of Representatives in 1857, and also served on the executive committee of the Texas Democratic Party. In 1861 he declined to run for a seat in the Confederate Congress because of ill health, probably tuberculosis, but his health recovered sufficiently that he accepted a commission in the 14th Texas Infantry, a Confederate Army unit commanded by former governor Edward Clark. Murrah soon resigned his commission, but he won the gubernatorial election in 1863, and served until the fall of the Confederacy.

As governor during the American Civil War, Murrah emphatically supported the Confederate cause, although he ended up in a controversy over the conscription of Texas militia troops into the Confederate Army. Still, even after Robert E. Lee surrendered in 1865, he encouraged Texans to continue the fight.

When he learned that Union Army forces were en route to Texas, Murrah fled to Mexico with other Confederate leaders. Lieutenant Governor Fletcher Summerfield Stockdale filled the vacant post, acting as governor for five days, until provisional governor Andrew J. Hamilton assumed office in August 1865.

The trip to Mexico took a toll on Murrah&#x27;s health, and he died in Monterrey on August 4, 1865. His grave is located in the Panteon Municipal of Monterrey, Mexico.

Charles Murrah, the grandfather of Pendleton Murrah, was born in 1775 in Warren County, North Carolina. He traced his ancestry through his parents Charles and his Margaret (Peggy) Murrah, and through them to his grandparents Lodowick and Mira Ann Jeter Murrah of Caroline County, Virginia.

In 1850 Murrah married Sue Ellen Taylor, daughter of a prominent Texas plantation owner. According to the 1860 census, they had no children.

<doc id="255704" wikidata="Q1221042" url="?curid=255704" title="Mere, Wiltshire">
<text>Mere is a market town and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. It lies at the extreme southwestern tip of Salisbury Plain, close to the borders of Somerset and Dorset. The parish includes the hamlets of Barrow Street, Burton, Charnage, Limpers Hill, Rook Street and Southbrook.

The A303 trunk road passed through Mere until a bypass was built on the northern edge of the town in 1976.

There is an old market square (although markets have not been held for several years), a chiming town clock and a large 15th-century parish church. The steep slope of Castle Hill rises from the northwestern side of Mere. Local industry and commerce includes a trout farm and smokery, Yapp&#x27;s wine merchants, Charles Farris candlemakers, the Hillbrush brushmaking company, and large wholesale plant nurseries.

==History==
Evidence of prehistoric activity in the area is provided by bowl barrows, including four on Long Hill, overlooking the town. On the northwestern boundary of the parish is Whitesheet Hill, with barrows and an Iron Age hill fort, White Sheet camp. A burial dating from either the 7th or 8th has been found in the town.

Mere had a church from the end of the 12th century. The Earl of Cornwall built Mere Castle on a hill which is connected to Long Hill, overlooking the town, in the mid-13th century. The castle was abandoned in the 14th century and today only earthworks remain. The Duchy of Cornwall still owns much land in the area.

Mere Down, north of the town, has medieval strip lynchets.

== Governance ==
The civil parish elects a town council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs most significant local government functions.

An electoral ward with the same name exists. The ward starts in the east at West Knoyle, stretches through Mere, continues to Zeals and finishes in the northwest at Kilmington. The population of the ward taken from the 2011 census was 4,285.

== Religious sites ==
=== Parish church ===
The Anglican church of St Michael the Archangel is from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, and contains remnants from an earlier building. Pevsner describes the church and its furnishings in considerable detail. The church has a tower with eight bells and is unusual in that it has 10 misericords; those on the south side of the choir date from the 15th century, whilst those on the north side are early 20th century. Restoration in 1856 was by T.H. Wyatt. In 1966 the church was designated as Grade I listed.

The benefice was combined with West Knoyle in 1929, and Maiden Bradley in 1976, forming the parish of Mere with West Knoyle and Maiden Bradley.

=== Others ===
Mere Methodist Church was built as a Primitive Methodist chapel in 1846; a gallery was added in 1859 and a schoolroom in 1874. It was de-consecrated in 2017 and sold at auction in April 2018. It has been converted for residential use.

Mere United Reformed Church was built in 1868 as a Congregational chapel, joining the United Reformed Church at its formation in 1972. Precursors of the present building were a small Presbyterian chapel of 1700, an Independent chapel of 1795 and a larger chapel of 1852.

The church of St Matthew was built in 1882 by C.E. Ponting, on a rural site at White Hill, southeast of the town. It was a mission church, served by the clergy of St Michael&#x27;s. The church closed in 2004 and was sold for residential use in 2008.

St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic church was built in 1946 after the community purchased a surplus Nissen hut.

== Notable buildings ==
Woodlands Manor, south of the town, is a Grade I listed manor house and chapel from the 14th century, which was restored to its 17th-century appearance in the 20th century.

Buildings designated as Grade II* are the Old Ship Hotel, formerly a house dated 1711, later the Ship Inn; the Chantry, a 15th-century house for chantry priests; and Dewes House, 17th century.

== Schools ==
The town has a primary school. The local secondary school is Gillingham School, Dorset, about away.

The present school was opened in 1965 at a new site, on Duchy of Cornwall land, as Duchy Manor Secondary School. Accommodation for younger children was added on the same site in 1992 and in 2004 the whole premises became the primary school. Earlier schools were, firstly, the British School, founded c. 1830 and from 1852 housed in the schoolroom under the new Congregational chapel, later taking over the whole building when the larger adjacent chapel was built in 1868. Secondly, the National School, opened near St Michael&#x27;s in 1840, extended 1864, and augmented in 1899 by the adjacent Grove Building which was funded by Miss Julia Chafyn Grove of Zeals House. The schools amalgamated in 1922 and continued on the same sites as Mere First School (until 1992) and Mere Senior School, later Junior School (until 1972).

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wiltshire, BBC Radio Solent can also be heard in the town, Heart West, Vale FM, and Alfred Radio, a community based station which broadcast from Shaftesbury. The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Warminster Journal&quot; and &quot;Wiltshire Times&quot;.

==Amenities==
The town&#x27;s library and museum are housed in the 1839 National School building, which was converted in 1970.

The town centre has three pubs, the George Inn and the Butt of Sherry. The Walnut Tree Inn is towards the south of the town.

The Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance recreational footpath passes through the town. The town is part of the West Country Carnival circuit.

The nearest railway station is in neighbouring Gillingham, Dorset, on the Exeter to Waterloo line.

==Notable people==
*Sir Harrison Birtwistle (1934–2022), composer
*Edward Henslow (1879–1947), British Army officer and first-class cricketer
*Lot Long (sometimes Longyear) (1823–1893), thatcher, whose photograph is on the cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;

<text>Arthur Murphy (27 December 1727 – 18 June 1805), also known by the pseudonym Charles Ranger, was an Irish writer and barrister. He established himself in London as a leading playwright.

==Biography==
Murphy was born at Cloonyquin, County Roscommon, Ireland, the son of Richard Murphy and Jane French.

He studied at the Jesuit-run College of Saint-Omer, France, and was a gifted student of the Latin and Greek classics.

He worked as an actor in the theatre, became a barrister, a journalist and finally a (not very original) playwright. He edited &quot;Gray&#x27;s Inn Journal&quot; between 1752 and 1754. As Henry Thrale&#x27;s oldest and dearest friend, he introduced Samuel Johnson to the Thrales in January 1765. No. 16 Hammersmith Terrace was built for him in 1775. He was appointed Commissioner of Bankruptcy in 1803. But his own debts caught up with him and he was forced to sell the house and part of his library. He died on 18 June 1805 at his new home, 14 Queen&#x27;s Row, Knightsbridge and was buried in Hammersmith.

Murphy is known for his translations of Tacitus in 1793. They were reprinted in the Family Classical Library (A. J. Valpy, 1830-1834) and were still published in 1922. He also wrote three biographies: his 1792 &quot;An Essay on the Life and Genius of Samuel Johnson&quot;, his 1762 &quot;Fielding&#x27;s Works&quot; and his 1801 &quot;Life of David Garrick&quot;.

Murphy is thought to have coined the legal term &quot;wilful misconstruction&quot; whilst representing the &quot;Donaldson v. Becket&quot; appeal to the House of Lords in 1774 against the perpetual possession of copyright.

Arthur Murphy was devoted to Ann Elliot and he missed her after her early death. After Arthur Murphy&#x27;s death this relationship was written about by Fanny Burney who found Murphy&#x27;s devotion to Elliot fascinating.

A biography was written in 1811 by Dr. Jesse Foot. Nathaniel Dance painted his portrait which is thought to now be in the Irish National Portrait Collection.

His elder brother was known as James Murphy French, using his mother&#x27;s surname. He lived in London with his brother.

==Murphy&#x27;s drama==
An example of Murphy&#x27;s theatrical writings is &quot;The Citizen&quot;, a farce, first produced at Drury Lane in 1761. The play included Ann Elliot as Maria. Ann was Murphy&#x27;s protege and mistress.

Philpot, a wealthy skinflint, has bargained with Sir Jasper Wilding, a fox hunter, for his son Young Philpot, a buck and wastrel, to marry Maria Wilding, and for his daughter Sally to marry Wilding&#x27;s son, for settlements and twenty thousand pounds paid to Sir Jasper. Young Philpot has lost a fortune, but borrows money from his father and embarks on an insurance fraud involving shipwrecked goods. Maria plans to marry Beaufort, who loves her. As Young Philpot tries to propose, she convinces him she is half-witted, and he spurns her. In the second act, Philpot senior is visiting Corinna, a lady of loose virtue, but hides under the table when his son calls upon her. He overhears as Young Philpot tells her how he has cajoled the money out of his father. Maria&#x27;s brother surprises them, and old Philpot is also discovered, to their mutual shame. In the final scene Sir Jasper with a lawyer obtains Philpot&#x27;s signature to the agreements, but meanwhile Maria, an educated girl, shows her strong character to Young Philpot and he again refuses to propose. Having signed away his rights old Philpot offers to marry her, but the lawyer reveals himself as Beaufort, and explains that he has swapped the deeds, so that Philpot has unwittingly signed his agreement for Maria to marry Beaufort.

<text>The National Rugby League (known as the NRL Telstra Premiership due to sponsorship) is a professional rugby league competition in Australasia which contains clubs from New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand.

Tracing its origins back to the New South Wales Rugby League, which formed in 1908, rugby league competition in Australia had gone through numerous iterations, including the 1990s Super League war, by the time the NRL formed in 1998 as a joint partnership between the Australian Rugby League (ARL) and the News Corporation-controlled Super League. The partnership was dissolved in 2012, with control of the NRL going to the re-constituted ARL, which was re-structured with an independent board of directors and renamed the Australian Rugby League Commission.

The season typically runs from March to October, with each team playing 24 matches. The first-placed team at the end of the regular season awarded the minor premiership. This is followed by a finals series contested between the eight highest-placed teams from the regular season. The season culminates in the premiership-deciding grand final. The winners compete in the World Club Challenge against the champions of the English Super League. The reigning premiers are the Penrith Panthers, having won their sixth premiership, and fourth consecutive, in 2024.
==History==

=== Origin and establishment ===
The New South Wales Rugby League ran the major rugby league competition of New South Wales from its inception in 1908 until 1994. Following the introduction of a new format for interstate rugby league, the State of Origin series in 1980, the decade of the 1980s brought about expansion of the NSWRL premiership, with the introduction of commercial sponsorship, the Winfield Cup, and the addition of non-Sydney-based teams, Canberra and Illawarra in 1982. Although this move brought more interest in the competition statewide in New South Wales, it would spell the beginning of the demise of some of the traditional Sydney-based clubs as well as having a negative effect on the Brisbane Rugby League premiership. Following the 1983 season, Sydney foundation club Newtown Jets were ultimately forced to withdraw from the competition because of financial difficulties.

Further expansion of the league followed in 1988, with another three teams based outside Sydney introduced to the competition; the Newcastle Knights and the first two Queensland teams, the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast-Tweed Giants. The Brisbane and Newcastle sides proved to be successful and popular and paved the way towards a push for a truly national competition.

This was attempted in 1995 with control of the premiership passing from the NSWRFL to the Australian Rugby League (ARL), who invited four more teams from outside NSW to participate in 1995. Ultimately this competition failed, but in its demise the National Rugby League was born, incorporating the traditional Sydney clubs, successfully coompelling the Sydney market to follow the newly created national competition.
The prospect of a truly national rugby league competition in addition to the introduction of pay television in Australia attracted the attention of global media organisation, News Corporation, and it followed that professional rugby league was shaken to its very foundations in the mid-1990s with the advent of the Super League war. Initially a conflict over broadcasting rights, it became a dispute as to who controlled the sport and which traditional clubs would survive into the new national era, as News Limited formed their own Super League and admitted some former ARL clubs, poaching players from the original ARL league with high salaries. With twenty-two teams of highly varying quality playing in two competitions that year, crowd attendances and corporate sponsorships were spread very thinly, and many teams found themselves in financial difficulty. The ARL undertook moves to invite the traditional clubs that had moved to the Super League competition back into a re-unified competition. Following a period of negotiation with News Corporation, on 23 September 1997 the ARL announced that it was forming a new company to conduct the competition in 1998. On 7 October News&#x27; Manaaki Ranginui announced that he was confident that there would be a single competition in 1998. On 19 December, representatives of clubs affiliated with the Australian Rugby League gathered at the Sydney Football Stadium to decide whether to accept News Limited&#x27;s offer of a settlement – eventually voting in favour by 36 votes to 4. As a result, in the following months the National Rugby League, jointly owned by the ARL and News Limited, was formed.

It was announced that the inaugural National Rugby League (NRL) season of 1998 would have 20 teams competing, 19 remaining Super League and ARL teams plus the Melbourne Storm, who were created by Super League for their 1998 season. Clubs on both sides of the war were shut down. Super League decided to close the Hunter Mariners and the financially ruined Perth Reds, who were $10 million in debt at the end of 1997, while the ARL decided to close down the South Queensland Crushers, who were also in severe financial trouble. Additionally, at the end of 1998 the NRL decided to close down former Super League club, the Adelaide Rams and former ARL club, the Gold Coast Chargers, despite the Gold Coast franchise being one of the few clubs to make a profit during the Super League war.

===1998–2002: Rationalisation===
One condition of the peace agreement between the ARL and News Limited was that there would be a 14-team competition in 2000. The 20 clubs that played in 1998 would be assessed on various items such as sponsorship, crowds, on-field success and the like. It was also announced that clubs that merged would receive a large sum of money, as well as a guaranteed position in the 2000 NRL Competition. The St. George Dragons and the Illawarra Steelers were the first clubs to take up the offer, forming the joint-venture St. George Illawarra Dragons at the end of the 1998 season.

The 1999 Grand Final brought about a new official world record attendance for a game of rugby league. 107,999 spectators saw the Melbourne Storm defeat the newly created St. George Illawarra Dragons in the decider at Stadium Australia.

Balmain and Western Suburbs formed the joint-venture club, the Wests Tigers at the end of 1999, while North Sydney and Manly Warringah created the ill-fated Northern Eagles. As part of another image makeover, a number of teams also released new club logos. The most notable of these was the Sydney Roosters, dropping the &quot;City&quot; section of their name for the 2000 season and beyond. Souths were controversially axed from the competition at the end of 1999 for failing to meet the criteria.

This move was highly controversial and on 12 November 2000 about 80,000 marched in protest at their continued exclusion. South Sydney challenged the decision in the Federal Court claiming that the NRL agreement was exclusionary, intended to unfairly exclude South Sydney, and breached the Trade Practices Act. Justice Paul Finn ruled that the agreement did not specifically exclude any club and dismissed the Rabbitohs&#x27; claims for re-instatement into the national competition. Souths appealed this decision and were re-admitted into the competition in 2002.

The Auckland Warriors experienced much financial hardship in the early part of the decade, ultimately collapsing before being resurrected as the New Zealand Warriors for the 2001 season. They made the grand final in 2002 and then again in 2011, losing both encounters to the Sydney Roosters and the re-instated Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, respectively.

In 2001, Australia&#x27;s largest telecommunications provider Telstra became naming rights sponsor of the NRL, with the competition&#x27;s name becoming the NRL Telstra Premiership, while in 2002 David Gallop took over the CEO role from David Moffett, and the competition has become more and more popular each season.

In 2001 the NRL Grand Final started to be played on Sunday nights, a shift from the traditional Sunday afternoon slot used for over a decade prior.

=== 2003–2010: Record popularity, expansion and centenary ===
The 2003 season was widely regarded as the most successful since the beginning of the National Rugby League in 1998. The Manly Warringah Rugby League Football Club took over the NRL licence from the Northern Eagles franchise, after the financial bankruptcy of the North Sydney faction made the joint-venture untenable. The Penrith Panthers rose from the bottom of the table to win the Premiership, while the Brisbane club returned to Lang Park mid-year. Season 2004 proved even more successful than 2003, with the North Queensland Cowboys going from 11th position in 2003 to third in 2004, narrowly missing out on a maiden Grand Final berth.

Crowd average records were broken in 2003, 2004 and 2005. In 2005, the NRL reached record levels of popularity for its competition. Total crowds for the competition season almost reached the figures for the last year of the competition conducted by the ARL competition of 1995, prior to the Super League war. The average attendance record remained until 2010. From 2004 to 2005, there was a 39% increase in sponsorship, a 41% increase in merchandise royalties, and a 12% increase in playing participation. In 2005, Business Review Weekly ranked the NRL 497 in revenue of Australian private companies, with revenue of A$66.1m (+7%) with 35 employees. In 2004, Canterbury-Bankstown put a year of turmoil and disgrace at the aftermath of the alleged rape scandal to hold aloft the NRL trophy and give the club their first premiership since 1995. In 2005, a record national audience of 4.1 million tuned in to watch the grand final between the Wests Tigers and the North Queensland Cowboys.

The 2006 Grand Final was won by the Brisbane Broncos over the Melbourne Storm, 15–8. The matchup was a significant milestone in the history of the NRL, as two interstate teams (teams not from New South Wales, the &quot;heartland&quot; of the NRL) contested the grand final for the first time. In the city of Melbourne, whose team was playing in their second grand final, the game&#x27;s television ratings were higher than in Sydney where the game was played. Crowds were down on 2005, however were better than any other year prior to that.

In its tenth season the NRL returned to having a club based on the Gold Coast, Queensland with the inclusion of the Gold Coast Titans. The Titans were the first professional sporting team to occupy the Gold Coast since 1998, when the Gold Coast Chargers were one of the teams removed during the NRL&#x27;s rationalisation process between the end of the Super League war and the 2000 season.

The 2007 season saw the return of Monday Night Football and the inclusion of two Friday night games. Both of which turned out to be ratings successes. Another change from the previous seasons was a reduction in the number of byes per team in the season. With an odd number of teams contesting between 2002 and 2006, the draw meant that at least one team would have to have a bye each weekend. With the inclusion of the 16th team for the 2007 season, the National Rugby League had the option of reverting to back to the system used between 2000 and 2001 where every team played each round. That system was not used however, with teams were given just a single bye during the year, grouped in periods that will assist clubs around representative fixtures.

The opening round saw two matches at Brisbane&#x27;s Lang Park, the first featuring reigning champions Brisbane against fellow Queensland side North Queensland, while the second match featured the new club, the Gold Coast, playing St. George Illawarra. The weather during the middle of the season was less than ideal, with cyclonic conditions severely affecting many NRL games played in Sydney and Newcastle.

The 2007 finals series saw the South Sydney Rabbitohs return to finals football for the first time in decades. The season culminated on 30 September 2007, with the grand final contested between Manly and Melbourne. Melbourne won the title 34–8 and the grand final achieved the honour of being the most watched television show in Australia in 2007.

Throughout 2008, the NRL celebrated 100 years since rugby league was introduced into Australia, with several initiatives to recognise the important milestone, including an extensive marketing campaign called the &#x27;Centenary of Rugby League&#x27;. The competition began in March, with a special Heritage round held in mid-April, coinciding with the first round of competition played in 1908.

At a Gala event on 17 April 2008 the Team of the Century was announced, being:
* Full-back: Clive Churchill
* Wingers: Ken Irvine, Brian Bevan
* Centres: Reg Gasnier, Mal Meninga
* Five-eighth: Wally Lewis
* Half-back: Andrew Johns
* Lock: John Raper

* Second Row: Norm Provan, Ron Coote
* Props: Arthur Beetson, Duncan Hall
* Hooker: Noel Kelly
* Reserves: Graeme Langlands, Dally Messenger, Bob Fulton, Frank Burge
* Coach: Jack Gibson.
For the second year in a row, the grand final was played between the Melbourne Storm and the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, in the NRL&#x27;s first ever twilight decider. The Manly club took out the premiership game 40–0, setting the record for the highest winning margin in a grand final (although the club formerly known as St. George Dragons were beaten 38–0 in 1975 and using the modern point scale of 4-point tries, this would amount to 46–0.) Furthermore, it was the first time a team had been kept scoreless in a Grand Final since 1978.

The 2009 season marked the beginning of the second century of rugby league in Australia.
The grand final that year was played between the Parramatta Eels and once again Melbourne Storm. Melbourne defeated Parramatta 23 – 16 to win the premiership to make it two premierships out of the last four grand finals for the Melbourne side.

In 2010 the Inaugural All Stars Match was held on 13 February, in conjunction with the Sorry Day reconciliation anniversary to promote rugby league&#x27;s long association and involvement with the Aboriginal community. The first match saw the Indigenous All Stars beat the NRL All Stars 16–12. The success of this event has seen it become a recurring fixture on the rugby league calendar with Queensland awarded the hosting rights for the next three years.

The 29th State of Origin series was also played featuring the world&#x27;s first live free-to-air 3D TV broadcast. Queensland later made further history by winning an unprecedented fifth series in a row, and winning the 2010 series by a scoreline of 3–0, their first Origin whitewash since 1995.

In 2010 the NRL set a record total season average attendance of 17,367 per game and a record total season aggregate attendance of 3,490,778.

During the 2010 finals series, the second qualifying match between the Wests Tigers and Sydney Roosters became the first McIntyre system final to go into extra time, with the One Hundred Minute Epic described in media circles as one of the greatest of the modern era.

The 2010 grand final was played between the St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Sydney Roosters. St. George Illawarra won 32–8. This was the first premiership won by the club in its eleven-year existence and the first time in 31 years for the St. George part of the joint venture.

===2010–2019: Establishment of the ARLC===
After several years of preparation and build up, on 14 December 2010 the Australian Rugby League and News Corporation agreed upon a constitutional framework paving the way for the establishment of a new and independent commission to govern the sport in Australia. The negotiations of such a framework became drawn out over establishing details, primarily of sponsorship, media rights, funding of state bodies, funding of the Melbourne Storm, debate over News Ltd private ownership of clubs, and also of individual appointments to the new body.
The 2011 grand final was contested between the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the New Zealand Warriors. This was the second grand final involving the New Zealand Warriors. Manly recorded a 24–10 win claiming their second premiership under head coach Des Hasler.

On 10 February 2012, the independent commission, known as the Australian Rugby League Commission assumed control of all levels of the game, replacing former state based boards and assuming full control of the NRL from the NRL partnership (comprising the previous ARL board and News Limited).
The current Chairman is Peter V&#x27;landys AM. The 2012 Grand Final involved the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Melbourne Storm, this was the first time since 2008 that the first and second placed teams contested the grand final. The Melbourne Storm recorded a 14–4 victory thus achieving their second premiership and claiming some vengeance for the stripped premierships.
The 2013 season saw the resurgence of foundation clubs the Sydney Roosters and the South Sydney Rabbitohs with both clubs finishing first and second place respectively. The NRL was also left with a black eye after the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks were caught using performance-enhancing substances by ASADA dating back to 2011. The 2013 Grand Final was played between the Sydney Roosters and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles with the Roosters recording a 26–18 victory.

The 2014 season started with the introduction of the Auckland Nines and was marred by the handing down of a million dollar fine to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for their role in the ASADA scandal while head coach Shane Flanagan was suspended for the entirety of the 2014 season. The 2014 Grand Final was contested by the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. This was South Sydney&#x27;s first grand final appearance since 1971. South Sydney would break their 43-year premiership drought with a 30–6 victory.

The 2015 season saw the return of the Queensland juggernauts, The North Queensland Cowboys and the Brisbane Broncos who would finish inside the top four and contest the 2015 Grand Final. The 2015 Grand Final is considered by many to be the greatest grand final of all time as a high intensity match ended in dramatic circumstances when North Queensland scored as the full-time siren sounded. Johnathan Thurston would miss the conversion from the sideline as the ball hit the post thus sending the match into golden point, the first golden point grand final. Ben Hunt would drop the ball on the kick-off and hand the North Queensland side the chance to win which was converted as Johnathan Thurston successfully kicked a field goal to win the match 17–16.

The 2016 season saw the Melbourne Storm return to the minor premiership position while the Canberra Raiders returned to the top four for the first time since the 2003. The Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and reigning premiers North Queensland would fill out the top four. The season continued a trend of the minor premiership not being decided to the final round, the fourth consecutive year. The 2016 Grand Final was contested between the Melbourne Storm and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, it was the Cronulla&#x27;s fourth grand final appearance while it was the seventh for the Melbourne club. The match was a tight affair and was not settled until after the siren had sounded. The Cronulla-Sutherland claimed their first premiership ending a famous 49-year drought by a score of 14–12.

Following the success generated by the 2017 Women&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup, a national women&#x27;s league was established, and the first season commenced in September 2018 comprising four clubs aligned to existing NRL clubs.

===2020–2021: COVID affected seasons and further expansion===
On 22 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the NRL became one of the last major sports in the world to continue playing games. Following the imposition of the first COVID-19 restrictions, the NRL initially announced it would be moving forward with the season. The decision prompted a wave of condemnation online, including from Australian personalities and sport people. The following day after Queensland closed its borders, the NRL announced that the season would have to be suspended indefinitely. It was feared that some teams would not survive this period without income, as it was foreseen as a financial catastrophe.

On 9 April 2020, ARL Commissioner Wayne Pearce announced the NRL would return on 28 May. The announcement came under heavy criticism from the Government of New South Wales and health officials, with Premier Gladys Berejiklian saying she had not approved a return. However, the NRL released documents signed by NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller, showing approval for the NRL to continue without crowds. The competition ended up kicking off on that date, with the Parramatta Eels defeating the Brisbane Broncos 34–6 at Lang Park behind closed doors. The match drew the highest TV ratings for a regular season game since 2014. The NRL returned a full two weeks before any other sport in Australia, and were the first sport to return to play worldwide that actually ceased play.

In October 2021, after months of speculation, the NRL and the ARLC announced that the competition would expand to 17 teams, with the admission of the Dolphins, based out of the suburb of Redcliffe in greater Brisbane, for the 2023 season.

===2022 – present: Further expansion===
Following the introduction of the Dolphins in 2023, NRL executives spoke openly about the desire to further expand the competition. On 12 March 2023, reports emerged that the ARL Commission was working towards a 20-team competition, and sought to achieve this target before the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane. ARLC CEO Andrew Abdo and chairman Peter V’landys confirmed the plan would be to add three teams to the NRL by 2030, of which up to two could be based outside of Australia.

In October 2024 a Perth, Western Australia bid, in consultation with the North Sydney Bears and backed by the Western Australian Government, was reported however this was rejected 2 weeks later by the NRL commission over fears the consortium would be unable to fund the $20 million expansion fee. By November, talks had resumed and the Western Bears were largely expected to be announced as the NRL&#x27;s 18th team, entering in the 2027 season.

On 12 December 2024, ARLC chairman Peter V&#x27;Landy&#x27;s, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Prime Minister James Marape announced a team based in Papua New Guinea would enter the NRL in the 2028 season. The $600 million venture is funded by the Australian Government for a ten-year period and was made in conjunction with a parallel agreement concerning &quot;strategic trust&quot; and security between the two countries. The team will be based in the capital city of Port Moresby and play home matches at the National Football Stadium. The bid would be partiually funded by the Australian Government, providing $600M over 10 years to develop the competition in PNG

==Governance==
Since the NRL commenced in 1998 there have been six CEOs, they are:

*1998–1999: Neil Whittaker
*1999–2001: David Moffett
*2002–2012: David Gallop
*2012–2015: David Smith
*2016–2020: Todd Greenberg
*2020–present: Andrew Abdo
Since the Australian Rugby League Commission was inaugurated in 2012, there have been three chairmen:

* 2012–2017: John Grant
* 2017–2019: Peter Beattie 
* 2019–present: Peter V&#x27;landys

==Teams==
The NRL currently consists of seventeen clubs. Nine clubs are based within the Greater Sydney area (including one that also represents the Illawarra region south of Sydney), another in regional New South Wales, four in Queensland, and one each in Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, and New Zealand. The league operates on a single group system, with no divisions or conferences and no relegation or promotion.

A total of twenty-three clubs have played in the NRL since its first season in 1998. Eleven clubs have been members for every season.

Two of the clubs currently in the NRL were founded in 1908, the first year of rugby league competition in Australia: the Sydney Roosters (founded as &#x27;Eastern Suburbs&#x27;) and the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The Wests Tigers are a merger of two other foundation clubs: The Western Suburbs Magpies and the Balmain Tigers.

== Season structure ==

=== Pre-season===
The NRL pre-season typically begins in February and ends in early March. Clubs generally use this time to organise trial matches to test playing combinations. However, some clubs play for trophies: Easts and Wests play for the Foundation Cup while South Sydney and St. George Illawarra play for the Charity Shield. The trials are typically played in cities and towns that normally don&#x27;t host NRL matches. In the past a World Sevens rugby league football tournament has been hosted, however this was scrapped due to injury concerns. 2023 saw the introduction of the NRL Pre-season Challenge to create a more structured pre-season for each club.

====All Stars match====

Beginning in 2010, the All Stars match has become a major fixture in the NRL preseason. The teams are chosen via public voting and the two sides play for the Arthur Beetson Trophy. In 2018, the game was temporarily removed from the calendar due to the World Cup being played the previous year citing an excessive player workload. The match returned in 2019 and was hosted in Melbourne with the Australian Indigenous All Stars taking on the New Zealand Maori All Stars.

====NRL Nines====

In 2014, the inaugural rugby league nines tournament took place, featuring all sixteen NRL clubs. It was initially staged at Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand. Women&#x27;s nines games were also fixtured alongside the main tournament between the Australian and New Zealand national women&#x27;s teams, however in later tournaments included NRLW teams. It was envisaged that the tournament would become a regular fixture each year, however, by 2018 the tournament was removed from the calendar citing an excessive player workload, it was brought back in 2020 but hasn&#x27;t been played since for the same reason.

====World Club Challenge====

The World Club Challenge is an annual pre-season match played between the champion of the National Rugby League and the champion of the Super League. The first match of its kind was the 1976 World Club Challenge and it was then played sporadically throughout the late 80s and 90s, including a one off Super League tournament in 1997, before becoming a regular annual pre-season fixture since 2000.

In 2015, the competition was expanded to include two exhibition games before the Challenge game. This expanded series, called the &quot;World Club Series&quot;, ran from 2015 to 2017. The first two Series saw the leagues&#x27; champions joined by two invited teams from each league, resulting in a three-game series. Each invited team represented their league in a single game, played in the days leading up to the usual Challenge match. In 2017, only one invited team from each league participated, with the NRL citing tight schedules, distant travel and long seasons as an impediment to the Series. In 2018 the series was cancelled, with only the usual Challenge match played and has continued as a single match since.

===Premiership rounds===

As rugby league is a winter sport in Australia, the NRL premiership season begins in early March, with games played every weekend for 27 weeks, until the start of September. In most rounds, one match is played on Thursday night, two on Friday night, three on Saturday and two on Sunday. Teams receive two competition points for a win, and one point for a draw. The bye also receives two points; a loss, no points. Teams on the ladder are ranked by competition points, then match points differential (for and against) and points percentage are used to separate teams with equal competition points. At the end of the regular season, the club which is ranked highest on the ladder is declared minor premiers.

====Rugby League Las Vegas====
Beginning in the 2024 season Rugby League Las Vegas is an annual event held at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas showcasing the sport of rugby league. The event was created by the NRL to expand the audience of the competition and develop rugby league in the United States. It features two Round 1 NRL matches and from 2025, a Round 1 Super League game as well. The event is currently contracted until 2028.

====Magic Round====

In 2019, the NRL introduced Magic Round, which featured all matches playing at Lang Park in Brisbane over the weekend. It was deemed a success and has now been a scheduled annual event since.

====Themed rounds====

Special themed weeks within the premiership rounds include ANZAC Round, Heritage Round, Women in League Round, Retro Round, Beanies for Brain Cancer round, and Rivalry Round. Separate trophies between rival teams are also presented throughout the season.

In 2022, the NRL held various themed rounds, including a Pride Round (to celebrate and respect inclusivity of LGBTQI players); Multicultural Round; ANZAC Round; Brain Cancer Round; and Women in League Round. However, following the boycott of the game by seven Manly players who refused to wear the specially designed jersey and ensuing poor publicity, it was decided not to have a Pride Round in 2023, but to stick with the other four rounds.

===Mid-season representative rounds===
As well as playing for their club in the premiership, NRL players are regularly selected to play in a number of representative competitions that are conducted throughout each season. The representative rounds generally occurs in a period of that runs from about the middle of April until the middle of July each year. These matches have included:

* The annual Anzac Test between Australia and New Zealand (April–May; 1997–2017)
* The New South Wales City vs Country Origin match (Early to mid April, same weekend as the Anzac Test)
* Test matches between Pacific Island Nations, played on the same weekend as the Anzac Test and City vs Country Origin. These games feature matches placed between the Cook Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga, and includes the Melanesian Cup and Polynesian Cup
* The three match State of Origin series (June – July)
* Additionally, players from outside Oceania may travel home to take part in training camps or matches for their national side.

===Finals series===

The eight highest placed teams at the end of the regular season compete in the finals series. The system consists of a number of games between the top eight teams over four weeks in September, until only two teams remain. These two teams then contest the grand final, which is usually played on the first Sunday of October. From 1998 to 2011, the NRL used the McIntyre final eight system but with the introduction of the ARLC, it was decided to change to the current format which was perceived as fairer for teams finishing in the top four.

===Grand final===
The NRL Grand Final, which determines the season&#x27;s premiers, is one of Australia&#x27;s major sporting events and is one of the largest attended club championship events in the world. It has been contested at Sydney&#x27;s Stadium Australia each year since 1999, with the exception of 2021 when it was played at Brisbane&#x27;s Lang Park due to the COVID pandemic. The first year it was held at Stadium Australia, the NRL Grand Final broke the record for attendance at an Australian rugby league game, with 107,999 people attending.

The game itself is usually preceded by an opening ceremony featuring entertainment and the singing of the national anthem by well-known Australasian and international musical acts. At the conclusion of the grand final there is a presentation ceremony where the winning team are awarded the Provan-Summons Trophy and premiership rings to each player and the head coach. The player judged to be the man-of-the-match by the Australian national team selectors is awarded the prestigious Clive Churchill Medal and the Prime Minister of Australia is typically on-hand to hand the trophy to the winning captain.

===Post-season internationals===
Following the premiership&#x27;s conclusion other representative matches occasionally occur. These have included:
* The quadrennial World Cup
* The Four Nations tournament – Australia, New Zealand and England plus another qualifier
* The Prime Minister&#x27;s XIII match in Papua New Guinea
* The Rugby League World Cup 9s
* Additional test Matches between Australia and New Zealand.
* The Rugby League Pacific Championship
* Tours to European Rugby League countries, or hosting tours of European Rugby League national teams

==Title winners==

===By season===
;Notes
:::a: Melbourne Storm were stripped of their 2007, 2009 premiership titles and their 2006, 2007, 2008 minor premiership titles due to their breach of the salary cap. The titles were withheld by the NRL rather than awarding them to the runners up.

=== By club ===
Although the NRL was not formed until 1998, the league recognises clubs who were named Premiers before the league&#x27;s foundation. Clubs highlighted in green indicates those currently competing in the NRL; years in bold indicate those in the NRL era. The Gold Coast Titans and the Dolphins are the only current clubs that have not reached a grand final.
==Players==
National Rugby League footballers are among Australasia&#x27;s most famous athletes, commanding multimillion-dollar playing contracts and sponsorship deals. Each club in the NRL has a &quot;top squad&quot; of twenty-five players, who are signed under a salary cap. For the most part, the players who play in NRL matches are sourced from these top squads. During a season the need may arise for a club to use players outside these 25, in which case players are usually sourced from the club&#x27;s corresponding NRL Under-20s team or a feeder club in the New South Wales Cup or Queensland Cup.

===Demographics===
In the recent years, the influence of Polynesian players on the NRL has grown, with figures from the 2011 season showing that 35% of NRL players and over 45% of NRL Under-20s players are of Polynesian background. This increase in Polynesian players has been blamed for the decline of Indigenous players, dropping from 21% in the 1990s to 11% for the 2009 season.

The first Indigenous Australian to play in the NSWRL/NRL was New South Wales Rugby League premiership player George Green, who debuted in 1909. Since that time, many high-profile indigenous athletes have played in the competition, including Arthur Beetson (the first Aboriginal person to captain an Australian national team in any sport) and former Test match representatives Johnathan Thurston and Greg Inglis.

At the elite level of the game, Indigenous Australians represented 35% of the roster for the Kangaroos, 21% of players at the 2012 State of Origin series, 12% of NRL players and a further 8% of the NRL Under-20s players. By way of comparison, 2.3% of the Australian population identified themselves as Indigenous in the 2006 Australian census.

To celebrate the strong Indigenous ties to the game, the NRL holds a preseason All Stars game, featuring a team made up of Indigenous Australians playing a publicly voted team consisting of the non-Indigenous players, and an Indigenous Leadership Group has formed, consisting of the game&#x27;s elite Indigenous players. The Leadership Group hosts regular multi-day camps where all Indigenous NRL players are invited to learn more about Indigenous culture.

Both the All Stars match and the Leadership Group were ideas pioneered by former player Preston Campbell, with the All Stars man of the match receiving the Preston Campbell medal.

===Salary cap===

A salary cap was introduced to the NSWRL in 1990 to even the playing field of teams in the Winfield Cup.
As of 2013 the club grant is $7.1 million which covers the salary cap of $5.85 million and a minimum wage for $80,000 for the top twenty-five players at each club. The salary cap increased to $6.3 million in 2014, $6.55 million in 2015, $6.8 million by 2016 and $7 million in 2017.

The cap is actively policed and penalties for clubs found to have breached the NRL salary cap regulations include fines of lesser of half the amount involved or $500,000 and/or deduction of premiership points. For example, six clubs were fined for minor infractions in 2003. These infractions are usually technical in nature, and can sometimes be affected by third-party factors such as loss of sponsorship revenue affecting an allowance. During the 2007 season the NRL implemented ways of creating a fair and more beneficial cap for players and clubs.

In 2010, following the Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal, the NRL introduced requirements for players and their agents to sign statutory declarations pledging their contracts comply with salary cap regulations, where previously only club chairmen and chief executives did so for biannual salary cap audits.

Major breaches of the cap

In 2002, the Bulldogs were fined the maximum of $500,000 and deducted all 37 premiership points received during the season after it was found that they had committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap totalling $2.13 million over the past three years, including $750,000 in 2001 and $920,000 in 2002; these were described by NRL chief executive David Gallop as &quot;exceptional in both its size and its deliberate and ongoing nature&quot;. The points penalty meant that the club won the 2002 wooden spoon (Souths would have finished last if not for the breaches), and as the club had been leading the competition table prior to the imposition of the penalties, this was a shattering outcome for the club and its fans. Two senior club officials were jailed for fraud as a result of these breaches.

In 2005, the New Zealand Warriors were fined $430,000 and were ordered to start the 2006 season with a four premiership point deficit and cut their payroll by $450,000 after club officials revealed that their former management had exceeded the salary cap by $1.1 million over the last two years. The points penalty meant that the Warriors missed a finals berth in 2006.

On 22 April 2010, following revelations by an internal whistleblower and investigation by the NRL, Storm officials revealed that the club had committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap regulations between 2006 and 2010 by running a well-organized dual contract and bookkeeping system that concealed a total of $3.78 million in payments made to players outside of the salary cap from the NRL. This included: $303,000 in 2006, $459,000 in 2007, $957,000 in 2008, $1.021 million in 2009 and $1.04 million in 2010. As a result, the club was stripped of the 2007 and 2009 premierships, 2006–2008 minor premierships and the following year, the 2010 World Club Challenge trophy. They were also fined a then Australian sporting record of $1.689 million ($1.1 million in NRL prize money which was equally distributed between the remaining 15 clubs, $89,000 in prize money from the World Club Challenge which was distributed to the Leeds Rhinos, and a maximum of $500,000 for breaching the salary cap regulations). In addition they were ordered to cut their payroll by $1.0125 million, deducted all eight premiership points received during the 2010 season and barred from receiving premiership points for the remainder of the 2010 season. The points penalty meant that the club won the 2010 wooden spoon. The former directors attempted unsuccessful legal action against the penalties which collapsed, and the club also had to pay the NRLs legal costs. The matter was also referred to ASIC, the Australian Tax Office, the Victorian State Revenue Office, and the Victoria Police to investigate possible fraud however by May 2011 these investigations were closed. The players themselves were found to have not done anything wrong during this time so individual awards are recognised in addition, the players were still eligible for Test/State of Origin selection.

Prior to the start of the 2016 NRL season, the Parramatta Eels faced the prospect with starting the season on −4 points due to salary cap indiscretions in 2015, however the NRL was satisfied with governance changes at the Eels and no points were deducted. However, it was revealed in March that third-party payments had been made by several companies to several players, which is strictly prohibited in the NRL. On 3 May 2016, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg announced that the club would be docked the twelve competition points they have accrued so far this season, as well as fined $1 million and stripped of the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title it won in February. In addition, the NRL also announced that the Eels would not be able to accrue any further competition points until they fall under the salary cap, which they were reported to be $500,000 over as of 3 May 2016. Five officials, including chairman Steve Sharp, deputy chairman Tom Issa, director Peter Serrao, chief executive John Boulous and football manager Daniel Anderson, were also sacked. On 9 July, after over 2 months of club officials contesting the preliminary penalties, Parramatta were handed their punishment with the addition of their for/against points tally accumulated from rounds 1–9 being deducted.

In 2018, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles were fined $750,000, two officials (Neil Bare and Joe Kelly were suspended and a $660,000 penalty was applied to the salary cap for 2018 and the next year for breaches of the salary cap). Manly was proved by the NRL chief executive that third-party payments and deals were made to attract more players to the club.

Judiciary and Integrity Unit

The NRL Judiciary is made up of former players who convene in three-man panels to rule on on-field incidents. The judiciary is currently chaired by Wollongong district court judge Paul Conlon and made up of former players Mal Cochrane, Michael Buettner, Bradley Clyde, Sean Garlick, Don McKinnon and Bob Lindner.

An integrity Unit was formed on 7 February 2013 and was headed by former Federal Court judge Tony Whitlam, since 2022 the new head of the NRL integrity Unit is former Manly Sea-Eagles front-row forward, Jason King.

== Awards ==

=== Provan-Summons trophy ===

The Provan-Summons trophy is the NRL&#x27;s main prize, awarded to the team that wins the premiership. Its sculptured design is similar to the Winfield Cup trophy, which was introduced for the 1982 NSWRFL season. It is a three-dimensional cast of a famous photo called &quot;The Gladiators&quot;, which depicts a mud-soaked Norm Provan of St. George and Arthur Summons of Western Suburbs embracing after the 1963 NSWRFL season&#x27;s Grand Final. It was not officially named the Provan-Summons Trophy until 2013, the 50th anniversary of the 1963 Grand Final. The trophy is awarded following each grand final to the captain of the winning club. The trophy was mysteriously broken during grand final celebrations in 2021.

Each player from the premiership winning side are also awarded Premiership Rings.

===J. J. Giltinan Shield===
Created in 1951, the J. J. Giltinan Shield is awarded to the club ranked highest on the NRL ladder after the premiership season concludes. Typically this team is known as the minor premiers.

===Clive Churchill medal===
The Clive Churchill Medal is awarded to the most outstanding player in a grand final. It is named after former Australian fullback Clive Churchill.

The Dally M Medal is the highlight of the Dally M Awards and was named after Henry Herbert &#x27;Dally&#x27; Messenger, who was instrumental in the establishment of rugby league football in Australia.
The awards were introduced in 1980 by News Limited.
The Dally M has been the official player-of-the-year award, and the highest individual honour in Australian rugby league, since the unification of the game in 1998. Before 1998 the highest award was the Rothmans Medal.

The medal is awarded, usually by the Australian Prime Minister, at the annual Dally M Awards night.
As well as honouring the best and fairest player of the year, the Dally M awards recognise the premier player in each position, the best coach and the most outstanding rookie of the season.

===The Immortals===
Originally The Immortals were four players named by the sport&#x27;s major Australian magazine &quot;Rugby League Week&quot; as the nation&#x27;s greatest ever.

Established in 1981, the group was four former Test captains, Clive Churchill, Bob Fulton, Reg Gasnier, Johnny Raper and were those appointed by &quot;Rugby League Week&quot; between 1981 and 2012. Wally Lewis, Graeme Langlands added in 1999 Arthur Beetson 2003 Andrew Johns 2012

Following the demise of &quot;Rugby League Week&quot;, the Australian Rugby League Commission took ownership of The Immortals concept and expanded the group on 1 August 2018 by inclusion of Mal Meninga, Norm Provan, Frank Burge, Dave Brown and Dally Messenger. Ron Coote was named the 14th immortal in 2024.

=== Queensland Rugby League&#x27;s Team of the Century ===
The Queensland Rugby League&#x27;s Team of the Century is a team that consisted of the greatest rugby league players from 1909 to 2008. This team was picked by six judges in 2008 from a list of 100 nominated players.

Some notables who have been NRL cheerleaders include Jennifer Hawkins (Miss Universe 2004) for the Newcastle Knights, Chloe Butler (Lingerie Football League) for the Canberra Raiders and Tabrett Bethell (actress, 2007–2016) for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks.

== Sponsorship ==
The NRL and its clubs receive significant revenue from sponsorships, with sponsors&#x27; logos appearing on most parts of players&#x27; and referees&#x27; uniforms, the playing surface and even the ball itself. Since 2001, the National Rugby League premiership has been sponsored by Telstra and known as the &#x27;NRL Telstra Premiership&#x27;. Prior to this, the competition was simply known as the &#x27;National Rugby League&#x27;.

The Telstra Premiership has had five competition logos since 2001. The first, lasting only through the 2001 regular season, was the Telstra logo with an elongated circle enclosing the word &quot;Premiership&quot;. From the Finals series of 2001 through to the end of 2006 the logo was based around the shape of a football, with the words &quot;Telstra Premiership&quot; on respective lines along the bottom, culminating with a small football similar to the one in the official NRL logo at the peak. The main colours were dark blue and orange, the corporate colours of Telstra. The company worked with the NRL to create the third logo for the 2007 season onward as part of a new sponsorship deal. This logo was quite similar to the original National Rugby League emblem. From the 2011 Finals Series, a newer logo was commissioned in concert with a corporate re-brand undertaken by Telstra. The 2007 logo remained on club jerseys until 2012 due to the lateness of the change and was phased out in time for the 2013 NRL Season. From 2013, under a dramatic image rebranding of the competition, the Telstra Premiership logo was changed in conjunction with a new sponsorship deal to incorporate the key elements of rugby league in Australia to include the shield and chevrons, the green and gold, a red &quot;Telstra&quot; logo perched above the top of the shield and for the first time the iconic Provan-Summons trophy awarded to the premiers at the end of the season centred in the middle of the badge.

At the end of the 2018 season the NRL launched a bold new look for its Telstra Premiership. The new look aims to modernise the Telstra Premiership brand as well as integrate it more seamlessly with the 16 clubs. The new brand, highlighting the shield and the chevron – which have both been synonymous with Rugby League since the game&#x27;s inception.

Other notable sponsorships include Kia (Thursday Night Football), KFC (Friday Night Football), Bundaberg Rum (Super Saturday), Chemist Warehouse (Sunday Football). Steeden is the official match ball supplier, Westpac sponsor the match ball. The State of Origin series and the Australian Test matches (Kangaroos). Youi and Harvey Norman sponsor the on-field match officials and Swyftx sponsors the NRL Bunker. Other Official NRL Sponsors are: Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, DoorDash, Hankook, Hisense, Home Hardware, Rebel, Treasury Wine Estates (Wolf Blass), Accor, Drinkwise, P&amp;O, Gallagher and EISS Super. Partners of the NRLW Competition are: Telstra, Harvey Norman, Chemist Warehouse, Flight Centre and Rebel.

<text>Kawaii is a Japanese cultural phenomenon which emphasizes cuteness, childlike innocence, charm, and simplicity. &quot;Kawaii&quot; culture began to flourish in the 1970s, driven by youth culture and the rise of cute characters in manga and anime (comics and animation) and merchandise, exemplified by the creation of Hello Kitty by Sanrio in 1974. The &quot;kawaii&quot; aesthetic is characterized by soft or pastel colors, rounded shapes, and features which evoke vulnerability, such as big eyes and small mouths, and has become a prominent aspect of Japanese popular culture, influencing entertainment (including toys and idols), fashion (such as Lolita fashion), advertising, and product design.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;kawaii&quot; originally derives from the phrase &quot;kao hayushi&quot;, which literally means &quot;(one&#x27;s) face (is) aglow,&quot; commonly used to refer to flushing or blushing of the face. The second morpheme is cognate with &quot;-bayu&quot; in &quot;mabayui&quot; (眩い, 目映い, or 目映ゆい) &quot;dazzling, glaring, blinding, too bright; dazzlingly beautiful&quot; (&quot;ma-&quot; is from &quot;me&quot; &quot;eye&quot;) and &quot;-hayu&quot; in &quot;omohayui&quot; (面映ゆい) &quot;embarrassed/embarrassing, awkward, feeling self-conscious/making one feel self-conscious&quot; (&quot;omo-&quot; is from 面 &quot;omo&quot;, an archaic word for &quot;face, looks, features; surface; image, semblance, vestige&quot;). Over time, the meaning changed into the modern meaning of &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;pretty&quot; , and the pronunciation changed to &quot;kawayui&quot; and then to the modern &quot;kawaii&quot;. It is commonly written in hiragana, , but the ateji, , is also frequently used. The romanized kanji in the ateji literally translates to &quot;able to love/be loved, can/may love, lovable.&quot; 

Various modern Standard Japanese words have related meanings such as the adjectival noun かわいそう &quot;kawaisō&quot; (often written with &quot;ateji&quot; as 可哀相 or 可哀想) &quot;piteous, pitiable, arousing compassion, poor, sad, sorry&quot; (etymologically from 顔映様 &quot;face / projecting, reflecting, or transmitting light, flushing, blushing / seeming, appearance&quot;). Forms of &quot;kawaii&quot; and its derivatives &quot;kawaisō&quot; and &quot;kawairashii&quot; (with the suffix &quot;-rashii&quot; &quot;-like, -ly&quot;) are used in modern dialects to mean &quot;embarrassing/embarrassed, shameful/ashamed&quot; or &quot;good, nice, fine, excellent, superb, splendid, admirable&quot;.

==History==

===Precursors===

The notion of “kawaii” is traditionally traced back to Sei Shōnagon’s The Pillow Book between 900s-1000s, where in the section on “Pretty things”, she mentions several things that clearly fit the modern notion of cuteness (e.g., a face of a child drawn on a melon; ). Kawaii culture is an off-shoot of Japanese girls’ culture, which flourished with the creation of girl secondary schools after 1899. This postponement of marriage and children allowed for the rise of a girl youth culture in shōjo magazines and shōjo manga directed at girls in the pre-war period.

===Cute handwriting===
In the 1970s, the popularity of the kawaii aesthetic inspired a style of writing. Many teenage girls contributed to the development of this style; the handwriting was made by writing laterally, often while using mechanical pencils. These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional Japanese writing that varied in thickness and was vertical. The teenage girls would also write in big, round characters and add little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, emoticon faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet.

These pictures made the writing very difficult to read. As a result, this writing style caused a lot of controversy and was banned in many schools. During the 1980s, however, this new &quot;cute&quot; writing was adopted by magazines and comics and was often key to packaging and advertising products, especially toys for children or “cute accessories”.

From 1984 to 1986, studied the development of cute handwriting (which he called Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting) in depth. This type of cute Japanese handwriting has also been called: , meaning &quot;round writing&quot;, , meaning &quot;kitten writing&quot;, , meaning &quot;comic writing&quot;, and , meaning &quot;fake-child writing&quot;. Although it was commonly thought that the writing style was something that teenagers had picked up from comics, Kazuma found that teenagers had created the style themselves, spontaneously, as part of an ‘underground trend’. His conclusion was based on the observation that cute handwriting predates the availability of the technical means for producing rounded writing in comics.

==== Use in Japanese Language ====
Usage of Kawaii in Japanese is general and can be used in a variety of situations to describe aesthetics, to give a compliment, or to add a pleasantry or salutation to a conversation.

===Cute merchandise===

, author of &quot;Cool Japan&quot;, says cute fashion in Japan can be traced back to the Edo period with the popularity of netsuke. Illustrator Rune Naito, who produced illustrations of &quot;large-headed&quot; (&quot;nitōshin&quot;) girls and cartoon animals for Japanese girls&#x27; magazines from the 1950s to the 1970s, is credited with pioneering what would become the culture and aesthetic of kawaii.

Because of this trend, companies such as Sanrio came out with merchandise like Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to develop in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities that appeal to an older audience, such as Gudetama and Aggretsuko. These characters have enjoyed great popularity as fans are drawn to their quirks as well as their cute aesthetics. The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as Seiko Matsuda, who is largely credited with popularizing the style. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls. The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old.

==Aesthetics==

, in his work &quot;Kawaii Syndrome&quot;, claims &quot;cute&quot; and &quot;neat&quot; have taken precedence over the former Japanese aesthetics of &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;refined&quot;. As a cultural phenomenon, cuteness is increasingly accepted in Japan as a part of Japanese culture and national identity. , author of &quot;Cool Japan&quot;, believes that &quot;cuteness&quot; is rooted in Japan&#x27;s harmony-loving culture, and , a sociology professor at Musashi University in Tokyo, has stated that &quot;cute&quot; is a &quot;magic term&quot; that encompasses everything that is acceptable and desirable in Japan.

===Physical attractiveness===
In Japan, being cute is acceptable for both men and women. A trend existed of men shaving their legs to mimic the neotenic look. Japanese women often try to act cute to attract men. A study by Kanebo, a cosmetic company, found that Japanese women in their 20s and 30s favored the &quot;cute look&quot; with a &quot;childish round face&quot;. Women also employ a look of innocence in order to further play out this idea of cuteness. Having large eyes is one aspect that exemplifies innocence; therefore, many Japanese women attempt to alter the size of their eyes. To create this illusion, women may wear large contact lenses, false eyelashes, dramatic eye makeup, and even have an East Asian blepharoplasty, commonly known as double eyelid surgery.

===Idols===
 are media personalities in their teens and twenties who are considered particularly attractive or cute and who will, for a period ranging from several months to a few years, regularly appear in the mass media, e.g. as singers for pop groups, bit-part actors, TV personalities (&quot;tarento&quot;), models in photo spreads published in magazines, advertisements, etc. (But not every young celebrity is considered an idol. Young celebrities who wish to cultivate a rebellious image, such as many rock musicians, reject the &quot;idol&quot; label.) Speed, Morning Musume, AKB48, and Momoiro Clover Z are examples of popular idol groups in Japan during the 2000s &amp; 2010s.

===Cute fashion===
====Lolita====

Lolita fashion is a very well-known and recognizable style in Japan. Based on Victorian fashion and the Rococo period, girls mix in their own elements along with gothic style to achieve the porcelain-doll look. The girls who dress in Lolita fashion try to look cute, innocent, and beautiful. This look is achieved with lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Parasols, chunky Mary Jane heels, and Bo Peep collars are also very popular.

Sweet Lolita is a subset of Lolita fashion that includes even more ribbons, bows, and lace and is often fabricated out of pastels and other light colors. Head-dresses such as giant bows or bonnets are also very common, while lighter make-up is sometimes used to achieve a more natural look. Curled hair extensions, sometimes accompanied by eyelash extensions, are also popular in helping with the baby doll look. Another cute fashion with some crossover in &quot;sweet Lolita&quot; is Fairy Kei.

Themes such as fruits, flowers, and sweets are often used as patterns on the fabrics used for dresses. Purses often go with the themes and are shaped like hearts, strawberries, or stuffed animals. &quot;Baby, the Stars Shine Bright&quot; is one of the more popular clothing stores for this style and often carries themes. Mannerisms are also important to many Sweet Lolitas. Sweet Lolita is sometimes not only a fashion but also a lifestyle. This is evident in the 2004 film &quot;Kamikaze Girls&quot; where the main Lolita character, Momoko, drinks only tea and eats only sweets.

Gothic Lolita, Kuro Lolita, Shiro Lolita, and Military Lolita are all subtypes, also, in the US Anime Convention scene Casual Lolita.

====Decora====

Decora is a style that is characterized by wearing many &quot;decorations&quot; on oneself. It is considered to be self-decoration. The goal of this fashion is to become as vibrant and characterized as possible. People who take part in this fashion trend wear accessories such as multicolor hair pins, bracelets, rings, necklaces, etc. By adding multiple layers of accessories to an outfit, the fashion trend tends to have a childlike appearance. Some individuals may find the exaggerated childlike elements of the kawaii aesthetic to be off-putting or inauthentic. Others, however, appreciate the positivity, innocence, and lightheartedness associated with the kawaii style. It also includes toys and multicolor clothes. Decora and Fairy Kei have some crossover.

====Fairy Kei====
Fairy Kei is a youthful style based on 1980s fashion that evokes a dreamy, nostalgic feeling. Outfits are made up of pastel colors, angels, toys and generally cute motifs and elements and accessories from Western toy lines of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as Polly Pocket, My Little Pony, Strawberry Shortcake, Rainbow Brite, Popples, Lady Lovely Locks, Barbie, Wuzzles, and Care Bears. Pastel-colored hair is common, although natural hair is also popular, and hairstyles are usually kept simple and decorated with anything cute or pastel; bows are a common theme. Some common items used in a Fairy Kei coordinate include vintage sweaters, cardigans, varsity jackets, tutus, mini skirts, tights, over-the-knee socks, sneakers, and tea party shoes. The term &quot;Fairy Kei&quot; originated from the magazine called &quot;Zipper&quot; (despite a common belief that Sayuri Tabuchi [Tavuchi], the owner of Tokyo fashion store &quot;Spank!&quot;, was the accidental creator of the style).

====Kimo-kawaii/Yami-kawaii====
Kimo-kawaii, also known as &quot;creepy-cute&quot; or &quot;gross-cute&quot; in Japanese, has a unique look by combining Kawaii aesthetics with stylistic elements of horror and macabre. The style emerged in the 1990s when some people lost interest in cute and innocent characters and fashion. It is usually achieved by wearing creepy or gross clothes or accessories with a stronger emphasis on dark themes and colors. Yami-kawaii or &quot;sickly-cute&quot;, emerged in the mid-2010s to emphasize themes of mental health, vulnerability, and emotional darkness through fashion. In contrast to Kimo-kawaii, the style uses black, deep purple, and gray colors on teardrops, broken hearts, pill capsules, and other melancholic motifs.

====Kawaii men====
Although typically a female-dominated fashion, some men partake in the kawaii trend. Men wearing masculine kawaii accessories is very uncommon, and typically the men cross-dress as kawaii women instead by wearing wigs, false eyelashes, applying makeup, and wearing kawaii female clothing. This is seen predominately in male entertainers, such as Torideta-san, a DJ who transforms himself into a kawaii woman when working at his nightclub.

Japanese pop stars and actors often have longer hair, such as Takuya Kimura of SMAP. Men are also noted as often aspiring to a neotenic look.

===Products===
The concept of &quot;kawaii&quot; has had an influence on a variety of products, including candy, such as Hi-Chew, Koala&#x27;s March, and Hello Panda. Cuteness can be added to products by adding cute features, such as hearts, flowers, stars, and rainbows. Cute elements can be found almost everywhere in Japan, from big business to corner markets and national government, ward, and town offices. Many companies, large and small, use cute mascots to present their wares and services to the public. For example:
* Pikachu, a character from &quot;Pokémon,&quot; adorns the side of ten ANA passenger jets, the Pokémon Jets.
* Asahi Bank used Miffy (Nijntje), a character from a Dutch series of children&#x27;s picture books, on some of its ATM and credit cards.
* The prefectures of Japan, as well as many cities and cultural institutions, have cute mascot characters known as yuru-chara to promote tourism. Kumamon, the Kumamoto Prefecture mascot, and Hikonyan, the city of Hikone mascot, are among the most popular.
* The Japan Post &quot;Yū-Pack&quot; mascot is a stylized mailbox; they also use other cute mascot characters to promote their various services (among them the Postal Savings Bank) and have used many such on postage stamps.
* Some police forces in Japan have their own &quot;moe&quot; mascots, which sometimes adorn the front of kōban (police boxes).
* NHK, the public broadcaster, has its own cute mascots. Domokun, the unique-looking and widely recognized NHK mascot, was introduced in 1998 and quickly took on a life of its own, appearing in Internet memes and fan art around the world.
* Sanrio, the company behind Hello Kitty and other similarly cute characters, runs the Sanrio Puroland theme park in Tokyo, and painted on some EVA Air Airbus A330 jets as well. Sanrio&#x27;s line of more than 50 characters takes in more than $1 billion a year and it remains the most successful company to capitalize on the cute trend.
* Kawaii Future bass, a subgenre of Future bass.

&quot;Cute&quot; can be also used to describe a specific fashion sense of an individual, and generally includes clothing that appears to be made for young children, apart from the size, or clothing that accentuates the cuteness of the individual wearing the clothing. Ruffles and pastel colors are commonly (but not always) featured, and accessories often include toys or bags featuring anime characters.

====Non-&quot;kawaii&quot; imports====
There have been occasions on which popular Western products failed to meet the expectations of &quot;kawaii&quot;, and thus did not do well in the Japanese market. For example, Cabbage Patch Kids dolls did not sell well in Japan, because the Japanese considered their facial features to be &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;grotesque&quot; compared to the flatter and almost featureless faces of characters such as Hello Kitty. Also, the doll Barbie, portraying an adult woman, did not become successful in Japan compared to Takara&#x27;s Licca, a doll that was modeled after an 11-year-old girl.

====Industry====
Kawaii has gradually gone from a small subculture in Japan to an important part of Japanese modern culture as a whole. An overwhelming number of modern items feature kawaii themes, not only in Japan but also worldwide. And characters associated with kawaii are astoundingly popular. &quot;Global cuteness&quot; is reflected in such billion-dollar sellers as &quot;Pokémon&quot; and Hello Kitty. &quot;Fueled by Internet subcultures, Hello Kitty alone has hundreds of entries on eBay, and is selling in more than 30 countries, including Argentina, Bahrain, and Taiwan.&quot;

Japan has become a powerhouse in the kawaii industry and images of Doraemon, Hello Kitty, Pikachu, Sailor Moon, and Hamtaro are popular in mobile phone accessories. However, Professor Tian Shenliang says that Japan&#x27;s future is dependent on how much of an impact kawaii brings to humanity.

The Japanese Foreign Ministry has also recognized the power of cute merchandise and sent three 18-year-old women overseas in 2018 in the hopes of spreading Japanese culture around the world. The women dress in uniforms and maid costumes that are commonplace in Japan.

Kawaii manga and magazines have brought tremendous profit to the Japanese press industry. Moreover, the worldwide revenue from the computer game and its merchandising peripherals are closing in on $5 billion, according to a Nintendo press release titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Pokémon Planet&quot;.

==Influence upon other cultures==
In recent years, Kawaii products have gained popularity beyond the borders of Japan in other East and Southeast Asian countries and are additionally becoming more popular in the US among anime and manga fans as well as others influenced by Japanese culture. Cute merchandise and products are especially popular in other parts of East Asia, such as mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea, as well as Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Sebastian Masuda, owner of 6%DOKIDOKI and a global advocate for kawaii influence, takes the quality from Harajuku to Western markets in his stores and artwork. The underlying belief of this Japanese designer is that &quot;kawaii&quot; actually saves the world. The infusion of kawaii into other world markets and cultures is achieved by introducing kawaii via modern art; audio, visual, and written media; and the fashion trends of Japanese youth, especially in high school girls.

Japanese kawaii seemingly operates as a center of global popularity due to its association with making cultural productions and consumer products &quot;cute&quot;. This mindset pursues a global market, giving rise to numerous applications and interpretations in other cultures.

The dissemination of Japanese youth fashion and &quot;kawaii culture&quot; is usually associated with the Western society and trends set by designers borrowed or taken from Japan. With the emergence of China, South Korea and Singapore as global economic centers, the Kawaii merchandise and product popularity has shifted back to the East. In these East Asian and Southeast Asian markets, the kawaii concept takes on various forms and different types of presentation depending on the target audience.

=== In East Asia and Southeast Asia ===
Taiwanese culture, the government in particular, has embraced and elevated kawaii to a new level of social consciousness. The introduction of the A-Bian doll was seen as the development of a symbol to advance democracy and assist in constructing a collective imagination and national identity for Taiwanese people. The A-Bian dolls are kawaii likeness of sports figure, famous individuals, and now political figures that use kawaii images as a means of self-promotion and potential votes. The creation of the A-Bian doll has allowed Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian staffers to create a new culture where the &quot;kawaii&quot; image of a politician can be used to mobilize support and gain election votes.

Japanese popular &quot;kawaii culture&quot; has had an effect on Singaporean youth. The emergence of Japanese culture can be traced back to the mid-1980s when Japan became one of the economic powers in the world. Kawaii has developed from a few children&#x27;s television shows to an Internet sensation. Japanese media is used so abundantly in Singapore that youths are more likely to imitate the fashion of their Japanese idols, learn the Japanese language, and continue purchasing Japanese oriented merchandise.

The East Asian countries including China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Thailand either produce kawaii items for international consumption or have websites that cater for kawaii as part of the youth culture in their country. Kawaii has taken on a life of its own, spawning the formation of kawaii websites, kawaii home pages, kawaii browser themes and finally, kawaii social networking pages. While Japan is the origin and Mecca of all things kawaii, artists and businesses around the world are imitating the kawaii theme.

Kawaii has truly become &quot;greater&quot; than itself. The interconnectedness of today&#x27;s world via the Internet has taken kawaii to new heights of exposure and acceptance, producing a kawaii &quot;movement&quot;.

The Kawaii concept has become something of a global phenomenon. The aesthetic cuteness of Japan is very appealing to people globally. Things like Sanrio, Pusheen, Gudetama and more are some popular kawaii things. The wide popularity of Japanese kawaii is often credited with it being &quot;culturally odorless&quot;. The elimination of exoticism and national branding has helped kawaii to reach numerous target audiences and span every culture, class, and gender group. The palatable characteristics of kawaii have made it a global hit, resulting in Japan&#x27;s global image shifting from being known for austere rock gardens to being known for &quot;cute-worship&quot;.

In 2014, the &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; in the United Kingdom entered &quot;kawaii&quot; into its then latest edition, defining it as a &quot;Japanese artistic and cultural style that emphasizes the quality of cuteness, using bright colors and characters with a childlike appearance&quot;.

== Criticism ==
===Academic social critiques===
In his book &quot;The Power of Cute&quot;, philosophy professor Simon May talks about the 180 degree turn in Japan&#x27;s history, from the violence of war to &quot;kawaii&quot; starting around the 1970s, in the works of artists like Takashi Murakami, amongst others. By 1992, &quot;kawaii&quot; was seen as &quot;the most widely used, widely loved, habitual word in modern living Japanese.&quot; Since then, there has been some criticism surrounding &quot;kawaii&quot; and the expectations of it in Japanese culture. Natalia Konstantinovskaia, in her article &quot;Being Kawaii in Japan&quot;, says that based on the increasing ratio of young Japanese girls that view themselves as &quot;kawaii&quot;, there is a possibility that &quot;from early childhood, Japanese people are socialized into the expectation that women must be &quot;kawaii.&quot;&quot; The idea of &quot;kawaii&quot; can be tricky to balance – if a woman&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;kawaii&quot; seems to have gone too far, she is then labeled as &quot;burikko&quot;, &quot;a woman who plays bogus innocence.&quot; In the article &quot;Embodied Kawaii: Girls&#x27; voices in J-pop&quot;, contemporary music researchers argue that female J-pop singers are expected to be recognizable by their outfits, voice, and mannerisms as &quot;kawaii&quot; – young and cute. Any woman who becomes a J-pop icon must stay &quot;kawaii&quot;, or keep her girlishness, rather than being perceived as a woman, even if she is over 18.

===Superficial charm===
Japanese women who feign kawaii behaviors (e.g., high-pitched voice, squealing giggles) that could be viewed as forced or inauthentic are called &quot;burikko&quot; and this is considered superficial charm. The neologism developed in the 1980s, perhaps originated by comedian .

<text>John Michael Hayes (11 May 1919 – 19 November 2008) was an American screenwriter, who wrote four of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s films in the 1950s.

==Early life and education==
Hayes was born in Worcester, Massachusetts to John Michael Hayes Sr. and Ellen Mabel Hayes. Hayes Sr. was a tool and die maker but had performed as a song and dance man on the Keith-Orpheum vaudeville circuit earlier in life.

As a child, Hayes missed much of his school career from second grade through fifth grade due to ear infections. During that time away from school, he discovered a love of reading. In junior high school, he became a staff writer on &quot;The Spectator&quot;, the school newspaper, and at age 16, he wrote for the high school yearbook as well as editing a Boy Scout weekly, &quot;The Eagle Trail&quot;. His work brought him to the attention of Worcester&#x27;s &quot;Evening Gazette&quot;, and Hayes began penning articles about Boy Scout activities for the paper.

Later stints with the &quot;Worcester Telegram&quot; and a profile in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; led to a job with the Associated Press. Working diligently, Hayes managed to amass enough money to attend Massachusetts State College.

==Career==
===Radio===
At college, Hayes became interested in radio and won a contest to write radio stories for Crosley Corporation in Cincinnati, Ohio. Following his stint with the U.S. Army Special Services division during World War II, Hayes moved to California and resumed his radio career. In California, Hayes wrote for various radio comedies and dramas, including &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot;, &quot;Alias Jane Doe&quot;, &quot;Inner Sanctum Mysteries&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, &quot;Sweeney and March&quot;, &quot;Suspense (radio drama)&quot;, &quot;Twelve Players&quot; and &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;.

===Films===
His success in radio led to an invitation from Universal-International Pictures to write screenplays. His first screen credit was for &quot;Redball Express&quot; in 1952. Much of Hayes&#x27;s career was spent writing screenplays for glossy, big-budget melodramas like &quot;Torch Song&quot; with Joan Crawford, &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor, &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; with Carroll Baker, and &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; with Susan Hayward, Mike Connors and Bette Davis. His adaptation of Grace Metalious&#x27;s steamy bestseller, &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, earned him an Academy Award nomination.

Hayes collaborated with director Alfred Hitchcock on four films: &quot;Rear Window&quot; (for which he won an Edgar Award and an Oscar nomination), &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;. Their first collaboration, &quot;Rear Window&quot;, is considered by many critics to be one of Hitchcock&#x27;s best and most thrilling pictures. &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, a remake of Hitchcock&#x27;s 1934 film of the same name, became one of the most financially successful films of its year of release. The pair parted company forever after that film.

After several years of retirement, Hayes resurfaced to co-write director Charles Haid&#x27;s family adventure drama &quot;Iron Will&quot;, starring Kevin Spacey, in 1994. He taught film writing at Dartmouth College until he retired in 2000.

In 2001, Hayes&#x27; collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock was the subject of the book &quot;Writing with Hitchcock&quot; by Steven DeRosa, which gave a full account of Hayes&#x27;s four film collaboration with the director. In 2004, Hayes was the recipient of the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s highest honor, the Screen Laurel Award. Hayes died of natural causes on November 19, 2008 in Hanover, New Hampshire. A movie based upon &quot;Writing with Hitchcock&quot; is currently in development and a new edition was published in 2011 containing additional material.

<doc id="255720" wikidata="Q827137" url="?curid=255720" title="Metaphysical poets">
<text>The term Metaphysical poets was coined by the critic Samuel Johnson to describe a loose group of 17th-century English poets whose work was characterised by the inventive use of conceits, and by a greater emphasis on the spoken rather than lyrical quality of their verse. These poets were not formally affiliated and few were highly regarded until 20th century attention established their importance.

Given the lack of coherence as a movement, and the diversity of style among poets, it has been suggested that calling them Baroque poets after their era might be more useful. Once the Metaphysical style was established, however, it was occasionally adopted by other and especially younger poets to fit appropriate circumstances.

==Origin of the name==
In the chapter on Abraham Cowley in his &quot;Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets&quot; (1779–81), Samuel Johnson refers to the beginning of the 17th century in which there &quot;appeared a race of writers that may be termed the metaphysical poets&quot;. This does not necessarily imply that he intended &quot;metaphysical&quot; to be used in its true sense, in that he was probably referring to a witticism of John Dryden, who said of John Donne:
He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires, but in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softnesses of love. In this...Mr. Cowley has copied him to a fault.

Probably the only writer before Dryden to speak of the new style of poetry was Drummond of Hawthornden, who in an undated letter from the 1630s made the charge that &quot;some men of late, transformers of everything, consulted upon her reformation, and endeavoured to abstract her to metaphysical ideas and scholastical quiddities, denuding her of her own habits, and those ornaments with which she hath amused the world some thousand years&quot;.

==Criticism==
===The Augustans===
Johnson&#x27;s assessment of &quot;metaphysical poetry&quot; was not at all flattering:
The metaphysical poets were men of learning, and, to show their learning was their whole endeavour; but, unluckily resolving to show it in rhyme, instead of writing poetry, they only wrote verses, and, very often, such verses as stood the trial of the finger better than of the ear; for the modulation was so imperfect, that they were only found to be verses by counting the syllables... The most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together; nature and art are ransacked for illustrations, comparisons, and allusions; their learning instructs, and their subtilty surprises; but the reader commonly thinks his improvement dearly bought, and, though he sometimes admires, is seldom pleased.

Johnson was repeating the disapproval of earlier critics who upheld the rival canons of Augustan poetry, for though Johnson may have given the Metaphysical &quot;school&quot; the name by which it is now known, he was far from being the first to condemn 17th-century poetic usage of conceit and word-play. John Dryden had already satirised the Baroque taste for them in his &quot;Mac Flecknoe&quot; and Joseph Addison, in quoting him, singled out the poetry of George Herbert as providing a flagrant example.

===20th-century recognition===
During the course of the 1920s, T.S. Eliot did much to establish the importance of the Metaphysical school, both through his critical writing and by applying their method in his own work. By 1961 A. Alvarez was commenting that &quot;it may perhaps be a little late in the day to be writing about the Metaphysicals. The great vogue for Donne passed with the passing of the Anglo-American experimental movement in modern poetry.&quot;

A further two decades later, a hostile view was expressed that emphasis on their importance had been an attempt by Eliot and his followers to impose a &quot;high Anglican and royalist literary history&quot; on 17th-century English poetry. But Colin Burrow&#x27;s dissenting opinion, in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, is that the term &#x27;Metaphysical poets&#x27; still retains some value. For one thing, Donne&#x27;s poetry had considerable influence on subsequent poets, who emulated his style. And there are several instances in which 17th-century poets used the word &#x27;metaphysical&#x27; in their work, meaning that Samuel Johnson&#x27;s description has some foundation in the usage of the previous century. However, the term does isolate the English poets from those who shared similar stylistic traits in Europe and America. Since the 1960s, therefore, it has been argued that gathering all of these under the heading of Baroque poets would be more helpfully inclusive.

==Defining the canon==
There is no scholarly consensus regarding which English poets or poems fit within the Metaphysical genre. In his initial use of the term, Johnson quoted just three poets: Abraham Cowley, John Donne, and John Cleveland. Colin Burrow later singled out John Donne, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Andrew Marvell, and Richard Crashaw as &#x27;central figures&#x27;, while naming many more, all or part of whose work has been identified as sharing its characteristics.

Two key anthologists in particular were responsible for identifying common stylistic traits among 17th-century poets. Herbert Grierson&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysical Lyrics and Poems of the Seventeenth Century&quot; (1921) was important in defining the Metaphysical canon. In addition, Helen Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysical Poets&quot; (1957) included &#x27;proto-metaphysical&#x27; writers such as William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Raleigh and, extending into the Restoration, brought in Edmund Waller and Rochester. While comprehensive, her selection, as Burrow remarks, so dilutes the style as to make it &quot;virtually coextensive with seventeenth-century poetry&quot;.

Late additions to the Metaphysical canon have included sacred poets of both England and America who had been virtually unknown for centuries. John Norris was better known as a Platonist philosopher. Thomas Traherne&#x27;s poetry remained unpublished until the start of the 20th century. The work of Edward Taylor, who is now counted as the outstanding English-language poet of North America, was only discovered in 1937.

==A sense of community==
Johnson&#x27;s definition of the Metaphysical poets was that of a hostile critic looking back at the style of the previous century. In 1958 Alvarez proposed an alternative approach in a series of lectures eventually published as &quot;The School of Donne&quot;. This was to look at the practice and self-definition of the circle of friends about Donne, who were the recipients of many of his verse letters. They were a group of some fifteen young professionals with an interest in poetry, many of them poets themselves although, like Donne for much of his life, few of them published their work. Instead, copies were circulated in manuscript among them. Uncertain ascriptions resulted in some poems from their fraternity being ascribed to Donne by later editors.
A younger second generation was a close-knit group of courtiers, some of them with family or professional ties to Donne&#x27;s circle, who initially borrowed Donne&#x27;s manner to cultivate wit. Among them were Lord Herbert of Cherbury and his brother George, whose mother Magdalen was another recipient of verse letters by Donne. Eventually George Herbert, Henry Vaughan and Richard Crashaw, all of whom knew each other, took up the religious life and extended their formerly secular approach into this new area. A later generation of Metaphysical poets, writing during the Commonwealth, became increasingly more formulaic and lacking in vitality. These included Cleveland and his imitators as well as such transitional figures as Cowley and Marvell.

What all had in common, according to Alvarez, was esteem, not for metaphysics but for intelligence. Johnson&#x27;s remark that &quot;To write on their plan it was at least necessary to read and think&quot; only echoed its recognition a century and a half before in the many tributes paid to Donne on his death. For example, Jasper Mayne&#x27;s comment that for the fellow readers of his work, &quot;Wee are thought wits, when &#x27;tis understood&quot;. Coupled with it went a vigorous sense of the speaking voice. It begins with the rough versification of the satires written by Donne and others in his circle such as Everard Gilpin and John Roe. Later it modulates into the thoughtful religious poems of the next generation with their exclamatory or conversational openings and their sense of the mind playing over the subject and examining it from all sides. Helen Gardner too had noted the dramatic quality of this poetry as a personal address of argument and persuasion, whether talking to a physical lover, to God, to Christ&#x27;s mother Mary, or to a congregation of believers.

===Elegists===
A different approach to defining the community of readers is to survey who speaks of whom, and in what manner, in their poetry. On the death of Donne, it is natural that his friend Edward Herbert should write him an elegy full of high-flown and exaggerated Metaphysical logic. In a similar way, Abraham Cowley marks the deaths of Crashaw and of another member of Donne&#x27;s literary circle, Henry Wotton. Here, however, though Cowley acknowledges Crashaw briefly as a writer (&quot;Poet and saint&quot;), his governing focus is on how Crashaw&#x27;s goodness transcended his change of religion. The elegy is as much an exercise in a special application of logic as was Edward Herbert&#x27;s on Donne. Henry Wotton, on the other hand, is not remembered as a writer at all, but instead for his public career. The conjunction of his learning and role as ambassador becomes the extended metaphor on which the poem&#x27;s tribute turns.

Twelve &quot;Elegies upon the Author&quot; accompanied the posthumous first collected edition of Donne&#x27;s work, &quot;Poems by J.D. with elegies of the author’s death&quot; (1633), and were reprinted in subsequent editions over the course of the next two centuries. Though the poems were often cast in a suitably Metaphysical style, half were written by fellow clergymen, few of whom are remembered for their poetry. Among those who are, were Henry King and Jasper Mayne, who was soon to quit authorship for clerical orders. Bishop Richard Corbet&#x27;s poetry writing was also nearly over by now and he contributed only a humorous squib. Other churchmen included Henry Valentine (fl 1600–1650), Edward Hyde (1607–1659) and Richard Busby. Two poets, Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland and Thomas Carew, who were joined in the 1635 edition by Sidney Godolphin, had links with the heterodox Great Tew Circle. They also served as courtiers, as did another contributor, Endymion Porter. In addition, Carew had been in the service of Edward Herbert.

Isaac Walton&#x27;s link with Donne&#x27;s circle was more tangential. He had friends within the Great Tew Circle but at the time of his elegy was working as a researcher for Henry Wotton, who intended writing a life of the poet. This project Walton inherited after his death, publishing it under his own name in 1640; it was followed by a life of Wotton himself that prefaced the collection of Wotton&#x27;s works in 1651. A life of George Herbert followed them in 1670. The links between Donne&#x27;s elegists were thus of a different order from those between Donne and his circle of friends, often no more than professional acquaintanceship. And once the poetic style had been launched, its tone and approach remained available as a model for later writers who might not necessarily commit themselves so wholly to it.

==Characteristics==

===Free from former artificial styles===
Grierson attempted to characterise the main traits of Metaphysical poetry in the introduction to his anthology. For him it begins with a break with the formerly artificial style of their antecedents to one free from poetic diction or conventions. Johnson acknowledged as much in pointing out that their style was not to be achieved &quot;by descriptions copied from descriptions, by imitations borrowed from imitations, by traditional imagery and hereditary similes&quot;.

===European Baroque influences, including use of conceits===
Another characteristic singled out by Grierson is the Baroque European dimension of the poetry, its &quot;fantastic conceits and hyperboles which was the fashion throughout Europe&quot;. Again Johnson had been partly before him in describing the style as &quot;borrowed from Marino and his followers&quot;. It was from the use of conceits particularly that the writing of these European counterparts was known, &quot;Concettismo&quot; in Italian, &quot;Conceptismo&quot; in Spanish. In fact Crashaw had made several translations from Marino. Grierson noted in addition that the slightly older poet, Robert Southwell (who is included in Gardner&#x27;s anthology as a precursor), had learned from the antithetical, conceited style of Italian poetry and knew Spanish as well.

The European dimension of the Catholic poets Crashaw and Southwell has been commented on by others. In the opinion of one critic of the 1960s, defining the extent of the Baroque style in 17th-century English poetry &quot;may even be said to have taken the place of the earlier discussion of the metaphysical&quot;. Southwell counts as a notable pioneer of the style, in part because his formative years were spent outside England. And the circumstance that Crashaw&#x27;s later life was also spent outside England contributed to making him, in the eyes of Mario Praz, &quot;the greatest exponent of the Baroque style in any language&quot;.

Crashaw is frequently cited by Harold Segel when typifying the characteristics of &quot;The Baroque Poem&quot;, but he goes on to compare the work of several other Metaphysical poets to their counterparts in both Western and Eastern Europe. The use of conceits was common not only across the Continent, but also elsewhere in England among the Cavalier poets, including such elegists of Donne as Carew and Godolphin. As an example of the rhetorical way in which various forms of repetition accumulate in creating a tension, only relieved by their resolution at the end of the poem, Segel instances the English work of Henry King as well as Ernst Christoph Homburg&#x27;s in German and Jan Andrzej Morsztyn&#x27;s in Polish. In addition, Marvell&#x27;s &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot; is given as a famous example of the use of hyperbole common to many other Metaphysical poets and typical of the Baroque style too.

===Wordplay and wit===

The way George Herbert and other English poets &quot;torture one poor word ten thousand ways&quot;, in Dryden&#x27;s phrase, finds its counterpart in a poem like &quot;Constantijn Huygens’ &quot;Sondagh&quot; (Sunday) with its verbal variations on the word &#x27;sun&#x27;. Wordplay on this scale was not confined to Metaphysical poets, moreover, but can be found in the multiple meanings of &#x27;will&#x27; that occur in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Sonnet 135&quot;. and of &#x27;sense&#x27; in John Davies’ &quot;That the Soul is more than a Perfection or Reflection of the Sense&quot;. Such rhetorical devices are common in Baroque writing and frequently used by poets not generally identified with the Metaphysical style.

Another striking example occurs in Baroque poems celebrating &quot;black beauty&quot;, built on the opposition between the norm of feminine beauty and instances that challenge that commonplace. There are examples in sonnets by Philip Sidney, where the key contrast is between &#x27;black&#x27; and &#x27;bright&#x27;; by Shakespeare, contrasting &#x27;black&#x27; and various meanings of &#x27;fair&#x27;; and by Edward Herbert, where black, dark and night contrast with light, bright and spark. Black hair and eyes are the subject in the English examples, while generally it is the colour of the skin with which Romance poets deal in much the same paradoxical style. Examples include Edward Herbert&#x27;s &quot;La Gialletta Gallante or The sun-burn&#x27;d exotic Beauty&quot; and Marino&#x27;s &quot;La Bella Schiave&quot; (The Beautiful Slave). Still more dramatically, Luis de Góngora&#x27;s &quot;En la fiesta del Santísimo Sacramento&quot; (At the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament) introduces a creole dialogue between two black women concerning the nature of their beauty.

Much of this display of wit hinges upon enduring literary conventions and is only distinguished as belonging to this or that school by the mode of treatment. But English writing goes further by employing ideas and images derived from contemporary scientific or geographical discoveries to examine religious and moral questions, often with an element of casuistry. Bringing greater depth and a more thoughtful quality to their poetry, such features distinguish the work of the Metaphysical poets from the more playful and decorative use of the Baroque style among their contemporaries.

===Platonic influence===
Ideas of Platonic love had earlier played their part in the love poetry of others, often to be ridiculed there, although Edward Herbert and Abraham Cowley took the theme of &quot;Platonic Love&quot; more seriously in their poems with that title.

In the poetry of Henry Vaughan, as in that of another of the late discoveries, Thomas Traherne, Neo-Platonic concepts played an important part and contributed to some striking poems dealing with the soul&#x27;s remembrance of perfect beauty in the eternal realm and its spiritual influence.

==Stylistic echoes==
Long before it was so-named, the Metaphysical poetic approach was an available model for others outside the interlinking networks of 17th century writers, especially young men who had yet to settle for a particular voice. The poems written by John Milton while still at university are a case in point and include some that were among his earliest published work, well before their inclusion in his &quot;Poems&quot; of 1645. His &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot; (1629) and &quot;On Shakespear&quot; (1630) appear in Grierson&#x27;s anthology; the latter poem and &quot;On the University Carrier&quot; (1631) appear in Gardner&#x27;s too. It may be remembered also that at the time Milton composed these, the slightly younger John Cleveland was a fellow student at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, on whom the influence of the Metaphysical style was more lasting.

In Milton&#x27;s case, there is an understandable difference in the way he matched his style to his subjects. For the &#x27;Nativity Ode&#x27; and commendatory poem on Shakespeare he deployed Baroque conceits, while his two poems on the carrier Thomas Hobson were a succession of high-spirited paradoxes. What was then titled &quot;An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare&quot; was included anonymously among the poems prefacing the second folio publication of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in 1632. The poems on Thomas Hobson were anthologised in collections titled &quot;A Banquet of Jests&quot; (1640, reprinted 1657) and &quot;Wit Restor’d&quot; (1685), bracketing both the 1645 and 1673 poetry collections published during Milton&#x27;s lifetime.

The start of John Dryden&#x27;s writing career coincided with the period when Cleveland, Cowley and Marvell were first breaking into publication. He had yet to enter university when he contributed a poem on the death of Henry Lord Hastings to the many other tributes published in &quot;Lachrymae Musarum&quot; (1649). It is typified by astronomical imagery, paradox, Baroque hyperbole, play with learned vocabulary (&quot;an universal metampsychosis&quot;), and irregular versification which includes frequent enjambment. The poem has been cited as manifesting &quot;the extremes of the metaphysical style&quot;, but in this it sits well with others there that are like it: John Denham&#x27;s &quot;Elegy on the death of Henry Lord Hastings&quot;, for example, or Marvell&#x27;s rather smoother &quot;Upon the death of the Lord Hastings&quot;. The several correspondences among the poems there are sometimes explained as the result of the book&#x27;s making a covert Royalist statement. In the political circumstances following the recent beheading of the king, it was wise to dissemble grief for him while mourning another under the obscure and closely wrought arguments typical of the Metaphysical style.

The choice of style by the young Milton and the young Dryden can therefore be explained in part as contextual. Both went on to develop radically different ways of writing; neither could be counted as potentially Metaphysical poets. Nor could Alexander Pope, yet his early poetry evidences an interest in his Metaphysical forebears. Among his juvenilia appear imitations of Cowley. As a young man he began work on adapting Donne&#x27;s second satire, to which he had added the fourth satire too by 1735. Pope also wrote his &quot;Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady&quot; (1717) while still young, introducing into it a string of Metaphysical conceits in the lines beginning &quot;Most souls, &#x27;tis true, but peep out once an age&quot; which in part echo a passage from Donne&#x27;s &quot;Second Anniversary&quot;. By the time Pope wrote this, the vogue for the Metaphysical style was over and a new orthodoxy had taken its place, of which the rewriting of Donne&#x27;s satires was one expression. Nevertheless, Johnson&#x27;s dismissal of the &#x27;school&#x27; was still in the future and at the start of the 18th century allusions to their work struck an answering chord in readers.

<text>Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a standard plain text format for recording chess games (both the moves and related data), which can be read by humans and is also supported by most chess software.
==History==
PGN was devised around 1993, by Steven J. Edwards, and was first popularized and specified via the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.chess.

==Usage==
PGN is structured &quot;for easy reading and writing by human users and for easy parsing and generation by computer programs.&quot; The chess moves themselves are given in algebraic chess notation using English initials for the pieces. The filename extension is codice_1.

There are two formats in the PGN specification, the &quot;import&quot; format and the &quot;export&quot; format. The import format describes data that may have been prepared by hand, and is intentionally lax; a program that can read PGN data should be able to handle the somewhat lax import format. The export format is rather strict and describes data prepared under program control, similar to a pretty printed source program reformatted by a compiler. The export format representations generated by different programs on the same computer should be exactly equivalent, byte for byte.

PGN text begins with a set of &quot;tag pairs&quot; (a tag name and its value), followed by the &quot;movetext&quot; (chess moves with optional commentary).

=== Tag pairs ===

Tag pairs begin with an initial left bracket , followed by the name of the tag in plain ASCII text. The tag value is enclosed in double-quotes, and the tag is then terminated with a closing right bracket . A quote inside a tag value is represented by the backslash immediately followed by a quote. A backslash inside a tag value is represented by two adjacent backslashes. There are no special control codes involving escape characters, or carriage returns, and linefeeds to separate the fields, and superfluous embedded spaces are usually skipped when parsing.

==== Seven Tag Roster ====
PGN data for archival storage is required to provide seven tag pairs – together known as the &quot;Seven Tag Roster&quot;. In export format, these tag pairs must appear before any other tag pairs and in this order:

==== Optional tag pairs ====
The standard allows for other optional tag pairs. The more common ones include:

=== Movetext ===
The movetext describes the actual moves of the game. This includes move number indicators (numbers followed by either one or three periods; one if the next move is White&#x27;s move, three if the next move is Black&#x27;s move) and movetext in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).

For most moves the SAN consists of the letter abbreviation for the piece, an codice_2 if there is a capture, and the two-character algebraic name of the final square the piece moved to. The letter abbreviations are codice_3 (king), codice_4 (queen), codice_5 (rook), codice_6 (bishop), and codice_7 (knight). The pawn is given an empty abbreviation in SAN movetext, but in other contexts the abbreviation codice_8 is used. The algebraic name of any square is as per usual algebraic chess notation; from white&#x27;s perspective, the leftmost square closest to white is codice_9, the rightmost square closest to the white is codice_10, and the rightmost (from white&#x27;s perspective) square closest to black side is codice_11.

In a few cases, a more detailed representation is needed to resolve ambiguity; if so, the piece&#x27;s file letter, numerical rank, or the exact square is inserted after the moving piece&#x27;s name (in that order of preference). Thus, codice_12 specifies that the knight originally on the g-file moves to e2.

SAN kingside castling is indicated by the sequence codice_13; queenside castling is indicated by the sequence codice_14 (note that these are capital Os, not zeroes, contrary to the FIDE standard for notation). Pawn promotions are notated by appending codice_15 to the destination square, followed by the piece the pawn is promoted to. For example: codice_16. If the move is a checking move, 
codice_17 is also appended; if the move is a checkmating move, codice_18 is appended instead. For example: codice_19.

An annotator who wishes to suggest alternative moves to those actually played in the game may insert variations enclosed in parentheses. They may also comment on the game by inserting Numeric Annotation Glyphs (NAGs) into the movetext. Each NAG reflects a subjective impression of the move preceding the NAG or of the resultant position.

If the game result is anything other than codice_20, the result is repeated at the end of the movetext.

=== Comments ===
Comments are inserted by either a codice_21 (a comment that continues to the end of the line) or a codice_22 (which continues until a codice_23). Comments do not nest.

=== Example ===
Here is the PGN format of the 29th game of the 1992 match played in Yugoslavia between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky:
=== Handling chess variants ===
Many chess variants can be recorded using PGN, provided the names of the pieces can be limited to one character, usually a letter and not a number. They are typically noted with a tag named &quot;Variant&quot; giving the name of the rules. The term &quot;Variation&quot; must be avoided, as that refers to the name of an opening variation. Note that traditional chess programs can only handle, at most, a few variants. Forsyth-Edwards Notation is used to record the starting position for variants (such as Chess960) which have initial positions other than the orthodox chess initial position.

==Numeric Annotation Glyphs==
Numeric Annotation Glyphs or NAGs are used to annotate chess games when using a computer, typically providing an assessment of a chess move or a chess position. NAGs exist to indicate a simple annotation in a language independent manner.
NAGs were first formally documented in 1994 by Steven J. Edwards in his &quot;Portable Game Notation Specification and Implementation Guide&quot;. Within the PGN specification, 256 NAGs are proposed of which the first 140 are defined; the remainder were reserved for future definition.

A Numeric Annotation Glyph is composed of a dollar sign character (&quot;$&quot;) immediately followed by one or more digit characters. Each NAG then has a specific meaning and often a standard typographical representation. The meanings first defined stemmed from the use of specific typographic symbols when annotators were commenting upon chess games; most especially in Chess Informant publications. The objective was to devise an alternative representation of these symbols which could be incorporated in the simple computer file format proposed as the PGN standard. This mechanism allowed often sophisticated typography to be expressed using the simple ASCII character set.

Since its inception there has been no attempt to further formalise or standardise the meaning of the undefined 116 NAGs although PGN editors, such as ChessPad, have variously used these higher glyphs.

=== Standard NAGs ===

=== Non-standard NAGs ===
=== Notes on tables ===
# Some of the symbols are not rendered by some browsers
# The more exotic symbols used by Chess Informator are often derived from common mathematical typographic symbols; their mathematical meaning rarely has any relevance to their chess meaning
# The entries in the Unicode column are, respectively, the decimal and hexadecimal reference for the character or symbol
# The entries in the HTML column are named HTML entities for representing the symbol or character; the Unicode numeric value can always be used where a specific entity does not exist. For example, the &quot;left right double arrow&quot; ($239) can be represented as either Unicode decimal &amp;#8660; (⇔) or Unicode hexadecimal &amp;#x21D4; (⇔) or HTML &amp;hArr; (⇔). Unless explicitly noted, the Unicode representation can be interpreted as a default.

<text>James Riddle Hoffa (born February 14, 1913 – disappeared July 30, 1975, declared dead July 30, 1982) was an American labor union leader who served as the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) from 1957 until 1971. He is notorious for his alleged ties to organized crime and for his disappearance under mysterious circumstances in 1975.

From an early age, Hoffa was a union activist: he became an important regional figure with the IBT by his mid-20s. By 1952, he was the national vice-president of the IBT and between 1957 and 1971 he was its general president. Hoffa secured the first national agreement for teamsters&#x27; rates in 1964 with the National Master Freight Agreement. He played a major role in the growth and the development of the union, which eventually became the largest by membership in the United States, with over 2.3 million members at its peak, during his terms as its leader.

Hoffa became involved with organized crime from the early years of his Teamsters work, a connection that continued until his disappearance. He was convicted of jury tampering, attempted bribery, conspiracy, along with mail and wire fraud in 1964 in two separate trials. He was imprisoned in 1967 and sentenced to 13 years. 

In mid-1971, he resigned as president of the union as part of a commutation agreement with U.S. president Richard Nixon and was released later that year, but he was barred from union activities until 1980. Hoping to regain support and to return to IBT leadership, he unsuccessfully tried to overturn the order.

Hoffa disappeared on July 30, 1975. He is generally thought to have been murdered by the Mafia, and was declared legally dead in 1982. Hoffa&#x27;s legacy and the circumstances of his disappearance continue to stir debate.

==Early life and family==
Hoffa was born in Brazil, Indiana, on February 14, 1913, to John and Viola (née Riddle) Hoffa. His father, who was of German descent from what is now referred to as the Pennsylvania Dutch, died in 1920 from lung disease when Hoffa was seven years old. His mother was of Irish ancestry. The family moved to Detroit in 1924, where Hoffa was raised and lived for the rest of his life. He left school at the age of 14 and began working full-time manual labor jobs to help support his family.

Hoffa married Josephine Poszywak, an 18-year-old Detroit laundry worker of Polish heritage, in Bowling Green, Ohio, on September 25, 1937. The couple had met six months earlier during a non-unionized laundry workers&#x27; strike action. They had two children: a daughter, Barbara Ann Crancer, and a son, James P. Hoffa. The Hoffas paid $6,800 in 1939 for a modest home in northwestern Detroit. The family later owned a simple summer lakefront cottage in Orion Township, Michigan, north of Detroit.

==Early union activity==
Hoffa began union organizational work at the grassroots level as a teenager through his job with a grocery chain, which paid substandard wages and offered poor working conditions with minimal job security. The workers were displeased with that situation and tried to organize a union to better their wages. Although Hoffa was young, his courage and approachability in that role impressed fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after refusing to work for an abusive shift foreman, Hoffa left the grocery chain, partly because of his union activities. He was then invited to become an organizer with Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit.

==Growth of Teamsters==
The Teamsters, founded in 1903, had 75,000 members in 1933. As a result of Hoffa&#x27;s work with other union leaders, he consolidated local union trucker groups into regional sections and then into a national body, which Hoffa ultimately completed over two decades; membership grew to 170,000 members by 1936, and three years later, to 420,000. The number grew steadily during World War II and in the postwar boom to eventually top a million members by 1951.

The Teamsters organized truck drivers and warehousemen throughout the Midwest and then nationwide. Hoffa played a major role in the union&#x27;s skillful use of &quot;quickie strikes,&quot; secondary boycotts, and other means of leveraging union strength at one company, moves to organize workers at another, and finally to win contract demands at other companies. That process, which took several years starting in the early 1930s, eventually brought the Teamsters to a position of being one of the most powerful unions in the United States.

Trucking unions in that era were heavily influenced by, and in many cases controlled by, elements of organized crime. To unify and expand trucking unions, Hoffa made accommodations and arrangements with many gangsters, beginning in the Detroit area. Organized crime&#x27;s influence on the IBT increased as the union grew.

==Rise to power==

Hoffa worked to defend the Teamsters from raids by other unions, including the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and he extended the Teamsters&#x27; influence in the Midwest from the late 1930s to the late 1940s. Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II by successfully making a case for his union leadership skills being of more value to the nation by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort. Although he never actually worked as a truck driver, he became president of Local 299 in December 1946. He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwards and later advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups.

At the 1952 IBT convention in Los Angeles, Hoffa was selected as national vice-president by incoming president Dave Beck, the successor to Daniel J. Tobin, who had been president since 1907. Hoffa had quelled an internal revolt against Tobin by securing Central States&#x27; regional support for Beck at the convention. In exchange, Beck made Hoffa a vice-president. 

In 1952, a petty criminal living in New York, Marvin Elkind, was assigned by gangster Anthony Salerno to work as Hoffa&#x27;s chauffeur. In a 2008 interview, Elkind said of his four years working as a chauffeur: &quot;Mr. Hoffa was a tremendously intimidating man. This man had no fear at all, of nothing, showed very little emotion, had completely no sense of humour, and was dedicated to the people that belonged to his union. When you drive these people you learn a lot and I’ll tell you why. They don’t know you’re there. You become a piece of the car, just like an extra gear shift or a brake, and they talk.&quot; 

The IBT moved its headquarters from Indianapolis to Washington, DC, taking over a large office building in the capital in 1955. IBT staff was also enlarged, with many lawyers hired to assist with contract negotiations. Following his 1952 election as vice-president, Hoffa began spending more of his time away from Detroit, either in Washington or traveling around the country for his expanded responsibilities. Hoffa&#x27;s personal lawyer was Bill Bufalino.

==Teamsters presidency==
Hoffa took over the presidency of the Teamsters in 1957, at the convention in Miami Beach, Florida. Beck, his predecessor, had appeared before the John L. McClellan-led US Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor or Management Field in March 1957 and took the Fifth Amendment 140 times. Beck was under indictment when the IBT convention took place and was convicted and imprisoned in a trial for fraud held in Seattle.

===Teamsters expelled from AFL-CIO===
At the 1957 AFL-CIO convention, held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, union members voted nearly five to one to expel the IBT. Vice-president Walter Reuther led the fight to oust the IBT on charges of Hoffa&#x27;s corrupt leadership. President George Meany gave an emotional speech, advocating the removal of the IBT and stating that he could only agree to further affiliation of the Teamsters if they dismissed Hoffa as their president. Meany demanded a response from Hoffa, who replied through the press, &quot;We&#x27;ll see.&quot; At the time, the IBT was bringing in over $750,000 annually to the AFL-CIO.

===National Master Freight Agreement===
Following his re-election as president in 1961, Hoffa worked to expand the union. In 1964, he succeeded in bringing virtually all over-the-road truck drivers in North America under a single National Master Freight Agreement, which may have been his biggest achievement in a lifetime of union activity. Hoffa then tried to bring airline workers and other transport employees into the union, with limited success. He then faced immense personal strain as he was under investigation, on trial, launching appeals of convictions, or imprisoned for virtually all of the 1960s.

Hoffa was re-elected without opposition to a third five-year term as president of the IBT, despite having been convicted of jury tampering and mail fraud in court verdicts that were stayed pending review on appeal. Delegates in Miami Beach also elected Frank Fitzsimmons as first vice president, who would become president &quot;if Hoffa has to serve a jail term.&quot;

==Criminal charges==

Hoffa faced major criminal investigations in 1957, as a result of the McClellan Committee. On March 14, 1957, Hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe an aide to the Select Committee. Hoffa denied the charges (and was later acquitted), but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks. When John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960, he appointed his younger brother Robert as Attorney General. Robert Kennedy had been frustrated in earlier attempts to convict Hoffa, while working as counsel to the McClellan subcommittee. As attorney general from 1961, Kennedy pursued a strong attack on organized crime and he carried on with a so-called &quot;Get Hoffa&quot; squad of prosecutors and investigators.

===Prison sentences===

In May 1963, Hoffa was indicted for jury tampering in Tennessee, charged with the attempted bribery of a grand juror during his 1962 conspiracy trial in Nashville. Hoffa was convicted on March 4, 1964, and subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine. While on bail during his appeal, Hoffa was convicted in a second trial held in Chicago, on July 26, 1964, on one count of conspiracy and three counts of mail and wire fraud for improper use of the Teamsters&#x27; pension fund, and sentenced to five years in prison.

Hoffa spent the next three years unsuccessfully appealing his 1964 convictions. Appeals filed by his chief counsel, defense attorney Morris Shenker, reached the U.S. Supreme Court. He began serving his aggregate prison sentence of 13 years (eight years for bribery, five years for fraud) on March 7, 1967, at the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania.

===Appointment of Fitzsimmons as caretaker president===

When Hoffa entered prison, Frank Fitzsimmons was named acting president of the union, and Hoffa planned to run the union from prison through Fitzsimmons. Fitzsimmons was a Hoffa loyalist, fellow Detroit resident, and a longtime member of Teamsters Local 299, who owed his own high position in large part to Hoffa&#x27;s influence. Despite this, Fitzsimmons soon distanced himself from Hoffa&#x27;s influence and control after 1967, to Hoffa&#x27;s displeasure. Fitzsimmons also decentralized power somewhat within the IBT&#x27;s administration structure, forgoing much of the control Hoffa took advantage of as union president. While still in prison, Hoffa resigned as Teamsters president on June 19, 1971, and Fitzsimmons was elected Teamsters president on July 9, 1971.

==After prison==
On December 23, 1971, less than five years into his 13-year sentence, Hoffa was released from prison when US President Richard Nixon commuted it to time served. As a result of Hoffa&#x27;s previous resignation, he was awarded a $1.75 million lump sum termination benefit by the Teamsters Retirement and Family Protection Plan. That type of pension settlement had never occurred with the Teamsters. The IBT then endorsed Nixon, a Republican, in his presidential re-election bid in 1972. In prior elections, the union had normally supported Democratic nominees, but switched and endorsed Nixon in 1960.

Hoffa regained his freedom, but the commutation from Nixon did not allow Hoffa to &quot;engage in the direct or indirect management of any labor organization&quot; until March 6, 1980. Hoffa contended that he had never agreed to that condition. Hoffa accused senior Nixon administration figures, including Attorney General John N. Mitchell and White House Special Counsel Charles Colson, of depriving him of his rights by imposing that condition. It was suspected that the condition had been imposed upon Hoffa because of requests from the Teamsters&#x27; leadership, but that was denied by Fitzsimmons. By 1973, Hoffa was planning to seize the presidency of the Teamsters again.

Hoffa sued to invalidate the restriction so that he could reassert his power over the Teamsters. John Dean, former White House counsel to Nixon, was among those called upon for depositions in 1974 court proceedings. Dean, who had become famous as a government witness in prosecutions arising from the Watergate scandal by mid-1973, had drafted the clause in 1971 at Nixon&#x27;s request. Hoffa ultimately lost his court battle since the court ruled that Nixon had acted within his powers by imposing the restriction, as it had been based on Hoffa&#x27;s misconduct while he was serving as a Teamsters official.

Hoffa faced immense resistance to his re-establishment of power from many corners and had lost much of his earlier support even in the Detroit area. As a result, he intended to begin his comeback at the local level with Local 299 in Detroit, where he retained some influence. In 1975, Hoffa was working on an autobiography, &quot;&quot;, which was published a few months after his disappearance. He had earlier published a book titled &quot;The Trials of Jimmy Hoffa&quot; (1970).

At the time of his death, Hoffa lived with his family at their summer cottage in the village of Lake Orion, which was about a half hour drive from the restaurant where he was last seen. His home was located on a multiacre wooded lot on Square Lake. The property had a house with over 2500 square feet, as well as outbuildings.

==Disappearance==
===Prelude===
Hoffa&#x27;s plans to regain the leadership of the union were met with opposition from several members of the Mafia. One of them was Anthony Provenzano, who had been a Teamsters local leader in New Jersey and a national vice-president of the union during Hoffa&#x27;s second term as its president. Provenzano was a &quot;caporegime&quot; in the New York City Genovese crime family. At least two of Provenzano&#x27;s union opponents had been murdered, and others who had spoken out against him had been assaulted.

Provenzano had once been a friend of Hoffa, but he became an enemy after having a reported feud when both were in federal prison at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, in the 1960s. In 1973 and 1974, Hoffa asked him for his support to regain his former position, but Provenzano refused and threatened Hoffa by reportedly saying he would pull out his guts or kidnap his grandchildren. 

Other Mafia figures who became involved were Anthony Giacalone, an alleged kingpin in the Detroit Mafia, and his younger brother, Vito. The FBI believes that they were positioning themselves as &quot;mediators&quot; between Hoffa and Provenzano. The brothers had made three visits to Hoffa&#x27;s home at Lake Orion and one to the Guardian Building law offices. Their avowed purpose in meeting Hoffa was to set up a &quot;peace meeting&quot; between Provenzano and Hoffa. Hoffa&#x27;s son, James, said, &quot;Dad was pushing so hard to get back in office, I was increasingly afraid that the mob would do something about it.&quot; James was convinced that the &quot;peace meeting&quot; was a pretext to Giacalone&#x27;s &quot;setting Dad up&quot; for a hit since Hoffa had been increasingly uneasy each time the Giacalone brothers arrived.

===Events of July 30===
Hoffa disappeared on July 30, 1975, after he had gone to a meeting with Provenzano and Giacalone. The meeting was to take place at 2:00 p.m. at the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Bloomfield Township, a Detroit suburb. The place was known to Hoffa, as it had been the site of the wedding reception of his son James. Hoffa wrote Giacalone&#x27;s initials and the time and location of the meeting in his office calendar: &quot;TG—2 p.m.—Red Fox.&quot;

Hoffa left his Lake Orion home at 1:15 p.m. Before heading to the restaurant, he stopped at the Pontiac office of his close friend Louis Linteau, a former president of Teamsters Local 614 who now ran a limousine service. Linteau and Hoffa had been enemies early in their careers, but eventually became friends. When Hoffa left prison, Linteau had also become Hoffa&#x27;s unofficial appointment secretary and arranged a dinner meeting between Hoffa and the Giacalone brothers on July 26 in which they had informed him of the July 30 meeting. Linteau was out to lunch when Hoffa stopped by. So Hoffa talked to some of the staff present and left a message for Linteau before he left for the Machus Red Fox.

Between 2:15 and 2:30 p.m., an annoyed Hoffa called his wife from a payphone on a post in front of Damman Hardware, directly behind the Machus Red Fox, and complained that Giacalone had not shown up and that he had been stood up. His wife told him she had not heard from anyone. He told her he would be home in Lake Orion by 4:00 p.m. to grill steaks for dinner. Several witnesses saw Hoffa standing by his car and pacing the restaurant&#x27;s parking lot. Two men saw Hoffa, recognized him, and stopped to chat with him briefly and to shake his hand. Hoffa also made a call to Linteau in which he again complained that the men were late. Linteau gave the time as 3:30 p.m., but the FBI suspected that it was earlier, based on the timing of other phone calls from Linteau&#x27;s office from around that time. The FBI estimates that Hoffa left the location without a struggle around 2:45–2:50 p.m. One witness reported seeing Hoffa in the back of a maroon &quot;Lincoln or Mercury&quot; car with three other people.

===Investigation===
At 7 a.m. the next day, Hoffa&#x27;s wife called her son and daughter to say that their father had not come home. At 7:20 a.m., Linteau went to the Machus Red Fox and found Hoffa&#x27;s unlocked car in the parking lot, but there was no sign of Hoffa, nor any indication of what had happened to him. Linteau called the police, who later arrived at the scene. The Michigan State Police were brought in, and the FBI was alerted. At 6 p.m., Hoffa&#x27;s son, James, filed a missing person report. The Hoffa family offered a $200,000 reward for any information about his disappearance.

The primary piece of physical evidence obtained in the investigation was a maroon 1975 Mercury Marquis Brougham, which belonged to Anthony Giacalone&#x27;s son, Joseph. The car had been borrowed earlier that day by Charles &quot;Chuckie&quot; O&#x27;Brien to deliver fish. O&#x27;Brien was Hoffa&#x27;s foster son, although relations between them had soured in the years preceding Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance. Investigators and Hoffa&#x27;s family suspected that O&#x27;Brien had a role in Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance. On August 21, police dogs identified Hoffa&#x27;s scent in the car.

Giacalone and Provenzano, who denied having scheduled a meeting with Hoffa, were found not to have been near the restaurant that afternoon. According to &quot;Time&quot;, Provenzano was seen fraternizing with local union members in Hoboken, although Provenzano told investigators that he was playing cards with Stephen Andretta, Thomas Andretta&#x27;s brother, in Union City, New Jersey the day that Hoffa disappeared. Despite extensive surveillance and bugging, investigators found that the Mafia members were generally unwilling to talk about Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance, even in private. On December 4, 1975, a federal investigator in Detroit testified in court before presiding Judge James Paul Churchill that a witness had identified three New Jersey men as having participated &quot;in the abduction and murder of James R. Hoffa.&quot; The three men were close associates of Provenzano: Thomas Andretta, Salvatore Briguglio, and his brother Gabriel Briguglio.

In October 1975, Michigan Attorney General Frank J. Kelley went to Waterford Township to supervise an unsuccessful expedition to locate and exhume Hoffa&#x27;s remains. The search was triggered by &quot;a tip from an unnamed informer who said a group of Mafiosi wanted Hoffa&#x27;s body found.&quot;

After years of investigation involving numerous law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, officials have not reached a definitive conclusion as to Hoffa&#x27;s fate or who was involved. Hoffa&#x27;s wife, Josephine, died on September 12, 1980, and is interred at White Chapel Memorial Cemetery in Troy, Michigan. On December 9, 1982, Hoffa was declared legally dead as of July 30, 1982, by Oakland County, Michigan Probate Judge Norman R. Barnard.

In 1989, Kenneth Walton, the agent in charge of the FBI&#x27;s Detroit office, told &quot;The Detroit News&quot; that he knew what had happened to Hoffa. &quot;I&#x27;m comfortable I know who did it, but it&#x27;s never going to be prosecuted because we would have to divulge informants, confidential sources.&quot; In 2001, the FBI matched DNA from Hoffa&#x27;s hair, taken from a brush, with a strand of hair found in Joseph Giacalone&#x27;s car, but it is possible that Hoffa had traveled in the car on a different day.

On June 16, 2006, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; published the entire &quot;Hoffex Memo,&quot; a 56-page report prepared by the FBI for a January 1976 briefing on the case at the FBI headquarters in Washington. Although not claiming conclusively to establish the specifics of his disappearance, the memo records a belief that Hoffa was murdered at the behest of organized crime figures, who regarded his efforts to regain power in the Teamsters as a threat to their control of the union&#x27;s pension fund. In the Hoffex Memo it concluded, based on evidence, that Chuckie O&#x27;Brien (who was described by FBI investigators as a &quot;habitual liar&quot;) was driving Joseph Giacalone&#x27;s maroon 1975 Mercury with license TMS-416 on the day of the disappearance and that Hoffa was seated in the right rear seat of the car. His body scent was located by police dogs, and a piece of his hair was recovered from the back seat. A pump action 12-gauge shotgun was seized from the trunk of the car, and numerous .22 and .38 caliber bullets were found in the glove compartment. As of 2021, digs were still periodically conducted in the Detroit area in search of Hoffa&#x27;s body, but a common theory among experts is that the body was cremated.

===Claims and developments===
====Crime historians and investigators====
There is wide agreement among crime historians and investigators that Hoffa was murdered on the order of his enemies in the Mafia. However, key details remain either unknown or unprovable, and this has ensured that no individuals have ever been charged in relation to the case.

In discussing potential motives, both the 1976 Hoffex Memo and scholarship prior to its release focus on Mafia opposition to Hoffa&#x27;s plans to regain the Teamsters&#x27; leadership and the threat Hoffa posed to the Mafia&#x27;s control over the union&#x27;s pension fund. The Hoffex Memo noted that Provenzano was not senior enough to order a Mafia hit, though it did not rule out the possibility that his or someone else&#x27;s personal vendetta against Hoffa was a motive. Scott Burnstein, a crime historian and journalist, argued in 2019 that Provenzano&#x27;s role in the entire case was limited to acting as a lure.

Dan Moldea mentioned the possibility that Hoffa had retaliated against his Mafia opponents by co-operating with investigations against them. The Hoffex Memo includes this as a possible motivation. Vincent Piersante, the state government&#x27;s former chief investigator into the Hoffa case, doubted that Hoffa could have seriously threatened the Mafia in this way, as any incriminating information he knew either would have incriminated himself or concerned crimes that were outside of the statute of limitations. 

Piersante suggested that the killing was accidental, and that the men who were sent to meet Hoffa were only meant to be &quot;insultingly low-level messengers&quot;. He argued that Hoffa had no realistic prospects for a comeback, that the disappearance did not share the usual characteristics of a Mafia hit and that it risked encouraging action against organized crime (as indeed happened). This theory did not gain wide acceptance among criminologists.

In his 1991 book &quot;Hoffa&quot;, Arthur A. Sloane said that the most common theory of FBI investigators was that Russell Bufalino was the mob boss who ordered the murder, and Salvatore &quot;Sally Bugs&quot; Briguglio, his brother Gabriel Briguglio, Thomas Andretta and Charles &quot;Chuckie&quot; O&#x27;Brien were the men who lured Hoffa away from the restaurant. The theory is that O&#x27;Brien was used as an &quot;unwitting dupe&quot; to lure Hoffa away, because Hoffa was suspicious of Provenzano and would not have entered the car unless there was a familiar figure present. 

It is theorized that O&#x27;Brien picked Hoffa up from the Machus Red Fox parking lot, and Hoffa was either killed in the car or driven to an unspecified location to be killed. Keith Corbett, a former US Prosecuting Attorney, has since suggested that O&#x27;Brien would have been considered too unreliable to be entrusted with a role in such a high-profile murder. He instead suggested that Vito &quot;Billy&quot; Giacalone was the familiar figure.

The location of the murder is also unknown, but any violence in the restaurant parking lot would have easily attracted witnesses. Therefore, the Hoffex Memo suspects Hoffa was lured away to a different murder location. James Buccellato, a professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northern Arizona University, suggested in 2017 that it was likely that Hoffa was murdered one mile away from the restaurant at the house of Carlo Licata, the son of the mobster Nick Licata.

Sloane listed a local waste incinerator and a landfill in Jersey City as the possible locations where the body was taken; the latter is also supported by Dan Moldea. Buccellato listed two waste incinerators and a crematorium, all in the Detroit area. He doubted the body had been transported a long distance: &quot;It&#x27;s just not practical.&quot; The Hoffex Memo similarly said: &quot;If the Detroit LCN was used to assist in the disappearance, it is unknown why the body would be transported back to New Jersey when Detroit Organized Crime people have proven in the past that they are capable of taking care of such things.&quot;

====Other accounts and speculation====
In the book &quot;I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank &quot;The Irishman&quot; Sheeran and the Closing of the Case on Jimmy Hoffa&quot; (2004), author Charles Brandt writes that Frank Sheeran, an alleged professional killer for the mob and a longtime friend of Hoffa, confessed to killing him. According to the book, Sheeran claims O&#x27;Brien drove him, Hoffa, and fellow mobster Sal Briguglio to a house in Detroit, where he shot Hoffa twice in the back of the head, although bloodstains found in the Detroit house in which Sheeran claimed the murder had happened were determined not to match Hoffa&#x27;s DNA. The truthfulness of the book, including Sheeran&#x27;s confessions to killing Hoffa, has been disputed by &quot;The Lies of the Irishman&quot;, an article in &quot;Slate&quot; by Bill Tonelli, and &quot;Jimmy Hoffa and &#x27;The Irishman&#x27;: A True Crime Story?&quot; by Harvard Law School Professor Jack Goldsmith, which appeared in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Buccellato doubts that the Mafia would have entrusted an Irish American with this role and also believes that Hoffa would have refused to travel that far from the restaurant.

Hoffa&#x27;s body was rumored to be buried in Giants Stadium. In a 2004 episode of the Discovery Channel show &quot;MythBusters&quot;, &quot;The Hunt for Hoffa&quot;, the locations in the stadium in which Hoffa was rumored to be buried were scanned with a ground-penetrating radar. It was intended to reveal if any disturbances indicated a human body had been buried there, but no trace of any human remains was found. In addition, no human remains were found when Giants Stadium was demolished in 2010.

In one of his jailhouse confessions published in a biography released after his death in 2006, Richard Kuklinski claimed that he was part of a four-man team who kidnapped and murdered Hoffa. Former FBI agent Robert Garrity, who worked on the Hoffa case, dismissed Kuklinski&#x27;s claims as a hoax. Other authorities have also stated that Kuklinski&#x27;s involvement in Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance is unlikely.

In 2012, Roseville, Michigan, police took samples from the ground under a suburban Detroit driveway after a person reported having witnessed the burial of a body there around the time of Hoffa&#x27;s 1975 disappearance. Tests by Michigan State University anthropologists found no evidence of human remains.

In January 2013, the reputed gangster Tony Zerilli, implied that Hoffa was originally buried in a shallow grave, with plans to move his remains later to a second location. Zerilli said the plans were abandoned and Hoffa&#x27;s remains lay in a field in northern Oakland County, Michigan, not far from the restaurant in which he had been last seen. Zerilli denied any responsibility for or association with Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance. On June 17, 2013, investigating the Zerilli information, the FBI was led to a property in Oakland Township, in northern Oakland County, which was owned by Detroit mob boss Jack Tocco. After three days, the FBI called off the dig. No human remains were found, and the case remains open.

Thomas Andretta, who died in 2019, and his brother Stephen, who reportedly died of cancer in 2000, were named by the FBI as suspects. Both were New Jersey Teamsters and reputed Genovese crime family mob associates. The FBI called Thomas Andretta a &quot;trusted associate of Anthony Provenzano; reported to be involved in the disappearance of Hoffa.&quot;

In an April 2019 interview with DJ Vlad, the former Colombo crime family capo Michael Franzese stated that he was certain that Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance had been mob-related. He said he was aware of the location of Hoffa&#x27;s body and of the identity of his shooter, and had tapes that revealed details of his disappearance. When pressed for information on Hoffa&#x27;s body, Franzese said, &quot;I can tell you that it&#x27;s wet, that&#x27;s for sure&quot;, and &quot;Upon good information, again, I think I know who the real shooter was; still alive today, in prison.&quot; In a 2018 interview with Value Entertainment, Franzese also makes the &quot;it&#x27;s wet&quot; claim and adds that &quot;it&#x27;s deep&quot;. He also claims that he has in his possession a recorded tape that &quot;spells everything out&quot; and that he might release this at a later date.

In a deathbed statement, a landfill worker claimed to have buried Hoffa&#x27;s body in a steel drum 15 feet below the surface in a landfill beneath the Pulaski Skyway in Jersey City, New Jersey. In October 2021, the FBI obtained a warrant and completed a site survey of the landfill. In July 2022, the FBI announced that &quot;nothing of evidentiary value was discovered&quot; from the survey.

==Legacy==

Hoffa&#x27;s legacy remains controversial. Arthur Sloane wrote, &quot;To many, Hoffa was a kind of latter-day Al Capone... others, he was... hugely successful in improving working conditions for [his truck-driver constituents].&quot;

In 2023, a historical marker was erected in his home state of Indiana by the Indiana Historical Bureau, Clay County Historical Society, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

In the film &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; (1978), Sylvester Stallone plays Johnny Kovak, a character based on Hoffa.

In the Sergio Leone film &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), syndicalist James Conway O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s character, played by Treat Williams, is inspired by Hoffa.

Author James Ellroy features a fictional historical version of Hoffa in the &quot;Underworld USA Trilogy&quot; novels as an important secondary character, most prominently in the novels &quot;American Tabloid&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot; (2001).

In the comedy film &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; (2003), the titular character uses powers endowed by God to manifest Hoffa&#x27;s body in order to procure a story interesting enough to reclaim his career in the news industry.

<text>René McLean (born December 16, 1946) is a hard bop saxophonist and flutist from New York City. He started playing guitar before receiving an alto saxophone and instruction from his father, alto saxophonist Jackie McLean.

==Biography==
McLean played in the mid-1970s in a quintet with Woody Shaw and Louis Hayes and toured with Hugh Masekela in 1978.

He later studied music at New York College of Music and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. McLean received the Creative Artist Fellowship by the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts in 1986 to reside in Japan to research traditional Japanese music, arts and culture, and to perform and teach. He has recorded extensively and also has thorough experience as a music educator in the United States and South Africa.

Born in New York City, René McLean, multi-reed instrumentalist (alto, tenor, soprano saxophones, flutes, ney, shakuhachi), composer, band leader, educator, and producer, began his musical training at the age of nine under the tutelage and guidance of his father, alto saxophonist and educator Jackie McLean. René made his debut with Jackie McLean&#x27;s band in the mid-1960s and led his own bands. René McLean&#x27;s debut as a band leader and producer began at the age of 16 in 1963.

René McLean continued his studies with his stepfather as well as with the Jazz Arts Society, HARYOU ACT Cultural Program under Julian Yule, Rheet Taylor, Jackie McLean and Kenny Dorham; the Clark Terry Youth Band, Jazz Mobile and later at the New York College of Music (New York University) and the University of Massachusetts. In addition he studied privately with instructors including Sonny Rollins, Frank Foster, George Coleman, Kenny Dorham, Jackie Byard, Barry Harris and Hubert Laws.

René has performed and recorded as a leader and featured sideman with musicians of the Black Musical tradition, including Jackie McLean, the Dizzy Gillespie Big Band, Lionel Hampton All Stars, Tito Puente Orchestra, Horace Silver, Woody Shaw, Dr. Bill Taylor, Baba Olatunji, Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba, Abbey Lincoln, Dexter Gordon, James Moody, Yusef Lateef, Jaco Pastorius, Jerry Gonzales&#x27; Forte Apache Band, Hamza El Din, and in collaboration with premier poet-activist Amiri Baraka (Leroi Jones).

McLean has performed, conducted workshops and lectured at numerous universities and cultural programs in the U.S. and Caribbean (including Cuba), as well as in South America, Europe, Lebanon, Japan, Indonesia, South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Namibia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Mauritius.

From 1970 to 1973, he was bandmaster for the N.Y. State N.A.C.C. Melrose Community Center in the South Bronx. From 1984-85 René was Artist-in-Residence at the University of Hartford&#x27;s the Hartt School, Department of African American Music. Since 1985 McLean has been living in South Africa, where he has been performing, teaching and researching musical traditions. As consultant to the Mmabana Cultural Center he developed the foundation for the Center&#x27;s music program and curriculum, subsequently heading the music program from 1987 to 1990. From 1991 to 1992 he was a visiting member of the New School Jazz program. From 1994 to 1998 McLean was a Lecturer in Jazz Studies at the University of Cape Town.

McLean is Professor of African-American music on the faculty of the Jackie McLean Institute at the Hartt School, University of Hartford. He is also the Master Artist-in-Residence of Music at the Artists Collective in Hartford, Conn.

He has been the recipient of several National Endowment for the Arts grants and fellowship awards, including the prestigious Creative Artist Fellowship by the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts to reside in Japan to research traditional Japanese music culture, and to perform and teach. He has also spent time researching musical traditions and performing in Bali, Indonesia.

René McLean draws inspiration and insight from the rich diversity of the African-American tradition and various world music genres, with particular emphasis on Eastern and African traditions. He defines his music as &quot;transcending socio-political and cultural boundaries - it&#x27;s a universal language.&quot;

<text>Egon Rudi Ernst Krenz (; born 19 March 1937) is a German former politician who was the last Communist leader of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) during the Revolutions of 1989. He succeeded Erich Honecker as the General Secretary of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) but was forced to resign only weeks later when the Berlin Wall fell.

Throughout his career, Krenz held a number of prominent positions in the SED. He was Honecker&#x27;s deputy from 1984 until he succeeded him in 1989 amid protests against the regime. Krenz was unsuccessful in his attempt to retain the Communist regime&#x27;s grip on power. The SED gave up its monopoly of power some weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Krenz was forced to resign shortly afterward. He was expelled from the SED&#x27;s successor party on 21 January 1990. In 2000, he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for manslaughter for his role in the Communist regime. After his release from prison in 2003, he retired to the small town of Dierhagen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He remained on parole until the end of his sentence in 2006. Together with Karel Urbánek from Czechoslovakia, Krenz is the last former General Secretary from the Eastern Bloc still alive.

==Early years==
Krenz was born to German parents in Kolberg, then part of Nazi Germany in what is now part of Poland. His family resettled in Damgarten in 1945 during the mass repatriations and expulsions of Germans from Poland at the end of World War II.

==Political career in East Germany==

Trained as a teacher and working as a journalist early in his career, Krenz joined the Free German Youth (FDJ) in 1953, as a teenager and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1955. After serving in the Volksarmee from 1959 to 1961, he rejoined the FDJ. He studied at a prestigious Communist Party staff school in Moscow for three years, became a nomenklatura member and obtained a social science degree by 1967. Throughout his career, Krenz held a number of posts in the SED and the communist government. He was leader of the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation from 1971 to 1974, and became a member of the central committee of the party in 1973. He was also a member of the Volkskammer (East Germany&#x27;s legislature) from 1971 to 1990, and a member of its presidium from 1971 to 1981. Between 1974 and 1983, he was leader of the communist youth movement, the Free German Youth. From 1981 to 1984 he was a member of the Council of State.

In 1983, he joined the Politburo and became the Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport in the Central Committee; the same position Honecker had held before becoming General Secretary. He rose to supreme prominence when he became Honecker&#x27;s deputy on the Council of State in 1984. Around the same time, he replaced Paul Verner as the unofficial number-two man in the SED leadership, thus making him the second-most powerful man in the country. Although he was the youngest member of the Politburo (and indeed, one of only two people elevated to full membership in that body from 1976 to 1984), speculation abounded that Honecker had tapped him as his heir apparent.

==Leader of the German Democratic Republic==
Following popular protests against East Germany&#x27;s communist government, the SED Politburo voted to remove Honecker on 18 October 1989, and Krenz was elected as the new General Secretary of the SED Central Committee. Krenz had been approached several months earlier about ousting Honecker, but was reluctant to move against a man he called &quot;my foster father and political teacher&quot;. He was initially willing to wait until the seriously ill Honecker died, but by October was convinced that the situation was too grave to wait for what he had called &quot;a biological solution&quot;.

Despite many protests, the Volkskammer elected Krenz to both of Honecker&#x27;s major state posts—Chairman of the Council of State and Chairman of the National Defence Council. The former post was equivalent to that of president, while the latter post made Krenz commander-in-chief of the National People&#x27;s Army. For only the second time in the Volkskammer&#x27;s forty-year history, the vote was not unanimous (the first was on the law on abortion); 26 deputies voted against and 26 abstained.
In his first address as leader, Krenz promised to blunt some of the harsher edges of Honecker&#x27;s regime and promised democratic reforms. The speech was identical to the one he had given to a closed group of the SED Central Committee; he even addressed the national audience as &quot;Genossen&quot; (comrades)–a term reserved for members of the SED. The speech sounded formulaic, and few East Germans believed him. For instance, they still remembered that after the Tiananmen Square protest just months earlier, he had gone to China to thank Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the regime. In Honecker&#x27;s resignation speech, he named Krenz as his successor, further conveying an impression of undemocratic intransigence. For this and other reasons, Krenz was almost as detested as Honecker had been; one popular joke suggested that the only difference between them was that Krenz still had a gallbladder. Indeed, almost as soon as he took power, thousands of East Germans took to the streets to demand his resignation.

Also on the same day he took office, Krenz received a top secret report from planning chief Gerhard Schürer that showed the depths of East Germany&#x27;s economic crisis. It showed that East Germany did not have enough money to make payments on the massive foreign loans that propped up the economy, and it was now DM123 billion in debt. Although Krenz had been the number-two man in the administration, Honecker had kept the true state of the economy a secret from him. Krenz was forced to send Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski to beg West Germany for a short-term loan to make interest payments. However, West Germany was unwilling to even consider negotiations until the SED abandoned power and allowed free elections—something that Krenz was unwilling to concede.

This was not the only evidence that Krenz did not intend to truly open up the regime. While publicly discussing such reforms as loosening travel restrictions, he also personally ordered the rejection of the dissident group New Forum&#x27;s application to become an approved organisation. Ahead of the large Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November, he ordered the Stasi to prevent any unauthorised attempt to cross the border by &quot;bodily violence&quot;.

On 7 November, Krenz approved the resignation of Prime Minister Willi Stoph and his entire cabinet along with two-thirds of the Politburo. However, the Central Committee unanimously re-elected Krenz to the position of General Secretary. In a speech, Krenz attempted a reckoning with history, which also criticised his political mentor Honecker. Yet, by this stage, events were rapidly spiralling out of his control.

Despite promises of reform, public opposition to the regime continued to grow. In an attempt to stem the tide, Krenz authorised the reopening of the border with Czechoslovakia, which had been sealed to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. The newly formed Politburo agreed to adopt new regulations for trips to the West by way of a Council of Ministers resolution.

==Opening of the Berlin Wall==
On 6 November, the Interior Ministry published a draft of new travel regulations. While branded as a major change, in truth the draft made only cosmetic changes to Honecker-era rules. While state offices were supposed to approve applications &quot;quickly&quot;, it actually took up to 30 days to process applications for ordinary travel abroad and up to six months for emigration. Not only could applications be denied for the usual reasons (national security, public order, public health, public morals, etc.) but it made no guarantee that people travelling abroad would get access to foreign currency. The draft enraged ordinary citizens, and was denounced as &quot;complete trash&quot; by West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper.

In a case of particularly bad timing, the draft was published just days after the government allowed travel to Czechoslovakia to resume. This resulted in a flood of refugees crowding onto the steps of the West German embassy in Prague. The enraged Czechoslovaks gave their East German counterparts an ultimatum: unless the matter was dealt with at once, Prague would have to seriously consider sealing off the East German-Czechoslovak border. At a Politburo meeting on 7 November, it was decided to enact the section of the draft travel regulations addressing permanent emigration immediately. Initially, the Politburo planned to create a special border crossing near Schirnding specifically for this emigration. The Interior and Stasi bureaucrats charged with crafting the new text, however, concluded this was not feasible, and crafted a new text relating to both emigration and temporary travel. It stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips, and also allowed for permanent emigration between all border crossings—including those between East and West Berlin. 
The new text was completed on 9 November. However, no one briefed the Politburo&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; spokesman, East Berlin party boss Günter Schabowski, that the regulations were going to come into effect the following afternoon. Thus, at the daily press conference, when a reporter asked when the regulations would come into force, Schabowski assumed they were already in effect and replied, &quot;As far as I know—immediately, without delay.&quot; Excerpts from the press conference aired on West German television, which was viewable in most of East Germany. This prompted a mass exodus to the Berlin Wall by thousands of East Berliners, believing the statement to be a decision to open the border crossings at the Wall. Krenz and the rest of the leadership were unwilling to order the use of deadly force. Finally, the unprepared and outnumbered border guards, on their own authority, let the crowds pass into West Berlin.

The fall of the Berlin Wall destroyed Krenz and the SED politically. On 18 November, Krenz swore in a new coalition government. Instead of an oath, it consisted of a simple handshake. However, it was obvious that the SED was living on borrowed time. The CDU and the LDPD, long subservient to the SED, threw out their pro-Communist leaderships and announced that they were leaving the National Front. The new CDU Presidium, under the leadership of Lothar de Maizière, also demanded the resignation of Krenz as chairman of the Council of State and Chairman of the National Defense Council.

On 1 December, the Volkskammer significantly amended the East German constitution to purge it of its Communist character. Most notably, Article One, which declared East Germany to be a socialist state under the leadership of the SED, was deleted. Two days later, the entire Politburo and Central Committee—including Krenz—resigned and a working committee took over direction of the party. On 6 December 1989, Krenz resigned from his remaining leadership posts. He was succeeded as head of state by LDPD leader Manfred Gerlach. In a bid to rehabilitate itself ahead of East Germany&#x27;s first free election, the successor organisation to the SED, the Party of Democratic Socialism, expelled Krenz and several other former leaders of the Communist regime in 1990.

==Trial and imprisonment==
In 1997, Krenz was sentenced to six-and-a-half years&#x27; imprisonment for Cold War crimes, specifically manslaughter of four Germans attempting to escape East Germany over the Berlin Wall. He was also charged with electoral fraud, along with other criminal offences. 

He appealed, arguing that the legal framework of the newly reunited German state did not apply to events that had taken place in the former East Germany. Krenz also argued that the prosecution of former East German officials was a breach of a personal agreement given by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev during their talks, which led to German reunification. However, the verdict was upheld in 1999. Krenz reportedly described his conviction as &quot;victor&#x27;s justice&quot; and &quot;cold war in court&quot;, saying, &quot;The victorious power is avenging itself on the representatives of the defeated power&quot; (&quot;Die siegreiche Macht rächt sich an den Vertretern der besiegten Macht&quot;).

Krenz began serving his sentence in Hakenfelde Prison shortly thereafter, working in the prison laundry. He was later transferred to Plötzensee Prison, a prison with stricter rules, where he worked in the prison laundry and as an inmate orderly. Krenz&#x27;s application to the European Court of Human Rights on alleged misuse of East German criminal laws reached the Grand Chamber, but was rejected in 2001.

He was released from prison in December 2003 after serving nearly four years of his sentence, and quietly retired with his wife Erika (1939–2017) to Dierhagen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He remained on parole until the end of his sentence in 2006.

==Later life==
Krenz currently lives in Dierhagen, a town on the Baltic Sea coast in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Unlike other high-ranking former members of the SED, such as Günter Schabowski and Günther Kleiber, Krenz still defends the former East Germany and maintains he has not changed his political views.

Krenz is fluent in Russian and has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin, saying &quot;After weak presidents like Gorbachev and Yeltsin, it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin&quot;, while believing that the Cold War never ended. He is a Russophile and has implied that he is a popular emblem of Ostalgie. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he has expressed his support for peace negotiations and his opposition to Germany and other Western countries sending weapons to Ukraine. Furthermore, he has called for an end to all sanctions against Russia. He has also praised China, saying &quot;absolute poverty has been eliminated&quot; there.

<text>The United States Chess Federation (also known as US Chess or USCF) is the governing body for chess competition in the United States and represents the U.S. in The World Chess Federation (FIDE). USCF administers the official national rating system, awards national titles, sanctions over twenty national championships annually, and publishes two magazines: &quot;Chess Life&quot; and &quot;Chess Life Kids&quot;. The USCF was founded and incorporated in Illinois in 1939, from the merger of two older chess organizations. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Its membership as COVID hit was 97,000; as of 2024 the membership was 112,000.

==History==
In 1939, the United States of America Chess Federation was created in Illinois through the merger of the American Chess Federation and National Chess Federation. The American Chess Federation, formerly the Western Chess Association, had held an annual open championship since 1900; that tournament, after the merger, became the U.S. Open. The National Chess Federation, founded in 1927 to organize U.S. participation in the Olympiads, had held the prestigious invitational U.S. Championship since 1936.
The combined membership at the time was around 1,000. Membership experienced consistent, modest growth until 1958, when Bobby Fischer won the U.S. Championship at the age of 14. This began the &quot;Fischer era&quot;, during which USCF membership grew thirty-fold, to approximately 60,000 in 1974, after Fischer had won the World Chess Championship.

The Fischer era did not last long, but the USCF has grown substantially since then, largely because of the explosive growth of scholastic chess. Annual national championship tournaments are now held at different grade and age levels; none of these tournaments, which now attract thousands of players, even existed prior to 1969.

At its founding, the USCF had no employees and no headquarters, but in 1952, it hired a Business Manager (the position eventually became Executive Director), headquartered in New York. In 1967, headquarters moved to Newburgh, New York; in 1976, New Windsor, New York; in 2006, Crossville, Tennessee; and in 2022, St. Louis, Missouri.

==Governance==
The U.S. Chess Federation has, in effect, two governing bodies. The Board of Delegates, composed of 140 persons designated by the state affiliates, as well as some other categories, meets annually at the U.S. Open. The Executive Board, composed of eight persons elected by the membership to staggered four-year terms, meets monthly.

==Ratings==

US Chess implements rating systems for chess players. In each system, a rating is a calculated numerical estimate of a player&#x27;s strength, based on results in tournament play against other rated players. Tournament organizers submit results to US Chess, which carries out the calculations and publishes the results.

A player can have up to seven ratings: for correspondence games, for over-the-board games at regular (slow), quick, or blitz time controls, and for online games regular, quick, or blitz time controls. Ratings are posted online on the US Chess Player Search web page. Ratings for over-the-board play range from 100 to nearly 3000, with a higher rating indicating a stronger player. Ratings are often used by tournament organizers to determine eligibility for &quot;class&quot; prizes, and eligibility to enter &quot;class&quot; sections, in tournaments.

USCF first instituted a rating system for over-the-board play in 1950, using a calculation formula devised by Kenneth Harkness. In 1960, the USCF adopted a more reliable rating system invented by Arpad Elo, a college professor of physics who was a chess master. Elo worked with USCF for many years. The system he invented, or a variant of it, was later adopted by FIDE, and is utilized in other games and sports, including USA Today&#x27;s college football and basketball rankings. USCF has made further adjustments to the rating calculation over the years; the present calculation was influenced by the &quot;Glicko rating system&quot; developed by Prof. Mark Glickman, a significant refinement of Elo&#x27;s system.

==Titles==

US Chess awards titles for lifetime achievement. These should not be confused with the titles awarded by FIDE, such as Grandmaster and International Master.

US Chess awards a player who achieves a rating of 2200 or above the title of National Master and sends the player a certificate. Likewise, a Senior Master certificate is awarded for a rating of 2400 or higher. Until 2008, the only other title awarded was that of Life Master, awarded to players who played 300 or more rated games while maintaining a rating above 2200.

In 2008, the USCF implemented a system of &quot;norms-based titles&quot;, patterned after the titles awarded by FIDE: if a person has (for example) five tournaments in which they demonstrate strength above 2400, and if in addition their rating at some time eventually reaches 2400, then they earn the Life Senior Master title. The system is somewhat more complicated than this simple example suggests. The old Life Master title was renamed Original Life Master to avoid confusion with the new Life Master title; both are recognized and tracked by US Chess. Titles are posted on the same Player Search web page as ratings.
==National championships==
US Chess organizes or sanctions various national championships. Most of these are held annually.

The oldest is the U.S. Open. It began as the Western Open in 1900, held in Minnesota. It is the &quot;congress&quot; of US Chess – the annual meeting of the Delegates is held concurrently, as well as many smaller gatherings and events. Several hundred players participate (the highest number, 836, was at the 1983 event in Pasadena). Five invitational events are held concurrently. Each US Chess state affiliate nominates a representative to each of the five invitationals. The five invitationals are: The National Tournament of Senior State Champions (50+), The GM Arnold Denker National Tournament of High School State Champions (9-12), The Dewain Barber National Tournament of Middle School State Champions (6-8), The John D. Rockefeller National Tournament of Elementary School State Champions (K-5), and The Ruth Haring National Tournament of Girls State Champions (K-12). Players generally qualify for these events by winning a state championship tournament, although each state affiliate is allowed to use any criteria for selecting its representatives. 

The U.S. Championship, an invitational event, has been held since 1936. (For many years before that, the national championship had been decided by head-to-head match play.) Noteworthy past winners include Samuel Reshevsky and Bobby Fischer, eight times each; Walter Browne, six times; and Larry Evans, Gata Kamsky, and Hikaru Nakamura with five times each. The 2023 tournament was won by Fabiano Caruana.

The U.S. Women&#x27;s Championship, also invitational, has been held since 1937. In recent years it has been held concurrently with the U.S. Championship. The 2023 tournament was won by Carissa Yip.

The largest national championships are the Elementary (K-6), Junior High (K-9), and High School (K-12) Championships which are held annually in the spring. Every four years the &quot;Supernationals,&quot; an event combining all three in one tournament, is held. The last Supernationals in 2017 drew over 5,500 players to Nashville, Tennessee and was claimed to be the largest rated chess tournament ever. The oldest of the three, the National High School, was first held in 1969 by the Continental Chess Association.

The Elementary, Junior High, and High School championships should not be confused with the National Grade Level Championships, held in December, in which each grade level from K to 12 has its own championship.

Except for the U.S. Championship, the tournaments listed above are organized by US Chess itself. But the US Chess calendar of national events also includes quite a few events that are bid out to interested affiliates. Here is a partial list:

US Chess also organizes national championships of correspondence chess:
==Publications==
US Chess publishes two magazines, the monthly &quot;Chess Life&quot;, and bi-monthly &quot;Chess Life for Kids&quot;, which is geared towards those under 14. &quot;Chess Life&quot;, which began in 1946 as a bi-weekly newspaper, is now a glossy full-color magazine of 72 pages per issue.

US Chess also publishes a rulebook. The current 7th edition is self-published by US Chess and produced in paperback and kindle forms. The most relevant chapters for over-the-board play are also available to download for free online from the US Chess website.

<doc id="255742" wikidata="Q342537" url="?curid=255742" title="George Reeves">
<text>George Reeves (born George Keefer Brewer; January 5, 1914 – June 16, 1959) was an American actor. He was best known for portraying Clark Kent/Superman in the television series &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; (1952–1958).

His death by gunshot at age 45 remains controversial. The official finding was suicide, but some believe that he was murdered or the victim of an accidental shooting.

==Early life==
Reeves was born January 5, 1914, as George Keefer Brewer in Woolstock, Iowa, the son of Donald Carl Brewer and Helen Lescher. Reeves was born five months into their marriage. When the couple separated, soon after Reeves&#x27;s birth, Reeves and his mother moved from Iowa to Ashland, Kentucky, to stay with relatives for a time and then to her home in Galesburg, Illinois.

Later, Reeves&#x27;s mother, who was of German descent, moved to California to stay with her sister. There, by 1920, she had met and married Frank Joseph Bessolo (according to that year&#x27;s federal census). Reeves&#x27;s father married Helen Schultz in 1925. Reeves reportedly never saw his father again. In 1927, when Reeves was 13, Frank Bessolo adopted him, and the boy took his stepfather&#x27;s last name, becoming George Bessolo. The Bessolos’ marriage lasted 15 years, ending in divorce, with the couple separating while Reeves was away visiting relatives. When he returned, his mother told him his stepfather had died by suicide. According to biographer Jim Beaver, Reeves did not know for several years that Bessolo was still alive. Bessolo actually died March 4, 1944, at age 51, when his adopted son was well into his movie career.

Reeves began acting and singing in high school and continued performing on stage as a student at Pasadena Junior College.

==Acting career==
While studying acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, Reeves met his future wife, Ellanora Needles, great-great-granddaughter of John Robinson, who had been a circus magnate and founder of the John Robinson Circus. They married on September 22, 1940, in San Gabriel, California, at the Church of Our Savior. They had no children and divorced 10 years later.

Reeves&#x27;s film career began in 1939 when he was cast as Stuart Tarleton (incorrectly listed in the film&#x27;s credits as Brent Tarleton), one of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s suitors in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. It was a minor role, but he and Fred Crane were in the film&#x27;s opening scene. (Reeves and Crane both dyed their hair red to portray the Tarleton twins.) After &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was filmed, Reeves returned to the Pasadena Playhouse and was given the lead role in the play &quot;Pancho.&quot; This part directly led to his being contracted to Warner Brothers. Warner had him change his professional name to George Reeves. His &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; screen credit reflects the change. Between the start of production on &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and its release 12 months later, several films on his Warner contract were made and released, making &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; his first film role, but his fifth film release.

He starred in a number of two-reel short subjects and appeared in several B-pictures, including two with future President of the United States Ronald Reagan and three with James Cagney (&quot;Torrid Zone&quot;, &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot;, and &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot;). These roles did little to advance Reeves&#x27;s career, and his contract with Warners was dissolved by mutual consent.

Released from his Warner contract, he signed a contract with Twentieth Century-Fox but was released after only a handful of films, one of which was the Charlie Chan movie &quot;Dead Men Tell&quot;. Twentieth Century-Fox loaned him to producer Alexander Korda to co-star with Merle Oberon in &quot;Lydia&quot;, a box-office failure, after which he freelanced, looking to find work in westerns. His friend Teddi Sherman introduced him to her father, producer Harry Sherman, who asked Reeves to do a screen test with Teddi for the Hopalong Cassidy films. Reeves and Sherman impressed the casting director by performing seven pages of script in a single take without pause. Reeves appeared in five Hopalong Cassidy westerns before being cast as Lieutenant John Summers opposite Claudette Colbert in &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; (1942), a war drama for Paramount Pictures, which signed Reeves up for two films a year.

However, Reeves was inspired by &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; to put his budding acting career on hold and enlist in the U.S. Army. He was drafted in early 1943. He was assigned to the U.S. Army Air Forces and performed in the USAAF&#x27;s Broadway show &quot;Winged Victory&quot;. The long Broadway run was followed by a national tour and a movie version. Reeves was then transferred to the Army Air Force’s First Motion Picture Unit, where he made training films.

Discharged at the war&#x27;s end, Reeves returned to Hollywood. Many studios were slowing down their production schedules, however, and some production units had shut down completely. He appeared in a pair of outdoor thrillers with Ralph Byrd. As more and more time passed between acting jobs that paid less and less, Reeves was reduced to appearing in a low-budget serial produced by Sam Katzman, &quot;The Adventures of Sir Galahad&quot;, and taking a second job digging cesspools. Reeves fit the rugged requirements of the roles, and, with his excellent memory for dialogue, he did well under rushed production conditions. He was able to play against type, starring as a villainous gold hunter in a Johnny Weissmuller Jungle Jim film. After separating from his wife, Reeves moved to New York City in 1949 (their divorce became final in 1950). He performed on live television anthology programs, as well as on radio, and then returned to Hollywood in 1951 for a role in a Fritz Lang film, &quot;Rancho Notorious&quot;.

In 1953, Reeves played a minor character, Sergeant Maylon Stark, in &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and gave Reeves the distinction of having appeared in two &quot;Best Picture&quot; films.

===Superman===

In June 1951, Reeves was offered the role of Superman in a new television series titled &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;. He was initially reluctant to take the role because, like many actors of his time, he considered television unimportant and believed few would see his work. The half-hour films were shot on tight schedules; at least two shows were made every six days. According to commentaries on the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; DVD sets, multiple scripts were filmed simultaneously to take advantage of the standing sets; for example, all the &quot;Perry White&#x27;s office&quot; scenes for three or four episodes would be shot the same day, and the various &quot;apartment&quot; scenes would also be done consecutively.

Reeves&#x27;s career as Superman had begun with &quot;Superman and the Mole Men&quot;, a film intended both as a B-picture and as the pilot for the TV series. Immediately after completing it, Reeves and the crew began production of the first season&#x27;s episodes, all shot over 13 weeks in the summer of 1951. The series went on the air the following year, and Reeves was amazed at becoming a national celebrity. In 1952, the struggling ABC Network purchased the show for national broadcast, which gave him greater visibility.

The Superman cast members had restrictive contracts preventing them from taking other work that might interfere with the series. Except for the second season, the Superman schedule was brief (13 shows shot two per week, a total of seven weeks out of a year), but all had a &quot;30-day clause&quot;, which meant that the producers could demand their exclusive services for a new season on four weeks&#x27; notice. This prevented long-term work on major films with long schedules, stage plays that might lead to a lengthy run, or any other series work.

Reeves, however, was able to leverage his new role and earn additional income by making numerous personal appearances. He had affection for his young fans and took his role-model status seriously. He avoided smoking cigarettes where children could see him and eventually quit smoking. He kept his private life discreet, including a romantic relationship with Toni Mannix, wife of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer general manager Eddie Mannix.

In the documentary &quot;Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman&quot;, Jack Larson said that, when he first met Reeves, he told him that he enjoyed his performance in &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; According to Larson, Reeves said that if Mark Sandrich had not died, he would not be there in &quot;this monkey suit&quot;. According to Larson, Reeves also said he would feel better about the role if he knew he had any adult fans; he never learned that &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; had adult fans even during its original broadcast run.

Between the first and second seasons of &quot;Superman&quot;, Reeves got sporadic acting assignments in one-shot TV anthology programs and in two feature films, &quot;Forever Female&quot; (1953) and Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot; (1953), but by the time the series was airing nationwide, Reeves found himself so closely associated with the characters of Superman and Clark Kent that it was difficult for him to book other roles.

During the show&#x27;s run, Reeves worked tirelessly with Toni Mannix to raise money for fighting myasthenia gravis; his efforts resulted in his being appointed as national chairman for the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation in 1955. During the second season, Reeves returned to working with the government when he appeared in a short film for the Treasury Department entitled &quot;Stamp Day for Superman&quot;, in which he caught the villains and told children why they should invest in government savings stamps.
After two seasons, Reeves decided not to renew his contract and left the show. He was frustrated with his low salary, the one-dimensional nature of his character, and how associating himself with Superman had ruined his credibility as a dramatic actor. At 40 years old, he also felt uncomfortable playing such an intensely physical role.

Eager to jump-start his failing career, Reeves established his own production company and conceived a TV adventure series called &quot;Port of Entry&quot;, which was to be shot on location in Hawaii and Mexico. Reeves wrote the pilot script himself. However, the producers of &quot;Superman&quot;, unable to find a suitable replacement, lured him back to the show with a major salary increase. He was reportedly making $5,000 (about $ in today&#x27;s dollars) per week, but only while the show was in production (about eight weeks each year). Reeves was never able to gain financing for his &quot;Port of Entry&quot; project, and the show was never made.

In 1957, the producers considered making a theatrical film: &quot;Superman and the Secret Planet&quot;. A script was commissioned from David Chantler, who had written many of the TV scripts. In 1959, however, negotiations began for a renewal of the series, with 26 episodes scheduled to go into production. By mid-1959, contracts were signed, costumes refitted, and new teleplay writers assigned. Noel Neill was quoted as saying that the cast of &quot;Superman&quot; was ready to do a new series of the still-popular show.

His good friend Bill Walsh, a producer at Disney Studios, gave Reeves a prominent role in &quot;Westward Ho the Wagons!&quot; (1956), in which Reeves wore a beard and mustache; it would be his final film appearance. Attempting to showcase his versatility, Reeves performed a song on the Tony Bennett show in August 1956. He appeared as Superman on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (Episode #166, &quot;Lucy and Superman&quot;) in 1957. Character actor Ben Welden had acted with Reeves in the Warner Bros. days and frequently guest-starred on &quot;Superman&quot;. He said, &quot;After the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; show, Superman was no longer a challenge to him... I know he enjoyed the role, but he used to say, &#x27;Here I am, wasting my life.&#x27;&quot;

Reeves, Noel Neill, Natividad Vacío, Gene LeBell, and a trio of musicians toured with a public-appearance show from 1957 onward. The first half of the show was a &quot;Superman&quot; sketch in which Reeves and Neill performed with LeBell as a villain called &quot;Mr. Kryptonite&quot; who captured Lois Lane. Kent then rushed offstage to return as Superman, who came to the rescue and fought with the bad guy. The second half of the show was Reeves out of costume as himself, singing and accompanying himself on the guitar. Vacio and Neill accompanied him in duets.

Reeves and Toni Mannix split in 1958 and Reeves announced his engagement to society playgirl Leonore Lemmon. Reeves was apparently scheduled to marry Lemmon on June 19 and then spend their honeymoon in Tijuana. He complained to friends, columnists, and his mother about his financial problems. The planned revival of &quot;Superman&quot; was apparently a small lifeline. Reeves had also hoped to direct a low-budget science-fiction film written by a friend from his Pasadena Playhouse days, and he had discussed the project with his first Lois Lane, Phyllis Coates, the previous year. However, Reeves and his partner failed to find financing, and the film was never made. Another Superman stage show was scheduled for July with a planned stage tour of Australia. Reeves had options for making a living, but those options apparently all involved playing Superman again—a role that he was not eager to reprise at age 45.

Jack Larson and Noel Neill both remembered Reeves as a noble Southern gentleman (even though he was from Iowa) with a sign on his dressing room door that said &quot;Honest George, the people&#x27;s friend&quot;. Reeves had been made a &quot;Kentucky Colonel&quot; during a publicity trip in the South, and the sign on his dressing room door was replaced with a new one that read &quot;Honest George, also known as Col. Reeves&quot;, created by the show&#x27;s prop department. A photo of a smiling Reeves and the sign appears in Gary Grossman&#x27;s book about the show.

==Death==
Reeves died of a gunshot wound to the head, in the upstairs bedroom of his home at 1579 Benedict Canyon Drive in Benedict Canyon between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. on June 16, 1959, according to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) report.

Leonore Lemmon and other party guests were in the home at the time. Lemmon told the police that she was in the living room with the guests at the time of the shooting, but hearsay statements from Fred Crane, Reeves&#x27;s friend and colleague from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, put Lemmon either inside or in direct proximity to Reeves&#x27;s bedroom. According to Crane (who was not present), Bill Bliss had told Millicent Trent after the shot rang out, while Bliss was having a drink, that Leonore Lemmon came downstairs and said, &quot;Tell them I was down here, tell them I was down here!&quot;

A number of questionable physical findings were reported by investigators and others. No fingerprints were recovered from the gun. No gunpowder residue was found on Reeves&#x27;s hands. (Some sources contend that it may not have been looked for, as gunshot residue testing was not routinely performed in 1959.) The bullet that killed Reeves was recovered from the bedroom ceiling, and the spent shell casing was found under his body. Two additional bullets were discovered embedded in the bedroom floor. All three bullets had been fired from the weapon found at Reeves&#x27;s feet, though all witnesses agreed they heard only one gunshot, and there was no sign of forced entry or other physical evidence that a second person was in the room. Despite the unanswered questions, Reeves&#x27;s death was officially ruled a suicide, based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and the autopsy report.

In contemporaneous news articles, Lemmon attributed Reeves&#x27;s alleged suicide to depression caused by his &quot;failed career&quot; and inability to find more work. The report made by the LAPD states, &quot;[Reeves was]... depressed because he couldn&#x27;t get the sort of parts he wanted.&quot; Newspapers and wire-service reports quoted LAPD Sergeant V.A. Peterson as saying: &quot;Miss Lemmon blurted, &#x27;He&#x27;s probably going to go shoot himself.&#x27; A noise was heard upstairs. She continued, &#x27;He&#x27;s opening a drawer to get the gun.&#x27; A shot was heard. &#x27;See there—I told you so!&#x27;&quot;

Reeves is interred at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in Altadena, California. In 1960, Reeves was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard for his contributions to the TV industry. In 1985, he was posthumously named one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

===Controversy===
Reeves&#x27;s mother thought it was premature and peremptory to rule the death a suicide, and retained attorney Jerry Giesler to petition for a reinvestigation of the case as a possible homicide. The findings of a second autopsy, conducted at Giesler&#x27;s request, were the same as the first, except for a series of bruises of unknown origin about the head and body. A month later, having uncovered no evidence contradicting the official finding, Giesler announced that he was satisfied that the gunshot wound had been self-inflicted and withdrew.

Actors Alan Ladd and Gig Young were reportedly skeptical of the official determination. Reeves&#x27;s friend Rory Calhoun told a reporter &quot;No one in Hollywood believed the suicide story.&quot; In their book &quot;Hollywood Kryptonite&quot;, Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger make a case for the involvement of MGM vice president and fixer Eddie Mannix. Reeves had been having an affair with his wife Toni Mannix. Others suggested that Eddie Mannix, rumored to have Mafia ties, ordered Reeves killed.

=== In popular culture ===
The 2006 film &quot;Hollywoodland&quot;, starring Ben Affleck as Reeves and Diane Lane as Toni Mannix. Adrien Brody plays Louis Simo, a fictional private investigator with a working class Italian American background and an obsession with chasing fame and fortune. Simo is partially inspired by actual private detective Milo Speriglio, who was hired by Reeves&#x27; mother to investigate her son&#x27;s death. The film&#x27;s fictionalized investigation suggests four possible explanations: 

:1. An accidental shooting by an angry and intoxicated Lenore Lemmon during a heated argument.
:2. A contract killing arranged by Eddie Mannix, who is also subtly hinted to have quietly sabotaged Reeves&#x27; efforts to found his own production company, in retaliation for breaking Toni&#x27;s heart.
:3. A revenge killing by a jealous and heartbroken Toni Mannix, who allegedly still had the house keys and knew about a separate way in and out of the upstairs room, and covered up afterwards by Eddie Mannix out of loyalty and genuine love for his wife.
:4. A simple act of suicide rooted in George Reeves&#x27; despondent belief that he was a complete failure in both his acting career and personal life. 

While seeking to remain open-ended, the film implies that suicide is the most likely explanation for Reeves&#x27; death. This climactic realization devastates Brody&#x27;s character, but also causes him to reevaluate his own priorities in life, which ultimately causes him to cease chasing celebrity status and focus instead upon his neglected role as a family man. 

A computer graphics version of Reeves as Superman appears in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023). The use of the computer graphics render led to a backlash from fans.

<doc id="255748" wikidata="Q369557" url="?curid=255748" title="Methodist Episcopal Church">
<text>The Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) was the oldest and largest Methodist denomination in the United States from its founding in 1784 until 1939. It was also the first religious denomination in the US to organize itself nationally. In 1939, the MEC reunited with two breakaway Methodist denominations (the Methodist Protestant Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South) to form the Methodist Church. In 1968, the Methodist Church merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form the United Methodist Church.

The MEC&#x27;s origins lie in the First Great Awakening when Methodism emerged as an evangelical revival movement within the Church of England that stressed the necessity of being born again and the possibility of attaining Christian perfection. By the 1760s, Methodism had spread to the Thirteen Colonies, and Methodist societies were formed under the oversight of John Wesley. As in England, American Methodists remained affiliated with the Church of England, but this state of affairs became untenable after the American Revolution. In response, Wesley ordained the first Methodist elders for America in 1784. Under the leadership of its first bishops, Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury, the Methodist Episcopal Church adopted episcopal polity and an itinerant model of ministry that saw circuit riders provide for the religious needs of a widespread and mobile population.

Early Methodism was countercultural in that it was anti-elitist and anti-slavery, appealing especially to African Americans and women. While critics derided Methodists as fanatics, the Methodist Episcopal Church continued to grow, especially during the Second Great Awakening in which Methodist revivalism and camp meetings left its imprint on American culture. In the early 19th century, the MEC became the largest and most influential religious denomination in the United States. With growth came greater institutionalization and respectability, and this led some within the church to complain that Methodism was losing its vitality and commitment to Wesleyan teachings, such as the belief in Christian perfection and opposition to slavery.

As Methodism took hold in the Southern United States, church leaders became less willing to condemn the practice of slavery or to grant African American preachers and congregations the same privileges as their European American counterparts. A number of black churches were formed as African Americans withdrew from the MEC, including the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. By the 1830s, however, a renewed abolitionist movement within the MEC made keeping a neutral position on slavery impossible. Ultimately, the church divided along regional lines in 1845 when pro-slavery Methodists in the South formed their own Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Around the same time, the holiness movement took shape as a renewal movement within the MEC focused on the experience of Christian perfection, but it eventually led a number of splinter groups to break away from the church, most notably the Free Methodist Church and Wesleyan Methodist Church. Due to large-scale immigration of Catholics, the Catholic Church displaced the MEC as the largest US denomination by the end of the 19th century.

==History==
===Background (1766–1783)===
The Methodist Episcopal Church originated from the spread of Methodism outside of England to the Thirteen Colonies in the 1760s. Earlier, Methodism had grown out of the ministry of John Wesley, a priest in the Church of England (also known as the Anglican Church) who preached an evangelical message centered on justification by faith, repentance, the possibility of having assurance of salvation, and the doctrine of Christian perfection.

Wesley was loyal to the Anglican Church, and he organized his followers into parachurch societies and classes with the goal of promoting spiritual revival within the Church of England. Members of Methodist societies were expected to attend and receive Holy Communion in their local parish church, but Wesley also recruited and supervised lay preachers for itinerant or traveling ministry.

Around fifteen or twenty societies formed a circuit. Anywhere from two to four itinerant preachers would be assigned to a circuit on a yearly basis to preach and supervise the societies within their circuit. One itinerant preacher in each circuit would be made the &quot;assistant&quot; (because he was an assistant to Wesley), and he would direct the activities of the other itinerant preachers in the circuit, who were called &quot;helpers&quot;. Wesley gave out preaching assignments at an annual conference.

In 1769, Wesley sent itinerants Robert Williams, Richard Boardman, and Joseph Pilmore to oversee Methodists in America after learning that societies had already been organized there as early as 1766 by Philip Embury, Robert Strawbridge, and Thomas Webb. In 1773, Wesley appointed Thomas Rankin general assistant, placing him in charge of all the Methodist preachers and societies in America. On July 4, 1773, Rankin presided over the first annual conference on American soil at Philadelphia. At that time there were 1,160 Methodists in America led by ten lay preachers. Itinerant Methodist preachers would become known as circuit riders.

Methodist societies in America also operated within the Church of England. There were several Anglican priests who supported the work of the Methodists, attending Methodist meetings and administering the sacraments to Methodists. These included Charles Pettigrew of North Carolina, Samuel Magaw of Dover and then Philadelphia, and Uzel Ogden of New Jersey. Anglican clergyman Devereux Jarratt (1733–1801) was a particularly active supporter, founding Methodist societies in Virginia and North Carolina.

===Establishment (1784)===

The American Revolution severed ties to England and left America&#x27;s Anglican Church in disarray. Due to the scarcity of Anglican ministers, Methodists in the United States were unable to receive the sacraments of baptism and Holy Communion. On September 1, 1784, Wesley responded to this situation by personally ordaining two Methodists as elders for America, with the right to administer the sacraments, and also ordained Thomas Coke (who was already an Anglican priest) as a superintendent with authority to ordain other Methodist clergy.

Because Wesley was not a bishop, his ordination of Coke and the others was not recognized by the Church of England, and, consequently, this marked American Methodism&#x27;s separation from the Anglican Church. Wesley&#x27;s actions were based in his belief that the order of bishop and priest were one and the same, so that both possess the power to ordain others.

The founding conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, known commonly as the Christmas Conference, was held in December 1784 at Lovely Lane Chapel in Baltimore, Maryland. At this conference, Coke ordained Francis Asbury as co-superintendent according to Wesley&#x27;s wishes. Asbury had been serving as general assistant since Rankin returned to England. The German-born Philip W. Otterbein, who later helped found the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, participated in Asbury&#x27;s ordination.

The conference adopted Articles of Religion prepared by Wesley (and adapted from the Church of England&#x27;s Thirty-nine Articles) as a doctrinal statement for the new church, and it also received an abridged version of the Church of England&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer provided by Wesley, titled &quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists; With Other Occasional Services&quot;. American Methodists, however, preferred non-liturgical worship and &quot;The Sunday Service&quot; was largely ignored.

The conference adopted an organization consisting of superintendents, elders, deacons, traveling preachers, and local preachers. Preachers were licensed to preach but were not ordained and could not administer sacraments. Traveling preachers worked full-time in itinerant ministry and were supported financially by the societies they served. Local preachers pursued secular employment but preached on Sundays in their local communities. Deacons were preachers authorized by a superintendent to officiate weddings, bury the dead, baptize, and assist the elders in administering the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Only ordained elders could administer the Lord&#x27;s Supper, and they were also placed in charge of circuits. In the year of its founding, the church claimed 14,986 members and 83 preachers.

====Early characteristics====
Early Methodists were drawn from the ranks of slaves, poor whites, and &quot;middling people&quot;—artisans, shopkeepers, petty merchants and small planters. These social classes were attracted to Methodism&#x27;s condemnation of the worldliness of the gentry. Slaves and free blacks were especially attracted to the Methodist Episcopal Church&#x27;s condemnation of slavery. Prominent Methodists such as Coke, Asbury, and Freeborn Garrettson preached an antislavery message, and the Christmas Conference mandated that all Methodist laity and preachers emancipate their slaves. While African Americans were not yet ordained and classes were segregated by race, important African American leaders did emerge, such as Harry Hosier who was an associate of Asbury and Coke.

Because of Methodism&#x27;s conscious repudiation of upper class values and lifestyles, elite women who converted took on a revolutionary character. While women were not granted formal leadership roles (though some were class leaders occasionally), they played important roles in evangelization through class relations, family networks, correspondence, and in the home. It was common for both women and slaves to publicly deliver exhortations—testimonials and personal conversion narratives distinguishable from sermons because exhorters did not &quot;take a text&quot; from the Bible.

Meetings and services were often characterized by extremely emotional and demonstrative styles of worship. As part of the conversion experience, people often trembled, groaned, screamed, or fell motionless to the ground as if dead. These bodily experiences as well as Methodist ascetic practices and claims of receiving direct communication from the Holy Spirit inspired its opponents to accuse Methodism of being a form of religious enthusiasm that caused insanity. Because of its Arminian doctrines, the evangelistic work of the Methodist Episcopal Church was often opposed by Calvinists.

===Growth, the first General Conference, and the O&#x27;Kelly Schism (1785–1792)===
Coke had returned to Britain in 1785 but arrived back in the United States in 1787 with written instructions from Wesley. Wesley ordered the holding of a conference and that Richard Whatcoat be appointed a superintendent. At the conference, James O&#x27;Kelly and Jesse Lee led opposition to Coke and to Wesley’s authority. Many preachers were offended that Coke and Wesley seemed to be taking decision making out of the hands of the American church. They also feared that Whatcoat&#x27;s appointment would lead to the recall of Asbury, and this led the conference to reject Whatcoat&#x27;s appointment (Whatcoat would successfully be elected in 1800). In 1788, the title of superintendent was changed to bishop.

Coke&#x27;s reputation among American Methodists further suffered when his secret negotiations for a union with the Episcopal Church (as American Anglicans now styled themselves) were discovered. Coke had written and met with William White, the Episcopal Church&#x27;s presiding bishop, discussing the possible lowering of Episcopal ministerial standards, the reordination of Methodist preachers, and the reconsecration of Coke and Asbury as Episcopal bishops. When Asbury learned of the negotiations, he blocked the merger plan from being considered.

Despite controversies over authority, the Methodist Episcopal Church continued to enjoy growth. By 1788, there were 37,354 members, of which 6,545 were African American. The number of circuits had grown to 85 and the number of annual conferences had grown to six. A year later, the number of annual conferences had increased to eleven. The church&#x27;s reach also began to significantly expand beyond the Appalachian and Allegheny Mountain ranges. In 1791, a circuit was established in Upper Canada by William Losee. It was during this time that the first Methodist college in America was established, the short-lived Cokesbury College in Maryland.

This growth revealed problems with the church&#x27;s decision-making process. Each annual conference had to agree on legislation before it was enacted, but this became unwieldy when the number of conferences grew to eleven. The need for a centralized policy-making body led to the creation of a council of bishops and presiding elders (who supervised multi-circuit districts) in 1789, but this body was soon abolished after meeting only twice.

After the failure of the council, a General Conference was held in November 1792 at Baltimore. This first General Conference gave itself legislative power over the church, determined to meet every four years, and decided membership for general and annual conferences would include all elders, deacons, and traveling preachers. Local preachers and other lay members were denied voting rights.

At the General Conference, a dispute emerged over the power of bishops to assign preachers to circuits. O&#x27;Kelly and his supporters wanted the right to appeal assignments to the conference, but this proposal was defeated. In response, they left to form the Republican Methodist Church, initiating the first schism in American Methodism. As reflected in the use of the term &quot;republican&quot; in their name, Republican Methodists desired a more egalitarian church and objected to the centralized governance and episcopal polity of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The Methodist Episcopal Church lost one-fifth of its members and would not begin to experience growth again until 1800. In 1801, the Republican Methodists rejected the Methodist label and later merged with other groups to become the Christian Connection. This group was a predecessor body to the United Church of Christ.

===Organizational development, camp meetings and African-American Methodists (1793–1816)===

====Development of a constitution====
The second General Conference was held at Baltimore in October 1796. It reduced the number of annual conferences to six and, for the first time, gave them geographical boundaries. With the drawing of definite borders, it would become understood that preachers belonged to a specific annual conference. The General Conference also required that local church property be held in trust for the Methodist Episcopal Church. Local preachers were made eligible for ordination as deacons after four years of service.

Another bishop was found necessary to aid Asbury due to Coke&#x27;s frequent trips to Britain; Coke was regarded as a leading figure in Britain&#x27;s Wesleyan Methodist Church, which itself split from the Anglican Church after Wesley&#x27;s death in 1791. At the third General Conference held in May 1800, Richard Whatcoat was finally elected and consecrated the third bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

Since the annual conferences were given geographical boundaries in 1796, they increasingly acted like states, demanding proportional representation in General Conference. Because General Conference met frequently in Baltimore, it was often dominated by the conferences closest to that city, the Philadelphia and Baltimore conferences. At the 1804 General Conference, these two conferences together had 70 preachers present, while the other five conferences combined had only 42 preachers present.

To solve this problem, delegated representation for General Conference was introduced in 1808. Each annual conference was entitled to send one representative for every five conference members. The Restrictive Regulations were also adopted at this time. These rules, which were regarded as the church&#x27;s constitution, prohibited the General Conference from modifying the church&#x27;s doctrinal standards and episcopal government unless such amendments were approved all the annual conferences. William McKendree was elected the fourth bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the first American-born bishop to replace the deceased Whatcoat.

The 1812 General Conference was the first to convene under the new rules adopted in 1808. This conference, meeting in New York City, made local deacons eligible for ordination as elders. The Ohio and Tennessee Conferences were created to replace the Western Conference. This made nine in all, the others being the New York, New England, Genesee (including circuits in Upper and Lower Canada), South Carolina, Virginia, Baltimore and Philadelphia conferences.

====General Conference of 1816====
The year 1816 marked the end of an era for the MEC. Asbury and Jesse Lee died that year, and Coke had died in 1815 while conducting missionary work for the British Conference. All of these men had championed the itinerant model of ministry. Following the death of Asbury, the 1816 General Conference elected Enoch George and Robert Richford Roberts to serve as bishops along with McKendree.

The General Conference disapproved of pew rental as a means of raising funds (but this was largely ignored as more and more Methodist churches began charging pew rent). It also expressed concerns over perceived laxity in Methodist standards of discipline, doctrine, dress and sacramental practice.

There was also concern over the appearance in some places of false doctrines, such as Arianism, Socinianism and Pelagianism. In order to provide adequate preparation to candidates for the ministry, the bishops were directed to create a Course of Study featuring a prescribed reading list, the first effort to introduce a formal process for ministry preparation. The Course of Study reflected American Methodism&#x27;s continued reliance on British theologians. The reading list included Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Sermons and Notes&quot;, John Fletcher&#x27;s four-volume &quot;Checks to Antinomianism&quot;, Joseph Benson&#x27;s &quot;Sermons on Various Occasions&quot; and Coke’s six-volume &quot;Commentary on the Holy Bible&quot;. These works would guide American Methodist belief for the next century.

The General Conference placed Joshua Soule and Thomas Mason in charge of the Methodist Book Concern, the church&#x27;s publishing house. The conference also ordered the publication of a monthly periodical, &quot;The Methodist Magazine&quot;. This magazine soon acquired a circulation of 10,000 at a time when popular secular periodicals had circulations between 4,000 and 5,000. &quot;The Methodist Magazine&quot;, later renamed the &quot;Methodist Quarterly Review&quot;, was published continually from 1818 until 1932 and had a longer life than any other religious publication.

The church continued to grow during this period. Sometime around 1800, Methodism expanded into the region around Cincinnati, Ohio, and by 1807, the first Methodist church had been built in the city. In 1809, William Case was sent as a missionary to Detroit in the Michigan Territory and was followed a year later by William Mitchell, who organized what is today Central United Methodist Church and the oldest Protestant congregation in Michigan.

In 1808, Matthew P. Sturdevant established a new circuit along the banks of the Tombigbee River in Alabama. In the years 1809 and 1810, John Crane established new circuits in Upper Louisiana in what is today the state of Missouri. After the War of 1812, the Canadian conferences withdrew from the American church to become the Methodist Episcopal Church of Canada.

====Camp meetings====
The Presbyterian-led Cane Ridge Revival of 1801 birthed the first definitive camp meeting in American history, and this multi-day revivalistic event would be enthusiastically adopted by the Methodist Episcopal Church. For Methodists, these meetings were important evangelistic tools, but they were often criticized for the emotionalism and enthusiasm displayed, such as crying, shouting, jerking and falling. Methodist leaders such as Asbury expected order to be maintained, but they were not opposed to the emotional effects often seen in these meetings.

Other Methodists, such as John Fanning Watson, disagreed. In his book &quot;Methodist Error; or, Friendly, Christian Advice: To Those Methodists Who Indulge in Extravagant Religious Emotions and Bodily Exercises&quot;, published anonymously in 1814, Watson argued that such emotional displays were not appropriate on the part of converted Christians in public worship but should be restricted to the time of conversion or, for those already converted, to private devotion at home.

While historians have emphasized the importance of camp meetings on the American frontier, camp meetings were vibrant parts of Methodist community life in the more settled areas along the East Coast as well. For example, some of the most significant meetings at the start of the 19th century occurred on the Delmarva Peninsula, a place that became known as the &quot;Garden of Methodism&quot;. Camp meetings were often held simultaneously with Methodist quarterly meetings (circuit business meetings held four times each year). In America, quarterly meetings had already evolved into two-day religious festivals, so it became standard practice for quarterly conferences to make one of their warm-weather sessions a camp meeting. By 1811, Methodists held 400 to 500 camp meetings annually, and historian Nathan Hatch estimates that these events drew in over one million people annually.

====African American Methodists====
The Methodist Episcopal Church had committed itself to the antislavery cause, but it became difficult to maintain this stance as Methodism spread to slaveholding areas. To avoid alienating southerners, the 1808 General Conference allowed annual conferences to form their own policies related to buying and selling slaves. In 1816, it amended the &quot;Discipline&#x27;s&quot; prohibition on officeholders owning slaves to apply only in states where emancipation was legal.

Another problem was that the MEC failed to give African American members full equality and inclusion in the church. This failure led to the development of segregated church institutions under white supervision. In 1800, the General Conference authorized bishops to ordain African American men as local deacons. Richard Allen of Philadelphia was the first to be ordained under this rule.

Earlier in 1794, Allen had led other African American members to withdraw from St. George&#x27;s Church in response to racial discrimination by white church members. Under Allen&#x27;s leadership and with Asbury&#x27;s blessing, they founded Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church.

Under the leadership of Allen and Daniel Coker, Bethel Church and other African American congregations left the MEC to establish the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) in 1816. According to Nathan Bangs, the MEC might have lost nearly 900 African American members to the AME Church in its first year alone.

Other African American members left to form separate churches as well. A group based in Wilmington, Delaware, founded the African Union Church in 1813, and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church was formed by African American Methodists in New York City. These groups left over not receiving the prerogatives and standing within the denomination that their white counterparts were given, such as ordination, representation and property ownership. Despite these losses, however, the majority of African American Methodists remained within the MEC.

===Antebellum era (1817–1860)===
====Quest for respectability====
In the 19th century, the Methodist Episcopal Church became the largest and most widespread denomination in the United States, boasting &quot;the most extensive national organization other than the Federal government.&quot; In the Antebellum era, a new generation of leaders, upwardly mobile preachers and laity, would lead the Methodist Episcopal Church toward social respectability and inclusion within America&#x27;s Protestant establishment. In the process, the MEC would experience what some contemporaries and later interpreters considered a &quot;softening of discipline, embrace of the world, compromise of fundamental Wesleyan practices and precepts, abandonment of the evangelistic mission to society’s marginalized, and loss of Methodism’s prophetic nerve.&quot;

This included the transformation of the itinerant system into a more settled ministry. A second generation of Methodist preachers were unable to realize Wesley&#x27;s original vision of a &quot;celibate, self-sacrificing, and ascetic brotherhood&quot;. Increasingly, preachers were appointed for two-year terms to single-congregation charges called &quot;stations&quot;. This allowed stationed pastors to live in the same community every day rather than making short visits every two, four or six weeks as in earlier years. Stationing was facilitated by the construction of parsonages. By 1858, the northern MEC had built 2,174 parsonages for the use of over 5,000 traveling preachers.

Stationed preachers and their wives posed problems for the system of class meetings on which Methodist societies were based, and Methodists were noting the decline of the classes by the 1820s. The functions that class meetings and class leaders traditionally provided—discipline and spiritual formation—were taken over by the preacher and his wife. Alternative small group settings were provided by the Sunday school and the local missionary and tract societies. The meetings of these organizations featured prayer, hymns, testimony and exhortation. To accommodate these educational and missional efforts, Methodists began building larger and more impressive facilities, often on main streets, in the 1830s and 1840s.

By the 1830s, loud voices had emerged against the transformation of the denomination. These voices were nostalgic and disappointed over the end of the Asbury era, which was characterized as one of greater religious enthusiasm, revivals and camp meetings. These voices were dismissed as &quot;croakers&quot; because it seemed they never missed an opportunity to complain, whether in the pulpit, through conference sermons or on the pages of Methodist periodicals.

====New Institutions====

Nathan Bangs is credited with leading the campaign for respectability. As the denomination&#x27;s book agent and editor of both &quot;The Methodist Magazine&quot; and the weekly &quot;Christian Advocate&quot;, Bangs was the MEC&#x27;s most visible and influential leader up until the 1860s. Under his watch, the &quot;Christian Advocate&quot; became the most widely circulated periodical in the world, and the Book Concern was transformed from merely a distributor of British reprints into a full-fledged publishing house providing literature for adults, children, and Sunday schools, as well as producing tracts for the Methodist Tract Society organized in 1817.

By the 1820s, Methodists were ready to build institutions of higher education. Citing the lack of non-Calvinist colleges and seminaries, the 1820 General Conference encouraged annual conferences to establish ones under Methodist control. Around two hundred were founded by the Civil War. These included Augusta College (1822), McKendree University (1828), Wesleyan University (1831), Emory University (1836), Emory and Henry College (1836), DePauw University (originally Indiana Asbury University in 1837), and what would become the Boston University School of Theology (1839). In addition, the Methodists became affiliated with already existing Dickinson College and Allegheny College in 1833. Methodists invested in education for women as well, founding Greensboro College in North Carolina and Wesleyan College in Georgia.

====Antebellum missions====
Nathan Bangs was also instrumental in the establishment of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1819 to help support foreign mission work. While missionaries were appointed and supervised by the bishops, the missionary society raised funds to support them.

In 1834, a Liberian Annual Conference was organized. While itinerating in Liberia, Bishop Levi Scott ordained the first African deacons and elders in 1853. In 1856, the General Conference created a new position, the missionary bishop, to oversee the foreign mission fields. The Liberian Conference elected Francis Burns to be its missionary bishop, and he was consecrated in 1858, becoming the Methodist Episcopal Church&#x27;s first African American bishop. As a missionary bishop, Burns was not considered a general superintendent of the church, and his episcopal authority was limited to his assigned field.

Domestically, there were efforts among Native American tribes, such as the Wyandotte of Ohio; the Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw and Chickasaw in the Southeast; and the Ojibwe, Oneida and Chippewa of the Great Lakes region. In the late 1840s, separate Conferences were formed for German-speaking members of the Methodist Episcopal Church who were not members of the Evangelical Association or the United Brethren in Christ (later merged to form the Evangelical United Brethren (EUB)). Among these was the St. Louis German Conference, which in 1925 was assimilated into the surrounding English-speaking conferences, including the Illinois Conference.

====Origins of the holiness movement====

In 1840, Phoebe Palmer took over leadership of a prayer meeting for women in New York City begun by her sister, Sarah. Participants of what was known as the Tuesday Meeting for the Promotion of Holiness sought to receive the blessing of Christian perfection or entire sanctification. Christian perfection was a doctrine that had been taught by Wesley but had in the words of religion scholar Randall Balmer, &quot;faded into the background&quot; as Methodists gained respectability and became solidly middle class.

Palmer had experienced entire sanctification herself in 1837 when she made &quot;an entire surrender&quot; to God of everything in her life. Through her evangelism and writings, Palmer articulated an &quot;altar theology&quot; that outlined a &quot;shorter way&quot; to entire sanctification, achieved through placing oneself on a metaphorical altar by sacrificing worldly desires. Once this consecration was complete, the Christian could be assured that God would sanctify them. In the words of historian Jeffrey Williams, &quot;Palmer made sanctification an instantaneous act accomplished through the exercise of faith.&quot;

Under her leadership, men began to regularly attend the meetings, including prominent Methodists such as Nathan Bangs, Bishop Leonidas Hamline, and Stephen Olin. By the 1850s, people from nearly every Protestant denomination were attending the meetings and similar meetings were started around the country, eventually numbering around 200 by 1886. These meetings formed the impetus for a new interdenominational holiness movement promoted by such publications as the &quot;Guide to Christian Perfection&quot;, which published written testimonies from those who had experienced entire sanctification. The movement was largely urban and mainly led by lay people.

====Conflict over episcopal polity and abolitionism====
In the 1820s, a reform movement emerged within the Methodist Episcopal Church to challenge its hierarchical structure. In particular, reformers wanted presiding elders to be chosen by conference elections rather than episcopal appointment. They also desired representation for local preachers (two-thirds of all Methodist clergy) and lay people in annual and general conferences. These proposals, particularly election of presiding elders, were interpreted as a threat to the church&#x27;s episcopal polity and, therefore, a violation of the Restrictive Regulations according to Bishop McKendree and Joshua Soule, author of the restrictive rules.

In the aftermath of the 1824 General Conference, a number of &quot;union societies&quot; were formed to advocate for reform, while church leaders took actions to suppress any effort to alter the church&#x27;s episcopal polity. Presiding elders in the Baltimore Conference began disciplinary proceedings against twenty-five laymen and eleven local preachers for advocating reform. Meanwhile, the number of union societies grew. The refusal of the 1828 General Conference to endorse democratic reforms led to a definitive division within the church and the organization of the Methodist Protestant Church.
In 1820 (the same year as the Missouri Compromise), the Methodist Episcopal Church ended its ban on preachers and leadership owning slaves. Around the same time, it became closely tied to the American Colonization Society and its own Liberian Mission, which proposed sending freedmen to evangelize Africa. According to historian Donald Mathews, &quot;[T]here was no religious denomination more closely connected with colonization than the Methodist Episcopal Church&quot;.

In the 1830s, abolitionists within the Methodist Episcopal Church sought to recover the church&#x27;s antislavery witness. Notable abolitionist activity took place within the New England Annual Conference where Orange Scott and others used camp meetings and conference structures to attack slavery and the suppression of antislavery sentiments in church publications. Despite their efforts, Nathan Bangs kept abolitionist messages out of church periodicals, and the bishops also sought to suppress abolitionists for the sake of church unity. Abolitionist clergy were censured, brought up on disciplinary charges, and appointed to difficult assignments as punishment. Southern Methodists responded by defending the morality of slavery and asserting that, as a political matter, slavery was an issue that was outside of the church&#x27;s authority to adjudicate.

When pro-slavery forces prevailed at the 1840 General Conference, Scott and his allies La Roy Sunderland and Jotham Horton left the church. Condemning the MEC as &quot;not only a slave-holding, but a slavery defending, Church,&quot; these men organized a new Methodist church on explicitly abolitionist grounds in 1843 called the Wesleyan Methodist Church (not to be confused with the British church of the same name).

====Southern schism of 1844====
Despite the Wesleyan Methodist secession, the anti-slavery movement among northern Methodists continued to grow, with conferences passing anti-slavery resolutions preceding the 1844 General Conference. Over the objections of southerners, General Conference created a committee on slavery that recommended the conference act to &quot;separate slavery from the church&quot;. Most damaging to church unity, the General Conference ordered Bishop James Osgood Andrew, a slave owner, to &quot;desist from the exercise of this office so long as this impediment remains&quot; on the basis that his owning slaves would prevent him from effectively ministering as a bishop in the North.

A committee of nine was appointed to study the possibility of an amicable separation of the church. It proposed a Plan of Separation that would provide for determining a geographic boundary between the two churches and a peaceful division of property, such as the Book Concern and the pension resources of the Chartered Fund. Despite concerns that this proposal would cause &quot;war and strife in the border conferences&quot;, it was approved by General Conference. As it required an amendment to the Restrictive Regulations, however, the plan had to be ratified by three-fourths of the annual conferences and was rejected by the northern conferences.

Nevertheless, the southern conferences proceeded with the Plan of Separation at the Louisville Convention of 1845 and held the first General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MECS) in 1846. This action started a contest between northern and southern conferences to recruit as many border stations and circuits as they could, especially in the Delmarva Peninsula, western Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Missouri. Meanwhile, the 1848 MEC General Conference declared that the Plan of Separation had failed to receive the required conference votes and could not be used to legally divide the church. The dispute over the legality of separation and division of the Book Concern&#x27;s property was not resolved until 1853 when the US Supreme Court rule in Smith v. Swormstedt that the creation of the MECS was legal.

====Free Methodist schism of 1860====
Northern anger surrounding the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 brought further turmoil to the MEC. The Genesee Conference in New York was most effected. There, reform-minded Methodists led by B. T. Roberts protested slavery as well as other signs of cultural accommodation, such as pew rents (which alienated the poor) and the decline in revivalism and holiness teaching. The conference leadership reacted to this by harassing and expelling Roberts and his colleagues who then went on to organize the Free Methodist Church in 1860.

Concerned about defections to the Free Methodists, the 1860 General Conference declared owning slaves to be &quot;contrary to the laws of God and nature&quot; and inconsistent with the church&#x27;s rules. This sparked a wave of petitions from border conferences demanding a return to a neutral position on slavery. The Baltimore annual conference split in half, with pro-slavery members seceding from the MEC. Kentucky and Missouri would soon become religious battlegrounds as Methodists divided into pro-Union and pro-Confederate camps.

===Civil War and Reconstruction (1861–1877)===

The Methodist split over slavery paralleled a national split. The controversy over slavery led the Southern states to secede from the Union and form the Confederate States of America, actions that led to the American Civil War. No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the Methodist Episcopal Church. Historian Richard Carwardine argues that for many Methodists, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election as US president in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the terror unleashed on godly abolitionists, release from the Slave Power&#x27;s evil grip on the state, and a new direction for the Union.

Methodists contributed many chaplains to the Union Army and were heavily involved in the Christian Commission, a Protestant organization that provided religious services to soldiers and contributed to revivals within the army between 1863 and 1865. The Methodist family magazine &quot;Ladies&#x27; Repository&quot;, which provided moral uplift to women and children, promoted Christian family activism. It portrayed the War as a great moral crusade against a decadent Southern civilization corrupted by slavery. It recommended activities that family members could perform in order to aid the Union cause.

While the MEC was overwhelmingly supportive of the war effort, a minority of northern Methodists disagreed with the church&#x27;s political stance. In Ohio, Methodists who sympathized with the anti-war Copperheads coalesced into a new denomination, the Christian Union.
After the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat, Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the Radical Republicans with their hard line toward the white South. The Methodist Ministers Association of Boston, meeting two weeks after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, called for a hard line against the Confederate leadership:
In a highly controversial move, the Northern MEC used the army to seize control of Methodist churches in large Southern cities over the vehement protests of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Historian Ralph Morrow reports:
During Reconstruction, Northern denominations all sent missionaries, teachers and activists to the South to help the Freedmen. Only the Methodists made many converts, however. Activists sponsored by the northern Methodist church played a major role in the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, notably in such key educational roles as the Bureau&#x27;s state superintendent or assistant superintendent of education for Virginia, Florida, Alabama and South Carolina.

The focus on social problems paved the way for the Social Gospel movement a few years later. Matthew Simpson, a famous bishop, played a leading role in mobilizing the Northern Methodists for the cause. His biographer calls him the &quot;High Priest of the Radical Republicans.&quot; MEC women would use the leadership and organizational skills gained during the war to establish orphanages and old age homes. A major driver in the creation of such institutions was the Woman&#x27;s Home Missionary Society, founded in 1882.

===Post–Civil War divisions===
In 1895, during the 19th century holiness movement, Methodist Episcopal minister Phineas F. Bresee founded the Church of the Nazarene in Los Angeles with the help of Joseph Pomeroy Widney. The Church of the Nazarene separated over a perceived need to minister further to the urban poor, the origins of its Nazarene name. Several other churches, roughly 15 holiness denominations that had also split from the Methodist Episcopal Church, joined the Church of the Nazarene in 1907 and 1908, and it became international soon thereafter. The new Church of the Nazarene retained the Methodist Episcopal tradition of education and now operates 56 educational institutions around the world, including eight liberal arts colleges in the United States, each tied to an &quot;educational region&quot;.

==Beliefs and standards==
The Methodist Episcopal Church&#x27;s doctrines are the Articles of Religion along with an emphasis on &quot;Universal Redemption, the Free Agency of Man, Regeneration or the New Birth, Adoption, the Witness of the Spirit, and Entire Sanctification or Perfect Love.&quot; Probationers who sought full membership into the Methodist Episcopal Church affirmed &quot;a desire to flee from the wrath to come, and to be saved from their sins&quot; which was to be evidenced by &quot;observing the General Rules&quot; delineated the connexion&#x27;s standards.

Its standards included a ban against marriages with unconverted persons; a prohibition on the buying, selling and use of spiritous liquors; abstinence from tobacco; and an injunction not to wear &quot;gold and costly apparel&quot;. The Methodist Episcopal Church forbade the &quot;singing of those songs, or reading those books, which do not tend to the knowledge or love of God&quot; as well as &quot;dancing; playing at games of chance; attending theaters, horse races, circuses, dancing parties, or patronizing dancing schools, or taking such other amusements as are obviously of misleading or questionable moral tendency.&quot;

==Divisions and mergers==
The following list notes divisions and mergers that occurred in Methodist Episcopal Church history.

1767: The Rev. Philip William Otterbein, (1726–1813) of Baltimore and Martin Boehm started Methodist evangelism among German-speaking immigrants to form the United Brethren in Christ. This development had to do only with language. Methodist Episcopal Bishop Francis Asbury later preached at Otterbein&#x27;s 1813 funeral. In 1968 it merged to form the United Methodist Church.

1784: Historic &quot;Christmas Conference&quot; held at Lovely Lane Chapel in waterfront Baltimore (at Lovely Lane, off German (now Redwood) Street between South Calvert Street and South Street) and convened to organize the future Methodist Episcopal Church and also several ministers ordain Francis Asbury as bishop.

1793: The first recognized split from the Methodist Episcopal Church was led by a preacher named James O&#x27;Kelly who wanted clergy to be free to refuse to serve where the bishop appointed them. He organized the &quot;Republican Methodists,&quot; later called simply the Christian Church or Christian Connection, that through its successors and mergers eventually became part of the future United Church of Christ in 1957.

1800: The Evangelical Association was organized by Jacob Albright to serve German-speaking Methodists.

1813: The Reformed Methodist Church was organized under the leadership of Methodist preachers Pliny Brett and Elijah Bailey. This group was concentrated in Massachusetts and Vermont. It merged into the Churches of Christ in Christian Union in 1952.

1816: The African Methodist Episcopal Church was organized in Philadelphia by Richard Allen for Wesley followers/African-Americans. Bishop Francis Asbury had ordained him earlier in 1799.

1820: The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church was organized in New York.

1828: The Canadians formed their own Methodist Church.

1828: The Methodist Protestant Church split off under Nicholas Snethen, who had earlier argued against the O&#x27;Kelly split, along with Asa Shinn. The issue was the role of laity in governance of the church. In 1939, it merged.

1843: The Wesleyan Methodist Church was organized. In 1968, the Wesleyan Methodist and Pilgrim Holiness denominations merged to form the Wesleyan Church.

1844: The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, split off because of the slavery controversy. Briefly, during the American Civil War, 1861–1865, it adopted the title of &quot;The Methodist Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America&quot;. In 1939, it merged into The Methodist Church, (which endures until 1968 and a subsequent merger with the Evangelical United Brethren Church forming the current U.M.C.).

1860: The Free Methodist Church was organized by B. T. Roberts and others. The differences centered around a traditional/rural vs. modern/urban ethos.

1870: The Colored Methodist Episcopal Church was organized from the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, to serve African-American Methodists. Later changed its name to Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.

1895: The Church of the Nazarene was organized by Phineas F. Bresee.

1895: Fire Baptized Holiness Church

1897: Pentecostal Holiness Church of North Carolina. Merged with the Fire Baptized Holiness Church in 1911 and formed what is now known as the International Pentecostal Holiness Church.

1897: The Pilgrim Holiness Church was organized.

1939: The Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant Church merged to form The Methodist Church.

1946: The Evangelical Church (Albright&#x27;s Evangelical Association) and Otterbein&#x27;s heritage in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church.

1968: The Evangelical United Brethren Church and The Methodist Church merged to form The United Methodist Church.

<text>The Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MEC, S; also Methodist Episcopal Church South) was the American Methodist denomination resulting from the 19th-century split over the issue of slavery in the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC). Disagreement on this issue had been increasing in strength for decades between churches of the Northern and Southern United States; in 1845 it resulted in a schism at the General Conference of the MEC held in Louisville, Kentucky.

This body maintained its own polity for nearly 100 years until the formation in 1939 of the Methodist Church, uniting the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, with the older Methodist Episcopal Church and much of the Methodist Protestant Church, which had separated from Methodist Episcopal Church in 1828. The Methodist Church in turn merged in 1968 with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form the United Methodist Church, one of the largest and most widely spread Christian denominations in America.

In 1940, some more theologically conservative MEC,S congregations, which dissented from the 1939 merger, formed the Southern Methodist Church, which still exists as a small, conservative denomination headquartered in South Carolina. Some dissenting congregations from the Methodist Protestant Church also objected to the 1940 merger and continue as a separate denomination, headquartered in Mississippi.

==History==

John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, was appalled by slavery in the British colonies. When the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) was founded in the United States at the &quot;Christmas Conference&quot; synod meeting of ministers at the Lovely Lane Chapel in Baltimore in December 1784, the denomination officially opposed slavery very early. Numerous Methodist missionaries toured the South in the &quot;Great Awakening&quot; and tried to convince slaveholders to manumit the people whom they enslaved. In the first two decades after the American Revolutionary War, a number did free people from slavery. The number of free blacks increased markedly at this time, especially in the Upper South.

During the early nineteenth century, Methodists and Baptists in the South began to modify their approach in order to gain support from common planters, and yeomen. They began to argue for better treatment of slaves, saying that the Bible acknowledged slavery but that Christianity had a paternalistic role to improve conditions.

The invention of the cotton gin had enabled profitable cultivation of cotton in new areas of the South, increasing the demand for slaves. Manumissions nearly ceased and, after slave rebellions, the states made them extremely difficult to accomplish. Northern Methodist congregations increasingly opposed slavery, and some members began to be active in the abolitionist movement. The southern church accommodated it as part of a legal system.

But, even in the South, Methodist clergy were not supposed to own slaves. In 1840, the Rev. James Osgood Andrew, a bishop living in Oxford, Georgia, bought a woman. Fearing that she would end up with an inhumane owner if sold, Andrew kept her but let her work independently. The 1840 MEC General Conference considered the matter, but did not expel Andrew. Four years later, Andrew married a woman who owned a slave inherited from her mother, making the bishop the owner of two people. As bishop, he was considered to have obligations both in the North and South and was criticized for owning slaves.

The 1844 General Conference voted to suspend Bishop Andrew from exercising his episcopal office until he was no longer a slave owner. Southern delegates to the conference disputed the authority of a General Conference to discipline bishops. The cultural differences that had divided the nation during the mid-19th century were also dividing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The 1844 dispute led Methodists in the South to break off and form a separate denomination, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MEC,S). Delegates from the southern conferences met at a Convention at the Fourth Street Church in Louisville, Kentucky, May 1–19, 1845, and organized the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.

==Civil War==
The statistics for 1859 showed the MEC,S had as enrolled members some 511,601 whites and 197,000 blacks (nearly all of whom were slaves), and 4,200 Indians. In 1858 MEC,S operated 106 schools and colleges.

The American Civil War resulted in widespread destruction of property, including church buildings and institutions, but it was marked by a series of strong revivals that began in General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army and spread throughout the region. Chaplains tended the wounded after the battles. John Berry McFerrin (1807–1887) recalled: 
===African Americans===
After the Civil War, when African American slaves gained freedom, many left the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. They joined either the independent black denominations of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded in Philadelphia or the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church founded in New York, but some also joined the (Northern) Methodist Episcopal Church, which planted new congregations in the South. The two independent black denominations both sent missionaries to the South after the war to aid freedmen, and attracted hundreds of thousands of new members, from both Baptists and Methodists, and new converts to Christianity. Out of 200,000 African-American members in the MEC,S in 1860, by 1866 only 49,000 remained.

in 1870, most of the remaining African-American members of the MEC,S split off on friendly terms with white colleagues to form the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, (Christian Methodist Episcopal Church since 1954), taking with them $1.5 million in buildings and properties. The new denomination avoided the Republican politics of the AME and AME Zion congregations. It had more than 3,000 churches, more than 1,200 traveling preachers, 2,500 church-based preachers, about 140,000 members, and held 22 annual conferences, presided over by four bishops.

===Growth in late 19th century===
The MEC,S energetically tended its base: in 1880 it had 798,862 members (mostly white), and 1,066,377 in 1886. It expanded its missionary activity in Mexico. Although usually avoiding politics, MEC,S in 1886 denounced divorce and called for Prohibition, stating: 
After 1844 the Methodists in the South increased their emphasis on an educated clergy. Ambitious young preachers from humble, rural backgrounds attended college, and were often appointed to serve congregations in towns. There they could build larger churches that paid decent salaries; they gained social prestige in a highly visible community leadership position. These ministers turned the pulpit into a profession, thus emulating the Presbyterians and Episcopalians. They created increasingly complex denominational bureaucracies to meet a series of pressing needs: defending slavery, evangelizing soldiers during the Civil War, promoting temperance reform, contributing to foreign missions (see American Southern Methodist Episcopal Mission), and supporting local colleges. The new urban middle-class ministry increasingly left their country cousins far behind. As the historian of the transformation explains, &quot;Denomination building—that is, the bureaucratization of religion in the late antebellum South—was an inherently innovative and forward-looking task. It was, in a word, modern.&quot;

The returns for 1892 showed:
* Traveling preachers: 5,368
* Local preachers: 6,481
* White members: 1,282,750
* Colored members: 357
* Indian members: 10,759
** Total: 1,305,715
* Sunday-schools: 13,426
* SS teachers: 95,204
* SS students: 754,223
* Churches: 12,856
* Value: $20,287,112

====Education====

Methodist education had suffered during the Civil War, as most academies were closed. Some recovered in the late 19th century, but demand decreased as public education had been established for the first time by Reconstruction-era legislatures across the South. It was generally a segregated system, and racial segregation was established by law for public facilities under Jim Crow rules conditions in the late 19th century, after white Democrats regained control of state legislatures in the late 1870s.

The colleges were in scarcely better condition, though philanthropy of the late 19th and early 20th centuries dramatically changed their development. Most were primarily high-school level academies offering a few collegiate courses. The dramatic exception was Vanderbilt University, at Nashville, with a million-dollar campus and an endowment of $900,000, thanks to the Vanderbilt family. Much smaller and poorer were Randolph-Macon College in Virginia, with its two affiliated fitting-schools and Randolph-Macon Woman&#x27;s College; Emory College, in Atlanta (as the infusion of Candler family money was far in the future); Emory &amp; Henry, in Southwest Virginia; Wofford, with its two fitting-schools, in South Carolina; Trinity, in North Carolina—soon to be endowed by the Duke family and change its name; Central, in Missouri; Southern, in Alabama; Southwestern, in Texas; Wesleyan, in Kentucky; Millsaps, in Mississippi; Centenary, in Louisiana; Hendrix, in Arkansas; and Pacific, in California.

The growing need for a theology school west of the Mississippi River was not addressed until the founding of Southern Methodist University in Texas in 1911. The denomination also supported several women&#x27;s colleges, although they were more like finishing schools or academies until the twentieth century. At that time, they were developed to meet the standards of new accrediting agencies, such as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The oldest Methodist woman&#x27;s college is Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia; other Methodist colleges that were formerly women&#x27;s institutions are Lagrange College and Andrew College in Georgia, Columbia College in South Carolina, and Greensboro College in North Carolina.

In March 1900, the East Columbia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church-South purchased an existing school called Milton Academy, built by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Milton, Oregon. Renamed &quot;Columbia College&quot;, it opened September 24, 1900 under Methodist leadership. Due to declining enrollment and lack of funds, the school was closed in 1925. First year enrollment was 131 pupils, under Dean W.C. Howard. The original wood building was replaced in 1910 by a four-story stone building. It has been adapted for use as the city hall of the combined cities of Milton-Freewater, Oregon.

====Women====

In the 1930s, the MEC and the Methodist Protestant Church, other Methodist denominations still operating in the South, agreed to ordain women either as local elders and deacons (the MEC) or full clergy (the Methodist Protestant Church). The MEC,S did not ordain women as pastors at the time of the 1939 merger that formed the Methodist Church.

==Legacy==
The MEC,S was responsible for founding four of the South&#x27;s top divinity schools: Vanderbilt University Divinity School, Duke Divinity School, Candler School of Theology at Emory University, and Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University. Vanderbilt severed its ties with the denomination in 1914. Duke, Candler, and Perkins maintain a relationship with the United Methodist Church. All four enroll students who are primarily from mainline Protestant denominations, but religion is not a test for admittance. The denomination&#x27;s publishing house, opened in 1854 in Nashville, Tennessee, eventually became the headquarters of the United Methodist Publishing House. See Abingdon Press and Cokesbury.

<text>The Methodist Protestant Church (MPC) is a Methodist denomination of Christianity that is based in the United States. It was formed in 1828 by former members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, being Wesleyan in doctrine and worship, but adopting congregational governance.

A majority of the Methodist Protestants merged with the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1939, and for that reason, the historic Methodist Protestant Church is regarded as one of the predecessors of the present-day United Methodist Church. The Mississippi MPC delegation to the 1939 Uniting Conference withdrew from the proceedings, due to worries about developing liberal elements within the UMC; most of the congregations in the Mississippi conference reorganized and continued as the Methodist Protestant Church in name, doctrine and practice. 

In 2024, the MPC headquarters are in Mississippi.

As of 2008, the MPC consists of 42 churches in the United States, located in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma and a mission conference in the country of Belize.

==History==
===A Methodist reform movement begins===
The particular issue which would eventually give rise to the organization of the Methodist Protestant Church was one of Church governance rather than doctrine. Dissatisfaction among some Methodists with regard to the increasingly exclusive power of the clergy, particularly bishops, and the exclusion of laymen from the councils of the Church, including the Annual (regional) and General (national) Conferences.

===Establishment===

In response to actual and threatened expulsions, a convention was held in Baltimore, November 12, 1828, an initial organization was formed with the provisional name of &quot;The Associated Methodist Churches,&quot; temporary Articles of Association adopted, and its first General Conference scheduled for 1830. The intervening time was used to form local churches and organized into annual (regional) conferences. Fourteen Annual Conferences were represented by one hundred and fourteen delegates at the first General Conference, called to order on November 2, 1830. The delegates adopted the permanent name &quot;Methodist Protestant Church&quot; to denote its connection to the reform movement, adopted a Constitution and Discipline reflecting the representative form the reformers had sought within the Methodist Episcopal Church. Unlike the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Protestant Church rejected the use of bishops. In the MEC, the bishops had the power to appoint pastors to local churches. The Methodist Protestant Church appointed pastors by a president of the conference. The conference then affirmed the appointment.

===Reunification and organized dissent===

After the formation of the Methodist Protestant Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church had become further fractured by the corresponding division of the nation during the American Civil War. At the conclusion of that military conflict, the corresponding division between Northern and Southern Methodist Episcopal Churches remained. While discussion toward reunification went forward slowly, many of the democratic reforms of church governance were adopted which had led to a separate Methodist Protestant Church. Consequently, the reunification process was broadened to include all three major &quot;streams&quot; of American Methodism, and resulted in a Uniting Convention being convened in 1939 with representatives of the General and Annual Conferences of the three separate bodies as delegates.

Some of the original differences between Methodist Protestant Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church remained unresolved. Additionally, many Methodist Protestants objected to liberalization on the part of the Methodist Episcopal Church with respect to the inspiration and authority of the Scriptures, the deity of Christ and Wesley&#x27;s teachings on the work of the Holy Spirit. This opinion was the minority view in most Methodist Protestant Annual Conferences, the Mississippi Conference being the sole exception. The Uniting Convention proceeded to effect the merger, which formed The Methodist Church, which in 1968 merged with the Evangelical United Brethren to form the United Methodist Church. Those who objected to the merger continued as the Methodist Protestant Church.

<text>La Vieille Taupe is a publishing house and bookshop in Paris, France. The establishment went through two distinct phases in its history. Between 1965 and 1972, it had a politically ultra-left slant. In 1980 a project with the same name was launched by one of La Vieille Taupe&#x27;s previous participants and became renowned for publishing antisemitic and Holocaust denial literature.

== Ultra-Left origins==
The name means &quot;Old Mole&quot; and comes from a communist conception of the maturation of social forces beneath the surface of society which eventually erupt in revolutionary movements. The bookshop was founded in 1965 at 1, rue des Fossés-Saint-Jacques, Paris 5eme. It was the major source for texts by the Situationist International, Amadeo Bordiga and other ultra-left groups. Marx&#x27;s Theses on Feuerbach were available as a poster thanks to Guy Debord. The situationists did much of the fly postering and along with Pouvoir Ouvrier who turned up for the opening party.

In 1966 the Situationists fell out with La Vieille Taupe and withdrew their publications. The bookshop continued as a focus of ultraleft activity until its closure in 1972. In 1973 La Vieille Taupe published &quot;La gauche allemande: Textes du KAPD, de L&#x27;AAUD, de L&#x27;AAUE et de la KAI (1920-1922) &quot;with La Vecchia Talpa (Naples) and Invariance.</text><links>

<text>Georgina Beyer (November 1957 – 6 March 2023) was a New Zealand Labour Party politician who represented Wairarapa in the Parliament of New Zealand from 1999 to 2005, after serving as mayor of Carterton from 1995 to 1999. Beyer was the world&#x27;s first openly transgender mayor, and the world&#x27;s first openly transgender member of parliament. As a member of the Labour Party Beyer supported progressive policies including prostitution law reform, civil unions, anti-discrimination laws, and the promotion of Māori rights. She resigned in 2007, and, in 2014, unsuccessfully stood for election on behalf of the Mana Party.

==Early life==

Born in 1957 at Wellington Hospital to Noeline (née Tamati) and Jack Bertrand and assigned male at birth, she was named after her grandfather, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, who was second in command in the Māori Battalion. Her parents were living in Hataitai at the time of her birth. She was of European and Māori (Te Āti Awa, Ngāti Mutunga, Ngāti Raukawa, and Ngāti Porou) descent. Her mother had a second child with her first husband in December 1958, who was placed for adoption. Beyer was sent to live with her grandparents on their farm in Taranaki during this second pregnancy. Her parents divorced by 1962.

Her mother married again in 1962. Her mother&#x27;s second husband was Colin Beyer, a recent law school graduate. The couple moved to Upper Hutt. Beyer, now aged four and a half years, returned to live with her mother and stepfather. Her brother was born in December 1963. Beyer attended Upper Hutt Primary School and from age seven, after the family moved to the Wellington suburb of Crofton Downs, Ngaio School. With marital problems developing between her mother and her stepfather, Beyer was sent to Wellesley College boarding school, where she attempted suicide amid feelings of rejection by her parents. From Form 2, she attended the school as a day pupil, as the hostel had closed. After her parents&#x27; marriage ended in 1971, financial constraints meant that a private school was no longer affordable, and Beyer attended Onslow College in Form 3. Beyer then moved with her mother and brother to Papatoetoe to be near family and friends, with Beyer attending Papatoetoe High School. Before enrolment, a legal surname change by deed poll from &quot;Bertrand&quot; to &quot;Beyer&quot; meant that the difference in family name did not have to be explained at school. It was also seen as socially advantageous for Beyer to be linked to her successful stepfather. Beyer began acting while at that school and decided to make a career out of it, leaving school at 16 (against her mother&#x27;s will).

Beyer lived in Australia for some time, and in 1979 experienced a traumatic sexual assault in Sydney; she felt unable to seek help from the police, which led her to start thinking about a political career. On her return to New Zealand she began seeking work as an actor with increasing success, culminating in a GOFTA award nomination for best female performance for the television drama &quot;Jewel&#x27;s Darl&quot; in 1987. In 1984, Beyer underwent gender-affirming surgery.

Beyer became a part of the Wellington gay nightclub scene, initially as a singer and drag queen performer, and later as a sex worker. After moving to Carterton, in the Wairarapa, she worked as a radio host. Beyer was the local news presenter and part of the inaugural breakfast crew on radio station Today FM, then owned by Paul Henry (whom she later defeated in the 1999 general election).

==Political career==

===Carterton===
After her return to New Zealand and move to Carterton, Beyer began to take an interest in local politics, first winning election to a local school board. She was elected mayor of Carterton in 1995, which made her the world&#x27;s first openly transgender mayor, as well as the first female mayor of Carterton and first Māori mayor in the Wairarapa district. In 1996, Wellington mayor Mark Blumsky said he thought she was &quot;very good at her job&quot;. In 1998 she was re-elected with 90% of the vote. In 2000, she resigned, following her election to Parliament; in 2004 she said resigning was one of her biggest regrets.

===Parliament===

At the 1999 general election, Beyer was selected as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for the electorate. She surprised political commentators by winning the typically right-leaning electorate, with a 3,033-vote majority over former colleague and National candidate Paul Henry, and becoming the world&#x27;s first transgender Member of Parliament. In her maiden speech, Beyer said:

At the , Beyer re-contested Wairarapa for Labour. She was easily re-elected with an increased majority of 6,372 votes.

In 2001, Annie Goldson and Peter Wells co-directed a documentary film about Beyer called &quot;Georgie Girl&quot;. It received a number of awards including the Excellence in Documentary Award at the 2002 San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival and the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the 2002 Sydney Film Festival. Interviewed in the film, Beyer said: &quot;I get asked questions no other politician would ever have to answer. Regarding the surgery, you know. &#x27;Did it hurt?&#x27;, or, &#x27;When you have sex now as a woman, is it different to how you had sex as a man?&#x27; Well, honey, obviously.&quot;

===Views===
As an MP, Beyer supported progressive policies such as LGBTQ rights and Māori rights. In her speech to Parliament on the Prostitution Reform Act 2003, which decriminalised prostitution in New Zealand, she identified herself as a former sex worker. She influenced three MPs to vote for the Bill, which passed with 60 votes for, 59 against with one abstention. She then supported the Civil Union Act 2004, which legalised civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples at a time when gay marriage was still not an option in New Zealand. She confronted followers of Destiny Church on the steps of the Parliament building during their protest against the bill.

In 2001 Beyer supported the addition of sexual orientation as a ground of prohibited discrimination under the Human Rights Act 1993. In 2004 she put forward a member&#x27;s bill that would add gender identity a prohibited ground. She withdrew the bill after the Solicitor-General provided a legal opinion confirming that gender identity was already covered by existing law.

Beyer supported use of the Māori language by government and public institutions, and was instrumental to the passage of the Māori Language Act 2003. She personally opposed the government&#x27;s seabed and foreshore legislation of May 2004, but voted in favour of it due to her electorate&#x27;s preferences. She asked the Labour Party if she could abstain from the vote but was refused; she later said that vowed that &quot;from that time on that I would never be torn between who and what I am as far as my heritage is concerned, and political expediency&quot;.

===Retirement===
In early 2004, Beyer announced that she would not stand in the 2005 elections. Tension with her electorate committee, which opposed Beyer&#x27;s views on the seabed and foreshore, may also have contributed to the decision. In September, Beyer changed her mind. She announced that she would seek a position on the Labour list, without recontesting the Wairarapa seat. She stated that a rally by the conservative Destiny Church the previous month had influenced her decision, as she believed that the message of such rallies must be opposed. A year later, she decided again she would resign.

Beyer resigned from parliament effective from 15 February 2007, and gave her valedictory speech to Parliament on the previous day.

In 2010, Beyer stated that she was struggling financially since leaving politics and was applying for welfare.

===2014 Mana candidacy for Te Tai Tonga===
On 27 July 2014, the Mana Party announced that Beyer would stand for Mana in the constituency in the 2014 New Zealand general election.

Beyer was critical of the Internet-Mana alliance. She expressed her wariness towards Kim Dotcom, saying that &quot;he [was] using his power and position to seek retribution on people who have done him wrong&quot;, and wished that he would have taken a backseat in campaigning. She further criticised Dotcom for &quot;pulling the strings&quot; behind Internet-Mana. Beyer believed the relationship between the two parties was not mutually beneficial, considering that Mana candidates did not receive equal treatment within the partnership. She said that her campaign ran on &quot;thin air&quot;, and later refused to participate on the national tour.

Beyer regarded her 2014 candidacy as &quot;a way of making amends to Māori for voting for the foreshore and seabed bill&quot;. After it was unsuccessful, she said her candidacy was a personal favour to her acquaintance Hone Harawira and that she had not expected to win.

==Public speaking==

Beyer was a keynote speaker at the first International Conference on LGBT Human Rights in Montreal in 2006 and the second International Conference in Copenhagen in 2009, as well as for the Egale Canada Human Rights Trust&#x27;s annual Gala, held in Toronto on 24 September 2010.

Beyer was invited as a speaker to a public event at Oxford University&#x27;s debating society Oxford Union on 23 October 2018, and at the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Cambridge Union on 31 October 2018. She was the first person of Māori descent to address the Oxford Union.

==Honours and awards==
In 2000, Beyer was voted Supreme Queer of the Year at the Queer of the Year Awards.

In the 2020 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Beyer was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to LGBTIQA+ rights. Beyer said of the honour:

==Kidney transplant and death==
Beyer was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2013. During the 2014 election, and until she received a transplant in 2017, she received kidney dialysis four times a day, seven days a week. After receiving her transplant she resumed public appearances.

Beyer died on 6 March 2023 at the Mary Potter Hospice in Wellington, at age 65. Wairarapa MP Kieran McAnulty, whom she babysat, described her as &quot;a beloved family member, loyal friend, passionate advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community and a powerhouse of a local politician&quot;, and prime minister Chris Hipkins said she &quot;has blazed a trail that makes it much easier for others to follow&quot;. Finance minister Grant Robertson said he will always remember her courage. Former prime minister Helen Clark said her popularity grew from her honesty. A street in a new housing development in Carterton will be named Georgina Beyer Way in her honour.

<text>United Poultry Concerns is a national non-profit animal rights organization in the United States that addresses the treatment of poultry, including chickens, ducks and turkeys, in food production, science, education, entertainment, and human companionship situations. The organization was founded in 1990 by the animal rights advocate and writer Karen Davis.

According to their website:
The article title and slogan &quot;Turkeys are Friends, not Food&quot; may afford a glimpse into the &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; for the organisation.

<text>Karen Davis (February 4, 1944 – November 4, 2023) was an American animal rights advocate, and president of United Poultry Concerns, a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to address the treatment of domestic fowl—including chickens, turkeys, and ducks—in factory farming. Davis also maintained a sanctuary.

Davis was the author of several books on veganism and animal rights, including &quot;Prisoned Chickens, Poisoned Eggs: An Inside Look at the Modern Poultry Industry&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Holocaust and the Henmaid&#x27;s Tale: A Case for Comparing Atrocities&quot; (2005). Karen Davis also wrote the foreword to Michael Lanfield&#x27;s book, &quot;The Interconnectedness of Life&quot;, which was released December 6, 2014.

==Early life and education==
Karen Davis was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania; her parents were Mary Elizabeth Davis, a French tutor, and Amos Davis, an attorney and hunter. Amos was the Blair County District attorney from 1966 to 1975. 

Davis graduated from Hollidaysburg Area High School in 1962. She studied for her undergraduate degree at Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania. 

While in college, she became extremely unsettled by stories of concentration camps and eventually dropped out, according her obituary in the Wall Street Journal.

Davis obtained her PhD in English from the University of Maryland, College Park. She also taught English at the University of Maryland while she started United Poultry Concerns.

==Activism==

&quot;Just as I became obsessed with concentration camps in the early 1960s, so in the early 1970s I began to agonize over the suffering and abuse of nonhuman animals,&quot; Davis wrote, per the Wall Street Journal.

At the time, she was more or less alone in advocating the rights of poultry. Despite this, Davis “never missed an opportunity to show people that these were intelligent, loving, beautiful animals,&quot; Ingrid Newkirk, the founder of PETA, told the Journal. &quot;She was one of the original pioneers who changed the conversation around chickens.”

She regularly addressed the annual National Animal Rights conferences, and was inducted in July 2002 into the Animal Rights Hall of Fame &quot;for outstanding contributions to animal liberation.&quot; Since 1999, she and United Poultry Concerns hosted 19 conferences on farmed animal-vegan advocacy issues. 

Davis launched a campaign against National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;This American Life&quot; for its annual &quot;Poultry Slam&quot; show, arguing that host Ira Glass was contributing to the poor treatment and slaughter of chickens and turkeys. Eventually, Glass visited Davis&#x27;s sanctuary and announced on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in 2008 that he had become a vegetarian thanks to Davis.

Davis was one of several people who provided information used in the writing of the book &quot;Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism&quot; (2008) by Mark Hawthorne.

Davis paid for an advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in protest at the practice of killing chickens in the streets of New York during the Yom Kippur ritual of kapparot.

==Personal life and death==
Davis married George Allan Cate. She had three brothers: Tim Davis of Palo Alto, California, Amos Davis of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Andrew Davis of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania.

Davis was sick for two years after a fall in 2021, during which she kept her illness private. She died at the UPC sanctuary on November 4, 2023, at the age of 79.

<text>An adit (from Latin &quot;aditus&quot;, entrance) or stulm
is a horizontal or nearly horizontal passage to an underground mine.
Miners can use adits for access, drainage, ventilation, and extracting minerals at the lowest convenient level. Adits are also used to explore for mineral veins. Although most strongly associated with mining, the term &quot;adit&quot; is sometimes also used in the context of underground excavation for non-mining purposes; for example, to refer to smaller underground passageways excavated for underground metro systems, to provide pedestrian access to stations (pedestrian adits), and for access required during construction (construction adits). 

==Construction==

Adits are driven into the side of a hill or mountain, and are often used when an ore body is located inside the mountain but above the adjacent valley floor or coastal plain. In cases where the mineral vein outcrops at the surface, the adit may follow the lode or vein until it is worked out, in which case the adit is rarely straight. The use of adits for the extraction of ore is generally called drift mining.

Adits can only be driven into a mine where the local topography permits. There will be no opportunity to drive an adit to a mine situated on a large flat plain, for instance. Also if the ground is weak, the cost of shoring up a long adit may outweigh its possible advantages.

==Access and ventilation==

Access to a mine by adit has many advantages over the vertical access shafts used in shaft mining. Less energy is required to transport miners and heavy equipment into and out of the mine. It is also much easier to bring ore or coal out of the mine. Horizontal travel by means of narrow-gauge tramway or cable car is also much safer and can move more people and ore than vertical elevators. In the past horses and pit ponies were used.

In combination with shafts, adits form an important element in the ventilation of a mine: in simple terms, cool air will enter through an adit, be warmed by the higher temperature underground and will naturally exhaust from vertical shafts, some of which are sunk specifically for this purpose.

==Drainage==

Most adits are designed to slope slightly upwards from the entrance so that water will flow freely out of the mine. Mines that have adits can be at least partly drained of water by gravity alone or power-assisted gravity. The depth to which a mine can be drained by gravity alone is defined by the deepest open adit which is known as the &quot;drainage adit&quot;. The term mine drainage tunnel is also common, at least in the United States. Workings above this level (known as &quot;above adit&quot;) will remain unflooded as long as the adit does not become blocked. All mine workings below both the drainage adit (&quot;below adit&quot;) and the water table will flood unless mechanical means are used for drainage. Until the invention of the steam engine this was the main restriction on deep mining. Adits are useful for deeper mines. Water only needs to be raised to the drainage adit rather than to the surface.

Because of the great reduction in ongoing costs that a drainage adit can provide, they have sometimes been driven for great distances for this purpose. One example is the Milwr tunnel in North Wales, which is about long. Other examples are the Great County Adit in Cornwall, a -long network of adits that used to drain the whole Gwennap mining area, and the Sutro Tunnel at the Comstock Lode in Virginia City, Nevada. A side benefit of driving such extensive adits is that previously unknown ore-bodies can be discovered, helping finance the enormous cost.

Adits were used in Cornwall before 1500, and were important to the tin and copper mines in Cornwall and Devon because the ore-bearing veins are nearly vertical, thus acting as ingress channels for water.

==Notable examples==

*Great County Adit, a system of over of adits used for dewatering more than 100 mines in the Gwennap area of Cornwall in the 18th and early 19th centuries.
*The Hollingwood Common Canal is a disused navigable coal mine adit which terminated at the Chesterfield Canal at Hollingwood, near Staveley, Derbyshire.
*Milwr tunnel, a drainage adit in North Wales. Started in 1897, it still discharges an average of of water per day from the disused Halkyn District United Mines.
* The Snowy Mountains hydroelectric and irrigation scheme in the Australian Snowy Mountains, created during its construction. The adits are very large and used to access the central point from which the hydro tunnels were constructed.
* Black Trout Adit in Tarnowskie Góry, Poland. Part of a former silver mine, the adit was used for removing water from the mine. It still carries water from old galleries to the nearest river. A part of it is open for tourists, who go down the steps in one shaft, have a ride in a boat, and go up the stairs in another shaft.
* Blue Hawk Mine near Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada.
* NORCAT&#x27;s Underground Centre (Fecunis Adit), in Onaping, Ontario, Canada, used for underground training and mining technology development.
* Sutro Tunnel for drainage and exploitation of the Comstock Lode in Nevada.
* Tiefer stollen in Schauinsland near Freiburg.

==Similar terms==

*A &quot;drift&quot; is a more general term for any near-horizontal underground passage in a mine. Unlike an adit, a drift need not break out to the surface. Drift mining is the use of drifts to extract ore - in this case the drifts follow the vein.
* A &quot;level&quot; is a horizontal passage that branches off from a shaft and is used for access to the parts of the mine where the ore is being removed. In mines where the lodes have significant vertical extent there can be many numbered levels, one below the other. They can be connected by short vertical shafts known as &quot;winzes&quot;. A level that reaches the surface, on a hillside or in a valley, for instance, is called an &quot;adit level&quot;. In the Worsley Navigable Levels in Greater Manchester, England, the levels were intentionally flooded and coal was transported on canal boats.
*&quot;Sough&quot; is a term mainly used in the lead mining areas of Derbyshire. The main purpose of a sough is to drain water from the mine.

<text>The Honeymooners is an American television sitcom that originally aired from 1955 to 1956, created by and starring Jackie Gleason, and based on a recurring comedy sketch of the same name that had been part of Gleason&#x27;s variety show. It follows the lives of New York City bus driver Ralph Kramden (Gleason), his wife Alice (Audrey Meadows), Ralph&#x27;s best friend Ed Norton (Art Carney) and Ed&#x27;s wife Trixie (Joyce Randolph) as they get involved with various schemes in their day-to-day living.

Most episodes revolve around Ralph&#x27;s poor choices in absurd dilemmas that frequently show his judgmental attitude in a comedic tone. The show occasionally features more serious issues such as women&#x27;s rights and social status.

The original comedy sketches first aired on the DuMont network&#x27;s variety series &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot;, which Gleason hosted, and subsequently on the CBS network&#x27;s &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, which was broadcast live in front of a theater audience. The popularity of the sketches led Gleason to rework &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; as a filmed half-hour series, which debuted on CBS on October 1, 1955, replacing the variety series. It was initially a ratings success as the No. 2 show in the United States, facing stiff competition from &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; on NBC. Gleason&#x27;s show eventually dropped to No. 19, and production ended after 39 episodes (now referred to as the &quot;Classic 39 episodes&quot;).

The final episode of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; aired on September 22, 1956, and Gleason sporadically revived the characters until 1978. &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was one of the first U.S. television shows to portray working-class married couples in a gritty, non-idyllic manner, as the show is mostly set in the Kramdens&#x27; kitchen in a neglected Brooklyn apartment building. One of the sponsors of the show was Buick.

==Cast and characters==
The majority of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; episodes focus on four principal characters and generally use fixed sets within their Brooklyn apartment building. Although various secondary characters make multiple appearances, and occasional exterior shots are incorporated during editing, virtually all action and dialogue is &quot;on stage&quot; inside the normal backdrop.

===Ralph Kramden===
Played by Jackie Gleason, a bus driver for the fictional Gotham Bus Company based in New York City. He is never seen driving a bus (except in publicity photos), but sometimes is shown at the bus depot. Ralph is frustrated by his lack of success and often develops get-rich-quick schemes. He is short-tempered, frequently resorting to bellowing, insults, and hollow threats. Well-hidden beneath the many layers of bluster, however, is a softhearted man who loves his wife and is devoted to his best friend, Ed Norton. Ralph enjoys bowling and playing pool; he is proficient at both and is an enthusiastic member of the Loyal Order of Raccoons (although in several episodes, a blackboard at the lodge lists his dues as being in arrears). Ralph&#x27;s mother rarely is mentioned, although she appears in one episode. Ralph&#x27;s father is mentioned in only one episode (&quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot;) as having given Ralph a cornet he learned to play as a boy, and Ralph insists on keeping the cornet when Alice suggests it be thrown away.

The Ralph Kramden character was given honorary membership in the real New York City bus drivers&#x27; union (Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union) during the run of the show, and a Brooklyn bus depot was named in Gleason&#x27;s honor after his death. Ralph Kramden was the inspiration for the animated character Fred Flintstone. An eight-foot-tall bronze statue of a jolly Jackie Gleason in a bus driver&#x27;s uniform was erected in 1999 in front of Manhattan&#x27;s midtown Port Authority Bus Terminal. TV Land funded the statue in cooperation with Gleason&#x27;s estate and the Port Authority. Also in 1999, Ralph was ranked #13 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s list of the 50 greatest TV characters.

===Alice Kramden ===
Alice (née Alice Gibson), played in the first nine skits from 1951 to January 1952 by Pert Kelton, by Audrey Meadows until 1966, then by Sheila MacRae, is Ralph&#x27;s patient but sharp-tongued wife of 14 years. She often finds herself bearing the brunt of Ralph&#x27;s tantrums and demands, which she returns with biting sarcasm. She is levelheaded, in contrast to Ralph&#x27;s pattern of inventing various schemes to enhance his wealth or his pride. She sees his schemes&#x27; unworkability, but he becomes angry and ignores her advice (and by the end of the episode, her misgivings almost always prove correct). Upon discovering the failures of his schemes and subsequent cover-ups, she demands to Ralph: &quot;Oh, how I wish you had an explanation for that.&quot; Alice runs the finances of the Kramden household, and Ralph frequently has to beg her for money to pay for his lodge dues or crazy schemes. Alice studied to be a secretary before her marriage and works briefly in that capacity when Ralph is laid off. Wilma Flintstone is based on Alice Kramden.

Another foil for Ralph is Alice&#x27;s mother, who is even sharper-tongued than her daughter and despises Ralph as a bad provider. Alice&#x27;s father is occasionally mentioned, but never seen. Alice&#x27;s sister Agnes appears in episode 22, &quot;Here Comes The Bride&quot;. (Ralph jeopardizes his newlywed sister-in-law&#x27;s marriage after giving some bad advice to the groom, but it all works out in the end). Ralph and Alice lived with her mother for six years after getting married before they got their own apartment. In a 1967 revival, Ralph refers to Alice (played by MacRae in 1966–70 and once more in 1973) as being one of 12 children, and to her father as never working.

&quot;The Honeymooners&quot; originally appeared as a sketch on the DuMont Network&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot;, with the role of Alice played by Pert Kelton (1907–1968). When his contract with DuMont expired, Gleason moved to the CBS network where he had &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, and the role of Alice went to Audrey Meadows because Kelton had been blacklisted. According to playwright Arthur Miller, a family friend, writing many years later in his autobiography &quot;Timebends: A Life&quot;, extensive inquiries finally revealed that her blacklisting was due to the fact that her husband Ralph had, many years earlier, marched in a May Day parade. &quot;Ralph, I knew, had absolutely no leftist connections whatever but had simply thrown himself in with a gang of actors protesting whatever it was that year, and Pert had never even voted in her life.&quot;

The character&#x27;s name is mentioned in the 1998 American stoner comedy film &quot;Half Baked&quot; in the lyrics to the song by the movie&#x27;s character &quot;Sir Smoka-Alot&quot;.

=== Edward Lillywhite/Ethelbert &quot;Ed&quot; Norton===

Played by Art Carney; a New York City municipal sewer worker and Ralph&#x27;s best friend (and upstairs neighbor). He is considerably more good-natured than Ralph, but nonetheless trades insults with him on a regular basis. Ed (typically called &quot;Norton&quot; by Ralph and sometimes by his own wife, Trixie) often gets mixed up in Ralph&#x27;s schemes. His carefree and rather dimwitted nature usually results in raising Ralph&#x27;s ire, while Ralph often showers him with verbal abuse and throws him out of the apartment when Ed irritates him. In most episodes, Ed is shown to be better-read, better-liked, more worldly and more even-tempered than Ralph, despite his unassuming manner and the fact that he usually lets Ralph take the lead in their escapades. Ed and Ralph both are members of the fictional Raccoon Lodge. Like Ralph, Ed enjoys and is good at bowling and playing pool. Unlike Ralph, Ed is good at ping-pong.

Ed worked for the New York City sewer department, and described his job as a &quot;Sub-supervisor in the sub-division of the department of subterranean sanitation, I just keep things moving along.&quot; He served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, and used his G.I. Bill money to pay for typing school, but felt he was unable to work in an office because he hated working in confined spaces. The relatively few scenes set in the Norton apartment showed it to have the same layout as the Kramdens&#x27; but more nicely furnished. Though Norton makes the same weekly $62 salary as Ralph (roughly $ in dollars), their higher standard of living might be explained by Norton&#x27;s freer use of credit; at one point he admits to having 19 charge accounts.

Ed is the inspiration for Barney Rubble in &quot;The Flintstones,&quot; and for Yogi Bear (in terms of design, clothing, and mannerisms). In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked him 2nd on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time&quot;. According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Norton is ranked 8th of the &quot;greatest sidekicks ever&quot;.

===Thelma &quot;Trixie&quot; Norton===
Thelma &quot;Trixie&quot; Norton was Ed&#x27;s wife and Alice&#x27;s best friend. She did not appear in every episode and had a less developed character, though she is shown to be somewhat bossy toward her husband. In one episode, she surprisingly is depicted as a pool hustler. Trixie is the inspiration for Betty Rubble in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;.

Elaine Stritch was the first and original Trixie Norton in a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketch (&quot;The New Television&quot;) with Gleason, Carney, and Pert Kelton. Trixie&#x27;s abrasive ex-burlesque-dancer character was rewritten and recast by Gleason after just one episode, with Joyce Randolph playing the character as a wholesome housewife.

Joyce Randolph played the role in earlier sketches and on the 1955–56 sitcom &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;

Jane Kean played the role in a series of hour-long &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episodes, in color and with music, on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; from 1966 to 1970, playing the role for many more years than her predecessor.

===Others===
Some of the actors who appeared multiple times on the show include George O. Petrie and Frank Marth as various characters, Ethel Owen as Alice&#x27;s mother, Zamah Cunningham as apartment building neighbor Mrs. Manicotti, and Cliff Hall as the Raccoon Lodge president.

Ronnie Burns, son of George Burns and Gracie Allen, made a guest appearance on one episode. On another episode, Norton makes a reference to a co-worker &quot;Nat Birnbaum&quot; (as in &quot;&#x27;nat&#x27;, a three-letter word for bug&quot;, says crossword puzzle aficionado Norton). George Burns&#x27;s real name was Nathan Birnbaum. Seasoned actress Eileen Heckart appeared as Alice&#x27;s mother in the 1978 &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; Christmas special (who was in reality just three years older than her &quot;daughter&quot;, Alice). Strangely, Heckart&#x27;s character makes several comments in the episode alluding to her desire to become a grandmother by Ralph and Alice, this despite the fact that Meadows, who played Alice, was in fact 55 years old at that time.

===The apartment house===
The Kramdens and Nortons lived in an apartment house at 328 Chauncey Street in Brooklyn, New York City, in an area known as &quot;Bushwick&quot; – a nod to the fact that Jackie Gleason lived there after his family moved from his birthplace at 364 Chauncey Street. In the 1955 episode &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Work is Never Done&quot;, the address is referred to as 728 Chauncey Street. The landlord of the apartment house is Mr. Johnson. In &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; episodes taped from 1967 to 1970, the address of the apartment house changed to 358 Chauncey Street, and the number of the Kramden apartment is 3B. The actual 328 Chauncey Street is located in the Stuyvesant Heights section of the borough, approximately eight miles northeast of the show&#x27;s fictional location.

===Apartment residents===
* Mr. and Mrs. Manicotti: An older couple of Italian descent.
* Tyler: Older gentleman who lives on the same floor, who knocks out Ralph’s fighter - “Dynamite” for waking him up while he [Dynamite] works out on the punching / speed bag.
* Tommy Manicotti: He played stickball and contracted the measles. He also left his water pistol in the Kramdens&#x27; apartment.
* Garrity: A vocal upstairs neighbor with whom Ralph frequently feuds. He fought with Ralph for disturbing the neighbors with practicing for &quot;The $99,000 Answer&quot; quiz show. But showing some humor in other episodes, he accused Ralph of renting the tuxedo for his sister-in-law&#x27;s wedding from an undertaker, and loved Ralph&#x27;s joke about &quot;sending a knight out on a dog like this.&quot;
* Garrity Boy: He played stickball and contracted the measles.
* Mrs. Bennett: Needed her radiator fixed when Ralph was the janitor.
* Johnny Bennett: He played stickball, earned an apple for a home-run—and contracted the measles like the other boys.
* Mrs. Doyle: Mother of Tommy Doyle.
* Tommy Doyle: He was arrested for spending a $100 counterfeit bill that Ralph gave him to take his suits to the cleaners.
* Mrs. Stevens: She gave Alice a box for hairpins that was made of matchsticks for Christmas which was the same exact gift Ralph was about to give her but he vastly overpaid for it and thought he had a great gift rather than an insignificant trinket for Alice. Alice gave Mrs. Stevens a kitchen thermometer.
* Mrs. Olsen: She said that Ralph broke her Venetian blinds instead of repairing them when Ralph temporarily was the building janitor.
* Mrs. Hannah: Needed her bathtub fixed when Ralph was the janitor.
* Mrs. Fogerty: Accused Ralph of taking food out of her ice box when Ralph was the janitor.
* Mrs. Schwartz: The apartment house blabbermouth who reported that the Kramdens had set the all-time lowest gas bill for the building. She also was curious to know if the house phone was able to connect to New Jersey when Ralph was the janitor.
* Mr. Riley: Had a full garbage can that needed to be emptied when Ralph was the janitor.

* Tommy Mullins: A U.S. Navy service member who was home on leave for Christmas.
* Carlos Sanchez: A mambo dancer who works at night.
* Mr. and Mrs. August Gunther: Former residents of the building. August hit it big with his doughnut business.
* Mr. Johnson: The building&#x27;s landlord.

==Plot==
Most of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; takes place in Ralph and Alice Kramden&#x27;s small, sparsely furnished two-room apartment. Other settings used in the show included the Gotham Bus Company depot, the Raccoon Lodge, a neighborhood pool parlor, a park bench where Ralph and Ed occasionally meet for lunch, and on occasion the Nortons&#x27; apartment (always noticeably better-furnished than the Kramdens&#x27;). Many episodes begin with a shot of Alice in the apartment awaiting Ralph&#x27;s arrival from work. Most episodes focus on Ralph&#x27;s and Ed&#x27;s characters, although Alice played a substantial role. Trixie played a smaller role in the series, and did not appear in every episode as did the other three. Each episode presented a self-contained story, which rarely carried over into a subsequent one. The show employed a number of standard sitcom clichés and plots, particularly those of jealousy, get-rich-quick schemes, and comic misunderstanding.

As to the occasional plot continuations, there were two such one concerning Ralph being sent to a psychiatrist because of &quot;impatient&quot; behavior during work that resulted in several passengers lodging complaints about his professional demeanor, and one that continued for two sequential shows in which Aunt Ethel visited and Ralph hatched a scheme to marry her off to the neighborhood butcher.

The series presents Ralph as an everyman and an underdog who struggles to make a better life for himself and his wife, but who ultimately fails due to his own shortcomings. He, often along with Ed, devises a number of get-rich-quick schemes, none of which succeed. Ralph would be quick to blame others for his misfortune until it was pointed out to him where he had fallen short. Ralph&#x27;s anger then would be replaced by short-lived remorse, and he would apologize for his actions. Many of these apologies to Alice ended with Ralph saying in a heartfelt manner, &quot;Baby, you&#x27;re the greatest,&quot; followed by a hug and kiss.

In most episodes, Ralph&#x27;s short temper got the best of him, leading him to yell at others and to threaten comical physical violence, usually against Alice. Ralph&#x27;s favorite threats to her were &quot;One of these days ... One of these days ... Pow! right in the kisser!&quot; or to knock her &quot;to the Moon, Alice!&quot; (Sometimes this last threat was simply abbreviated: as &quot;Bang, zoom!&quot;) On other occasions, Ralph simply told Alice, &quot;Oh, are you gonna get yours.&quot; All of this led to criticism, more than 40 years later, that the show displayed an ironic acceptance of domestic violence. But Ralph never carried out his threats, and others have pointed out that Alice knew he never would because of their deep love for each indeed, Alice never was seen to back down during any of Ralph&#x27;s tirades. In retaliation, the targets of Ralph&#x27;s verbal abuse often responded by simply joking about his weight, a common theme throughout the series.

For the &quot;Classic 39&quot; episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, there was no continuing story arc. Each episode is self-contained. For example, in the series premiere episode &quot;TV or Not TV&quot;, Ralph and Norton buy a television set with the intent to share it. By the next week&#x27;s show, the set is gone although in later episodes a set is shown in the Nortons&#x27; apartment. In the installment &quot;The Baby Sitter&quot;, the Kramdens get a telephone, but in the next episode, it is gone. And, in the episode, &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Life&quot;, Alice gets a dog from the pound which Ralph tries to return. But, in the end, Ralph finds himself growing to love the dog and decides to keep it along with a few other dogs. However, in the next episode, the dogs are nowhere to be seen and are never referred to again.

Occasionally, references to earlier episodes were made, including to Ralph&#x27;s various &quot;crazy harebrained schemes&quot; from the lost episodes. Norton&#x27;s sleepwalking in &quot;The Sleepwalker&quot; was referenced in &quot;Oh My Aching Back&quot;, but it was not until the 1967 &quot;Trip To Europe&quot; shows that a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; story arc is finally used.

==History==
===Origins===
In July 1950, Jackie Gleason became the host of &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot;, a variety show that aired on the struggling DuMont Television Network. After the first year, he and his writers Harry Crane and Joe Bigelow developed a sketch that drew upon familiar domestic situations for its material. Based on the popular radio show &quot;The Bickersons&quot;, Gleason wanted a realistic portrayal of life for a poor husband and wife living in Brooklyn, his home borough. The couple would continually argue but ultimately show their love for each other. After rejecting titles such as &quot;The Beast&quot;, &quot;The Lovers&quot; and &quot;The Couple Next Door&quot;, Gleason and his staff settled on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. Gleason took the role of Ralph Kramden, a blustery bus driver, and he chose veteran comedy film actress Pert Kelton for the role of Alice Kramden, Ralph&#x27;s acerbic and long-suffering wife.

&quot;The Honeymooners&quot; debuted on October 5, 1951, as a six-minute sketch. Ensemble cast member Art Carney made a brief appearance as a police officer who is hit with flour that Ralph throws from the window. The tone of these early sketches was much darker than that of the later series, with Ralph exhibiting great bitterness and frustration with his marriage to an equally bitter and argumentative middle-aged woman (Kelton was nine years older than was Gleason). The Kramdens&#x27; financial struggles mirrored those of Gleason&#x27;s early life in Brooklyn, and he took great pains to model the set on his memory of the apartment where he had lived. The Kramdens—and later the Nortons when those characters were added—are childless, an issue only occasionally explored, but a condition upon which Gleason insisted. Ralph and Alice did legally adopt a baby girl whom they named Ralphina. However, the biological mother requested to have her baby returned. A few later sketches had Ralph mistakenly believe that Alice was pregnant.

Early cast additions in later sketches were upstairs neighbors Ed and Trixie Norton. Ed was a sewer worker and Ralph&#x27;s best friend, although his innocent and guileless nature was the source of many arguments between the two men. Trixie (maiden name never mentioned), Ed&#x27;s wife, was originally portrayed by Elaine Stritch as a burlesque dancer, but was replaced after just one appearance by the more wholesome-looking Joyce Randolph. Trixie is a foil to Ed, just as Alice is to Ralph, but often offscreen.

With the colorful array of characters whom Gleason had invented, including the cast of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; sketches, &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; became a great success for DuMont and increased its audience share from 9% to 25%. Gleason&#x27;s contract with DuMont expired in the summer of 1952, and the financially struggling network (which suffered through ten rounds of layoffs from July through October 1953) was unable to retain him, and he moved to CBS.

===Move to CBS===
In July 1952, CBS president William S. Paley sent Gleason and his cast on a highly successful nationwide five-week promotional tour, performing musical numbers and sketches (including the popular &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;). However, Kelton, who played Alice Kramden and other roles, was blacklisted and replaced on the tour by &quot;Beulah&quot; actress Ginger Jones, who also became blacklisted (having earlier been named on the &quot;Red Channels&quot; blacklist) by CBS. As a result, yet another Alice was needed.

Jones&#x27;s replacement was Audrey Meadows, known for her work in the 1951 Broadway musical &quot;Top Banana&quot; and on the &quot;Bob &amp; Ray&quot; television show. However, Gleason was concerned that Meadows was too attractive to make a credible Alice. To convince him, Meadows hired a photographer to take pictures of her in the early morning with no makeup, clad in a torn housecoat and with her hair undone. When Gleason saw the photos, he said, &quot;That&#x27;s our Alice.&quot; When he learned that it was Meadows in the photos, he reportedly said, &quot;Any dame who has a sense of humor like that deserves the job.&quot; The lineup of Gleason, Carney, Meadows and Randolph was now in place.

The increasingly popular &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; sketches were prominent in episodes of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; variety show. During the first season, they appeared on a regular basis (although not weekly) as a series of short sketches ranging in length from seven to thirteen minutes. For the 1953–54 season, the shorter sketches were outnumbered by ones that ran for 30 minutes or longer. During the 1954–55 season, most episodes of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; consisted entirely of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. Fan response became overwhelming, and Meadows received hundreds of curtains and aprons in the mail from fans who wanted to help Alice lead a fancier life. By January 1955, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; was competing with—and sometimes beating—&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as the most-watched television show in the United States. Audience members would queue around the block hours in advance in order to attend the show.

===The &quot;Classic 39&quot; episodes===
The &quot;Classic 39&quot; episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; are those that originally aired as a weekly half-hour sitcom on CBS from October 1955 to September 1956.

Before Gleason&#x27;s initial three-year contract with CBS expired, he was offered a much larger contract by CBS and General Motors&#x27; Buick division. The three-year contract, reportedly valued at $11million (about $million now), was one of the largest in showbusiness history at the time. It called for Gleason to produce 78 filmed episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; over two seasons, with an option for a third season of 39 more. He was scheduled to receive $65,000 for each episode ($ now) and $70,000 per episode in the second season ($ now), but he had to pay all production costs out of that amount. Art Carney received $3,500 per week ($ now), Audrey Meadows $2,000 ($ now), and Joyce Randolph (who did not appear in every episode) $500 per week ($ now). Production was handled by Jackie Gleason Enterprises Inc., which also produced &quot;Stage Show&quot;, a program that aired directly before episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; and starred the Dorsey Brothers. Meadows, who later became a banker, was reportedly the only cast member to receive residuals when the &quot;Classic 39&quot; episodes were rebroadcast in syndication because her brother Edward, a lawyer, had inserted language to that effect into her contract. Randolph received royalty payments when the &quot;lost&quot; &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episodes from the variety shows were released.

The first episode of the new half-hour series aired on Saturday, October 1, 1955, at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time opposite &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; on ABC and &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; on NBC. Because the show was sponsored by Buick, the opening credits originally ended with a sponsor identification by announcer Jack Lescoulie (&quot;Brought to you by your Buick dealer. And away we go!&quot;), and the show concluded with a brief Gleason sales pitch for the company, all common practices at the time. All references to Buick were removed when the show entered syndication in 1957, although Gleason frequently said &quot;And away we go!&quot; frequently in various shows, and the quote is inscribed on his gravestone.

The initial critical reaction to the half-hour sitcom &quot;Honeymooners&quot; was mixed. &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Telecasting Magazine&quot; wrote that it was &quot;labored&quot; and lacked the spontaneity of the live sketches. But &quot;TV Guide&quot; praised it as &quot;rollicking&quot;, &quot;slapsticky&quot; and &quot;fast-paced&quot;. In February 1956, the show was moved to the 8:00 p.m. ET timeslot, but it already had begun losing viewers to the hugely popular &quot;Perry Como Show&quot;. Gleason&#x27;s writers also had begun to feel confined by the restrictive half-hour format—in previous seasons, &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; sketches typically ran 35 minutes or more—and Gleason felt that were beginning to exhaust original ideas. After just one season, Gleason and CBS agreed to cancel &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, which aired its 39th and final original episode on September22, 1956. In explaining his decision to end the show with $7million remaining on his contract, Gleason said, &quot;The excellence of the material could not be maintained, and I had too much fondness for the show to cheapen it.&quot; Gleason subsequently sold the films of the &quot;Classic 39&quot; episodes of the show to CBS for $1.5million.

==Production==
In 1955, many television shows (including &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;) were performed live and recorded using kinescope technology, although many sitcoms were recorded on film, such as &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, &quot;My Little Margie&quot; and &quot;I Married Joan&quot;. &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, which was recorded directly onto 35mm film, had influenced television production companies to produce directly on film. For &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, Gleason utilized the Electronicam TV film system, developed by DuMont in the early 1950s, which allowed for a live performance to be directly captured on film. As a result of the superior picture and sound quality afforded by the system, episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; were much more suitable for rebroadcast than were most other live shows of the era.

All 39 episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; were filmed at the DuMont Television Network&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre at 152 West 54th Street in Manhattan before an audience of 1,000. Episodes were never fully rehearsed because Gleason felt that rehearsals would rob the show of its spontaneity. As a result, mistakes often were made, with lines recited incorrectly or altogether forgotten, and actors did not always follow the scripted action directions. To compensate, the cast developed visual cues for each other. For example, Gleason patted his stomach when he forgot a line, while Meadows would glance at the icebox when someone else was supposed to retrieve something from it.

In contrast to other popular comedies of the era (such as &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;), which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle-class suburban environments, Richard Rychtarik&#x27;s set design for &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; reflected the blue-collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, sparsely furnished two-room apartment in a tenement building at least four stories high (the Kramdens lived on the third floor and the Nortons lived one floor above them). They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining and living room. It consisted of a table and chairs, a chest of drawers, a curtainless window with a painted backdrop view of a fire escape and adjoining tenements, a noisy sink and an outdated icebox. The Kramdens&#x27; bedroom never was seen. One of the few other sitcoms about a blue-collar family was &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;, a show that featured Gleason in its first season (1949–50).

The instrumental theme song for &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, titled &quot;You&#x27;re My Greatest Love&quot;, was composed by Gleason and performed by an orchestra led by Ray Bloch, previously the orchestra leader for Gleason&#x27;s variety show as well as for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Although lyrics were composed, they were never sung. Sammy Spear, who later became Gleason&#x27;s musical director, provided the arrangement. The music heard in the episodes was not performed during the show, so to enhance the feeling of a live performance for the studio audience, an orchestra performed before filming and during breaks. The show&#x27;s original announcer was Jack Lescoulie, who also was a spokesman for the sponsor, Buick. For the unsponsored syndicated version, the introduction was voiced by CBS staff announcer Gaylord Avery.

==Revivals==
On September 29, 1956, one week after &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; ended as a weekly 30-minute series, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; returned. &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; returned as part of the revived variety show. Eight episodes were produced as original full hour &quot;Honeymooners&quot; musicals with music and lyrics by Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bresler. The stories featured the Kramdens and Nortons touring Europe after winning a contest. Live musicals had become popular on live television following the success of the 1954-1955 live broadcasts of Mary Martin in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; as well as that of several Max Leibman original musicals. Including the musical episodes, a total of 20 skits of various lengths were performed that season, including restaging of several older skits. (One episode, featuring a remake of &quot;Six Months of Live&quot; is still missing.)

In 1959, &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine mentioned Gleason&#x27;s interest in producing new &quot;Honeymooners&quot; shows. This did not happen for several years, but Gleason did team with Carney to revive an old &quot;Honeymooners&quot; scene for an October 1960 CBS special titled &quot;The Big Sell&quot;.

After the spectacular failure of Gleason&#x27;s 1961 game show &quot;You&#x27;re in the Picture&quot; and the relative success of the eight-episode talk show that Gleason used to fill its time slot, his variety show returned in 1962 under the title &quot;Jackie Gleason and His American Scene Magazine&quot;. The &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches returned as part of the show whenever Carney was available. However, Meadows and Randolph were replaced by Sue Ane Langdon and Patricia Wilson for two sketches.

In January 1966, Meadows returned on Gleason&#x27;s &quot;American Scene Magazine&quot; variety series as Alice for &quot;The Honeymooners: The Adoption&quot;, a reenactment of a 1955 non-musical sketch of the same name, with original songs added by Duddy and Bresler.

When &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, by then based at Gleason&#x27;s relocated headquarters in Miami Beach, Florida, returned in 1966, the &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches, in color for the first time, featured Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean in the roles of Alice and Trixie, as Meadows and Randolph declined to relocate to Miami. Gleason did not object to recasting the roles of the wives but was adamant that the Ed Norton role should never be played by anyone other than Carney.

The 1966 videotaped &quot;Honeymooners&quot; were also musical episodes that comprised 18 of the first season&#x27;s 32 shows. Most of these were updated remakes of 1956-57 musical episodes with songs by Duddy and Bresler, expanded with new material. This include an addition episode added to the &quot;Trip To Europe&quot; sketches. Ten of these programs were syndicated for local stations as &quot;The Honeymooners Go to Europe&quot; and the 1966-1970 color hour shows were released on DVD as &quot;The Color Honeymooners&quot;.

One notable 1967 segment featured the return of Pert Kelton (in one of her last performances before her death in 1968), but as Alice&#x27;s mother.

&quot;The Honeymooners&quot; ended again when CBS announced the cancellation of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; on February 16, 1970, the result of a disagreement in direction between Gleason and the network. Gleason wanted to continue interspersing &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; within his regular variety show, while CBS wanted a full-hour &quot;Honeymooners&quot; every week. CBS&#x27;s ongoing effort to move its product toward younger audiences and away from established variety show stars was another potential factor in the show&#x27;s demise. On October 11, 1973, Gleason, Carney, MacRae and Kean reunited for a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketch titled &quot;Women&#x27;s Lib&quot; as part of a Gleason special on CBS. Four final one-hour specials aired on ABC from 1976 to 1978, with Meadows returning as Alice and Kean as Trixie. These specials came at a time when Gleason and Carney were each achieving newfound expanded fame, with Gleason&#x27;s prominent role in the box office smash &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; and Carney winning an Academy Award for his leading role in &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot;. These were the final original &quot;Honeymooners&quot; productions.

In May 2022, MPI released &quot;Jackie Gleason TV Treasures&quot;, which includes three previously unreleased &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches from the early 1960s, the 1966 musical remake of &quot;The Honeymooners: The Adoption&quot; episode and seven color &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketch episodes not included in previous collections.

==Awards==
Carney won five Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Ed Norton—two for the original &quot;Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, one for &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; and two for the final version of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. He was nominated for another two in 1957 and 1966, but lost. Gleason and Meadows both were nominated in 1956 for their work on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. Gleason was nominated for Best Actor–Continuing Performance but lost to Phil Silvers, while Meadows was nominated for Best Actress-Supporting Role but lost to Nanette Fabray. Meadows also was nominated for Emmys for her portrayal of Alice Kramden in 1954 and 1957.

The following table summarizes award wins by cast members, both for &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;.

==Broadcast history==
==Episodes==

==Syndication and home media releases==
&quot;The Honeymooners&quot; gained its greatest fame in syndication, where it has aired continually since its original cancellation. WPIX in New York City has aired the series for more than five decades (after it had initially run in 1957–1958 on WRCA-TV), with occasional brief breaks. It regularly airs on WPIX with a marathon that begins on the final hour of New Year&#x27;s Eve and runs well into New Year&#x27;s Day. In the United Kingdom, it originally aired on ITV between 1958–1963. BBC Two aired 38 of the original 39 episodes beginning in 1989 and ending in 1991. The show also has aired in Australia, Iran, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Ireland and Suriname. It previously was seen on WGN America from June 2008 to September 2009 and on Me-TV from December 2010 to September 2011. In April 2012, the show returned to Me-TV. The show currently airs on the network on Sunday nights. Reruns of the show also air on Catchy Comedy.

In 1984, the Museum of Television and Radio announced the discovery of four original &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches from &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, and response was overwhelmingly positive. In January 1985, Gleason announced the release of an additional group of &quot;lost&quot; episodes from his private vault. As with the previously released sketches, these &quot;lost episodes&quot; were actually kinescopes from the 1952–55 and 1956–57 runs of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. Because the prints had not been stored under ideal conditions, parts of the soundtracks of three episodes were unusable, and the voices had to be redubbed. Gleason personally approved the soundalike actors, with noted voice actor Joe Alaskey providing Ralph Kramden&#x27;s lines.

Gleason sold the broadcast rights to the &quot;lost&quot; episodes to Viacom, and they first were aired from 1985 to 1986 as a series of 68 22-minute episodes on the Showtime cable network. They since have joined the original 39 episodes in syndication and also have been released on VHS and DVD. In September 2004, another &quot;lost&quot; episode was discovered at the Peabody Award archives in Georgia. The episode, titled &quot;Love Letter&quot;, originally aired on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; on October 16, 1954. It aired for the first time since then on October 16, 2004, its 50th anniversary, on TVLand. Viacom successor CBS Media Ventures, via CBS Broadcasting, owns the &quot;Classic 39&quot; series outright, while the Gleason estate owns the &quot;lost episodes&quot;.

Paramount Home Entertainment/CBS DVD released a six-disc DVD box set titled &quot;The Honeymooners &quot;Classic 39&quot; Episodes&quot; in November 2003 (only available in Region 1). The set contains all 39 episodes from the series&#x27; original 1955–56 broadcast run. Also included in the set is an edited version of a 1990 anniversary special hosted by Meadows as well as original show openings and closings sponsored by Buick that were removed when the show entered syndication.

MPI Home Video released 80 of the &quot;lost episodes&quot; in Region 1 DVD format in 2001–02 on 24 single-disc volumes. MPI subsequently re-packaged the 24 volumes into six four-disc box sets. Production of the 24 individual volumes and the six four-disc box sets ceased in 2008, but MPI has since renewed its deal with Jackie Gleason Enterprises and has continued to release new editions of the &quot;lost&quot; episodes and other &quot;Honeymooners&quot; material not currently owned by CBS. In 2011, MPI announced the release of a completely restored set of all existing &quot;Honeymooners Lost Episodes&quot; from 1951 to 1957. The 50-hour, 15-DVD set contains 107 &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches and the home-video debut of the nine existing original DuMont Network sketches, six other sketches never before released on home video and the eight musical &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episodes from 1957 (the &quot;Trip To Europe&quot; shows). The set was released on October 4, 2011.

In June 2006, MPI released &quot;The Color Honeymooners – Collection 1&quot; (NTSC and PAL), which collects the &quot;Trip to Europe&quot; story arc presented on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; in 1966. It has since released an additional three volumes featuring additional episodes from this story arc. AmericanLife TV Network has also aired &quot;The Color Honeymooners&quot; shows under license from Gleason Enterprises and Paul Brownstein Productions.

In May 2022, MPI released &quot;Jackie Gleason TV Treasures&quot;, which includes three previously unreleased &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches from the early 1960s, the 1966 musical remake of &quot;The Honeymooners: The Adoption&quot; episode and seven color &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketch episodes not included in previous collections.

Paramount and CBS Home Entertainment released the 39 episodes on Blu-ray disc in March 2014.

In Australia (Region 4), Shock Entertainment released &quot;The Honeymooners - Classic 39 Episodes&quot; five-disc set in NTSC format on November 13, 2009, rereleased on August 5, 2020.

==Impact==
* In 1997, the episodes &quot;The $99,000 Answer&quot; and &quot;TV or Not TV&quot; were respectively ranked No. 6 and No. 26 on &quot;&quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot;.

==Legacy==
Because of its enduring popularity, &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; has been referenced numerous times in American pop culture, and has served as the inspiration for other television shows, most notably &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. The show also introduced memorable catchphrases into American culture such as &quot;Bang, zoom, straight to the Moon!&quot;, &quot;One of these days... one of these days...,&quot; &quot;Homina, homina, homina,&quot; and &quot;Baby, you&#x27;re the greatest.&quot;

===&quot;The Flintstones&quot;===
In 1960, the Hanna-Barbera-produced animated sitcom &quot;The Flintstones&quot; debuted on ABC. Many critics and viewers noted the close resemblance of the show&#x27;s premise and characters to those of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, and William Hanna and Joseph Barbera have both stated that &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was among their inspirations for &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Gleason later said that he considered suing but decided that becoming known as &quot;the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air&quot; was not worth the negative publicity. &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; had been compared in its day to the similar comedy series &quot;The Bickersons&quot; as well as to the work of Laurel and Hardy (particularly &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot;). &quot;The Flintstones&quot; series and its spinoffs changed over the years and deviated from the similarities to &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;.

===Spoofs, parodies and importation===

* In the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;The Series Has Landed&quot;, Ralph Kramden is believed to have been an early astronaut, due to his catchphrase (which Fry protests was &quot;a metaphor for beating his wife&quot;.)
* In the episode &quot;Spanish Fry&quot; of the same show, Lrrr says, &quot;One of these days, Ndnd, bang! zoom! straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!!&quot;
* The &quot;Moonlighting&quot; episode &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; contains a lengthy parody of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; as &quot;The Bluemooners&quot;, with Bruce Willis as Ralph, Charles Rocket as Norton, Allyce Beasley as Trixie, and Cybill Shepherd as Alice.
* The sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot; was partially inspired by &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;.&quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, among other shows, was parodied directly in a dream sequence in the episode &quot;Inner Tube&quot;.
* Robert McKimson would pay homage the show with a series of animated &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts, in which the principal characters, Ralph and Alice Crumden and Ned and Trixie Morton, are depicted as mice and Ralph&#x27;s &quot;big dream&quot; is to get enough cheese to impress Alice. These cartoons are &quot;The Honey-Mousers&quot; (1956), &quot;Cheese It, the Cat!&quot; (1957), and &quot;Mice Follies&quot; (1960). McKimson would also direct the 1956 Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Half-Fare Hare&quot;, in which Bugs is pitted against caricatures of Ralph and Ed as train-riding hoboes.
** Friz Freleng would also reference the Honeymooners in the Sylvester and Tweety short &quot;Red Riding Hoodwinked&quot; (1955) also features the usually-cheerful Granny character taking on the role of blustery, female Ralph. In another Sylvester and Tweety cartoon, &quot;A Bird in a Bonnet&quot; (1958), when Sylvester falls into an open manhole, inside a voice like Ed Norton&#x27;s says, &quot;Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hey, look at this, Ralph, a pussycat.&quot; To which Sylvester simply peers out of the sewer to the audience.
* The writer/comic Louis C.K. stated in an interview that he based the layout of Louie&#x27;s apartment in the HBO show &quot;Lucky Louie&quot; on the Kramdens&#x27; apartment, in contrast to other shows such as &quot;The King of Queens&quot; that have very nicely decorated apartments despite the characters&#x27; professed low incomes.
* Stan Freberg created a brief audio skit titled &quot;The Honeyearthers&quot;, in which Ralph, Alice, Norton, and Trixie are aliens living on the moon. In keeping with the 1950s ideas of what aliens would look like, they have two heads, one eye, one ear, four hands, three feet and antennae. Ralph drives a rocket ship and Norton works in a &quot;green cheese mine&quot;. At the end of the skit, Ralph offers to take Alice on a &quot;honeyearth&quot; to renew their marriage.
*In &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985) George McFly (Crispin Glover) and his older son Dave (Marc McClure) are seen cracking up in nerdy fashion while watching the episode &quot;The Man from Space&quot;. After his younger son Marty (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time to November 5, 1955, he watches the same episode at the home of his then-teenaged mother Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson), where her father (George DiCenzo) wheels their newly acquired television set in front of the family table, saying giddily: &quot;Now we can watch Jackie Gleason while we eat!&quot; – a reference to the TV series. In real life though, November 5, 1955 was the day &quot;The Sleepwalker&quot; aired, while &quot;The Man from Space&quot; aired on December 31.
* In the &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; season 3 episode &quot;High High&quot; (where the Jump Street team is assigned to go undercover at a performing arts school), Doug Penhall cites &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; as one of his favorite shows growing up. Towards the end, he reenacts a scene from the episode &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; for acting class.
* &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was spoofed in an episode of &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; as a result of the character Balki Bartoukomos (Bronson Pinchot)&#x27;s spinning an extended metaphor about the characters&#x27; existential situation to an episode of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; he had once seen; Balki&#x27;s description of the episode is shown in a black-and-white flashback.
* As Ralph Kramden was a New York City bus driver, one of the service depots in Brooklyn was renamed the Jackie Gleason Bus Depot in 1988. All buses that originate from the bus depot bear a sticker on the front that has a logo derived from the &quot;face on the Moon&quot; opening credits of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. The MTA also took 1948 GM-TDH5101 bus number 4789, renumbered it to 2969 and made it the &#x27;official Jackie Gleason bus&#x27;.
* A statue of Gleason as Ralph Kramden stands at the Eighth Avenue entrance to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City. The plaque on the base of the statue reads, &quot;Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden — Bus Driver — Raccoon Lodge Treasurer — Dreamer — Presented by the People of TV Land&quot;
* An episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Ten-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, includes a fictional rip-off of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; called &quot;The Adventures of Fatso Flannigan&quot;.
* In 2011, an adult parody titled &quot;The Honeymoaners&quot; was released by DreamZone Entertainment, with Peter O&#x27;Tole as Ralph and Anthony Rosano as Ed. Both actors also played Fred and Barney in &quot;The Flintstones – A XXX Parody&quot;, an adult parody of the Flintstones, which have a resemblance to the show (as mentioned above). The plot of the parody is similar to the episode &quot;The $99,000 Answer&quot;, only here the show is called &quot;The $69,000 Answer&quot; and Ralph is answering questions about sex.
* &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was spoofed in episode 22 of the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (then known as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&quot;) in a sketch featuring The Killer Bees (referenced as &#x27;The Bees&#x27; in this particular episode). John Belushi took the role of Ralph, with Gilda Radner as Alice, Dan Aykroyd as Norton, and Jane Curtin as Trixie.
* The first adult film parody of the show, &quot;Honeymooners&quot;, premiered in 1976 and starred John Leslie as the Ralph Kramden character.
*The Toronto Coach Terminal included a restaurant and bar named Kramden&#x27;s Kafe from 1990 until 2013.
* &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was partly the inspiration for the Nickelodeon series &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;.
* In 1988 Ron Jeremy led a cast of adult performers in the critically panned &quot;The Horneymooners&quot;.
* Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Family Guy&quot; has parodied it on numerous occasions.

===Adaptations and remakes===
The success of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; in countries outside the United States has led to the production of new shows based entirely on it.

====International remakes====
==========
Two series, 26 episodes in all were made for R.C.T.I. in 1996. It was the first sitcom of that style ever attempted in Indonesia. It was titled &quot;Detak Detik&quot; (&quot;Ticking Seconds&quot;) and starred Mat Sola as the Jackie Gleason character. Art Carney rang the cast prior to production to give them his best wishes. It was decided to make Mat Sola a Silver Bird taxi driver, as they had a bit more prestige in Indonesia. They left Nurbuat, who mirrored Ed Norton, as a sewerage worker. The chemistry worked well. The series had to remove any references to alcohol, as Indonesia is a country with a Muslim majority population.
French Canada was entertained for years in the 1960s and &#x27;70s by a sitcom titled &quot;Cré Basile&quot;, with Olivier Guimond, Béatrice Picard, Denis Drouin and Amulette Garneau, which was an uncredited Quebecois version of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. It could, by contemporary standards, qualify as plagiarism.
In 1994, the Dutch broadcasting network KRO produced a version of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; titled &quot;Toen Was Geluk Heel Gewoon&quot; (&quot;Back then happiness was common&quot;), using translated scripts of the original series but changing its setting to 1950s Rotterdam. After the original 39 scripts were exhausted, the series&#x27; lead actors, Gerard Cox and Sjoerd Pleijsier, took over writing, adding many new characters and references to Dutch history and popular culture. The series was a hit in the Netherlands and it finished its run after 16 years and 229 episodes in June 2009. The actors reprised their characters five years later in a feature-length movie.
In 1994, the Swedish network TV4 produced a version of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; titled &quot;Rena Rama Rolf&quot;, but changing its setting to contemporary Gothenburg, where Rolf (Ralph), played by Lasse Brandeby, is working as a streetcar driver. The show ran until 1998.
In 1998, the Polish network Polsat produced a version of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; titled &quot;Miodowe lata&quot; which translates to &quot;Honey years&quot; (because in Polish a honeymoon is translated as a &quot;honey month&quot;), using both translated scripts of the original series and new ones, but changing its setting to modern-day Warsaw. The original series ran until 2003 and was continued in 2004 as &quot;Całkiem nowe lata miodowe&quot;.

====Comics====
Vince Musacchia created a comic book series based on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; for Hypergraphics between 1987 and 1989.

====Film====
On June 10, 2005, a feature film remake of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was released, featuring a predominantly African American cast. The roles of Ralph, Alice, Ed, and Trixie were played by Cedric the Entertainer, Gabrielle Union, Mike Epps, and Regina Hall, respectively. The movie was a critical and commercial failure, earning slightly more than US$13 million worldwide. The film was released by Paramount Pictures.

====Video game====
In 1988, First Row Software released a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; computer game for the Commodore 64 and DOS systems. The game involves the Kramdens and Nortons trying to earn $223 for train fare to Miami Beach, where Ralph wants to host the annual Raccoon Lodge convention, by playing a variety of mini-games related to the series. Additionally, players have the option of trying to double their money after each round by answering a &quot;Honeymooners&quot;-related question in a bonus round based on &quot;The $99,000 Answer&quot; episode.

====Reboots====
In December 2016, a CBS reboot of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; with Bob Kushell writing and executive producing the series was announced but it never came to fruition. Producers Sarah Timberman, Carl Beverly, Eric &amp; Kim Tannenbaum, and Jeff Greenstein were also announced as part of the development deal.

In January 2022, a CBS reboot of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; with Damon Wayans Jr. executive producing the series was announced.

====Musical====
In September 2017, Paper Mill Playhouse produced the world-premiere of a musical adaptation of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, starring Michael McGrath as Ralph, Michael Mastro as Ed, Leslie Kritzer as Alice, and Laura Bell Bundy as Trixie. The musical had a book by Dusty Kay and Bill Nuss, with music by Stephen Weiner and lyrics by Peter Mills. It was directed by John Rando and choreographed by Joshua Bergasse.

<text>Whipplea is a monotypic genus containing the single species Whipplea modesta, which is known by several common names including common whipplea, yerba de selva, and modesty. It is a dicot shrub or sub-shrub in the Hydrangeaceae family, native to the Pacific Coastal region of the United States.

&quot;Whipplea&quot; appears to have been first recorded in 1853 by the Scottish botanical explorer John Jeffrey in the Umpqua Valley near Mount Shasta, California, and named for Lieutenant Amiel Weeks Whipple (1817–1863), American surveyor and engineer.

<text>The College of Creative Studies (CCS) is the smallest of the three undergraduate colleges at the University of California, Santa Barbara, unique within the University of California system in terms of structure and philosophy. Its small size, student privileges, and grading system are designed to encourage self-motivated students with strong interests in a field to accomplish original work as undergraduates. A former student has called it a “graduate school for undergraduates”. The college has roughly 350 students in nine majors and approximately 60 professors and lecturers. There is an additional application process to the standard UC Santa Barbara admission for prospective CCS students, and CCS accepts applications for admissions throughout the year.

The college only offers 9 majors: Art, Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Computing, Marine Science, Mathematics, Music Composition, Physics, and Writing and Literature.

== History ==
In the late 1960s, the Chancellor of UC Santa Barbara, Vernon I. Cheadle, was looking for an alternative education program for undergraduate students which could embody the new thinking of the 60s and also attract attention to his growing university. He contacted a professor in the English department, Marvin Mudrick, to come up with ideas for this new program. In 1967 the University of California allowed funding for Mudrick to start up the most promising of those ideas, the College of Creative Studies.

The program started with approximately 50 students in 7 majors: Art, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Music Composition, Literature, and Physics. The experimental program struck a chord with its students and faculty, and along with the powerful pushing of Mudrick as its provost, it secured its place at UC Santa Barbara. The program grew over the years in student and faculty size and in 1975 found its home in a building at UC Santa Barbara that dates from when the campus was a World War II marine base. In 1995, the college added the major of Computer Science. In 2005, with the retirement of Provost William Ashby, the title of the Provost was changed to Dean and the College was placed under the leadership of Dr. Bruce Tiffney. In fall 2020, the college added the Marine Science major. 

The Art department includes the only undergraduate book arts program in the University of California system. Recently, the Physics program has become regarded as one of the best undergraduate Physics programs in the nation; its students attend graduate schools with percentages resembling those of Ivy Leagues. CCS students have won the UC Santa Barbara Chancellor&#x27;s Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research several times in recent years. Literature students run &quot;Spectrum&quot;, a literary magazine, and &quot;Into the Teeth of the Wind&quot;, a poetry review.

== Philosophy ==

The philosophy of the College of Creative Studies is that certain undergraduate students are capable of rigorously exploring and adding to their chosen field of knowledge. Students skip introductory courses as appropriate and are encouraged to accomplish original work throughout their time at the College: Writing &amp; Literature students compile a portfolio of writing, art students put on a minimum of two shows displaying their work, music students perform their own compositions, and science students enter labs early in their undergraduate career to conduct research and write scholarly papers for publication.

The College considers students to be the most important people involved, not the faculty or administration. It has a low student-teacher ratio, and each student is paired with a faculty adviser with whom they meet at least once a quarter.

== Privileges and grading system ==

CCS students have few general education requirements and may take almost any course in the entire university, including graduate classes, provided they have permission from the instructor. They can drop classes up to the last day of instruction in the quarter, a privilege intended to encourage students to attempt taking many units and advanced classes without being penalized, in the event that they are unable to fulfill these commitments.

In CCS classes, students do not receive letter grades. Instead, the College uses a sliding unit scale where if a student completes all the work for a class at a satisfactory level, the student receives a full 4 units for most classes. If the student completes less work, he/she would receive fewer units, and if the student goes beyond expectations, a professor may give student more units. This system aims to promote a non-competitive atmosphere that focuses more on the student learning the material rather than learning how to take a test.

CCS students are afforded many privileges to help in the pursuit of their education.

*Fewer prerequisites: If a CCS student can show a capability of taking an upper division or graduate class, even without the prerequisites, the college greatly facilitates the process of getting the student in that class.
*Drop class and change grading: CCS students may drop any class up until the last day of instruction. This privilege is given as a backup if a student happens to try taking advanced classes or more classes than the usual student. They may also change their grading between letter grade or pass/no-pass for classes outside CCS.
*Priority registration: CCS students are among the first students at UC Santa Barbara to sign up for classes each quarter. They sign up at the same time as honors students and athletes.
*Higher unit cap: CCS students have a unit cap of 95.5 units per quarter. However, most students take between 15 and 25 units a quarter.
*Building access: All CCS students have their access card registered at the CCS Advising Office and can enter the building with a registered card through the electronic locks at side entrances from 7:30 AM to 10:00 PM. 
*Computer Lab: CCS students have a computer lab in the building where they have free Internet access, printing and photocopying.
*Library checkout: CCS students get quarter-long check-out from the UC Santa Barbara library and may renew materials up to five times.
*SURF: All CCS students are eligible to apply for the college&#x27;s summer undergraduate research fellowships. The standard package for one student is a stipend supporting a 10-12-week project.

== The building ==

The College of Creative Studies is housed in its own single story building, number 494, located between campus dorms, a dining commons, and the University Center. The building was built during World War II and shares the title as the oldest building at UC Santa Barbara with the other buildings left from when the campus was a marine base.

The building contains classrooms, art studios, faculty and administrative offices, an art gallery, computer labs, print and wood shops and a small 100 person theater. For most of its life it was painted brown, but in early 2005 the administrative offices were painted yellow, the college proper was painted green and the Old Little Theatre was painted red.

The building acts as a &quot;home base&quot; for its students, who spend time in the building studying and socializing. Students are allowed to personalize the building, so the walls have stickers and art, classrooms contain couches and modified desks and there are a few roaming stuffed animals.

Although many students and staff members are fond of the building, the college has outgrown it and is looking for funds to renovate it and/or build new facilities.

<doc id="255785" wikidata="Q4972489" url="?curid=255785" title="Broadway Open House">
<text>Broadway Open House is network television&#x27;s first late-night comedy-variety series. It was telecast live on NBC from May 29, 1950, to August 24, 1951, airing weeknights from 11pm to midnight. One of the pioneering TV creations of NBC president Pat Weaver, it demonstrated the potential for late-night programming and led to the later development of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

==Hosts==
The show was originally planned to be hosted by comic Don &quot;Creesh&quot; Hornsby (so named because he yelled &quot;Creesh&quot; often). Hornsby had been brought into the variety show business by Bob Hope, whose topical humor would serve as the basis for most of the late-night talk shows that would follow. One week before he was to begin hosting, the 26-year-old Hornsby suddenly contracted polio, from which he died on the day he was to host his first show, May 22, 1950. Hornsby&#x27;s sudden demise forced NBC to postpone the show and rush to find new hosts on short notice. For the first few weeks, there were different hosts including Dean Martin &amp; Jerry Lewis, Henny Youngman and Robert Alda, among others, with Morey Amsterdam hosting Mondays and Wednesdays.

&quot;Broadway Open House&quot; was performed before a live studio audience, in the manner of a stage show. Pat Weaver, an NBC executive at the time, noticed the positive feedback that Jerry Lester (then hosting &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; for Dumont) and his manic personality had received on a recent appearance on NBC and offered Lester the hosting position almost immediately. Lester initially hosted the Tuesday, Thursday and Friday episodes of &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; until Amsterdam exited the show, leaving Lester the sole host. Lester performed sketches with his crew of sidekicks (including some of the earliest TV appearances of brassy Barbara Nichols), running through standard nightclub comedy routines and introducing the show&#x27;s vocal group, the Mello Larks. Lester&#x27;s signature bit was to twist his eyeglasses at a 45-degree angle on his face. The show had occasional guests, including Lenny Bruce, who appeared May 1950 and Charlie Parker who appeared October 31, 1950 (an audio recording exists of his appearance on the show), and there were also audience participation bits, such as having women from the audience join the female cast members in modeling fur coats. Lester&#x27;s fondness for bean bags became a running gag on the series. The sponsors included Anchor Hocking glassware and Blatz Beer.

==Cast and crew==
Other &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; cast members were tap dancer Ray Malone, accordionist Milton DeLugg, announcer Wayne Howell and vocalists Jane Harvey, Andy Roberts and David Street. The show&#x27;s opening theme music was &quot;The Beanbag Song&quot; by DeLugg, Lester and Willie Stein. A second theme was the song &quot;It&#x27;s Almost Like Being in Love.&quot; DeLugg often played a song he wrote with Stein, &quot;Orange Colored Sky&quot;, which became a hit for both Lester and for Nat King Cole.

Vic McLeod, Paul Munro, Ray Buffum and Jac Hein were among the producers. Hein, Munro and Joseph C. Cavalier directed. Stan Burns, Allan Sherman, Art Henley, Alan Sands, and Cal Howard were the writers. The program was developed by Sylvester &quot;Pat&quot; Weaver, a programming vice-president at NBC who had started his career as a production assistant on Fred Allen&#x27;s radio show &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; in the 1930s. After the 15-month run of &quot;Broadway Open House&quot;, Weaver further developed his ideas on a local show over NBC&#x27;s New York station starring Steve Allen, which eventually took to the network in 1954 as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. There are those who dispute Weaver&#x27;s credit for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, including hosts Steve Allen and Jack Paar. Years later, Paar said &quot;He didn&#x27;t invent programs, but wrote great memos.&quot;

==Dagmar arrives==
Network variety shows were broadcast weekly, with the production staff having one week to create each new episode. &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; was under much more pressure, and it was a continuing challenge to come up with fresh material on a nightly basis. Starlet Jennie Lewis was given no script and told, &quot;You just sit there and act dumb. Your name is Dagmar.&quot; With her new name, she sat on a stool with a sign around her neck saying &quot;Girl Singer,&quot; did breathing exercises, and soon performed as a reader of poems and plays, while Lester made occasional jokes about her &quot;hidden talents.&quot; Her appearances created a sensation, leading to much press coverage and a salary increase from $75 to $1,250. Lester was now in the peculiar position of being the second banana on his own show, and he asked NBC to put him on another program. Lester left &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; in May 1951, and Dagmar carried on as host. On July 16, 1951, she was featured on the front cover of &quot;Life&quot;, and the show came to an end one month later.

Lester was retained as a rotating host for a new early prime-time variety show the next season, &quot;Chesterfield Sound-Off Time&quot;, along with Fred Allen and Bob Hope. NBC filled the late-night time slot for the next year with &quot;Mary Kay&#x27;s Nightcap&quot;, a non-comic show in which Mary Kay Stearns previewed the next day&#x27;s programming. For a short time, Dagmar was given a weekly late-night show entitled &quot;Dagmar&#x27;s Canteen&quot;. The show&#x27;s even later time slot (12:15 a.m. Sunday morning) and the lack of a comic partner for Dagmar to foil were factors in the show being short-lived.

Dagmar&#x27;s run on &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; and her appearances on other shows (&quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;, &quot;Masquerade Party&quot;) made her the first major female star of television. She continued making guest appearances during the late 1950s with Jack Paar on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

Steve Allen remembered Hornsby, &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; and Fred Allen in a 1997 interview.
==Reception==
&quot;Broadway Open House&quot; was an early influence on the comedy stylings of George Carlin who spoke of the show in an interview with the Television Academy recorded December 17, 2007. Carlin prefaced the description of the show with other variety shows of the time, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;.

==Episode status==
No episodes from Amsterdam&#x27;s hosting run exist. A limited number of episodes from Lester&#x27;s run have survived and are archived at the Paley Center for Media.

<text>Avant-garde jazz (also known as avant-jazz, experimental jazz, or &quot;new thing&quot;) is a style of music and improvisation that combines avant-garde art music and composition with jazz. It originated in the early 1950s and developed through to the late 1960s. One of the earliest developments within avant-garde jazz was that of free jazz, and the two terms were originally synonymous. Much avant-garde jazz is stylistically distinct, however, in that it lacks free jazz&#x27;s thoroughly improvised nature and is either fully or partially composed.

==History==

===1950s===
Avant-garde jazz originated in the mid- to late 1950s among a group of improvisors who rejected the conventions of bebop and post bop in an effort to blur the division between the written and the spontaneous. Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor led the way, soon to be joined by John Coltrane. Some would come to apply it differently from free jazz, emphasizing structure and organization by the use of composed melodies, shifting but nevertheless predetermined meters and tonalities, and distinctions between soloists and accompaniment.

===1960s===
In Chicago, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians began pursuing their own variety of avant-garde jazz. The AACM musicians (Muhal Richard Abrams, Anthony Braxton, Roscoe Mitchell, Hamid Drake, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago) tended towards eclecticism. Poet Amiri Baraka, an important figure in the Black Arts Movement (BAM), recorded spoken word tracks with the New York Art Quartet (“Black Dada Nihilismus,” 1964, ESP) and Sunny Murray (“Black Art,” 1965, Jihad).

<text>The County of Edessa (Latin: &quot;Comitatus Edessanus&quot;) was a 12th-century Crusader state in Upper Mesopotamia. Its seat was the city of Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey).

In the late Byzantine period, Edessa became the centre of intellectual life within the Syriac Orthodox Church. As such it also became the centre for the translation of Ancient Greek philosophy into Syriac, which provided a stepping stone for the subsequent translations into Arabic. When the crusades arrived, it was still important enough to tempt a side-expedition after the siege of Antioch.

Baldwin of Boulogne, the first count of Edessa, became king of Jerusalem, and subsequent counts were his cousins. Unlike the other Crusader states, the county was landlocked. It was remote from the other states and was not on particularly good terms with its closest neighbor, the Principality of Antioch. Half of the county, including its capital, was located east of the Euphrates, far to the east, rendering it particularly vulnerable. The west part of the Euphrates was controlled from the stronghold of Turbessel. The eastern border of Edessa was the Tigris, but the County may not have extended quite that far.

The fall of Edessa in 1144 was the first major setback for Outremer and provoked the Second Crusade. All the later Crusades, however, were troubled by strategic uncertainties and disagreements. The Second Crusade did not even try to recover Edessa, calculating it to be strategically better to take Damascus. But the campaign failed and Edessa was lost for the Christians.
== History of Edessa ==
=== Founding ===
In 1098, Baldwin of Boulogne left the main Crusading army, which was travelling south towards Antioch and Jerusalem. He went first south into Cilicia, then east to Edessa, where he convinced its lord, Thoros, to adopt him as son and heir. He also married Thoros&#x27; daughter, Arda of Armenia, who eventually became the first queen of Jerusalem. Thoros was a Christian of Armenian origin but of Greek Orthodox religion and largely disliked by his Armenian Apostolic subjects, which led to his removal from power in March 1098. Different sources claim he was assassinated or abdicated, and it is debated whether Baldwin played a role in this. Nonetheless, Baldwin succeeded Thoros as ruler, taking the title of count (having been Count of Verdun as a vassal of his brother in Europe).

In 1100, Baldwin became King of Jerusalem when his brother, Godfrey of Bouillon, died. The County of Edessa passed to his cousin Baldwin of Bourcq. He was joined by Joscelin of Courtenay, who became lord of the fortress of Turbessel on the Euphrates, an important outpost against the Seljuk Turks.

The Frankish lords formed a good rapport with their Armenian subjects, and there were frequent intermarriages; the first three counts all married Armenians. Count Baldwin&#x27;s wife had died in Marash in 1097, and after he succeeded to Edessa he married Arda, a granddaughter of the Armenian Roupenid Prince Constantine. Baldwin of Bourcq married Morphia, a daughter of Gabriel of Melitene, and Joscelin of Courtenay married a daughter of Constantine.

=== Conflicts with Muslim neighbours ===
Baldwin II quickly became involved in the affairs of northern Assyria and Asia Minor. He helped secure the ransom of Bohemond I of Antioch from the Danishmends in 1103, and, with Antioch, attacked the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia in 1104. 
Later in 1104, Edessa was attacked by Mosul, and both Baldwin and Joscelin were taken prisoner after their defeat at the Battle of Harran. Bohemond&#x27;s cousin Tancred became regent in Edessa (although Richard of Salerno actually governed the territory), until Baldwin and Joscelin were ransomed in 1108. Baldwin had to fight to regain control of the city; Tancred was eventually defeated, though Baldwin had to ally with some of the local Muslim rulers.

In 1110, all lands east of the Euphrates were lost to Mawdud of Mosul. This was not followed by an assault on Edessa itself as the Muslim rulers were more concerned with consolidating their own power.

Baldwin II became King of Jerusalem (also as Baldwin II) when Baldwin I died in 1118. Although Eustace of Boulogne had a better claim as the late Baldwin&#x27;s brother, he was in France and did not want the title. Edessa was given to Joscelin in 1119. Joscelin was taken prisoner once again in 1122; when Baldwin came to rescue him, he too was captured, and Jerusalem was left without its king. Joscelin escaped in 1123, and obtained Baldwin&#x27;s release the next year.

=== Fall of the county ===
Joscelin was gravely injured during a siege in 1131 and was succeeded by his son Joscelin II. By this time, Zengi had united Aleppo and Mosul and began to threaten Edessa. 
Meanwhile, Joscelin II paid little attention to the security of his county, and argued with the counts of Tripoli who then refused to come to his aid. Zengi besieged the city in 1144, capturing it on 24 December that year. Joscelin continued to rule his lands west of the Euphrates, and he also managed to take advantage of the death of Zengi in September 1146 to regain and briefly hold his old capital. The city was again lost in November, and Joscelin barely escaped. In 1150 he was captured by Zengi&#x27;s son Nur ad-Din, and was kept a prisoner in Aleppo until he died in 1159. His wife sold Turbessel and what was left of the county to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, but these lands were conquered by Nur ad-Din and the Sultan of Rum within a year. Edessa was the first Crusader state to be created, and also the first to be lost.

== Population and demographics ==

Edessa was one of the largest of the Crusader states in terms of territory but had one of the smallest populations. Edessa itself had about 10,000 inhabitants. The rest of the county consisted mostly of fortresses. The county&#x27;s territory extended from Antioch in the west to across the Euphrates in the east at its greatest extent. It also often occupied land as far north as Armenia proper. To the south and east were the powerful Muslim cities of Aleppo and Mosul, and the Jazira (northern Iraq). The inhabitants were mostly Syriac Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox Christians, with some Greek Orthodox Christians and Arab Muslims. Although the numbers of Latins always remained small, there was a Roman Catholic archbishop. The fall of the city was the catalyst for the Second Crusade in 1146.

==Government==
=== Counts of Edessa===
* Baldwin I 1098–1100
* Baldwin II 1100–1118
**Tancred of Galilee as regent, with Richard of Salerno as governor (1104–1108)
* Joscelin I 1118–1131
* Joscelin II 1131–1144, d. 1159
* &quot;Joscelin III, titular count from 1159
* &quot;Beatrice, titular countess from ‍1200&quot;

=== Lordship of Turbessel ===
Turbessel was firstly the lordship of Joscelin I when he was not yet the count of Edessa. It controlled the area west of the Euphrates, and held the border against Antioch. It then was a special holding of Courtenay counts of Edessa, and again became their seat after the loss of the city of Edessa. It was sold with the remaining parts of the county to the Byzantines just before it was conquered by Muslims. After the sale, the wife and family of Joscelin II moved with the proceeds to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, near Acre.

<doc id="255791" wikidata="Q1583807" url="?curid=255791" title="Art music">
<text>Art music (alternatively called classical music, cultivated music, serious music, and canonic music) is music considered to be of high phonoaesthetic value. It typically implies advanced structural and theoretical considerations or a written musical tradition. In this context, the terms &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;cultivated&quot; are frequently used to present a contrast with ordinary, everyday music (i.e. popular and folk music, also called &quot;vernacular music&quot;). Many cultures have art music traditions; in the Western world, the term typically refers to Western classical music.

==Definition==
In Western literature, &quot;Art music&quot; is mostly used to refer to music descending from the tradition of Western classical music. Musicologist Philip Tagg refers to the elitism associated with art music as one of an &quot;axiomatic triangle consisting of &#x27;folk&#x27;, &#x27;art&#x27; and &#x27;popular&#x27; musics&quot;. He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria. According to Bruno Nettl, &quot;Western classical music&quot; may also be synonymous with &quot;art music&quot;, &quot;canonic music&quot;, &quot;cultivated music&quot;, &quot;serious music&quot;, as well as the more flippantly used &quot;real music&quot; and &quot;normal music&quot;. Musician Catherine Schmidt-Jones defines art music as &quot;a music which requires significantly more work by the listener to fully appreciate than is typical of popular music&quot;. In her view, &quot;[t]his can include the more challenging types of jazz and rock music, as well as Classical&quot;.

The term &quot;art music&quot; refers primarily to classical traditions (including contemporary as well as historical classical music forms) that focus on formal styles, invite technical and detailed deconstruction and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In strict western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition, preserved in some form of music notation, as opposed to being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings (like popular and traditional music).

==Popular music==

There have been continual attempts throughout the history of popular music to make a claim for itself as art rather than as popular culture, and a number of music styles that were previously understood as &quot;popular music&quot; have since been categorized in the art or classical category. According to the academic Tim Wall, the most significant example of the struggle between Tin Pan Alley, African-American, vernacular, and art discourses was in jazz. As early as the 1930s, artists attempted to cultivate ideas of &quot;symphonic jazz&quot;, taking it away from its perceived vernacular and black American roots. Following these developments, histories of popular music tend to marginalize jazz, partly because the reformulation of jazz in the art discourse has been so successful that many (as of 2013) would not consider it a form of popular music.

At the beginning of the 20th century, art music was divided into &quot;serious music&quot; and &quot;light music&quot;. During the second half of the century, there was a large-scale trend in American culture toward blurring the boundaries between art and pop music. Beginning in 1966, the degree of social and artistic dialogue among rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands who fused elements of composed music with the oral musical traditions of rock. During the late 1960s and 1970s, progressive rock bands represented a form of crossover music that combined rock with high art musical forms either through quotation, allusion, or imitation. Progressive music may be equated with explicit references to aspects of art music, sometimes resulting in the reification of rock as art music.

While progressive rock is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, as author Kevin Holm-Hudson explains: &quot;sometimes progressive rock fails to integrate classical sources ... [it] moves continuously between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived not only from European art music, but other cultural domains (such as East Indian, Celtic, folk, and African) and hence involves a continuous aesthetic movement between formalism and eclecticism&quot;.

<doc id="255797" wikidata="Q3556884" url="?curid=255797" title="Deputy Prime Minister of Canada">
<text>The deputy prime minister of Canada () is a minister of the Crown and a member of the Canadian Cabinet. The office is conferred at the discretion of the prime minister and does not have an associated departmental portfolio. Canadian deputy prime ministers are appointed to the Privy Council and styled as the Honourable (), a privilege maintained for life.

The position is currently vacant. Chrystia Freeland was the tenth and most recent deputy prime minister of Canada, holding the role from November 20, 2019 until her resignation on December 16, 2024. While deputy prime minister, she served concurrently first as minister of intergovernmental affairs then as minister of finance.

The position of deputy prime minister was vacant during the entirety of the Stephen Harper premiership and the first term of the Justin Trudeau premiership.

The deputy prime minister should not be confused with the position of the clerk of the Privy Council, who is effectively the deputy minister (the senior civil servant in a department) of the prime minister&#x27;s department (which is the Privy Council Office).

==History==
The position of deputy prime minister was created by Pierre Trudeau in 1977, largely to recognize the long years of service of Allan MacEachen. Before then, Trudeau had given the title of &quot;senior minister&quot; to a member of his cabinet. The last to occupy that position was Paul Hellyer.

Joe Clark&#x27;s government did not have a deputy prime minister. Similarly, Prime Minister Stephen Harper did not designate a deputy prime minister, nor did Prime Minister Justin Trudeau until the appointment of Chrystia Freeland, (who resigned from this position on December 16, 2024), in his second mandate. Prior to Freeland&#x27;s appointment, Canada&#x27;s most recent deputy prime minister was Anne McLellan, who in 2006, was also the first deputy prime minister to lose her seat in the House of Commons.

Harper gave special status in the line of authority to members of his cabinet: under an Order in Council issued on February 6, 2006—the day Harper was appointed prime minister—when &quot;the prime minister is unable to perform the functions of his office&quot;, Lawrence Cannon, then Jim Prentice, then the balance of the Cabinet by order of precedence, were &quot;authorized to act for the prime minister&quot;. This order was followed by a number of others updating the list; in each case, the status as the top person on that list was accorded to the vice-chair of the cabinet&#x27;s Priorities and Planning Committee. Previous prime ministers have had similar orders-in-council, under which the deputy prime minister and then the balance of the Cabinet, in order of precedence, have been authorized to act for the prime minister. Media analysts generally credited the top person on these lists as being the &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister, although the title was never conferred. These &quot;order of precedence&quot; lists have no status as a formal line of succession, however, and would carry no special weight in determining who would take over as the new prime minister if an incumbent died in office or was forced to suddenly resign in advance of a leadership convention.

Cannon seconded the &quot;pro forma&quot; bill to start the first session of the 39th Canadian Parliament; the bill is introduced before the House takes the Speech from the Throne under consideration to maintain the right of the House to consider matters other than those directed to it by the crown. Traditionally, either the deputy prime minister or government house leader seconds this bill.

Similarly, no deputy prime minister was named in the first cabinet of incumbent prime minister Justin Trudeau. Ralph Goodale was deputy leader of the Liberal Party and had been ranked first in the &quot;order of precedence&quot; in the cabinet, and an order in council designated him as first in line to assume the prime minister&#x27;s duties in the event Trudeau ever became incapacitated. However, media analysts focused on Dominic Leblanc, who despite having been lower in the official order of precedence served on numerous cabinet committees and as the government&#x27;s liaison with the Senate, as being the &quot;de facto deputy prime minister&quot;.

Following the 2019 federal election, which saw the Liberals returned to power in a minority government but being shut out of the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, Goodale was defeated in the Saskatchewan riding of Regina—Wascana, while Leblanc was reelected in his New Brunswick riding of Beauséjour but on medical leave due to recovery from cancer treatment. The Liberals were pressed to respond to concerns about lack of representation in cabinet from the prairie provinces potentially driving sentiments of western alienation. On November 20, 2019, Trudeau appointed Chrystia Freeland, who represents the Toronto riding of University—Rosedale in Parliament but was born in Peace River, Alberta and grew up in Alberta, as the deputy prime minister.

On December 16, 2024, Chrystia Freeland resigned from cabinet as finance minister and in turn as deputy prime minister. Her successor, Dominic LeBlanc, replaced her as finance minister but was not appointed to the post of deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Trudeau, with the position once again falling into disuse.

==Duties==
The official duties of the deputy prime minister are to answer questions pertaining to overall government policy during Question Period and to chair the Cabinet in the absence of the prime minister. The office has no standing in law and does not carry any formal duties or tasks—that is, it is without a portfolio—though, the prime minister may negotiate or assign specific tasks in conjunction with the title. With the exception of Herb Gray, all deputy prime ministers have held another ministerial portfolio alongside this title.

According to journalist Joseph Brean of the Postmedia Network, the role can sometimes be &quot;a poisoned chalice, or a leash to keep a rival under close control&quot; rather than an indication that the Prime Minister trusts the authority of the deputy. For the political analysis magazine &quot;Policy Options&quot; Eugene Lang and Greg Schmidt describe the role as one of &quot;soft power&quot;, in which a deputy prime minister only carries as much or as little power within a government as the prime minister chooses to permit them; the level of power is usually communicated less by the deputy prime minister&#x27;s title itself, and more by what other roles they do or don&#x27;t hold alongside it.

One deputy prime minister, Sheila Copps, attracted controversy in 1993 after asserting that she was &quot;in charge&quot; of government business while the then prime minister, Jean Chrétien, was on a brief holiday. After she left politics, she wrote that although the position of deputy prime minister is only ceremonial, &quot;very often, the DPM&#x27;s job was to protect the prime minister from the political damage that Question Period can inflict on a leader&quot;, further citing the experience of Erik Nielsen during the Sinclair Stevens scandal.

==Succession==
Unlike the role of vice president in some presidential systems, the deputy prime minister does not automatically assume the office of prime minister if the incumbent of the latter office dies or resigns. Although they may serve in an acting capacity on a temporary caretaker basis to ensure continuity of government function during the immediate period of transition, the deputy prime minister does not automatically become the new permanent prime minister; rather, constitutional convention requires the governor general to consult the governing party regarding the leadership, and to call on a member of that party&#x27;s caucus to assume the prime ministership. No policy or convention precludes the deputy prime minister from being chosen as the new prime minister in such a scenario, but none assures it, either—the party caucus would be free to recommend any new leader of its choice to the governor general. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the governor general is expected to follow the wishes of the party, although officially they retain the authority to make the final decision. That being the case, no prime minister has died in office or resigned suddenly (except following his or her party&#x27;s electoral defeat) since the 1890s, many decades before the office of deputy prime minister was created.

Extended notice is usually given when a sitting prime minister does not plan to lead his/her party into another election. Leadership contests to determine the successor to a prime minister are usually held during the final days of the incumbent&#x27;s term, and are traditionally a lengthy and competitive process. In almost all cases, the outgoing prime minister hands over power directly to their designated successor, without any interim prime minister. By contrast, during leadership contests for the official opposition party, the leader of the opposition has often (though not always) been occupied by an interim parliamentary leader. The opposition party&#x27;s deputy leader (assuming that post is occupied) is often chosen for this role unless they plan to run in the leadership election, in which case someone else would be chosen since it would be considered harmful to the election process if the interim leader was to be one of the candidates.

Legally speaking, any interim prime minister appointed by the governor general would not merely be acting on behalf of the prime minister, but would have the full powers and prerogatives of any other prime minister.

==List of deputy prime ministers==
Key:



==Acting prime minister==
Prior to the creation of the position of deputy prime minister, a prime minister would routinely name a member of the cabinet to temporarily act on the prime minister&#x27;s behalf while the prime minister was away from the regular duties of his job for a period of time, such as being out of the country on a working visit or a vacation. The delegate was thus a caretaker, whose role was to oversee the routine day-to-day functioning of the government and cabinet during the prime minister&#x27;s absence; for example, in his capacity as acting prime minister, Mitchell Sharp ordered a precautionary one-day shutdown of government offices in Ottawa on August 20, 1970, as the storm that had spawned the Sudbury tornado headed toward Ottawa. An acting prime minister did not otherwise have the authority to act independently of the sitting prime minister in a legislative or political capacity, nor would an acting prime minister be considered to have actually served as prime minister. As well the acting prime minister was not given the title The Right Honourable, even during the acting period, although some people who served as acting prime ministers may have independently earned that distinction for other reasons.

Due to the routine and relatively minor nature of the role, few to no research sources exist to provide a complete list of everyone who was ever named as acting prime minister. However, John Diefenbaker&#x27;s selection of Ellen Fairclough as acting prime minister on February 19 and 20, 1958, is historically noteworthy as Fairclough was the first woman ever designated.

==Senior Minister==

Prior to the creation of this position, the position of &quot;Senior Minister&quot; was a ceremonial position used in a similar manner, heading the order of precedence. Upon the absence of the prime minister, the senior minister would act on behalf of the prime minister.

<text>Achromatopsia, also known as rod monochromacy, is a medical syndrome that exhibits symptoms relating to five conditions, most notably monochromacy. Historically, the name referred to monochromacy in general, but now typically refers only to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision condition. The term is also used to describe cerebral achromatopsia, though monochromacy is usually the only common symptom. The conditions include: monochromatic color blindness, poor visual acuity, and day-blindness. The syndrome is also present in an &quot;incomplete&quot; form that exhibits milder symptoms, including residual color vision. Achromatopsia is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 live births worldwide.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The five symptoms associated with achromatopsia are:
# Color blindness – usually monochromacy
# Reduced visual acuity – uncorrectable with lenses
# Hemeralopia – with the subject exhibiting photophobia
# Nystagmus
# Iris operating abnormalities

The syndrome is typically first noticed in children around six months of age due to their photophobia or their nystagmus. The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first six to seven years of life – but remain near 20/200. Otherwise the syndrome is considered stationary and does not worsen with age.

If the light level during testing is optimized, achromats may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color. The fundus of the eye appears completely normal.

Achromatopsia can be classified as &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot;. In general, symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia are attenuated versions of those of complete achromatopsia. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Incomplete achromats show only partial impairment of cone cell function.

== Cause ==
Achromatopsia is sometimes called rod monochromacy (as opposed to blue cone monochromacy), as achromats exhibit a complete absence of cone cell activity via electroretinography in photopic lighting. There are at least four genetic causes of achromatopsia, two of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (ACHM2, ACHM3), a third involves the cone photoreceptor transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.

Known genetic causes of this include mutations in the cone cell cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3), the cone cell transducin, GNAT2 (ACHM4), subunits of cone phosphodiesterase PDE6C (ACHM5, OMIM 613093) and PDEH (ACHM6, OMIM 610024), and ATF6 (ACHM7, OMIM 616517).

== Pathophysiology ==

The hemeralopic aspect of achromatopsia can be diagnosed non-invasively using electroretinography. The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent. The mesopic level is approximately a hundred times lower than the clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram. When as described; the condition is due to a saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se.

In general, the molecular pathomechanism of achromatopsia is either the inability to properly control or respond to altered levels of cGMP; particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release. Native retinal CNGs are composed of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in cone cells. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas this is not the case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability (Na+ vs. K+ and Ca2+), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward rectification, current flickering, and sensitivity to block by L-cis-diltiazem.

Mutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function—often increased affinity for cGMP—of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the cone cell transducin, GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by photons. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia phenotype.

Molecular diagnosis can be established by identification of biallelic variants in the causative genes. Molecular genetic testing approaches used in achromatopsia can include targeted analysis for the common CNGB3 variant c.1148delC (p.Thr383IlefsTer13), use of a multigenerational panel, or comprehensive genomic testing.

=== ACHM2 ===
While some mutations in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, at least one mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Others include the introduction of a sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased calcium permeability.

When mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability. While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca2+ leads to achromatopsia, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1 region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface. Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the cone cell&#x27;s ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1 region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.

=== ACHM3 ===
While very few mutations in CNGB3 have been characterized, the vast majority of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non-functional. This will largely result in haploinsufficiency, though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a dominant negative fashion. The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation, T383IfsX12, results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the cell membrane.

The three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties, with one underlying theme. The R403Q mutation, which lies in the pore region of the channel, results in an increase in outward current rectification, versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels, concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity. The other mutations show either increased (S435F) or decreased (F525N) surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP. It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change. Such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina.

=== ACHM4 ===
Upon activation by light, cone opsin causes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein) α-transducing activity polypeptide 2 (GNAT2). This causes the release of the activated α-subunit from the inhibitory β/γ-subunits. This α-subunit then activates a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3 channels. As this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing it is not surprising that mutations in GNAT2 lead to achromatopsia. The known mutations in this gene, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, cone opsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or photoreceptor membrane hyperpolarization.

== Management ==
===Gene therapy===

As achromatopsia is linked to only a few single-gene mutations, it is a good candidate for gene therapy. Gene therapy is a technique for injecting functional genes into the cells that need them, replacing or overruling the original alleles linked to achromatopsia, thereby curing it – at least in part. Achromatopsia has been a focus of gene therapy since 2010, when achromatopsia in dogs was partially cured. Several clinical trials on humans are ongoing with mixed results. In July 2023, a study found positive but limited improvements on congenital CNGA3 achromatopsia.

===Eyeborg===
Since 2003, a cybernetic device called the eyeborg has allowed people to perceive color through sound waves. This form of Sensory substitution maps the hue perceived by a camera worn on the head to a pitch experienced through bone conduction according to a sonochromatic scale. This allows achromats (or even the totally blind) to perceive – or estimate – the color of an object. Achromat and artist Neil Harbisson was the first to use the eyeborg in early 2004, which allowed him to start painting in color. He has since acted as a spokesperson for the technology, namely in a 2012 TED Talk. A 2015 study suggests that achromats who use the Eyeborg for several years exhibit neural plasticity, which indicates the sensory substitution has become intuitive for them.

===Other accommodations===
While gene therapy and the Eyeborg may currently have low uptake with achromats, there are several more practical ways for achromats to manage their condition:
* Some colors can be estimated through the use of colored filters. By comparing the luminosity of a color with and without a filter (or between two different filters), the color can be estimated. This is the premise of monocular lenses and the SeeKey. In some US states, achromats can use a red filter while driving to determine the color of a traffic light.
* To alleviate photophobia stemming from hemeralopia, dark red or plum colored filters as either sunglasses or tinted contacts are very helpful at decreasing light sensitivity.
* To manage the low visual acuity that is typical of achromatopsia, achromats may use telescopic systems, specifically when driving, to increase the resolution of an object of interest.

== Epidemiology ==
Achromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1 in 30,000 people.

However, on the small Micronesian atoll of Pingelap, approximately five percent of the atoll&#x27;s 3,000 inhabitants are affected. This is the result of a population bottleneck caused by a typhoon and ensuing famine in the 1770s, which killed all but about twenty islanders, including one who was heterozygous for achromatopsia.

The people of this region have termed achromatopsia &quot;maskun&quot;, which literally means &quot;not see&quot; in Pingelapese. This unusual population drew neurologist Oliver Sacks to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book, &quot;The Island of the Colorblind&quot;.

== Blue cone monochromacy ==

Blue cone monochromacy (BCM) is another genetic condition causing monochromacy. It mimics many of the symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia and before the discovery of its molecular biological basis was commonly referred to as &quot;x-linked achromatopsia&quot;, &quot;sex-linked achromatopsia&quot; or &quot;atypical achromatopsia&quot;. BCM stems from mutations or deletions of the OPN1LW and OPN1MW genes, both on the X chromosome. As a recessive x-linked condition, BCM disproportionately affects males, unlike typical achromatopsia.

== Cerebral achromatopsia ==

Cerebral achromatopsia is a form of acquired color blindness that is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex. Damage is most commonly localized to visual area V4 of the visual cortex (the major part of the colour center), which receives information from the parvocellular pathway involved in color processing. It is most frequently caused by physical trauma, hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth. If there is unilateral damage, a loss of color perception in only half of the visual field may result; this is known as hemiachromatopsia. Cerebral achromats usually do not experience the other major symptoms of congenital achromatopsia, since photopic vision still functions.

Color agnosia involves having difficulty recognizing colors, while still being able to perceive them as measured by a color matching or categorizing task.

References to them were made in several other &quot;Next Generation&quot; episodes, but they did not appear until the 1996 fourth season &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Indiscretion&quot;. On &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, they played a significant role in the final story arc of the series in 1999, during which much information about them was revealed. The Breen&#x27;s true appearance remained unknown to viewers until the 2024 fifth season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; episode &quot;Mirrors&quot; while flashing back to reveal the history of the character L’ak.

==Production history==
The Breen were first mentioned in &quot;The Loss&quot;, a fourth-season episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; which first aired in 1990. The episode established their race as one of several alien species to be unreadable by empaths, much like the Ferengi. References to them were made in several other &quot;Next Generation&quot; (&quot;Hero Worship&quot; S05 E11) and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episodes but they were not seen until the 1996 &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Indiscretion&quot;, which aired as part of that show&#x27;s fourth season. They were depicted as running a mining facility from which Gul Dukat and Major Kira rescued Dukat&#x27;s daughter, Tora Ziyal. According to &quot;DS9&quot; writer/producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe, after having previously been treated as red herrings since their first mention on &quot;Next Generation&quot;, and as a running joke by the production staff because &quot;they were these people who were out there who were dangerous but were never really responsible for any of the trouble going on&quot;, they would finally be used as the villains in an episode. Their true appearance would be concealed beneath masks, according to writer/producer Ira Steven Behr, because &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really in the mood to come up with a new alien race. So I said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s not see them. Let&#x27;s just put them in costume because they normally live in the cold.&#x27;&quot;

The look of the Breen masks, which includes a &quot;snout&quot;, was derived from the visual suggestion that they are a snouted species, like an Arctic wolf. The Breen costumes were problematic for the actors playing them, since they made both seeing and breathing difficult: there was only a single small hole in the beak, about eight inches from the actor&#x27;s nose, according to stand-in and stunt double Todd Slayton, who played Thot Gor. The costumes also included big, clumsy boots, and the outfits were layered like an armadillo, making movement difficult. The helmets, which were complicated to put on and remove, were held together with magnets, and they were prone to falling off when someone bumped into them. The switches for the lights on the helmets were inside the helmets, requiring the actor to remove the helmet to turn the lights on and off. For reasons unknown to production personnel, the nine-volt batteries that powered the lights lasted only minutes.

In keeping with the Breen as a mysterious race, the sounds of the Breen&#x27;s speech were inspired by the Lou Reed album &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;, which the post-production sound staff were instructed to listen to when creating the electronic cackle that served as the Breen&#x27;s voices.

== History and culture ==
The Breen homeworld is called Breen, according to the 1999 &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;, and was said to be a frozen wasteland in &quot;Indiscretion&quot;. However, in the 1999 episode &quot;The Changing Face of Evil&quot;, it was stated by Weyoun that it is in fact rather temperate. Among the Breen, pregnancy at a young age was a common occurrence, according to &quot;Elogium&quot;, a 1995 second season &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode, though it has not been established what is considered &quot;young&quot; in the Breen culture. The Breen have no blood. How the functions normally carried out by blood in other species are carried out in Breen physiology has not been revealed. Although the Breen diet is unknown, Lieutenant Commander Worf and Ezri Dax were given algae paste when they were prisoners of the Breen in &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;.

Historically, the Klingons were among the first to discover the consequences of underestimating the Breen. As revealed in &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;, during the Klingon Second Empire, Chancellor Mow&#x27;ga ordered an entire fleet of Klingon warships to invade and conquer the Breen homeworld. The fleet never returned and was never heard from again. The Romulans have a saying: &quot;Never turn your back on a Breen&quot;. This adage was first stated (and illustrated) in the 1997 fifth season &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;By Inferno&#x27;s Light&quot;, in which a captive Breen grabbed a disruptor pistol from the holster of a Dominion guard, whose back was turned to him in a Dominion asteroid prison, and used it to disintegrate two Dominion guards at the same time as one of them killed the captive. The Breen in question had not done anything besides sit quietly up until that point, giving no indication that he would be a threat.

The Breen established the isolated Breen Confederacy in the Alpha Quadrant (the quadrant of the Milky Way in which Earth is located, as well as the homeworlds of the Ferengi, Cardassians, and portions of the Klingon Empire and Romulan Star Empire). The Breen established outposts near the Black Cluster, according to the 1992 fifth season &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Hero Worship&quot;. They also established mining facilities consisting of Breen guards and slaves kidnapped from spaceships, such as Tora Ziyal, the half-Bajoran daughter of the Cardassian Gul Dukat, whose ship, the &quot;Ravinok&quot;, had crashed on the planet Dozaria, which was controlled by the Breen, as established in &quot;Indiscretion&quot;.

In &quot;Hero Worship&quot; it is mentioned that they have always been politically nonaligned. They later become a powerful ally of the Dominion, a Gamma Quadrant empire, during the Dominion War that was fought during the final two seasons of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The Breen were revealed to have allied with the Dominion in &quot;’Til Death Do Us Part&quot;, the second episode of the nine-episode story arc that served as the final story arc of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; in 1999. After this occurred, the Breen attacked Earth, destroying parts of San Francisco before being repulsed. They also proved a powerful foe during the Battle of Chin&#x27;toka, in which they fought alongside the Cardassians and Dominion against an alliance of the Federation, the Klingon Empire and the Romulan Star Empire. During this battle, the Breen helped destroy a fleet of the alliance&#x27;s ships, including the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;. The Breen also assumed great responsibility in military matters. The leading representatives of the Breen Confederacy, called &quot;Thots&quot; (which Damar, leader of the Cardassian military, compares to his own rank of Legate, in the episode “Strange Bedfellows”), such as Thot Gor and Thot Pran, were given more powers, much to the bitterness of Damar, whose own people had earlier joined the Dominion. This was one of the factors which led to Damar changing sides and leading a rebellion to free Cardassia. After the Cardassians turned against the Dominion, the Dominion and the Breen were defeated in the Battle of Cardassia Prime in &quot;Deep Space Nine&#x27;s&quot; series finale, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Trusted Sources,&quot; the USS &quot;Cerritos&quot; encountered Breen occupying the planet Brekka while on a second contact mission. Three Breen interceptors attacked the &quot;California&quot;-class starship which proved to be no match for them. However, the &quot;Cerritos&quot; was saved by the automated &quot;Texas&quot;-class starship USS &quot;Aledo&quot; which quickly destroyed the Breen starships. In &quot;The Stars at Night,&quot; Vice Admiral Les Buenamigo revealed that he was well aware that the Breen were on Brekka and had set up the &quot;Cerritos&quot; so that Buenamigo would have an excuse to unveil his &quot;Texas&quot;-class ships.

In &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; season 5, the Breen have become the Breen Imperium by 3191 and are mentioned to be fighting over a new leader. Captain Rayner of Starfleet expresses concern that the Breen could pose a threat to the Federation. In a possible future witnessed by Rayner and Michael Burnham, the Breen were sold the technology of the Progenitors by L&#x27;ak and Moll and they used it to destroy the Federation. In &quot;Mirrors,&quot; it&#x27;s revealed that L&#x27;ak himself is actually a Breen and is described as being of royal blood. L&#x27;ak, who was considered an outcast despite being the nephew of the Ruhn Primarch of the Sixth Flight, had abandoned his people after falling in love with Moll. For betraying his people, L&#x27;ak has an &quot;eirgah&quot; on him, a blood bounty, and he and Moll hope that the Progenitors&#x27; technology will be enough to get the Breen to release the bounty on him. In addition, the Breen are shown to have two forms under their suits: a solid humanoid form that the Primarch claims they have evolved beyond and makes them weak to use, and a fluid form that the Primarch refers to as the Breen&#x27;s true face. However, L&#x27;ak believes that both forms are actually one half of them, and that the Breen are in effect rejecting half of themselves. It&#x27;s later revealed that six Breen Primarchs, including Ruhn and Tahal, are at war for the Breen throne. L&#x27;ak, as the last direct descendant of the Breen Emperor, is a crucial political pawn as whoever controls him hold legitimacy in the war for the throne. It&#x27;s also revealed that Rayner&#x27;s homeworld was occupied by forces led by Tahal who killed Rayner&#x27;s family for resisting the occupation.

After Moll and L&#x27;ak are captured by the Federation, Ruhn demands that they be turned over to him while Burnham recognizes Ruhn&#x27;s dreadnaught as the ship that she saw in the future that had destroyed the Federation. In the middle of negotiations, L&#x27;ak injects himself with an overdose of stimulants in order to create a distraction for Moll to escape, but he misjudges the dosage and gives himself a fatal injection despite the best efforts of Dr. Hugh Culber and a Breen medic to save his life. As a result, Ruhn threatens war on the Federation, but Moll, revealing herself to be L&#x27;ak&#x27;s wife, offers up the Progenitors&#x27; technology to Ruhn which would allow him to win his war with the other Primarchs by force. The &quot;Discovery&quot; crew deduces that Moll is hoping to use the Progenitors&#x27; technology to resurrect L&#x27;ak and is using the Breen to do it, now leaving the Breen and the Federation in a race against each other.

Moll subsequently uses Ruhn&#x27;s dishonor and lust for power above all else to instigate a mutiny against him. Moll kills Ruhn and takes control of his forces with the intention to resurrect L&#x27;ak and place him on the throne of the Breen Imperium. Learning about this, Tahal attempts to seize Ruhn&#x27;s forces for herself, but Federation Ambassador Saru intercepts Tahal&#x27;s fleet using the Federation&#x27;s new pathway drive and coerces her into standing down. Finding a structure containing a portal to the technology close to binary prime black holes, the dreadnaught seizes it, forcing a &quot;Discovery&quot; away team to sneak aboard the ship in replicated Breen refrigeration suits and steal it. Moll and Burnham enter the portal before &quot;Discovery&quot; rams the Breen shuttlebay, inflicting heavy damage upon the dreadnaught and casting the portal back into space.

During a final battle for control of the technology, it&#x27;s discovered that L&#x27;ak cannot be resurrected by it. Unable to destroy the dreadnaught, Rayner instead uses &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; spore drive to send it and a scout ship sent by Tahal to the galactic barrier. While both ships survive the jump, it will take them a couple of decades to return.

===Non-canonical information===
In &quot;Zero Sum Game&quot;, the first novel in the 2010–2012 series &quot;Star Trek: Typhon Pact&quot;, writer David Alan Mack establishes that the Breen Confederacy is made up of many separate species, all of which wear suits to disguise their respective appearances and present as a unified Breen identity. The known Breen species are:

*The Amoniri, whose bodies have no blood and which require refrigeration in their suits to survive
*The Fenrisal, whose pronounced snouts give shape to the traditional Breen helmet
*The Paclu, who have four-lobed brains that cannot be read by most telepathic species
*The Silwaan, whose appearance is most humanlike of the Breen subspecies
*The Vironat, a gray-skinned multi-limbed species (introduced in the sixth novel in the series, &quot;Plagues of Night&quot; by David R. George III)

== Technology and equipment ==
In &quot;Scorpion&quot;, 1997 the third-season finale of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, Lieutenant Tuvok states that the Breen use organic technology in their ships when discussing the bio-organic starships of Species 8472. Their ships are armed with cloaking devices and disruptor-type weapons, according to &quot;Hero Worship&quot;.

In &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; Riker mentions the Breen as one of only three species with access to Type-III hand-held disruptors.

During the Battle of Chin&#x27;toka, a Dominion War battle that occurred in the episode &quot;The Changing Face of Evil&quot;, the Breen employ an energy-damping weapon that could shut down all systems on Alliance ships. The Klingons subsequently discover an engine modification that renders Klingon ships immune to this weapon, though it does not work on Federation or Romulan ships since they are powered differently. The Breen used this weapon to great effect, completely immobilizing the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;, and a fleet of alliance ships, allowing the Breen to destroy them at their leisure.

The helmet of the Breen suits consists of a visor that either glows green, or has small green and red lights on it, and a detachable &quot;beak&quot;. The Breen&#x27;s suits come in two types. The first is a standard suit that is worn by most of the Breen. The second is a more ornate version worn by Thots or other officials that has gold lining and distinctive gold stripes running down the top of the helmet and the &quot;beak&quot;, as seen in later episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, such as &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;.

In an alternate timeline witnessed in the &quot;Face the Strange&quot; episode of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&#x27;s&quot; fifth season, the Breen were sold the technology of the Progenitors, a race that had seeded the galaxy with humanoid life, and they used it to wipe out the Federation.

In &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&#x27;s&quot; fifth season, the Breen have massive dreadnaught-class ships with shields so powerful that they can block the Federation&#x27;s scanners.

The non-canonical book &quot;Legends of the Ferengi&quot; claims that the Ferengi were sold warp technology by a Breen they called &quot;the Masked Breen&quot; (because they did not know the Breen all wore masks). In return, they gave the Breen both poles of Ferenginar (the Ferengi homeworld), several comets, and a frozen moon.

==Other appearances==
A Breen participated in the palio on Deep Space 3, according to &quot;Interface&quot;, a 1993 seventh season &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode.

Breen privateers attacked Free Haven, a Bajoran colony, in &quot;To the Death&quot;, a 1996 fourth season &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode.

A Breen appeared on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as a hologram enhanced by the Hirogen, in the seventh-season episode &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;.

The Breen function as a common recurring enemy for the Federation and the Klingon Empire in &quot;Star Trek: Online&quot;.

A Breen is one of the main characters in &quot;Star Trek: Renegades&quot;, a fan film posted to YouTube.

==Reception==
In June 2014, Charlie Jane Anders, writing for io9, ranked the Breen as the tenth least threatening villains of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, calling them &quot;one of the bigger letdowns of Star Trek&quot;. Anders cited how the race was built up as a supposedly formidable race, with an energy-dampening weapon that disabled enemy ships, only for the Federation to quickly devise a countermeasure to it, after which the Breen&#x27;s status as opponents faded.

<text>John Werner Kluge (; September 21, 1914September 7, 2010) was a German-American entrepreneur who became a television industry mogul in the United States. At one time he was the richest person in the U.S.

== Early life and education ==
Kluge was born to a Presbyterian family in Chemnitz, Germany, and emigrated to the United States in 1922. He earned his B.A. degree in economics from Columbia University in 1937. Prior to attending Columbia University, Kluge went to Wayne State University for two years. He was of Scots-Irish, English, and German heritage.

During World War II, Kluge served at the secret P.O. Box 1142 interrogation facility outside of Washington, D.C.

==Metromedia and Metromedia Company==
Kluge&#x27;s major move into media was by purchasing stock in the Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation in the mid-1950s. The Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation was the successor of the DuMont Television Network, which was spun off from DuMont Laboratories after the television network ceased operations in 1956. Metropolitan Broadcasting consisted of two stations, WABD in New York City and WTTG in Washington, D.C., both former DuMont outlets now operating as independent stations. Kluge joined the company as its board chairman and largest stockholder in 1958, acquiring the bulk of his shares from founder Allen B. DuMont for about USD $6,000,000.

After gaining control in 1959, Kluge began the company&#x27;s expansion further into broadcasting, with holdings in television and radio. In the early 1960s, Kluge bought an outdoor advertising firm, and in 1961 the company&#x27;s name was changed to Metromedia to reflect the diversity of its interests.

In 1986, Kluge sold the Metromedia television stations to 20th Century Fox (then controlled by News Corporation), for a reported US$4 billion. Those stations would later form the core of what would become the Fox television network, (spun off from News Corporation/20th Century Fox with Fox Corporation decades later) which launched on October 9 of that year. The following year, &quot;Forbes&quot; placed Kluge at the top of its list as the richest man in America.

In retaliation for a lawsuit brought by Paul Winchell, who sought the rights to his children&#x27;s television program, &quot;Winchell-Mahoney Time&quot;, Metromedia management, under orders from Kluge, destroyed the video tapes. Winchell was later awarded nearly $18 million as compensation for Metromedia&#x27;s capricious behavior.

Following the Fox disposal, Kluge&#x27;s activities had been carried out through a private venture named Metromedia Company in which he was a partner with Stuart Subotnick. Metromedia&#x27;s more recent activities have included Eastern European, Commonwealth of Independent States and China telecom/cable/radio ventures through Metromedia International Group and the ill-fated US telecom backbone operation Metromedia Fiber Network. In July 2008, the Metromedia Restaurant Group, part of the Metromedia Company, closed over 300 company-owned Bennigan&#x27;s and Steak and Ale restaurants. Kluge and partner Stuart Subotnick were also the original team operators of the New York/New Jersey MetroStars Major League Soccer franchise.

==Philanthropy==
===John W. Kluge Center===
In celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the Library of Congress, Kluge donated an unprecedented $60 million to create the John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. It was created as an academic center where accomplished senior scholars and junior post-doctoral fellows might gather to make use of the Library&#x27;s incomparable collections and to interact with members of the United States Congress. In addition, his gift would establish a $1 million prize to be given in recognition of a lifetime of achievement in the human sciences, comparable to the Nobel Prize in literature and economics. The Kluge Prize would honor lifetime intellectual achievement in the same way as the Kennedy Center Honors recognize lifetime achievement in the performing arts.

===Columbia University===
Kluge gave over $510 million to Columbia University. Acknowledging the scholarship funds that enabled him to attend, Kluge gave more than $110 million to Columbia University between 1987 and 1993, primarily to endow financial aid for undergraduates from underprivileged backgrounds. His donations also help many of these students pursue Ph.D.s after they graduate by financing their doctoral studies. On April 11, 2007, Columbia University&#x27;s President Lee C. Bollinger announced a $400 million pledge from Kluge, which the university was to receive upon the donor&#x27;s death. The donation marks the fourth largest gift to an institution of higher learning in America, all designated for financial aid. This marks the largest pledge ever devoted exclusively to student aid to any single institution of higher education in the United States.

===University of Virginia===
In December 1997, John Kluge gifted the bulk of his world-class collection of Aboriginal Australian art to the University of Virginia. The gift led the University of Virginia to found the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Museum, the only museum in the United States dedicated to the research and presentation of Aboriginal Australian art and culture.

In 2001, Kluge donated his estate in Albemarle County, Virginia to the University of Virginia. The estate, valued in excess of $45 million, was the largest gift in the university&#x27;s history. UVa has been holding classes and seminars in the various buildings and on the grounds of Morven Farm in an effort to incorporate the land grant into their various course offerings. Many developments are in the works to improve the farm and make it part of the landscape of Charlottesville.

In 2009 he donated $3 million to the university to foster end-of-life compassion.

===Political contributions===
Through the 1980s he gave donations to both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates and to Senate candidates in various states. In Virginia he mainly gave to Democrats. In 1986 he gave $75,000 to the state Democratic Leadership Council, and in 1989 he donated $100,000 to gubernatorial candidate L. Douglas Wilder.

==Personal life==
Kluge was a collector of contemporary Indigenous Australian art, and owned works by prominent artists including Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri.

In 1983, Kluge received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Kluge was married four times. His first wife was Theodora Thomson Townsend, his second was Yolanda Galardo Zucco, his third was Patricia Maureen Rose, and his fourth was Maria Tussi Kuttner. Patricia Kluge kept their Albemarle estate in the 1990 divorce settlement converting it into an award-winning vineyard and winery which opened in 1999. She took out $65 million in loans and mortgaged the mansion to finance production expansion and a related real-estate venture, but defaulted and declared bankruptcy in 2011. 
Kluge had three children, Joseph (whom he adopted), Samantha (with Zucco) and John Jr. (adopted, with Rose). He also had three step children who remained a part of his life until his death: Diane, Jeannette Brophy and Peter Lockwood Townsend. He had homes in New Rochelle, New York, Virginia and Palm Beach, Florida with his fourth wife, Maria Tussi Kluge, at the time of his death in 2010.

<doc id="255803" wikidata="Q11710297" url="?curid=255803" title="River Huntspill">
<text>The River Huntspill (or Huntspill River) is an artificial river, in the Somerset Levels, in the Sedgemoor district of Somerset, England. It was built in 1940 to supply process water to ROF Bridgwater, and has resulted in reduced flooding of the lower Brue Valley. Huntspill Sluice at the river&#x27;s western end, also known as West Huntspill Sluice, separates it from the River Parrett.

A large section of the river and its surrounding lands has been designated as a national nature reserve which is managed by the Environment Agency.

==History==
The concept for the Huntspill River was first suggested by J. Aubrey Clark in 1853, as a way of improving the drainage of the lower River Brue. Despite his vigorous support for the plan, no action was taken, largely due to the difficulties of getting the two divisions of the Court of Sewers, one responsible for the river system above Langport and the other for that below Langport, to agree on who was responsible and how such a scheme would be funded.

At the outbreak of World War II a new explosives factory, ROF Bridgwater, was proposed. This would need 4.5 million imperial gallons (20 Ml; 5.4M US gal) of process water per day. Louis Kelting, the Chief Engineer of the Somerset Catchment Board revived Clark&#x27;s plans, and combined the water supply solution with a drainage scheme. In addition to supplying water to the factory an area of was drained of which regularly flooded.

A straight channel was excavated using a dragline excavator during the early years of World War II. It was constructed as a priority war work, because of its importance to the munitions factory. The plans had been drawn up in late 1939, and by January 1940 the first excavations were being made.

It ran from Gold Corner, where it was connected to the South Drain, to a new outfall on the estuary of the River Parrett, and had retention sluices at both ends, so that it acted as a long reservoir. It was intended that in the summer, when water supply was lower, it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors; in winter as a drainage channel, via gravity drainage.

The plans were for a channel, with the excavated earth used to create flood banks at its edges. At this depth, water could flow into it from the moors by gravity, but problems were experienced with the design. Because the underlying soil was peat, the weight of the flood bank caused it to rotate and push upwards in the bottom of the channel. Experiments were carried out to find the optimum size for a stable channel, and the result was one that was only deep. The flood banks could not exceed in height, and had to be set back from the edge of the channel by at least . Because of the lack of depth, water from the South Drain had to be pumped into the river. The existing pumping station at Gold Corner could not cope with all the water from the drain, as well as flood water from the moors, so had to be enlarged.

Once the entire flow of the South Drain was entering the river, the section northwards from Gold Corner to the River Brue became redundant. Rather than allow it to silt up, it was enlarged, and Cripps sluice constructed where it met the Brue. This enabled water from the Brue, which had nowhere to go because its outlet was blocked by high tides, to be diverted southwards to the Huntspill river, with the result that flooding in the Brue valley was significantly reduced. The pumping station, with four Sultzer horizontal pumps which are powered by two-cylinder oil engines made by Crossley, has since been modernised including the conversion of one of the pumps to use electricity and replacing the fuel tanks.

Excavation of the channel cut through an area containing Roman salt works, the remains of which can be seen beside the river. The ground conditions made construction of bridges difficult, and required piles to be driven down to the underlying rock, some long, and one bridge requiring piles. The first of the pumps was operational by July 1942, and the pumping station was completed by the end of 1942. The total cost of the project was £411,594 (equivalent to £ in ), which included £35,000 for the construction of the new pumping station, and £26,000 to purchase the machinery fitted into it.

==Flora and fauna==
A stretch of the river, from Gold Corner to Huntspill Sluice (excluding the Cripps River), is a national nature reserve. The NNR is managed by the Environment Agency, rather than by Natural England, responsible for most of the other reserves in England. This arrangement is authorised by section 35 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and funding for the maintenance and upkeep of the river as a reserve is still provided by Natural England. The river and its catchment area include several Sites of Special Scientific Interest; of these, Street Heath, Shapwick Heath, and Westhay Heath are affected by water levels in the South Drain, while the water levels in Catcott, Edington and Chilton Moors SSSI are directly controlled by Gold Corner pumping station. This site has been designated because of the types of flowers found in its wet grasslands, the variety of wildlife found in its ditches, and its populations of wading birds, particularly lapwing, redshank and snipe.

The river discharges into the River Parrett just south of Highbridge. The Parrett flows into Bridgwater Bay, which is also an important national nature reserve,
on the edge of the Bristol Channel.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Huntspill River was as follows in 2019.

Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and mercury compounds, neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<doc id="255807" wikidata="Q740733" url="?curid=255807" title="Allan MacEachen">
<text>Allan Joseph MacEachen (; July 6, 1921 – September 12, 2017) was a Canadian politician and statesman who served as a senator and several times as a Cabinet minister. He was the first deputy prime minister of Canada and served from 1977 to 1979 and 1980 to 1984.

==Early life==
Born in Inverness on Nova Scotia&#x27;s Cape Breton Island, MacEachen graduated from St. Francis Xavier University, and lectured in economics for several years at the school. He was the son of Annie Gillies and Angus MacEachen, a coal miner from Inverness County, Nova Scotia. MacEachen&#x27;s maternal grandfather immigrated to Cape Breton Island from Morar, Scotland, in 1865. MacEachen&#x27;s parents both spoke the distinctive Nova Scotia dialect of Scottish Gaelic at home and MacEachen himself was a fluent speaker.

==Early political career==
MacEachen was elected for the first time to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1953 election as a Liberal under the leadership of Prime Minister Louis St-Laurent. MacEachen was re-elected in the 1957 election but was defeated in the Progressive Conservative Diefenbaker sweep in the 1958 election, the largest federal electoral victory in Canadian history.

MacEachen was re-elected to Parliament in the 1962 general election and again in the 1963, 1965, 1968, 1972, 1974, 1979, and 1980 elections.

==Cabinet minister==
When Lester B. Pearson formed a Liberal government in 1963, he appointed MacEachen to cabinet as Minister of Labour. It was the beginning of a lengthy career in cabinet in which MacEachen served in several portfolios under Prime Ministers Pearson, Pierre Trudeau and John Turner. Over the course of his career, MacEachen held the following portfolios: Labour, National Health and Welfare, Manpower and Immigration, Privy Council, External Affairs, and Finance.

In addition to his ministerial responsibilities, MacEachen served as Government House Leader on three occasions and became the first Deputy Prime Minister of Canada in 1977 under Trudeau, a post that was held whenever Trudeau was in office until the latter retired.

In his memoirs, published in 1993, Trudeau wrote that MacEachen &quot;had a very good strategic sense, both in and out of Parliament, and he lived and breathed politics.&quot; For Trudeau, he &quot;was always a source of shrewd advice&quot; and &quot;was the kind of man I respected, because he had no ulterior motives; he said what he thought, and the reasons he would give were always his real reasons.&quot;

In 1968 MacEachen contested the leadership of the Liberal Party but did not do well, largely because there was a second Nova Scotian on the ballot. He was courted to run for leader again in 1984 but opted to support John Turner, the eventual winner.

In 1979, when the Liberals lost the election to Joe Clark&#x27;s Conservatives, MacEachen served as interim Leader of the Opposition when Trudeau announced his retirement from politics. Trudeau&#x27;s short-lived retirement ended with the defeat of Clark&#x27;s government in a vote of confidence of his budget and the Liberals&#x27; return to power with a majority government on February 18, 1980.

MacEachen took the role of Finance Minister and announced the National Energy Policy as part of his 1980 budget. He also angered public sector unions in his 1982 budget by imposing a wage restraint package dubbed &quot;six and five,&quot; which limited wage increases to 6% and 5% for the next two years. That was while double-digit interest rates and inflation were common.

==Senator==
Turner, the new party leader and prime minister, recommended MacEachen for appointment to the Senate, where MacEachen became Leader of the Government in the Senate. MacEachen was in that position only briefly, as Turner lost the 1984 election, but MacEachen started the practice of allowing opposition senators to chair a number of committees, a practice that continues today.

From 1984 to 1991, he served as leader of the opposition in the Senate, where he was regarded as the primary opposition to the Conservative Brian Mulroney&#x27;s first term because of Mulroney&#x27;s substantial majority in the Commons, with an opposition that was spread nearly equally between Turner&#x27;s Liberals and Ed Broadbent&#x27;s New Democratic Party. In 1988, after a request by Turner, MacEachen blocked the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in the Senate to force an election before the issue was settled. The agreement was the main issue of the 1988 election. After Mulroney&#x27;s victory, MacEachen and the Senate passed the agreement.

After the election, MacEachen again used the Senate to block the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax. Mulroney recommended for appointment several new senators and used an emergency power in the Constitution Act, 1867, to allow him to recommend for appointment eight new senators. MacEachen then led a filibuster against the bill, with Liberal members defying Speaker Guy Charbonneau, who voted for Conservative motions. The Liberal senators used other tactics to delay Senate business. Soon, the motion was passed, and the Progressive Conservative majority passed new rules for the Senate to forbid such actions.

MacEachen retired from the Senate in 1996 after he had reached the mandatory retirement age of 75, and he became a dollar-per-year adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. Further controversy ensued in 1998, when it was discovered that he was still using a full Senate office.

==Retirement and death==
After leaving the Senate, MacEachen retired to Nova Scotia spending the rest of his life at his house on Lake Ainslie in Inverness County, Cape Breton and in Antigonish. In 2006, MacEachen endorsed Bob Rae&#x27;s candidacy to lead the Liberal Party, and was appointed honorary campaign chair of Rae&#x27;s campaign.

MacEachen died at the age of 96 on September 12, 2017, at St. Martha&#x27;s Hospital in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.

==Honours==
In 2008, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

St. Francis Xavier University holds the annual Allan J. MacEachen lecture in his honour. In 2000, the Allan J. MacEachen International Academic and Cultural Centre was opened in Mabou, Nova Scotia. The complex consists of a secondary school, Dalbrae Academy, and Strathspey Place, a performing arts centre. Dalhousie University&#x27;s MacEachen Institute for Public Policy and Governance is also named after him.

In 2021, Beaton Street, which is where MacEachen was raised in Inverness, Nova Scotia, was renamed Allan J. Memorial Avenue. The renaming coincided with the hundredth anniversary of MacEachen&#x27;s birth, and was widely celebrated by many in the small Cape Breton community. Project chair Ben MacKay remarked at the unveiling ceremony that “There is no better example to leave behind for my generation, and all future generations of young people in this country.”

<text>Mischief or malicious mischief is the name for a class of criminal offenses that is defined differently in different legal jurisdictions. While the wrongful acts will often involve what is popularly described as vandalism, there can be a legal differentiation between vandalism and mischief. The etymology of the word comes from Old French &quot;meschief&quot;, which means &quot;misfortune&quot;, from &quot;meschever&quot;, &quot;to end badly&quot;.

==Canada==
The country&#x27;s Criminal Code makes mischief a hybrid offence, punishable by up to and including life imprisonment if the mischief causes actual danger to human life. Public mischief is the term for the crime of wasting police time.

==Scotland==
Malicious mischief is an offence against the common law of Scotland. It does not require actual damage to property for the offence to be committed; financial damage consequential to the act is sufficient. It has now largely been replaced by vandalism, a statutory offense with the same definition. Vandalism is defined by section 52 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995.

==United States==
In United States criminal law, mischief is an offense against property that typically involves the intentional or reckless infliction of damage, defacement, , or of property. Common forms include vandalism and graffiti. Governed by state law, criminal mischief is committed when a perpetrator, having no right to do so nor any reasonable ground to believe that he/she has such a right, intentionally or recklessly damages property of another person, intentionally participates in the of property of another person, or participates in the reckless damage or destruction of property of another person.

<doc id="255811" wikidata="Q1366462" url="?curid=255811" title="Green Park tube station">
<text>Green Park is a London Underground station in Central London. It is located on the edge of Green Park, with entrances on both sides of Piccadilly. The station is served by three lines: Jubilee, Piccadilly and Victoria. On the Jubilee line the station is between Bond Street and Westminster stations, on the Piccadilly line it is between Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus stations, and on the Victoria line it is between Victoria and Oxford Circus stations. It is in fare zone 1.

The station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR) and was originally named &quot;Dover Street&quot; due to its location in that street. It was modernised in the 1930s when lifts were replaced with escalators and extended in the 1960s and 1970s when the Victoria and Jubilee lines were constructed.

The station is near The Ritz Hotel, the Royal Academy of Arts, St James&#x27;s Palace, Berkeley Square, Bond Street, the Burlington Arcade and Fortnum &amp; Mason, and is one of two stations serving Buckingham Palace (the other being St James&#x27;s Park).

==History==
===Piccadilly line===
====Rival schemes====
During the final years of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century numerous competing schemes for underground railways through central London were proposed. A number of the schemes submitted to parliament for approval as private bills included proposals for lines running under Piccadilly with stations in the area of the current Green Park station.

The first two proposals came before parliament in 1897. The Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&amp;PCR) proposed a line between South Kensington and Piccadilly Circus and the City and West End Railway (C&amp;WER) proposed a line between Hammersmith and Cannon Street. The B&amp;PCR proposed a station on the north side at Dover Street and the C&amp;WER proposed a station on the south side at Arlington Street. Following review by parliament, the C&amp;WER bill was rejected and the B&amp;PCR bill was approved and received royal assent in August 1897.

In 1902, the Charing Cross, Hammersmith and District Railway (CCH&amp;DR) proposed a line between Charing Cross and Barnes with a parallel shuttle line running between Hyde Park Corner and Charing Cross. A station was planned at Walsingham House on the north-east corner of Green Park. This scheme was rejected by parliament.

The same year, the Central London Railway (CLR, now the central section of the Central line) submitted a bill that aimed to turn its line running between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Bank into a loop by constructing a second roughly parallel line to the south. This would have run along Piccadilly with a station at St James&#x27;s Street just to the east of Dover Street. Delayed while a royal commission considered general principles of underground railways in London, the scheme was never fully considered and although it was re-presented in 1903, it was dropped two years later.

A third scheme for 1902 was the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway (PC&amp;NELR) which proposed a route between Hammersmith and Southgate. It planned a station at Albemarle Street, just to the east of Dover Street. Although favoured in parliament and likely to be approved, this scheme failed due to a falling-out between the backers and the sale of part of the proposals to a rival.

In 1905, some of the promoters of the PC&amp;NELR regrouped and submitted a proposal for the Hammersmith, City and North East London Railway. As the CLR had done previously, the company proposed a station at St James&#x27;s Street. Owing to failures in the application process, this scheme was also rejected.

====Construction and opening====
While the various rival schemes were unsuccessful in obtaining parliamentary approval, the B&amp;PCR was unsuccessful in raising the funds needed to construct its line. It was not until after the B&amp;PCR had been taken over by Charles Yerkes&#x27;s Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company that the money became available. Tunnelling began in 1902 shortly before the B&amp;PCR was merged with the Great Northern and Strand Railway to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR, the predecessor of the Piccadilly line).

The GNP&amp;BR opened the station on 15 December 1906 as &quot;Dover Street&quot;. As with most of the other GNP&amp;BR stations, the station building, on the east side of Dover Street, was designed by Leslie Green. It featured the company&#x27;s standard red glazed terracotta facade with wide semi-circular arches at first-floor level. Platform and passageway walls were decorated in glazed cream tiles in Green&#x27;s standard arrangement with margins, patterning and station names in mid-blue. When it opened, the station to the west was Down Street. The station was provided with four Otis electric lifts paired in two diameter shafts and a spiral stair in a smaller shaft. The platforms are below the level of Piccadilly.

====Reconstruction====
The station was busy and unsuccessful attempts to control crowds with gates at platform level were made in 1918. In the 1930s, the station was included amongst those modernised in conjunction with the northern and western extensions of the Piccadilly line. A new sub-surface ticket hall was opened on 18 September 1933 with a pair of Otis escalators provided to replace the lifts. The new ticket hall was accessed from subway entrances in Piccadilly. On the north side, an entrance was provided in Devonshire House on the corner with Stratton Street; on the south side an entrance was constructed on a piece of land taken from the park. The shelter for the southern entrance was designed by Charles Holden. The original station building, the lifts and the redundant below-ground passages were closed and the station was renamed &quot;Green Park&quot;. Part of the ground floor was used as a tea shop until the 1960s. In 1955, a third escalator was added to help deal with increased passenger numbers.

===Victoria line===

Proposals for an underground line linking Victoria to Finsbury Park date from 1937 when planning by the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) for future services considered a variety of new routes and extensions to existing lines. Parliament approved the line in 1955, but a shortage of funds meant that work did not start until after government loans were approved in 1962.

Construction works began in 1962. The 1930s ticket hall under the roadway of Piccadilly was enlarged to provide space for new Victoria line escalators and a long interchange passageway was provided between the Victoria line and Piccadilly line platforms. In 1965 a collapse of soft ground during the excavation of one of the tunnels near Green Park station meant that the ground had to be chemically stabilised before work could continue. The disused station building in Dover Street was demolished the following year in conjunction with the works for the new line. A vent shaft was constructed and an electrical sub-station was built in the basement of the new building. The 1930s entrance on the south side of Piccadilly was also reconstructed.

The enlarged ticket hall, new platforms and passageways were decorated in grey tiles. Platforms are approximately below street level. Platform roundel signs were on backlit illuminated panels. Seat recesses on the Victoria line platforms were tiled in an abstract pattern by Hans Unger of coloured circles representing a bird&#x27;s-eye view of trees in Green Park.

After trial running of empty trains from 24 February 1969, the Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969 with the opening of the third stage of the line between Warren Street and Victoria. The same day, Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the line by riding a train from Green Park to Oxford Circus.

===Jubilee line===

The origins of the Jubilee line are less clearly defined than those of the Victoria line. During World War II and throughout the 1950s and early 1960s consideration was given to various routes connecting north-west and south-east London via the West End and the City of London. Planning of the Victoria line had the greater priority and it was not until after construction of that line started that detailed planning began for the new line, first called the Fleet line in 1965 as it was planned to run in an east–west direction along Fleet Street. Lack of funding meant that only the first stage of the proposed line, from Baker Street to Charing Cross, received royal assent in July 1969; funding was agreed in August 1971.

Tunnelling began in February 1972 and was completed by the end of 1974. In 1977, during construction of the stations, the name of the line was changed to the Jubilee line, to mark the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee that year. A construction shaft in Hays Mews north of the station was used for an electrical substation and ventilation shaft. At Green Park, the ticket hall was enlarged slightly to provide space for escalators for the new line which connect to an intermediate concourse providing interchange between the Jubilee and Victoria lines. A second flight of escalators descends to the Jubilee line platforms, which are below street level, the deepest of the three sets. Interchange between the Jubilee and Piccadilly lines was via the ticket hall. Platform walls were tiled in a deep red with black leaf patterns by June Fraser. Trial running of trains began in August 1978 and the Jubilee line opened on 1 May the next year. The line had been officially opened by Prince Charles the previous day, starting with a train journey from Green Park to Charing Cross. In 1993, to alleviate congestion, a third escalator was installed in the lower flight to replace a fixed staircase.
Work on the Fleet line&#x27;s stages 2 and 3 did not proceed and it was not until 1992 that an alternative route was approved. The Jubilee line extension took the line south of the River Thames via Waterloo, which was impractical to reach from the line&#x27;s existing terminus at Charing Cross. New tunnels branching from the original route south of Green Park were constructed, and the line to Charing Cross was closed. Tunnelling began in May 1994, and improvements were carried out at Green Park to provide a direct passageway connection between the Jubilee and Piccadilly lines, including lifts to the platforms at each end. A new ventilation shaft and an emergency exit to Arlington Street were built. The new extension opened in stages starting at Stratford in the east, with services to Charing Cross ending on 19 November 1999 and the final section between Green Park and Waterloo opening the following day.

===Recent changes===

In 2008, Transport for London (TfL) announced a project to provide step-free access to all three lines in advance of the 2012 London Olympics. The project also included the construction of a new entrance on the south side of Piccadilly with ramped access directly from Green Park designed by Capita Symonds and Alacanthus LW architects. Work commenced in May 2009 to install two lifts from the ticket hall to the Victoria line platforms and the interchange passageway to the Piccadilly line. This work and a third lift in the new park-side entrance between the street level and the ticket hall were completed ahead of schedule in 2011. At the same time, Green Park station underwent a major improvement programme which saw the tiling on the Victoria and Piccadilly line platforms and the interchange passageways replaced. When the Jubilee line opened, the Hans Unger tiling in the seat recesses of the Victoria line platforms was replaced with a design using the leaf patterns used on the Jubilee line platforms; the Unger design was reinstated during the restoration.
The new park entrance and street level shelter feature artwork within the Portland stone cladding titled &quot;Sea Strata&quot; designed by John Maine RA. The &quot;Diana Fountain&quot; was relocated from its original site in the centre of the park to form the centrepiece of the new entrance.

To help moderate temperatures in the station, a system using cool ground water extracted from boreholes sunk into the chalk aquifer below London was installed. The extracted water passes through a heat exchanger connected to the cast-iron tunnel lining and the warmed water is returned to the aquifer through a second set of boreholes away.

==Proposal for new connection==
In July 2005, a report, &quot;DLR Horizon 2020 Study&quot;, for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) examined &quot;pragmatic development schemes&quot; to expand and improve the DLR network between 2012 and 2020. One of the proposals was an extension of the DLR from Bank to Charing Cross. Unused tunnels under Strand constructed as part of Stage 1 of the Fleet line would be enlarged to accommodate the larger DLR trains. In 2011, the DLR published a proposal to continue the extension to Victoria via Green Park. No further work has been done on these proposals.

==Piccadilly bombing==

At around 9:00 pm on 9 October 1975, members of the Provisional IRA&#x27;s Balcombe Street Gang detonated a bomb at a bus stop outside Green Park station, killing 23-year-old Graham Ronald Tuck and injuring 20 others. The attack was part of a bombing campaign carried out by the gang and in addition to the death and injuries caused damage to the Ritz Hotel and neighbouring buildings.

==Services and connections==
===Services===
Green Park station is on the Jubilee, Piccadilly and Victoria lines in London fare zone 1.

As of it is the station on the London Underground with million passengers using it per year.

===Connections===
London Buses day and night routes serve the station.

== In popular culture ==
The opening scene of the 1997 film version of Henry James&#x27;s &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; was set on the eastbound platforms at both Dover Street and Knightsbridge stations, both represented by the same studio mock-up, complete with a working recreation of a 1906 Stock train.

<text>Sorsogon, officially the Province of Sorsogon (Bikol: &quot;Probinsya kan Sorsogon&quot;; Waray: &quot;Probinsya han Sorsogon&quot;; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Bicol Region. It is the southernmost province in the island of Luzon and is subdivided into fourteen municipalities (towns) and one city. Its capital (and largest city) is Sorsogon City (formerly the towns of &quot;Sorsogon&quot; and &quot;Bacon&quot;) and borders the province of Albay to the north.

Sorsogon is at the tip of the Bicol Peninsula and faces the island of Samar to the southeast across the San Bernardino Strait and Ticao Island to the southwest. &quot;Sorsoganons&quot; is how the people of Sorsogon call themselves.

== History ==
===Spanish colonial era===
In 1570 two Augustinian friars, Alonzon Jiménez and Juan Orta, accompanied by a certain captain, Enrique de Guzmán, reached &quot;Hibalong&quot;, a small fishing village near the mouth of Ginangra River, and planted the cross and erected the first chapel in Luzon. It was from this village that Ibalong, referring to the whole region, came to be. Moving inland with a northwesterly direction they passed by the territory now known as Pilar, before they reached Camalig, Albay. The establishment of the Abucay-Catamlangan Mission later was ample proof of this. The early towns established here were: &quot;Gibalon&quot; in 1570 (now sitio of Magallanes); Casiguran – 1600; Bulusan – 1631; Pilar – 1635; Donsol – 1668; Bacon - 1754; Gubat - 1764; Juban and Matnog – 1800; Bulan – 1801; Castilla – 1827; Magallanes – 1860; Sorsogon – 1866 and Irosin – 1880. The province was eventually separated from Albay on October 17, 1894, and adopted the name &quot;Sorsogon&quot;. The town of Sorsogon was also selected as its capital.

===American invasion era===
At the 1935 Philippine Constitutional Convention, Sorsogon had its own delegates. They were Adolfo Grafilo, Francisco Arellano, José S. Reyes, and Mario Gaurino.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===

The Philippines&#x27; gradual postwar recovery took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis being one of the early landmark events. Economic analysts generally attribute this to the ramp-up on loan-funded government spending to promote Ferdinand Marcos’ 1969 reelection campaign, The next two and a half years were fraught with social conflicts as various sectors went to the streets to express their dissastisfaction with policies that fostered widespread poverty. In 1972, one year before the expected end of his last constitutionally allowed term as president in 1973, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law. This allowed Marcos to remain in power for fourteen more years, during which Sorsogon went through many social and economic ups and downs. Labor unions and protest actions were banned, media outlets were shuttered, the legislature was shuttered, and freedom of expression was generally suppressed. Those who expressed opinions which criticized the government or its policies were accused of being communists and arrested without warrant. 

During this time, many citizens of Sorsogon joined the effort to resist the erosion of democracy, and many of them became political detainees, or were tortured and killed by the dictatorship&#x27;s forces. Among the more prominent of them were local figures Ma. Antonia Teresa “Nanette” Vytiaco, Tony Ariado, Ceasar Gavanzo Jr., and Manuel Dorotan, as well as figures like Liliosa Hilao and Juan Escandor, who were killed in Manila. Vytiaco, Ariado, Gavanzo, Dorotan, Hilao, and Escandor have all since been honored by having their names inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes who fought against the authoritarian regime.

===Contemporary===
In 2000, Sorsogon City was created through the merging of the municipalities of Bacon and Sorsogon.

==Geography==

Sorsogon covers a total area of occupying the southeastern tip of the Bicol Peninsula in Luzon. The province is bordered on the north by Albay, east by the Philippine Sea, south by the San Bernardino Strait, and west and northwest by the Ticao and Burias Passes. The Sorsogon Bay lies within the central portion of the province.

The province has an irregular topography. Except for landlocked Irosin, all the towns lie along the coast. They are all connected by concrete and asphalt roads. Mountain&#x27;s sprawl over the northeast, southeast and west portions. Mount Bulusan, the tallest peak, rises above sea level.

Except for its overland link with the province of Albay to the north, it is completely surrounded by water. Sorsogon is the gateway of Luzon to the Visayas through its Roll-on/Roll-off ferry terminal facilities located in the municipalities of Matnog, Pilar and Bulan.
===Administrative divisions===
Sorsogon comprises 14 municipalities and 1 city.



===Climate===
Sorsogon belongs to Type 2 climate based on the Climate Map of the Philippines by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Being a Type 2, Sorsogon has No dry season with a pronounced rainfall from November to January.


The province of Sorsogon normally gets 5 to 10 typhoons every year.

The most notable typhoon is in 1987, when Sorsogon was devastated by Super Typhoon Nina named &quot;Sisang&quot;. It was a major disaster in the Province of Sorsogon. Damages in properties cost millions of pesos and killing 200 people. It is said that Sisang is the strongest typhoon that hit the province, especially its capital, Sorsogon City. According to PAGASA, Typhoon Nina ravaged with a wind of and a gustiness of . Thousands of houses plus business establishments were destroyed by the said natural calamity. Typhoon Sisang hit the Sorsogon soil at around 7:00 pm and it last until dawn of the next day. It also caused massive storm surges particularly around the Sorsogon Bay area which contributed to the many fatalities during the battering of the typhoon.

Typhoon Xangsane (&quot;Milenyo&quot;) also battered the province in September 2006 with torrential rains and strong winds. It caused massive flooding and caused infrastructure and agricultural damages. Damages to the entire province was initially placed at 2.23 billion, of which 1.27 billion was accounted for by damaged houses. Agriculture suffered damage worth 234.21 million; school facilities, 51 million and infrastructure, 208 million.

==Demographics==
===Population===
The population of Sorsogon in the 2020 census was 828,655 people, with a density of .

The top 5 towns with the greatest number of populations is Sorsogon City (168,110), Bulan (100,076), Pilar (74,564), Gubat (59,534), and Castilla (57,827). The least populated municipality since the 2000 census is Santa Magdalena.

Of the 704,024-household population in 2007, males accounted for 51.1% and while females comprised 48.9%.

The voting-age population of the province was 369,204 in 2007, equivalent to 52.1 percent of the household population.

===Languages===

The Bicolano language is predominantly used in Sorsogon as the language used by its people. Despite this, &quot;Bicolano&quot; itself, as used in the province, has many peculiarities. What is known as &quot;&quot;Bikol Naga&quot; is generally used in written communications and generally understood there as a spoken language. However, the people who live in the southernmost parts of Sorsogon like Gubat speak the Waray language. In either case, English and Filipino are the official languages used in education and government communication.

The Bikol languages are peculiar in some localities. For example, people in Bacon, Prieto Diaz and Magallanes speak the &quot;Albay Bikol&quot; variant. In Sorsogon City, Casiguran and Juban, Bicolano is different for some terms being used there, which have similarity to the Hiligaynon language (the language spoken in Western Visayas and southwestern Masbate).

In Barcelona, Gubat, Bulusan, Matnog, Irosin and Santa Magdalena, a dialect is spoken in which terms and tones are similar to the Waray language of Eastern Visayas (particularly in Northern Samar) called Waray Sorsogon language. The people of Pilar and Donsol speak a dialect which is similar, but not exactly, to the &quot;Miraya Bicol&quot;&quot; or the dialect spoken by the nearby towns of Camalig and Daraga in Albay province. The &quot;Castilla&quot; dialect, although distinct, has a similarity to that which is spoken in Daraga.

====Sorsogon Ayta Language====
In 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the &quot;Southern Ayta (Sorsogon Ayta)&quot; language which has an estimated speaker of 150 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot;, meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Sorsogon Ayta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.

The Sorsogon Ayta people live only on the municipality of Prieto Diaz, Sorsogon. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.

===Religion===

Sorsogon is predominantly a Catholic province. Spanish &quot;conquistadores&quot; gave Sorsogon its first encounter with Christianity. This was in the year 1569 when Fray Alonzo Jimenez, OSA, chaplain of the expedition under Luis Enriquez de Guzman celebrated the first Mass upon landing on the coast of sitio Gibal-ong (or Gibalon), barangay Siuton, in the town of Magallanes. Christianity, however, was formally established in Sorsogon with the planting of the Cross on the shores of Casiguran town in 1600 by the Franciscan Friars. This was a prelude to the erection of the first church building dedicated to the Holy Rosary, still revered at present as the Patroness of Casiguran. From there, the Franciscan missionaries devotedly spread the faith to the other towns in Bacon (1617), Bulusan (1630) and Donsol (1668). The other twelve towns followed suit in the course of time. In the original geographic division, the province of Sorsogon formed part of Albay province. It seceded as a separate province on October 17, 1984. Catholicism is followed by 93% of the population of Sorsogon.

The Diocese of Sorsogon was originally part of the Archdiocese of Nueva Caceres. When it was made a separate diocese on June 29, 1951, it included the territory of Masbate. When the Diocese of Nueva Caceres was elevated into an archdiocese in the same year, Legazpi and Sorsogon were made suffragan dioceses of Nueva Caceres. On March 23, 1968, Masbate was made into a separate diocese. At present the Diocese of Sorsogon covers simply the civil province of Sorsogon and the City of Sorsogon with the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Sorsogon City as its seat.

The Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church Of Christ) has the minority of this province each town has 2-3 locale chapels built, the whole province comprised 71 locale, and barangay chapels.

== Superstitions and local legends and beliefs ==
Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities. These deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which an Aswang (local version of witches and monsters) and, his brother was trying to steal. Whenever people disobey his orders, wishes and commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways. Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.; Asuang, the evil god who always tries to steal the sacred fire of Mount Mayon from his brother, Gugurang. Addressed sometimes as Aswang, he dwells mainly inside Mount Malinao. As an evil god, he would cause the people to suffer misfortunes and commit sins. Enemy of Gugurang and a friend of Bulan the god of the Moon; Haliya, the masked goddess of the moonlight and the archenemy of Bakunawa and protector of Bulan. Her cult is composed primarily of women. There is also a ritual dance named after her as it is performed to be a countermeasure against Bakunawa.; &quot;Bulan&quot;, the god of the pale moon, he is depicted as a pubescent boy with uncommon comeliness that made savage beast and the vicious mermaids (Magindara) tame. He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang&#x27;s grip; &quot;Magindang&quot;, the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the Moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately; &quot;Okot&quot;, god of forest and hunting; and &quot;Bakunawa&quot;, a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the Sun and the Noon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa&#x27;s main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.

<text>Thomas Tallis (; also Tallys or Talles; 23 November 1585) was an English composer of High Renaissance music. His compositions are primarily vocal, and he occupies a primary place in anthologies of English choral music. Tallis is considered one of England&#x27;s greatest composers, and is honoured for his original voice in English musicianship.

==Life==
===Youth===
As no records about the birth, family or childhood of Thomas Tallis exist, almost nothing is known about his early life or origins. Historians have calculated that he was born in the early part of the 16th century, towards the end of the reign of Henry VII of England, and estimates for the year of his birth range from 1500 to 1520. His only known relative was a cousin called John Sayer. As the surnames &quot;Sayer&quot; and &quot;Tallis&quot; both have strong connections with Kent, Thomas Tallis is usually thought to have been born somewhere in the county. 

There are suggestions that Tallis sang as a child of the chapel in the Chapel Royal, the same singing establishment which he joined as an adult.{{sfn|Walker|1907|p=34}}{{sfn|Lord|2003|p=80}} He was probably a chorister at the Benedictine Priory of St. Mary the Virgin and St. Martin of the New Work, in Dover, where he was employed at an early age, but it is impossible to know whether he was educated there. He may have sung at Canterbury Cathedral.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=2}}

===Career===
Tallis served at court as a composer and performer for Henry VIII,{{sfn|Holman|1999|p=201}} Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I.{{sfn|Thomas|1998|p=136}} He was first designated as an organist at the chapel after 1570, although he would have been employed as an organist throughout his career.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}} 

He avoided the religious controversies that raged around him throughout his service to successive monarchs, though he remained, in the words of the historian Peter Ackroyd, an &quot;unreformed Roman Catholic&quot;.{{sfn|Ackroyd|2004|p=176}} Tallis was capable of switching the style of his compositions to suit each monarch&#x27;s different demands.{{sfn|Phillips|2005|p=8}} He stood out among other important composers of the time, including Christopher Tye and Robert White. The author and composer Ernest Walker wrote that &quot;he had more versatility of style&quot; than Tye and White, and &quot;his general handling of his material was more consistently easy and certain&quot;.{{sfn|Walker|1907|p=44}} Tallis taught the composer William Byrd, as later associated with Lincoln Cathedral; as also Elway Bevin, an organist of Bristol Cathedral and Gentleman of the Chapel Royal.{{sfn|Walker|1907|p=56}}

====1530s and 1540s====
No record of Tallis exists before 1531, when he is named in the accounts of the Kent Benedictine house Dover Priory.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=2}} He was employed there as the organist,{{sfn|Lord|2003|p=197}} responsible for directing chants from the organ{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=4}} A &quot;Thomas Tales&quot; is named as the &quot;joculator organorum&quot; at the priory and received an annual payment of £2.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}} The priory was dissolved in 1535, but there is no surviving record of Tallis&#x27;s departure.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=5}}{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}}

Tallis&#x27;s whereabouts are not known for the several months after this until mention is made of his being employed at St Mary-at-Hill in London&#x27;s Billingsgate ward.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=5}} Records show he was paid four half-yearly payments from 1536 to 1538, with the last payment being specified for services—as either a singer or an organist—for the year up to 25 March 1538.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}}{{sfn|Harley|2015|pp=5{{ndash}}6}}
Towards the end of 1538 Tallis moved to a large Augustinian monastery, Waltham Abbey in Essex,{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=7}} after he had come into contact with the abbot, whose London home was near to St Mary-at-Hill.{{sfn|Milsom|2008}} At Waltham, Tallis became a senior member.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=7}} When the abbey, too, was dissolved in March 1540, Tallis left without receiving a pension (since he had only recently been employed there), and was instead given a one-off payment of 40 shillings. He took away a volume of musical treatises copied by John Wylde, once a preceptor at Waltham. Among its contents was a treatise by Leonel Power that prohibited consecutive unisons, fifths, and octaves; the last page is inscribed with his name.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}}{{sfn|Walker|1907|p=34}}

By the summer of 1540 Tallis had moved to the formerly monastic but recently secularised Canterbury Cathedral, where his name heads the list of singers in the newly expanded choir of 10 boys and 12 men. He remained there for two years.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=7}}{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}}

====Employment at the Chapel Royal====
Tallis&#x27;s employment in the Chapel Royal probably began in 1543. His name appears on a 1544 lay subsidy roll and is listed in a later document. It is possible that he was connected with the court when at St Mary-at-Hill, since in 1577 Tallis claimed to have &quot;served yo[u]r Ma[jes]tie and yo[u]r Royall ancestors these fortie yeres&quot;. He may have been responsible for teaching the boys of the choir keyboard and composition.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}}

Around 1552, Tallis married, probably for the first time, to Joan the widow of a gentleman of the Chapel Royal. Like many other members of the royal household choir, Tallis and his wife lived in Greenwich,{{sfn|Milsom|2008}} although it is not known if he ever owned his house there. He probably rented a house, by tradition in Stockwell Street.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}} There seem to have been no children of the marriage.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}}

Queen Mary I granted Tallis a lease on a manor in Kent which provided a comfortable annual income.{{sfn|Cole|2008b|p=93}} He was present at her funeral on 13 December 1558 and at the coronation of Elizabeth I the following month.{{sfn|Milsom|2008}}
Tallis was an eminent figure in Elizabeth&#x27;s household chapel, but as he aged he became gradually less prominent.{{sfn|Milsom|2008}} In 1575, Elizabeth granted Tallis and Byrd a 21-year monopoly for polyphonic music{{sfn|Holman|1999|p=1}} and a patent to print and publish &quot;set songe or songes in parts&quot;, one of the first arrangements of its kind in England.{{sfn|Lord|2003|p=69}} Tallis composed in English, Latin, French, Italian, and other languages.{{sfn|Holman|1999|p=1}} He had exclusive rights to print any music in any language, and he and Byrd had sole use of the paper used in printing music. Amongst the collection of works they produced using their monopoly was the 1575 &quot;Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur&quot;, but it did not sell well and they were forced to appeal to Elizabeth for support.{{sfn|Holman|1999|p=1}} People were wary of the new publications, the sale of which was not helped by both men being Roman Catholics.{{sfn|Lord|2003|p=69}} As Catholics, Byrd and Tallis were forbidden to sell imported music, and were refused any rights to music fonts, or printing patents not under their command. They lacked their own printing press.{{sfn|Lord|2003|p=70}} A second petition in 1577 resulted in the grant of a joint lease of crown lands to the two composers.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}} After the 1575 publication, Tallis is thought to have ceased active composition, as no works from these final years survive.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=1}}

===Final years===
Late in his life, Tallis lived in Greenwich, possibly close to the royal Palace of Placentia; tradition holds that he lived on Stockwell Street.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}} He was recorded as a member of Elizabeth I&#x27;s household in June 1585, and wrote his will in August that year.{{sfn|Harley|2015|pp=211–212}} He died in his house in Greenwich on 20 or 23 November; the different dates are from a register and the Chapel Royal.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=212}}{{sfn|Rimbault|1872|p=192}} 

He was buried in the chancel of St Alfege Church, Greenwich.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=212}} A brass memorial plate placed there after the death of his wife (but before the death of Elizabeth (ONDB)){{clarify|date=March 2021}} is now lost.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=212}} His remains may have been discarded by labourers during the 1710s, when the church was rebuilt.{{sfn|Downes|1987|pp=110–111}}

His epitaph on a brass plaque, lost in the subsequent rebuilding of the church, was recorded by the English clergyman John Strype in his 1720 edition of John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot;{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}}{{sfn|Rimbault|1872|pp=192–193}}

&lt;poem&gt;Entered here doth ly a worthy wyght,
Who for long tyme in musick bore the bell:
His name to shew, was THOMAS TALLYS hyght,
In honest virtuous lyff he dyd excell.

He serv&#x27;d long tyme in chappel with grete prayse
Fower sovereygnes reygnes (a thing not often seen);
I meane Kyng Henry and Prynce Edward&#x27;s dayes,
Quene Mary, and Elizabeth oure Quene.

He mary&#x27;d was, though children he had none,
And lyv&#x27;d in love full thre and thirty yeres
Wyth loyal spowse, whose name yclypt was JONE,
Who here entomb&#x27;d him company now beares.

As he dyd lyve, so also did he dy,
In myld and quyet sort (O happy man!)
To God ful oft for mercy did he cry,
Wherefore he lyves, let deth do what he can.&lt;/poem&gt;

On learning of Tallis&#x27;s death, William Byrd wrote &quot;Ye Sacred Muses&quot;, his musical elegy to his colleague and mentor. Tallis&#x27;s widow Joan, whose will is dated 12 June 1587, survived him by nearly four years.{{sfn|Doe|Allinson|2009}}{{sfn|Milsom|2008}}

==Works==
{{See|List of compositions by Thomas Tallis}}

===Early works===
The earliest surviving works by Tallis are &quot;Ave Dei patris filia&quot;, &quot;Magnificat for four voices&quot;,{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=224}} and two devotional antiphons to the Virgin Mary, &quot;Salve intemerata virgo&quot; and &quot;Ave rosa sine spinis&quot;, which were sung in the evening after the last service of the day; they were cultivated in England at least until the early 1540s. Henry VIII&#x27;s break from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 and the rise of Thomas Cranmer noticeably influenced the style of music being written. Cranmer recommended a syllabic style of music where each syllable is sung to one pitch, as his instructions make clear for the setting of the 1544 &quot;English Litany&quot;.{{sfn|Willis|2016|p=52}} As a result, the writing of Tallis and his contemporaries became less florid. Tallis&#x27; &quot;Mass for Four Voices&quot; is marked with a syllabic and chordal style emphasising chords, and a diminished use of melisma. He provides a rhythmic variety and differentiation of moods depending on the meaning of his texts.{{sfn|Manderson|2000|p=86}} Tallis&#x27; early works also suggest the influence of John Taverner and Robert Fayrfax.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=222}} Taverner in particular is quoted in &quot;Salve intemerata virgo&quot;, and his later work, &quot;Dum transisset sabbatum&quot;.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=222}}

The reformed Anglican liturgy was inaugurated during the short reign of Edward VI (1547–53),{{sfn|Lord|2003|p=75}} and Tallis was one of the first church musicians to write anthems set to English words, although Latin continued to be used alongside the vernacular.{{sfn|Lord|2003|p=200}} Queen Mary set about undoing some of the religious reforms of the preceding decades, following her accession in 1553. She restored the Sarum Rite, and compositional style reverted to the elaborate writing prevalent early in the century.{{sfn|Shrock|2009|p=148}} Two of Tallis&#x27;s major works were &quot;Gaude gloriosa Dei Mater&quot; and the Christmas Mass &quot;Puer natus est nobis&quot;, and both are believed to be from this period. &quot;Puer natus est nobis&quot; based on the introit for the third Mass for Christmas Day may have been sung at Christmas 1554 when Mary believed that she was pregnant with a male heir.{{sfn|Milsom|2008}} These pieces were intended to exalt the image of the Queen, as well as to praise the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Shrock|2009|p=148}}

Some of Tallis&#x27;s works were compiled by Thomas Mulliner in a manuscript copybook called &quot;The Mulliner Book&quot; before Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, and may have been used by the queen herself when she was younger. Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister in 1558, and the Act of Uniformity abolished the Roman Liturgy{{sfn|Farrell|2001|p=125}} and firmly established the Book of Common Prayer.{{sfn|Thomas|1998|p=89}} Composers resumed writing English anthems, although the practice continued of setting Latin texts among composers employed by Elizabeth&#x27;s Chapel Royal.

The religious authorities at the beginning of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, being Protestant, tended to discourage polyphony in church unless the words were clearly audible or, as the 1559 Injunctions stated, &quot;playnelye understanded, as if it were read without singing&quot;.{{sfn|Willis|2016|p=57}} Tallis wrote nine psalm chant tunes for four voices for Archbishop Matthew Parker&#x27;s Psalter published in 1567.{{sfn|Lord|2003|p=86}} One of the nine tunes was the &quot;Third Mode Melody&quot; which inspired the composition of &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot; by Ralph Vaughan Williams in 1910.{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=291}} Another of the tunes, a setting of Psalm 67, became known as &quot;Tallis&#x27;s Canon&quot;. A version of it published by Thomas Ravenscroft was used as the tune for Thomas Ken&#x27;s hymn &quot;All praise to thee, my God, this night&quot;, and it has become his best-known composition. The Injunctions, however, also allowed a more elaborate piece of music to be sung in church at certain times of the day,{{sfn|Willis|2016|p=57}} and many of Tallis&#x27;s more complex Elizabethan anthems may have been sung in this context, or alternatively by the many families that sang sacred polyphony at home.{{sfn|Milsom|2003|p=163}} Tallis&#x27;s better-known works from the Elizabethan years include his settings of the &quot;Lamentations (of Jeremiah the Prophet)&quot;{{sfn|Cole|2008b|p=93}} for the Holy Week services and the unique motet &quot;Spem in alium&quot; written for eight five-voice choirs, for which he is most remembered. He also produced compositions for other monarchs, and several of his anthems written in Edward&#x27;s reign are judged to be on the same level as his Elizabethan works, such as &quot;If Ye Love Me&quot;.{{sfn|Phillips|2005|p=11}} Records are incomplete on his works from previous periods; 11 of his 18 Latin-texted pieces from Elizabeth&#x27;s reign were published, &quot;which ensured their survival in a way not available to the earlier material&quot;.{{sfn|Phillips|2005|p=13}}

===Later works===
Toward the end of his life, Tallis resisted the musical development seen in his younger contemporaries such as Byrd, who embraced compositional complexity and adopted texts of disparate biblical extracts.{{sfn|Phillips|2005|p=9}} Tallis was content to draw his texts from the Liturgy{{sfn|Farrell|2001|p=125}} and wrote for the worship services in the Chapel Royal.{{sfn|Farrell|2001|p=125}} He composed during the conflict between Catholicism and Protestantism, and his music often displays characteristics of the turmoil.{{sfn|Gatens|2005|p=181}}

==Legacy==

Tallis is remembered as primarily a composer of sacred vocal music, in part because of his lack of extant instrumental or secular vocal music.{{sfn|Harley|2015|p=227}} 

No contemporaneous portrait of Tallis survives; the one painted by Gerard Vandergucht dates from 150 years after the composer&#x27;s death, and there is no reason to suppose that it is a fair likeness. In a rare existing copy of his blackletter signature, he spelled his name &quot;Tallys&quot;.{{sfn|Cole|2008b|p=62}}

In 1971, the Thomas Tallis School in Kidbrooke opened, a mixed comprehensive school named after the composer.

A fictionalised version of Thomas Tallis was portrayed by Joe Van Moyland in the 2007 Showtime television series &quot;The Tudors&quot;.
