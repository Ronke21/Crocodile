<text>IRCAM (French: &quot;Ircam, &quot;, English: Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music) is a French institute dedicated to the research of music and sound, especially in the fields of avant garde and electro-acoustical art music. It is situated next to, and is organisationally linked with, the Centre Pompidou in Paris. The extension of the building was designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers. Much of the institute is located underground, beneath the fountain to the east of the buildings.

==A centre for musical research==

Several concepts for electronic music and audio processing have emerged at IRCAM. John Chowning pioneered work on FM synthesis at IRCAM, and Miller Puckette originally wrote Max at IRCAM in the mid-1980s, which would become the real-time audio processing graphical programming environment Max/MSP. Max/MSP has subsequently become a widely used tool in electroacoustic music. Many of the techniques associated with spectralism, such as analyses based on fast Fourier transforms, were made practical by technological contributions at IRCAM. For instance, researchers at IRCAM have developed a special microphone capable of isolating each of the cello&#x27;s four strings for separate amplification or electronic treatment. Along with tools for sound synthesis and analysis, IRCAM has played an instrumental role in developing programs for visualization of musical form with the creation of OpenMusic, a Lisp-based visual programming language.

IRCAM provides classes to train composers in music technology. Composers who do not have programming experience to create the technology end of a piece for ensemble and electronics are provided with an assistant who helps them to realise technically intensive parts of the piece. The assistant will follow the conceptual advice of a composer with no technology experience to realize a computer part, or will help a composer who can program in Max/MSP to make their &quot;patch&quot; more efficient and elegant. Tristan Murail&#x27;s &quot;Désintégrations&quot; is an example of a piece realized in this program by a composer with significant technological skill, whereas Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s &quot;The Mask of Orpheus&quot; required an active and creative role for the technology assistants, such as Barry Anderson and Ian Dearden.

==A cultural centre for musical modernism==

Apart from electroacoustic programmes, IRCAM has programmes in contemporary classical music. It has disseminated music of post World War II modernist musicians such as that of Luciano Berio or Pierre Boulez, as well as younger performers and composers. Musical spectralism such as that of Tristan Murail, has also received support from IRCAM. Murail taught at IRCAM for a time. Kaija Saariaho, whose work has been influenced by spectralism, has also been supported by IRCAM.

IRCAM has also helped to develop various performance models. A resident ensemble of IRCAM, Ensemble InterContemporain, specialised in contemporary classical music, where each performer could be called upon to perform solo literature or ensemble literature. The Ensemble InterContemporain has been a model for many large ensembles in Europe, for example the Ensemble Modern and Klangforum Wien. Many classical contemporary pieces have been written for the chamber orchestra section of Ensemble InterContemporain.

There are regular concerts at IRCAM.

==History==
In 1970 President Georges Pompidou asked Pierre Boulez to found an institution for research in music. In 1973 the section of the building underneath was finished, and IRCAM opened in 1977. From the outset, Boulez was in charge of the institute. The initial administrators included Luciano Berio, Vinko Globokar, Jean-Claude Risset, and Max Mathews. 1990 Ircam established the Cursus Program for young Composers, a training in Computer Music and Composition. In 1992 Boulez, who then became honorary director, was succeeded by . In 2002 the philosopher Bernard Stiegler became the new head of the institute. On 1 January 2006, Stiegler became Director of Cultural Development at the Centre Pompidou and was replaced by .

The creation of IRCAM coincided with the rise of the debates about modernism and postmodernism in culture and the arts.

Its multimedia library was established in 1996. It is one of the first music hybrid libraries to have been created with close to 1000 hours of recorded music and over 2,000 scientific articles available online, in addition to its physical collections of sheet music and books on music and related domains.

Several international conferences have been held at IRCAM:
* ICMC, the yearly International Computer Music Conference, in 1984
* ISMIR 2002, the 3rd international conference on music information retrieval, in October 2002
* NIME-06, the 6th International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, in June 2006
* Acanthes, a yearly summer festival and series of composition workshops started in 2012

===Software developed at IRCAM===
Some software is being developed at IRCAM, such as OpenMusic, AudioSculpt, OMax, Spat, Modalys, Antescofo and Orchidée.

Orchidée is developed as a tool to aid in orchestral composition in which musical scores using traditional instruments are generated by imitating a target input sound. It is used in Jonathan Harvey&#x27;s 2008 piece, &quot;Speakings&quot;, a composition based on emulating speech patterns and inflections. Orchidée is capable of computing the complex combinatorial possibilities of an orchestra based on &quot;musical attributes&quot; such as dynamics and instruments, &quot;perceptual attributes&quot; such as brightness, and &quot;timbre models&quot;.

IRCAM software is distributed via a subscription-based Forum. As of 2011, IRCAM Forum has 534 members including individual artists and art institutions around the world. IRCAM Forum members gather yearly at IRCAM for workshops regarding new technologies developed at IRCAM and elsewhere. IRCAM has also created a music file format, codice_1.

There are also partnerships with companies such as Cycling 74 (Max/MSP) and Flux:: (IRCAM Tools) for the development of proprietary software.

<text>The Diocese of Meath is a nineteenth-century publication on the history of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Meath from medieval to nineteenth century times, written by one of the Diocese&#x27;s priests, Dean Cogan, a priest in Navan, the then Diocesan capital.

Published in two volumes in 1862 and 1867, it was an important history of Christianity in Ireland, because Cogan made use of three sources of information:

* folklore and memories of people alive in Meath the 1850s and 1860s (covering the period from the Penal Laws to the Great Famine (1845–49)) which were recorded in great detail.
* access to the Meath diocese&#x27;s archives; when the Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath moved from his former seat in Navan to the new cathedral in Mullingar in the early twentieth century (the diocesan seminary, &quot;St. Finians&quot;, also moved from Navan to Mullingar) the diocesan archives were lost in the process. How the priceless records, many of them by Cogan in his research in the 1860s, were lost remains a mystery;
* access to papers relating to the church in Meath in the Irish Public Records Office. The Irish Public Records Office was destroyed by the Irish Republican Army in 1922, in effect destroying one thousand years of records, including most of the records from that source quoted by Cogan.

As a result, Cogan&#x27;s book details parish histories, information on derelict churches, information on old burial sites where those who died in the Famine were buried, names of priests, details of the Penal Law, and information on the re-appearance of a Roman Catholic clerical structure following the reformation from sources that are no longer available to historians.

<text>James Riley Blake (born December 28, 1979) is an American former professional tennis player. He won 10 titles on the ATP Tour (out of 24 finals contested), reaching a career-high singles ranking of world No. 4. His career highlights included reaching the final of the 2006 Tennis Masters Cup, the semifinals of the 2008 Beijing Olympics (beating world No. 1 Roger Federer en route), the quarterfinals of the 2008 Australian Open and 2005 and 2006 US Opens, two titles at the Hopman Cup (in 2003 and 2004) and being the American No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles. Blake was also a key performer for the victorious United States 2007 Davis Cup team, winning both his matches in the championship tie against Russia.

In 2004, Blake fractured a vertebra in an accident while training. He made a full recovery, and in 2005 he was presented with the Comeback Player of the Year award for his return to the tour. Later, in 2008, Blake was named the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year. Blake&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Breaking Back: How I Lost Everything and Won Back My Life&quot;, co-written with Andrew Friedman, discussed his comeback after his 2004 season. It was released on July 3. 2007, and debuted at No. 22 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Blake retired from professional tennis at the 2013 US Open, being defeated in five sets against Ivo Karlovic and in three sets in 
men&#x27;s doubles.

==Early life and education==
Blake was born in Yonkers, New York, to an African American father, Thomas Reynolds Blake, and a British mother, Betty. He has a brother Thomas, who has also been a professional tennis player, and three older half-brothers: Jason, Christopher, and Howard, and a half-sister Michelle.

Blake started playing tennis at the age of five alongside his older brother Thomas. When he was 13, he was diagnosed with severe scoliosis, and for five years as a teenager he was forced to wear a full-length back brace for 18 hours a day, though not while playing tennis.

The Blake family moved to Fairfield, Connecticut when Blake&#x27;s father&#x27;s job selling surgical supplies took him from New York to Hartford, Connecticut. Blake attended Fairfield High School, where a schoolmate and childhood friend was future musician John Mayer. Blake was inspired to pursue tennis after hearing his role model Arthur Ashe speak to the Harlem Junior Tennis Program. Brian Barker was his first (and longtime) coach. Blake left Harvard University, where he was a member of the A.D. Club, after his sophomore year to pursue a career in professional tennis.
In 2018, he was elected into the ITA Collegiate Hall of Fame.

==Career==

===Early career===

====2001====
At the age of 21, Blake saw his first Davis Cup action in 2001 against India and became the third person of African-American heritage to play for the Davis Cup for the United States (after Arthur Ashe and MaliVai Washington). Ranked no. 120 in the world, Blake accepted a wild card into Cincinnati Masters. He beat a qualifier and Arnaud Clément to reach the round of 16, where he met Patrick Rafter. Blake came close to winning the first set (falling in a tiebreak), and after dropping the second set, Rafter, according to Blake&#x27;s autobiography, complimented him at the net and boosted his confidence immeasurably by saying, &quot;Now do you believe you can beat someone like me, or even me?&quot; Blake&#x27;s name became more recognizable worldwide after he pushed the eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt to five sets at the US Open.

====2002====
In January 2002, Blake won the 2002 USTA Waikoloa Challenger in Hawaii. A month later in Memphis he posted his first win over a top-10 ranked opponent, Tommy Haas, who was then ranked no. 5, and reached the final, losing to Andy Roddick. He reached the quarterfinals at the ATP Masters Series (AMS) event in Rome in May and the final at Newport in July. In August, in Cincinnati, he won his first career ATP Tour title and his first ATP Masters Series title: it came in doubles with Todd Martin, making Blake the first African-American male to win a title of any kind in Cincinnati&#x27;s 101-year history. He was also the first African-American to reach a final in Cincinnati since 1969, when Arthur Ashe reached the doubles finals with Charlie Pasarell. The next week in Washington, he won his first ATP Tour singles title, beating Andre Agassi in the semifinals and Paradorn Srichaphan in the final. At the US Open, he reached the third round, where he again faced the top-ranked and world number one Lleyton Hewitt for the rematch of the previous year. In an entertaining match Blake was again defeated in five sets.

====2003====
In 2003, his best results were a quarterfinals appearance at Indian Wells; a round of 16 finish at the Australian Open, Cincinnati, and Miami; a semifinal appearance at San Jose, and a finals appearance at Long Island, where he lost to Srichaphan. Blake was eliminated from the US Open in the 3rd round by Roger Federer.

====2004====
2004 was a difficult year for Blake. In May, while practicing with Robby Ginepri for the Masters event in Rome, he broke his neck when he slipped on the clay and collided with the net post. Blake fractured his seventh vertebra, but did not sustain any nerve damage and was ultimately able to make a full recovery from the injury. In July, his father died of stomach cancer. At the same time, Blake developed shingles, which temporarily paralyzed half his face and blurred his vision.

===2005–2008===

====2005====
Blake&#x27;s injuries and personal issues caused him to post relatively poor results for the first half of 2005. By April his ranking was 210. He decided to play the Challenger circuit, the &quot;minor leagues&quot; of tennis, in order to regain confidence and get more matches. In May he entered events in Tunica, Mississippi and Forest Hills, New York, and won both. He rejoined the ATP circuit and by August reached the final at the International Series event in Washington, D.C., where he fell to Roddick. He was given a wild card into AMS Cincinnati, drawing Federer in the first round. He then won the Pilot Pen Tennis tournament in New Haven, Connecticut, defeating Feliciano López in the final. After New Haven he was ranked 49.

Blake accepted a wildcard into the US Open. After defeating No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the round of 32, Blake beat Tommy Robredo in four sets to reach the quarterfinals where he faced Andre Agassi. The late-evening match is considered one of the greatest classics in the tournament&#x27;s history. Blake was up two sets and a break in the third when Agassi made a comeback to eventually win in a fifth-set tiebreak. After the match Agassi said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t the winner, tennis was&quot;. Later in October at the Stockholm Open, Blake won his third ATP tour title, defeating Srichaphan in the final. Blake finished 2005 ranked 22 in the world.

====2006====
At the beginning of 2006, Blake won the title at Sydney, taking his fourth ATP tour title defeating Russian Igor Andreev in the final. At the Australian Open he was seeded 20th, and despite losing in the third round to Spaniard Tommy Robredo he broke into the top 20 for the first time in his career. In March he beat Hewitt in the final at Las Vegas for his fifth ATP tour title. At the first AMS event of the year Indian Wells, Blake defeated Robredo in the third round and world No. 2 Nadal in the semifinals, reaching his first career ATP Masters Series singles final, losing in the final to Federer. By reaching the final, Blake became the first African-American man since Arthur Ashe to reach the world&#x27;s top 10.

At the French Open he defeated Spaniard Nicolás Almagro in four sets in the second round, to become the last remaining American, and then was beaten by Frenchman Gaël Monfils in five sets. Beginning the grass court season at the Stella Artois Championships, he defeated Andy Roddick in the semifinals, losing to Lleyton Hewitt in the final. Ranked No. 5, Blake took part in the International Series at Indianapolis. He won the singles title, defeating Roddick (for the second time in 2006). At the US Open he reached the quarterfinals, losing to top seed and defending champion Roger Federer. In that match Blake won his first ever set against Federer, winning the third set in a tiebreaker 11–9.

In his debut appearance at the Thailand Open in Bangkok, Blake won his seventh singles title, defeating Jarkko Nieminen in the quarterfinals, Marat Safin in the semifinals, and Ivan Ljubičić (for the first time) in the final.
Two weeks later Blake won his fifth title of 2006, defending his 2005 title in Stockholm, defeating Jarkko Nieminen. For the first time, Blake qualified for the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. He went 2–1 in the Gold Group, defeating No. 2 Nadal and No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko, while losing to No. 6 Tommy Robredo. He qualified for the semifinals, beating defending champion David Nalbandian, losing the final to Federer. Blake finished 2006 at a career-high World Number 4 and as the highest-ranked American tennis player.

====2007====
In 2007 Blake won at the Sydney International for the second consecutive year. However, he then suffered a disappointing loss in the Round of 16 at the Australian Open, losing to tenth seed and eventual finalist Fernando González. In February, Blake made it to the final of the Delray Beach tournament, but lost it to the Belgian Xavier Malisse in three tight sets.

At the 2007 Tennis Channel Open in Las Vegas, as the defending champion, he was involved with a deep controversy. It was one of the several tournaments experimenting with the new round robin format, and Blake had lost his first match to Evgeny Korolev. Korolev lost his other match to Juan Martín del Potro. In order to advance to the quarterfinals, Blake had to defeat Del Potro in straight sets while losing five games or less. This would result in a three-way tie, with Blake losing the fewest games. With Blake leading 6–1, 3–1, Del Potro retired. This eliminated Del Potro from the three-way tie as he failed to complete one of his matches. Korolev then moved on to the next round, breaking the tie as he had defeated Blake in their direct match. Soon after, the organizers overruled the tournament guidelines, giving Blake a place in the quarterfinals. The following morning however, they changed the decision once again and as a result, Korolev re-advanced to the quarterfinals, while Blake was sent away from the tournament. Shortly after this incident, the ATP decided to cancel the round robin format, reverting any tournaments planning a round robin draw to the standard single-elimination draw.

During the summer hardcourt season, he advanced to his second career ATP Masters Series final. At AMS Cincinnati, he beat Alejandro Falla, Nicolas Kiefer, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Sam Querrey and Nikolay Davydenko en route to the final before falling to Roger Federer. He won the singles title at Penn Pilot in New Haven, Connecticut, and reached the final at Los Angeles, losing to Radek Štěpánek in three sets after having three set points in the first set. In the second round of the 2007 US Open, he won his first career five-set match against Fabrice Santoro. Blake made it to the fourth round, where he lost to No. 10 Tommy Haas in five sets, despite having match points in the fifth set. In September Blake and the rest of the US Davis Cup team defeated Sweden to reach the finals against Russia.

Blake lost in the third round of Paris to Richard Gasquet and thus finished outside the top eight players, losing his chance to defend the points he gained as finalist in the 2006 Tennis Masters Cup. In the 2007 Davis Cup finals Blake won his match against Mikhail Youzhny after Andy Roddick had beaten Dmitry Tursunov in the first rubber. The next day Bob and Mike Bryan won the doubles rubber over Igor Andreev and Nikolay Davydenko, sealing the Davis Cup win for the United States. Blake also defeated Tursunov in the last match of the finals to give Team USA 4–1 win.

====2008====
At the Australian Open, Blake defeated his first round opponent, Chilean Nicolás Massú. He then defeated compatriot Michael Russell. In the third round, he fought back from two sets down to beat French veteran Sébastien Grosjean who had beaten him in each of their three previous meetings. In the fourth round, Blake beat Marin Čilić in three sets to advance to the quarterfinals, his best showing yet down under. In the quarterfinal, Blake faced world No. 1 Roger Federer, and fell in straight sets. Although out of the Australian Open, Blake&#x27;s ranking jumped back into the top 10 to No. 9 following his best performance in the tournament yet.

In Delray Beach, Blake made it to the final for the second consecutive year, but fell to No. 244 Kei Nishikori of Japan in three sets in the final. At the 2008 Pacific Life Open, Blake reached the quarter-finals before losing to Rafael Nadal in three sets. They met again in the next tournament at the 2008 Miami Masters also in the quarter-finals, and again Blake lost to Nadal in three sets. Blake then started the clay court season at the River Oaks International tournament in Houston, Texas. In his second ATP final of the year and his first career clay-court final, Blake fell to Spaniard Marcel Granollers.

In August 2008, Blake represented the United States as one of its three men&#x27;s singles tennis players in the Beijing Olympics. In the quarterfinals, he gained one of the biggest wins of his career with his first ever win over Roger Federer 6–4, 7–6. At the time, Federer was ranked as the world&#x27;s No. 1 men&#x27;s player. His semifinal match was against Fernando González, the Men&#x27;s Singles bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Blake had a triple match point in the final set, but would go on to lose 11–9. He then lost the bronze medal match to Serbian Novak Djokovic.

In the US Open, Blake was stretched to a 5 set thriller against American teenager Donald Young in the first round. Blake easily won his second round match after Steve Darcis retired and then lost to friend and fellow American Mardy Fish in the third round in straight sets.

=== Later career ===

====2009====

Blake defeated Frank Dancevic in the first round of the Australian Open. His success continued in the second round after deposing of Frenchman Sébastien de Chaunac in a match laden with spectator noise and bad line calls. Blake went on to face the 18th seed, Igor Andreev, in the third round and beat him. He lost in the fourth round in straight sets to the 2008 runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
At the 2009 Estoril Open Blake advanced to his first clay-court final on European soil, after beating second seed and former Estoril Open champion Nikolay Davydenko in a rain-interrupted semi-final that was carried over due to bad light. Blake was defeated by Spain&#x27;s Albert Montañés later that day in the finals. The 28-year-old Montanes saved two match points at 4–5 in the second set and fought back to beat fourth-seeded Blake in two hours and 14 minutes.

At the Aegon Championships at Queen&#x27;s Club, Blake defeated Ivan Ljubičić, Sam Querrey, and Mikhail Youzhny to reach the semi-finals. He then reached the final after Andy Roddick retired with an ankle injury in the first set when the score was tied at 4 games all. He then went on to lose in the final to Andy Murray. After being eliminated in the first round of the singles, Blake partnered with compatriot Mardy Fish at the Wimbledon Men&#x27;s Doubles. The Americans advanced to the semi-finals where they lost to defending champions Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić despite winning the first two sets.

Following a 3rd round loss at the 2009 US Open to Spain&#x27;s Tommy Robredo, Blake split with longtime coach Brian Barker. He was replaced by Kelly Jones.

====2010====
At the 2010 Australian Open, Blake lost to fourth seed and US Open champion Juan Martín del Potro in the second round in five sets (8–10 final set). He then missed the clay court season due to a knee injury. Blake returned to action at Wimbledon, where he lost in the first round to Robin Haase, during which Blake accused ESPN commentator and former WTA player Pam Shriver of disrupting play due to her overly loud commentary from the box situated above the court behind him. This led to a verbal exchange between the two during the match. After the match, Blake declared that if his knee problems did not subside he would consider retirement. Blake, who refused to take any anti-inflammatories for his knee, called his performance &quot;embarrassing&quot; and said &quot;I can&#x27;t beat these guys at 80 percent.&quot; Despite these comments, Blake played the US Summer hard court season, and reached the third round of the 2010 US Open, where he lost to eventual finalist Novak Djokovic. Blake finished the year ranked outside the Top 100 for the first time since 2000.

====2011–2013====
Between the beginning of 2011–2013, Blake remained ranked outside the world&#x27;s top 50, due to recurring injuries and loss of form. During the three seasons, he reached a single ATP-tour semifinal, at the 2011 Stockholm Open. At the US Open in August 2013, Blake announced his retirement.
In 2019, he was elected to the Collegiate Hall of Fame.

====2023====
James Blake returned to the tour in May 2023, after 10 years off the tour. Blake entered an M15 Rancho Santa Fe event in the doubles using a wildcard.

==Playing style==

Blake was primarily an offensive baseliner. Blake was known for possessing one of the most powerful forehands in the game, with a solid transition game, and an effective serve and volley. Blake also possessed extremely quick footwork, although many claimed that he needed to work on changing direction. Blake&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;shotmaker,&quot; combined with potentially high-error flat groundstrokes made his style of play notably flashy, characterized by both a high number of winners and unforced errors. In turn, this made Blake&#x27;s game somewhat streaky, as evidenced by his playing history.

==Equipment and endorsements==
Blake worked with Prince to create a new racquet with Prince&#x27;s O3 technology. However, he did not feel comfortable with this racquet. So, he switched back to the Dunlop Sport Aerogel 200, then the 4D 200, for the 2009 season. He changed to Wilson at the start of the 2010 season, using the new Six.One Tour strung with Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power 16L strings at high tension (60+ pounds). He did not feel comfortable with this racquet either. Therefore, he switched back to Dunlop again. After the US Open of 2010, he began to test out rackets for Head. As August 26, 2011, he announced he will use Donnay rackets as his choice and using a customized Donnay X-Dual Pro. His clothing sponsor is Fila, with whom he started working in 2009 after using Nike for most his career. He has his own clothing line named Thomas Reynolds Collection after his father.

Blake signed an endorsement deal with Evian in 2005 and his contract was extended in 2008.

==Personal life==
Blake married publicist Emily Snider in Del Mar, California, in 2012. The couple have two daughters and live in Solana Beach.

Blake enjoys golf and basketball and is a fan of the New York Mets. He was featured on Bravo&#x27;s second edition of &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot; but placed 2nd after losing to Maura Tierney.

Blake was also a red pro on &quot;Full Tilt Poker&quot;, though he has not been active there since shortly before Black Friday. He appeared in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; issue. He is good friends with singer/songwriter John Mayer, who also attended Fairfield High School. When Blake was invited by Virginia&#x27;s Anthem to do a cancer charity game honoring his late father, he invited Mayer, Andy Roddick, and Gavin DeGraw to perform.

===2015 NYPD incident===
On September 9, 2015, Blake was thrown down to the sidewalk, handcuffed, and arrested by a plainclothes New York City Police Department officer in front of the Grand Hyatt New York after being mistaken for a suspect of interest. The officers were relying on a witness and photo of a suspect that looked similar to Blake: they mistook him for a credit-card fraud suspect staying in the same hotel. Commissioner William Bratton apologized for the mistake and stated the &quot;arrest raised serious questions about [the officer&#x27;s] actions&quot; but denied allegations of racism. Blake sued, but withdrew his claim, saying he was not looking for financial compensation, &quot;on the condition that the city establish a legal fellowship to investigate police misconduct and advocate for victims of brutality.&quot;

The violence of the arrest has prompted Blake to take a more active stand on police brutality against minorities. He met with Bratton and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. He has also written a book, &quot;Ways of Grace: Stories of Activism, Adversity, and How Sports Can Bring Us Together&quot;, published in June 2017 that details the incident and his shift to activism as a result. Blake was subsequently sued for defamation by the officer who had mistakenly arrested Blake as the book portrayed the officer &quot;as a racist and a goon&quot;. The lawsuit was dismissed by a judge in September 2018.

==Philanthropy==
In 2008 Blake established The James Blake Foundation, which &quot;invests vital seed money at the leading-edge of science: speed up the most promising work, and shortening the time it takes to turn lab discoveries into better treatments for patients.&quot; Since 2005, he has hosted Anthem Live!, a charity tennis exhibition and musical event in Virginia and New York City to raise money for cancer research. In July 2008, Blake established the Thomas Blake Sr. Memorial Research Fund to support cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The fund was named in memory of his father, who died from gastric cancer in 2004. Nike and Fila, which sponsored Blake, created T-shirts for Blake&#x27;s charity, the J-Block program, and proceeds went to the Cancer Research Fund.

<doc id="259056" wikidata="Q934729" url="?curid=259056" title="Primary key">
<text>In the relational model of databases, a primary key is a designated attribute (column) that can reliably identify and distinguish between each individual record in a table. The database creator can choose an existing unique attribute or combination of attributes from the table (a natural key) to act as its primary key, or create a new attribute containing a unique ID that exists solely for this purpose (a surrogate key). 

Examples of natural keys that could be suitable primary keys include data that is already by definition unique to all items in the table such as a national identification number attribute for person records, or the combination of a very precise timestamp attribute with a very precise location attribute for event records.

More formally, a primary key is a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes that uniquely specify a tuple (row) in a relation (table). A primary key is a choice of a candidate key (a minimal superkey); any other candidate key is an alternate key.

==Design==
In relational database terms, a primary key does not differ in form or function from a key that isn&#x27;t primary. In practice, various motivations may determine the choice of any one key as primary over another. The designation of a primary key may indicate the &quot;preferred&quot; identifier for data in the table, or that the primary key is to be used for foreign key references from other tables or it may indicate some other technical rather than semantic feature of the table. Some languages and software have special syntax features that can be used to identify a primary key as such (e.g. the PRIMARY KEY constraint in SQL).

The relational model, as expressed through relational calculus and relational algebra, does not distinguish between primary keys and other kinds of keys. Primary keys were added to the SQL standard mainly as a convenience to the application programmer.

Primary keys can be an integer that is incremented, a universally unique identifier (UUID) or can be generated using Hi/Lo algorithm.

==Defining primary keys in SQL==
Primary keys are defined in the ISO SQL Standard, through the PRIMARY KEY constraint. The syntax to add such a constraint to an existing table is defined in like this:
ALTER TABLE &lt;table identifier&gt; 
 ADD [ CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint identifier&gt; ] 
 PRIMARY KEY ( &lt;column name&gt; [ {, &lt;column name&gt; }... ] )
The primary key can also be specified directly during table creation. In the SQL Standard, primary keys may consist of one or multiple columns. Each column participating in the primary key is implicitly defined as NOT NULL. Note that some RDBMS require explicitly marking primary key columns as codice_1.
CREATE TABLE table_name (
 ...


If the primary key consists only of a single column, the column can be marked as such using the following syntax:
CREATE TABLE table_name (
 id_col INT PRIMARY KEY,
 col2 CHARACTER VARYING(20),
)
==Surrogate keys==

In some circumstances the natural key that uniquely identifies a tuple in a relation may be cumbersome to use for software development. For example, it may involve multiple columns or large text fields. In such cases, a surrogate key can be used instead as the primary key. In other situations there may be more than one candidate key for a relation, and no candidate key is obviously preferred. A surrogate key may be used as the primary key to avoid giving one candidate key artificial primacy over the others.

Since primary keys exist primarily as a convenience to the programmer, surrogate primary keys are often used, in many cases exclusively, in database application design.

Due to the popularity of surrogate primary keys, many developers and in some cases even theoreticians have come to regard surrogate primary keys as an inalienable part of the relational data model. This is largely due to a migration of principles from the object-oriented programming model to the relational model, creating the hybrid object–relational model. In the ORM like active record pattern, these additional restrictions are placed on primary keys:

* Primary keys should be immutable, that is, never changed or re-used; they should be deleted along with the associated record.
* Primary keys should be anonymous integer or numeric identifiers.

However, neither of these restrictions is part of the relational model or any SQL standard. Due diligence should be applied when deciding on the immutability of primary key values during database and application design. Some database systems even imply that values in primary key columns cannot be changed using the codice_2 SQL statement.

==Alternate key==
Typically, one candidate key is chosen as the primary key. Other candidate keys become alternate keys, each of which may have a codice_3 constraint assigned to it in order to prevent duplicates (a duplicate entry is not valid in a unique column).

Alternate keys may be used like the primary key when doing a single-table select or when filtering in a &quot;where&quot; clause, but are not typically used to join multiple tables.

<text>Eichstätt is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Neuburg-Schrobenhausen, Donau-Ries, Weißenburg-Gunzenhausen, Roth, Neumarkt, Kelheim and Pfaffenhofen, and by the city of Ingolstadt.

==History==

The district of Eichstätt in its present form was established in 1972 by merging the former district of Eichstätt with parts of the dissolved districts of Ingolstadt, Beilngries, Riedenburg and Hilpoltstein. The city of Eichstätt lost its status as a district-free city and became the capital of the new district.
Today the Eichstätt district has powerful economic structures. The rate of jobless people is only 1.2% (June 2011).

==Geography==

The district is located in the southern part of the Frankish Alb. 80% of the district are situated in the Altmühltal Nature Park. In the southeast the Danube forms a short part of the border.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* a torch, symbolising the industrial area within the metropolitan area of Ingolstadt
* a crosier, symbolising the bishopric of Eichstätt
* an antler, symbolising the medieval county of Hirschberg (German &quot;Hirsch&quot; = &quot;deer&quot;)
* the blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria

<text>David John Duncan (30 June 1933 – 29 October 2018) was an award-winning Scottish Canadian fantasy and science fiction author.

==Biography==

Duncan was born in Newport-on-Tay, Scotland and was educated at the High School of Dundee before studying geology at the University of St Andrews. After graduating in 1955, he moved to Calgary, Alberta, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1960. He pursued a career as a geologist in the petroleum industry for nearly three decades before he started writing science fiction and fantasy novels. He made his first sale (&quot;A Rose-Red City&quot;) two years later in 1986 at the age of 53, just two weeks after his 31-year career as a geologist came to an end due to a slump in the oil business, at which point he switched to full-time writing.

Duncan lived in Victoria, British Columbia. His wife was Janet, whom he married in 1959, and they had one son, two daughters, and four grandchildren. He had one brother, Michael, who was an agriculturist.

Duncan died on 29 October 2018 at the age of 85.

==Writing career==

Duncan was a prolific writer and penned over fifty books.
His sixth book, &quot;West of January&quot;, won the 1990 Aurora award, an award he would win again in 2007 for &quot;Children of Chaos&quot;.
He was a member of SF Canada and in 2015 he was inducted into the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.

Although Duncan usually wrote under his own name, some of his early books were published under the pseudonyms Ken Hood and Sarah B. Franklin.

<text>Jia Qinglin (; born 13 March 1940) is a retired senior leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He was a member of the CCP&#x27;s Politburo Standing Committee, the party&#x27;s highest ruling organ, between 2002 and 2012, and Chairman of the National Committee of the People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference between 2003 and 2013.

Jia, an engineer by trade, began his political career in Fujian in 1985. There, he rose steadily through the ranks and led the province during the Yuanhua scandal. In 1996, Jia was transferred to become mayor, then party chief of Beijing. Largely due to his patronage relationship with then General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Jia was promoted to the Politburo in 1997, and remained a mainstay figure in China&#x27;s political elite for the next fifteen years. He retired in 2013.

== Political career ==

Jia Qinglin was born in 13 March 1940 in rural Jiaohe County (now Botou), Hebei, to an ordinary family of farmers. Owing to his academic ability, he was admitted to the Shijiazhuang Industrial Management School and majored in industrial enterprise planning. Starting in 1958, he began studying electrical motor and appliance design and manufacturing at the Hebei Institute of Technology (now Hebei University of Technology). After graduating in 1962, he was assigned a technician position at the First Machine-Building Ministry and became involved in the Communist Youth League.

During the Cultural Revolution, Jia joined his educated contemporaries to perform manual labor at the May 7 Cadre School at the First Machine Building Ministry in Fengxin County, Jiangxi Province. In 1971, he began work at the Policy Research Office of the First Machine-Building Industry Ministry. In 1973, he was promoted to chief of the product management bureau of the First Ministry of Machine-building Industry. In 1978, he was named general manager of the China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation. In 1983, he became director of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant and its party secretary.

As part of wider national efforts by the Communist Party to make officials across the country more youthful and educated, in 1985, Jia made his foray into regional politics, being admitted to the Fujian provincial party standing committee and serving as deputy party secretary. He later also took on the concurrent role as head of party organization in Fujian. In 1990, he was promoted to acting governor, confirmed in 1991. In 1993, Jia was promoted to Party Secretary of Fujian, the top office in the coastal province. When Jia was the party secretary of Fujian, Xi Jinping, the current General Secretary, was the deputy party secretary of Fujian from 1996.

Sometime during the 1990s, Jia gained the confidence of then-General Secretary Jiang Zemin, with whom he developed a patron-client relationship. Jia was transferred to Beijing in 1996 to serve as mayor, and in 1997 was promoted to the position of party secretary, helping Jiang consolidate the city&#x27;s political landscape after Chen Xitong was ousted on corruption charges. As Beijing party chief, Jia became a member of the Communist Party&#x27;s ruling Politburo. He also came onto the national and international spotlight during the 50th Anniversary celebrations of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the event&#x27;s master of ceremonies, reading prepared lines atop the Tiananmen Gate to millions of onlookers and television audiences.

== At the national level ==
Because of his high local position and his ties to Jiang, in November 2002, Jia was named to the 16th Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the Chinese Communist Party. Although his ceremonial role as the Chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, a quasi-consultative upper house in China&#x27;s political system, made him fourth in the official order of precedence, it was widely accepted that the position carried very little power, perhaps the least powerful in the nine PSC members. Jia Qinglin was the most senior Chinese official to attend the funeral of Zhao Ziyang. With the transition of authority to Hu Jintao, Jia appeared to have been given the job of coordinating policy on Taiwan.

In 2007, Jia was named again to the 17th Politburo Standing Committee during the 17th Party Congress. Prior to the congress, it was speculated that Jia may be thrown out of the running due to his tainted record as the party chief of Fujian during the Yuanhua scandal. However, largely owing to the backing of Jiang Zemin, Jia was able to remain on the body for one more term.

Jia exited from the Politburo Standing Committee in 2012 after reaching retirement age. He retired from politics for good in March 2013, when he relinquished his CPPCC post on schedule to Yu Zhengsheng. Jia continued to make public appearances in retirement. On 5 September 2015, Jia appeared at the China Victory Day Parade. On 21 December 2015, Jia visited Liancheng County in Fujian. In June 2016, Jia attended a science and innovation exhibition at the Beijing Exhibition Center. In October 2016, Jia showed up at the World Robot Conference in Beijing. On 17 May 2017, Jia met with Hebei University of Technology alumni at Zhongnanhai.

The financial dealings of Jia&#x27;s granddaughter Jasmine Li () and son-in-law Li Pak-tam were reported on by media during the Panama Papers scandal; Jasmine had been featured on Chinese tabloids for appearing at a Hotel de Crillon debutante ball in Paris in 2009 wearing a Carolina Herrera designer gown.

<text>A foreign key is a set of attributes in a table that refers to the primary key of another table, linking these two tables. In the context of relational databases, a foreign key is subject to an inclusion dependency constraint that the tuples consisting of the foreign key attributes in one relation, R, must also exist in some other (not necessarily distinct) relation, S; furthermore that those attributes must also be a candidate key in S.

In other words, a foreign key is a set of attributes that a candidate key. For example, a table called TEAM may have an attribute, MEMBER_NAME, which is a foreign key referencing a candidate key, PERSON_NAME, in the PERSON table. Since MEMBER_NAME is a foreign key, any value existing as the name of a member in TEAM must also exist as a person&#x27;s name in the PERSON table; in other words, every member of a TEAM is also a PERSON.

== Summary ==
The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the referenced or parent table. In database relational modeling and implementation, a candidate key is a set of zero or more attributes, the values of which are guaranteed to be unique for each tuple (row) in a relation. The value or combination of values of candidate key attributes for any tuple cannot be duplicated for any other tuple in that relation.

Since the purpose of the foreign key is to identify a particular row of referenced table, it is generally required that the foreign key is equal to the candidate key in some row of the primary table, or else have no value (the NULL value.). This rule is called a referential integrity constraint between the two tables.
Because violations of these constraints can be the source of many database problems, most database management systems provide mechanisms to ensure that every non-null foreign key corresponds to a row of the referenced table.

For example, consider a database with two tables: a CUSTOMER table that includes all customer data and an ORDER table that includes all customer orders. Suppose the business requires that each order must refer to a single customer. To reflect this in the database, a foreign key column is added to the ORDER table (e.g., CUSTOMERID), which references the primary key of CUSTOMER (e.g. ID). Because the primary key of a table must be unique, and because CUSTOMERID only contains values from that primary key field, we may assume that, when it has a value, CUSTOMERID will identify the particular customer which placed the order. However, this can no longer be assumed if the ORDER table is not kept up to date when rows of the CUSTOMER table are deleted or the ID column altered, and working with these tables may become more difficult. Many real world databases work around this problem by &#x27;inactivating&#x27; rather than physically deleting master table foreign keys, or by complex update programs that modify all references to a foreign key when a change is needed.

Foreign keys play an essential role in database design. One important part of database design is making sure that relationships between real-world entities are reflected in the database by references, using foreign keys to refer from one table to another.
Another important part of database design is database normalization, in which tables are broken apart and foreign keys make it possible for them to be reconstructed.

Multiple rows in the referencing (or child) table may refer to the same row in the referenced (or parent) table. In this case, the relationship between the two tables is called a one to many relationship between the referencing table and the referenced table.

In addition, the child and parent table may, in fact, be the same table, i.e. the foreign key refers back to the same table. Such a foreign key is known in as a self-referencing or recursive foreign key. In database management systems, this is often accomplished by linking a first and second reference to the same table.

A table may have multiple foreign keys, and each foreign key can have a different parent table. Each foreign key is enforced independently by the database system. Therefore, cascading relationships between tables can be established using foreign keys.

A foreign key is defined as an attribute or set of attributes in a relation whose values match a primary key in another relation. The syntax to add such a constraint to an existing table is defined in as shown below. Omitting the column list in the codice_1 clause implies that the foreign key shall reference the primary key of the referenced table.
Likewise, foreign keys can be defined as part of the codice_2 SQL statement.
CREATE TABLE child_table (
 col1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 col2 CHARACTER VARYING(20),
 col3 INTEGER,
 col4 INTEGER,
 FOREIGN KEY(col3, col4) REFERENCES parent_table(col1, col2) ON DELETE CASCADE


If the foreign key is a single column only, the column can be marked as such using the following syntax:
CREATE TABLE child_table (
 col1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 col2 CHARACTER VARYING(20),
 col3 INTEGER,
 col4 INTEGER REFERENCES parent_table(col1) ON DELETE CASCADE


Foreign keys can be defined with a stored procedure statement.
sp_foreignkey child_table, parent_table, col3, col4
* child_table: the name of the table or view that contains the foreign key to be defined.
* parent_table: the name of the table or view that has the primary key to which the foreign key applies. The primary key must already be defined.
* col3 and col4: the name of the columns that make up the foreign key. The foreign key must have at least one column and at most eight columns.

== Referential actions ==

Because the database management system enforces referential constraints, it must ensure data integrity if rows in a referenced table are to be deleted (or updated). If dependent rows in referencing tables still exist, those references have to be considered. specifies 5 different referential actions that shall take place in such occurrences:
* CASCADE
* RESTRICT
* NO ACTION
* SET NULL
* SET DEFAULT

=== CASCADE ===
Whenever rows in the parent (referenced) table are deleted (or updated), the respective rows of the child (referencing) table with a matching foreign key column will be deleted (or updated) as well. This is called a cascade delete (or update).

=== RESTRICT ===
A value cannot be updated or deleted when a row exists in a referencing or child table that references the value in the referenced table.

Similarly, a row cannot be deleted as long as there is a reference to it from a referencing or child table.

To understand RESTRICT (and CASCADE) better, it may be helpful to notice the following difference, which might not be immediately clear. The referential action CASCADE modifies the &quot;behavior&quot; of the (child) table itself where the word CASCADE is used. For example, ON DELETE CASCADE effectively says &quot;When the referenced row is deleted from the other table (master table), then delete &quot;also from me&quot;&quot;. However, the referential action RESTRICT modifies the &quot;behavior&quot; of the master table, &quot;not&quot; the child table, although the word RESTRICT appears in the child table and not in the master table! So, ON DELETE RESTRICT effectively says: &quot;When someone tries to delete the row from the other table (master table), prevent deletion &quot;from that other table&quot; (and of course, also don&#x27;t delete from me, but that&#x27;s not the main point here).&quot;

RESTRICT is not supported by Microsoft SQL 2012 and earlier.

=== NO ACTION ===
NO ACTION and RESTRICT are very much alike. The main difference between NO ACTION and RESTRICT is that with NO ACTION the referential integrity check is done after trying to alter the table. RESTRICT does the check before trying to execute the UPDATE or DELETE statement. Both referential actions act the same if the referential integrity check fails: the UPDATE or DELETE statement will result in an error.

In other words, when an UPDATE or DELETE statement is executed on the referenced table using the referential action NO ACTION, the DBMS verifies at the end of the statement execution that none of the referential relationships are violated. This is different from RESTRICT, which assumes at the outset that the operation will violate the constraint. Using NO ACTION, the triggers or the semantics of the statement itself may yield an end state in which no foreign key relationships are violated by the time the constraint is finally checked, thus allowing the statement to complete successfully.

=== SET NULL, SET DEFAULT ===
In general, the action taken by the DBMS for SET NULL or SET DEFAULT is the same for both ON DELETE or ON UPDATE: the value of the affected referencing attributes is changed to NULL for SET NULL, and to the specified default value for SET DEFAULT.

=== Triggers ===
Referential actions are generally implemented as implied triggers (i.e. triggers with system-generated names, often hidden.) As such, they are subject to the same limitations as user-defined triggers, and their order of execution relative to other triggers may need to be considered; in some cases it may become necessary to replace the referential action with its equivalent user-defined trigger to ensure proper execution order, or to work around mutating-table limitations.

Another important limitation appears with transaction isolation: your changes to a row may not be able to fully cascade because the row is referenced by data your transaction cannot &quot;see&quot;, and therefore cannot cascade onto. An example: while your transaction is attempting to renumber a customer account, a simultaneous transaction is attempting to create a new invoice for that same customer; while a CASCADE rule may fix all the invoice rows your transaction can see to keep them consistent with the renumbered customer row, it won&#x27;t reach into another transaction to fix the data there; because the database cannot guarantee consistent data when the two transactions commit, one of them will be forced to roll back (often on a first-come-first-served basis.)
CREATE TABLE account (acct_num INT, amount DECIMAL(10,2));

CREATE TRIGGER ins_sum BEFORE INSERT ON account
 FOR EACH ROW SET @sum = @sum + NEW.amount;
== Example ==
As a first example to illustrate foreign keys, suppose an accounts database has a table with invoices and each invoice is associated with a particular supplier. Supplier details (such as name and address) are kept in a separate table; each supplier is given a &#x27;supplier number&#x27; to identify it. Each invoice record has an attribute containing the supplier number for that invoice. Then, the &#x27;supplier number&#x27; is the primary key in the Supplier table. The foreign key in the Invoice table points to that primary key. The relational schema is the following. Primary keys are marked in bold, and foreign keys are marked in italics.

 Supplier (SupplierNumber, Name, Address)
 Invoice (InvoiceNumber, Text, &quot;SupplierNumber&quot;)

The corresponding Data Definition Language statement is as follows.

CREATE TABLE Supplier (
 SupplierNumber INTEGER NOT NULL,
 Name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
 Address VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT supplier_pk PRIMARY KEY(SupplierNumber),
 CONSTRAINT number_value CHECK(SupplierNumber &gt; 0)

CREATE TABLE Invoice (
 InvoiceNumber INTEGER NOT NULL,
 Text VARCHAR(4096),
 SupplierNumber INTEGER NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT invoice_pk PRIMARY KEY(InvoiceNumber),
 CONSTRAINT inumber_value CHECK (InvoiceNumber &gt; 0),
 CONSTRAINT supplier_fk
 FOREIGN KEY(SupplierNumber) REFERENCES Supplier(SupplierNumber)
 ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT

<doc id="259067" wikidata="Q189519" url="?curid=259067" title="Zeng Qinghong">
<text>Zeng Qinghong (, born 30 July 1939) is a retired Chinese politician. He was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, China&#x27;s highest leadership council, and First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee between 2002 and 2007. He also served as the Vice President of China from 2003 to 2008. During the 1990s, Zeng was a close ally of then-Party general secretary Jiang Zemin, and was instrumental in consolidating Jiang&#x27;s power. For years, Zeng was the primary force behind the party&#x27;s organization and personnel.

==Early life==
Zeng was born to a family of Hakka background in Ji&#x27;an, Jiangxi province, in July 1939. He was the son of Zeng Shan, a communist revolutionary and later Minister of the Interior, and Deng Liujin (), a notable female participant of the Long March. Zeng was the eldest of five children. He graduated from Beijing 101 Middle School and the Automatic Control Department at the Beijing Institute of Technology. Zeng was an engineer, a specialist in automatic control systems. He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1960. Due to the revolutionary heritage of his father, Zeng was seen as a member of the so-called &quot;Crown Prince Party&quot;, the descendants of veteran revolutionaries.

Zeng spent the early part of his career as a technician in the military defense industry in Beijing. He was sent down to do manual labor on People&#x27;s Liberation Army bases in Hunan and Guangdong during the Cultural Revolution. With the opening of the reform era, Zeng joined the State Development and Reform Commission in 1979 and then held a series of management positions in the state petroleum sector, including a series of foreign liaison positions with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.

==Climbing the ranks==
In 1984, Zeng began working for the Shanghai municipal government, where he became a key ally of then-Party Committee Secretary Jiang Zemin. When Jiang was elevated to General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in national leadership re-shuffle following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he brought Zeng Qinghong along as his adviser.

As the deputy chief of the General Office of the Chinese Communist Party from 1989 to 1993, Zeng guided Jiang, an outsider to national politics, through the inner workings of the party, military and bureaucratic structure in Beijing. He promoted Jiang&#x27;s leadership and thinking, broadened Jiang&#x27;s network, and became Jiang&#x27;s right-hand-man. Over the 1990s, Zeng consolidated control of party organs responsible for the appointment of cadres to important political positions. As head of the party&#x27;s Organization Department from 1999 to 2002, Zeng strengthened Jiang&#x27;s position by promoting members of the Jiang&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai clique&quot; to leading central and regional posts. He also helped propagate Jiang&#x27;s guiding political philosophy known as the &quot;Three Represents&quot; inside the party.

Over the next decade, he acquired a reputation as Jiang&#x27;s &#x27;hatchet man&#x27; against rivals. In 1992 he supposedly helped Jiang remove President Yang Shangkun and elder PLA General Yang Baibing, who threatened Jiang&#x27;s support within the military. Then, he used an anti-corruption campaign to orchestrate the downfall of Beijing party chief and Jiang&#x27;s foe Chen Xitong. Because he was seen to represent highly partisan interests, many of Jiang&#x27;s factional opponents were said to be highly resistant to Zeng joining the Politburo as a full member for years. However, Jiang made it clear that a &#x27;pre-condition&#x27; for his stepping down at the 16th Party Congress was for Zeng to become a member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee.

==Politburo Standing Committee==
At the 16th Party Congress held in 2002, Zeng became a member of the 16th Central Committee, a member of its Politburo and of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), the Party&#x27;s central decision-making body, as well as serving as the First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party, responsible for party administrative affairs and policy coordination.

During his term in the PSC, although he was formally ranked fifth, Zeng was seen as a &#x27;power broker&#x27; in the party, believed to possess power that was second only to General secretary Hu Jintao. Initially seen as a rival to general secretary Hu Jintao, Zeng was obliged to show a willingness to work towards consensus with the old guard following Jiang&#x27;s semi-retirement.

On 6 June 2003, Zeng issued an order &quot;not to play or sing &#x27;The Internationale&#x27; in any provincial, city or county level party or party member meetings.&quot; The move was characterized as distancing China from orthodox communist doctrine.

Although Jiang stepped down from the PSC to make way for a younger &quot;fourth generation&quot; of leadership led by Hu Jintao, Jiang continued to wield significant influence on the new group of leaders, particularly through Zeng. Due in large measure to Zeng&#x27;s efforts, six out of the nine new members of the Standing Committee, Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Huang Ju, Li Changchun, Luo Gan, and Zeng himself, were linked to Jiang&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Clique&quot; and considered his allies.

As Jiang Zemin reached the end of his term, observers speculated that Jiang may well have preferred Zeng Qinghong over Hu Jintao as his successor. But Hu prevailed in succeeding Jiang, ostensibly because Hu was &#x27;handpicked&#x27; by former leader Deng Xiaoping. Zeng became vice-president in March 2003 at the National People&#x27;s Congress held that year. During the SARS outbreak, Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao took very strong and assertive action while Zeng and other Jiang loyalists receded to the background. Zeng was also initially expected to succeed Hu as Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission as a condition of Jiang&#x27;s resignation from the chairmanship in favor of Hu. However, when Jiang stepped down on 19 September 2004, Xu Caihou, and not Zeng, became vice-chairman.

===Shifting loyalties===
Although initially seen as a Jiang loyalist, observers characterized Zeng as much more sophisticated and shrewd and possessing more political savvy compared to his former boss Jiang. In addition, Zeng was said to differ with Jiang&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Clique&quot; on policy preferences. Zeng was an important figure within the highest ranks of party leadership. He was said to be a crucial player in pushing Jiang&#x27;s move towards full retirement in 2004, when Jiang relinquished his final title, Chairman of the Central Military Commission. Observers saw the push for Jiang&#x27;s retirement as indicating consensus between Zeng and Hu.

In the following years, Zeng emerged as a kingmaker-style figure, and a &#x27;point-man&#x27; for Hu to manage crises situations. After the death of Zhao Ziyang, the former party General Secretary who lost power following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Zeng worked as the intermediary between the Zhao&#x27;s family and the senior party leadership. Zeng also worked with Hu to manage the potential effects on China of the ouster of authoritarian regimes in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine. The head of the Ministry of State Security, China&#x27;s top intelligence organization, was said to report directly to Zeng, as his father was the former head of this agency. When Shanghai Party Committee Secretary Chen Liangyu was dismissed in September 2006, Zeng led the anti-corruption task force against his longtime political enemy since they were in Shanghai. Additionally, Zeng also played a leading role in coordinating the funeral service for Politburo Standing Committee member Huang Ju, who died of cancer in 2007.

===Departure===
At the 17th Party Congress held in 2007, Zeng departed from the Central Committee, its Politburo, and the Politburo Standing Committee. His departure, which was seen as his retirement because of age, meant that he could no longer serve on the Communist Party&#x27;s secretariat nor oversee the party&#x27;s organization. His Vice-presidency ended in March 2008 at the 2008 National People&#x27;s Congress. Before his retirement, however, Zeng used his political strength to secure the elevation of Xi Jinping and Zhou Yongkang into the Politburo Standing Committee. Xi, who succeeded Zeng in his posts of vice-president and executive secretary of the Secretariat, then became the heir apparent to succeed Hu Jintao as China&#x27;s top leader. Zhou, who was his closest subordinate in his &#x27;Oil Clique&#x27;, became the most powerful Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission. Since then Zeng has made public appearances only on a few ceremonial occasions, such as the 30th anniversary of the Third plenum of the 11th Central Committee in 2008. In 2023, Zeng reportedly led a group of party veterans in reprimanding Xi at the annual Beidaihe meeting.

===Son&#x27;s wealth===
In 2008, Zeng&#x27;s son, Zeng Wei (), paid over A$32 million (~US$24 million) to buy a luxurious Australian property located in Sydney; at the time, it was said to be the third most expensive residential property transaction in Australia. He further caused controversy with his fight to demolish and rebuild it. In 2007, an exposé published by finance magazine &quot;Caijing&quot; alleged that Zeng Wei had, through a series of complex corporate vehicles, completed the purchase of power generation giant Shandong Luneng at 70 billion yuan (~$10 billion) below market value, and that Zeng Wei was, for all intents and purposes, the real owner of the company despite his name not appearing in corporate documents.

<doc id="259068" wikidata="Q505710" url="?curid=259068" title="Huang Ju">
<text>Huang Ju (28 September 1938 – 2 June 2007) was a Chinese politician and a high-ranking leader in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He was one of the nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee of the CCP, China&#x27;s top decision making body, between 2002 until his death in 2007, and also served as the first-ranked vice premier of China beginning in 2003. He died in office before he could complete his terms on the Standing Committee and as vice premier.

An electrical engineer by trade, Huang was a close confidante of party leader Jiang Zemin, to whom he owed his rise to power. He served as mayor of Shanghai between 1991 and 1994, then Communist Party secretary of the metropolis between 1994 and 2002. Huang&#x27;s career in Shanghai and his family&#x27;s alleged involvement in several corruption cases in the city generated controversy. After 2002, Huang emerged as one of the least popular and most partisan members of China&#x27;s top leadership, and was named by observers as a &quot;core member&quot; of the Shanghai clique.

==Early life and career==
Huang was born in Shanghai and he was the second of five children in the family. Huang spent a long time in Zhejiang when he was young. From 1944 to 1950, he studied at Zhejiang Jiashan Yishan Primary School () and Qidong Primary School (). He attended Jiashan No.2 Middle School () and Jiaxing No.1 Middle School () for high school from 1950 to 1956. He attended Tsinghua University between 1956 and 1963 where he graduated in Electrical Engineering. In 1966, he joined the Chinese Communist Party.

Huang was employed as a technician in the foundry section of the Shanghai Artificial-board Machinery Factory () from 1963 to 1967. From 1967 to 1977, Huang worked as Technician in the power section of the Shanghai Zhonghua Metallurgical Factory (), where he also served as deputy lead of the production party group. He became deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee (during the Cultural Revolution, the highest day-to-day authority), Deputy Plant Manager, while working as an engineer, from 1977 to 1980. He was Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Petrochemical General Machinery Company () from 1980 to 1982. From 1982 to 1983 he was Deputy Commissioner of the Shanghai First Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau ().

==Shanghai politics==
From 1983 to 1984, Huang Ju served as a standing member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and secretary of the industry affairs committee; he was the Shanghai Party Committee&#x27;s secretary General from 1984 to 1985 and deputy party chief in charge of propaganda from 1985 to 1986.

In 1987, Huang was named as a candidate for the mayor of Shanghai, but received too few votes supporting his candidacy by the municipal People&#x27;s Congress. Zhu Rongji was subsequently elected mayor instead. When Zhu ascended to Beijing to become Vice Premier and governor of China&#x27;s central bank, Huang became mayor of Shanghai in 1991 and then the city&#x27;s party chief in 1994 after Wu Bangguo became Vice Premier. Huang served as Party secretary of Shanghai until October 2002. In September 1994 he entered the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party at the 4th Plenum of the 14th Central Committee.

Huang&#x27;s rise in Shanghai politics was largely credited to the patronage of Jiang Zemin, who served as the Party Committee secretary in Shanghai until the latter&#x27;s sudden appointment to become general secretary of the Communist Party following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Huang was seen as one of Jiang&#x27;s most trusted confidantes in Shanghai, and Jiang&#x27;s elevation to become the party&#x27;s top leader paved the way Huang to climb higher on the party&#x27;s career ladder. Huang was said to be so thankful of Jiang&#x27;s patronage that while on a working visit to New York during his term of Shanghai mayor, Huang and his entourage, immediately after leaving the airport, proceeded first thing to wine-and-dine Jiang&#x27;s son Jiang Mianheng.

During Huang&#x27;s term of party chief of Shanghai, he kept the city&#x27;s party organization in line, and is remembered by some as having raised the income of Shanghai residents. The Pudong New Area also saw explosive growth under Huang. While Shanghai&#x27;s economic growth continued during Huang Ju&#x27;s time as the city&#x27;s leader, most observers credit Shanghai&#x27;s success to the work of Zhu Rongji and Xu Kuangdi. Among the mayors of Shanghai in the late 20th century, Huang was the least popular. During his term as Shanghai party chief, Huang often criticized mayor Xu Kuangdi, and opposed Xu&#x27;s holding higher office. Because Xu was a popular figure in Shanghai, Huang&#x27;s open suppression of Xu damaged his reputation among ordinary residents. In Shanghai political circles, Huang earned a reputation as being extremely adept at crafting relationships with his superiors. However, both Huang&#x27;s successor Chen Liangyu and Jiang Zemin evaluated Huang&#x27;s term in Shanghai with gushing praise, stating that Huang was instrumental in contributing to Shanghai&#x27;s economic growth.

===Controversies===
In May 1994, after Huang&#x27;s installation as the Shanghai party chief, his wife Yu Huiwen, along with Shanghai official Chen Tiedi began a charity organization allegedly for money laundering for Huang&#x27;s wife and close colleagues, who received &quot;donations&quot; from the business elite. Although some of this money did indeed go to charity, there was a large amount of funds unaccounted for. It was unclear what Huang&#x27;s involvement was in this process, but it was clear that his power in Shanghai gave license to his family.

Huang was also believed to be implicated in the Shanghai real estate scandals involving Zhou Zhengyi, one of Shanghai&#x27;s business elite. Huang did little to curb monopolies in Shanghai&#x27;s booming real estate sector. Public protests resulted from residents being evicted from their homes (with little or no compensation) to make way for new construction. Zhou was eventually charged with multiple counts of fraud, but only sentenced to three years in prison, which analysts speculated was due to Huang exerting his influence on the municipal courts. 
In addition, Huang&#x27;s wife, Yu Huiwen, controlled the Shanghai pension fund, and was linked to Zhang Rongkun, who was at the centre of allegations of misappropriation of the fund&#x27;s money. Huang&#x27;s brother, who was made a high-ranking executive of a Pudong development firm, also moved funds for personal use.

==Ascension to Beijing==
Huang&#x27;s patron, general secretary Jiang Zemin, was due to leave his party leadership post in 2002, handing the reins of power to a new generation of leaders led by Hu Jintao. In the lead-up to the 16th Party Congress held in the autumn of 2002, Jiang worked to promote some of his former associates in Shanghai to the Politburo Standing Committee, the &quot;de facto&quot; top decision making body of the country. Initially Huang was said to have been offered to replace Ding Guangen to take over the central propaganda department, but Huang declined. Jiang also reportedly proposed that Huang lead the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, which entailed a seat on the Standing Committee. Eventually, it was settled that Huang would earn a seat on the Standing Committee as first-ranking vice premier assisting Wen Jiabao, replacing outgoing vice premier Li Lanqing.

Huang&#x27;s appointment was controversial, not only because of his poor reputation in Shanghai, but also because he was seen as highly partisan, and that he was tapped for promotion solely due to his coziness with Jiang and not as a result of tangible achievements. Zhu Rongji, then the outgoing premier and who had worked with Huang in Shanghai, was reportedly opposed to Huang&#x27;s elevation. Back in 1997, Huang&#x27;s election to the 15th Central Committee received only 1,455 votes in favour, out of 2,074 votes cast, and some 300 votes against, unusually low in Chinese national politics. This meant that nearly one third of party delegates did not even approve of Huang&#x27;s central committee membership. In 2002, of the full members of the Central Committee, Huang again received the lowest number of votes of anyone elected, meaning there was a real possibility that Huang would not have entered the Standing Committee at all, since Standing Committee members must be selected from the Central Committee.

Nevertheless, on 15 November 2002, Huang was officially named a member of the 9-man Politburo Standing Committee, joining other Jiang associates such as Jia Qinglin, Zeng Qinghong, and Li Changchun on the supreme body. In March 2003, he was confirmed by the National People&#x27;s Congress as vice premier of the State Council, ranking first.

His position as first vice premier was considered a figurehead role with little power, especially when compared to previous first vice premiers Yao Yilin, Zhu Rongji and Li Lanqing. His official portfolios were to oversee finance and banking. Huang served as a member of the Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs.

Huang&#x27;s political fate seemed to hang in the balance when his close former colleague Chen Liangyu was removed from the Politburo and put under investigation for corruption as part of the Shanghai pension scandal in 2006. By this time, Huang was already ill and cut back on public appearances. There was speculation that Huang would be implicated in the scandal.

==Illness==
In February 2006, the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; reported that Huang was seriously ill, and was expected to step down. Although some government officials said he had pancreatic cancer, the party did not, at the time, disclose the nature of his condition.
On 17 March, sources reported he was near death. Huang attended a Science and Technology forum in Beijing on 5 June, temporarily reducing speculation that he was soon going to die.

After giving a keynote speech at the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) executives&#x27; conference on 5 January 2007, he was notably absent at the Central Conference on Financial Affairs later on that month. Huang offered his condolences to late party elder Bo Yibo when Bo died, but did not attend the funeral as would have been expected of a Standing Committee member. Huang&#x27;s absence prompted speculation that his critical condition was preventing him from carrying out his official duties. Hong Kong media speculated that Huang was undergoing medical treatment in Shanghai. Huang appeared, looking frail, during the National People&#x27;s Congress in March 2007. The government denied Huang&#x27;s request to resign effective March 2007, but thereafter his position became entirely ceremonial. He handed over his role of oversight of the Financial Affairs portfolio to premier Wen Jiabao in January. Huang disappeared from public view in March 2007. Huang left Shanghai in April and was admitted to the 301 Military Hospital in Beijing, after which his health situation deteriorated.

Some media sources reported Huang&#x27;s death as early as May, though the initial reports turned out to be false. To reduce speculation, by 9 May, the authorities closed off the south-west wing of the 301 Military Hospital, and directed that all news related to Huang on television and on the internet follow official releases from official state news agency Xinhua.
 False reports of Huang&#x27;s death surfaced twice thereafter; some suggest his illness was used as an opportunity by internet users to vent about social and political problems. Despite his being incapacitated, Huang was elected as one of Shanghai&#x27;s local party representatives to the Party&#x27;s 17th Party Congress on 29 May.

== Death ==
On 2 June 2007, Huang Ju died in Beijing. In unprecedented fashion, the English and Chinese versions of his obituary were relayed simultaneously to the country and the world only a few hours after his death, at around 6:30 am Beijing time. Official Chinese news agency &quot;Xinhua&quot; reported that Huang had died at 2:03 am, of an unnamed illness, at age 68. His death was the top story on the national news program &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot;, where news anchors in black suits read off a dry and sober 155-word news item. The screen simply displayed &quot;Comrade Huang Ju has passed away.&quot;

In his concise official obituary, he was hailed as a &quot;long-tested and faithful Communist fighter and an outstanding leader of the party and the state.&quot; This posthumous designation was used for most of Communist China&#x27;s high-ranking leaders. The official state media called Huang an &quot;important member of the Central Committee Leadership under General Secretary Hu Jintao who dedicated his heart to the development of the Party and the State, and offered all of his intellectual strength and power for the cause.&quot; Former Party general secretary Jiang Zemin, in official footage, was in tears as he shook the hands of Huang&#x27;s widow Yu Huiwen.

Websites reporting Huang Ju&#x27;s death forbade discussions, and internet forums censored all negative comments and speculation about Huang Ju&#x27;s political life. In Shanghai, where Huang was one of the city&#x27;s former Mayors, reception of his death was cold. Among the mayors of Shanghai, Huang received the lowest ratings, while his contemporaries, Zhu Rongji and Xu Kuangdi, were more popular. There were no public displays of mourning in Shanghai.

Huang was the first PSC member to die in office since Chairman Mao himself in September 1976, some thirty years earlier, and the highest-ranking communist leader to die in office since economic reforms began in 1978. He was the only first vice premier ever to die in office.

===Funeral===
Huang&#x27;s funeral was notable as one of the highest-ranking ceremonies for the death of any Communist leader since Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s state funeral in 1997. It was the top story on CCTV&#x27;s &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot; national news broadcast at 7 pm on 5 June 2007, and occupied well over ten minutes of broadcast time in the half-hour program. Despite its priority and importance, however, Huang&#x27;s funeral was noticeably simpler than that of previous leaders. The official &quot;funeral&quot; (&quot;zhuidaohui&quot;; ) designation for deceased leaders was not used; rather, it was termed a &quot;send-off ceremony&quot; (&quot;gaobie yishi&quot;; ). Analysts suggested that Huang&#x27;s funeral may open the precedent for simple funerals for other deceased leaders. In a break with normally-strict rules of protocol, the funeral news coverage began with Zeng Qinghong standing at the hospital awaiting Huang Ju&#x27;s funeral procession, and not with Hu Jintao. All high-ranking Chinese leaders, including general secretary and president Hu Jintao, premier Wen Jiabao, former paramount leader and party leader Jiang Zemin, and former premier Zhu Rongji, attended the ceremony.

===Political impact===
Huang&#x27;s death opened a vacancy on the Politburo Standing Committee, which signaled an opportunity for the consolidation of Hu Jintao&#x27;s power during the 17th Party Congress held in October 2007. However, most observers believed Huang&#x27;s death would have a limited effect on Chinese politics, because Huang was absent from public life for over a year prior to his death. Huang&#x27;s seat on the PSC was left vacant until a newly minted PSC at 17th Party Congress, which saw Li Keqiang being slated to take over for the position of first-ranked vice premier; in the interim, Wu Yi took over some of Huang&#x27;s former responsibilities at the State Council as its vice premier.

Huang&#x27;s death was nevertheless seen as a major political blow to the Shanghai Clique, a loose grouping of senior officials with connections to Shanghai and rose to prominence in the footsteps of the political career of party leader Jiang Zemin. The Shanghai Clique reportedly often found themselves at odds with those officials more closely aligned with Hu Jintao. Huang, along with disgraced Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu, who was convicted and sent to prison on charges of fraud and corruption, were both seen as staunch political opponents of Hu and premier Wen Jiabao. Some commentators suggested that the timing of Huang&#x27;s death conveniently absolved himself of any responsibility in the Shanghai pension scandal and spared him and his family from political disgrace, thus avoiding any open splits in the Party&#x27;s top leadership.

==Legacy==
Huang Ju was officially eulogized with some of the highest honours given to deceased Communist Party officials, being called &quot;an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a long-tested faithful fighter of the Communist cause, and an extraordinary leader of the Party and State.&quot; Huang&#x27;s tenure in Shanghai was marked with high levels of economic growth and a dramatic transformation of the city&#x27;s skyline and urban infrastructure. Some Shanghai residents and political commentators suggest that Huang contributed significantly to the development of the Pudong area.

Huang faced significant criticism as well. Chinese-language media speculated that Huang provided &quot;political shelter&quot; for real estate mogul Zhou Zhengyi, allowing the latter a free hand in the forced eviction of local residents to pave way for his company&#x27;s construction projects. Zhou would eventually be sentenced to three years in prison on charges of securities fraud. The sentence, which was seen as extremely lenient by the standards of Chinese law, was allegedly due to pressure applied by Huang Ju on the city&#x27;s courts. Of the 42 major construction projects in the city during Huang&#x27;s tenure in Shanghai, seven was reportedly awarded to Zhou. In addition, according to &quot;Weiquan&quot; lawyer Zheng Enchong and a civil group representing those affected by forced evictions, Huang continued to unduly influence the proceedings of the Zhou case by impeding its further investigation.

Huang&#x27;s legacy was the subject of a photo collection book published by the Shanghai People&#x27;s Press in December 2012, entitled &quot;Huang Ju&quot;. The book&#x27;s title was inscribed with the calligraphy of Jiang Zemin. The book contained photos of Huang from his early years to his days as vice premier. Shanghai party chief Han Zheng attended the book launch event. The event signalled that Huang continued to be regarded positively in an official capacity.

==Personal==
Huang was married to Yu Huiwen (), who was an executive on a Shanghai Pensions board, and speculated to be involved in corruption cases in the city. 

In February 1995, his daughter, Daphne Huang (), married James Fang (), the son of Florence Fang ().

<text>Henning Georg Mankell (; 3 February 1948 – 5 October 2015) was a Swedish crime writer, children&#x27;s author, and dramatist, best known for a series of mystery novels starring his most noted creation, Inspector Kurt Wallander. He also wrote a number of plays and screenplays for television.

He was a left-wing social critic and activist. In his books and plays he constantly highlighted social inequality issues and injustices in Sweden and abroad. In 2010, Mankell was on board one of the ships in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla that was boarded by Israeli commandos. He was below deck on the MV Mavi Marmara when nine civilians were killed in international waters.

Mankell shared his time between Sweden and countries in Africa, mostly Mozambique where he started a theatre. He made considerable donations to charity organizations, mostly connected to Africa.

== Life and career ==
Mankell&#x27;s grandfather, also named Henning Mankell, lived from 1868 to 1930 and was a composer. Mankell was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1948. His father Ivar was a lawyer who divorced his mother when Mankell was one year old. He and an older sister lived with his father for most of their childhood. The family first lived in Sveg, Härjedalen in northern Sweden, where Mankell&#x27;s father was a district judge. In the biography on Mankell&#x27;s website, he describes this time when they lived in a flat above the court as one of the happiest in his life. In Sveg, a museum was built in his honour during his lifetime.

Later, when Mankell was thirteen, the family moved to Borås, Västergötland on the Swedish west coast near Gothenburg. After three years he dropped out of school and went to Paris when he was 16. Shortly afterwards he joined the merchant marine, working on a cargo ship and he &quot;loved the ship&#x27;s decent hard-working community&quot;. In 1966, he returned to Paris to become a writer. He took part in the student uprising of 1968. He later returned to work as a stagehand in Stockholm. At the age of 20, he had already started as author at the National Swedish Touring Theatre in Stockholm. In the following years he collaborated with several theatres in Sweden. His first play, &quot;The Amusement Park&quot; dealt with Swedish colonialism in South America. In 1973, he published &quot;The Stone Blaster&quot;, a novel about the Swedish labour movement. He used the proceeds from the novel to travel to Guinea-Bissau. Africa would later become a second home to him, and he spent a big part of his life there. When his success as a writer made it possible, he founded and ran a theatre in Mozambique.

From 1991 to 2013, Mankell wrote the books which made him famous worldwide, the Kurt Wallander mystery novels. Wallander was a fictional detective living in Ystad in southern Sweden, who supervised a squad of detectives in solving murders, some of which were bizarre. As they worked to catch a killer who had to be stopped before he could kill again, the team often worked late into the nights in a heightened atmosphere of tension and crisis. Wallander&#x27;s thoughts and worries about his daughter, his health, his lack of friends and a social life, his worries about Swedish society, shared his mental life with his many concerns and worries about the case he was working. There were ten books in the series. They were translated into many languages and sold millions of copies worldwide. The series gave Mankell the freedom and wherewithal to pursue other projects which interested him.

After living in Zambia and other African countries, Mankell was invited from 1986 onward to become the artistic director of Teatro Avenida in Maputo, Mozambique. He subsequently spent extended periods in Maputo working with the theatre and as a writer. He built his own publishing house, &quot;Leopard Förlag&quot;, in order to support young talented writers from Africa and Sweden. His novel &quot;Chronicler of the Winds&quot;, published in Sweden as &quot;Comédie infantil&quot; in 1995, reflects African problems and is based on African storytelling. On 12June 2008, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate from the University of St Andrews in Scotland &quot;in recognition of his major contribution to literature and to the practical exercise of conscience&quot;.

Around 2008, Mankell developed two original stories for the German police series &quot;Tatort&quot;. Actor Axel Milberg, who portrays Inspector Klaus Borowski, had asked Mankell to contribute to the show when they were promoting &quot;The Man from Beijing&quot; audiobook, a project that Milberg had worked on. The episodes were scheduled to broadcast in Germany in 2010. In 2010, Mankell was set to work on a screenplay for Sveriges Television about his father-in-law, movie and theatre director Ingmar Bergman, on a series produced in four one-hour episodes. Mankell pitched the project to Sveriges Television and production was planned for 2011.
At the time of his death, Mankell had written over 40 novels that had sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.

== Personal life ==
Mankell was married four times and had four sons, Thomas, Marius, Morten and Jon, by different relationships. In 1998 he married Eva Bergman, daughter of film director Ingmar Bergman. They remained married until his death in 2015.

== Death ==
In January 2014, Mankell announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and throat cancer. In May 2014, he reported that treatments had worked well and he was getting better.

He wrote a series of articles inspired by his wife Eva, describing his situation, how it felt to be diagnosed, how it felt to be supported, how it felt to wait, and after his first chemotherapy at Sahlgrenska University Hospital about the importance of cancer research. Three weeks before his death he wrote about what happens to people&#x27;s identity when they are stricken by a serious illness. His last post was published posthumously 6 October.

On 5October 2015, Mankell died at the age of 67, almost two years after having been diagnosed.

== Political views ==

In his youth Mankell was a left-wing political activist and participated in the Protests of 1968 in Sweden, protesting against, among other things, the Vietnam War, the Portuguese Colonial War, and the apartheid regime in South Africa. Furthermore, he got involved with &quot;Folket i Bild/Kulturfront&quot; which focused on cultural policy studies. In the 1970s, Mankell moved from Sweden to Norway and lived with a Norwegian woman who was a member of the Maoist Workers&#x27; Communist Party. He took an active part in their activities but did not join the party.

In 2002, Mankell gave financial support by buying stocks for 50,000 NOK in the Norwegian left-wing newspaper &quot;Klassekampen&quot;. In 2009, Mankell was a guest at the Palestine Festival of Literature. He said he had seen &quot;repetition of the despicable apartheid system that once treated Africans and coloured as second-class citizens in their own country&quot;. He found a resemblance between the Israeli West Bank barrier and the Berlin Wall: &quot;The wall that is currently dividing the country will prevent future attacks, in short term. In the end, it will face the same destiny as the wall that once divided Berlin did.&quot; Considering the environment the Palestinian people live in, he continued: &quot;Is it strange that some of them in pure desperation, when they cannot see any other way out, decide to become suicide bombers? Not really? Maybe it is strange that there are not more of them.&quot;

Mankell stated in an interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot; that he did not support Hezbollah. In Mankell&#x27;s opinion the state of Israel should not have a future as a two-state solution and this &quot;will not be the end of the historical occupation&quot;. He said he did not encounter antisemitism during his journey, just &quot;hatred against the occupants that is completely normal and understandable&quot;, and said that &quot;to keep these two things separate is crucial&quot;.

=== Gaza flotilla ===

In 2010, Henning Mankell was on board the &quot;MS Sofia&quot;, one of the boats which took part in the flotilla which tried to break the Israeli embargo of the Gaza strip. Following the Israel Defense Forces&#x27; boarding of the flotilla on the morning of 31May 2010, Mankell was deported to Sweden. He subsequently called for global sanctions against Israel. In 2010 it was reported that he was considering halting Hebrew translations of his books. In June 2011, Mankell stated in an article in the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; that he had never considered preventing his books from being translated into Hebrew, and that unidentified persons had stolen his identity to make this false claim.

Mankell was supposed to be one of twenty Swedish participants in &quot;Freedom Flotilla II&quot; which never took place. It was originally scheduled to sail to Gaza in June 2011.

== Charity and legacy ==

In 2007, Henning Mankell donated 15 million Swedish crowns (about 1.5 million euros) to SOS Children&#x27;s Villages for a children&#x27;s village in Chimoio in western Mozambique. Mankell donated vast amounts of money to charitable organizations such as SOS Children&#x27;s Villages and Hand in Hand, a collection of independent organizations.

In the 1980s, Mankell visited United Nations refugee camps in Mozambique and later accompanied UN High Commissioner Sadako Ogata to refugee camps in South Africa. In 2013, he visited Congolese refugees in Uganda. He wrote on the plight of refugees and after his death his website asked for donations in his name to the UN Commission on Refugees.

The theme for short stories submitted to the inaugural Festival Fim do Caminho Literary Prize, &quot;Crime in Mozambique&quot;, was chosen in homage to Mankell.

== Works ==

=== Wallander series ===

Kurt Wallander is a fictional police inspector living and working in Ystad, Sweden. In the novels, he solves shocking murders with his colleagues. The novels have an underlying question: &quot;What went wrong with Swedish society?&quot;

The series has won many awards, including the German Crime Prize and the British 2001 CWA Gold Dagger for &quot;Sidetracked&quot; (1995).

The ninth book, &quot;The Pyramid&quot; (1999), is a prequel about Wallander&#x27;s past, covering the time until just before the start of &quot;Faceless Killers&quot; (1991). It includes a collection of five novellas:
*&quot;Wallander&#x27;s First Case&quot;
*&quot;The Man with the Mask&quot;
*&quot;The Man on the Beach&quot;
*&quot;The Death of the Photographer&quot;
*&quot;The Pyramid&quot;

Ten years after &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, Mankell published another Wallander novel, &quot;The Troubled Man&quot; (2009), which he said would definitely be the last in the series.

Linda is the daughter of Kurt Wallander, who follows in his footsteps as a police officer. Mankell began an intended trilogy of novels with her as the protagonist. However, following the suicide of Johanna Sällström, the actress playing the character at the time in the Swedish TV series, Mankell was so distraught that he decided to abandon the series after only the first novel.

<doc id="259071" wikidata="Q5869233" url="?curid=259071" title="History of the Church of England">
<text>The Church of England traces its history back to 597. That year, a group of missionaries sent by the pope and led by Augustine of Canterbury began the Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons. Augustine became the first archbishop of Canterbury. Throughout the Middle Ages, the English Church was a part of the Catholic Church led by the pope in Rome. Over the years, the church won many legal privileges and amassed vast wealth and property. This was often a point of contention between Kings of England and the church.

During the 16th-century English Reformation, which began under Henry VIII (), papal authority was abolished in England and the king became Supreme Head of the Church of England. Henry dissolved the monasteries and confiscated their assets. The church was briefly reunited with Rome during the reign of Mary I (1553–1558) but separated once again under Elizabeth I (). The Elizabethan Religious Settlement established the Church of England as a conservative Protestant church. During this time, the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was authorised as the church&#x27;s official liturgy and the Thirty-nine Articles as a doctrinal statement. These continue to be important expressions of Anglicanism.

The Settlement failed to end religious disputes. While most of the population gradually conformed to the established church, a minority of recusants remained loyal Roman Catholics. Within the Church of England, Puritans pressed to remove what they considered papist abuses from the church&#x27;s liturgy and to replace bishops with a presbyterian system in which all ministers were equal. After Elizabeth&#x27;s death, the Puritans were challenged by a high church, Arminian party that gained power during the reign of Charles I (1625–1649). The English Civil War and overthrow of the monarchy allowed the Puritans to pursue their reform agenda and the dismantling of the Elizabethan Settlement. After the Restoration in 1660, Puritans were forced out of the Church of England. Anglicans started defining their church as a &quot;via media&quot; or middle way between the religious extremes of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism; Arminianism and Calvinism; and high church and low church.

In the 1700s and 1800s, revival movements contributed to the rise of Evangelical Anglicanism. In the 19th century, the Oxford Movement gave rise to Anglo-Catholicism, a movement that emphasises the Church of England&#x27;s Catholic heritage. As the British Empire grew, Anglican churches were established in other parts of the world. These churches consider the Church of England to be a mother church, and it maintains a leading role in the Anglican Communion.

For a general history of Christianity in England, see History of Christianity in Britain.

==Middle Ages==
=== Anglo-Saxon period (597–1065) ===

There is evidence for Christianity in Roman Britain as early as the 3rd century. After 380, Christianity was the official religion of the Roman Empire, and there was some sort of formal church organisation in Britain led by bishops. In the 5th century, the end of Roman rule and invasions by Germanic pagans led to the destruction of any formal church organisation in England. The new inhabitants, the Anglo-Saxons, introduced Anglo-Saxon paganism, and the Christian church was confined to Wales and Cornwall. In Ireland, Celtic Christianity continued to thrive.

The Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons began in 597 when Pope Gregory I dispatched the Gregorian Mission to convert the Kingdom of Kent. The mission&#x27;s leader, Augustine, became the first archbishop of Canterbury. The conversion of northern England was aided by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, which promoted Celtic Christianity in contrast to the Latin Christianity of the Gregorian Mission.

The Celtic and Roman churches disagreed on several issues. The most important was the date of Easter. There were other differences over baptismal customs and the style of tonsure worn by monks. To settle the matter of which tradition Northumbria would follow, King Oswiu summoned the Synod of Whitby in 664. After hearing arguments from both sides, the king decided in favor of the Roman tradition, as this was followed by the successors of Saint Peter.

In the late 8th century, Viking raids had a devastating impact on the church in northern and eastern England. Monasteries and churches were raided for wealth in the form of golden crosses, altar plate, and jewels decorating relics and illuminated Bibles. Eventually, the raids turned into wars of conquest and the kingdoms of Northumbria, East Anglia, and parts of Mercia became the Danelaw, whose rulers were Scandinavian pagans. Alfred the Great of Wessex () and his successors led the Anglo-Saxon resistance and reconquest, culminating in the formation of a single Kingdom of England.

==== Early organization ====
Under papal authority, the English church was divided into two ecclesiastical provinces, each led by a metropolitan or archbishop. In the south, the Province of Canterbury was led by the archbishop of Canterbury. It was originally to be based at London, but Augustine and his successors remained at Canterbury instead. In the north, the Province of York was led by the archbishop of York. Theoretically, neither archbishop had precedence over the other. In reality, the south was wealthier than the north, and the result was that Canterbury dominated.

In 668, Theodore of Tarsus became archbishop of Canterbury. He reformed many aspects of the church&#x27;s administration. At the Synod of Hertford in 672, canons were adopted to promote greater uniformity, among these that the English bishops should hold an annual council at Clovesho.

A major reorganisation of the English church occurred the late 700s. King Offa of Mercia wanted his own kingdom to have an archbishop since the archbishop of Canterbury was also a great Kentish magnate. In 787, a council of the English church attended by two papal legates elevated the Diocese of Lichfield into an archbishopric. There were now three provinces in England: York, Lichfield and Canterbury. However, this arrangement was abandoned in 803, and Lichfield was reabsorbed into the Province of Canterbury.

Initially, the diocese was the only administrative unit in the Anglo-Saxon church. The bishop served the diocese from a cathedral town with the help of a group of priests known as the bishop&#x27;s &quot;familia&quot;. These priests would baptise, teach and visit the remoter parts of the diocese. &quot;Familiae&quot; were placed in other important settlements, and these were called minsters. Most villages would have had a church by 1042, as the parish system developed as an outgrowth of manorialism. The parish church was a private church built and endowed by the lord of the manor, who retained the right to nominate the parish priest. The priest supported himself by farming his glebe and was also entitled to other support from parishioners. The most important was the tithe, the right to collect one-tenth of all produce from land or animals. Originally, the tithe was a voluntary gift, but the church successfully made it a compulsory tax by the 10th century.

In the late 10th century, the Benedictine Reform movement helped to restore monasticism in England after the Viking attacks of the 9th century. The most prominent reformers were Archbishop Dunstan of Canterbury (959–988), Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester (963–984), and Archbishop Oswald of York (971–992). The reform movement was supported by King Edgar (). One result of the reforms was the creation of monastic cathedrals at Canterbury, Worcester, Winchester, and Sherborne. These were staffed by cloistered monks, while other cathedrals were staffed by secular clergy called canons. By 1066, there were over 45 monasteries in England, and monks were chosen as bishops more often than in other parts of western Europe.

By 1000, there were eighteen dioceses in England: Canterbury, Rochester, London, Winchester, Dorchester, Ramsbury, Sherborne, Selsey, Lichfield, Hereford, Worcester, Crediton, Cornwall, Elmham, Lindsey, Wells, York and Durham. To assist bishops in supervising the parishes and monasteries within their dioceses, the office of archdeacon was created. Once a year, the bishop would summon parish priests to the cathedral for a synod.

Royal authority and ecclesiastical authority were mutually reinforcing. Through the coronation ritual, the church invested the monarch with sacred authority. In return, the church expected royal protection. In addition, the church was a wealthy institution—owning 25–33% of all land according to the Domesday Book. This meant that bishops and abbots had the same status as secular magnates, and it was vital that king&#x27;s appointed loyal men to these influential offices.

During the Anglo-Saxon period, kings were able to &quot;govern the church largely unimpeded&quot; by appointing bishops and abbots. Bishops were chosen by the king and tended to be recruited from among royal chaplains or monasteries. The bishop-elect was then presented at a synod where clerical approval was obtained and consecration followed. The appointment of an archbishop was more complicated and required approval from the pope. The archbishop of Canterbury had to travel to Rome to receive the pallium, his symbol of office. These visits to Rome and the payments that accompanied them (such as Peter&#x27;s Pence) was a point of contention.

=== Post-Conquest (1066–1500) ===

In 1066, William, Duke of Normandy, invaded England claiming he was the rightful heir to Edward the Confessor. He appealed to Pope Alexander II who gave his blessing and ordered English clergy to submit to William&#x27;s authority. At the time of the Norman Conquest, there were only 15 diocesan bishops in England, increased to 17 in the 12th century with the creation of the sees of Ely and Carlisle. This is far fewer than the numbers in France and Italy. A further four medieval dioceses in Wales came within the Province of Canterbury.

The Norman Conquest led to the replacement of the old Anglo-Saxon elite by a new ruling class of Anglo-Normans in both the secular nobility as well as the episcopate. In 1070, three papal legates arrived to oversee the reform of the English church. At a council held at Winchester, Archbishop Stigand of Canterbury, his brother Bishop Æthelmær of Elmham, and the married Bishop Leofwin of Lichfield were deprived of office. At a later council at Windsor, Bishop Æthelric of Selsey was also deprived of his office. Another bishop, Æthelwine of Durham, lost his see when he was declared an outlaw and imprisoned by the king. By the end of the year, there were only two Anglo-Saxon bishops left: Siward of Rochester and Saint Wulfstan of Worcester. Thereafter, William was able to fill the English sees with reformists such as Lanfranc of Bec for Canterbury and Thomas of Bayeux for York. He continued the English custom of recruiting bishops from the royal household and chapel.

In 1072, William and his archbishop, Lanfranc, sought to complete the programme of reform begun by Archbishop Dunstan. Durham and Rochester cathedrals were refounded as Benedictine monasteries, the secular cathedral of Wells was moved to monastic Bath, while the secular cathedral of Lichfield was moved to Chester, and then to monastic Coventry. Norman bishops were seeking to establish an endowment income entirely separate from that of their cathedral body, and this was inherently more difficult in a monastic cathedral, where the bishop was also titular abbot. Hence, following Lanfranc&#x27;s death in 1090, a number of bishops took advantage of the vacancy to obtain secular constitutions for their cathedrals – Lincoln, Sarum, Chichester, Exeter and Hereford; while the major urban cathedrals of London and York always remained secular. Furthermore, when the bishops&#x27; seats were transferred back from Coventry to Lichfield, and from Bath to Wells, these sees reverted to being secular. Bishops of monastic cathedrals, tended to find themselves embroiled in long-running legal disputes with their respective monastic bodies; and increasingly tended to reside elsewhere. The bishops of Ely and Winchester lived in London as did the archbishop of Canterbury. The bishops of Worcester generally lived in York, while the bishops of Carlisle lived at Melbourne in Derbyshire. Monastic governance of cathedrals continued in England, Scotland and Wales throughout the medieval period; whereas elsewhere in western Europe it was found only at Monreale in Sicily and Downpatrick in Ireland.

As in other parts of medieval Europe, tension existed between the local monarch and the Pope about civil judicial authority over clerics, taxes and the wealth of the Church, and appointments of bishops, notably during the reigns of Henry II and John (see Investiture Controversy).

An important aspect in the practice of medieval Christianity was the veneration of saints, and the associated pilgrimages to places where the relics of a particular saint were interred and the saint&#x27;s tradition honoured. The possession of the relics of a popular saint was a source of funds to the individual church as the faithful made donations and benefactions in the hope that they might receive spiritual aid, a blessing or a healing from the presence of the physical remains of the holy person. Among those churches to benefit in particular were: St. Alban&#x27;s Abbey, which contained the relics of England&#x27;s first Christian martyr; Ripon, with the shrine of its founder St. Wilfrid; Durham, which was built to house the body of Saints Cuthbert of Lindisfarne and Aidan; Ely, with the shrine of St. Etheldreda; Westminster Abbey, with the shrine of its founder St. Edward the Confessor; and Chichester, which held the honoured remains of St. Richard. All these saints brought pilgrims to their churches, but among them the most renowned was Thomas Becket, the late archbishop of Canterbury, who was assassinated by henchmen of King Henry II in 1170. As a place of pilgrimage Canterbury was, in the 13th century, second only to Santiago de Compostela.

John Wycliffe (about 1320 – 31 December 1384) was an English theologian and an early dissident against the Roman Catholic Church during the 14th century. He founded the Lollard movement, which opposed a number of practices of the church. He was also against papal encroachments on secular power. Wycliffe was associated with statements indicating that the Church of Rome is not the head of all churches, nor did St Peter have any more powers given to him than other disciples. These statements were related to his call for a reformation of its wealth, corruption and abuses. Wycliffe, an Oxford scholar, went so far as to state that &quot;The Gospel by itself is a rule sufficient to rule the life of every Christian person on the earth, without any other rule.&quot; The Lollard movement continued with his pronouncements from pulpits even under the persecution that followed with Henry IV up to and including the early years of the reign of Henry VIII.

== Reformation (1509–1603) ==
===Henry VIII (1509–1547)===

Catholicism taught that the contrite person could cooperate with God towards their salvation by performing good works (see synergism). God&#x27;s grace was given through the seven sacraments—baptism, confirmation, marriage, ordination, anointing of the sick, penance and the Eucharist. The Eucharist was celebrated during the Mass, the central act of Catholic worship. In this service, a priest consecrated bread and wine to become the body and blood of Christ through transubstantiation. The Church taught that, in the name of the congregation, the priest offered to God the same sacrifice of Christ on the cross that provided atonement for the sins of humanity. The Mass was also an offering of prayer by which the living could help souls in purgatory. While penance removed the guilt attached to sin, Catholicism taught that a penalty still remained. It was believed that most people would end their lives with these penalties unsatisfied and would have to spend time in purgatory. Time in purgatory could be lessened through indulgences and prayers for the dead, which were made possible by the communion of saints.

In the late Middle Ages, Catholicism was an essential part of English life and culture. The 9,000 parishes covering all of England were overseen by a hierarchy of deaneries, archdeaconries, dioceses led by bishops, and ultimately the pope who presided over the Catholic Church from Rome.

This connection to Rome was severed during the reign of Henry VIII. Desperate for a male heir, the king sought papal consent to annul his marriage to Catharine of Aragon, freeing him to marry Anne Boleyn. When the pope refused his request, Henry launched a campaign to strip the papacy of any authority in England. Under intense pressure, the Convocation of Canterbury renounced its authority to make canon law without royal approval in the 1532 Submission of the Clergy. In 1533, Parliament passed the Act in Restraint of Appeals, barring legal cases from being appealed outside England. This allowed the archbishop of Canterbury to annul the marriage without reference to Rome. In November 1534, the Act of Supremacy formally abolished papal authority in England and declared Henry Supreme Head of the Church of England. The majority of English clergy were intimidated or bribed into acquiescing with the separation.

People supported the separation for different reasons. Important clergy, such as Bishop Stephen Gardiner, believed their loyalty belonged to the English king rather than a foreign pope. Christian humanists argued that papal supremacy was a recent historical development and was therefore not essential to the church&#x27;s identity. The gentry and nobility wanted to diminish the power of the clergy. The king ordered the dissolution of the monasteries, confiscating the enormous wealth of these church institutions. Henry then granted or sold much of the land to laymen, ensuring these men would support the break with Rome out of financial interest.

But the most important constituency backing royal supremacy were followers of a new movement—Protestantism. The Protestant Reformation was initiated by a German monk named Martin Luther. The main plank of Luther&#x27;s theology was justification by faith alone rather than by good works. In this view, God&#x27;s unmerited favour is the only way for humans to be justified—it cannot be achieved or earned by righteous living. In other words, justification is a gift from God received through faith. If Luther was correct, then the Mass, the sacraments, charitable acts, prayers to saints, prayers for the dead, pilgrimage, and the veneration of relics do not mediate divine favor. To believe they can would be superstition at best and idolatry at worst. Not only did purgatory lack any biblical basis according to Protestants, but the clergy were accused of using fear of purgatory to make money from prayers and masses. Catholics countered that justification by faith alone was a &quot;licence to sin&quot;.

Protestantism had made inroads in England from 1520 onwards, but Protestants had been a persecuted minority considered heretics by both church and state. By 1534, they were Henry&#x27;s greatest allies. He even chose the Protestant Thomas Cranmer to be archbishop of Canterbury in 1533.

In 1536, the king first exercised his power to pronounce doctrine. That year, the Ten Articles became the first doctrinal statement of the Church of England. It kept most of the traditional Catholic doctrines and practices (purgatory, veneration of saints, and the real presence), but it also contained Lutheran teachings (justification by faith and three instead of seven sacraments). Under Thomas Cromwell, the King&#x27;s vicegerent in spirituals, relics and images of saints were declared to be superstition. Between 1536 and 1538, iconoclasm was condoned by the government. By 1539, a traditionalist counterreaction began. Parliament passed the Six Articles, which reinforced the medieval heresy laws and silenced opposition to traditional doctrines such as transubstantiation.

===Edward VI and Mary I (1547–1558)===
Henry&#x27;s son, Edward VI (), became king at the age of nine. Under the guidance of Protestant councilors, including Cranmer, the Church of England was transformed into a fully Protestant Church. A &quot;Book of Homilies&quot; was published, from which all clergy were to preach on Sundays. The homilies condemned relics, images, rosary beads, holy water, palms, and other &quot;papistical superstitions&quot;. It also taught justification by faith alone. Government sanctioned iconoclasm led to the destruction of images and relics. Stained glass, shrines, statues, and roods were defaced or destroyed. Church walls were whitewashed and covered with biblical texts condemning idolatry. The Chantries Act 1547 abolished the chantries and confiscated their assets. A chantry was an endowment that paid priests to say mass for the dead for the purpose of aiding souls in purgatory.

The most significant reform in Edward&#x27;s reign was the adoption of an English liturgy to replace the old Latin rites. The doctrine of justification by faith is implicit throughout the 1549 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, but the Catholic doctrines of transubstantiation and the sacrifice of the Mass are rejected. Nevertheless, many reformers complained that the prayer book was too traditional. The 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was explicitly Protestant, going so far as to deny the real presence. John Hooper refused to be consecrated a bishop while wearing the required vestments (a black chimere over a white rochet) igniting the first vestments controversy, which was essentially a conflict over whether the Church could require people to observe ceremonies that were neither necessary for salvation nor prohibited by scripture.

In June 1553, the Church promulgated a Protestant doctrinal statement, the Forty-Two Articles. It affirmed predestination and denied the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. However, three weeks later Edward was dead.

Following the death of Edward, his half-sister the Roman Catholic Mary I () came to the throne. She reversed the religious policies of her father and brother and re-established unity with Rome. The Marian Persecutions of Protestants and dissenters took place at this time. The queen&#x27;s image after the persecutions turned into that of an almost legendary tyrant called Bloody Mary. This perception was mainly due to the widespread publication of &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot; after her death. Nigel Heard summarises the persecution thus: &quot;It is now estimated that the 274 religious executions carried out during the last three years of Mary&#x27;s reign exceeded the number recorded in any Catholic country on the continent in the same period.&quot;

=== Elizabeth I (1558–1603) ===
When Queen Mary died childless in November 1558, her half-sister became Queen Elizabeth I. The first task was to settle England&#x27;s religious conflicts. The Elizabethan Religious Settlement established how the Church of England would worship and how it was to be governed. In essence, the Church was returned to where it stood in 1553 before Edward&#x27;s death. The Act of Supremacy made the monarch the Church&#x27;s supreme governor. The Act of Uniformity restored a slightly altered 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

Clergy faced fines and imprisonment for refusing to use the liturgy. As Roman Catholics, all the bishops except one refused to swear the Oath of Supremacy and were deprived of office. Recusants were Roman Catholics who refused to attend Church of England services as required by law. Recusancy was punishable by fines of £20 a month (fifty times an artisan&#x27;s wage). &quot;Church papists&quot; were Roman Catholics who outwardly conformed to the established church while maintaining their Catholic faith in secret. Gradually, England was transformed into a Protestant country as the prayer book shaped Elizabethan religious life. By the end of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, most people were Protestants, and Roman Catholicism was &quot;the faith of a small sect&quot;, largely confined to gentry households.

The Thirty-nine Articles were produced by the Convocation of 1563 as a revision of the Forty-two Articles issued before Edward&#x27;s death. The Queen vetoed Article 29, which stated that even though wicked and unworthy communicants consumed the bread and wine in the Lord&#x27;s Supper, they were not &quot;partakers of Christ&quot;. This was a point of disagreement between Calvinists and Lutherans, and Article 29 affirmed the Calvinist view. In 1563, however, Elizabeth was concerned that such a theological slight would hurt diplomatic ties with Lutheran nations. She may also have been personally sympathetic to the Lutheran view. Nevertheless, this article was later restored, and the Thirty-Nine Articles were given parliamentary approval in 1571.

The settlement ensured the Church of England was definitively Protestant, but it was unclear what kind of Protestantism was being adopted. It did not help matters that royal injunctions issued in 1559 sometimes contradicted the prayer book. The injunctions specified traditional communion wafers should be used for Holy Communion even though the prayer book said to use regular bread. There was also confusion over the location and positioning of the communion tables. According to the injunctions when not being used for communion, the tables were to be moved where the stone altars once stood.

The prayer book&#x27;s eucharistic theology was vague. The words of administration neither affirmed nor denied the real presence. Perhaps, a spiritual presence was implied, since Article 28 of the Thirty-nine Articles taught that the body of Christ was eaten &quot;only after an heavenly and spiritual manner&quot;. Nevertheless, there was enough ambiguity to allow later theologians to articulate various versions of Anglican eucharistic theology.

A Calvinist consensus prevailed among leading churchmen during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. Most Calvinists were willing to conform to the terms of the religious settlement. Others wanted further reforms to make the Church of England more like the Continental Reformed churches. These nonconformist Calvinists became known as Puritans. Some Puritans refused to bow at the name of Jesus, to make the sign of the cross in baptism, use wedding rings or organ music in church. They especially resented the requirement that clergy wear the white surplice and clerical cap. Puritan clergymen preferred to wear black academic attire (see Vestments controversy). Many Puritans believed the Church of England should follow the example of Reformed churches in other parts of Europe and adopt presbyterian polity, under which government by bishops would be replaced with government by elders. But all attempts to enact further reforms through Parliament were blocked by the Queen.

Conformists, such as John Bridges and John Whitgift, agreed with Puritans, like Thomas Cartwright, on the doctrines of predestination and election, but they resented Puritans for obsessing over minor ceremonies. There were anti-Calvinists, such as Benjamin Carier and Humphrey Leech. However, criticism of Calvinism was suppressed.

== Stuart period (1603 to 1714) ==

===James I (1603–1625)===

In 1603, the King of Scotland inherited the English crown as James I. The Church of Scotland was even more strongly Reformed, having a presbyterian polity and John Knox&#x27;s liturgy, the &quot;Book of Common Order&quot;. James was himself a moderate Calvinist, and the Puritans hoped the King would move the English Church in the Scottish direction. James, however, did the opposite, forcing the Scottish Church to accept bishops and the Five Articles of Perth, all attempts to make it as similar as possible to the English Church.

At the start of his reign, Puritans presented the Millenary Petition to the King. This petition for church reform was referred to the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, which agreed to produce a new version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; that incorporated a few changes requested by the Puritans. The most important outcome of the Conference, however, was the decision to produce a new translation of the Bible, the 1611 King James Version. While a disappointment for Puritans, the provisions were aimed at satisfying moderate Puritans and isolating them from their more radical counterparts.

The Church of England&#x27;s dominant theology was still Calvinism, but a group of theologians associated with Bishop Lancelot Andrewes disagreed with many aspects of the Reformed tradition, especially its teaching on predestination. Like the Puritans, Andrewes engaged in his own brand of nonconformity. In his private chapel, he added ceremonies and formulas not authorised in the prayer book, such as burning incense. James I tried to balance the Puritan forces within his church with followers of Andrewes, promoting many of them at the end of his reign. This group was led by Richard Neile of Durham and became known as the Durham House group. They looked to the Church Fathers rather than the Reformers and preferred using the more traditional 1549 prayer book. Due to their belief in free will, this new faction is known as the Arminian party, but their high church orientation was more controversial.

=== English Civil War ===


For the next century, through the reigns of James I and Charles I, and culminating in the English Civil War and the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, there were significant swings back and forth between two factions: the Puritans (and other radicals) who sought more far-reaching reform, and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and practices. The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By continental standards the level of violence over religion was not high, but the casualties included a king, Charles I and an archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud. For about a decade (1647–1660), Christmas was another casualty as Parliament abolished all feasts and festivals of the Church to rid England of outward signs of &quot;Popishness&quot;. Under the Protectorate of the Commonwealth of England from 1649 to 1660, Anglicanism was disestablished, presbyterian ecclesiology was introduced as an adjunct to the Episcopal system, the Articles were replaced with a non-Presbyterian version of the Westminster Confession (1647), and the Book of Common Prayer was replaced by the Directory of Public Worship.

Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform. In the midst of the apparent triumph of Calvinism, the 17th century brought forth a Golden Age of Anglicanism. The Caroline Divines, such as Andrewes, Laud, Herbert Thorndike, Jeremy Taylor, John Cosin, Thomas Ken and others rejected Roman claims and refused to adopt the ways and beliefs of the Continental Protestants. The historic episcopate was preserved. Truth was to be found in Scripture and the bishops and archbishops, which were to be bound to the traditions of the first four centuries of the Church&#x27;s history. The role of reason in theology was affirmed.

=== Restoration ===
With the Restoration of Charles II, Anglicanism too was restored in a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned. The 1662 revision of the Book of Common Prayer became the unifying text of the ruptured and repaired Church after the disaster that was the civil war.

When the new king Charles II reached the throne in 1660, he restored priests who had been expelled from their benefices and actively appointed his supporters who had resisted Cromwell to vacancies. He translated the leading supporters to the most prestigious and rewarding sees. He also considered the need to reestablish episcopal authority and to reincorporate &quot;moderate dissenters&quot; in order to effect Protestant reconciliation. In some cases turnover was heavy—he made four appointments to the diocese of Worcester in four years 1660–63, moving the first three up to better positions.

James II was overthrown by William of Orange in 1688, and the new king moved quickly to ease religious tensions. Many of his supporters had been English Dissenters or Nonconformist non-Anglicans. With the Act of Toleration enacted on 24 May 1689, Nonconformists had freedom of worship. That is, those Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists, Congregationalists and Quakers were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers and preachers, subject to acceptance of certain oaths of allegiance. These privileges expressly did not apply to Catholics and Unitarians, and it continued the existing social and political disabilities for dissenters, including exclusion from political office. The religious settlement of 1689 shaped policy down to the 1830s. The Church of England was not only dominant in religious affairs, but it blocked outsiders from responsible positions in national and local government, business, professions and academe. In practice, the doctrine of the divine right of kings persisted Old animosities had diminished, and a new spirit of toleration was abroad. Restrictions on Nonconformists were mostly either ignored or slowly lifted. The Protestants, including the Quakers, who worked to overthrow King James II were rewarded. Toleration Act 1688 allowed nonconformists who have their own chapels, teachers, and preachers, censorship was relaxed. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with an Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and Roman Catholics and those Puritans who dissented from the establishment, too strong to be suppressed altogether, having to continue their existence outside the national church rather than controlling it.

== 18th century ==

=== Spread of Anglicanism outside England ===


The history of Anglicanism since the 17th century has been one of greater geographical and cultural expansion and diversity, accompanied by a concomitant diversity of liturgical and theological profession and practice.

At the same time as the English reformation, the Church of Ireland was separated from Rome and adopted articles of faith similar to England&#x27;s Thirty-Nine Articles. However, unlike England, the Anglican church there was never able to capture the loyalty of the majority of the population (who still adhered to Roman Catholicism). As early as 1582, the Scottish Episcopal Church was inaugurated when James VI of Scotland sought to reintroduce bishops when the Church of Scotland became fully presbyterian (see Scottish reformation). The Scottish Episcopal Church enabled the creation of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America after the American Revolution, by consecrating in Aberdeen the first American bishop, Samuel Seabury, who had been refused consecration by bishops in England, due to his inability to take the oath of allegiance to the English crown prescribed in the Order for the Consecration of Bishops. The polity and ecclesiology of the Scottish and American churches, as well as their daughter churches, thus tends to be distinct from those spawned by the English church—reflected, for example, in their looser conception of provincial government, and their leadership by a presiding bishop or primus rather than by a metropolitan or archbishop. The names of the Scottish and American churches inspire the customary term &quot;Episcopalian&quot; for an Anglican; the term being used in these and other parts of the world.
At the time of the English Reformation the four (now six) Welsh dioceses were all part of the Province of Canterbury and remained so until 1920 when the Church in Wales was created as a province of the Anglican Communion. The intense interest in the Christian faith which characterised the Welsh in the 18th and 19th centuries was not present in the sixteenth and most Welsh people went along with the church&#x27;s reformation more because the English government was strong enough to impose its wishes in Wales rather than out of any real conviction.

Anglicanism spread outside of the British Isles by means of emigration as well as missionary effort. The 1609 wreck of the flagship of the Virginia Company, the Sea Venture, resulted in the settlement of Bermuda by that Company. This was made official in 1612, when the town of St George&#x27;s, now the oldest surviving English settlement in the New World, was established. It is the location of St Peter&#x27;s Church, the oldest-surviving Anglican church outside the British Isles (Britain and Ireland), and the oldest surviving non-Roman Catholic church in the New World, also established in 1612. It remained part of the Church of England until 1978, when the Anglican Church of Bermuda separated. The Church of England was the state religion in Bermuda and a system of parishes was set up for the religious and political subdivision of the colony (they survive, today, as both civil and religious parishes). Bermuda, like Virginia, tended to the Royalist side during the Civil War. The conflict in Bermuda resulted in the expulsion of Independent Puritans from the island (the Eleutheran Adventurers, who settled Eleuthera, in the Bahamas). The church in Bermuda, before the Civil War, had a somewhat Presbyterian flavour, but mainstream Anglicanism was asserted afterwards (although Bermuda is also home to the oldest Presbyterian church outside the British Isles). Bermudians were required by law in the 17th century to attend Church of England services, and proscriptions similar to those in England existed on other denominations.

English missionary organisations such as USPG—then known as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and the Church Missionary Society (CMS) were established in the 17th and 18th centuries to bring Anglican Christianity to the British colonies. By the 19th century, such missions were extended to other areas of the world. The liturgical and theological orientations of these missionary organisations were diverse. The SPG, for example, was in the 19th century influenced by the Catholic Revival in the Church of England, while the CMS was influenced by the Evangelicalism of the earlier Evangelical Revival. As a result, the piety, liturgy, and polity of the indigenous churches they established came to reflect these diverse orientations.

== 19th century ==
The Church of Ireland, an Anglican establishment, was disestablished in Ireland in 1869. The Church in Wales would later be disestablished in 1919, but in England the Church never lost its established role. However Methodists, Catholics and other denominations were relieved of many of their disabilities through the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, Catholic emancipation, and parliamentary reform. The Church responded by greatly enlarging its role of activities, and turning to voluntary contributions for funding.

=== Revivals ===

The Plymouth Brethren seceded from the established church in the 1820s. The church in this period was affected by the Evangelical revival and the growth of industrial towns in the Industrial Revolution. There was an expansion of the various Nonconformist churches, notably Methodism. From the 1830s the Oxford Movement became influential and occasioned the revival of Anglo-Catholicism. From 1801 the Church of England and the Church of Ireland were unified and this situation lasted until the disestablishment of the Irish church in 1871 (by the Irish Church Act, 1869).

The growth of the twin &quot;revivals&quot; in 19th century Anglicanism—Evangelical and Catholic—was hugely influential. The Evangelical Revival informed important social movements such as the abolition of slavery, child welfare legislation, prohibition of alcohol, the development of public health and public education. It led to the creation of the Church Army, an evangelical and social welfare association and informed piety and liturgy, most notably in the development of Methodism.

The Catholic Revival had a more penetrating impact by transforming the liturgy of the Anglican Church, repositioning the Eucharist as the central act of worship in place of the daily offices, and reintroducing the use of vestments, ceremonial, and acts of piety (such as Eucharistic adoration) that had long been prohibited in the English church and (to a certain extent) in its daughter churches. It influenced Anglican theology, through such Oxford Movement figures as John Henry Newman, Edward Pusey, as well as the Christian socialism of Charles Gore and Frederick Maurice. Much work was done to introduce a more medieval style of church furnishing in many churches. Neo-Gothic in many different forms became the norm rather than the earlier Neo-Classical forms. Both revivals led to considerable missionary efforts in parts of the British Empire.

===Expanded roles at home and worldwide===
During the 19th century, the Church expanded greatly at home and abroad. The funding came largely from voluntary contributions. In England and Wales it doubled the number of active clergyman, and built or enlarged several thousand churches. Around mid-century it was consecrating seven new or rebuilt churches every month. It proudly took primary responsibility for a rapid expansion of elementary education, with parish-based schools, and diocesan-based colleges to train the necessary teachers. In the 1870s, the national government assume part of the funding; in 1880 the Church was educating 73% of all students. In addition there was a vigorous home mission, with many clergy, scripture readers, visitors, deaconesses and Anglican sisters in the rapidly growing cities. Overseas the Church kept up with the expanding Empire. It sponsored extensive missionary work, supporting 90 new bishoprics and thousands of missionaries across the globe.

In addition to local endowments and pew rentals, Church financing came from a few government grants, and especially from voluntary contributions. The result was that some old rural parishes were well funded, and most of the rapidly growing urban parishes were underfunded.

===Prime ministers and the Queen===
Throughout the 19th century patronage continued to play a central role in Church affairs. Tory Prime Ministers appointed most of the bishops before 1830, selecting men who had served the party, or had been college tutors of sponsoring politicians, or were near relations of noblemen. In 1815, 11 bishops came from noble families; 10 had been the tutors of a senior official. Theological achievement or personal piety were not critical factors in their selection. Indeed, the Church was often called the &quot;praying section of the Tory party.&quot; Not since Newcastle, over a century before, did a prime minister pay as much attention to church vacancies as William Ewart Gladstone. He annoyed Queen Victoria by making appointments she did not like. He worked to match the skills of candidates to the needs of specific church offices. He supported his party by favouring Liberals who would support his political positions. His counterpart, Disraeli, favoured Conservative bishops to a small extent, but took care to distribute bishoprics so as to balance various church factions. He occasionally sacrificed party advantage to choose a more qualified candidate. On most issues Disraeli and Queen Victoria were close, but they frequently clashed over church nominations because of her aversion to high churchmen.

=== 1914–1970 ===


The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the First World War. A chaplain provides spiritual and pastoral support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea or in the field. The Army Chaplains Department was granted the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; in recognition of the chaplains&#x27; wartime service. The Chaplain General of the British Army was Bishop John Taylor Smith who held the post from 1901 to 1925.

While the Church of England was historically identified with the upper classes, and with the rural gentry, William Temple, archbishop of Canterbury (1942–1944), was both a prolific theologian and a social activist, preaching Christian socialism and taking an active role in the Labour Party until 1921. He advocated a broad and inclusive membership in the Church of England as a means of continuing and expanding the church&#x27;s position as the established church. He became archbishop of Canterbury in 1942, and the same year he published &quot;Christianity and Social Order.&quot; The best-seller attempted to marry faith and socialism—by &quot;socialism&quot; he meant a deep concern for the poor. The book helped solidify Anglican support for the emerging welfare state. Temple was troubled by the high degree of animosity inside, and between the leading religious groups in Britain. He promoted ecumenicism, working to establish better relationships with the Nonconformists, Jews and Catholics, managing in the process to overcome his anti-Catholic bias.

===Prayer Book Crisis===

Parliament passed the Enabling Act in 1919 to enable the new Church Assembly, with three houses for bishops, clergy, and laity, to propose legislation for the Church, subject to formal approval of Parliament. A crisis suddenly emerged in 1927 over the Church&#x27;s proposal to revise the classic &quot;Book of Common Prayer,&quot; which had been in daily use since 1662. The goal was to better incorporate moderate Anglo-Catholicism into the life of the Church. The bishops sought a more tolerant, comprehensive established Church. After internal debate the Church&#x27;s new Assembly gave its approval. Evangelicals inside the Church, and Nonconformists outside, were outraged because they understood England&#x27;s religious national identity to be emphatically Protestant and anti-Catholic. They denounced the revisions as a concession to ritualism and tolerance of Roman Catholicism. They mobilized support in parliament, which twice rejected the revisions after intensely heated debates. The Anglican hierarchy compromised in 1929, while strictly prohibiting extreme and Anglo-Catholic practices.

===World War II and postwar===
During the Second World War the head of chaplaincy in the British Army was an Anglican chaplain-general, Charles Symons (with the military rank of major-general), who was formally under the control of the permanent under-secretary of state. An assistant chaplain-general was a chaplain 1st class (full colonel), and a senior chaplain was a chaplain 2nd class (lieutenant colonel). At home the Church saw its role as the moral conscience of the state. It gave enthusiastic support for the war against Nazi Germany. George Bell, bishop of Chichester and a few clergymen spoke out that the aerial bombing of German cities was immoral. They were grudgingly tolerated. Bishop Bell was chastised by fellow clergy members and passed over for promotion. The Archbishop of York replied, &quot;it is a lesser evil to bomb the war-loving Germans than to sacrifice the lives of our fellow countrymen..., or to delay the delivery of many now held in slavery&quot;.

A movement towards unification with the Methodist Church in the 1960s failed to pass through all the required stages on the Anglican side, being rejected by the General Synod in 1972. This was initiated by the Methodists and welcomed on the part of the Anglicans but full agreement on all points could not be reached.

====Divorce====
Standards of morality in Britain changed dramatically after the world wars, in the direction of more personal freedom, especially in sexual matters. The Church tried to hold the line, and was especially concerned to stop the rapid trend toward divorce. It reaffirmed in 1935 that, &quot;in no circumstances can Christian men or women re-marry during the lifetime of a wife or a husband.&quot; When king Edward VIII wanted to marry Mrs. Wallis Simpson, a newly divorced woman, in 1936, the archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang led the opposition, insisting that Edward must go. Lang was later lampooned in Punch for a lack of &quot;Christian charity&quot;.

Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin also objected vigorously to the marriage, noting that &quot;although it is true that standards are lower since the war it only leads people to expect a higher standard from their King.&quot; Baldwin refused to consider Churchill&#x27;s concept of a morganatic marriage where Wallis would not become Queen consort and any children they might have would not inherit the throne. After the governments of the Dominions also refused to support the plan, Edward abdicated in order to marry the woman.

When Princess Margaret wanted in 1952 to marry Peter Townsend, a commoner who had been divorced, the Church did not directly intervene but the government warned she had to renounce her claim to the throne and could not be married in church. Randolph Churchill later expressed concern about rumours about a specific conversation between the archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, and the Princess while she was still planning to marry Townsend. In Churchill&#x27;s view, &quot;the rumour that Fisher had intervened to prevent the Princess from marrying Townsend has done incalculable harm to the Church of England&quot;, according to research completed by historian Ann Sumner Holmes. Margaret&#x27;s official statement, however, specified that the decision had been made &quot;entirely alone&quot;, although she was mindful of the Church&#x27;s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage. Holmes summarizes the situation as, &quot;The image that endured was that of a beautiful young princess kept from the man she loved by an inflexible Church. It was an image and a story that evoked much criticism both of Archbishop Fisher and of the Church&#x27; policies regarding remarriage after divorce.&quot;

However, when Margaret actually did divorce (Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon), in 1978, the then archbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggan, did not attack her, and instead offered support.

In 2005, Prince Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles, a divorcée, in a civil ceremony. Afterwards, the then archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, gave the couple a formal service of blessing. In fact, the arrangements for the wedding and service were strongly supported by the Archbishop &quot;consistent with the Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage&quot; because the bride and groom had recited a &quot;strongly-worded&quot; act of penitence, a confessional prayer written by Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury to King Henry VIII. That was interpreted as a confession by the couple of past sins, albeit without specific reference and going &quot;some way towards acknowledging concerns&quot; over their past misdemeanours.

=== 1970–present ===

The Church Assembly was replaced by the General Synod in 1970.

On 12 March 1994 the Church of England ordained its first female priests. On 11 July 2005 a vote was passed by the Church of England&#x27;s General Synod in York to allow women&#x27;s ordination as bishops. Both of these events were subject to opposition from some within the church who found difficulties in accepting them. Adjustments had to be made in the diocesan structure to accommodate those parishes unwilling to accept the ministry of women priests. (See women&#x27;s ordination)

The first black archbishop of the Church of England, John Sentamu, formerly of Uganda, was enthroned on 30 November 2005 as archbishop of York.

In 2006 the Church of England at its General Synod made a public apology for the institutional role it played as a historic owner of slave plantations in Barbados and Barbuda. The Reverend Simon Bessant recounted the history of the church on the island of Barbados, West Indies, where through a charitable bequest received in 1710 by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, thousands of sugar plantation slaves had been appallingly treated and branded using red-hot irons as the property of the &quot;society&quot;.

In 2010, for the first time in the history of the Church of England, more women than men were ordained as priests (290 women and 273 men).

<text>The Altmühl (, ) is a river in Bavaria, Germany. It is a left tributary of the river Danube and is approximately long.

==Course==
The source of the Altmühl is close to the town of Ansbach. From here the river runs southeastwards as a narrow brook to enter the (a lake) north of Gunzenhausen. After leaving Gunzenhausen, the river moves in a broad curve through the Franconian Jura. It enters the &quot;&quot; (Altmühl Valley Nature Park), which is known for its natural environment: The meanders of the Altmühl river have cut deep gorges into the mountains of the Franconian Jura.

The Altmühl passes the towns of Treuchtlingen, Eichstätt and Beilngries.

Downstream of Dietfurt, the riverbed was straightened and integrated into a canal connecting the river Main and the river Danube (the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal). In spite of protests by conservationists, the canal was opened in 1992 and has changed much of the eastern Altmühl valley.

The Altmühl finally flows into the Danube in Kelheim.

== River ==

The Altmühl rises on the southern slope of the Franconian Ridge northeast of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, near the Hohe Leite and about 500m southeast of the Burgbernheim wilderness Wildbad. As its source, the Royal Bavarian Hydrotechnical Bureau at Munich in 1904 fixed the drainage ditch of Hornauer Weiher. This is fed by some streams; in the meantime the source of one of them is regarded as Altmühl origin. The Altmühl therefore rises just south of the major European watershed and then flows mainly in southeastern direction. It is the slowest river in Bavaria, flows very slowly, is even one of the slowest German rivers and is also the longest river that rises and flows in the same German state.

The Altmühl can be divided into three parts.

In the upper third, it is a meadow river slowly flowing in a valley. The landscape is flat, slightly hilly and the ground consists mainly of rocks of the Keuper period, here mainly limestone and clay. The mudstone seals the subsoil, therefore, the Altmühl in its upper reaches is a not-too- stream.

In its middle course flows the Altmühl in the north and east on Altmühlsee at Gunzenhausen over. The riverbed was rebuilt here during the construction of the Altmühlsee in the 1980s. On the southern shore of the Altmühlsee, the course of the river crosses the Altmühlüberleiter underground .

Only at times of high water discharge does water flow from the Altmühl over the Altmühlzuleiter into the Altmühlsee, which was created as a reservoir to divert water from the Altmühl to the drier river system of the Regnitz. This lake is designated as a bird and nature reserve. The water taken from the lake flows through a tunnel to the Brombach reservoirs, drained by the Brombach (Regnitz basin), north of the continental divide. The water of the Regnitz flows finally over the Main into the Rhine, so that with the transfer an artificial river bifurcation was created.

From Treuchtlingen the Altmühl flows in its lower course through the Franconian Jura plateau, in whose karst limestone it has dug a narrow valley. On the steep valley slopes here sometimes bizarre rock formations, for instance the cauldron shaped washouts near the village Eßlingen, about 20m above the river level.

From Dollnstein the Jura Breakthrough Valley suddenly becomes much wider. From here the Altmühl flows through an earlier valley of the larger Danube. At Rennertshofen this &quot;Urdonautal&quot; branches off from the present Danube valley; in the section where not the Altmühl flows in it, but only small brooks, it is called Wellheim dry valley.

From the year 1910 the course of the river downstream from Unterwurmbach was straightened and regulated with numerous weirs, hence many oxbow lakes were cut off. Since then, some of the regulatory measures have been reversed, for instance near Treuchtlingen-Graben and shortly before Eichstätt at Wasserzell.

Its lowermost course from Dietfurt was expanded in the middle of the 19th century with 10 locks to become a part of the Ludwig-Danube-Main Canal. The same route was used from 1975 to 1991 for the construction of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal, a major shipping route with locks in Riedenburg and Kelheim. For the first time in a waterway construction project in Europe, landscaping plans for ecological measures were set up in order to replace nature and landscape interventions; 15% of the canal construction costs were spent on this. The Altmühl flows into the Danube below Kelheim at Danube kilometers 2411.54. The about 34 kilometers long Altmühl section is included in the federal waterway Main-Danube Canal; In addition, the 580 meters of Altmühl above the weir Dietfurt to the MDK are a federal waterway.

Along the Altmühl runs the well-marked and quite well furnished Altmühltalradweg. Canoeing can be done safely on the river itself.

<text>The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) is a daily tabloid newspaper published in Sydney, Australia, and owned by Nine Entertainment. Founded in 1831 as the &quot;Sydney Herald&quot;, the &quot;Herald&quot; is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Australia and claims to be the most widely read masthead in the country. It is considered a newspaper of record for Australia. 

The newspaper is published in compact print form from Monday to Saturday as &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and on Sunday as its sister newspaper, &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; and digitally as an online site and app, seven days a week. The print edition of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; is available for purchase from many retail outlets throughout the Sydney metropolitan area, most parts of regional New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and South East Queensland.

==Overview==
&quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; publishes a variety of supplements, including the magazines &quot;Good Weekend&quot; (included in the Saturday edition of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;); and &quot;Sunday Life&quot;. There are a variety of lift-outs, some of them co-branded with online classified-advertising sites:
* &quot;The Guide&quot; (television) on Mondays
* &quot;Good Food&quot; (food) and &quot;Domain&quot; (real estate) on Tuesdays
* &quot;Money&quot; (personal finance) on Wednesdays
* &quot;Drive&quot; (motoring), &quot;Shortlist&quot; (entertainment) on Fridays

The executive editor is James Chessell and the editor is Bevan Shields. Tory Maguire is national editor, Monique Farmer is life editor, and the publisher is chief digital and publishing officer Chris Janz.

Former editors include Darren Goodsir, Judith Whelan, Sean Aylmer, Peter Fray, Meryl Constance, Amanda Wilson (the first female editor, appointed in 2011), William Curnow, Andrew Garran, Frederick William Ward (editor from 1884 to 1890), Charles Brunsdon Fletcher, Colin Bingham, Max Prisk, John Alexander, Paul McGeough, Alan Revell, Alan Oakley, and Lisa Davies.

==History==
&quot;The Sydney Herald&quot; was founded in 1831 by three employees of the now-defunct &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot;: Ward Stephens, Frederick Stokes, and William McGarvie. A Centenary Supplement (since digitised) was published in 1931. The original four-page weekly had a print run of 750. The newspaper began to publish daily in 1840, and the operation was purchased in 1841 by an Englishman named John Fairfax who renamed it &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; the following year. Fairfax, whose family were to control the newspaper for almost 150 years, based his editorial policies &quot;upon principles of candour, honesty and honour. We have no wish to mislead; no interest to gratify by unsparing abuse or indiscriminate approbation.&quot;

Donald Murray, who invented a predecessor of the teleprinter, worked at the &quot;Herald&quot; during the 1890s. A weekly &quot;Page for Women&quot; was added in 1905, edited by Theodosia Ada Wallace.

The &quot;SMH&quot; was late to the trend of printing news rather than just advertising on the front page, doing so from 15 April 1944. Of the country&#x27;s metropolitan dailies, only &quot;The West Australian&quot; was later in making the switch. The newspaper launched a Sunday edition, &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot;, in 1949. Four years later, this was merged with the newly acquired &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper to create &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot;, which continues to this day.

By the mid-1960s, a new competitor had appeared in Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s national daily &quot;The Australian&quot;, which was first published on 15 July 1964.

John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited commemorated the Herald&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 1981 by presenting the City of Sydney with Stephen Walker&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Tank Stream Fountain&quot;.

In 1995, the company launched the newspaper&#x27;s web edition &quot;smh.com.au&quot;. The site has since grown to include interactive and multimedia features beyond the content in the print edition. Around the same time, the organisation moved from Jones Street to new offices at Darling Park and built a new printing press at Chullora, in the city&#x27;s west. The &quot;SMH&quot; later moved with other Sydney Fairfax divisions to a building at Darling Island.

In May 2007, Fairfax Media announced it would be moving from a broadsheet format to the smaller compact or tabloid-size, in the footsteps of &quot;The Times&quot;, for both &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot;. After abandoning these plans later in the year, Fairfax Media again announced in June 2012 its plan to shift both broadsheet newspapers to tabloid size, with effect from March 2013. Fairfax also announced it would cut staff across the entire group by 1,900 over three years and erect paywalls around the papers&#x27; websites. The subscription type was to be a freemium model, limiting readers to a number of free stories per month, with a payment required for further access. The announcement was part of an overall &quot;digital first&quot; strategy of increasingly digital or online content over printed delivery, to &quot;increase sharing of editorial content,&quot; and to assist the management&#x27;s wish for &quot;full integration of its online, print and mobile platforms.&quot;

It was announced in July 2013 that the &quot;SMH&quot; news director, Darren Goodsir, would become editor-in-chief, replacing Sean Aylmer.

On 22 February 2014, the Saturday edition was produced in broadsheet format for the final time, with this too converted to compact format on 1 March 2014, ahead of the decommissioning of the printing plant at Chullora in June 2014.

In June 2022, the paper received global coverage and backlash to an attempted outing of Australian actress Rebel Wilson by columnist Andrew Hornery, and the subsequent defence of his since-deleted column by editor Bevan Shields; Wilson pre-empted the Hornery disclosure with an Instagram post confirming her relationship.

===&quot;Daily Life&quot; Woman of the Year===
In 2012, Woman of the Year (WOTY) awards were created by the editor of the &quot;Daily Life&quot; section, Sarah Oakes, inspired by the sexism faced by former prime minister Julia Gillard. Winners were selected as the result of voting by the public as well as a panel of judges appointed by Fairfax. Winners have included:
*2012: Julia Gillard
*2013: &quot;ADFA Kate&quot; (an RAAF cadet, victim of the &quot;Skype sex scandal&quot; at the Australian Defence Force Academy)
*2014: Rosie Batty
*2015: Gillian Triggs
*2016: Mariam Veiszadeh

==Editorial stance==
The contemporary editorial stance of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; is generally centrist. It has been described as the most centrist of Australia&#x27;s three major news publications (the others being &quot;The Australian&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot;). In 2004, the newspaper&#x27;s editorial page stated: &quot;market libertarianism and social liberalism&quot; were the two &quot;broad themes&quot; that guided the &quot;Herald&quot;″s editorial stance. During the 1999 referendum on whether Australia should become a republic, the &quot;Herald&quot; (like the other two major papers) strongly supported a Yes vote. It also endorsed the Yes vote for the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum.

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; did not endorse the Labor Party for federal office in the first six decades of Federation, always endorsing a conservative government. The newspaper has since endorsed Labor in seven federal elections: 1961 (Calwell), 1984 and 1987 (Hawke), 2007 (Rudd), 2010 (Gillard), 2019 (Shorten), and 2022 (Albanese).

During the 2004 Australian federal election, the &quot;Herald&quot; did not endorse a party, but subsequently resumed its practice of making endorsements. After endorsing the Coalition at the 2013 and 2016 federal elections, the newspaper endorsed Bill Shorten&#x27;s Labor Party in 2019, after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted as prime minister.

At the state level, the &quot;Herald&quot; has consistently backed the Coalition; the only time since 1973 that it has endorsed a Labor government for New South Wales was Bob Carr&#x27;s government in the 2003 election, though it declined to endorse either party three times during this period. 
The &quot;Herald&quot; endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The &quot;Herald&quot; endorsed the Liberal-National Coalition in the run-up for the 2023 New South Wales state election.

In May 2023, the &quot;Herald&quot; opposed the extradition of former WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange to the United States, with the newspaper conducting a poll that found 79% oppose Assange&#x27;s extradition to the United States.

=== Myall Creek coverage and apology ===
As &quot;The Sydney Herald&quot;, the newspaper&#x27;s editorial stance at times reflected racist attitudes within the colony, with the paper urging squatters across Australia to emulate the mass killing of Native Americans. The front page of the paper on December 26, 1836 read: &quot;If nothing but extermination will do, they &quot;will&quot; exterminate the savages as they would wild beasts.&quot; In the wake of the Myall Creek massacre in which at least twenty-eight unarmed Wirraayaraay men, women and children were murdered by a group of white stockmen, the paper published a long letter from a squatter in defence the killings. The squatter described the Indigenous inhabitants of Australia as &quot;the most degenerate, despicable, and brutal race of beings in existence&quot;, writing: &quot;they will, and must become extinct – civilization destroys them – where labor and industry flourish, &quot;they&quot; die!&quot; The &quot;Herald&quot;&#x27;s editorialisation on the trials contrasted with other newspapers which were more respectful on the matter and on the notion of Aboriginal Australians being protected under the law as British subjects, the same as settlers. In 2023, the paper apologised for its coverage of the massacre and the subsequent trials of the perpetrators.

After 40 years as art critic, John McDonald was sacked in September 2024.

==Ownership==
Fairfax went public in 1957 and grew to acquire interests in magazines, radio, and television. The group collapsed spectacularly on 11 December 1990 when Warwick Fairfax, who was the great-great-grandson of John Fairfax, attempted to privatise the group by borrowing $1.8 billion. The group was bought by Conrad Black before being re-listed in 1992. In 2006, Fairfax announced a merger with Rural Press, which brought in a Fairfax family member, John B. Fairfax, as a significant player in the company. From 10 December 2018, Fairfax Media merged into Nine Entertainment, making the paper a sister to the Nine Network&#x27;s TCN station. This reunited the paper with a television station; Fairfax had been the founding owner of ATN, which became the flagship of what became the Seven Network.

==Content==
===Column 8===
Column 8 is a short column to which &quot;Herald&quot; readers send their observations of interesting happenings. It was first published on 11 January 1947. The name comes from the fact that it originally occupied the final (8th) column of the broadsheet newspaper&#x27;s front page. In a front-page redesign in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, Column 8 moved to the back page of the first section from 31 July 2000. As at February 2024, the column is the final column on the Opinion (editorial and letters) pages.

The content tends to the quirky, typically involving strange urban occurrences, instances of confusing signs (often in Engrish), word play, and discussion of more or less esoteric topics.

The column is also sometimes affectionately known as Granny&#x27;s Column, after a fictional grandmother who supposedly edited it. The column&#x27;s original logo was a caricature of Sydney Deamer, originator of the column and its author for 14 years.

It was edited for 15 years by George Richards, who retired on 31 January 2004. Other editors besides Deamer and Richards have been Duncan Thompson, Bill Fitter, Col Allison, Jim Cunningham, Pat Sheil, and briefly, Peter Bowers and Lenore Nicklin. The column is, as of March 2017, edited by &quot;Herald&quot; journalist Tim Barlass, who frequently appends reader contributions with puns; and who made the decision to reduce the column&#x27;s publication from its traditional six days a week, down to just weekdays.

===Opinion===
The &quot;Opinion&quot; section is a regular of the daily newspaper, containing opinion on a wide range of issues. Mostly concerned with relevant political, legal and cultural issues, the section presents work by regular columnists, including &quot;Herald&quot; political editor Peter Hartcher, Ross Gittins, and occasional reader-submitted content. Iconoclastic Sydney barrister Charles C. Waterstreet, upon whose life the television workplace comedy &quot;Rake&quot; is loosely based, had a regular humour column in this section.

=== &quot;Good Weekend&quot; ===
&quot;Good Weekend&quot; was launched in May 1978, as a Saturday magazine appearing in both &quot;SMH&quot; and &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;. The editor was Valerie Lawson, and Cyprian Fernandes was founding chief sub-editor.

It is now distributed with both &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; in Saturday editions. It contains, on average, four feature articles written by its stable of writers and others syndicated from overseas as well as sections on food, wine, and fashion. Writers include Stephanie Wood, Jane Cadzow, Melissa Fyfe, Tim Elliott, Konrad Marshall, and Amanda Hooton.

Other sections include &quot;Modern Guru&quot;, which features humorous columnists including Danny Katz responding to the everyday dilemmas of readers; a &quot;Samurai Sudoku&quot;; and &quot;The Two of Us&quot;, containing interviews with a pair of close friends, relatives or colleagues.

&quot;Good Weekend&quot; is edited by Katrina Strickland. Previous editors include Ben Naparstek, Judith Whelan (2004–2011) and Fenella Souter.

==Digitisation==
The paper has been partially digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program project of the National Library of Australia.

==Awards==
In March 2024, David Swan, technology editor of &quot;SMH&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot;, won the 2023 Gold Lizzie for Best Journalist of the Year at the IT Journalism Awards. He also won Best Technology Journalist and Best Telecommunications Journalist, and was highly commended in the Best Technology Issues category. With &quot;The Age&quot;, SMH also won Best Consumer Technology Coverage and were highly commended in the Best News Coverage category.

<text>The Franconian Jura ( , , or ) is an upland in Franconia, Bavaria, Germany. Located between two rivers, the Danube in the south and the Main in the north, its peaks reach elevations of up to and it has an area of some 7053.8 km2. It is part of the Table Jura ().

Large portions of the Franconian Jura are part of the Altmühl Valley Nature Park. The scenic meanders and gorges formed by the river Altmühl draw tourists to visit the region.

Geologically, the Franconian Jura is the eastern continuation of the Swabian Jura. The mountain chains are separated from each other by the impact crater of the Nördlinger Ries.

The northern part of the Franconian Jura is known as Franconian Switzerland ().

<doc id="259086" wikidata="Q377935" url="?curid=259086" title="Yang Shangkun">
<text>Yang Shangkun (3 August 1907 – 14 September 1998) was a Chinese Communist military and political leader, president of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 1988 to 1993, and one of the Eight Elders that dominated the party after the death of Mao Zedong.

Born to a prosperous land-owning family, Yang studied politics at Shanghai University and Marxist philosophy and revolutionary tactics at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. He went on to hold high office under both Mao Zedong and later Deng Xiaoping; from 1945 to 1965 he was Director of the General Office and from 1945 to 1956 Secretary–General of the Central Military Commission (CMC). In these positions, Yang oversaw much of the day-to-day running of government and Party affairs, both political and military, amassing a great deal of bureaucratic power by controlling things like the flow of documents, the keeping of records, and the approval and allocation of funds. Purged, arrested and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he spent 12 years in prison but staged a comeback in 1978, becoming a key ally of Deng, serving as Mayor of Guangzhou (1979–81), and returning to the CMC as Secretary–General and also Vice Chairman (1981–89), before assuming the presidency.

One of the earliest supporters of Chinese economic reform, Yang justified it with references to Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy. However, he strongly opposed any form of political reform, and, despite his own suffering during the Cultural Revolution, actively defended the image and record of Mao. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Yang and his half-brother, General Yang Baibing, were among the most powerful figures in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). Despite his initial hesitation, he went on to play a leading role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was actually the one who planned and supervised the operations to clear the square and surrounding streets. Yang&#x27;s downfall came in 1993, when he failed in his attempts to undermine the new leadership of Jiang Zemin and to retain control of the PLA, and was forced to retire by a coalition of Party elders, including Deng himself.

==Early political and military activities==
Yang was born to a land-owning family in Shuangjiang, Tongnan County, near the city of Chongqing in Sichuan, and studied at Chengdu Higher Normal School and its affiliated secondary school in 1920–25, and then returned to Chongqing. His older brother, Yang Yingong was one of the founding Executive Committee members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Sichuan, and influenced Yang Shangkun&#x27;s ideological orientation. After joining the Communist Youth League in 1925, and the CCP in 1926, he enrolled in Shanghai University, where he studied politics. Later in 1927 Yang traveled to the Soviet Union and enrolled at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where he studied Marxist theory and techniques of political organization and mobilization.

Yang was a member of a group of Chinese students who studied in Moscow and returned to China to take a leading role in the CCP, later known as the 28 Bolsheviks. The Comintern sent Yang back to China to assist and support other pro-Comintern CCP leaders, including Bo Gu, Wang Ming, and Zhang Guotao, but Yang and some of the other 28 Bolsheviks, including Ye Jianying, Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Wentian supported Mao Zedong instead. On his return from Moscow in 1931, Yang Shangkun started his military career in the Chinese Red Army, serving as Director of the Political Department in the 1st Red Army and moving around different battle areas under the command of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai. In January 1934, he was appointed Political Commissar of the 3rd Red Army, commanded by Peng Dehuai.

==Second Sino–Japanese War and Chinese Civil War==
During the Second Sino–Japanese War Yang Shangkun was Deputy Secretary of the CCP North China Bureau and worked with Liu Shaoqi behind the Japanese lines. In January 1939, Yang became Secretary of the North China Bureau and worked with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai to cooperate with the military operations of the Eighth Route Army, including the Hundred Regiments Campaign. In 1941, Yang returned to Yan&#x27;an and worked as personal aide to Mao. In 1945, he became the Director of the General Office of the Party, as well as Secretary–General of the Central Military Commission, that was chaired by Mao himself. In these capacities, he was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the Party&#x27;s military and political work, and carried out this duty with much success.

In the subsequent Chinese Civil War 1949, Yang was Commander of the &quot;Central Security Force&quot; protecting the Party Center, and, in his roles as Director of the General Office and Secretary–General of the CMC, played a significant role in the ultimate Communist victory and the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949.

==People&#x27;s Republic==
After the founding of the PRC in October 1949 and until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Yang Shangkun was one of very few CCP leaders who worked closely with Mao Zedong at Zhongnanhai on a daily basis. As the Director of the General Office and Secretary–General of the CMC, he oversaw much of the actual day-to-day work of most party activities and military affairs. On the eve of the Cultural Revolution Yang was identified as a supporter of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and was purged as a counter-revolutionary. After being ejected from the Communist Party and removed from all positions, Yang was persecuted by Red Guards, who accused Yang of planting a covert listening device to spy on Mao, the same accusation shared by Deng Xiaoping.

Yang remained in prison until Mao died and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, in 1978. After Deng gained control of the military he recalled Yang, raised him to the position of general, and gave Yang the responsibility of reforming China&#x27;s army, which Deng considered as larger than necessary and engaged in too many non-military activities. Deng raised Yang to the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in order to give Yang the authority to complete these reforms (Deng was chairman). In 1982 Yang was also appointed as a full member of the Politburo.

Along with Xi Zhonguxn, Yang persuaded Deng that Guangdong should be a national demonstration zone for Reform and Opening Up.

Yang had a close friendship with Deng and shared many of Deng&#x27;s long-term economic goals, but was far less enthusiastic about the agenda of political liberalization promoted by other senior leaders favored by Deng, including Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili. Yang justified his support of economic reforms by referencing Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy, and he emphasized that the Communist Party should still enjoy overall control of the economy, even in private businesses, through the system of Party committees in all enterprises. He also always defended Mao Zedong as a great and historic leader, despite his own suffering at the hands of radical Maoists.

In the early 1980s, Yang explicitly backed the efforts of a foreign China historian, Harrison Salisbury, to compile an account of the Long March by conducting extensive interviews with surviving Long March participants. The resulting book, &quot;Long March: The Untold Story&quot;, has been praised by China scholars as an excellent synthesis of first-hand oral sources. Within China, many Chinese veterans asked why it took a foreigner to produce such a book.

==Presidency==

In 1988, Yang was appointed President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China replacing Li Xiannian, making him the only President who was not a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. Under the conventions of the 1982 Constitution, the president&#x27;s role was largely symbolic, with formal executive power wielded by the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Premier of the State Council. In practice, party and state leaders still deferred to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who, however, was not all-powerful, as he still had to compromise on some policies with other party elders such as Chen Yun and Li Xiannian.

Yang&#x27;s role during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 caused a fundamental shift in China&#x27;s political structure. Yang was at first sympathetic to the students and sided with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang in supporting them. As the Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission, he even praised Zhao&#x27;s position by claiming that Zhao &quot;Ziyang’s notion of pacifying the student movement through democracy and law is good and seems quite workable right now.&quot; Zhao&#x27;s position was contested by Premier Li Peng and Party elder Li Xiannian, who wanted to use force to suppress the student demonstrations and engaged in an internal power struggle with Zhao to convince other senior leaders of their position.

After the hardliners gained the upper hand, Yang changed his position and supported the use of force to suppress student protestors. In May 1989 Yang appeared on Chinese television, where he denounced the student demonstrations as &quot;anarchy&quot; and defended the imposition of martial law on several areas of Beijing affected by the protests. Yang then mobilized and planned the suppression of the demonstrators, an operation in which several hundred protesters were killed on 4 June and subsequent days. Yang&#x27;s nephew, Yang Jianhua, commanded the highly disciplined 27th Group Army, which was brought into Beijing from Hebei to suppress the demonstrators.
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Yang Shangkun was hugely influential within the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, purged China&#x27;s military of any officers who had not sufficiently supported the government&#x27;s violent crackdown on students. Yang then began an organized attempt to fill as many senior military positions as possible with his supporters, generating an attitude of resentment among other military elders, who accused Yang of attempting to dominate the army and possibly challenge Deng&#x27;s authority by developing a &quot;Yang family clique&quot;. When Yang resisted the rise of Jiang Zemin (who had been the Party secretary of Shanghai), whom Deng began to groom to succeed him as paramount leader, party elders, including Deng himself forced Yang to retire in 1993, along with some of his family.

==Later life==
According to Voice of America, before Yang Shangkun died in 1998, he allegedly told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that the crackdown on 4 June had been the most serious mistake committed by Li Peng and the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang believed he could not correct, but which he believed would eventually be corrected.

Yang died on 14 September 1998, aged 91. His official obituary described him as &quot;a great proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state, and the people&#x27;s army.&quot; On 2001, the ashes of Yang and his wife were interred at a cemetery named after him in Tongnan District, Chongqing.

==Personal life==
In 1929, he married Li Bozhao, a woman who participated in the Long March alongside Yang. They had three sons.

<doc id="259087" wikidata="Q745977" url="?curid=259087" title="John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford">
<text>John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford ( 1485 – 14 March 1555) was an English royal minister in the Tudor era. He served variously as Lord High Admiral and Lord Privy Seal. Among the lands and property he was given by Henry VIII after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, were the Abbey and town of Tavistock, and the area that is now Covent Garden. Russell is the ancestor of all subsequent Earls and Dukes of Bedford and Earls Russell, including John Russell, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and philosopher Bertrand Russell.

==Origins==
&lt;section begin=Russell origins/&gt; 
John Russell was born c. 1485 probably at Berwick-by-Swyre, Dorset, the son of Sir James Russell (d. Nov. 1505) and his first wife Alice Wyse, daughter of Thomas Wyse of Sidenham, near Tavistock, Devon. James&#x27;s father was possibly Sir William Russell, but more likely his brother John Russell (d. pre-November, 1505) by his wife Alice Froxmere, daughter of John Froxmere of Droitwich, Worcestershire, because his coat of arms quarters Froxmere. The elder John Russell was the son of Sir Henry Russell (d. 1463/4), and Elizabeth Herring, daughter of John Herring of Chaldon Herring. Henry, a great-grandfather of the 1st earl, was a substantial wine merchant and shipper, who represented Weymouth in the House of Commons four times.

The Russell pedigree can only be traced back with certainty to Henry Russell&#x27;s father, Sir Stephen Russell, the evidence being contained in a deed of April 1440 in which Henry Russell made over to his daughter Christina and her husband Walter Cheverell of Chauntemarle, a tenement in Dorchester to be held of himself and his heirs upon the rent of a red rose. In the deed, Henry referred to himself as &quot;son and heir of Sir Stephen Russell and of Alice, his wife&quot;. This Alice appears to have been the heir general of the De la Tour family, which had long owned Berwick-by-Swyre, and by whom therefore the manor was brought into the Russell family.

Both Sir Henry and Sir Stephen were referred to as &quot;Gascoigne&quot; as well as &quot;Russell&quot;, possibly due to their wine trade with France (see Gascoigne), as in a 1442 pardon under the Privy Seal referring to &quot;Henry Russell of Weymouth, merchant,&quot; alias &quot;Henry Gascoign, gentleman&quot;. It was long believed in the noble Russell family, certainly by the 2nd Earl of Bedford, that the family was descended from the ancient family of Russell of Kingston Russell in Dorset, three miles north-east of Berwick, which descent was declared unproven by Gladys Scott Thomson in her &quot;Two Centuries of Family History&quot;, London, 1930, an exhaustive and scholarly work on the early pedigree of the Earls of Bedford. (&quot;For a disambiguation of the Bedford Russells and the Russells of Kingston Russell, see&quot; Kingston Russell House.)
&lt;section end=Russell origins/&gt;

==Career==
In 1506 John Russell was of service to Archduke Philip of Austria and Juana his wife (king and queen of Castile) when they were shipwrecked off Weymouth, and escorted the royal couple to the English court in London. He was one of the most accomplished gentlemen of his time and so impressed them by his gracious manners that they praised him highly to King Henry VII. He became a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry VII in 1507 and to his son and successor Henry VIII in 1509, who employed him in various military and diplomatic missions during the War of the League of Cambrai. He was at the taking of Thérouanne and Tournai. He was knighted on 2 July 1522 after losing an eye at the taking of Morlaix in Brittany, and he witnessed the Battle of Pavia.

Following his marriage in the Spring of 1526, he made alterations to his ancestral seat Chenies Manor House to reflect his new good fortunes. He now stood in favour with the king and Cardinal Wolsey, though he would not suffer disgrace at the fall of the latter.

He was made High Sheriff of Dorset and Somerset in 1528 and served as Member of Parliament for Buckinghamshire 1529–1536, retaining the royal favour despite the antipathy of Anne Boleyn. Late in 1536, he was made a Privy Counsellor, and helped to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace.

The fall and execution of Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter, left a power vacuum in the south-western counties of England, which Russell was called upon to fill. On 9 March 1538/1539 he was created Baron Russell, and appointed Lord President of the Council of the West. In the next month, he was made a Knight of the Garter. In July 1539 he was made High Steward of Cornwall, and Lord Warden of the Stannaries.

The Council of the West proved unsuccessful as an instrument of government, and did not survive the fall of Cromwell. Russell, however, remained a great magnate in the western counties, and obtained the office of Lord High Admiral in 1540. (The previous holder, the Earl of Southampton, replaced Cromwell as Lord Privy Seal.) After Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves at Rochester, the next day he asked Russell if he &quot;thought her fair&quot;. Russell replied with his natural diplomacy and prudence that he took her &quot;not to be &quot;fair&quot;, but of a &quot;brown&quot; complexion&quot;. In 1542, Russell himself resigned from the Admiralty and succeeded to the Privy Seal on the death of Southampton. He was High Steward of the University of Oxford from 1543 till his death.

During the Italian War of 1542, he unsuccessfully besieged Montreuil in 1544, and was Captain General of the Vanguard of the army for the attack on Boulogne in 1545. He was a close companion of King Henry VIII during the last years of his reign. On Henry&#x27;s death in 1547, he was one of the executors of the king&#x27;s will, and one of sixteen counsellors during the minority of his son King Edward VI.

On 21 June 1553 he was one of the twenty-six peers who signed the settlement of the crown on Lady Jane Grey. He was sent to attend King Philip II into England on his arrival from Spain to wed the Queen Mary.

==Earldom==
He was Lord High Steward at the Coronation of King Edward VI (1547–1553) on 20 February 1547. He was created by that young king (in practice by the Regent) Earl of Bedford on 19 January 1550 for his assistance in carrying out the order of the Council against &quot;images&quot; and for promoting the new religion. In 1552, he was made Lord Lieutenant of Devon.

==Marriage and progeny==
In the spring of 1526 he married Anne Sapcote, daughter of Sir Guy Sapcote of Huntingdonshire by his wife Margaret Wolston, and widow, successively, of John Broughton (d. 24 January 1518) of Toddington, Bedfordshire, by whom she had a son and three daughters, and, secondly, of Sir Richard Jerningham (d.1525), by whom she had no issue. By Anne Sapcote he had one child:
*Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford (1527–1585), son and heir

===Step-children===
The issue of Anne Sapcote by her first husband John Broughton (d. 1518) were as follows:
*John Broughton (d. 1528).
*Katherine Broughton (d. 23 April 1533), who was the ward firstly of Cardinal Wolsey, and secondly Agnes Howard, Duchess of Norfolk, who arranged the marriage of Katherine, as his first wife, to her eldest son, William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham.
*Anne Broughton (d. 16 May 1562), who married, as his second wife, by dispensation dated 24 May 1539, Sir Thomas Cheyney, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. There is a monument to her at Toddington.
*Daughter whose name is unknown, and who died between July 1517 and 1529.

==Death and burial==

Russell died on 14 March 1554/5 and was buried at his ancestral manor of Chenies, Buckinghamshire, in the private Bedford Chapel of the parish church next to Chenies Manor House, his former chief residence. The Dukes of Bedford continue to be buried in this chapel.

His widow, Anne, died on 14 March 1559 and was buried at Chenies on 21 March 1559.

==Succession==
Russell is the ancestor of all subsequent Earls and Dukes of Bedford and Earls Russell, including John Russell, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the philosopher Bertrand Russell.

==Properties acquired==
On the Dissolution of the Monasteries King Henry VIII granted Russell lands and properties including Tavistock Abbey and Plympton Abbey in Devon, the wealthiest two abbeys in Devon, and the Cistercian Dunkeswell Abbey also in Devon. He was granted the Blackfriars in Exeter, on the site of which he built his opulent townhouse known as Bedford House, from where he conducted his duties as Lord Lieutenant of Devon. These grants made him the largest landowner in Devon. In Bedfordshire, he acquired the site of Woburn Abbey which he made his chief seat. In London he was granted called &quot;Long Acre&quot;, and the kitchen garden of Westminster Abbey, which is now the site of Covent Garden. The present Duke of Bedford (or his trustees, the &quot;Bedford trustees&quot;) retain still in 2013 several acres of prime London property comprising the Bedford Estate centred on Bedford Square and Tavistock Square.

==Garter stall plate==

John Russell&#x27;s Garter stall plate survives affixed to the back of his stall in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

<text>Brian Fawcett (May 13, 1944 – February 27, 2022) was a Canadian writer and cultural analyst. He was awarded the Pearson Writers&#x27; Trust Non-Fiction Prize in 2003 for his book &quot;Virtual Clearcut, or The Way Things Are in My Hometown&quot;. He was also nominated for the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Award for Literary Excellence in 2012 for &quot;Human Happiness&quot;.

==Early life==
Fawcett was born in Prince George, British Columbia, on May 13, 1944. His father, Hartley, was a soft drink salesman in Alberta who moved to Prince George during the late 1930s to establish his own company; his mother was Rita Surry. Fawcett initially went to Connaught Junior High School in his hometown, before attending Prince George Senior High School. After working in the forest service for three years, he relocated to Vancouver at the age of 22 to study at the newly-formed Simon Fraser University (SFU). There, he was taught by R. Murray Schafer and Robin Blaser, who influenced his writings. Fawcett graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1969 and was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow for the 1969–1970 academic year. Before becoming a full-time writer, he worked as an urban planner and community organizer in Metro Vancouver until 1985. He also taught English to inmates in Matsqui Institution.

==Career==
Fawcett established a small magazine at SFU named NMFG (an acronym for &quot;No Money From Government&quot;). He utilized the pen name Gordon Lockhead to edit the periodical, which was issued from February 1976 until September 1978. He authored seven books of poetry during this time. He later published his first collection of short stories in 1982, titled &quot;My Career with the Leafs and Other Stories&quot;, in which he recounted childhood memories of growing up in Prince George.

Fawcett ultimately published over 20 books of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. One of these works, &quot;&quot; (1986), which gave an account of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian genocide, received recognition across Canada. In another collection of short stories titled &quot;Capital Tales&quot; (1984), he delved into violence and a variety of storytelling techniques. &quot;The Secret Journal of Alexander Mackenzie&quot;, released one year later, analyzed the misuse of the remote areas of British Columbia in a fictional setting, as well as recognizing the &quot;global village&quot; invasion from a psychological and economic perspective. Fawcett also authored a column in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; focusing on political and cultural affairs. After residing in Vancouver for around a quarter of a century, he relocated to Toronto and co-founded the website www.dooneyscafe.com in 2001, together with Stan Persky. Named after a restaurant on Toronto&#x27;s Bloor Street West, the site is described as &quot;a news service&quot; and to which he was a regular contributor. He also taught cultural literacy in maximum security prisons. His book &quot;Virtual Clearcut: Or, the Way Things Are in My Hometown&quot; won the Pearson Writers&#x27; Trust Non-Fiction Prize in 2003, with Fawcett receiving C$15,000 as a result.

&quot;Human Happiness&quot; was published in 2012 and was nominated for the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Award for Literary Excellence. Fawcett released his final major book the following year, titled &quot;The Last of the Lumbermen&quot;. It detailed a celebrated hockey team in Prince George during the 1950s and 1960s, and became one of his most eminent works. Fawcett was working on two books at the time of his death in 2022, which are scheduled to be published posthumously.

==Personal life==
Fawcett married his first wife, Sharon Thesen, in October 1966. They were high school sweethearts and later studied at SFU together. Together, they had one child, Jesse. They separated in 1972, and eventually divorced. After moving to Toronto, Fawcett married Leanna Crouch, who was a producer of &quot;Imprint&quot;. Together, they had one daughter, Hartlea. He was later in a domestic partnership with Fran Piccaluga until his death. He had another child, Max.

Fawcett died on February 27, 2022, in Toronto, at age 77, after suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for four years.

<text>Arthur Bertram Modell (June 23, 1925 – September 6, 2012) was an American businessman, entrepreneur and National Football League (NFL) team owner. He owned the Cleveland Browns franchise for 35 years and established the Baltimore Ravens franchise, which he owned for eight years.

Assuming control of the Browns franchise in 1961, Modell was a key figure in helping promote the NFL and was initially popular in Cleveland for his active role in the community and his efforts to improve the team. However, he made controversial actions during his ownership, which included the firing of Paul Brown, the franchise&#x27;s first coach and namesake, and the release of Jim Brown from the roster. In 1995, Modell faced widespread scorn in Cleveland when he attempted to relocate the Browns to Baltimore. Under the terms of an NFL-brokered settlement, Modell left the Browns&#x27; name and heritage in Cleveland, which was assumed by a new Browns team in 1999. In return, Modell retained the contracts of all Browns personnel and reconstituted his organization as the Baltimore Ravens, who are officially recognized as a 1996 expansion team.

Praised in Baltimore for returning football to the city after the departure of the Colts, Modell remains a controversial figure in Cleveland due to the relocation and, in particular, for his decision-making around the management of Cleveland Stadium and the construction of a replacement.

==Early life and education==
Modell was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. His father George was a wine sales manager who went bankrupt after the stock market crash of 1929 and later died when Modell was 14. Modell attended New Utrecht High School. Modell saw his first football game when he was nine years old. At the age of 15, Modell left high school to help support his family. His first job was cleaning the hulls of ships in a Brooklyn shipyard.

In 1943, when he was 18, he joined the United States Army Air Forces. After his service during World War II, he enrolled in a New York City television school under the G.I. Bill. In 1947, he founded his own production company with a fellow student and in 1949, they produced one of the first daytime shows in the country, &quot;Market Melodies&quot;, dedicated to cooking and decorating. Modell sold the idea of his show to the Grand Union grocery store chain and Modell installed televisions, at his expense, in the aisles of the chain&#x27;s stores where the show soon became very popular. At the time, very few households had televisions so the store format was wildly successful. In 1954, using the lucrative Grand Union account as leverage, he was hired as a senior account executive at the advertising company L.H. Hartman Co. in New York City, eventually becoming a partner. Formed after the Prohibition era, L.H. Hartman was primarily involved in liquor advertising. In 1958, Modell bought an upstate New York champagne maker, Gold Seal Vineyards Inc. In 1960, L.H. Hartman was dissolved, and Modell again used his Grand Union account to land a job as senior vice president at the advertising firm Kastor, Hilton, Chesley, Clifford &amp; Atherton.

==Owner of the Cleveland Browns (1961–1995)==
During the 1940s and 1950s, Modell worked in advertising, public relations, and television production in New York City. In 1960, Modell had heard from someone close to Fred &quot;Curly&quot; Morrison, a former Browns running back who worked as an advertising executive for CBS television, that the Cleveland Browns were going to be up for sale. The two most prominent parties interested in the Browns (which had the Nationwide Insurance Company as the largest Browns shareholder among various Cleveland businessmen such as Dave R. Jones) was a group led by Bill Evans of Diamond Alkali and the other was a group headlined by a group of Rudy Schaefer of the Schaefer Brewing Company and various investors to go with Modell. It was noted that head coach Paul Brown, present since the team was founded, was the key last word on any potential sale of the team, as league executives trusted him best about maintaining stability, particularly since Brown was negotiating a contract that would pay him $50,000 for eight years with the new group. At any rate, it was announced in January 1961 that the Modell group would purchase the team for roughly $4 million, with Modell having contributed a portion from his own personal funds and also taking out a loan for several thousands of dollars more. Named as the chairman of the team, he was quoted at the time as having called the team has “my only business and I am going to keep my hands on it.”

===Modell &amp; Paul Brown (1961–1963)===
In his first season as owner in 1961, the Browns won the same number of games under him that they had won in 1960: eight, which was only good enough for third place. Right before the start of the 1962 season, Brown traded away All-Pro Bobby Mitchell and first-round draft pick Leroy Jackson for Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis, who had been selected first overall in the NFL draft by the Washington Redskins but refused to play for George Preston Marshall without the knowledge of Modell, as he was told about the trade by Marshall. Modell recalled being told by Marshall that he &quot;better get out of the business if you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on in your own franchise.&quot; Modell proceeded to chide Brown about the deal made behind his back. Davis was shortly thereafter diagnosed with terminal leukemia, and some doctors felt that Davis playing football would not exacerbate his condition. He began a conditioning program in preparation to play in the regular season and desired to be a part of the team. Brown and Modell&#x27;s working relationship was permanently strained after Brown then, against Modell&#x27;s wishes, continuously refused to play Davis. Davis died the following year without ever playing a snap. By that point, the rift between Paul Brown and some of his players, such as Milt Plum and Jim Brown, who openly questioned Brown&#x27;s coaching methods and demeanor, grew too much to bear. Players took concerns to the new owner Modell, who they could better relate to than the older, more disciplinarian head coach. Three weeks after a season that saw the Browns win seven games and finish in third place again, Modell had made up his mind. Modell fired Brown on January 9, 1963, which happened to occur in the middle of a newspaper strike in Cleveland. When asked about it at the time about his reasoning, he stated that there were two important ones among the &quot;maybe 25 reasons why&quot;, which involved his belief that the maximum potential of the team was not being realized and that at least seven players were not willing to come back to the team for 1963 under the same conditions as 1962. He later named Brown&#x27;s assistant, Blanton Collier, as the new head coach on January 16, 1963.

===Browns win NFL Championship Game (1964)===
After three non-playoff seasons, the 1964 Browns&#x27; team would finish 10–3–1 and appear in the 1964 NFL Championship Game against a heavily favored Don Shula coached Baltimore Colts team with Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas as its signal caller. The Browns beat the Colts 27–0 in Cleveland Municipal Stadium. This particular Browns team consisted of many players initially drafted and acquired by Brown. During the next 30 years in Cleveland, not a single Modell team won the league title, as the Browns would advance to the NFL/AFC championship title games six further times in his ownership and lose them all.

===Modell&#x27;s team promotions===
Using his background in advertising to market the team, Modell showed a flair for promotions, with one popular innovation coming in 1962 by scheduling pro football preseason doubleheaders at Cleveland Stadium. Modell also became active in NFL leadership, serving as NFL President from to , and using his television connections to help negotiate the league&#x27;s increasingly lucrative television contracts. Under his tenure, the NFL Players Association was formally recognized by the owners in 1968 as a representative of the players that (after a brief strike) resulted in the first NFL collective bargaining agreement being reached.

It was he who agreed to move his team (alongside the Baltimore Colts and the Pittsburgh Steelers) to the newly formed American Football Conference as part of the AFL–NFL merger in . Modell was willing to provide his team as an opponent for both the first prime time Thanksgiving game in 1966 and the opening &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcast in 1970. He was chairman of the league Television Committee from 1962 to 1993. At the time he joined the committee, the league was negotiating deals for TV at a price of $14 million. By the time of the last deal Modell was involved with in , the league had made a television deal for $3.6 billion. 
===Community involvement in Cleveland area===

Modell took an active role in Cleveland community life and was a leading fundraiser for charities and various Republican Party candidates. He married TV soap opera star Patricia Breslin in 1969, having previously been a well-known bachelor and man about town. For many years he was able to disarm newspaper and TV reporters with his quick wit. For example, with regard to the NFL&#x27;s innovative policy of sharing all network television revenue on an equal basis per team, so that the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants each got an equal slice of the revenue, Modell joked that the NFL is run by &quot;a bunch of fat-cat Republicans who vote socialist on football.&quot;

===Player contract battles===
In the offseason after the 1965 season, Jim Brown was in England for shooting of &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. Modell threatened him with fines when it came to the question of missing portions of training camp. Insulted, Brown retired from football in July 1966.

In 1967, five African American members of the Browns involved in a contract dispute refused to report to training camp. Modell eventually traded or released four of the players, with only standout running back Leroy Kelly staying. Kelly would go on to &quot;play out his option&quot; but the restrictive nature of free agency in the NFL at the time severely limited his options. Subsequent contract battles included various stars and free agents that did not pan out. In 1977, the Browns drafted a punter in the second round with Tom Skladany. He happened to have Howard Slusher as his agent, who was described by Modell as a significant thorn in the side of pro football. When Modell wouldn&#x27;t budge on the pay for Skladany in the contract discussion, Skladany sat out the whole season. Chip Banks, who won the 1982 Defensive Player of the Year honors with the team, went through consecutive contract holdouts (one of which was to try and negotiate a loan forgiven by Modell) and was even considered to be traded for a supplemental draft pick. It eventually resulted in a trade away from Cleveland.

By 1990, fan animosity manifested itself with anti-Modell stadium banners that were quickly removed by Cleveland Stadium management, which only inspired fans to decide to get creative by buying planes to fly signs near the stadium or to use steel girders with anti-Modell statements. In March 1995, the Browns agreed to a five-year, $17-million deal with free-agent wide receiver Andre Rison. The deal came only after Modell (who labeled him as the biggest star signed by the Browns) had to personally guarantee a $5 million loan for the signing bonus. Modell&#x27;s statement about needing to take out the loan made Rison believe Modell made him a &quot;scapegoat&quot; and stated that he received anonymous death threats afterwards. One year later, the team cut Rison to make way for newly drafted players such as Ray Lewis and Jonathan Ogden.

==As Municipal Stadium landlord (1973–1995)==
Modell took control of Cleveland Municipal Stadium in 1973, which had been owned by the City of Cleveland but had become too expensive for the city to operate or maintain. Modell had started the idea of buying land in Strongsville and building a stadium in the Cleveland suburbs. He worked out a 25-year lease deal with the city whereby his newly formed entity, dubbed Stadium Corp., would rent the stadium from the city for $1 per year, assume all operating and repair costs and would sublease the stadium to its two primary tenants, the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, Cleveland&#x27;s franchise in the American League of Major League Baseball.

As head of Stadium Corp., Modell was also the landlord of the Indians organization. This was a sound business decision even though the Indians played poorly and drew small crowds throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s. The Browns who were paying rent to both themselves and Modell, by constructing loges in the ballpark, generated significant cash flow from the loge rentals not shared with the Indians. Modell later claimed the loge rentals were not profitable as he had financed their construction at the prevailing high interest rates, although he did not explain why the rental income that was earned was not used to offset the debt. The Indians organization became dissatisfied with Modell&#x27;s Stadium Corp. as its landlord. Modell did not share the loge revenues earned from baseball games with the Indians. Eventually the Indians persuaded City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County voters to fund a new ballpark (which became known as Jacobs Field, later renamed Progressive Field) through new taxes. In turn, Modell was dissatisfied with the Indians&#x27; new ballpark because Stadium Corp.&#x27;s suite rental revenue decreased once Jacobs Field opened. Many suite customers switched their business from Cleveland Stadium&#x27;s older suites to Jacobs Field&#x27;s newer suites, due to the Indians&#x27; new-found success and popularity in the mid-1990s and because Modell&#x27;s Stadium Corp. refused to decrease the annual rent for the suites even though the events for which the suites could be used decreased substantially (81 home games) with the loss of the Indians as a tenant. 

In 1979, Stadium Corp. and Modell were implicated in a lawsuit brought by Browns minority shareholder Robert Gries of Gries Sports Enterprises. He had owned 43 percent of the team. He successfully alleged that Stadium Corp. manipulated the Browns&#x27; accounting records to help Stadium Corp. and Modell absorb a loss on real property that had been purchased in the Cleveland suburb of Strongsville as a potential site for a new stadium that had him claiming it was worth more than when he had sold the land to Stadium Corp. The lawsuit eventually ended in favor of Gries (he would later sell his family interest upon the move to Baltimore). Modell was offered a place as a tenant in Cleveland&#x27;s new Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex. However, he instead asked for improvements to Municipal Stadium. Because Modell&#x27;s Stadium Corp. still controlled Municipal Stadium, it may have made more business sense for Modell to try to keep the Indians at Municipal, particularly as the baseball team began to show signs of improvement both on the playing field and at the box office. Modell made attempts to make money with the stadium any way he could, which even included a deal to have the Stadium host Northwestern versus Ohio State on October 19, 1991. The game itself, referred to as &quot;The Modell Bowl&quot; was a dud for Northwestern, but they reaped the benefits moreso than Modell, as the game was thousands short of a sellout. Meanwhile, the Indians went on to play in the World Series in 1995 and 1997, and sold out 455 straight games at Jacobs Field from 1995 until 2001. The City of Cleveland agreed to make the improvements to Municipal Stadium which were to be funded through an extension of the sin tax, which was instead used to provide funding for the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex.

==Modell relocates to Baltimore (1996)==

While the City of Cleveland, Ohio, wanted to improve Municipal Stadium, Modell issued a public moratorium on discussions relating to the stadium issue for the future of his franchise. It was during this time that Modell entered into secret discussions with the State of Maryland to move the franchise to Baltimore for the 1996 season. The Browns were not the first team that received queries about relocation to Baltimore, as they had asked the Cincinnati Bengals earlier in the year about their status that had their team owner visit the city.

The announcement of the move occurred several days before the public referendum on the extension of the sin tax that would fund the improvements on Municipal Stadium as Modell had originally requested. Modell wrote a letter to Cleveland&#x27;s mayor Michael R. White and Ohio&#x27;s governor George Voinovich saying that the passing of the referendum may not be enough to keep the Browns. Modell had lost $21 million in the previous two seasons. Modell also wanted that information to be made public. Commentators have speculated that the timing of the announcement was to cause the referendum to go down in defeat and thus allow Modell to make the case that he was not receiving the public support he needed to remain viable in Cleveland. Nonetheless, the referendum was passed by a wide margin. Modell was assisted in the move by Alfred Lerner, who would go on to become the new owner of the reactivated Cleveland Browns franchise in 1998. Modell&#x27;s move returned the NFL to Baltimore for the first time since the Colts left for Indianapolis after the 1983 season. The reaction in Cleveland was hostile. Modell had promised never to move the team. He had publicly criticized the Baltimore Colts&#x27; move to Indianapolis, and had testified in favor of the NFL in court cases where the league unsuccessfully tried to stop Al Davis from moving the Oakland Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles.

===&quot;The City of Cleveland vs. Cleveland Browns&quot;===
The City of Cleveland sued Modell, the Browns, Stadium Corp, the Maryland Stadium Authority, and the authority&#x27;s director, John A. Moag Jr., in &quot;City of Cleveland v. Cleveland Browns, et al.&quot;, Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas Case No. CV-95-297833, for breaching the Browns&#x27; lease, which required the team to play its home games at Cleveland Stadium for several years beyond 1995.

===Browns franchise deactivated, to resume in &#x27;99===
Eventually, the NFL and the parties worked out a deal. The Browns&#x27; franchise would be deactivated for three years. Modell initially tried to take the Browns name with him to Baltimore. However, as part of a negotiated settlement, Modell agreed that he would leave behind the Browns&#x27; name, colors and heritage (including team records) for a replacement franchise, in the form of either a new team or a relocated franchise. In return, Modell was allowed to take the franchise rights, players and organization to Baltimore to form a new team, the Ravens. Cleveland received a loan from the NFL to help with the cost of a new stadium. The Browns returned to the NFL in 1999 with Lerner, a friend of Modell as well as a minority owner of Modell&#x27;s original franchise and MBNA CEO and owner, assuming ownership, after Lerner outbid other interested parties for the right to buy the reactivated Browns&#x27; franchise.

===The Browns&#x27; record under Modell===
During Modell&#x27;s 35 seasons as team owner the Browns qualified for the postseason 17 times, winning 11 division titles and the NFL championship in 1964. The team&#x27;s overall regular season record during Modell&#x27;s tenure was 278–233–7, (winning percentage .542) with a postseason record of 7–14.

===Impact of move===
The move fueled a proliferation of 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL. Using the NFL-City of Cleveland agreement&#x27;s promise to supply a team to Cleveland by 1999, several NFL franchises coerced their respective cities to build new stadiums with public funds. Such franchises include the Broncos, Eagles, Seahawks, Buccaneers, Bengals, Lions, Cardinals and Colts.

The Minnesota Twins signed a deal with Hennepin County, Minnesota, for Target Field in 2006, where they agreed to a provision that was later codified into law which allows the state of Minnesota the right of first refusal to buy the team if it is ever sold, and requires that the name, colors, World Series trophies, etc. remain in Minnesota if the Twins are ever moved out of state, a deal similar to what Modell agreed to with the city of Cleveland during the move.

In December 2005, the San Jose Earthquakes MLS franchise moved to Houston, Texas, to become the Houston Dynamo. At the time, it was announced by the league that while players and staff would move with the team, the team name, colors, logo, and records (including two championship trophies) would stay in San Jose for when a new expansion team arrives. In 2008, the Earthquakes returned under the ownership of Lew Wolff, a real estate developer, landowner and part-owner of the Oakland Athletics MLB franchise.

When the Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 2008, the owners agreed to leave the &quot;SuperSonics&quot; name, logo, and colors in Seattle for a possible future NBA franchise; however the items would remain the property of the Oklahoma City team along with other &quot;assets&quot; including championship banners and trophies. The team was subsequently renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder. Both the Thunder and any future Seattle NBA team will also &quot;share&quot; the SuperSonics&#x27; history.

Modell was a Hall of Fame finalist in 2001 and a semifinalist in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011 and was denied each and every time.

The original Browns were considered one of the NFL&#x27;s flagship franchises, as well as an institution by many Northern Ohioans. He never returned to Cleveland after 1996. When Browns kicking legend Lou &quot;The Toe&quot; Groza died in 2000, Modell did not appear.

===Browns&#x27; final game at Municipal Stadium (1995)===
When the final game was played in Cleveland Municipal Stadium in 1995, there were more people outside it protesting the move than inside enjoying the potential last Browns game. The protesters were acknowledged by the NBC announcing crew. Several players remained on the field after the game and did laps around the stadium to slap hands with fans, while others took out stadium seats and sod. Modell was not present for the game. Months after the game, the deal to bring the Browns back in 1999 was announced.

==As principal owner of Baltimore Ravens (1996–2004)==
===Former Colts players, fans rally around team===
Many Baltimore fans, including several prominent old-time Colts players who lived in the area, considered the Ravens to be the successors of the Baltimore Colts.

Other retired stars, like Art Donovan, had mixed emotions about the Ravens&#x27; arrival: happiness that the great fans of the city now had an NFL team to cheer for again, but also sadness that Cleveland had felt the same loss that Baltimore had in 1984, and a neutral view of the new team itself.

===Head coaching changes===
Upon the team&#x27;s move in 1996, Modell selected former NFL head coach and offensive guru Ted Marchibroda as its new head coach. Marchibroda, who also had been the head of the Colts when they were in Baltimore during the late 1970s, had coached them the previous three seasons in Indianapolis, and they were fresh off of an appearance in a memorable 1995 AFC Championship loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

However, the new Ravens still struggled to be competitive and suffered in mediocrity for the first 3 seasons in Baltimore, missing the playoffs each year. In 1999, they hired former NFL assistant coach Brian Billick as the head coach, replacing Marchibroda. Like Marchibroda, Billick, an Ohio native, had been considered one of the brightest offensive minds among the league&#x27;s offensive coaches, and also had been considered by Modell as a possible Browns head coaching candidate.

===Super Bowl XXXV===
In 2000, the Ravens, under the coaching of Billick, qualified for the postseason for the first time, winning the AFC Wild-Card position with a 12–4 record. (Tennessee won their division that year.) Led by a stingy defense anchored by team captain and NFL All-Pro middle linebacker Ray Lewis and quarterbacked by former Pro-Bowler Trent Dilfer, they would go on to defeat the NFC Champion New York Giants in the Super Bowl, 34–7. Shortly after the Super Bowl XXXV victory, Modell handed the reins of the day-to-day operations of the team over to his son, David. In that same year, Modell testified at the murder trial of Lewis on his behalf, and Lewis later described him as &quot;like a father figure&quot;. The Ravens qualified again for the postseason in 2001 as defending Super Bowl champions, and once more in 2003, winning their first division title. As an owner of the Ravens, the regular season record during Modell&#x27;s tenure as team owner was 72–63.

===Community involvement in Baltimore area===
Modell and his wife, former television actress Patricia Breslin, donated millions of dollars to a variety of charities, most notably the SEED School, a boarding school being developed in Baltimore for disadvantaged youth; Johns Hopkins Hospital; Kennedy Krieger Institute; St. Vincent&#x27;s Center, a home for abused children; and the House of Ruth, a domestic violence center. Modell received the Generous Heart Award from Dr. Ben Carson Scholarship Foundation, given annually for excellence in the community.

===Ravens sold to minority owner Bisciotti===
Despite a no-cost stadium lease, as well as retaining all revenues from parking, concessions, and TV, as well as a reported $25 million subsidy from the state of Maryland, Modell&#x27;s ownership of the Ravens resulted in continual financial hardships for the team. In late 2002, the hardships led the NFL to take the unusual step of directing Modell (who had suffered a heart attack and stroke in that same year) to sell his franchise.

In 2003, Modell sold the Ravens to minority owner and Maryland businessman Steve Bisciotti; under the deal, Modell retained a small interest (approximately 1% share) upon the team&#x27;s sale as a legal maneuver to avoid a claim by the Andrews trust, which was controlled by family of a former business adviser who sought to collect an estimated $30 million finder&#x27;s fee upon Modell&#x27;s sale of the team. The Andrews trust essentially claimed that under a 1963 agreement, Modell owed a finder&#x27;s fee for his original purchase of the team which was to be paid when Modell sold his entire interest. In July 2005, Modell prevailed in court and defeated the Andrews trust&#x27;s claim. At the time of sale, the franchise&#x27;s worth was estimated at US$600 million.

Soon after Modell reconstituted his organization in Baltimore in 1996, he had sold a small minority interest to Bisciotti. However, Bisciotti had the option to buy the team fully in right (approximately 99%) until March 2004, this upon becoming a minority owner (about 45%) outright in 1999. On April 9, 2004, the NFL approved Bisciotti&#x27;s purchase of the majority stake in the club. Modell retained his 1% share and an office at the Ravens&#x27; headquarters in Owings Mills, Maryland, as a team consultant.

==Modell in popular culture==
The furious fan reaction to Modell&#x27;s planned move of the franchise to Baltimore has been lampooned and chronicled in many media circles, particularly in print and television. On the cover of the December 4, 1995, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; titled &quot;Battle for the Browns&quot;, there is a cartoon of Modell punching a Browns fan, adorned with a Browns Helmet/dog and dogbone mask, in the stomach. He was portrayed in the 2008 movie &quot;The Express: The Ernie Davis Story&quot;, which was about Syracuse running back and Browns draftee Ernie Davis.

An episode of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; (whose title character and titular actor is a native Clevelander) referenced Modell. During a party at Drew&#x27;s house, which featured many Cleveland personalities, former Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar asks Drew where the bathroom is. Drew directs Kosar to the bathroom, following with the instruction, &quot;Just don&#x27;t take a Modell.&quot;

==Personal life==
Modell&#x27;s only marriage was to Patricia Breslin, lasting from 1969 until her death in 2011. He adopted Breslin&#x27;s two sons, John and David, from her first marriage to actor David Orrick McDearmon (1914–1979). David would later work for the Browns/Ravens&#x27; franchise, eventually become team president and CEO before the team&#x27;s sale in 2004. As of 2009, Modell and his wife lived in Cockeysville, Maryland. They also retained residences in nearby Owings Mills, Maryland, where son David lived with his family, and Vero Beach, Florida. They had a total of six grandchildren. Patricia died on October 12, 2011, at the age of 80.

Although Modell later retired and had relinquished control of the Ravens, he is still hated in Cleveland, not only for moving the Browns, but also for his firing of head coach Paul Brown in 1963. Some consider the Browns&#x27; move and subsequent lawsuits as having cost Modell a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which is in Canton, Ohio, 60 miles south of Cleveland and part of the Cleveland television market and Browns&#x27; territorial rights.

==Death and legacy==
Modell had a history of coronary disease. He died on September 6, 2012, at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, at the age of 87 from natural causes. He had not returned to Cleveland before his death.

The Ravens dedicated the 2012 season to Modell. On Week 1, all team members wore an &quot;Art&quot; decal on their helmets, and for the rest of their season, they wore an &quot;Art&quot; patch on the left side of their jerseys. They would go on to win Super Bowl XLVII.

The Sunday following Modell&#x27;s death was also the opening weekend of the 2012 NFL season. Each team playing a home game was asked to hold a moment of silence in memory of Modell. However, after much discussion, the Browns elected not to hold a moment of silence, but rather a &quot;brief read over the public address system&quot;. Finally, at the request of David Modell, the Browns opted not to commemorate or even mention Modell during their pregame festivities to avoid a negative reaction from the team&#x27;s fans.

On July 23, 2014, a video surfaced on YouTube of an unidentified Browns fan desecrating the grave of Modell wearing a Lyle Alzado jersey by urinating on the grave through a catheter. Baltimore County filed charges for disorderly conduct at the request of Modell&#x27;s son David Modell once the fan was identified. The charges were dropped after the fan apologized and appeared on David Modell&#x27;s radio show.

Art Modell was the grandson of the founder of Modell&#x27;s Sporting Goods, Morris A. Modell, but had nothing to do with that company. Established in 1889, Modell&#x27;s was a Northeastern US retail chain that transitioned to online-only after a 2020 bankruptcy reorganization. When Modell Sporting Goods attempted to penetrate Maryland markets, it hoped that a perceived association with Art Modell&#x27;s Baltimore Ravens would be helpful, but ultimately they were unsuccessful.

<doc id="259102" wikidata="Q5139116" url="?curid=259102" title="Coca wine">
<text>Coca wine is an alcoholic beverage combining wine with cocaine. One popular brand was &quot;Vin Mariani&quot;, developed in 1863 by French-Corsican chemist and entrepreneur Angelo Mariani.

At the end of the 19th century, the fear of drug abuse made coca-based drinks less popular. This led to the prohibition of cocaine in the United States in 1914 via the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, and the removal of cocaine from coca wine, though coca leaf remained. Coca wine itself became illegal in the United States when its other main drug, alcohol, was banned just a few years later with the Eighteenth Amendment in 1920.

==Related beverages==
In Atlanta, John Pemberton, a pharmacist, developed a beverage based on Vin Mariani, called Pemberton&#x27;s French Wine Coca. It proved popular among American consumers. In 1886, when Georgia introduced Prohibition, Pemberton had to replace the wine in his recipe with non-alcoholic syrup. The new recipe became Coca-Cola.

==Physiological effects==
The combination of cocaine and alcohol leads to the formation of cocaethylene in the body. Studies suggest the compound decreases the feelings of drunkenness from alcohol alone and heightens euphoric sensations, but is also potentially cardiotoxic, more so than either cocaine or alcohol alone.

<doc id="259105" wikidata="Q3150644" url="?curid=259105" title="Independence of irrelevant alternatives">
<text>Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) is an axiom of decision theory which codifies the intuition that a choice between formula_1 and formula_2 should not depend on the quality of a third, unrelated outcome formula_3. There are several different variations of this axiom, which are generally equivalent under mild conditions. As a result of its importance, the axiom has been independently rediscovered in various forms across a wide variety of fields, including economics, cognitive science, social choice, fair division, rational choice, artificial intelligence, probability, and game theory. It is closely tied to many of the most important theorems in these fields, including Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem, the Balinski–Young theorem, and the money pump arguments.

In behavioral economics, failures of IIA (caused by irrationality) are called menu effects or menu dependence. 

== Motivation ==
This is sometimes explained with a short story by philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser:Morgenbesser, ordering dessert, is told by a waitress that he can choose between blueberry or apple pie. He orders apple. Soon the waitress comes back and explains cherry pie is also an option. Morgenbesser replies &quot;In that case, I&#x27;ll have blueberry.&quot;IIA rules out this kind of arbitrary behavior, by stating that:
: If &quot;A(pple)&quot; is chosen over &quot;B(lueberry)&quot; in the choice set {&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;}, introducing a third option &quot;C(herry)&quot; must not result in &quot;B&quot; being chosen over &quot;A&quot;.
== By field ==
=== Economics ===
In economics, the axiom is connected to the theory of revealed preferences. Economists often invoke IIA when building descriptive (positive) models of to ensure agents have well-defined preferences that can be used for making testable predictions. If agents&#x27; behavior or preferences are allowed to change depending on irrelevant circumstances, any model could be made unfalsifiable by claiming some irrelevant circumstance must have changed when repeating the experiment. Often, the axiom is justified by arguing that any irrational agent will be money pumped until going bankrupt, making their preferences unobservable or irrelevant to the rest of the economy.

==== Behavioral economics ====
While economists must often make do with assuming IIA for reasons of computation or to make sure they are addressing a well-posed problem, experimental economists have shown that real human decisions often violate IIA. For example, the decoy effect shows that inserting a $5 medium soda between a $3 small and $5.10 large can make customers perceive the large as a better deal (because it&#x27;s &quot;only 10 cents more than the medium&quot;). Behavioral economics introduces models that weaken or remove many assumptions of consumer rationality, including IIA. This provides greater accuracy, at the cost of making the model more complex and more difficult to falsify.

=== Social choice ===
In social choice theory, independence of irrelevant alternatives is often stated as &quot;if one candidate (formula_4) would win an election without a new candidate (formula_5), and formula_5 is added to the ballot, then either formula_4 or formula_5 should win the election.&quot; Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem shows that no reasonable (non-random, non-dictatorial) ranked voting system can satisfy IIA. However, Arrow&#x27;s theorem does not apply to rated voting methods. These can pass IIA under certain assumptions, but fail it if they are not met.

Methods that unconditionally pass IIA include sortition and random dictatorship.

==== Common voting methods ====
Deterministic voting methods that behave like majority rule when there are only two candidates can be shown to fail IIA by the use of a Condorcet cycle:

Consider a scenario in which there are three candidates formula_1, formula_2, and formula_11, and the voters&#x27; preferences are as follows:

: 25% of the voters prefer formula_1 over formula_2, and formula_2 over formula_11. (formula_16)
: 40% of the voters prefer formula_2 over formula_11, and formula_11 over formula_1. (formula_21)
: 35% of the voters prefer formula_11 over formula_1, and formula_1 over formula_2. (formula_26)

(These are preferences, not votes, and thus are independent of the voting method.)

75% prefer formula_11 over formula_1, 65% prefer formula_2 over formula_11, and 60% prefer formula_1 over formula_2. The presence of this societal intransitivity is the voting paradox. Regardless of the voting method and the actual votes, there are only three cases to consider:

* Case 1: formula_1 is elected. IIA is violated because the 75% who prefer formula_11 over formula_1 would elect formula_11 if formula_2 were not a candidate.
* Case 2: formula_2 is elected. IIA is violated because the 60% who prefer formula_1 over formula_2 would elect formula_1 if formula_11 were not a candidate.
* Case 3: formula_11 is elected. IIA is violated because the 65% who prefer formula_2 over formula_11 would elect formula_2 if formula_1 were not a candidate.

For particular voting methods, the following results hold:

* Instant-runoff voting, the Kemeny–Young method, the Minimax Condorcet method, Ranked Pairs, top-two runoff, First-past-the-post, and the Schulze method all elect formula_2 in the scenario above, and thus fail IIA after formula_11 is removed.
* The Borda count and Bucklin voting both elect formula_11 in the scenario above, and thus fail IIA after formula_1 is removed.
* Copeland&#x27;s method returns a three-way tie, but can be shown to fail IIA by going in the opposite direction. If formula_1 were not a candidate, then formula_2 would win outright. Introducing formula_1 changes the outcome into a three-way tie. So the introduction of formula_1 makes formula_11 no longer a loser, which is a failure.

==== Rated methods ====

Generalizations of Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem show that if the voters change their rating scales depending on the candidates who are running, the outcome of cardinal voting may still be affected by the presence of non-winning candidates. Approval voting, score voting, and median voting may satisfy the IIA criterion if it is assumed that voters rate candidates individually and independently of knowing the available alternatives in the election, using their own absolute scale. If voters do not behave in accordance with this assumption, then those methods also fail the IIA criterion.

Balinski and Laraki disputed that any interpersonal comparisons are required for rated voting rules to pass IIA. They argue the availability of a common language with verbal grades is sufficient for IIA by allowing voters to give consistent responses to questions about candidate quality. In other words, they argue most voters will not change their beliefs about whether a candidate is &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, or &quot;neutral&quot; simply because another candidate joins or drops out of a race.

== Criticism of IIA ==
Arguments have been made that IIA is itself an undesirable and/or unrealistic criteria. IIA is largely incompatible with the majority criterion unless there are only two alternatives and the vast majority of voting systems fail the criteria. The satisfaction of IIA by Approval and Range voting rests on making an unrealistic assumption that voters who have meaningful preferences between two alternatives, but would approve or rate those two alternatives the same in an election with other irrelevant alternatives, would necessarily either cast a vote in which both alternatives are still approved or rated the same, or abstain, even in an election between only those two alternatives. If it is assumed to be at least possible that any voter having preferences might not abstain, or vote their favorite and least favorite candidates at differing ratings respectively, then these systems would also fail IIA. Allowing either of these conditions alone causes approval and range voting to fail IIA. 

The satisfaction of IIA leaves only voting methods that have undesirable in some other way, such as treating one of the voters as a dictator, or requires making unrealistic assumptions about voter behavior. 

=== In individual choice ===

Amartya Sen argued that seemingly independent alternatives could provide context for individual choice, and thus that menu dependence might not be irrational.

As an example, he described a person considering whether to take an apple out of a basket without being greedy. If the only two options available are &quot;take the apple&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t take the apple&quot;, this person may conclude that there is only one apple left and so refrain from taking the last apple as they don&#x27;t want to be greedy. However, if a third option &quot;take another apple&quot; were available, that would provide context that there are more apples in the basket, and they would then be free to take the first apple.

<text>The Order of the Phoenix is a fictional organisation in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of novels by J. K. Rowling. Founded by Albus Dumbledore to fight Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, the Order lends its name to the fifth book of the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. The original members of the Order of the Phoenix include Sirius Black, Emmeline Vance, Benjy Fenwick, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Edgar Bones, Lily Potter, James Potter, Sturgis Podmore, Caradoc Dearborn, Alice Longbottom, Frank Longbottom, Dorcas Meadowes, Albus Dumbledore, Rubeus Hagrid, Hestia Jones, Remus Lupin, Severus Snape, Aberforth Dumbledore, Dedalus Diggle, Minerva McGonagall and Marlene McKinnon.

== Synopsis ==
Before the chronology of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novel series starts, the character Lord Voldemort declared war on the Wizarding World. Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts, attempted to stop Voldemort by founding the Order of the Phoenix. Several characters joined the organisation, seeking to prevent Voldemort from taking over the Wizarding World and establishing a tyrannical new world order. During this period, before the events of the &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, the Order sustained heavy losses, including the murders of minor characters such as the Prewetts, the Bones and the McKinnons. The Longbottoms were also tortured to insanity at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange.

Voldemort&#x27;s first reign of terror ended after the murders of James and Lily Potter, and the unsuccessful attempt to murder their son, Harry Potter, at the beginning of the series. The spell rebounded on to him and severely diminished Voldemort&#x27;s powers and, as a result, the Order was temporarily disbanded due to the lack of any further threat.

When Harry reported that Voldemort had returned, towards the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Dumbledore reactivated the Order. Many of the original members returned and were soon joined by recruits who effectively replaced those who had died in service during the first conflict. The Order established their headquarters at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black&#x27;s family home, during the interval between the fourth and fifth books in the series. Dumbledore was the Secret-Keeper for the Order, meaning that only he could reveal the location of the Order&#x27;s headquarters to others. Dumbledore&#x27;s death in book six made the location vulnerable and it was abandoned in favour of The Burrow as a result.

The Order led the fight against Voldemort in the fifth instalment while Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge refused to accept the return of Voldemort. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, some Order members take turns guarding Sybill Trelawney&#x27;s prophecy, which referred to Voldemort&#x27;s downfall and Harry&#x27;s role in defeating him. Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts Grounds Keeper and an original Member of the Order, was accompanied by Olympe Maxime in an attempt to recruit the giants to the Order&#x27;s cause. Some members also participated in a battle at the Department of Mysteries near the end of the fifth book. Order members patrolled Hogwarts, the Wizarding school, on the night of Dumbledore&#x27;s death in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, fighting the Death Eaters who managed to enter the castle.

In the series finale, attention turns to escorting the Death Eaters&#x27; main target, Harry Potter, from his summer home with the Dursleys to the Weasleys&#x27; Burrow. Later in the novel, after Voldemort&#x27;s takeover of the Ministry had succeeded, some Order members hosted &quot;Potterwatch&quot;, a secret pirate radio programme providing news on the Wizarding World that Voldemort&#x27;s regime did not want the general population to know. During the climax of the book, most of the Order, aided by Dumbledore&#x27;s Army, the Hogwarts staff and the older students, Slytherin house members included, fought against the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts, in which several Order members and other allies lost their lives.

==Members==

===Original Order===
The following characters were members of the Order of the Phoenix during Voldemort&#x27;s initial rise to power and several years prior to the events of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. Many of these characters later serve as members of the revived Order.
===Revived Order===
These characters joined the Order when Dumbledore revived it after Lord Voldemort&#x27;s return at the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;.
==Order members==
This is a list of notable members of the Order of the Phoenix. Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Fred and George Weasley have their own pages, and Peter Pettigrew is listed under Death Eater.

===Fleur Delacour===
Fleur Isabelle Weasley (née Delacour) is a student of Beauxbatons Academy in France, and is selected as a champion of the Triwizard Tournament. Her maternal grandmother is a Veela, from whom Fleur inherited her silvery-blonde hair, pale eyes, good looks, and ability to enchant men. Fleur finishes in 4th place in the Triwizard Tournament due to being Stunned during the last task.

In the following year, Fleur works at Gringotts with Bill Weasley, and the pair become engaged. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Fleur and Bill have their wedding and reception at the Burrow, but the event is interrupted when Death Eaters attack.

They begin married life in a house on a beach in Wales called Shell Cottage. Fleur and Bill allow Ron to stay with them after he walks out on Harry and Hermione during their hunt for Horcruxes. The newlyweds later provide a safe haven for the trio and others rescued from Malfoy Manor at Shell Cottage. Both Bill and Fleur are combatants for the Order during the Battle of Hogwarts and manage to survive it. The couple go on to have three children: Victoire, Dominique and Louis.

French actress and model Clémence Poésy portrays Fleur in the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; and both parts of the &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; film adaptation.

===Aberforth Dumbledore===
Aberforth Dumbledore is Albus Dumbledore&#x27;s younger brother. His first appearance is in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. After his parents&#x27; deaths and Albus&#x27; return home to look after their unstable sister Ariana, Aberforth quarrels with his brother and his brother&#x27;s friend, Gellert Grindelwald, over their plans to start a new order, neglecting Ariana. Grindelwald began torturing him, leading to the three dueling. This argument results in Ariana&#x27;s accidental death at the hands of one of them. At Ariana&#x27;s funeral, Aberforth publicly confronts Albus and strikes him, breaking his nose. Eventually, Aberforth becomes the owner and barman of the Hog&#x27;s Head inn. He is known for his strong affinity with goats. His Patronus takes the form of a goat, and he recounts to the trio that as a boy he fed the goats in company with his sister, Ariana. Aberforth was also tried before the Wizengamot (the Wizard High Court), for performing inappropriate charms on a goat. His tavern also, according to Harry&#x27;s description in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, has a faint smell of goats. In the film adaptation, a bleating goat can be seen shuffling about in the back of the pub.

It is not until &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; that Aberforth plays an important role in the series by taking Harry, Ron, and Hermione into his bar before the Death Eaters can capture them. Aberforth later reveals to the trio some facts they did not know about the history of the Dumbledore family. While being held prisoner in Malfoy Manor, Harry briefly glimpses Aberforth&#x27;s eye in the remaining shard of the two-way mirror he was given by Sirius and calls for Aberforth&#x27;s help. Aberforth bought its counterpart from Mundungus Fletcher. Using the mirror to watch over the trio, Aberforth sends Dobby to rescue them and the other prisoners from the Manor. He liked Dobby and was upset to hear Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.

Aberforth allows the resistance fighters to use a secure passageway from the Hog&#x27;s Head to the Room of Requirement through Ariana&#x27;s portrait, it being the only unguarded entrance into Hogwarts. This passage is used to evacuate underage students from Hogwarts and, according to Neville, it was also used by members of Dumbledore&#x27;s Army to get food when they were living in the Room of Requirement because that is one thing the Room of Requirement would not do. Aberforth leaves the Order, believing the war against Voldemort is lost. However, he quickly joins the Battle of Hogwarts and is last seen Stunning Augustus Rookwood. According to Rowling, Aberforth survives the battle, and is still &quot;at the Hog&#x27;s Head, playing with his goats&quot;.

He also appears in &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot; in which it is revealed that he has an illegitimate son named Aurelius Dumbledore as he had an affair with a woman who also lived in Godric&#x27;s Hollow. She gave birth to Aurelius but, after sailing on a ship, the child was switched with Corvus Lestrange V by Leta Lestrange. Corvus and Aurelius&#x27;s mother drowned, but Aurelius was adopted by Mary Lou Barebone who named him Credence Barebone. Years later, Credence transforms into an Obscurus and joins Gellert Grindelwald as he reveals his true identity to him. Credence returns to home with Aberforth when Grindelwald tried to kill him as he foils the latter&#x27;s plan.

Jim McManus appeared briefly as Aberforth in the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. Ciarán Hinds plays Aberforth in a larger role in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;. Richard Coyle plays the middle-aged version of the character in the third &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; film, &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot;.

===Arabella Figg===
Arabella Doreen Figg, better known simply as Mrs. Figg, is a Squib living undercover as a Muggle and on Dumbledore&#x27;s orders surreptitiously watches over Harry while he is at home with the Dursleys. She is a Chekhov gun, first mentioned as a seemingly insignificant neighbour in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and not revealed as a member of the magical community until &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;. She has a lifelong love of cats and does &quot;a roaring trade&quot; in crossbred cats and Kneazles, their magical variant. Within the Order of the Phoenix, she functions as one of Dumbledore&#x27;s liaisons between the magical and Muggle worlds. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, she aids Harry after he and his cousin Dudley Dursley are attacked by two Dementors, and chooses to reveal herself to him. She explains to Harry that she deliberately made Harry&#x27;s stays with her unpleasant so that the Dursleys would continue to send him to her, though she would have preferred to do otherwise. When the Ministry of Magic tries to have Harry expelled from Hogwarts for underage use of magic (after he cast a Patronus charm to protect himself and his cousin), her testimony before the Wizengamot is crucial in allowing Harry to stay at Hogwarts. However, according to Rowling, Squibs are incapable of seeing Dementors, and it is suggested by her manner during the trial that she has been prompted what to say with regard to the Dementors. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, she attends Dumbledore&#x27;s funeral at Hogwarts.

Mrs. Figg is portrayed by Kathryn Hunter in the film adaptation of &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

===Mundungus Fletcher===
Mundungus Fletcher is mentioned in passing in some of the earlier books in the series, but it is not until the second chapter of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; that he makes his first appearance. The text describes Mundungus as a &quot;squat, unshaven man&quot; with &quot;short, bandy legs&quot;, &quot;long, straggly ginger hair&quot;, and &quot;bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound&quot;. He is involved in many illegal activities, yet he seems confined to relatively minor crimes, such as theft and trading stolen goods on the black market. Many members of the Order have mixed feelings about him, but he is very loyal to Dumbledore, who once got him out of serious trouble. His connections enable him to hear rumours and information circulating in the shadier segments of the Wizarding population - data with the potential to prove instrumental in the fight against Voldemort.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Mundungus has managed to get out of prison, but the circumstances are unclear. He is confunded by Snape, and gives the idea of using the Polyjuice Potion and six Potter decoys to the Order and helps with the escort of Harry from Privet Drive. He travels with Mad-Eye Moody on a broomstick as one of the Potter decoys. During the flight from Privet Drive, he flees when Voldemort himself shows up. Kreacher later reveals that the property which Mundungus stole from 12 Grimmauld Place in the previous book included a heavy locket from the drawing room. That locket was Slytherin&#x27;s locket Horcrux. Harry sends Kreacher to capture Mundungus, who reveals that Umbridge took the locket from him under threat of arrest.

Andy Linden plays Mundungus Fletcher in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;.

=== Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody ===
Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody is perhaps the most famous Auror in the modern times of the Wizarding World, single-handedly responsible for capturing numerous wizard criminals. Moody&#x27;s face is badly scarred; he has lost several body parts while fighting Dark wizards, including his left eye, lower left leg, and part of his nose. He has replaced his missing eye with a magical one that can rotate 360 degrees and see through almost everything (including walls, doors, Invisibility Cloaks, and the back of his own head). He walks with a pronounced limp due to his prosthetic leg and uses a walking staff. He frequently exclaims &quot;Constant vigilance!&quot; to encourage wizards to be on their guard against the dark arts, and keeps a number of devices in his office to alert him to the presence of potential enemies. Before his retirement from the Aurors&#x27; Office, he was Nymphadora Tonks&#x27; mentor.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Moody is appointed as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, coming out of retirement as a favour to Dumbledore. Shortly before the school year begins, however, Moody is attacked by Barty Crouch, Jr., who subdues him with the Imperius Curse and takes Polyjuice Potion to assume his appearance. He keeps the real Moody alive as a source both of Polyjuice potion ingredients and of personal information helpful in putting the impersonation over and takes Moody&#x27;s place at Hogwarts. Moody&#x27;s well-known habit of carrying around his own drinks in a private hip flask allows Crouch to take the Polyjuice Potion as needed to sustain the masquerade without raising suspicion.

After Harry unexpectedly returns alive from the graveyard battle with Voldemort, Crouch/Moody takes Harry back to his office, questions him about Voldemort and what happened in the graveyard, and reveals that he is working for Voldemort. He then prepares to kill Harry, but Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape stop him. Having neglected to take his hourly dose of Polyjuice potion, Crouch transforms back to his own appearance and, under the influence of Veritaserum, confesses everything. Dumbledore then rescues the real Moody from his magic trunk.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, the real Moody has joined the newly re-formed Order and leads the party transferring Harry from 4 Privet Drive to Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He appears at the climax of that book, arriving at the battle at the Department of Mysteries after being tipped off by Snape. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; he is killed by Voldemort. Moody is portrayed by Brendan Gleeson in the film series.

===James Potter===
James Potter, nicknamed Prongs, is the father of Harry Potter and husband of Lily Potter. James met Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew when they entered Hogwarts. When James, Sirius, and Peter discovered that Remus is, in fact, a werewolf, the three of them illegally learned to become Animagi to accompany Remus safely during his transformations and keep him under control. It is during this time that they discovered almost all the secret passageways of Hogwarts and designed the Marauder&#x27;s Map. At school, James is said to have been a talented player on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.

Rowling describes James and Harry as having similar attributes: the same thin face, the same untidy black hair, and about the same height at school age. Rowling also describes James as having hazel eyes. Like Harry, James is generally described to be a good, loyal friend who &quot;regarded it as the height of dishonour to mistrust his friends&quot;. Characters in the books sometimes comment negatively on James&#x27; personality, about which Rowling comments that &quot;there was a lot of good in James&quot;.

His popularity was not universal, as a mutual hatred sprang up between him and Snape. Snape constantly tells Harry that James was &quot;exceedingly arrogant&quot;, and on one occasion, Sirius admits that he and James could sometimes be &quot;arrogant little &quot; but that &quot;James grew out of it&quot;. He became Head Boy in his seventh year.

In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, after seeing a scene from Snape&#x27;s memories within a Pensieve of a fifteen-year-old James and Sirius bullying Snape, Harry agrees with Snape&#x27;s assessment of his father&#x27;s arrogance. According to Dumbledore in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, James and Snape shared a rivalry not unlike that of Draco and Harry. In addition, Lupin tells Harry that Snape &quot;never lost an opportunity to curse James&quot;. According to an interview with Rowling, &quot;James always suspected Snape harboured deeper feelings for Lily, which was a factor in James&#x27; behaviour to Snape.&quot; In contrast, when Sirius attempts to lure Snape into the Shrieking Shack where Lupin stays during his werewolf transformations, James prevents him from entering the tunnel under the Whomping Willow, thus saving Snape&#x27;s life.

After graduating from Hogwarts, James – along with Lily and his friends – become &quot;full-time fighters&quot; for the Order, and do not hold regular jobs, supporting his family and Lupin, whose status as a werewolf made him unemployable, on family gold. In an interview, Rowling revealed that James and Lily were asked by Voldemort to join the Death Eaters, but refused, making it &quot;one strike against them before they were even out of their teens&quot;. When his son Harry becomes Voldemort&#x27;s target, the Potters go into hiding and name Pettigrew as their secret keeper. However, on 31 October 1981, the Potters&#x27; whereabouts are betrayed by Pettigrew, and they are attacked by Voldemort without warning at their home in Godric&#x27;s Hollow. James urges his wife to take Harry and run while he holds Voldemort off. Wandless, he is killed.

James and Sirius are the heroes of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; prequel, an 800-word story set three years before Harry&#x27;s birth. The two friends are riding Sirius&#x27; motorbike and are chased by two Muggle policemen for breaking the speed limit. The policemen attempt to arrest them when three Death Eaters on broomsticks fly down towards them. James and Sirius use the police car as a barrier and the Death Eaters crash into it. In the end, they escape from the policemen by flying away on the motorbike.

In the film series, James is portrayed by Adrian Rawlins as an adult, Robbie Jarvis as a teenager and Alfie McIlwain as a child.

===Lily Potter===

Lily J. Potter (née Evans) is the mother of Harry Potter. She is described as being very pretty, with startlingly green almond-shaped eyes and thick, long, dark auburn hair. She is one of the &quot;all-time favorite students&quot; of star collector Horace Slughorn, who describes her as &quot;vivacious&quot;, &quot;charming&quot;, &quot;cheeky&quot;, and &quot;very funny&quot; and recalls that he &quot;often told her she should have been in Slytherin&quot;. In addition, Slughorn says Lily is one of the brightest students he ever taught, with a natural and intuitive ability at Potions. Rowling describes Lily as being &quot;a bit of a catch&quot;; she was a popular girl for whom many boys had romantic feelings. Although Lily is Muggle-born, she is an extremely gifted witch at the top of her class. She became Head Girl in her seventh year. Lily&#x27;s sister Petunia Dursley despised her for being a witch and viewed her as a &quot;freak&quot;, although Petunia is later revealed to have been envious of her abilities. Rowling stated that Lily did receive warning letters for testing the limits of the Statute of Secrecy. Lily&#x27;s Patronus is a doe, presumably to pair with James&#x27; Animagus shape of a stag (also the form of Harry&#x27;s Patronus).

After witnessing a memory from Snape about Lily&#x27;s and James&#x27; time as Hogwarts students, Harry gathers the impression that Lily hated James, but Sirius and Lupin assure him that she did not; they &quot;simply got off on the wrong foot&quot;, because Snape and James hated each other, and Snape was Lily&#x27;s best friend at the time, despite him sorting into Slytherin. Rowling confirmed this view when asked how Lily and James had fallen in love if Lily hated him. Lupin tells Harry that after James matured, Lily started seeing him in their seventh year. Rowling later echoed Lupin&#x27;s words, describing it as James having to &quot;[tone] down some of his more &#x27;bombastic&#x27; behavior&quot;. They married soon after leaving Hogwarts, with Sirius as best man at their wedding.

The old, pre-Hogwarts friendship between Lily and Snape is fully revealed in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, along with the fact that Snape harboured unrequited romantic feelings for Lily from childhood. Rowling states that while Lily loved Snape as a friend, she might have returned those romantic feelings if Snape had not become so seriously involved in the Dark Arts. Their relationship ends in their fifth year at Hogwarts, when Snape, in his anger and humiliation at being jinxed by James and Sirius, unthinkingly calls Lily a &quot;Mudblood&quot; after she defended him.

After leaving Hogwarts, Snape becomes a Death Eater and informs Voldemort of half of an overheard prophecy, which Voldemort takes to refer to Lily and her son, Harry. Fearing for Lily&#x27;s life, Snape joins the Order as a spy for Dumbledore, in exchange for what he hopes will be Dumbledore&#x27;s protection of Lily. Voldemort offers Lily the chance to step aside before he kills Harry because of Snape&#x27;s request to spare Lily&#x27;s life, but Lily refuses and Voldemort kills her. The result of her selfless act of love manifests itself two ways: when Voldemort attempted to kill Harry with the Killing Curse the spell backfired, rendering Voldemort non-corporeal. The lingering protection afforded to Harry by Lily&#x27;s sacrifice rendered Voldemort unable to touch him physically. The second way in which Harry is protected by Lily&#x27;s sacrifice occurs when Petunia takes Harry in. Dumbledore tells Harry that Lily&#x27;s protection was extended to Privet Drive because Lily and Petunia are related by blood. This protection ends when Harry comes of age at 17.

Though Harry bears a great resemblance to his father, it is often noted that he has Lily&#x27;s eyes. Dumbledore has said that Harry&#x27;s deepest nature is much more similar to his mother&#x27;s. In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that &quot;he has his mother&#x27;s eyes, and that&#x27;s very important in a future book&quot;. That future book was &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. In Snape&#x27;s death scene in that novel, after having passed on his memories to Harry, he whispers to Harry: &quot;Look... at... me...&quot; In one of Snape&#x27;s memories, it is revealed that Dumbledore persuades Snape to protect Harry after Lily&#x27;s death by mentioning the fact that he has &quot;precisely&quot; the same eyes as his mother. His last words to Harry were simply a desire to see Lily&#x27;s eyes before he died.

Harry&#x27;s dead parents are seen five times in the books (not counting their appearances in numerous magical photographs). Firstly in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone,&quot; Harry sees James and Lily in the Mirror of Erised. Secondly during Harry&#x27;s struggle with Voldemort in &quot;Goblet of Fire,&quot; they appear momentarily, along with other victims killed by Voldemort&#x27;s wand. They appear in Snape&#x27;s memories in both &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, and finally in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; when Harry makes his self-sacrificing walk into the Forbidden Forest, determined to let Voldemort kill him without offering resistance, Harry&#x27;s parents walk at his side and Lily tells him how proud they are of him.

In an interview conducted by Daniel Radcliffe, Rowling revealed that Lily Potter&#x27;s maiden name, Evans, was based on the real name of the author George Eliot, Mary Anne Evans.

Lily is portrayed by Geraldine Somerville as an adult in the film series, and by Susie Shinner as a teenager and Ellie Darcey-Alden as a child.

===Kingsley Shacklebolt===
Kingsley Shacklebolt is a senior Auror who acts as informer for the Order within the Ministry of Magic. He is first introduced in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, when he volunteers to be one of the members of the Advance Guard that escorted Harry from the Dursleys&#x27; home to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Kingsley is in charge of the search for Sirius in the Ministry; however, knowing Sirius is innocent, he is supplying the Ministry false information that Sirius is in Tibet. He is present in the scene of the fifth book when Harry is confronted about Dumbledore&#x27;s Army, after Marietta Edgecombe betrays it to Dolores Umbridge. Kingsley swiftly modifies Marietta&#x27;s memory, but to avoid suspicion from the Ministry, Dumbledore is forced to hex him too as he flees.

Kingsley takes part in the battle at the Department of Mysteries and appears to be very skilled at duelling as he is seen fighting two Death Eaters at once. However, after Sirius is killed, he continues the duel with Bellatrix Lestrange, during which Kingsley is hit by a spell that causes a &quot;loud bang&quot; and he hits the ground &quot;yelling in pain&quot;. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, appoints Kingsley to the Muggle Prime Minister&#x27;s office, posing as a secretary, but being the Prime Minister&#x27;s guard.

It is revealed in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; that Kingsley is one of the few wizards that the Dursleys seem to like, due to his skill at blending in well with Muggles and his calm, collected demeanour. In that book, Kingsley first appears with other Order members to move Harry from the Dursleys&#x27; home to safety in the Burrow. Later in the book, he manages to send a timely warning to Bill and Fleur&#x27;s wedding using his Patronus, a lynx, when Voldemort overthrows the Ministry of Magic, giving the guests a chance to escape. He continues to guard the Prime Minister but is eventually forced to flee. He later is heard preaching equal rights for Muggles and Wizards on the pirate radio programme &quot;Potterwatch&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Royal&quot;. In the Battle of Hogwarts, he is first seen organising those who remained to fight. He is later seen dueling an unnamed Death Eater, and ends up duelling Voldemort himself, alongside Minerva McGonagall and Horace Slughorn, but after Bellatrix&#x27;s death, Voldemort&#x27;s anger erupts; Kingsley and the two others are defeated (although not killed). Kingsley is appointed temporary Minister for Magic following the death of Voldemort and the deposition of Voldemort&#x27;s puppet ruler, Pius Thicknesse. However, it was later revealed by Rowling in an interview that Kingsley did become the new Minister permanently, revolutionising the Ministry itself.

George Harris appeared as Kingsley in the movies &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; and both parts of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

=== Nymphadora Tonks ===

Nymphadora Tonks is a Metamorphmagus and an Auror. Her name means &quot;Gift of the Nymphs&quot;. She despises her first name and prefers to be called by her surname alone. She is still referred to as &quot;Tonks&quot; by her peers even after her marriage.

She is described as having &quot;a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes&quot;, and is usually depicted with different hair colours, which she can change at will. Tonks is seen to be notoriously clumsy and unskilled at household spells. Nymphadora is the only daughter of Ted and Andromeda Tonks, the latter being sister to Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy; Nymphadora is therefore Draco Malfoy&#x27;s first cousin yet she never addresses him as family, alluding to him simply as &quot;the Malfoy boy&quot;. Tonks is sorted into Hufflepuff, and graduates from Hogwarts one year before Harry enters, after which she begins three years of Auror training; under Moody&#x27;s tutelage, she qualifies as an Auror one year before her first appearance in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

Tonks and Kingsley act as spies for the Order in the Ministry. She helps to escort Harry first from the Dursleys&#x27; house to Order headquarters, and later to the Hogwarts Express. Tonks later fights the Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries, in which she is injured by Bellatrix, and has to be taken to St Mungo&#x27;s. During &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Tonks is stationed at Hogsmeade and assigned to guard Hogwarts. Harry observes she is constantly depressed and rarely smiles. Also, he sees her hair is a mousy brown instead of its usual bright bubble-gum pink. After Dumbledore&#x27;s death, it is revealed that Tonks has fallen in love with Lupin, and her Patronus has, as a result, changed to the form of a wolf. Lupin is reluctant to return her affections arguing that he is &quot;too old, too poor, and too dangerous&quot; for her. Because of this, she falls into a depression that disturbs her magical abilities including her ability to change her appearance at will.

However, early in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Tonks announces that she has recently married Remus Lupin. Tonks accompanies twelve Order members to take Harry from the Dursleys&#x27; home to The Burrow. She flies with Ron, who impersonates Harry using Polyjuice Potion to throw the Death Eaters off the real Harry&#x27;s trail. During the aerial battle, Tonks fights Bellatrix again and injures Bellatrix&#x27;s husband, Rodolphus. Later in the book, Remus reveals Tonks is pregnant. He leaves her for a brief period, believing that he, through their marriage, has caused her to become an outcast and their unborn child would be better off without him, but changes his mind and returns to her side after a heated argument with Harry. In April of the seventh book, Tonks gives birth to Teddy Remus Lupin, named after her father and husband. Towards the end of the book, Tonks and Lupin join the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Tonks is killed by Bellatrix, and Lupin is killed by Antonin Dolohov, leaving Teddy an orphan to be raised by his maternal grandmother, Andromeda. In an interview shortly after the release of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Rowling confessed that she had originally intended for Tonks and Lupin to survive the series ending, but felt that she had to kill them after she spared Arthur Weasley in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

Natalia Tena played Tonks in the film versions of &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; and both parts of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

===Arthur Weasley===
Arthur Weasley is married to Molly Weasley, with whom he has seven children, including Ron, Harry&#x27;s best friend. Arthur is described as being tall and thin, and as having a receding hairline and horn-rimmed glasses. An affable, light-hearted man, he tends not to be the authority figure in the family; his wife Molly handles that area. Arthur works for the Ministry of Magic, initially in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. He is obsessed with learning about Muggle customs and inventions and owns a large collection of mostly Muggle used items. 

Mr. Weasley first appears in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, when Harry stays with the Weasley family at The Burrow during the summer before the first term of Hogwarts begins. In this book, Lucius Malfoy tries to discredit Arthur when Harry and Ron are seen flying his enchanted car and by placing Tom Riddle&#x27;s diary in Ginny&#x27;s cauldron so that she can open the Chamber of Secrets and take the blame for the attacks on Muggle-borns. However, Lucius fails to fulfil his objective and the diary is destroyed.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, it seems that Arthur does not fully believe the stories of Harry&#x27;s abuse at the hands of the Dursleys until he witnesses what they think about Harry and the Wizarding World and is stunned to see them so eager to say goodbye to him, before taking him to the Quidditch World Cup. At the beginning of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Mr. Weasley is a member of the Order and accompanies Harry to his visit to the Ministry. During one of his shifts in the Ministry guarding Sybill Trelawney&#x27;s prophecy, Voldemort&#x27;s pet snake Nagini attacks him. Harry, who is mentally connected with Voldemort, manages to see this in a vision and is able to warn the Hogwarts authorities. Arthur is subsequently saved just in time and sent to St Mungo&#x27;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, where he fully recovers. Rowling has revealed that in the original draft for &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; she planned to kill Arthur. She changed her mind, however, saying that she could not kill Arthur as he is one of the few good fathers in the series. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Arthur appears in the Battle of Hogwarts, in which he loses his son Fred, and is joined by Percy Weasley in defeating Pius Thicknesse.

Arthur Weasley appears in every film except the first and is portrayed by Mark Williams.

===Bill Weasley===
William Arthur &quot;Bill&quot; Weasley is the eldest born son of Arthur and Molly Weasley. He is described to be &quot;hard-working&quot; and &quot;down-to-earth&quot;, but possesses a fondness for &quot;a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour&quot;. During his time at Hogwarts, Bill becomes both a prefect and Head Boy. Later, he works for Gringotts Bank in Egypt as a Curse-Breaker.

He makes his first full appearance in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, where he is described as being a good-looking young man, sporting long red hair tied back in a ponytail and a single fang earring. When he and Mrs Weasley pay a visit to Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament, Fleur eyes him with &quot;great interest&quot;. Bill returns to Britain to work with the Order in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. He meets Fleur at Gringotts head office in London where she is employed at the time, giving her lessons to improve her English. After a year-long relationship, the couple gets engaged.

Bill fights against the Death Eaters&#x27; attack at Hogwarts near the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, where he is attacked by werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who disfigures him. As Greyback was in human form at the time of the attack, Bill suffers only partial lycanthropy contamination—permanent scarring of his face, and an acquired liking for very rare beef. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; Fleur and Bill take part in getting Harry escorted safely from the Dursleys&#x27; house. The couple have their wedding there and later provide a safe haven for the trio and several others in their home, Shell Cottage. Both Bill and Fleur were combatants during the Battle of Hogwarts, and both survived the battle. Bill and Fleur later have three children: Victoire, Dominique and Louis.

Richard Fish appeared as Bill briefly in the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. Domhnall Gleeson, the son of actor Brendan Gleeson (Alastor Moody in the series), plays Bill Weasley in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; and the roller coaster ride &quot;Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts&quot; at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida.

===Charlie Weasley===
Charlie Weasley is the second son of Arthur and Molly Weasley and is described as having a build like that of his brothers Fred and George: shorter and stockier than Bill, Percy and Ron. He has a broad, good-natured face, which is slightly weather-beaten and very freckly. His arms are muscly, and one of them has a long shiny burn. While at Hogwarts, he was a prefect, a Quidditch Captain, and a legendary Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. His skills as a Seeker were so good that it was said, &quot;He could have been capped for England if he hadn&#x27;t gone off chasing dragons.&quot;

After school, Charlie chooses to go to Romania to work with dragons. At Harry, Ron and Hermione&#x27;s request, he takes Hagrid&#x27;s baby dragon, Norbert, an illegally hatched Norwegian Ridgeback, into his care in Harry&#x27;s first year, and he is part of a team of Dragon Keepers that brings four dragons of different breeds to Hogwarts in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; for the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament.

During the second rise of Voldemort, Charlie&#x27;s task in the Order is to try to rally support abroad. Charlie returns to the Burrow in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; to participate in his brother Bill&#x27;s wedding as best man. He enters the later part of the Battle of Hogwarts, alongside Horace Slughorn, at the head of reinforcements for the defenders, and survives the battle without serious injury. He does not marry or have children, since he &quot;preferred dragons to women&quot;, according to Rowling.

Alex Crockford appears briefly as Charlie in the film adaptation of &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;.

===Molly Weasley===
Molly Weasley (née Prewett) is the wife of Arthur Weasley. She is the mother of seven children, including Ron Weasley, who becomes Harry Potter&#x27;s best friend. Molly is born into the pure-blood Prewett family, being the sister of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. The character is first introduced in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, when she kindly tells Harry how to cross the barrier through to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. 

After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. At the beginning of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Molly and Arthur offer the Burrow as Order headquarters when Grimmauld Place is no longer safe. She feels immensely uncomfortable with the trio&#x27;s decision to drop out of Hogwarts and initially attempts to dissuade them from doing so. As the novel progresses, the family is forced to head for safety at Auntie Muriel&#x27;s home. At the end of the book, Molly and her entire family fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. She is devastated by the death of her son Fred and is pushed to the edge when Bellatrix Lestrange almost strikes Ginny with the Killing Curse. Enraged, she engages Bellatrix in an intense duel, killing her with a curse that hits her in the chest. Rowling has stated that the reason she had Molly kill Bellatrix was to show Molly&#x27;s great powers as a witch and to provide a contrast between Molly&#x27;s consumption with &quot;maternal love&quot; and Bellatrix&#x27;s with &quot;obsessive love&quot;.

&quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Courtney Crowder lists Molly Weasley as her favourite literary mother, describing her as the &quot;original Mama Grizzly&quot;, citing her many touching moments with Harry as well as the final book in the series, where &quot;her feelings jumped off the page&quot; as testament to her strong personality. Crowder summarises Molly&#x27;s character as &quot;levelheaded, yet willing to fight, intelligent, welcoming, and above all, extremely loving&quot;. In a Mother&#x27;s Day article Molly was also voted the third greatest celebrity mother by The Flowers and Plants association who see the character as &quot;formidable, practical, creative and resourceful&quot;. Bob Smietana of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; links Molly&#x27;s defence of Ginny in the final book into a wider theme in the series about the strength of parental love, which he feels to carry considerable emotional weight. &quot;Empire&quot; listed Molly Weasley 24th on their Top 30 &quot;Harry Potter&quot; characters. Novelist Stephen King notes that when Molly called Bellatrix a &quot;bitch&quot; after she sees the Death Eater trying to kill Ginny, it was &quot;the most shocking &quot;bitch&quot; in recent fiction&quot;, and that it shows how adult the books had become.

Julie Walters portrays Molly Weasley in every film except &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, in which her role in the novel is cut out. In 2003, BBC voted her portrayal of Molly as the second-&quot;best screen mother&quot;, behind Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich.

<text>The Carl Hamilton novels is a book series by Swedish author and journalist Jan Guillou centered on the fictional Swedish spy Carl Gustaf Gilbert Hamilton. The main character is an elite military officer working for the Swedish Security agency and Intelligence agency during the end of the Cold War, residing in Stockholm but active internationally.

Carl Hamilton has been called &quot;Sweden&#x27;s James Bond&quot;, but the plot of Guillou&#x27;s novels also has a heavy focus on politics and journalism. One commentator said the books &quot;... place [Guillou] besides John le Carré and Len Deighton&quot; (famous British spy novelists). The first novel was published in 1986 and the series is a best-seller in Sweden, with more than 10 million sold copies. The character of Carl Hamilton has also appeared in a number of film and television adaptations.

== Novels ==
Carl Hamilton is the main character of the first ten novels released between 1986 and 1995. He makes a return as a supporting character in the novels &quot;Madame Terror&quot; (2006) and &quot;Men inte om det gäller din dotter&quot; (2008). He also makes a short appearance as a minor character in &quot;De som dödar drömmar sover aldrig&quot; (2018) and &quot;Den andra dödssynden&quot; (2019).

==Concept and creation==
While working as a journalist in the early 1970s Jan Guillou had been convicted of espionage for exposing an illegal secret spy organization inside the Swedish military (see the IB affair). During his prison sentence in 1974, he read the crime novels about Martin Beck, written by his friends and fellow left wing writers Per Wahlöö and Maj Sjöwall, and this inspired him to write his own political crime novels. But instead of writing about the police he would write about the world of intelligence and counter-intelligence from the viewpoint of a Swedish spy, making use of his vast research and journalistic experience in this field.

Guillou had published his debut novel &quot;Om kriget kommer&quot; (&quot;If the War Comes&quot;) in 1971, some years before the IB affair, where the main character is also an officer in the Swedish military intelligence. But he didn&#x27;t begin writing on the new spy project until the mid-1980s, when a personal encounter with Norwegian security police in Oslo inspired him to the plot of the first novel. Many years after the IB affair, Guillou had also befriended the former chief of the Swedish military intelligence, who came to serve as a sounding board for the plot of the novels and be the inspiration for the character of the retired spy chief &quot;DG&quot;.

The inspiration for the main character Carl Hamilton was a left wing speaker that Guillou had seen giving a speech during a political manifestation in Stockholm in the late 1960s. This person was named Oxenstierna, an old name from Swedish nobility, and was referred to as &#x27;Comrade Oxenstierna&#x27; during the manifestation, which greatly amused Guillou since he found the idea of a Swedish Count who was also a Socialist to be very entertaining. The reason he changed the name to Hamilton, another old name from the nobility, was because there were so few living people from the family of Oxenstierna and Hamilton was more common and easier to use anonymously.

== Writing style ==
Jan Guillou uses an intended journalistic style for his prose, making the series serve as a contemporary chronicle for Sweden and the end of the Cold War. Each novel in the series has its intended political theme, often depicting the use of un-democratic methods to protect democracy.

Several characters in the books are based on actual people, often slightly disguised. For example, real life Swedish spy Stig Bergling becomes &#x27;Stig Sandström&#x27; and real life intelligence chief Ulf Samuelsson becomes &#x27;Samuel Ulfsson&#x27;. Many real life politicians feature such as Carl Bildt, Yasser Arafat and Mikhail Gorbachev. Jan Guillou himself is the basis of a character named Erik Ponti, which was the alter ego he used in his autobiographical novel &quot;Ondskan&quot; from 1981 (literal translation: &quot;The Evil&quot;).

==The character of Carl Hamilton==

=== Early life ===
As a teenager from the Swedish upperclass in Stockholm, Hamilton was an active member of the intellectual Maoist organisation Clarté and pro-Palestine groups. When entering Sweden&#x27;s compulsory military service as an attack diver for the Navy, his political intent was to infiltrate the system in order to strengthen it against the threat of Soviet imperialism and at the same time reduce the traditionally right wing tendencies of the armed forces. While being trained by the Navy, at 22 years old, he is recruited by the spy chief DG (&quot;The Old One&quot;), with an offer to become a new kind of secret field operator for military intelligence. Instead of attending the Swedish Naval Academy, Hamilton is sent to the US to be secretly trained by the CIA and the Navy SEALs. The cover story for his additional time in the USA was that Hamilton was studying computers at University of California, San Diego. He spent five years in California, completing both college and his secret military and intelligence training in the Mojave Desert. He returned to Sweden in 1981.

A young version of Hamilton also makes brief appearances in the novels &quot;De som dödar drömmar sover aldrig&quot; (2018) and &quot;Den andra dödssynden&quot; (2019) that takes place in the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Career ===
At the beginning of the first novel, &quot;Coq Rouge&quot; (1986), Hamilton has been misplaced to a desk job at the Swedish security service, SÄPO. Because of changed political policies and military union rules, and not least his radical past, his old mentor and recruiter DG has not been able to get him into the military intelligence as was intended. Only after the events in the second novel does he actually get to join the military intelligence, called OP5, after having proved his superior skills in the field. As a secret field operator he is used to gather intelligence, infiltrate, lead rescue operations and commit assassinations. After his cover has been blown in the fourth novel, &quot;Fiendens fiende&quot;, he is often used for political PR purposes and becomes internationally famous, even named Time Person of the Year.

When he first starts making a name for himself in the secret world of spies, during the events of the first novel, he is given the international codename &quot;Coq Rouge&quot;, which has been used as a title of the main series. This codename is ironically derived from a conversation between Näslund, his chief at the Swedish security service, and an Israeli counterpart during a meeting between security officers in France. Näslund, who hates Hamilton, says that Hamilton is as proud as a rooster and a communist. During the conversation, they are drinking wine from a bottle with a red coq on the bottle, and the Israeli officer says: &quot;Why don&#x27;t we call him the red rooster, &quot;Coq Rouge?&quot;. The real codename that Hamilton himself uses with his military colleagues is &quot;Trident&quot;.

Hamilton works for many years in the Swedish military intelligence until he is appointed chief of the Swedish security service in the tenth novel, &quot;En medborgare höjd över varje misstanke&quot; (1995).

Ten years after conclusion of the main series with the tenth novel, Hamilton makes an unexpected return in the novel &quot;Madame Terror&quot; (2006), as the commander of a Palestinian submarine with a mission to destroy the Israeli navy. Guillou had stated in 1995 that the series had ended and could not continue. However, when he was working on &quot;Madame Terror&quot;, he realised that he needed Hamilton to fill in a specific role for the plot to work. After that, Hamilton makes yet another appearance in the novel &quot;Men inte om det gäller din dotter&quot; (2008), where he is again forced to take up arms.

=== Personal traits ===
From his conservative upperclass upbringing, Hamilton has a great interest in wine and classical music. In the first few novels, he lives in an apartment in the Old Town of central Stockholm. Later in the series, he moves to a castle outside Stockholm. As a teenager he was a Communist, while as an adult he considers himself a Socialist.

Before he went to the USA he inherited shares, and when returning this has made him a millionaire on the stock market. Since he has always despised economy built on speculation, he moves his money to funds and property, which to his disliking makes him even richer.

When Hamilton wears his Swedish Naval uniform he wears the insignia of the Navy SEALs, and during the series he is awarded an impressive collection of medals and military decorations.

His preferred weapons are a Beretta 92 (pistol) and a Smith &amp; Wesson Combat Magnum (revolver). He owns a Beretta pistol with a grip in nacre, inscribed with the family weapon of house Hamilton, which he got as a parting gift from his American instructors in California.

He has no fear of darkness, harbouring a well-grounded conviction that because of his superior military training he is the thing to fear in the night. Since a young age he has a particular talent for sharpshooting, which comes to be his personal method for self-meditation. No matter how chaotic his emotional or physical situation, he becomes calm when aiming a gun, &quot;blanking out everything except the line between eye, sight and target&quot;.

Throughout the series, he becomes increasingly tormented and troubled by his work experience, and sometimes visualizes his inner demons as &quot;blocks of black ice surfacing in a raging river&quot;, and routinely suppresses them. In the early books, his mentor DG, who is a trained psychologist as well as a military officer, acts as his sounding board.

=== Medals and decorations ===

== Plot ==

===&quot;Coq Rouge&quot; (1986)===

&quot;Original Swedish title: Coq Rouge: berättelsen om en svensk spion&quot; (literal: &quot;Coq Rouge – the Story of a Swedish Spy&quot;)

In the mid-1980s, a high-ranking officer in the Swedish security service, SÄPO, is found murdered in Stockholm. Together with the policemen of the security service, the young Carl Hamilton is tasked with investigating the murder and soon makes use of his secret military training. The conservative Swedish police put their main focus on Palestinians and left wing radicals, but when the investigation takes Hamilton to Beirut and Israel he finds a different truth.
===&quot;Den demokratiske terroristen&quot; (1987)===

&quot;The Democratic Terrorist&quot;

The West German security service has need of a Swedish colleague to help them infiltrate a remaining group of the Red Army Faction (RAF) that is supposedly planning a terrorist operation in Sweden. Carl Hamilton is the perfect choice with his military training and radical background in the leftist movement.

===&quot;I nationens intresse&quot; (1988)===
&quot;In the Interest of the Nation&quot;

Hamilton has been transferred to the military intelligence he was intended for. His first mission is to escort a defecting Soviet Admiral from Cairo to Sweden, and soon learns that the Soviet Armed Forces has installed secret underwater bases in the Stockholm archipelago. In the shadow of this great threat to the nation, Hamilton is tormented by guilt from a brutal event that his intense military training has caused in his private life.

===&quot;Enemy&#x27;s Enemy&quot; (1989)===
&quot;Original Swedish title: Fiendens fiende.&quot; English translation by Thomas Keeland in 1992.

A Soviet defector in London feeds the Swedish security service information that Hamilton is a double agent working for Russia. Much of this information seems to come from another Swedish double agent, who has recently escaped Swedish prison and is now guarded by the Russians in Moscow. This leads to the disturbing question if the Swedish military intelligence can conduct a secret murder on one of their own citizens.

===&quot;Den hedervärde mördaren&quot; (1990)===
&quot;The Honourable Murderer&quot;

Retired high-ranking Swedish officers are being brutally murdered, and the murderers are leaving traces to a supposed Nazi past. While Sweden is in turmoil from racist movements, Hamilton and his colleagues in the military intelligence are tasked to conduct their own investigation of the murders, searching the military archives and learning the dark past of their predecessors.

===&quot;Vendetta&quot; (1991)===
&quot;Vendetta&quot;

When members of the Swedish arms industry are kidnapped by the Italian mafia in Sicily, Hamilton is tasked to handle the negotiations. He brings one of his closest friends and military colleagues for the mission, and after a deadly first encounter with the mafia, he is thrown into a vicious vendetta where all of his military training is put to use.

===&quot;Ingen mans land&quot; (1992)===
&quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;

Hamilton and the Swedish military intelligence are tasked with preventing stolen nuclear warheads from being smuggled out of Russia, resulting in a secret military operation across the Russian border with a very dark and very disturbing mission.

===&quot;Den enda segern&quot; (1993)===
&quot;The Only Victory&quot;

As a sequel to the previous novel, a second nuclear warhead has been smuggled out through Sweden, revealing that the first deadly attempt was meant only as a sinister distraction. Hamilton, who is tormented by his deeds during that mission, must now work with former enemies in the Russian military intelligence to track the second warhead and the people who stole it, and to prevent a war he must also try to bring the new conservative government in Sweden and the US military into a collaboration with his old friends in the PLO.

=== &quot;I hennes majestäts tjänst&quot; (1994) ===
&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Service&quot;

The British MI5 and MI6 need the assistance of Hamilton and his unit within the Swedish military intelligence to investigate a growing number of mysterious deaths in the British defence industry. Meanwhile, hateful enemies from Hamilton&#x27;s own past are planning a sinister revenge.

===&quot;En medborgare höjd över varje misstanke&quot; (1995)===
&quot;A Citizen Raised Above Every Suspicion&quot;

With his private life in ashes, Hamilton is appointed head of the Swedish security service and begins an effort to reshape the organization. While he is doing a lecture tour of Sweden&#x27;s universities, several immigrant agents of the security service are being murdered with military skill.

===&quot;Hamlon&quot; (novella) (1995)===
After escaping from Sweden, convicted of murder, Hamilton is now living a secret life as a retired rich man in La Jolla, California, with the name Charles Hamlon under the protection of the FBI. When a local murder investigation makes the FBI search for a suspect with elite military skills, Hamlon is taken into consideration.

This novella is written as a draft for an eleventh novel, but the plot was never intended to be solved and it ends with an afterword where Jan Guillou accounts for why the series would not continue. Guillou states that &quot;En medborgare höjd över varje misstanke&quot; was the last book and the conclusion of the series, and in order to make sure that Hamilton would never return he was now &quot;banished&quot; from Sweden through a life sentence and eternal exile in California. Since Guillou only intended to write with clear political themes, based around Sweden, no further books would be possible.

=== &quot;Madame Terror&quot; (2006) ===
Carl Hamilton has spent ten years in secret exile as Charles Hamlon in California, where he is keeping his body in shape and getting psychological help. One day an old friend from the Palestinian intelligence service, Mouna al-Husseini who the world presumed dead, comes to recruit him for a mission. With the help of the Russians, who want revenge on the Americans for sinking the &quot;Kursk&quot; submarine, the Palestinians have developed a high-tech alfa class attack submarine. The crew is mixed Russian and Palestinian, but they have trouble collaborating. They need a strong leader that is neither Russian nor Palestinian, but who can speak Russian, supports the Palestinian cause, has Russian and Palestinian medals, has naval background, understands the strategies of war and is a high-ranking officer. Only one living man fits this description: Carl Hamilton. Their mission is to destroy the entire Israeli fleet.

===&quot;Men inte om det gäller din dotter (2008)&quot;===
&quot;But Not If it Concerns Your Daughter&quot;

After leading the Palestinians to a short-lived victory against Israel, Hamilton is exiled to Russia since the Americans under the George W. Bush regime has declared him an enemy and a terrorist. When he can no longer stay in Russian, after having refused a demand from president Vladimir Putin to become a commander of brutal Russian military operations, he returns to Stockholm in order to have his old murder conviction reconsidered in court. Acquitted, he begins a new retired life in the company of new and old friends, but when a small child is kidnapped by Saudi Arabian terrorists he must once again take up arms and lead another military operation.

The Carl Hamilton who appears in the movies and TV series made between 1989 and 1998 (Stellan Skarsgård, Peter Haber, Stefan Sauk and Peter Stormare) is based on the novels, with minor changes.

The Carl Hamilton who appears in the movies Hamilton – I nationens intresse (2011) and Hamilton – Men inte om det gäller din dotter (2012), played by Mikael Persbrandt, is only loosely based on the character from the novels and does not follow the original story line or setting, and is mostly a new character moved into the 2010s.

The Carl Hamilton who appears in the TV series &quot;Hamilton&quot; (2020), played by Jakob Oftebro, is a younger version moved to the 2020s, with very little resemblance to the original novels.

<text>Quadrics was a supercomputer company formed in 1996 as a joint venture between Alenia Spazio and the technical team from Meiko Scientific. They produced hardware and software for clustering commodity computer systems into massively parallel systems. Their highpoint was in June 2003 when six out of the ten fastest supercomputers in the world were based on Quadrics&#x27; interconnect. They officially closed on June 29, 2009.

==Company history==

The Quadrics name was first used in 1993 for a commercialized version of the APE100 SIMD parallel computer produced by Alenia Spazio and originally developed by INFN, the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics. In 1996, a new Alenia subsidiary, Quadrics Supercomputers World (QSW) was formed, based in Bristol, UK and Rome, Italy, inheriting the Quadrics SIMD product line and the Meiko CS-2 massively parallel supercomputer architecture. In 2002 the company name was shortened to be simply Quadrics.

Initially, the new company focussed on the development potential of the CS-2&#x27;s processor interconnect technology. Their first design was the Elan2 network ASIC, intended for use with the UltraSPARC CPU, attached to it using the Ultra Port Architecture (UPA) system bus. Plans to introduce the Elan2 were later dropped, and a new Elan3 hosted on PCI introduced instead. By the time of its release Elan3 had been re-aimed at the Alpha/PCI market instead, after Quadrics had formed a relationship with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).

The combination of Quadrics and Alpha 21264 (EV6) microprocessors proved very successful, and Digital/Compaq rapidly became one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of supercomputers. This culminated with the building the largest machine in the US, the 20 TFLOP ASCI Q, installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory during 2002 and 2003. The machine consisted of 2,048 AlphaServer SC nodes (which are based on AlphaServer ES45), each with four 1.25 GHz Alpha 21264A (EV67) microprocessors and two rails of the Quadrics QsNet network. Unfortunately this system failed in reliability and was never put into production use.

Quadrics also had success in selling Linux based systems. Quadrics&#x27; first Linux based system was installed in June/July 2001 at SHARCNET. It was the fastest civilian system in Canada at the time of installation. Another high-profile Quadrics system was the fastest Linux cluster in the world called Thunder installed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2003/2004. Thunder consisted of 1024 Intel Tiger Quad Itanium II Processor servers to deliver 19.94 teraflops on parallel Linpack. Peak performance of the system was 22.9 teraflops, at a level of efficiency of 87%.

In 2004, Quadrics was selected by Bull for what was the fastest supercomputer in Europe: TERA-10 at the French CEA: 544 Bull NovaScale 6160 computing nodes, each including eight Itanium 2 processors. The global configuration will feature 8,704 processors with 27 terabytes of core memory. Each of these computing nodes will contain multiple Quadrics QsNetII (Elan4) network adapters to deliver over 60 teraflops (sixty thousands billions of operations per second).

Quadrics was selected by HP for the upgrade of SHARCNET, the Canadian Cluster of Clusters, with four new high-performance computing clusters that would increase the network&#x27;s capacity from 1,000 to 6,000 processors. QsNetII was used for one capacity and one capability cluster.

In August 2005 Quadrics and STMicroelectronics signed a development agreement. The cooperation was to cover the design of a future generations of Quadrics high speed multi gigabit interconnect, and the exploitation of the products in a range of high volume applications. This co-operation never bore fruit despite the secondment of STMicroelectronics Bristol based staff to Quadrics.

The decision to close the company was made in April 2009, despite the next-generation QsNetIII product being very close to completion. Support for older products and the IP rights were transferred to Vega UK Ltd (now Telespazio VEGA ), and the Quadrics offices were closed on June 29, 2009. Many of Quadrics&#x27; technical staff have since found similar employment in developing HPC networking products with Gnodal, one of the many fabless semiconductor companies based in Bristol in the UK.

==Quadrics products==
===Hardware===
* Quadrics QsNetI - HPC interconnect based on the &quot;elan3/elite3&quot; ASICs (350MB/s @ 5us MPI latency)
* Quadrics QsNetII - HPC interconnect based on the &quot;elan4/elite4&quot; ASICs (912MB/s on SR1400 EM64T and 1.26us MPI latency on HP DL145G2)
* QsTenG - 10 Gigabit Ethernet switches, from 24-port (1U) to very large switches.
* QsNet III - HPC interconnect based on the &quot;elan5/elite5&quot; ASICs (approximately 2GB/s each direction and 1.3us MPI latency). This is the first product from Quadrics that is compatible with a standard - in this case 10Gbit Ethernet.

====QsNet====
QsNet was a high speed interconnect designed by Quadrics used in high-performance computing computer clusters, particularly Linux Beowulf clusters. Although it can be used with TCP/IP; like SCI, Myrinet and InfiniBand it is usually used with a communication API such as Message Passing Interface (MPI) or SHMEM called from a parallel program.

The interconnect consists of a PCI card in each compute node and one or more dedicated switch chassis. These are connected with a copper cables. Within the switch chassis are a number of line cards that carry &quot;Elite&quot; switch ASICs. These are internally linked to form a fat tree topology. Like other interconnects such as Myrinet very large systems can be built by using multiple switch chassis arranged as spine (top-level) and leaf (node-level) switches. Such systems were called &quot;federated networks&quot;.

It was announced in 1998 and used PCI 66-64 cards that had &#x27;elan3&#x27; Custom ASIC on them. These gave an MPI bandwidth of around 350MB/s unidirectional with 5us latency.

====QsNet II====
QsNet II was the fourth and penultimate generation of Quadrics interconnect family products, and was launched in 2003. QsNetII interfaced to the host computer through the standard IO PCI-X bus. Later versions of the card had PCIe physical interfaces although this was bridged on the card to PCI-X with a performance penalty. A native PCIe version was never developed. Instead resource was focused on QsNetII&#x27;s successor QsNetIII which although completed was never released commercially.

The architecture of the network interface has been developed to offload the entire task of interprocessor communication from the main processor, and to avoid the overhead of system calls for user process to user process messaging. QsNetII is designed for use within SMP systems — multiple, concurrent processes can utilise the network interface without any task switching overhead. A I/O processor offloads protocol handling from the main CPU. Local memory on the PCI card provides storage for buffers, translation tables and I/O adapter code. All the PCI bandwidth is available to data communication.

QsNetII&#x27;s core design is based on two ASICs: Elan4 and Elite4. Elan4 is a communication processor that forms the interface between a high-performance multistage network and a processing node with one or more CPUs. Elite4 is a switching component that can switch eight bidirectional communications links, each of which carrying data in both directions simultaneously at 1.3GB/s.

Quadrics QsNetII interconnect like its predecessor QsNet uses a &#x27;fat tree&#x27; topology, QsNetII scales up to 4096 nodes, each node might have multiple CPUs so that systems of &gt;10,000 CPUs can be constructed. Multiple, parallel QsNet networks can be employed in a system to maintain the compute to communications ratio where high CPU count SMP nodes are employed. The fat tree topology is resilient with large amounts of redundancy in the higher levels of the switch.

Performance depends on platform used and configuration of the system, QsNetII MPI latency on standard AMD Opteron starts at 1.22μs; Bandwidth on Intel Xeon Intel 64 is 912MB/s.

In 2004, Quadrics started releasing small to medium switch stand-alone switch configurations called QsNetII E-Series, these configurations range from the 8 to the 128-way systems.

====QsTenG====
In November 2005, Quadrics announced a new product based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GigE), called QsTenG. The first QsTenG switch was an 8U chassis with 12 slots for 10 GigE line cards, making 96 ports in total. Each line card had eight 10 GigE ports that connect using 10GBASE-CX4 connectors. Each line card also had four internal ports that connected the line cards together into a fat tree configuration. Since then, Quadrics brought out a second generation of 10 GigE switches, starting with a compact 1U switch with 24 ports, which comes in two variants, TG201-CA, 24 ports CX4, and TG201-XA, 24 ports in total, 12 XSP and 12 CX4. They were expected to bring out a range of larger switches in 2009, the chassis was planned to be the same as the QsNetIII, the switch to have been called TG215.

Late in 2007, the Quadrics management decided to cancel the QsTenG Ethernet developments and concentrate efforts on the QsNet product line. This caused a group employees to leave and help found Gnodal, to develop large scalable Ethernet systems.

===Software===
Software included a cluster resource manager software package called QuadricsRms, and Quadrics Linux Software, core components of the QsNet software release for Linux under the GNU LGPL License

<doc id="259110" wikidata="Q639208" url="?curid=259110" title="Bodiam Castle">
<text>Bodiam Castle () is a 14th-century moated castle near Robertsbridge in East Sussex, England. It was built in 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge, a former knight of Edward III, with the permission of Richard II, ostensibly to defend the area against French invasion during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Of quadrangular plan, Bodiam Castle has no keep, having its various chambers built around the outer defensive walls and inner courts. Its corners and entrance are marked by towers, and topped by crenellations. Its structure, details and situation in an artificial watery landscape indicate that display was an important aspect of the castle&#x27;s design as well as defence. It was the home of the Dalyngrigge family and the centre of the manor of Bodiam.

Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of Dalyngrigges, until their line became extinct when the castle passed by marriage to the Lewknor family. During the Wars of the Roses, Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the House of Lancaster, and when Richard III of the House of York became king in 1483, a force was despatched to besiege Bodiam Castle. It is unrecorded whether the siege went ahead, but it is thought that Bodiam surrendered without much resistance. The castle was confiscated, but returned to the Lewknors when Henry VII of the House of Tudor became king in 1485. Descendants of the Lewknors owned the castle until at least the 16th century.

By the start of the English Civil War in 1641, Bodiam Castle was in the possession of John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet. He supported the Royalist cause, and sold the castle to help pay fines levied against him by Parliament. The castle was subsequently dismantled, and was left as a picturesque ruin until its purchase by John Fuller in 1829. Under his auspices, the castle was partially restored before being sold to George Cubitt, 1st Baron Ashcombe, and later to Lord Curzon, both of whom undertook further restoration work. The castle is protected as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Monument. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1925, donated by Lord Curzon on his death, and is open to the public.

==Background==

Edward Dalyngrigge was a younger son and thus deprived of his father&#x27;s estates through the practice of primogeniture, hence he had to make his own fortunes. By 1378, he owned the manor of Bodiam by marrying into a land-owning family. From 1379 to 1388, Dalyngrigge was a Knight of the Shire for Sussex and one of the most influential people in the county. By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate (build a castle), the Hundred Years&#x27; War had been fought between England and France for nearly 50 years. Edward III of England (reigned 1327–1377) pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of Aquitaine and Calais. Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of Free Companies – groups of mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder. He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with Lionel, Duke of Clarence, son of Edward III. After fighting under Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel, Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir Robert Knolles, a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100,000 gold crowns as a mercenary from pillage and plunder. It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle; he returned to England in 1377.

The Treaty of Bruges (1375) ensured peace for two years, but after it expired, fighting resumed between England and France. In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II. During the war, England and France struggled for control of the English Channel, with raids on both coasts. With the renewed hostilities, Parliament voted that money should be spent on defending and fortifying England&#x27;s south coast, and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion. There was internal unrest as well as external threats, and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held. In 1385, a fleet of 1,200 ships – variously cogs, barges, and galleys – gathered across the English Channel at Sluys, Flanders; the population of southern England was in a state of panic. Later in the year, Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house.

=== Occupants of Bodiam Castle ===

==== 14th Century ====

* 1385: Sir Edward Dalyngrigge constructed Bodiam Castle. It remained in the hands of his descendants for decades, including John Dalyngrigge, Alice Dalyngrigge, and Richard Dallingrigge.
* 1395: John Dalyngrigge inherited the castle following the death of his father, Sir Edward Dalyngrigge.

* 1442: Richard Dallingrigge became the owner of Bodiam Castle after Alice’s death.
* 1470: Sir Thomas Lewknor inherited the castle through his marriage to Phillipee Dallingridge.
* 1483: During the Wars of the Roses, King Richard III besieged Bodiam Castle after Thomas Lewknor opposed him. However, the castle was restored to the Lewknor family two years later, where it remained until the late 16th century.

==== 16th Century ====

* 1588: John Levett of Salehurst acquired Bodiam Castle, but financial difficulties later forced him to sell his estates.

* 1916: Lord Curzon bought Bodiam Castle and undertook restoration efforts to preserve its historical significance.

==Construction and use==
Dalyngrigge&#x27;s licence from Richard II permitted him to refortify his existing manor house, but instead he chose a fresh site to build a castle on. Construction was completed in one phase, and most of the castle is in the same architectural style. Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, probably because of the threat from the French. Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds. Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for the first years of the castle&#x27;s construction. It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge&#x27;s main residence and the administrative centre of the manor. It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle, as he was dead by 1395.

Danlyngrigge&#x27;s estates, including the castle, were inherited by his son, John Dalyngrigge. Like his father, John enjoyed the favour of the King and was described as the &quot;King&#x27;s Knight&quot;; in 1400 he was granted an annual allowance of 100 marks by the King. He died on 27 September 1408, leaving a will by which his property passed to his widow Alice during her lifetime. Since they had no children, at Alice&#x27;s death (which occurred in 1442) it was to pass to John&#x27;s cousin Richard Dallingrigge, son of Edward&#x27;s brother Walter. Upon Richard&#x27;s death without issue in 1470, his brother William having died before him, he left the estates to Sir Roger Lewknor, son of Richard&#x27;s sister Phillippe Dallingridge. (Phillippe had married Sir Thomas Lewknor of Horsted Keynes before 1417, and died in 1421; Sir Thomas, who made a second marriage, died in 1452.) By this means, Bodiam Castle passed from the Dallingrigge into the Lewknor family.

Sir Thomas Lewknor, son of Sir Roger, was a supporter of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455. When Richard of the House of York ascended to the throne as Richard III in 1483, Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising men-at-arms in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor&#x27;s uncle and Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead, and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance. His property was confiscated, and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the castle. On Henry VII&#x27;s accession to the English throne the attainder was revoked, and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor. However, not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542. Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family. Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries, there is little to indicate how it was used in this period, or if the family spent much time in it.

Following the death of Sir Roger Lewknor in 1543, his estates were divided among his descendants, and the castle and manor were split. John Levett of Salehurst purchased the castle in 1588. In 1623, most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir Nicholas Tufton, later Earl of Thanet. His son, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet, inherited Nicholas&#x27;s property on his father&#x27;s death in 1631; it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639. John Tufton was a supporter of the Royalist cause during the English Civil War, and led an attack on Lewes, and was involved in a Royalist defeat at Haywards Heath. Parliament confiscated some of his lands in 1643, and more in 1644, as well as fining him £9,000 (£ today). To help pay his fine, Tufton sold Bodiam Castle for £6,000 (£ today) in March 1644 to Nathaniel Powell, a Parliamentarian.

==Picturesque ruins==

After the Civil War, Powell was made a baronet by Charles II. Although it is unrecorded when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted to prevent them from being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.

In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster bought the castle. For over a century, Bodiam Castle and its associated manor descended through the Webster family. It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy. Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures.

Sir Godfrey Webster, 5th Baronet began looking for buyers for the castle in 1815, and in 1829 he finally managed to sell it and of the surrounding land to John &#x27;Mad Jack&#x27; Fuller for £3,000 (£ today). Fuller repaired one of the towers, added new gates to the site, and removed a cottage which had been built within the castle in the 18th century; he is thought to have bought the castle to prevent the Webster family from dismantling it and reusing its materials. George Cubitt, later Baron Ashcombe, purchased the castle and its from Fuller&#x27;s grandson in 1849, for over £5,000 (£ today). Cubitt continued the renovations that Fuller started. He commissioned the first detailed survey of Bodiam Castle in 1864, and undertook repairs to the tower at the southwest corner of the site, which had almost entirely collapsed. Because there was then a fashion for ruins covered in ivy, the vegetation was not removed despite its detrimental effect on the masonry, and the trees which had taken root in the courtyard were left.

Lord Curzon decided that &quot;so rare a treasure [as Bodiam Castle] should neither be lost to our country nor desecrated by irreverent hands&quot;. Curzon made enquiries about buying the castle, but Cubitt did not wish to sell. However, after Cubitt&#x27;s death, Curzon was able to make a deal with Cubitt&#x27;s son, and he bought Bodiam Castle and its lands in 1916. Curzon began a programme of investigation at Bodiam in 1919, and with architect William Weir restored parts of the castle. The moat, on average about deep but deep in the southeast corner, was drained and of mud and silt removed; during excavations the original footings of the bridges to the castle were discovered. Nearby hedges and fences were removed to provide an unobscured view of the castle. There were excavations in the interior, and a well was discovered in the basement of the southwest tower. Vegetation was cleared, stonework repaired, and the original floor level re-established throughout the castle. A cottage was built to provide a museum to display the finds from the excavations and a home for a caretaker. Bodiam Castle was given to the National Trust in 1925.

The National Trust continued the restoration work, and added new roofs to the towers and gatehouse. Excavations were resumed in 1970, and the moat was once again drained. Bodiam Castle was used in &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975) in an establishing shot identifying it as &quot;Swamp Castle&quot; in the &quot;Tale of Sir Lancelot&quot; sequence. It had previously been used for the filming of &quot;Camelot&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Goodies&quot; broadcast in 1973. It was later the filming location for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The King&#x27;s Demons&quot;, broadcast in 1983, and was used again in the revived series for the 2014 episode &quot;Robot of Sherwood&quot;.

The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England carried out a survey of the earthworks surrounding Bodiam Castle in 1990. In the 1990s, Bodiam Castle was at the centre of a debate in castle studies over the balance between militaristic and social interpretations of such sites. The arguments focused on elements such as the apparent strength of the defences – such as the imposing moat  – and elements of display. It has been suggested that the moat could have been drained in a day because the embankment surrounding it was not substantial, and that as such it did not pose a serious obstacle to an attacker. Also, the large windows in the castle&#x27;s exterior were defensive weak points. The castle is a Scheduled Monument, which means it is a &quot;nationally important&quot; historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade I listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. Today the castle is open to the public, and according to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, nearly 175,598 people visited in 2017. In the opinion of historian Charles Coulson, Bodiam &quot;represents the popular ideal of a medieval castle&quot;.

==Architecture==

===Location and landscape===

The castle&#x27;s location was ostensibly chosen to protect England&#x27;s south coast from raids by the French. A landscape survey by the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments concluded that if this were the case, then Bodiam Castle was unusually sited, as it is far from the medieval coastline.

The area surrounding Bodiam Castle was landscaped when the castle was built, to increase its aesthetic appeal. Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam as one of the best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle. The water features were originally extensive, but only the moat survives, along with the earthworks left over from its construction. Roughly rectangular, the moat is supplied by several springs, some of them within it, which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s. A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle&#x27;s walls, but in the case of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape. The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence. The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect, giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour. Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable, and considers it the equal of the 13th-century castles of Edward I in Wales, such as Caerphilly Castle.

The castle sits roughly in the middle of the moat. The postern gate at the rear would have been connected to the moat&#x27;s south bank by a drawbridge and a long timber bridge. The main entrance on the north side of the castle is today connected to the north bank by a wooden bridge, but the original route would have included two bridges: one from the main entrance to an island in the moat, and another connecting the island to the west bank. For the most part the bridge was static, apart from the section closest to the west bank, which would have been a drawbridge. The island in the moat is called the Octagon, and excavations on it have uncovered a garderobe (toilet), suggesting that there may have been a guard on the island, although it is unclear to what extent it was fortified. The Octagon was connected to a barbican by a bridge, probably a drawbridge. The castle&#x27;s 28 toilets drained directly into the moat, which in the words of archaeologist Matthew Johnson would have been effectively an &quot;open sewer&quot;.

===Exterior and entrance===

A quadrangular castle, Bodiam is roughly square-shaped. This type of castle, with a central courtyard and buildings against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle has been described by military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower in the middle of the south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.

Between the Octagon and the main gatehouse in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives – just a piece of the west wall – although the structure was originally two stories high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican&#x27;s north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that the second story would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.

The gatehouse in the castle&#x27;s north wall is three storeys high; now reached by a static bridge, it was originally connected to the barbican by a drawbridge. The top of the gatehouse is machicolated, and the approach is overlooked by gun-loops in the gatehouse towers. The gatehouse is the only part of the castle which has gun-loops, and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military. There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them. The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises. Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway, although it leads nowhere. The ceiling of the passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and pierced with murder holes. Murder holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations, or to pour water to extinguish fires.

Just above the gate, there are three coats of arms carved in relief into the arch; from left to right they are the arms of the Wardeux, Dalyngrigge, and Radynden families. The Wardeux shield was for his wife Elizabeth, and the Radynden shield was for his mother Alice (one of the three daughters of John de Radynden). Above the arms is a helm bearing a unicorn head crest. Three coats of arms also decorate the postern gate; the central arms is that of Sir Robert Knolles, who Edward Dalyngrigge had fought for in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, but those flanking it are blank.

===Interior===

Although the exterior of Bodiam Castle has largely survived, the interior is ruinous. The domestic buildings within the castle lined the curtain walls. However, remains are substantial enough to recreate a plan of the castle. The structure was divided into separate living areas for the lord and his family, high-status guests, the garrisons, and servants. The south range of the castle consisted of the great hall, the kitchens, and associated rooms. The great hall, to the east of the centrally located postern gate, was and would have been as tall as the curtain wall. To the west of the great hall was the pantry and buttery, linked to the great hall by a screens passage. The three standing arches gave access to different rooms, the pantry, buttery and the kitchen which was at the far west of the south range. This layout was typical of large medieval houses. The great hall was the social centre of the castle, and where the lord would have entertained guests. The buttery and pantry occupied the bottom floor, and above was a room of unknown purpose. The buttery had a cellar and was used to store ale and wine, while the pantry held the supplies for the kitchen. To prevent heat from the cooking fires becoming unbearable, the kitchen was as tall as the curtain walls to provide a large space to absorb the heat. In the southwest tower was a well, from which water would have been drawn for the household.

Along the east wall is a chapel, a hall, and an antechamber. To accommodate the chapel, the curtain wall near the northeast corner projects further into the moat than the rest of the wall along the east side. Immediately south of the chapel was the main accommodation for the lord and his family. The buildings were two storeys high and incorporated a basement. The exact layout of the rooms is unclear.

Arranged along the west curtain wall was an extra hall and a kitchen; it is not certain what these were used for, although it is probable that these were intended to provide for the household&#x27;s retainers. The &quot;retainers&#x27; hall&quot; had no windows on its west side and would have been relatively dark compared to the great hall. Also, whereas the great hall had a large fireplace, the &quot;retainers&#x27; hall&quot; had none. The hall was adjacent to the kitchen, to which it was directly connected, with no screens passage in between. Above the &quot;retainers&#x27; hall&quot;, which was confined to the ground floor, was a room with no fireplace and of unclear purpose.

East of the main gatehouse was a two-storey building with a basement. The basement was likely used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation. The purpose of the buildings along the west end of the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was a basement underneath.

<text>Terrorism insurance is insurance purchased by property owners to cover their potential losses and liabilities that might occur due to terrorist activities.

It is considered to be a difficult product for insurance companies, as the odds of terrorist attacks are very difficult to predict and the potential liability enormous. For example, the September 11, 2001 attacks resulted in an estimated $31.7 billion loss. This combination of uncertainty and potentially huge losses makes the setting of premiums a difficult matter. Most insurance companies therefore exclude terrorism from coverage in casualty and property insurance, or else require endorsements to provide coverage.

==Industry needs==
Concentration of risk is another factor in determining availability for terrorism insurance. Due to the concentrated losses of the World Trade Center, carriers were hit with large losses in one centralized location. Insurers seek to spread the coverage over a wider geographic area than as with other aggregate perils, such as flood.

==Modelling the risks==

Insurance companies are using an approach that is similar to that used with natural catastrophe risks. A Swiss report suggested that in this case where demand is greater than the supply for terrorism coverage that a short-term solution is possible: a mix of government and private resource to make easy the transition. In this situation, the government would serve two functions: to establish rules to overcome the capacity shortage and to be the insurer of last resort.

==By country==
===France===
In France, a pool of insurers and reinsurers was set up on 1 January 2002 under the name Gestion de l&#x27;Assurance et de la RÉassurance des risques attentats et Actes de Terrorisme (GAREAT). GAREAT is constituted upon the principle of mutuality between its Members, all of whom are jointly liable, and relies on the support given to GAREAT by international reinsurers as well as by the French State which provides unlimited coverage to the GAREAT programme via unlimited treaties reinsured 100% by . As a non-profit-making Economic Interest Grouping mandated by its Members, GAREAT returns to the latter that part of the premiums which are not used to finance the reinsurance coverage at the close of each year.

=== Germany ===
The Extremus Versicherung, founded in 2002, is a private company that insures terrorism risks in Germany. While the first 2.5 billion € in damages are covered by the insurance, the German government guarantees a further 6.5 billion € in insurance pay-outs.

===Netherlands===
Insurance payments related to terrorism are restricted to a billion euro per year for all insurance companies together. This regards property insurance, but also life insurance, medical insurance, etc.

===Iraq===
The New York Times reports that in Baghdad personal terrorism insurance is available. One company offers such insurance for $90, and if the customer is a victim of terrorism in the next year, it pays the heirs $3,500.

===United States===

In 2002, the US Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, in which the government shared the cost of large insurance losses.

On December 26, 2007, the President of the United States signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 which extends the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) through December 31, 2014. The law extends the temporary federal Program that provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism.

Some economists have supported U.S. government subsidies of terrorism insurance. Soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, economist Edwin Mills expressed concern over whether private developers could build real estate without subsidies for insurance. Economist David R. Barker argued that properly structured subsidies could increase overall economic efficiency. Other economists have argued against these subsidies.

The United States insurance market offers coverage to the majority of large companies which ask for it in their policies. The price of the policy depends on where the clients are residing and how much limit they buy.
According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, one of the best studies to understand TRIA has been the one undertaken in 2005 by the Center for Risk Management at the Wharton Business School (&quot;TRIA and Beyond&quot;; available on their website below).

In mid-2007 the idea of another extension to TRIA was tabled and is officially known as TRIREA, (Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act). Initially TRIREA contained several new provisions including a mandatory &#x27;make available&#x27; clause for NCBR coverage (Nuclear, Chemical, Biological and Radiological) and the ending of the distinction between domestic and foreign events.

The act expired on December 31, 2014, but was renewed at the start of the next congress, with Obama signing the extension of the TIRA through 2020 on January 12, 2015. Up until the 2014 expiration, many experts warned that &quot;construction projects could be stalled and commercial loans on shopping malls, utilities and skyscrapers could be in jeopardy.&quot; In addition, according to the Baltimore Sun, the National Football League denied rumors that it would cancel the Super Bowl over the issue.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, following the Baltic Exchange bomb in 1992, all UK insurers stopped including terrorism coverage on their commercial insurance policies with effect from 1 January 1993 (home insurance policies were unaffected). As a consequence, the government and insurance industry established the Pool Reinsurance Company Ltd (Pool Re). Primarily funded by premiums paid by policyholders, the government guarantees the fund although any such support must be repaid from future premiums. To date, despite paying over £600 million in relation to thirteen separate claims, no government support has been necessary.

<text>George Maniakes (; ; died 1043) was a prominent general of the Byzantine Empire during the 11th century. He was the catepan of Italy in 1042. He is known as Gyrgir in Scandinavian sagas. He is popularly said to have been extremely tall and well built, almost a giant.

==Biography==
Maniakes was a Greek general of the Byzantine Empire, who first came to prominence during a campaign in 1030–1031 when the Byzantine army was defeated at Aleppo, but went on to capture Edessa from the Arabs. His greatest achievement was the partial reconquest of Sicily from the Arabs beginning in 1038. 
He was aided by the Varangian Guard, then led by Harald Hardrada, who later became King of Norway. Also with him were Norman mercenaries under William de Hauteville, who earned his nickname &quot;Iron Arm&quot; by defeating the Emir of Syracuse in single combat. However, he soon ostracized his admiral, Stephen, whose wife was the sister of John the Eunuch, the highest-ranking man at court. He then publicly humiliated Arduin, the leader of the Lombard contingent, causing them to desert along with the Normans and Norsemen. In response, he was recalled by Emperor Michael IV, who was also Stephen&#x27;s brother-in-law. Although the Arabs soon recaptured the island, Maniakes&#x27; successes there later inspired the Normans to invade Sicily themselves.

Maniakes&#x27; achievements in Sicily were largely ignored by the emperor, and he revolted against Constantine IX in 1042, despite having been appointed catepan of Italy. The person most responsible for inciting Maniakes to revolt was one Romanus Sclerus. Sclerus, like Maniakes, was one of the immensely wealthy landowners who owned large areas of Anatolia - his estates bordered Maniakes&#x27;, and the two were rumored to have attacked each other in a dispute over land. Sclerus owed his influence with the emperor to his famously charming sister, Maria Skleraina, who had a very positive influence on Constantine in most areas. Finding himself in a position of power, Sclerus used it to poison Constantine against Maniakes - ransacking his house and even seducing his wife, using the charm for which his family was famous. Maniakes&#x27; response to Sclerus&#x27; demand that he surrender command of the Empire&#x27;s forces in Apulia was to torture him brutally; sealing his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth with excrement. Maniakes was then proclaimed emperor by his troops (including the Varangians) and marched on Constantinople. In 1043 his army clashed with troops loyal to Constantine near Thessalonica, and although initially successful, Maniakes was killed in the melee after receiving a fatal wound (according to Psellus&#x27; account). Constantine&#x27;s extravagant punishment of the surviving rebels was to parade them in the hippodrome, sitting backwards on donkeys. His death put an end to the rebellion. In Sicily, the town of Maniace and the Syracusan fortress Castello Maniace are named after him.

==In popular culture==
In the historical drama series &quot;&quot;, George Maniakes is played by actor Florian Munteanu. His portrayal in the series is highly fictionalized, with major deviations from historicity. As an example, George Maniakes rebelled against Emperor Constantine IX, not Emperor Romanos as depicted in the series.

<text>Cost-plus pricing is a pricing strategy by which the selling price of a product is determined by adding a specific fixed percentage (a &quot;markup&quot;) to the product&#x27;s unit cost. Essentially, the markup percentage is a method of generating a particular desired rate of return. An alternative pricing method is value-based pricing. 

Cost-plus pricing has often been used for government contracts (cost-plus contracts), and has been criticized for reducing incentive for suppliers to control direct costs, indirect costs and fixed costs whether related to the production and sale of the product or service or not. 

Companies using this strategy need to record their costs in detail to ensure they have a comprehensive understanding of their overall costs. This information is necessary to generate accurate cost estimates.

Cost-plus pricing is especially common for utilities and single-buyer products that are manufactured to the buyer&#x27;s specification, such as for military procurement.

==Mechanics==
The three stages of computing the selling price are computing the total cost, computing the unit cost, and then adding a markup to generate a selling price (refer to Fig 1). 
Step 1: Calculating total cost

&quot;Total cost = fixed costs + variable costs&quot; 

Fixed costs do not generally depend on the number of units, while variable costs do. 

Step 2: Calculating unit cost

&quot;Unit cost = (total cost/number of units)&quot; 

Step 3a: Calculating markup price

&quot;Markup price = (unit cost * markup percentage)&quot; 

The markup is a percentage that is expected to provide an acceptable rate of return to the manufacturer.

Step 3b: Calculating Selling Price (SP)

&quot;Selling Price = unit cost + markup price&quot;

== Example ==
A shop selling a vacuum cleaner will be examined since retail stores generally adopt this strategy. 

Total cost = $450

Markup percentage = 12%

&quot;Markup price = (unit cost * markup percentage)&quot; 

Markup price = $450 * 0.12

Markup price = $54

&quot;Sales Price = unit cost + markup price&quot; 

Sales Price= $450 + $54

Sales Price = $504

Ultimately, the $54 markup price is the shop&#x27;s margin of profit.

Cost-plus pricing is common and there are many examples where the margin is transparent to buyers. Costco reportedly created rules to limit product markups to 15% with an average markup of 11% across all products sold. In another example, at the bottom of each product page, Everlane breaks down the manufacturing cost into five categories: materials, hardware, labor, duties, and transport.

== Rationale ==

Buyers may perceive that cost-plus pricing is reasonable. In some cases, the markup is mutually agreed upon by buyer and seller. For markets that feature relatively similar production costs, companies do not have a dominant strategy. Therefore, cost-plus pricing can offer competitive stability, decreasing the risk of price competition (such as price wars), if all companies adopt cost-plus pricing. The strategy enables price changes to goods and services relative to increases or decreases in the product cost which are simple to communicate and justify to customers. When there is little market intelligence, the use of a cost-plus pricing strategy compensates for the lack of information by setting prices based on actual costs. This method is generally adopted by retail companies such as grocery or clothing stores.

Cost-based pricing is a way to induce a seller to accept a contract the costs of which represent a large fraction of the seller&#x27;s revenues, or for which costs are uncertain at contract signing, as for example for research and development.

==Economic theory==

Cost-plus pricing is not common in markets that are (nearly) perfectly competitive, for which prices and output are such that marginal cost (the cost of producing an additional unit) equals marginal revenue. In the long run, marginal and average costs (as for cost-plus) tend to converge, reducing the difference between the two strategies. It works well when a business is in need of short-term finance.

==Elasticity considerations==
Although this method of pricing has limited application as mentioned above, it is used commonly for the purpose of ensuring a business covers its costs by &quot;breaking even&quot; and not operating at a loss whilst generating at least a minimum rate of profit. In spite of its ubiquity, economists rightly point out that it has serious flaws. Specifically, the strategy requires little market research hence it does not account for external factors such as consumer demand and competitor&#x27;s prices when determining an appropriate selling price. There is no way in advance of determining if potential customers will purchase the product at the calculated price. Regardless of which pricing strategy a company chooses, price elasticity (sensitivity of demand to price) is a vital component to examine. To compensate for this, some economists have tried to apply the principles of price elasticity to cost-plus pricing.

We know that:MR = P + ((dP / dQ) * Q)
where: 
MR = marginal revenue&lt;BR&gt;
P = price
(dP / dQ) = the derivative of price with respect to quantity&lt;BR&gt;
Q = quantity

Since we know that a profit maximizer sets quantity at the point that marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost (MR = MC), the formula can be written as:MC = P + ((dP / dQ) * Q)

Dividing by P and rearranging yields:MC / P = 1 +((dP / dQ) * (Q / P))

And since (P / MC) is a form of markup, we can calculate the appropriate markup for any given market elasticity by:(P / MC) = (1 / (1 – (1/E))) where:(P / MC) = markup on marginal costs&lt;BR&gt;E = price elasticity of demand

In the extreme case where elasticity is infinite:(P / MC) = (1 / (1 – (1/999999999999999)))&lt;BR&gt; (P / MC) = (1 / 1)Price is equal to marginal cost. There is no markup.

At the other extreme, where elasticity is equal to unity:(P /MC) = (1 / (1 – (1/1)))&lt;BR&gt; (P / MC) = (1 / 0) The markup is infinite. 

Most business people do not do marginal cost calculations, but one can arrive at the same conclusion using average variable costs (AVC): (P / AVC) = (1 / (1 – (1/E))) Technically, AVC is a valid substitute for MC only in situations of constant returns to scale (LVC = LAC = LMC).

When business people choose the markup that they apply to costs when doing cost-plus pricing, they should be, and often are, considering the price elasticity of demand, whether consciously or not.

<text>CityRail was a passenger railway brand operated by the State Rail Authority from 1989 to 2003 and by RailCorp from 2003 to 2013 with services in and around Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, the three largest cities in New South Wales, Australia. It was established in January 1989 and abolished in June 2013 when it was superseded by Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink.
In June 2013, it operated 307 stations and over 2,060 kilometres of track, extending north to the upper Hunter Valley, south to the Shoalhaven and Southern Highlands regions and west to Bathurst. In the year ended 30 June 2012, 306 million journeys were made on the network.

==History==
===Structure===

CityRail was established pursuant to the , and was first mentioned as an entity distinct from the State Rail Authority in the Parliament of New South Wales by then governor James Rowland on 21 February 1990. CityRail adopted a blue and yellow version of the State Rail Authority &quot;L7&quot; logo, to fit into its new blue and yellow colour scheme. This logo continued to be in use until 2010, when it was replaced by the Waratah logo of the NSW Government.

On 1 January 2004, RailCorp assumed all functions of the State Rail Authority, and later the functions of the Rail Infrastructure Corporation and Rail Access Corporation. This resulted in CityRail becoming a subsidiary of RailCorp, along with CountryLink. CityRail became defunct on 1 July 2013, with Sydney Trains taking over suburban services and NSW TrainLink taking over Intercity and regional services.

===Operational history===
When the CityRail brand was introduced the State Rail Authority was part way through taking delivery of 450 Tangara carriages. With these new carriages in service, the last single deck suburban sets were withdrawn in 1992, and the last U set interurban sets were withdrawn in 1996.

In February 1994, the first of 15 two-carriage Endeavour railcars was delivered. These replaced Class 620/720 railcars, Class 900 railcars and locomotive-hauled stock.

In February 1995, CityRail ceased the operations of the Punchbowl Maintenance Depot for the storage of double-decker electric trains.

In May 2000, the Airport railway line opened to CityRail services. In July 2002, the first of 141 M set carriages entered service. In November 2006, the first of seven two-carriage Hunter railcar trains entered service.

In December 2006, the first of 221 Oscar carriages entered service on the South Coast Line. In February 2009, the Epping to Chatswood railway line opened with shuttle services and was integrated into the Northern Line service later that year.

In July 2011, the first Waratah trains entered service to replace the S sets, although it was announced in 2013 that some S sets would stay. In October 2012, a new service from Bathurst to Sydney commenced.

==Operations==

===Fleet===
At the time of its cessation in June 2013, CityRail operated eight electric multiple unit classes for suburban and interurban working and two diesel multiple unit classes. All CityRail electric trains used 1500 V DC overhead electrification and travel on 1,435mm standard gauge tracks. Double deck rollingstock was first introduced in 1964 and after 1996, all electric multiple units were double deck.
=== Former fleet ===
The following table consists of trains that were in the CityRail fleet which were withdrawn prior to CityRail&#x27;s demise:

The CityRail network was divided into three sectors, based around three maintenance depots. EMU trainsets were identified by target plates, which are exhibited on the front lower nearside of driving carriages. Target designations and set numbers were used in identifying EMU trainsets. The composition and formations of trainsets, and the target designations were subject to alteration.

All V sets which operated on the Newcastle and Blue Mountains lines, were serviced at Flemington Depot. All M and H sets, which had a green target plate, were serviced at Eveleigh Maintenance Centre.

===Ticketing===
For most of the brand&#x27;s life CityRail&#x27;s ticketing system was the Automated Fare Collection System (AFC). Dating from 1992, it was based on magnetic stripe technology and was interoperable with the Sydney Buses and Sydney Ferries systems. In later years the network was incorporated into the MyZone ticketing system, which retained the AFC technology but extended the validity of multi-modal tickets to private buses and light rail.

Unlike the ticketing systems of other cities in Australia, most of CityRail&#x27;s ticket prices were calculated on the distance travelled, and were proven to be the most expensive tickets of any major city public transport system.

===Performance===
According to the 2003 &quot;Parry Report&quot;, &quot;The interaction of metropolitan, suburban, intercity and freight lines and services has resulted in an overly complex system. This complexity has contributed in part to the organisation being widely criticised for poor reliability and safety. CityRail was also enormously expensive.&quot;

On-time running improved after new timetables were introduced in 2005 and 2006. The newly introduced timetable increased station dwell and journey times.

In October 2012, a report published by PricewaterhouseCoopers found CityRail performed poorly compared to many metro services from 27 other major world cities. Sydney was ranked as the fourth-worst public train system while being proven to have the most expensive tickets of any major city public transport system.

===Patronage===
The following table lists patronage figures for the network during the corresponding financial year. Australia&#x27;s financial years start on 1 July and end on 30 June. Expansions and contractions of the network and major events that affected the number of journeys made are included as notes.

==Network==
CityRail operated eleven suburban lines, four intercity services, one regional service, and five connecting bus services, plus a late night bus service across metropolitan Sydney.

===Suburban lines===


===Intercity lines===

: Some peak services on the Blue Mountains Line ran to/from Hornsby
: Some peak services and most weekend services on the South Coast Line ran to/from Bondi Junction
: Some peak services on the Southern Highlands Line to/from Central. At other times, a change of train was required at Campbelltown or Macarthur
===Regional line===
===Connecting bus services===
CityRail operated several bus routes along corridors where the railway line has been closed to passengers or as a supplement to rail services. These bus services appeared in CityRail timetables and accepted CityRail tickets, but were operated by private sector bus companies contracted by CityRail. Two were CountryLink services that carried CityRail passengers.
: CountryLink services, seat reservations required
===NightRide===

To provide a passenger service between midnight and 05:00 while leaving the tracks clear of trains for maintenance work, parallel bus services were established in 1989. NightRide services operated typically at hourly intervals (some routes depart more frequently on weekends). NightRide services were run by private bus operators, and identified by route numbers beginning with &quot;N&quot;. All valid CityRail tickets for a destination (apart from single tickets) were accepted on NightRide services.

===Network overview===
Most Intercity trains terminated at Central while most suburban (except Carlingford Line) services proceeded through the city.

CityRail also operated several Intercity services that terminate at Central station (though some services operated in the metro-style portions of the system in the peak hours). These lines stretched over 200 kilometres from Sydney, as far north as Newcastle, as far west as Bathurst, as far south-west as Goulburn and as far south as Kiama and Port Kembla. Southern Highlands trains required a connection at Campbelltown as they ran into the city during peak hours only.

Regional services operated from the terminus station at Newcastle, with local electric services to the Central Coast and diesel services to Telarah with some extending to Dungog and Scone. Diesel services also operated on the South Coast Line between Kiama and Bomaderry.

The hub of the CityRail system was Central station, where most lines started and ended. Trains coming from the Airport &amp; East Hills Line and Bankstown Line, after travelling anti-clockwise on the City Circle, sometimes terminated upon arrival at Central and proceeded to the Macdonaldtown turnback. However, most trains continued on and become outward bound Inner West Line and South Line services. The reverse applied for trains coming from the Inner West and South lines, which, if not terminating, became outward bound trains on the Airport &amp; East Hills and Bankstown lines respectively. In the same manner, all trains from the Western Line and Northern Line became North Shore Line trains once they reached Central.

As well as the Intercity services mentioned above, local services also ran in the Newcastle local area during off-peak times, as part of the Newcastle &amp; Central Coast Line. Local services also ran on the South Coast Line in the Wollongong local area, usually between Thirroul and Port Kembla.

===Passenger information systems===

Many CityRail stations were equipped with electronic passenger destination indicator boards. These provided information on the current time, next three available services, time due to arrival, destination route and the number of train carriages available.

Due to the many differing types of stations that CityRail serves, their screens varied in form. In station where trains arrived at a higher frequency, 2 or more vertical LED screens were used on each platform to display the destination and arrival time whereas in low frequency areas 1 or 2 dual horizontal LED screens with a larger font were used. Manual destination indicator boards were still used at some lower patronage stations. In regional areas, a station relied on digital voice announcement for information on services. CBSM (Custom Built Sheet Metal) was responsible for the manufacture of many indicator board encasings.

==Challenges==
The quality of the rail system was a matter of considerable political sensitivity. The performance of the State Rail Authority and RailCorp were questioned in regards to safety, training, a politically motivated focus on punctuality, management and workplace culture, with strong criticism from Justice Peter McInerny in his inquiries into the accidents at Glenbrook and Waterfall. Transport is the third largest area of public expenditure in NSW, after health and education. A newspaper distributed to commuters, &quot;mX&quot;, and the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&#x27;s&quot; &quot;campaign for Sydney&quot; kept transport at the top of the agenda ahead of the 2007 state election. In his 2003 interim report to the NSW Government, Tom Parry was highly critical of CityRail. &quot;It is hard to believe that taxpayers or the state are getting the best possible value from the large amounts of money being spent each year,&quot; he wrote.

===Safety===

The safety of the CityRail network was called into question by two fatal accidents. The second Glenbrook train disaster in 1999 killed seven people. In 2003, the Waterfall train disaster killed seven. Inquiries were conducted into both accidents. Official findings into the latter accident also blamed an &quot;underdeveloped safety culture.&quot; There has been criticism of the way CityRail managed safety issues that arose, resulting in what the NSW Ministry of Transport called &quot;a reactive approach to risk management.&quot;

CityRail has launched public information campaigns regarding railway trespassing, prams and strollers, and falling between the platform and the train.

===Crime and terrorism===

Crime committed on railway property has decreased by 32.9% since 2002, which RailCorp attributes to the deployment of some 600 Transit Officers across the network. All stations, including those that are remote or unstaffed, have emergency &quot;help points&quot; to put passengers in immediate contact with authorities should an incident occur. All stations are covered by closed-circuit television surveillance. However, a large amount of graffiti is still evident on some trains and the depots.

In recent years, concerns over terrorism have played a role in the management of the network. CityRail and other public transport providers participate in an ongoing public terrorism awareness campaign, &quot;If you see something, say something&quot;, adapted from a similar campaign in New York.

===Overloading===
In 2008, overloading of trains was found by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) to be a significant cause of delays. A survey undertaken by RailCorp in September 2011 revealed that 6 of the 13 lines had a maximum load that exceeded 135% (of the seated capacity) during the peak morning commute.

===Public perception===
One result of CityRail&#x27;s increasing problems was a sharp rise in public complaints and attacks against staff, with a Boston Consulting Group report claiming staff were actively hiding from irate customers wishing to complain about the service. The highly negative public perception of transit officers acting as ticket inspection officers and charging significant on-the-spot fines has also led to the organisation introducing anti-spitting fines and signage requesting commuters not abuse staff.

<text>The Regional Municipality of Waterloo (Waterloo Region or Region of Waterloo) is a metropolitan area of Southern Ontario, Canada. It contains the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo (KWC or Tri-Cities), and the townships of North Dumfries, Wellesley, Wilmot and Woolwich. Kitchener, the largest city, is the seat of government.

The region is in area, with a population of 587,165 as of the 2021 Canada census, though an end of 2023 estimate puts the population above 673,910 people. Waterloo Region forms the tenth-largest metropolitan area in Canada, with recent population growth almost entirely fuelled by international students. In 2016, the Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge area was rated Canada&#x27;s third-best area to find full-time employment.

The region was formerly called Waterloo County, created in 1853 and dissolved in 1973. The county consisted of five townships: North Dumfries, Waterloo, Wellesley, Wilmot, and Woolwich.

==History==

Early Archaic hunters of the Bifurcate Base tradition were present in the area around 8300 years ago. They occupied the Kassel site (AiHd-71), a base camp, and the Blue Dart site (AiHd-89), which was likely a kill site; this followed typical hunter-gatherer occupation patterns.

Up to the 17th century, the Attawandaron (Neutral) nation inhabited the Grand River area. European explorers admired their farming practices.

In the wake of a smallpox epidemic and European incursions, the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and the Wendat (Huron) Confederacies waged war from 1642 to 1650. Invasion by the Haudenosaunee&#x27;s Seneca and Mohawk nations ended Attawandaron independence.

In 1784, in recognition of Haudenosaunee support during the American War of Independence and the consequent loss of its land in New York state, the British government granted the Grand River valley to the Confederacy. The latter settled in the lower Grand River Valley, the present Brant County, and sold land in the upper Grand, now part of Waterloo Township, to Loyalist Colonel Richard Beasley. In 1816, William Dickson, a Scottish-born land speculator, acquired along the Grand River, in present North and South Dumfries Townships, and the city of Cambridge.

===North and South Dumfries Townships===

Dickson planned to divide the tract into lots to sell to Scottish settlers. He and American-born miller, Absalom Shade, chose the confluence of Mill Creek and the Grand River to found Shade&#x27;s Mills. In 1825, the growing settlement had a post office.

Despite settlers&#x27; reluctance, Dickson renamed the settlement Galt in honour of John Galt, a Scottish novelist and Canada Company Commissioner. Galt&#x27;s visit in 1827 brought wider acceptance to the name change.

Initially serving local farmers, Galt&#x27;s industrial development in the late 1830s eventually earned it the nickname &quot;The Manchester of Canada&quot;. It remained the area&#x27;s main town until Berlin overtook it at the beginning of the 20th century.

===Kitchener-Waterloo===
====Pre-modern era====
According to the City of Waterloo, indigenous people lived in the area, including the Haudenosaunee, Anishinaabe and the Neutral Nation.

One report states that at least two &quot;aboriginal settlements from the 1500s can now be identified near Schneider and Strasburg Creeks&quot; in Kitchener. The finds include the remains of a First Nations village, estimated to be 500 years old, discovered in 2010 in the Strasburg Creek area with &quot;artifacts going back as far as 9,000 years&quot;. In 2020, a site at Fischer-Hallman Road was found to include artifacts from a &quot;Late Woodland Iroquois village&quot; that was inhabited circa 1300 to 1600. Archeologists found some 35,000 objects including stone tools and a 4,000 year old arrowhead.

====1800 to 1820====
Settlement of the later Waterloo Township started in 1800 (in an area that is now Kitchener) by Joseph Schoerg (later called Sherk) and Samuel Betzner Jr. (brothers-in-law), Mennonites, from Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Joseph Schoerg and his wife settled on Lot No.11, B.F. Beasley Block, S.R., on the bank of the Grand River opposite Doon, and Betzner and his wife settled on the west bank of the Grand River, on a farm near an area that is now the village of Blair.

As of March 2021, the homes built by these families&#x27; next generation still stand on Pioneer Tower Road, Kitchener. Built circa 1830, they are listed as historically important: the John Betzner homestead (restored) and the David Schoerg farmstead (not yet restored).
Other settlers followed, mostly from Pennsylvania, and also purchased land in Block Number 2, German Company Tract from Richard Beasley who had acquired a massive territory previously owned by the Six Nations.

The first school opened in 1802 near the village of Blair, then known as Shinglebridge; it became part of Preston, Ontario and then part of Cambridge, Ontario. The first teacher&#x27;s name was Mr. Rittenhaus.

After 1803, many Pennsylvania pioneers bought lots from the German Company, established by Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The 60,000-acre section included most of Block 2 of the former Grand River Indian Lands acquired by Beasley and previously owned by the Six Nations Indians. Many farms were 400 or more acres in size.

Most settlers before 1830 were Pennsylvania Mennonites, often called Pennsylvania Dutch (an anglicization of &quot;Deutsch&quot;) because of the German dialect they spoke from their origins in Germany and Switzerland.

By the early 1800s, a corduroy road had been built along what is now King Street in Waterloo; its remains were unearthed in 2016. The road was probably built by Mennonites using technology acquired in Lancaster County Pennsylvania, between the late 1790s and 1816. The log road was buried in about 1840 and a new road built on top of it. A historian explained that the road had been built for access to the mill but was also &quot;one of the first roads cut through (the woods) so people could start settling the area&quot;.

In 1806, Abraham Erb, from Franklin County, bought 900 acres (360 ha) from the German Company in what would be later part of the City of Waterloo. The putative founder of the city, Erb built a sawmill in 1808 and a gristmill in 1816; the latter operated for 111 years and still stands in Waterloo Park.

Benjamin Eby arrived from Lancaster County in 1806. The putative founder of Kitchener, he purchased a large tract in that area. The settlement, Ebytown, was on the south-east side of present-day Queen Street. Ordained a Mennonite pastor in 1809, and later a bishop, Eby oversaw the building of the first church in 1813 and the confession&#x27;s subsequent growth. Many Mennonite meeting houses, or places of worship, were basic frame buildings, a structure still common among Old Order Mennonites in rural Waterloo Region. Settlers often held a &quot;bee&quot; to help newcomers erect large buildings, a custom that persists today among traditional Mennonite communities. 

In 1806, Joseph Schneider, of south German stock, arrived from Lancaster County. He bought lot 17 of the German Company Tract of block 2. A farmer, he helped build what became &quot;Schneider&#x27;s Road&quot;. By 1816, he had built a sawmill.

In 1807, Pennsylvanians John and Jacob Erb, among others, purchased 45,195 acres (182.9 km2) of Block 3 (Woolwich township).

The War of 1812 interrupted immigration from the United States. The pacifist Mennonite settlers were employed in camps, hospitals and transportation.

Samuel and Elia Schneider arrived in 1816.

A network of small settlements emerged. Abram Weber settled on the corner of later King and Wilmot Streets, and David Weber by the later Grand Trunk Railway station.

Benjamin Eby encouraged manufacturers to move to Ebytown. Jacob Hoffman arrived around 1830 to start the regions&#x27;s first furniture factory.

====1820 to 1852====
Immigration continued strongly in the 1820s, driven by a severe agricultural depression in Lancaster County. John Eby, druggist and chemist, arrived from Pennsylvania about 1820 and opened a shop west of present-day Eby Street. In the same year, after clearing a farm and creating a rough road, Joseph Schneider built a frame house on the south side of the future Queen Street; the renovated home still stands. The settlement around &quot;Schneider&#x27;s Road&quot; became the nucleus of Berlin.

In 1830, Phineas Varnum established the centre of later Berlin (Kitchener). Leasing land from Joseph Schneider, he opened a blacksmith shop on the site of the later Walper House (now the Walper Hotel). A tavern and store opened there at the same time. Still considered a hamlet, Ebytown became Berlin in 1833.

By 1830, the village of Preston was a thriving business centre under the impulse of Jacob Hespeler, a native of Württemberg. He later moved to the village of New Hope, renamed Hespeler in 1857 in recognition of his enterprise and public service. Jacob Beck, from the Grand Duchy of Baden, founded the village of Baden in Wilmot Township and started a foundry and machine shop. Jacob Beck was the father of Sir Adam Beck, founder of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario.

By 1835, many immigrants were coming to Waterloo County from Germany and the British Isles. The Germans settled in areas like New Germany in the Lower Block of Block Two. In 1835, some 70% of the population was Mennonite; by 1851, that number had declined to 26% of a much larger population.

The county&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;Canada Museum und Allgemeine Zeitung,&quot; came off the press on August 27, 1835. Written mostly in German with some English articles, it was published for five years.

By the 1840s, the growing German-speaking population had made the area a popular choice for German immigrants. They founded communities in the south of the Mennonite area. The largest was Berlin (now Kitchener).

In 1841, the population count was 4,424. &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 states that the population of Waterloo Township, within Waterloo County, consisted primarily of Pennsylvania Mennonites and German immigrants who had brought money with them. Many spoke no English. There were now eight grist and twenty saw mills in the township. In 1846 the village of Waterloo had a population of 200, &quot;mostly Germans&quot;. It had a grist mill, a sawmill and some tradesmen. Berlin (Kitchener) had a population of about 400, also &quot;mostly German&quot;, and more tradesmen than the village of Waterloo.

====After 1852====

Previously part of the United County of Waterloo, Wellington and Grey, Waterloo became a separate entity in 1853, with five townships. Galt and Berlin contended to be the county seat; one requirement was the construction of a courthouse and jail. When local merchant Joseph Gaukel donated a small portion of his land for that purpose at the corner of present current Queen and Weber streets, Berlin was selected. A courthouse and gaol were built within a few months.

The first county council meeting was held in the new facility on 24 January 1853. Both buildings figure in the Canadian Register of Historic Places. The council included 12 members from the five townships and two villages; Dr. John Scott was appointed as the first warden (reeve). In the following years, the region&#x27;s physical and social infrastructure developed to include roads, bridges, agricultural societies, markets, and schools.

The Grand Trunk railway reached Berlin in 1856, accelerating industrial growth. Over the next decade, comfortable homes replaced the early settlers&#x27; log cabins.

====House of Industry and Refuge====

In 1869, the county built a large &quot;Poorhouse&quot; with an attached farm, the House of Industry and Refuge. It accommodated some 3,200 people before being closed down in 1951 and later demolished. Located on Frederick St. in Kitchener, behind the now Frederick Street Mall, it sought to help indigents and convicts before social welfare programmes became available. A 2009 report by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; stated that &quot;pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work&quot;.

====Electric streetcar====

A new streetcar system, the Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway (later called the Grand River Railway) began operation in 1894, connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover. The electric rail system ended passenger services in April, 1955.

====German heritage====
Some sources estimate that roughly 50,000 European Germans arrived in the Waterloo area from 1830 to 1860. Unlike the largely German-speaking Mennonites from Pennsylvania, the later arrivals – from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and present day and Poland, France and Russia, were of other denominations. The first groups were predominantly Roman Catholic; those who arrive later were primarily Lutheran.

In 1862, German-speaking groups held a &quot;Sängerfest&quot; (&quot;Singer Festival&quot;) that attracted an estimated 10,000 people. The festival continued for several years.

By 1863, Berlin&#x27;s German population exceeded 2,000. the community started the &quot;Friedenfest&quot; to celebrate the German victory in the Franco-Prussian war. The event continued annual until the start of World War I.

By 1871, nearly 55 percent of the population had German origins, including the Pennsylvania Mennonites and European Germans. This group greatly outnumbered the Scots (18 per cent), the English (12.6 per cent) and the Irish (8 per cent). Berlin, Ontario was a bilingual town, with German being the dominant language spoken. More than one visitor commented on the necessity of speaking German in Berlin.

In 1897, the Canadians with origins in Germany raised funds to erect a large monument, with a bronze bust of Kaiser Wilhelm I, in Victoria Park. The monument would be destroyed by townspeople just after the start of World War I.

By the early 1900s, northern Waterloo County – the Kitchener, Waterloo, Elmira area – exhibited a strong German culture and those of German origin made up a third of the population in 1911. Lutherans were the primary religious group. There were nearly three times as many Lutherans as Mennonites at that time. The latter primarily resided in the rural areas and small communities.

Before and during World War I, there was some anti-German sentiment in Canada and some cultural sanctions on the community, particularly in Berlin, Ontario. However, by 1919 most of the population of what would become Kitchener-Waterloo and Elmira were Canadian by birth; over 95 percent had been born in Ontario. 
Those of the Mennonite religion were pacifist, so they could not enlist, while others who were not born in Canada refused to fight against the country of their birth. Anti-German sentiment during World War I was the primary reason for renaming Berlin Kitchener in 1916 to honour British Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, who had died that year when his cruiser was sunk by a German submarine.

The Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower built in 1926 commemorates the settlement by the Pennsylvania Dutch (&quot;Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch&quot; or Pennsylvania German) of the Grand River area in what later became Waterloo County.

The region is still home to the largest population of Old Order Mennonites in Canada, particularly in the areas around St Jacobs and Elmira.
Over time, after WW II, the anti-German sentiment faded. The Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest event, with beer halls and German entertainment, and a large parade, was established in 1969 to honour the Region&#x27;s German heritage. The events typically attract an average of 700,000 people to the county. During the 2016 Oktoberfest parade, an estimated 150,000 people lined the streets along the route.

In the year 2000, the Government of Ontario declared an annual German Pioneers Day to recognize the achievements of settlers from Germany. Each year since then, the Waterloo Region area honours the current families of several such pioneers who had settled in the area.

The Waterloo region remained predominantly German-speaking until the early 20th century, and its German heritage is reflected in the region&#x27;s large Lutheran community and the annual Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest.

There are still traditional Mennonite communities located north of Kitchener-Waterloo. While the best known is St. Jacobs, with its very popular thrice-weekly outdoor market, the community of Linwood has attracted increased tourist volume in recent years due to its highly authentic Mennonite lifestyle.

===Restructuring===

In 1973, the regional municipality style of government was imposed on the county by the provincial government. The cities of Galt, Kitchener, and Waterloo were previously independent single tier municipalities prior to joining the newly formed regional municipality. In that major reorganization, the fifteen towns and townships of the county were reduced to just seven in the new Region of Waterloo. The new city of Cambridge was created through the amalgamation of the City of Galt, the towns of Preston and Hespeler, the Village of Blair, and various parcels of township land. One township vanished when the former Waterloo Township was divided among Woolwich Township and the three cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge. The settlement of Bridgeport was annexed to the city of Kitchener. The settlement of Erbsville was annexed to the city of Waterloo. The former county government was given broader powers as a regional municipality.

Regardless of the resistance, the amalgamation proceeded and became effective 1 January 1973, creating the Region of Waterloo, with Jack A. Young appointed by the provincial government as the first Regional Chair. The region took over many services, including police, waste management, recreation, planning, roads and social services.

Further municipal amalgamation began discussions in the 1990s, with little progress. In late 2005, Kitchener&#x27;s city council voted to visit the subject again, with the possibility of reducing the seven constituent municipalities into one or more cities. A new proposal in 2010 would study only the merger of Kitchener and Waterloo, with a public referendum on whether the idea should be looked into. Kitchener residents voted 2–1 in favour of studying the merger while Waterloo residents voted 2–1 against. Waterloo city council voted against the study.

==Government==
The region&#x27;s governing body is the 16 member Waterloo Regional Council. The council consists of the Regional Chair, the mayors of the seven cities and townships, and eight additional councillors – four from Kitchener and two each from Cambridge and Waterloo.

Beginning in 1978, the Regional Chair was appointed for a 2-year term by the councillors, who were elected by the citizens of Waterloo Region. James E. (Jim) Gray was appointed in 1978. In 1982, the Chair&#x27;s term was extended to 3 years and Jim Gray was appointed for his third term. He retired in 1985. Ken Seiling held the position of Regional Chair from 1985 to 2018, when he declined to run again for the seat. His successor is Karen Redman.

Beginning with the 1997 election, the citizens of Waterloo Region have directly elected the chair. Of the nine regional municipalities in Ontario, Waterloo Region and the Regional Municipality of Halton are the only ones that allow for direct election of the chair.

==Communities==

Within the townships are many communities. Some were once independent and had their own reeves and councils but lost this status in amalgamation. These communities include: Ayr, Baden, Bloomingdale, Breslau, Conestogo, Doon, Elmira, Freeport, Heidelberg, Mannheim, Maryhill, New Dundee, New Hamburg, Petersberg, Roseville, St. Agatha, St. Clements, St. Jacobs, Wellesley, West Montrose, and Winterbourne.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Regional Municipality of Waterloo had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


Immigrants accounted for 22.6% of the region&#x27;s total population according to the 2016 Canadian Census, while visible minorities accounted for 19.0% of the region&#x27;s total population.

==Economy==
Waterloo Region is also experiencing significant commercial growth. The presence of two universities, the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University, acts as a catalyst for high-tech growth and innovation. The region is known for its high concentration of tech companies, such as BlackBerry (formerly Research In Motion), OpenText, Kik, and Maplesoft. As such, it has often been referred to as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Silicon Valley&quot;.

Canada&#x27;s top three fastest growing tech companies are located in the Region: Kitchener&#x27;s ApplyBoard, Intellijoint Surgical, and Waterloo&#x27;s Auvik Networks. The list also includes Kitchener&#x27;s Smile.io, and Vidyard.

===Major employers in the region===
* Waterloo Region District School Board (5,000 employees)
* Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada (6,500 employees)
* Manulife Financial (3,800 employees)
* University of Waterloo (3,500 employees)
* Sun Life Financial (3,300 employees)
* BlackBerry Ltd (3,000 employees)
* Grand River Hospital (2,200 employees)
* ATS Automation Tooling Systems (1,800 employees)
* City of Kitchener (1,700 employees)

==Real estate==
As of October 2023, the average (mean) selling price of a detached home sold on the Multiple Listing System of Waterloo Region was $890,591 (in Canadian dollars), an increase of 1.1 per cent compared to October 2022. The average selling price for an apartment style condominium was $476,166, an decrease of 2.6 per cent from October 2022. These prices are significantly less than prices in Toronto, where the average selling price for a detached home in the 416 area code was $1,718,440 in October 2023, and the average selling price for an apartment style condominium was $729,160.

==Crime rate==
The national average for the crime severity index was 78.10 per 100,000 people in 2022, while the rate was slightly higher for Waterloo Region at 79.12 per 100,000 people. By comparison, the rate for Ontario was 58.47 per 100,000 people, and nearby cities Guelph and London were 60.56 and 73.98 respectively. By comparison, &quot;Canada&#x27;s most dangerous place&quot;, North Battleford, Saskatchewan, had an index of 353 in 2016.

An updated report by Maclean&#x27;s in 2019 ranked the Region as the 49th most dangerous community in Canada, with robbery approximately as prevalent as the Canadian average of 60 incidents per 100,000 people. The region has a homicide rate of 0.89 per 100,000, below the Canadian average of 1.68 per 100,000.

==Services==
Over time, many services have come to be delegated to the jurisdiction of the municipal government. These include police, emergency medical services, waste management, licensing enforcement, recycling, and the public transit system. The main administration of these services is run from Kitchener, however many service offices may be found in different parts of the Region. For example, from a geographically central location in north Cambridge, maintenance operations and the police headquarters are able to manage operations and provide services to the entire service area.

===Health care===
Hospital services in the region are provided by Grand River Hospital which includes a Freeport Campus and St. Mary&#x27;s General Hospital, both located in Kitchener, as well as Cambridge Memorial Hospital. All three were highly ranked for safety in a national comparison study in 2017–2018, particularly the two located in Kitchener, but all would benefit from reduced wait times. Long-term care beds are provided at numerous facilities, including the Village of Winston Park in Kitchener and Saint Luke&#x27;s Place in Cambridge which were promised additional funding by the province in 2018 for expansion.

Grand River Hospital has a capacity of 574-beds; the Freeport location was merged into it in April 1995. That secondary campus provides complex continuing care, rehabilitation, longer-term specialized mental health and other services. The King St. location is also the home of the Grand River Regional Cancer Centre which opened in 2003. St. Mary&#x27;s General Hospital is a 150-bed adult acute-care facility and includes the Regional Cardiac Care Centre with two cardiovascular operating rooms, an eight-bed cardiovascular intensive care unit and 45 inpatient beds.
 As of late 2018, Cambridge Memorial had 143 beds but was in the midst of a major expansion. The general contractor went into receivership in late 2018 and that stalled the process; the new section was not expected to be completed until approximately 2021. The expansion will eventually add 54 new beds and double the size of the Emergency department.

Family doctors are often in short supply, and a source of great concern among residents. Recruiting efforts over the previous 15 years certainly achieved some success as of September 2018, but needed to be continued.

Announced January 2006, as a new School of Medicine, the Waterloo Regional Campus of McMaster University was completed in 2009. In 2018, the campus included &quot;a complete on-site clinical skills laboratory with 4 skills rooms and 2 observation rooms, classrooms with video-conferencing capabilities and a state-of-the-art anatomy lab that was built in 2013 with a high definition video system&quot;, according to the university. Its Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine building includes the Centre for Family Medicine and the University of Waterloo School of Optometry and Vision Science.

==Transportation==
Public transportation is provided by Grand River Transit, which is an amalgamation of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit systems, the latter of which had also served the City of Waterloo for many decades.

In June 2011, regional council approved the plan for a light rail transit (LRT) line from Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo to Fairview Park Mall in south Kitchener, with rapid buses through to Cambridge. In Stage 1, the Ion rapid transit system runs between Waterloo and Kitchener, passing through the downtown/uptown areas. This phase opened in 2019.

Until light rail transit is extended to the downtown Galt area of Cambridge from Kitchener in Stage 2, the rapid transit link will use specially branded buses between Fairview Park Mall and the Ainslie Street Transit Terminal. Other stops for this Ion bus are at Hespeler Road at the Delta, Can-Amera, Cambridge Centre, Pinebush, and Sportsworld. The rapid transit bus uses bus-only priority traffic signals at Pinebush, Sportsworld, and other places to minimize slowdowns at times of heavy traffic.

Construction on the light rail system began in August 2014, and the Stage 1 service was expected to begin in late 2017. In 2016, however, the start date was changed to early 2018 because of delays in the manufacture and delivery of the vehicles by Bombardier Transportation. By March 2017 a single sample-only train car had arrived. All trams were eventually delivered by December 2018 and the service started operating on June 21, 2019.

By late February 2017, plans for the Stage 2 (Cambridge section) of the Ion rail service were in the very early stage with public consultations just getting started. (At least one journalist has pointed out the similarity between this plan and the electric Grand River Railway of the early 1900s.) As the original plan to share the CP Rail line had become unworkable since the original route had been planned, a new route between Kitchener and Preston was proposed. Multiple options for the new Stage 2 route were researched and presented to the public, with Regional Council approving the final route and preliminary design on April 22, 2020, and starting the required environmental assessment later in December.

Waterloo Region was the home of the first carsharing organization in Ontario in 1998. Community CarShare Cooperative (previously known as Grand River CarShare) provides access to vehicles on a self-serve, pay-per-use basis. Cars are located in many neighbourhoods around the Region. It is meant to complement other sustainable modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and carpooling, or act as a transition out of owning a vehicle. Community CarShare has 27 vehicles stationed in the Region of Waterloo.

The region also owns and operates the Region of Waterloo International Airport, near Breslau. The airport is the 20th busiest in Canada as of December 2010 and underwent a major expansion in 2003. GO Transit and Via Rail provide rail services to the region on the Kitchener line.

<text>Continental Tire the Americas, LLC, d.b.a. General Tire, is an American manufacturer of tires for motor vehicles, and semi trucks. Founded in 1915 in Akron, Ohio by William Francis O&#x27;Neil, Winfred E. Fouse, Charles J. Jahant, Robert Iredell, and H.B. Pushee as The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company using funding from Michael O&#x27;Neil, William Francis O&#x27;Neills&#x27; father, who owned Akron&#x27;s O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s Department Store. The company later diversified by 1984 into a conglomerate (GenCorp, Inc.) with holdings in tire manufacturing (General Tire, Inc.), rubber compounds (DiversiTech General), rocketry and aeronautics (Aerojet), and broadcasting (RKO General).

The company&#x27;s tire division was sold to Germany&#x27;s Continental AG in 1987, becoming &quot;Continental General Tire Corp.&quot; before its reincorporation again to its current name. The compounds division was spun off &amp; became OMNOVA Solutions Inc. The rocketry and aeronautics business was kept and expanded, and after a couple company name changes, the parent company eventually became Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.

==History==
=== Earlytomid20th century ===
===Tire division===
William Francis O&#x27;Neil owned a Firestone Tire and Rubber Company franchise in Kansas City, Missouri. He started a small manufacturing facility for tire repair products, and called it The Western Rubber &amp; Supply Company initially, then The Western Tire &amp; Rubber Company.

As Firestone grew, it sold additional franchises, reducing the territories of its earlier franchisees. Dissatisfied, O&#x27;Neil decided to compete with Firestone instead, using the expertise he had gained with Western Tire and Rubber. He went into partnership with four other men, using funding gained from his father, and formed The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company on September 29, 1915 using $200,000 USD in capital borrowed from the store. O&#x27;Neil &amp; his associates hired away some Firestone managers.

Initially, they focused on repair materials, as with Western Tire &amp; Rubber Company, but in 1916 they expanded into tire manufacturing, focusing on highend products.

 Early products included:

* &quot;General Jumbo&quot;, a premium replacement tire for Ford Model Ts.
* Lowpressure &quot;General Balloon Jumbo tire.&quot;
* &quot;Dual 90 tires&quot;.
Despite the difficult business climate of World War I, in 1917, O&#x27;Neil established a dealership network and began an advertising campaign. By 1930, the company had 14 retail stores and about 1.8% of the tire market. During the depression, as competitors failed, The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company bought out Yale Tire and Rubber Company, and India Tire and Rubber Company. By 1933, it had increased market share to 2.7%. This was a relatively large number, considering that the company limited its product line.

In the postwar years, The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company gradually ceased to be exclusively a tire manufacturer and marketer. It entered the entertainment business, followed by tennis ball, wrought iron, and soft drink production, as well as chemicals and plastics manufacturing; in the early 1980s General Tire even began motion picture and video production.

==Conglomeration==

===Radio, television, and film division===
Because the Depression was particularly hard on manufacturing, The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company bought several Ohio radio stations on which it advertised. In 1943, it diversified the core business strategy, purchasing the Yankee Network and the radio stations it owned from Boston&#x27;s Shepard Stores, Inc. Thomas F. O&#x27;Neil, son of the founder William F. O&#x27;Neil, served as New York Yankees chairman with Shepard&#x27;s John Shepard III serving as president.

The company continued its move into broadcasting by acquiring the Don Lee Broadcasting System, a wellrespected regional radio network on the West Coast, in 1950. Among other stations, it added KHJ-AMFM in Los Angeles, California and KFRC-AM-FM in San Francisco, California to its stable from the New York Yankees acquisition. In 1952, it bought WOR/WOR-FM/WOR-TV in New York City and merged its broadcasting interests into a new division, General Teleradio (purchased from R. H. Macy &amp; Company alongside WOR &amp; Bamberger Broadcasting; named as a result of The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company&#x27;s increased investment in WOR). RKO/General also added Canadian 50,000 watt power house CKLW in Windsor to the family. The &quot;Big 8&quot; was No. 1 in the Detroit market.

The company&#x27;s final move into entertainment was the acquisition of RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes in 1955 for $25 million. The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company was interested mainly in using the RKO film library to program its television stations, so it sold the RKO lot at Sunset and Gower in Hollywood, California to Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz&#x27;s Desilu Productions in 1956 for $6 million. The remaining assets of RKO were merged with General Teleradio, and the new company became known initially as RKO Teleradio Pictures, then RKO Teleradio, before eventually becoming RKO General. The radio stations became some of the leading broadcasters in the world, but the division was dragged down by unethical conduct at its television stations. This culminated in the longest licensing dispute in television history, eventually forcing RKO General out of the broadcasting business by 1991.

====Rocketry and aeronautics division====

In the late 1930s, the United States Army became interested in rockets. A group of California Institute of Technology engineers won a contract to produce rocket engines to speed airplane liftoff, and formed a company named Aerojet. The group succeeded with liquidfuel rockets, but needed additional materials science and manufacturing expertise to create more sophisticated solidfuel rockets. Aerojet went into partnership with The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company, using their capitalization, expertise with rubber binders, and chemical manufacturing facilities. The partnership was renamed Aerojet General.

==Reincorporation and sale to Continental AG==
General Tire&#x27;s restructuring plan went forward; General Tire and its industrial products, and chemicals, and plastics divisions, along with Aerojet General and RKO General, Inc., became subsidiaries of the holding company GenCorp, Inc. in 1984.

In 1987, GenCorp, Inc. underwent largescale restructuring, in part to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by General Acquisition, Inc.

GenCorp, Inc. sold its flagship tire division General Tire to German tire manufacturer Continental AG in 1987. General Tire still exists today as part of Continental Tire of North America.

<doc id="259128" wikidata="Q46751" url="?curid=259128" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">
<text>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. It is the fourth novel in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry&#x27;s name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete.

The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. In both countries, the release date was 8 July 2000. This was the first time a book in the series was published in both countries at the same time. The novel won a Hugo Award, the only &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novel to do so, in 2001. The book was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, and a video game by Electronic Arts.

==Plot==

During the summer, there is an attack at the Quidditch World Cup. The cloaked assailants resemble Death Eaters, the followers of Voldemort. When the school term begins at Hogwarts, Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody is introduced as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Dumbledore announces that students from the foreign wizarding schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving at Hogwarts to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. An artefact called the Goblet of Fire is placed in the main hall, and students are invited to nominate themselves for the tournament by putting their name into it. Although Harry does not nominate himself, he is mysteriously selected to compete against the older students Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour and Viktor Krum.

Harry is interviewed by the &quot;Daily Prophet&quot; reporter Rita Skeeter, who writes a scathing article portraying him as a disturbed attention-seeker. Using the Hogwarts Floo Network, Harry speaks with his godfather, Sirius Black, who warns him about the Durmstrang principal, Igor Karkaroff, who is a former Death Eater. Sirius believes Harry&#x27;s selection for the dangerous tournament is somehow connected to the attack at the World Cup. Hagrid alerts Harry that the First Task involves a dragon. After Moody reminds Harry that he is an expert flyer, Harry uses his broomstick to fly past the dragon and accomplish the task.

As Christmas approaches, Harry asks a girl named Cho Chang to the Yule Ball, but she is already going with Cedric. Harry and Ron end up going to the ball with the twin sisters Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron is sullen as he observes Hermione dancing with Krum. As the Second Task nears, Harry learns that he will need to rescue someone from the lake. The house-elf Dobby gives him Gillyweed, which allows him to breathe underwater long enough to rescue both Ron and Fleur&#x27;s sister Gabrielle. He is awarded extra points for his bravery and is tied for first place.

In the Third Task, Harry and his competitors must navigate a maze of obstacles to reach the Triwizard Cup. Harry and Cedric reach the Cup at the same time and decide to grab it together. They are immediately transported to a graveyard, where Peter Pettigrew kills Cedric and subdues Harry. Using Harry&#x27;s blood, he performs a ritual that returns Voldemort to bodily form. As Voldemort and Harry duel, their wands magically connect. This distraction allows Harry the chance to escape back to Hogwarts with the Cup and Cedric&#x27;s body.

Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape discover that Moody is actually the Death Eater Barty Crouch Jr. When they administer him a truth potion, he reveals that he placed Harry&#x27;s name in the Goblet, supported him through the Tasks, and ensured he was transported to the graveyard for the ritual. Crouch Jr is handed over to the Dementors, who render him soulless with the Dementor&#x27;s Kiss. Recovering in the hospital wing, Harry narrates the events to Cedric&#x27;s parents. He offers them his tournament winnings, but they refuse it, so he gives the gold to Fred and George Weasley so they can open their joke shop. During a memorial service for Cedric, Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Voldemort has returned.

==Development==
&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is the fourth book in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. The first, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997. The second, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, was published on 2 July 1998. The third, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, followed on 8 July 1999. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is almost twice the size of the first three books (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she &quot;knew from the beginning it would be the biggest of the first four.&quot; She said there needed to be a &quot;proper run-up&quot; for the conclusion and rushing the &quot;complex plot&quot; could confuse readers. She also stated that &quot;everything is on a bigger scale,&quot; which was symbolic, as Harry&#x27;s horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.

Until the official title&#x27;s announcement on 27 June 2000, the book was called by its working title, &quot;Harry Potter IV&quot;. Previously, in April, the publisher had listed it as &quot;Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament&quot;. However, J. K. Rowling expressed her indecision about the title in an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interview.
&quot;I changed my mind twice on what [the title] was. The working title had got out — &quot;Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament&quot;. Then I changed &quot;Doomspell&quot; to &quot;Triwizard Tournament&quot;. Then I was teetering between &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; and &quot;Triwizard Tournament&quot;. In the end, I preferred &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; because it&#x27;s got that kind of &quot;cup of destiny&quot; feel about it, which is the theme of the book.&quot;

Rowling mentioned that she originally wrote a Weasley relative named Mafalda, who, according to Rowling, &quot;was the daughter of the &#x27;second cousin who&#x27;s a stockbroker&#x27; mentioned in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts.&quot; Mafalda was supposed to be a Slytherin and was to fill in the Rita Skeeter subplot, but she was eventually removed because &quot;there were obvious limitations to what an eleven-year-old closeted at school could discover.&quot; Rowling considered Rita Skeeter to be &quot;much more flexible.&quot; Rowling also admitted that the fourth book was the most difficult to write at the time because the Mafalda character also served as a giant plot hole, which she discovered halfway through writing.

==Themes==
Jeff Jensen, who interviewed Rowling for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2000, pointed out that bigotry is a big theme in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels and &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; in particular. He mentioned how Voldemort and his followers are prejudiced against Muggles and how, in &quot;Goblet of Fire,&quot; Hermione forms a group to liberate Hogwarts&#x27; house-elves who have &quot;been indentured servants so long they lack desire for anything else.&quot; When asked why she explored this theme, Rowling replied,

She also commented that she did not feel this was too &quot;heavy&quot; for children, as it was one of those things that a &quot;huge number of children at that age start to think about.&quot;

==Publication and reception==
===UK/US release===
&quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; was the first book in the Harry Potter series to be released in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did not have to worry about school conflicting with buying the book. It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies. It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone. FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfil book deliveries. The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry&#x27;s father emerging first from Voldemort&#x27;s wand; however, as confirmed in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, James died first, so then Harry&#x27;s mother ought to have come out first. This was corrected in later editions.

====Launch publicity====
To publicise the book, a special train named &quot;Hogwarts Express&quot; was organised by Bloomsbury, and run from King&#x27;s Cross to Perth, carrying J.K. Rowling, a consignment of books for her to sign and sell, also representatives of Bloomsbury and the press. The book was launched on 8 July 2000, on platform 1 at King&#x27;s Cross – which had been given &quot;Platform &quot; signs for the occasion – following which the train departed. En route it called at Didcot Railway Centre, , the Severn Valley Railway, (overnight stop), Manchester, Bradford, , the National Railway Museum (overnight stop), Newcastle, Edinburgh, arriving at Perth on 11 July. The locomotive was &quot;West Country&quot; class steam locomotive no. 34027 &quot;Taw Valley&quot;, which was specially repainted red for the tour; it later returned to its normal green livery (the repaints were requested and paid for by Bloomsbury). The coaches of the train included a sleeping car. A Diesel locomotive was coupled at the other end, for use when reversals were necessary, such as the first stage of the journey as far as Ferme Park, just south of . The tour generated considerably more press interest than the launch of the film &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; which was premiered in London the same weekend.

===Critical reception===
Upon release, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; received mostly positive reviews. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several British publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot; review under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported an average rating of 8.4 out of 10 for the book based on reviews from multiple British and American newspapers. On &quot;BookBrowse&quot;, based on American and British press, the book received a from &quot;Critics&#x27; Consensus&quot; and for the media reviews on a rating scale out of five: &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;London Times&quot;, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviews under five. 

In &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review, author Stephen King stated the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; was &quot;every bit as good as Potters 1 through 3&quot; and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that &quot;there&#x27;s also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it&#x27;s a teenage thing&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it &quot;another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is&quot;. However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two &quot;bad guys&quot; stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave &quot;many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable&quot;. For &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot;, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying &quot;some will find [it] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs&quot;. A &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; review praised the book&#x27;s &quot;red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience&quot; and saying it &quot;might be her most thrilling yet.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Joan Acocella noted that &quot;where the prior volumes moved like lightning, here the pace is slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim.&quot;

Kristin Lemmerman of CNN said that it is not great literature: &#x27;Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the beginning contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.&#x27; Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; the grade of A−, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a &quot;nightmare factory&quot; for young readers.

In 2012 it was ranked number 98 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, major characters deliver memorable lines that capture key themes: Dumbledore warns of the tournament&#x27;s dangers, Moody introduces the lethal Unforgivable Curses, and Voldemort reveals that his power was undone by love. Through these characters’ journeys, the story conveys themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the unified fight against darkness.

===Awards and honours===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; won several awards, including the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel. It won the 2002 Indian Paintbrush Book Award, the third after &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. The novel also won an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award for one of the best books, who claimed it was &quot;more intense than the first three books&quot;. In addition, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; in second place on their list of &quot;The New Classics: Books – The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008&quot;. The Guardian ranked &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; #97 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century.

<doc id="259130" wikidata="Q4706042" url="?curid=259130" title="Alan-A-Dale">
<text>Alan-A-Dale was a cargo motor ship that was built in Denmark in 1938 as Nordvest (lit.: Northwest). In the Second World War the United States requisitioned her in 1941 and renamed her &quot;Alan-A-Dale&quot;. In December 1944 she was sunk by a German submarine off the coast of the Netherlands.

==Building==
Nakskov Skibsværft A/S built &quot;Nordvest&quot; at its yard in Nakskov for D/S Norden, completing her in June 1938. Her registered length was , her beam was , her depth and her tonnages were and . She had twin screws, each driven by a six-cylinder, single-acting, two-stroke diesel engine. Between them, her twin engines were rated at 808 NHP.

A/S Norden registered &quot;Nordvest&quot; at Copenhagen. Her wireless telegraph call sign was OYWQ.

==Service==
After World War II began, &quot;Nordvest&quot; remained in port in the United States. She was one of 84 foreign ships that the US Maritime Commission requisitioned under the Ship Requisition Act, Executive Order No. 8771, signed on 6 June 1941.

The Maritime Commission renamed her &quot;Alan-A-Dale&quot;, transferred her registration to Panama, and her call sign was changed to HPWV. Her name is sometimes referred to as &quot;Alan A. Dale&quot;, but Lloyd&#x27;s Register records her as &quot;Alan-A-Dale&quot;.

The Maritime Commission appointed the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand to manage the ship. She would have been defensively armed, as a contingent of the USN Armed Guard joined her complement.

&quot;Alan-A-Dale&quot; sailed independently for Tocopilla, Chile, arriving there in October 1941, then returned via the Panama Canal to Baltimore in early December. On 15 December 1941, she sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Belfast as part of Convoy HX 165, returning to the United States as part of Convoy ON 59 in January 1942. After another Atlantic crossing, (Convoys HX 179 and ON 89), she sailed alone from Hampton Roads on 1 June 1942, to the Indian Ocean, calling at Cape Town, Abadan, Bahrain and Bombay, before returning via Durban, Trinidad and Guantánamo Bay, and arriving at New York City on 2 November.
&quot;Alan-A-Dale&quot; then took part in operations following Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, sailing between Hampton Roads and Oran three times between December 1942 and July 1943. The ship then returned to Atlantic crossings, making four more return voyages between the East Coast of the United States and ports in Britain between August 1943 and June 1944.

In July 1944, after sailing from New York to Liverpool, she moved to the south coast of England, crossing the English Channel to the Baie de Seine after the Normandy landings, and returning to New York in September 1944. She sailed once more between New York and Liverpool and back in October – November 1944, before sailing from New York in October to the Solent. From there, on 21 December, she sailed as part of Convoy TAM 26, bound for Antwerp.

A German &quot;Biber&quot; midget submarine sank &quot;Alan-A-Dale&quot; in the Westerschelde off Terneuzen on 23 December 1944 at position . All 65 men aboard survived the attack.

The wreck was removed in June 2003 as part of an operation to improve shipping access to Antwerp.

<text>The prime minister of Albania (), officially the prime minister of the Republic of Albania (), is the head of government of Albania. The office of the prime minister is a core institution in the politics of Albania formed after the Albanian declaration of independence on 28 November 1912. Since that time, the nation has navigated a dynamic political evolution spanning distinct periods, encompassing a monarchy, a communist regime and the eventual democratic order. In 1912, Ismail Qemali was inaugurated as the first prime minister of Albania, guiding the nation toward sovereignty amidst the complex conditions in the Balkans. In 1944, Enver Hoxha implemented a radical change in government, transforming Albania into an authoritarian and isolationist communist regime. In 1991, the nation transitioned into a democracy that marked a notable shift, when Fatos Nano emerged as the first post-communist prime minister of Albania.

The office of the prime minister is defined by the constitution of Albania. The appointment begins with general elections, during which parties or political coalitions nominate candidates for the parliament. The leader of the party with the most parliamentary seats becomes a contender for the office of the prime minister. After the results are certified, the president invites the majority leader to propose a prime ministerial candidate who must secure a majority from the parliament for selection. Once selected, the prime minister-elect is mandated to partake in a formal oath-taking ceremony presided over by the president. The prime minister is in charge of forming and guiding the council of ministers, presenting the nation&#x27;s integral policies and coordinating government institutions. Located in Tirana, the Kryeministria is the official workplace of the prime minister and holds a crucial role in facilitating their duties and those of the council. Since September 2013, Edi Rama from the Albanian Socialist Party has served as prime minister.

== History ==

=== 1912–1990 ===

Following the declaration of independence on 28 November 1912, the establishment of the office of the prime minister became an integral part of the constitutional framework of Albania. Amidst the formative period characterised by tumultuous political and regional conflicts, a series of distinguished ministers assumed the position, each confronted with distinct challenges that left a lasting impact on Albanian politics. Ismail Qemali occupied the mantle of the first prime minister and directed the Albanian people toward the realisation of Independent Albania. Subsequently, during their respective tenures as prime ministers from 1914 to 1920, Turhan Përmeti and Esad Toptani were instrumental in directing Albania through the challenges of World War I. This period was marked by their dedication to preserving the nation&#x27;s independence in the face of shifting alliances and external interventions. Similarly, the emergence of Ilias Vrioni as prime minister in 1920 occurred in the aftermath of World War I, and Vrioni addressed border disputes with the backing of several major Western nations that guaranteed Albania&#x27;s sovereignty within the boundaries formed in 1913. Following these developments, Ahmet Zogu served as prime minister in 1922, concentrating on centralising power, modernising the economy and attracting foreign investments. In 1924, Fan Noli&#x27;s brief tenure saw the introduction of sweeping reforms, including initiatives in education and land distribution aimed at reshaping the socio-economic landscape, alongside the establishment of the Albanian Orthodox Church. Zogu returned as prime minister for a second term in 1925 and further solidified his influence, ultimately transitioning the nation into a monarchy in 1928, with himself as king.

With the global crisis of the Great Depression, Albania grappled with significant economic and financial challenges from 1930 to 1939. The government was tasked with stabilising the economy and fostering socio-economic growth. During this period, a succession of prime ministers, including Kostaq Kotta, Pandeli Evangjeli and Mehdi Frashëri, led the nation. Amid World War II, despite declaring neutrality, Albania was invaded by Italy. Prime Ministers of the era, including Shefqet Vërlaci and Mustafa Merlika-Kruja, assumed significant roles in navigating the challenges posed by foreign occupation. In 1943, Germany occupied the nation, leading to the brief prime ministerial tenures of Rexhep Mitrovica, Fiqri Dine and Ibrahim Biçakçiu during the occupation. With the conclusion of World War II in Albania, the nation entered an unprecedented transformative phase under the leadership of Enver Hoxha, who acceded to the mantle of prime minister in 1944. Hoxha&#x27;s tenure was marked by a commitment to Marxism–Leninism, resulting in the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania in 1946. The regime faced multifaceted challenges, encompassing widespread poverty, illiteracy, healthcare crises, and gender inequality. In response, Hoxha initiated a comprehensive modernisation effort aimed at achieving economic and social progress and transitioning Albania into an industrialised society. Mehmet Shehu served as a prominent figure in Hoxha&#x27;s government, holding the position of prime minister for a significant part of the communist period, from 1954 to 1981. He played an essential part in implementing the government&#x27;s policies and exerting influence over the nation&#x27;s direction. Adil Çarçani succeeded Shehu as prime minister and maintained the position for nine years, maintaining Albania&#x27;s isolationist stance in external affairs and alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries.

=== 1991–present ===

After the fall of communism, the office of the prime minister of Albania was restored and a democratic order was established. Responding to widespread protests in December 1990, the government of Ramiz Alia of the Party of Labour granted its approval for the first multi-party elections in March 1991 and the subsequent elections in March 1992. This resulted in the legal recognition of the opposition Democratic Party and paved the way for the admission of other political parties, including the Socialist Party. Subsequently, Fatos Nano emerged as the first post-communist prime minister on 22 February 1991. Nano prioritised the establishment of democratic institutions, the implementation of economic reforms and the reintegration of Albania into the international community. On 4 June 1991, Nano resigned from office due to political and social pressure, allowing Ylli Bufi and Vilson Ahmeti to assume the mantle for a short period, respectively. During their tenures, Albania became a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Aleksandër Meksi became prime minister on 13 April 1992 following the Democratic Party&#x27;s victory in elections in March. His cabinet was dedicated to further advancing democratic and economic development and strengthening Albania&#x27;s international connections. This commitment culminated to the nation&#x27;s accession to the Council of Europe (CoE) in July 1995. However, the tenure of Meksi faced criticism for what some perceived as an increasingly authoritarian approach and allegations of corruption. One of the most notable events during his rule was the outbreak of the 1997 Albanian civil unrest that resulted in a humanitarian crisis and an international intervention.

Following the departure of Meksi on 25 March 1997, Bashkim Fino emerged as prime minister with a commitment to holding early elections in June. Fatos Nano secured his second term as prime minister but faced several challenges, notably in assembling a cabinet, which led to his resignation. Pandeli Majko succeeded Nano as Prime Minister on 28 September 1998 and focused on the preservation of public order and the fight against corruption and organised crime. His cabinet garnered approval for a new constitution through a referendum in November 1998, all amidst continued instability in, and a large influx of refugees from, Albanian-speaking Kosovo. With the resignation of Majko on 29 October 1999, Ilir Meta emerged as prime minister and served until his resignation on 29 January 2002. Following Majko&#x27;s return for his second term on 7 February 2002, Nano assumed the mantle for his third term as prime minister until 3 July 2005. In the July 2005 elections, Sali Berisha emerged as prime minister with a dedication to sustainable economic development and advancing Albania toward European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership. The tenure of Berisha achieved a major milestone when the nation secured NATO membership in April 2009. However, his leadership was marred by increasing allegations of corruption, misappropriation of public funds and interference in public processes. Edi Rama occupied the role as prime minister for three consecutive terms following his party&#x27;s victory in the July 2013 elections. Under his guidance, Albania achieved consistent economic growth and made continuous progress toward EU membership through a series of reforms aimed at socio-economic revitalisation, reinforcement of the rule of law, enhancement of the judicial system and transparency in governance.

== Appointment ==

The process of selecting the prime minister of Albania begins with the conducting of general elections, in which the members of the parliament are elected through a proportional representation system for four-year terms. Political parties or coalitions nominate their candidates for the members of parliament. The leader of the party or coalition which secures the most seats in the parliament emerges as a contender for the role of the prime minister. Once the election results receive official certification, the president extends an invitation to the leader of the party or coalition with the parliamentary majority, urging them to propose a candidate for the position. The nominated candidate subsequently seeks approval from the parliament, with the members of the parliament casting their votes either in favor or against the proposed candidate. The candidate must garner a majority of affirmative votes to secure appointment, thereby confirming their selection as the prime minister. In the event that the appointed prime minister does not secure approval from the parliament, a 10-day window is provided for the president to nominate a new candidate. If, once more, the parliament does not endorse this subsequent nominee, it is granted an additional 10-day period to designate an alternative prime minister. If the parliament remains unable to successfully elect a new prime minister within these defined timeframes, the president retains the prerogative to dissolve the parliament.

Before assuming the office, the prime minister-elect is mandated to partake in a formal oath-taking ceremony presided over by the president. The ceremony, conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the constitution, marks the commencement of the minister&#x27;s official functions. During the oath, the prime minister affirms their allegiance to the constitution and laws, making a commitment to fulfill the functions of their office and prioritise the welfare of the Albanian people:

== Functions ==


Located at Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard in Tirana, the operates as the official workplace of the prime minister and assumes a central role in facilitating the functions of the prime minister and the council of ministers. According to the constitution, the office of the prime minister holds an integral position in the executive arm of government as the head of government. One of the core functions of the prime minister is to form and lead the council of ministers, which include the deputy prime minister and several other ministers. The prime minister selects the members of the council and proposes their appointments for approval by the president. The prime minister is also entrusted with the duty of formulating and presenting the principal general policies of the nation. This task involves ensuring the implementation of legislation endorsed by the council of ministers. Further to these core functions, the prime minister takes on the office of coordinating and supervising the work of both the council and other significant institutions of the government. This ensures the efficient operation of the framework of the government, the resolution of potential conflicts among ministers, the issuance of necessary instructions and an overall contribution to the efficient administration of government functions.

The prime minister has the ability to propose a motion of confidence to the parliament, focusing on significant matters related to bill or decision approval. This motion cannot involve investigations, appointments, immunity or parliamentary functioning. The duration of debate is determined by the conference of chairpersons, with a minimum of 3 minutes per deputy. Voting occurs after at least 3 days from the presentation of the motion. If the motion fails, the prime minister can request the dissolution of the parliament within 48 hours, with the president dissolving parliament within 10 days of the request. Importantly, a motion of confidence cannot be proposed during the consideration of a motion of no confidence. When the prime minister is absent or incapacitated, the deputy prime minister assumes the role of second-in-command to maintain the uninterrupted functioning of the government. Their appointment and dismissal are determined by the council of ministers based on the recommendation of the prime minister.

<text>The D&#x27;Hondt method, also called the Jefferson method or the greatest divisors method, is an apportionment method for allocating seats in parliaments among federal states, or in proportional representation among political parties. It belongs to the class of highest-averages methods. Compared to ideal proportional representation, the D&#x27;Hondt method reduces somewhat the political fragmentation for smaller electoral district sizes, where it favors larger political parties over small parties.

The method was first described in 1792 by American Secretary of State and later President of the United States Thomas Jefferson. It was re-invented independently in 1878 by Belgian mathematician Victor D&#x27;Hondt, which is the reason for its two different names.

== Motivation ==
Proportional representation systems aim to allocate seats to parties approximately in proportion to the number of votes received. For example, if a party wins one-third of the votes then it should gain about one-third of the seats. In general, exact proportionality is not possible because these divisions produce fractional numbers of seats. As a result, several methods, of which the D&#x27;Hondt method is one, have been devised which ensure that the parties&#x27; seat allocations, which are of whole numbers, are as proportional as possible. 
Although all of these methods approximate proportionality, they do so by minimizing different kinds of disproportionality. 
The D&#x27;Hondt method minimizes the largest seats-to-votes ratio. Empirical studies based on other, more popular concepts of disproportionality show that the D&#x27;Hondt method is one of the least proportional among the proportional representation methods. The D&#x27;Hondt favours large parties and coalitions over small parties due to strategic voting. In comparison, the Sainte-Laguë method reduces the disproportional bias towards large parties and it generally has a more equal seats-to-votes ratio for different sized parties.

The axiomatic properties of the D&#x27;Hondt method were studied and they proved that the D&#x27;Hondt method is a consistent and monotone method that reduces political fragmentation by encouraging coalitions. A method is consistent if it treats parties that received tied votes equally. Monotonicity means that the number of seats provided to any state or party will not decrease if the house size increases.

==Procedure==
After all the votes have been tallied, successive quotients are calculated for each party. The party with the largest quotient wins one seat, and its quotient is recalculated. This is repeated until the required number of seats is filled. The formula for the quotient is

formula_1

where:
* is the total number of votes that party received, and
* is the number of seats that party has been allocated so far, initially 0 for all parties.

The total votes cast for each party in the electoral district is divided, first by 1, then by 2, then 3, up to the total number of seats to be allocated for the district/constituency. Say there are parties and seats. Then a grid of numbers can be created, with rows and columns, where the entry in the th row and th column is the number of votes won by the th party, divided by . The winning entries are the highest numbers in the whole grid; each party is given as many seats as there are winning entries in its row.

Alternatively, the procedure can be reversed by starting with a house apportionment that assigns &quot;too many seats&quot; to every party, then removing legislators one at a time from the most-overrepresented party.

==Example==
In this example, 230,000 voters decide the disposition of 8 seats among 4 parties. Since 8 seats are to be allocated, each party&#x27;s total votes are divided by 1, then by 2, 3, and 4 (and then, if necessary, by 5, 6, 7, and so on). The 8 highest entries (in bold text) range from 100,000 down to 25,000. For each, the corresponding party gets a seat. Note that in Round 1, the quotient shown in the table, as derived from the formula, is precisely the number of votes returned in the ballot.

While in this example, parties B, C, and D formed a coalition against Party A. You can see that Party A received 3 seats instead of 4 due to the coalition having 30,000 more votes than Party A.

The chart below shows an easy way to perform the calculation. Each party&#x27;s vote is divided by 1, 2, 3, or 4 in consecutive columns, then the 8 highest values resulting are selected. The quantity of highest values in each row is the number of seats won.

For comparison, the &quot;True proportion&quot; column shows the exact fractional numbers of seats due, calculated in proportion to the number of votes received. (For example, 100,000/230,000 × 8 = 3.48) The slight favouring of the largest party over the smallest is apparent.

A worked-through example for non-experts relating to the 2019 elections in the UK for the European Parliament written by Christina Pagel for UK in a Changing Europe is available.

A more mathematically detailed example has been written by British mathematician Professor Helen Wilson.

==Approximate proportionality under D&#x27;Hondt==
The D&#x27;Hondt method approximates proportionality by minimizing the largest seats-to-votes ratio among all parties.
This ratio is also known as the advantage ratio. In contrast, the average seats-to-votes ratio is optimized by the Webster/Sainte-Laguë method.
For party formula_2, where formula_3 is the overall number of parties, the advantage ratio is

formula_4

where
*formula_5 – the seat share of party formula_6, formula_7,
*formula_8 – the vote share of party formula_6, formula_10.

The largest advantage ratio,

formula_11

captures how over-represented is the most over-represented party.

The D&#x27;Hondt method assigns seats so that this ratio attains its smallest possible value,

formula_12

where formula_13 is a seat allocation 
from the set of all allowed seat allocations formula_14.
Thanks to this, as shown by Juraj Medzihorsky, the D&#x27;Hondt method splits the votes into exactly proportionally represented ones and residual ones. The overall fraction of residual votes is

formula_15

The residuals of party are

formula_16

For illustration, continue with the above example of four parties. The advantage ratios of the four parties are 1.2 for A, 1.1 for B, 1 for C, and 0 for D. The reciprocal of the largest advantage ratio is . The residuals as shares of the total vote are 0% for A, 2.2% for B, 2.2% for C, and 8.7% for party D. Their sum is 13%, i.e., . The decomposition of the votes into represented and residual ones is shown in the table below.

==Jefferson and D&#x27;Hondt==
The Jefferson and the D&#x27;Hondt methods are equivalent. They always give the same results, but the methods of presenting the calculation are different.

The method was first described in 1792 by Statesman and future US President Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to George Washington regarding the apportionment of seats in the United States House of Representatives pursuant to the First United States Census:

Washington had exercised his first veto power on a bill that introduced a new plan for dividing seats in the House of Representatives that would have increased the number of seats for northern states. Ten days after the veto, Congress passed a new method of apportionment, now known as Jefferson&#x27;s Method. It was used to achieve the proportional distribution of seats in the House of Representatives among the states until 1842.

It was also invented independently in 1878 in Europe, by Belgian mathematician Victor D&#x27;Hondt, who wrote in his publication , published in Brussels in 1882:

The system can be used both for distributing seats in a legislature among states pursuant to populations or among parties pursuant to an election result. The tasks are mathematically equivalent, putting states in the place of parties and population in place of votes. In some countries, the Jefferson system is known by the names of local politicians or experts who introduced them locally. For example, it is known in Israel as the Bader–Ofer system.

Jefferson&#x27;s method uses a quota (called a divisor), as in the largest remainder method. The divisor is chosen as necessary so that the resulting quotients, disregarding any fractional remainders, sum to the required total; in other words, pick a number so that there is no need to examine the remainders. Any number in one range of quotas will accomplish this, with the highest number in the range always being the same as the lowest number used by the D&#x27;Hondt method to award a seat (if it is used rather than the Jefferson method), and the lowest number in the range being the smallest number larger than the next number which would award a seat in the D&#x27;Hondt calculations.

Applied to the above example of party lists, this range extends as integers from 20,001 to 25,000. More precisely, any number n for which 20,000 &lt; n ≤ 25,000 can be used.

==Threshold==
The D&#x27;Hondt method reduces political fragmentation by allocating more seats to larger parties. This effect is strongest for small electoral district sizes; for legislatures with many members, elected in a single national list, the effects of using one proportional method rather than another are negligible.

An alternative approach to reduce political fragmentation are electoral thresholds, where any list which does not achieve that threshold will not have any seats allocated to it, even if it received enough votes to have otherwise been rewarded with a seat. Examples of countries using the D&#x27;Hondt method with a threshold are Albania (3% for single parties, 5% for coalitions of two or more parties, 1% for independent individuals); Denmark (2%); East Timor, Spain, Serbia, and Montenegro (3%); Israel (3.25%); Slovenia and Bulgaria (4%); Croatia, Fiji, Romania, Russia and Tanzania (5%); Turkey (7%); Poland (5%, or 8% for coalitions; but does not apply for ethnic-minority parties), Hungary (5% for single party, 10% for two-party coalitions, 15% for coalitions of 3 or more parties) and Belgium (5%, on regional basis). In the Netherlands, a party must win enough votes for one strictly proportional full seat (note that this is not necessary in plain D&#x27;Hondt), which with 150 seats in the lower chamber gives an effective threshold of 0.67%. In Estonia, candidates receiving the simple quota in their electoral districts are considered elected, but in the second (district level) and third round of counting (nationwide, modified D&#x27;Hondt method) mandates are awarded only to candidate lists receiving more than the threshold of 5% of the votes nationally. The vote threshold simplifies the process of seat allocation and discourages fringe parties (those that are likely to gain very few votes) from competing in the elections. Obviously, the higher the vote threshold, the fewer the parties that will be represented in parliament.

The method can cause a &quot;natural threshold&quot;. It depends on the number of seats that are allocated with the D&#x27;Hondt method. In Finland&#x27;s parliamentary elections, there is no official threshold, but the effective threshold is gaining one seat. The country is divided into districts with different numbers of representatives, so there is a natural threshold, different in each district. The largest district, Uusimaa with 33 representatives, has a natural threshold of 3%, while the smallest district, South Savo with 6 representatives, has a natural threshold of 14%. This favors large parties in the small districts.
In Croatia, the official threshold is 5% for parties and coalitions. However, since the country is divided into 10 voting districts with 14 elected representatives each, sometimes the threshold can be higher, depending on the number of votes of &quot;fallen lists&quot; (lists that do not receive at least 5%). If many votes are lost in this manner, a list that gets 5% will still get a seat, whereas if there is a small number votes for parties that do not pass the threshold, the actual (&quot;natural&quot;) threshold is close to 7.15%.
Some systems allow parties to associate their lists together into a single &quot;cartel&quot; in order to overcome the threshold, while some systems set a separate threshold for such cartels. Smaller parties often form pre-election coalitions to make sure they get past the election threshold creating a coalition government. In the Netherlands, cartels (&quot;lijstverbindingen&quot;) (until 2017, when they were abolished) could not be used to overcome the threshold, but they do influence the distribution of remainder seats; thus, smaller parties can use them to get a chance which is more like that of the big parties.

In French municipal and regional elections, the D&#x27;Hondt method is used to attribute a number of council seats; however, a fixed proportion of them (50% for municipal elections, 25% for regional elections) is automatically given to the list with the greatest number of votes, to ensure that it has a working majority: this is called the &quot;majority bonus&quot; (&quot;prime à la majorité&quot;), and only the remainder of the seats are distributed proportionally (including to the list which has already received the majority bonus). In Italian local elections a similar system is used, where the party or coalition of parties linked to the elected mayor automatically receives 60% of seats; unlike the French model though the remainder of the seats are not distributed again to the largest party.

==Variations==

The D&#x27;Hondt method can also be used in conjunction with a quota formula to allocate most seats, applying the D&#x27;Hondt method to allocate any remaining seats to get a result identical to that achieved by the standard D&#x27;Hondt formula. This variation is known as the Hagenbach-Bischoff System, and is the formula frequently used when a country&#x27;s electoral system is referred to simply as &#x27;D&#x27;Hondt&#x27;.

In some cases such as the Czech regional elections, the first divisor (when the party has no seats so far, which is normally 1) was raised to favour larger parties and eliminate small ones. In the Czech case, it is set to 1.42 (approximately formula_17, termed the Koudelka coefficient after the politician who introduced it).

The term &quot;modified D&#x27;Hondt&quot; has also been given to the use of the D&#x27;Hondt method in the additional member system used for the Scottish Parliament, Senedd (Welsh Parliament), and London Assembly, in which after constituency seats have been allocated to parties by first-past-the-post, D&#x27;Hondt is applied for the allocation of list seats, taking into account for each party the number of constituency seats it has won (that is, if a party has won 3 constituency seats, the divisor for that party in the first round will be 4, rather than 1).

In 1989 and 1992, ACT Legislative Assembly elections were conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission using the &quot;modified d&#x27;Hondt&quot; electoral system. The electoral system consisted of the d&#x27;Hondt system, the Australian Senate system of proportional representation, and various methods for preferential voting for candidates and parties, both within and across party lines. The process involves 8 stages of scrutiny. ABC elections analyst Antony Green has described the modified d&#x27;Hondt system used in the ACT as a &quot;monster ... that few understood, even electoral officials who had to wrestle with its intricacies while spending several weeks counting the votes&quot;. It was replaced with the Hare-Clark system from 1995 onward.

Some systems allow parties to associate their lists together into a single kartel in order to overcome the threshold, while some systems set a separate threshold for cartels. In a system of proportional representation in which the country is divided in multiple electoral districts, such as Belgium the threshold to obtain one seat can be very high (5% of votes since 2003), which also favors larger parties. Therefore, some parties pool their voters in order to gain more (or any) seats.

===Regional D&#x27;Hondt===
In most countries, seats for the national assembly are divided on a regional or even a provincial level. This means that seats are first divided between individual regions (or provinces) and are then allocated to the parties in each region separately (based on only the votes cast in the given region). The votes for parties that have not gained a seat at the regional level are thus discarded, so they do not aggregate at a national level. This means that parties which would have gained seats in a national distribution of seats may still end up with no seats as they did not gain enough votes in any region. This may also lead to skewed seat allocation at a national level, such as in Spain in 2011 where the People&#x27;s Party gained an absolute majority in the Congress of Deputies with only 44% of the national vote. It may also skew results for small parties with broad appeal at a national level compared to small parties with a local appeal (e.g. nationalist parties). For instance, in the 2008 Spanish general election, United Left (Spain) gained 1 seat for 969,946 votes, whereas Convergence and Union (Catalonia) gained 10 seats for 779,425 votes.

===Modified d&#x27;Hondt electoral system===
The modified d&#x27;Hondt electoral system is a variant of the d&#x27;Hondt method with an electoral threshold for parties. Votes for parties below the electoral threshold are transferred to other candidates according to the single transferable voting method. This electoral system was used in 1989 and 1992 Australian Capital Territory elections.

== Usage by country ==
The D&#x27;Hondt method is used to elect the legislatures in Åland, Albania, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Aruba, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, the Dominican Republic, East Timor, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Greenland, Guatemala, Hungary (in a mixed system), Iceland, Israel, Italy (in a mixed system), Japan, Luxembourg, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Mozambique, Netherlands, Nicaragua, North Macedonia, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Uruguay and Venezuela. 
In Denmark the D&#x27;Hondt method is used to elect part of the seats in the Folketing and the disproportionality of the D&#x27;Hondt method is corrected with leveling seats with Sainte-Laguë method. The D&#x27;Hondt system is used for the &quot;top-up&quot; seats in the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) and the London Assembly; in some countries for elections to the European Parliament; and was used during the 1997 constitution era to allocate party-list parliamentary seats in Thailand. The system is also used in practice for the allocation between political groups of numerous posts (vice presidents, committee chairmen and vice-chairmen, delegation chairmen and vice-chairmen) in the European Parliament and for the allocation of ministers in the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is also used to calculate the results in German and Austrian works council elections.

<text>Tintagel Castle () is a medieval fortification located on the peninsula of Tintagel Island adjacent to the village of Tintagel (Trevena), North Cornwall in the United Kingdom. The site was possibly occupied in the Romano-British period, as an array of artefacts dating from this period have been found on the peninsula, but as yet no Roman-era structure has been proven to have existed there. It was settled during the early medieval period, when it was probably one of the seasonal residences of the regional king of Dumnonia. A castle was built on the site by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall in the 13th century, during the High Middle Ages. It later fell into disrepair and ruin.

Archaeological investigation into the site began in the 19th century as it became a tourist attraction, with visitors coming to see the ruins of Richard&#x27;s castle. In the 1930s, excavations revealed significant traces of a much earlier high status settlement, which had trading links with the Mediterranean world during the Late Roman period. Two digs in 2016 and 2017 at Tintagel Castle uncovered the outlines of a palace from the 5th or early 6th century (the early medieval period), with evidence of writing and of articles brought in from Spain and from the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Cornwall Archaeological Unit has a five-year project at this site, with a final report expected in 2021. The items found in the digs have spurred interest before this final report, with two television programmes initially aired in 2018 or 2019, one in the UK by the BBC and another in the US by PBS.

The castle has a long association with legends related to King Arthur. This was first recorded in the 12th century when Geoffrey of Monmouth described Tintagel as the place of Arthur&#x27;s conception in his mythological account of British history, &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. Geoffrey told the story that Arthur&#x27;s father, King Uther Pendragon, was disguised by Merlin&#x27;s sorcery to look like Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, the husband of Igraine, Arthur&#x27;s mother.

Tintagel Castle has been a tourist destination since the mid-19th century. While the castle is in the possession of William, Prince of Wales as part of the landholdings of the Duchy of Cornwall, the site is managed by English Heritage.

==History==
===Romano-British period===
In the 1st century AD, southern Britain was invaded and occupied by the Roman Empire. The territory of modern Cornwall was assigned to the Roman administrative region of &quot;civitas Dumnoniorum&quot;, named after the local British tribal group whom the Romans called the Dumnonii. At the time, this south-westerly point of Britain was &quot;remote, under-populated ... and therefore also unimportant [to the Roman authorities] until, during the 3rd century AD, the local tin-streaming industry attracted attention.&quot; Archaeologists know of five milestones or route-markers in Cornwall erected in the Romano-British period. Two of these are in the vicinity of Tintagel, indicating that a road passed through the locality.

Cornish historian and archaeologist Charles Thomas noted in 1993: &quot;So far, no structure excavated on Tintagel Island... can be put forward as a Roman-period settlement, native-peasant or otherwise.&quot; Despite this, a quantity of apparently Romano-British pottery has been unearthed on the site, as has a Roman-style drawstring leather purse containing ten low denomination Roman coins dating between the reigns of Tetricus I (270–272) and Constantius II (337–361). This suggests that &quot;at face-value ... either the Island or the landward area of the later Castle (or both...) formed the scene of third-fourth century habitation&quot; even if no evidence has been found of any buildings dating from this period. Thomas also noted that some of the post-Roman finds in the excavations of 1933–38 were close to the wall known as the Iron Gate which guards access to the plateau from the adjacent cove. He suggests that the vessels bringing such goods might have come to unload at this cove rather than on the dangerous beach of Tintagel Haven.

===Early medieval period===
Roman control collapsed in southern Britain following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the early 5th century and it split into various different kingdoms, each with its own respective chief or king. The former Roman district of &quot;civitas Dumnoniorum&quot; apparently became the Kingdom of Dumnonia, which would have been ruled over by its own monarchy during this early medieval period between the 5th and 8th centuries. It was in this regional background that settlement continued at Tintagel Castle, with the creation of what is known by archaeologists as Period II of the site. However, there has been some dispute amongst archaeologists as to what the site of Tintagel Island was used for in this period. In the mid-20th century, it was typically thought that there was a Celtic Christian monastery on the site, but &quot;since about 1980... [this] thesis... has... had to be abandoned&quot;, with archaeologists now believing that it was instead an elite settlement inhabited by a powerful local warlord or even Dumnonian royalty.

The Devon archaeologist Ralegh Radford excavated at the site from 1933 through to 1938, and he pioneered the hypothesis that Tintagel Castle had been a monastery during Period II. He came to this conclusion based upon some similarities in the structures of the early medieval elements of Tintagel Castle and the 7th-century monastery at the site of Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire.

Archaeologists no longer accept this viewpoint, however. Instead, they now believe that this was an elite settlement in the early medieval period that was inhabited by Dumnonian royalty and their entourage. Archaeologist and historian Charles Thomas believed that they did not stay at Tintagel year-round but that they moved around: &quot;A typical king with his family, relatives, dependants, resident hostages, officials and court-followers, and a private militia or war-band—in all, probably between a hundred and three hundred souls at least—moved around with his cumbersome entourage; at least, when not busy with inter-tribal campaigning or in repelling invaders and raiders.&quot; The site was also made more defensible during this period with a large ditch at the entrance to the peninsula, leaving only a narrow trackway that had to be traversed by anyone approaching the peninsula.Various luxury items dating from this period have been found at the site, namely African and Phocaean red slip, which had been traded all the way from the Mediterranean. Examining this pottery, Charles Thomas remarked that &quot;the quantity of imported pottery from Tintagel [was]... dramatically greater than that from any other single site dated to about 450–600 in either Britain or Ireland&quot;. Carrying on from this, he noted that the quantity of imported pottery from Tintagel was &quot;larger than the combined total of &quot;all&quot; such pottery from &quot;all&quot; known sites [of this period in Britain and Ireland]; and, given that only about 5 per cent of the Island&#x27;s accessible surface has been excavated or examined, the original total of imports may well have been on a scale of one or more complete shiploads, with individual ships perhaps carrying a cargo of six or seven hundred amphorae.&quot; This evidence led him to believe that Tintagel was a site where ships docked to deposit their cargo from southern Europe in the early medieval period.

Archaeological digs by the Cornwall Archaeological Unit funded by English Heritage in 2016 and 2017 at Tintagel Castle uncovered the outlines of a palace from the 5th or 6th century, more amphora shards, and slate with writing on it, dispelling notions that no one knew how to read and write in this era following the collapse of the Roman Empire. The five-year project expects to finish and publish a report in 2021. One find is described briefly in an article; it has been put on display at the site by English Heritage. The findings have stirred much interest for their implications about the Dark Ages in Cornwall after the Roman Empire collapsed. The dig site is described in a television programme with new theories about Early medieval Britain that first aired in the US in 2019. BBC Two aired a documentary in 2018 about the findings at this dig site.

===Late medieval period and early modern periods===

In 1225, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall traded with Gervase de Tintagel, swapping the land of Merthen (originally part of the manor of Winnianton) for Tintagel Castle. A castle was built on the site by Earl Richard in 1233 to establish a connection with the Arthurian legends that were associated by Geoffrey of Monmouth with the area and because it was seen as the traditional place for Cornish kings. The castle was built in a more old-fashioned style for the time to make it appear more ancient. However, the dating to the period of Earl Richard has superseded Ralegh Radford&#x27;s interpretation which attributed the earliest elements of the castle to Earl Reginald de Dunstanville and later elements to Earl Richard. Sidney Toy suggests an earlier period of construction in &quot;Castles: a short history of fortifications from 1600 B.C. to A. D. 1600&quot; (London: Heinemann, 1939).

John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter was appointed constable of Tintagel Castle in 1389. After Richard, the following Earls of Cornwall were not interested in the castle, and it was left to the High Sheriff of Cornwall. Parts of the accommodation were used as a prison and the land was let as pasture. The castle became more dilapidated, and the roof was removed from the Great Hall in the 1330s. Thereafter, the castle became more and more ruinous and there was progressive damage from the erosion of the isthmus that joined the castle to the mainland. John Leland visited in the early 1540s and found that a makeshift bridge of tree trunks gave access to the Island. England was threatened with invasion from Spain in the 1580s, and the defences were strengthened at the Iron Gate. The manor of Tintagel was among those seized by the Commonwealth government of the 1650s as Duchy of Cornwall property, returning to the Duchy upon the Restoration of 1660. The letting for sheep pasture continued until the 19th century.

===19th and 20th centuries===
There was a fascination with the Arthurian legends during the Victorian era, and the ruins of the castle became a tourist destination. The modern day village of Tintagel was known as Trevena until the 1850s when it was found convenient by the Post Office to use the name of the parish rather than the name of the village. Tintagel is only the name of the headland; Tintagel Head itself is the extreme southwest point of Castle Island and the castle ruins are partly on the &#x27;island&#x27; and partly on the adjoining mainland. The head of the island pointing out to sea is Pen Diu ( &quot;Black Head&quot;).

The Rev. R. B. Kinsman (d. 1894) was honorary constable and built the courtyard wall and a guide was employed to conduct visitors into the castle. Until his time, the steps were unsafe on either side of the isthmus, though the plateau could be reached by those who grazed sheep there. From 1870, a lead mine was worked for a short time near Merlin&#x27;s Cave. In the 20th century, the site was maintained by the Office of Works and its successors (from 1929 onwards). In 1975, the access across the isthmus was improved by the installation of a wooden bridge.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries nothing had been excavated except the chapel, and so ideas were given currency such as the garden being a cemetery and King Arthur&#x27;s Footprint being a place for King Arthur to leap to the mainland. &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Footprint&quot; is a hollow in the rock at the highest point of Tintagel Island&#x27;s southern side. It is not entirely natural, having been shaped by human hands at some stage. It may have been used for the inauguration of kings or chieftains, as the site has a long history stretching back to the Dark Ages.

In 1999, there was some controversy regarding Tintagel Castle and other sites in Cornwall under the management of English Heritage. Members of the pressure group Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament removed several signs because they objected to the use of the name &quot;English Heritage&quot;, stating that Cornwall is rightfully a nation on its own. Three men involved in removing the signs were bound over for a year for £500 each and ordered to pay English Heritage £4,500 compensation.

===21st century===
Over three months in 2015–16, artist Peter Graham carved a foot-high bearded face representing Merlin into a rock near a cave known as Merlin&#x27;s Cave (after its mention in Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;). This was done as part of a project by English Heritage to &quot;reimagine Tintagel&#x27;s history and legends across the island site&quot;. The project also includes a compass sculpture referencing the Round Table and a larger-than-life statue called &quot;Gallos&quot;, by Rubin Eynon. Gallos is Cornish for power and its meaning is deliberately ambiguous as the statue could represent King Arthur or Tintagel&#x27;s older royal past. A local councillor accused English Heritage of degrading the site&#x27;s archaeology and landscape, although many local people are content with the image. Plans for a cantilevered steel footbridge to link Tintagel Island and the mainland, designed (by Ney &amp; Partners and William Matthews Associates) to evoke Arthur&#x27;s sword, were approved in 2017, and the bridge was opened to the public on 11 August 2019. Tintagel Castle Footbridge received an RIBA South West Award 2021, and was an RIBA Stirling Prize 2021 finalist.

Tintagel is one of English Heritage&#x27;s top five attractions, with around 200,000 visitors a year and up to 3000 a day in the peak summer season. According to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, 154,996 people visited Tintagel Castle in 2019.

Tintagel Castle was one of six identified by English Heritage in September 2022 as being at risk of destruction due to coastal erosion, the rate of which they said had worsened in the last few years due to rising sea levels and frequent storms. Portions of the Tintagel Castle complex have historically fallen into the sea but by 2022, erosion had reached the front of the visitor centre, and parts of a coastal footpath and a viewing area had fallen into the sea.

In September 2022, English Heritage launched a fundraising campaign to protect and strengthen Tintagel Castle (and the five other at-risk sites).

==Arthurian legends==
The castle has a long association with the Arthurian legends; it was first associated with King Arthur by Welshman Geoffrey of Monmouth in his book &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&#x27;&quot;), written around 1135–38, which includes a detailed account of the legend. According to Geoffrey and the legend, Arthur&#x27;s father was Uther Pendragon, the king of all Britain. He goes to war against Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall, to capture Gorlois&#x27; wife Igraine, with whom Uther has fallen in love. Gorlois defends himself against Uther&#x27;s armies at his fort of Dimilioc, but he sends Igraine to stay safely within Tintagel Castle which is his most secure refuge, according to the legend and &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. Uther besieges Dimilioc, telling his friend Ulfin how he loves Igraine, but Ulfin replies that it would be impossible to take Tintagel, for &quot;it is right by the sea, and surrounded by the sea on all sides; and there is no other way into it, except that provided by a narrow rocky passage—and there, three armed warriors could forbid all entry, even if you took up your stand with the whole of Britain behind you.&quot; Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s story goes on to explain how the wizard Merlin is summoned and magically changes Uther&#x27;s appearance to that of Gorlois to help get them into Tintagel Castle, while also changing his own and Ulfin&#x27;s appearances to those of two of Gorlois&#x27; companions. Disguised thus, they are able to enter Tintagel where Uther goes to Igraine, and &quot;in that night was the most famous of men, Arthur, conceived.&quot;

Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; mentions Tintagel Castle as the site of Arthur&#x27;s conception, but &quot;it nowhere claims that Arthur was born at Tintagel, or that he ever visited the place in later life, or that in any sense the stronghold became his property when he was king.&quot; However, the legend and the book continued to become hugely popular, spreading across Britain in the Late Medieval period, when more Arthurian texts were produced, many of them continuing to propagate the idea that Arthur himself was actually born at Tintagel. There is now a footpath from the site to Cadbury Castle in Somerset called Arthur&#x27;s Way.

However, many continue to argue against these legends. For example, archaeologist C.A. Ralegh Radford refused to believe in the legend and all of the associations, declaring in 1935 that &quot;no concrete evidence whatsoever has yet been found to support the legendary connection of the Castle with King Arthur&quot;. Charles Thomas, a specialist in Cornish history, was unable to find solid links, mainly because legends and stories would have been handed down only orally during this period. Thomas stated in 1993 that &quot;there simply is no independently attested connection in early Cornish folklore locating Arthur, at any age or in any capacity, at Tintagel.&quot; Many others disagree, maintaining that the legendary figure would essentially have been an Early Medieval British leader, involved in fighting the migrating Anglo-Saxons who were settling in Britain at that time. The Artognou stone was found at Tintagel bearing the inscription , and it has been claimed by some to provide evidence for a historical Arthur, but most historians reject this view.

Tintagel is used as a locus for the Arthurian mythos by the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson in the poem &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s 1832 poetical illustration, &quot;A Legend of Tintagel Castle&quot;, to an engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom is another variation on the story of Lancelot and Elaine. Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram of Lyonesse&quot; is a literary version of the Tristan and Iseult legend in which some events are set at Tintagel. Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse&quot;, a one-act play which was published in 1923, is another version of the same legend with events set at Tintagel (the book includes an imaginary drawing of Tintagel Castle at the period).

==Excavations==

In the 1930s, it was decided to begin a major archaeological excavation at the site, and so HM Office of Works employed Devon archaeologist Courtenay Arthur Ralegh Radford (1900–1999) to work as site director. He had been employed as the Inspector of Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire from 1929 and 1934, and from 1936 was Director of the British School at Rome. Excavation began in 1933, and in 1935 Ralegh Radford wrote an interim report and a guidebook entitled &quot;Tintagel Castle&quot;, published by HM Stationery Office. The excavators employed former quarry workers (the last Tintagel cliff quarry was closed in 1937) who worked under a trained foreman. They were instructed to clear the land on the island, following and exposing any walling that they came across and keeping any finds. Excavation ceased in 1939 due to the outbreak of the Second World War. Radford was required to take part in the war effort abroad, and many of the original site reports were destroyed when his house in Exeter was bombed by the Luftwaffe during the conflict.

In the mid-1980s, a fire on Tintagel Island led to considerable erosion of the topsoil, and many more building foundations could be seen than those recorded by Ralegh Radford. In 1998, the &quot;Artognou stone&quot;, a slate stone bearing an incised inscription in Latin, was discovered on there, demonstrating that Latin literacy survived in this region after the collapse of Roman Britain.

Excavations during the summers of 2016 and 2017 found the remains of various structures from the Dark Ages, including well-constructed buildings of relatively large size dated to the 5th and 6th centuries, with pottery and glass finds indicating that the people who lived at Tintagel were of an upper class status, drinking wine imported from the eastern Mediterranean and using food vessels from North Africa and Gaul. In 2017, archaeologists discovered at the castle a 7th century slate window ledge inscribed with a mixture of Latin, Greek, and Celtic words, names, and symbols.

<text>The American Colonization Society (ACS), initially the Society for the Colonization of Free People of Color of America, was an American organization founded in 1816 by Robert Finley to encourage and support the repatriation of freeborn people of color and emancipated slaves to the continent of Africa. It was modeled on an earlier British Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor&#x27;s colonization in Africa, which had sought to resettle London&#x27;s &quot;black poor&quot;. Until the organization&#x27;s dissolution in 1964, the society was headquartered in Room 516 of the Colorado Building in Washington, D.C.

The American Colonization Society was established in 1816 to address the prevailing view that free people of color could not integrate into U.S. society; their population had grown steadily following the American Revolutionary War, from 60,000 in 1790 to 300,000 by 1830. Slave owners feared that these free Black people might help their slaves to escape or rebel. In addition, many White Americans believed that African Americans were inherently inferior and should be relocated.

The African-American community and the abolitionist movement overwhelmingly opposed the project. According to &quot;the colored citizens of Syracuse,&quot; headed by Rev. Jermain Loguen,

In most cases, African American families had lived in the United States for generations, and their prevailing sentiment was that they were no more African than white Americans were British. Contrary to claims that their emigration was voluntary, many African Americans, both free and enslaved, were pressured into emigrating. Indeed, enslavers, such as Zephaniah Kingsley, sometimes freed their slaves on condition that the freedmen leave the country immediately.

According to historian Marc Leepson, &quot;Colonization proved to be a giant failure, doing nothing to stem the forces that brought the nation to Civil War.&quot; Between 1821 and 1847, only a few thousand African Americans, out of millions, emigrated to what would become Liberia, while the increase in Black population in the U.S. during those same years was about 500,000. By 1833, the Society had transported only 2,769 individuals out of the U.S. According to Zephaniah Kingsley, the cost of transporting the Black population of the United States to Africa would exceed the annual revenues of the country. Mortality was the highest since accurate record-keeping began: close to half the arrivals in Liberia died from tropical diseases, especially malaria; during the early years, 22% of immigrants died within one year. Moreover, the provisioning and transportation of requisite tools and supplies proved very expensive.

Starting in the 1830s, the society was met with great hostility from abolitionists, led by Gerrit Smith, who had supported the society financially, and William Lloyd Garrison, author of &quot;Thoughts on African Colonization&quot; (1832), in which he proclaimed the society a fraud. According to Garrison and his many followers, the society was not a solution to the problem of American slavery—it actually was helping, and was intended to help, to preserve it.

==Background==

===Growth of slavery in the South===
After the invention of the cotton gin in the 1790s, the growth and export of cotton became a highly profitable business. Central to the business was the setting up of plantations, staffed by enslaved laborers. Due to the increased demand, imports of African slaves grew until legal importation was barred in 1808, after which time Maryland and Virginia openly bred slaves, &quot;producing&quot; children for sale &quot;South&quot;, through brokers such as Franklin and Armfield, to plantation owners. This resulted in the forcible relocation of about one million enslaved people to the Deep South. The Africans and African Americans became well established and had children, and the total number of the enslaved reached four million by the mid-19th century.

===Growth in the number of free black people===
Due in part to manumission efforts sparked by revolutionary ideals, Protestant preachers, and the abolitionist movement, there was an expansion in the number of free black people, many of them born free. Even in the North, where slavery was being abolished, discrimination against free black people was rampant and often legal. Few states extended citizenship rights to free black people prior to the 1860s and the Federal government, largely controlled by Slave Power, never showed any inclination to challenge the racial status quo. Even in the North, free black people were often seen as unwelcome immigrants, taking jobs away because they would work for cheap.

Some slave owners decided to support emigration following an aborted slave rebellion headed by Gabriel Prosser in 1800, and a rapid increase in the number of free African Americans in the United States in the first two decades after the Revolutionary War, which they perceived as threatening. Although the ratio of white people to black people overall was 4:1 between 1790 and 1800, in some Southern counties black people were the majority. Slaveholders feared that free black people destabilized their slave society and created a political threat. From 1790 to 1800, the number of free black people increased from 59,467 to 108,398, and by 1810 there were 186,446 free black people.

===British &quot;black poor&quot; colonization in Africa===

In 1786, a British organization, the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor, launched its efforts to establish the Sierra Leone Province of Freedom, a colony in West Africa for London&#x27;s &quot;black poor&quot;. This enterprise gained the support of the British government, which also offered relocation to Black Loyalists who had been resettled in Nova Scotia, where they were subject to harsh weather and discrimination from some white Nova Scotians. Jamaica maroons were also deported to the British colony, alongside former slaves freed by the Royal Navy after the Atlantic slave trade was abolished by Britain in 1807.

===Paul Cuffe===

Paul Cuffe or Cuffee (1759–1817) was a successful Quaker ship owner and activist in Boston. His parents were of Ashanti (African) and Wampanoag (Native American) heritage. He advocated settling freed American slaves in Africa and gained support from the British government, free Black leaders in the United States, and members of Congress to take emigrants to the British colony of Sierra Leone. In 1815, he financed a trip himself. The following year, Cuffe took 38 American black people to Freetown, Sierra Leone. He died in 1817 before undertaking other voyages. Cuffe laid the groundwork for the American Colonization Society.
==Early history of the ACS==

===Founding===
The ACS had its origins in 1816, when Charles Fenton Mercer, a Federalist member of the Virginia General Assembly, discovered accounts of earlier legislative debates on black colonization in the wake of Gabriel Prosser&#x27;s rebellion. Mercer pushed the state to support the idea. One of his political contacts in Washington City, John Caldwell, in turn contacted the Reverend Robert Finley, his brother-in-law and a Presbyterian minister, who endorsed the plan.
On December 21, 1816, the society was officially established at the Davis Hotel in Washington, D.C. Among the Society&#x27;s supporters were Charles Fenton Mercer (from Virginia), Henry Clay (Kentucky), John Randolph (Virginia), Richard Bland Lee (Virginia), Francis Scott Key (Washington, D.C., and Maryland), and Bushrod Washington (Virginia). Slaveholders in the Virginia Piedmont region in the 1820s and 1830s comprised many of its most prominent members; slave-owning United States presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and James Madison were among its supporters. Madison served as the Society&#x27;s president in the early 1830s.

At the inaugural meeting of the Society, Reverend Finley suggested that a colony be established in Africa to take free people of color, most of whom had been born free, away from the United States. Finley meant to colonize &quot;(with their consent) the free people of color residing in our country, in Africa, or such other place as Congress may deem most expedient&quot;. The organization established branches throughout the United States, mostly in Southern states. It was instrumental in establishing the colony of Liberia.

The ACS was founded by groups otherwise opposed to each other on the issue of slavery. Slaveholders, such as those in the Maryland branch and elsewhere, believed that so-called repatriation was a way to remove free Blacks from slave societies and avoid slave rebellions. Free black people, many of whom had been in the United States for generations, also encouraged and assisted slaves to escape, and depressing their value. (&quot;Every attempt by the South to aid the Colonization Society, to send free colored people to Africa, enhances the value of the slave left on the soil&quot;.) The Society appeared to hold contradictory ideas: free Blacks should be removed because they could not benefit America; on the other hand, free Blacks would prosper and thrive under their own leadership in another land.

On the other hand, a coalition made up mostly of evangelicals, Quakers, philanthropists, and abolitionists supported abolition of slavery. They wanted slaves to be free and believed Blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the United States, since they were not welcome in the South or North. The two opposed groups found common ground in support of what they called &quot;repatriation&quot;.

===Prestige===
When founded, the ACS was &quot;accepted everywhere as &#x27;a most glorious Christian enterprise&#x27;.&quot; Every church in the land devoted one Sunday a year for a colonization sermon and offering.

===Leadership===
The presidents of the ACS tended to be Southerners. The first president was Bushrod Washington, the nephew of U.S. President George Washington and an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. From 1836 to 1849 the statesman Henry Clay of Kentucky, a planter and slaveholder, was ACS president. John H. B. Latrobe served as president of the ACS from 1853 until his death in 1891.

===Goals===

The colonization project, which had multiple American Colonization Society chapters in every state, had three goals. One was to provide a place for former slaves, freedmen, and their descendants to live, where they would be free and not subject to racism. Another goal was to ensure that the colony had what it needed to succeed, such as fertile soil to grow crops. A third goal was to suppress attempts to engage in the Atlantic slave trade, such as by monitoring ship traffic on the coast. Presbyterian clergyman Lyman Beecher proposed another goal: the Christianization of Africa.

===Fundraising===

The Society raised money by selling memberships. The Society&#x27;s members pressured Congress and the President for support. In 1819, they received $100,000 from Congress, and on February 6, 1820, the first ship, the &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, sailed from New York for West Africa with three white ACS agents and 86 African-American emigrants aboard. The approaches for selecting people and funding travel to Africa varied by state.

==Opposition to colonization==
According to Benjamin Quarles, the colonization movement &quot;originated abolitionism&quot;, by arousing the free Black people and other opponents of slavery.

The following summary by Judge James Hall, editor of the Cincinnati-based &quot;Western Monthly Magazine&quot;, is from May 1834:

(As Hall refused to publish Theodore Weld&#x27;s lengthy reply, he did so in the &quot;Cincinnati Journal&quot;. It became known nationally because Garrison devoted almost the entire front page of the June 14 issue of &quot;The Liberator&quot; to it.)

===Opposition from African-Americans===
From the beginning, &quot;the majority of black Americans regarded the Society [with] enormous disdain&quot;, a &quot;fixed hatred&quot;. Black activist James Forten immediately rejected the ACS, writing in 1817 that &quot;we have no wish to separate from our present homes for any purpose whatever&quot;. As soon as they heard about it, 3,000 black protestors packed a church in Philadelphia, &quot;the bellwether city for free blacks,&quot; and &quot;bitterly and unanimously&quot; denounced it. They published a protest pamphlet.
Frederick Douglass condemned colonization: &quot;Shame upon the guilty wretches that dare propose, and all that countenance such a proposition. We live here—have lived here—have a right to live here, and mean to live here&quot;. Martin Delany, who believed that Black Americans deserved &quot;a new country, a new beginning&quot;, called Liberia a &quot;miserable mockery&quot; of an independent republic, a &quot;racist scheme of the ACS to rid the United States of free blacks&quot;. He proposed instead Central and South America as &quot;the ultimate destination and future home of the colored race on this continent&quot; (see Linconia). A recent (2014) writer on Connecticut African Americans summarizes the attitude amongst them:

While claiming to aid African Americans, in some cases, to stimulate emigration, it made conditions for them worse. For example, &quot;the Society assumed the task of resuscitating the Ohio Black Codes of 1804 and 1807. ...Between 1,000 and 1,200 free blacks were forced from Cincinnati&quot;. A meeting was held in Cincinnati on January 17, 1832, to discuss colonization, which resulted in a series of resolutions. First, they had a right to freedom and equality. They felt honor-bound to protect the country, the &quot;land of their birth&quot;, and the Constitution. They were not familiar with Africa, and should have the right to make their own decisions about where they lived. They recommended that if black people wish to leave the United States, they consider Canada or Mexico, where they would have civil rights and a climate that is similar to what they are accustomed to. The United States was large enough to accommodate a colony, and would be much cheaper to implement. They question the motives of ACS members who cite Christianity as a reason for removing black people from America. Since there were no attempts to improve the conditions of black people who lived in the United States, it is unlikely that white people would watch out for their interests thousands of miles away.

William Lloyd Garrison began publication of his abolitionist newspaper, &quot;The Liberator&quot;, in 1831, followed in 1832 by his &quot;Thoughts on African Colonization,&quot; which discredited the Society. According to President Lincoln, it was &quot;the logic and moral power of Garrison and the antislavery people of the country&quot; that put emancipation on the country&#x27;s political agenda.

Garrison himself had earlier joined the Society in good faith. All the important white future abolitionists supported the Society: besides Garrison, Gerrit Smith, the Tappans, and many others, as can be seen in the pages of the Society&#x27;s magazine, the &quot;African Repository&quot;. Garrison objected to the colonization scheme because rather than eliminating slavery, its key goal, as he saw it, was to remove free black people from America, thereby avoiding slave rebellions. Besides not improving the lot of enslaved Africans, the colonization had made enemies of native people of Africa. Both he and Gerrit Smith were horrified when they learned that alcohol was being sold in Liberia. He questioned the wisdom of sending African Americans, along with white missionaries and agents, to such an unhealthy place. In addition, it meant that fewer slaves achieved their freedom: &quot;it hinders the manumission of slaves by throwing their emancipation upon its own scheme, which in fifteen years has occasioned the manumission of less than four hundred slaves, while before its existence and operations during a less time thousands were set free&quot;.

In the second number of &quot;The Liberator&quot;, Garrison reprinted this commentary from the &quot;Boston Statesman&quot;,

====Gerrit Smith====
The philanthropist and public intellectual Gerrit Smith, the wealthiest man in New York State, had been &quot;among the most munificent patrons of this Society,&quot; as put by Society Vice-President Henry Clay.

This support changed to furious and bitter rejection when he realized, in the early 1830s, that the society was &quot;quite as much an Anti-Abolition, as Colonization Society&quot;. &quot;This Colonization Society had, by an invisible process, half conscious, half unconscious, been transformed into a serviceable organ and member of the Slave Power&quot;. It was &quot;an extreme case of sham reform&quot;. He claimed that the ACS had &quot;ripened into the unmeasured calumniator of the abolitionist, ...the unblushing defender of the slaveholder, and the deadliest enemy of the colored race&quot;. In November 1835, he sent the Society a letter with a check, to conclude his existing commitments, and said there would not be any more from him, because:

In the meeting of forming British African Colonization Society held in London in July 1833, Nathaniel Paul, an abolitionist in support of William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Thoughts on African Colonization&quot;,&quot; argued that a significant number of opponents, including Black Americans in prominent cities of America, found inequality towards the Society because according to him, they were the ones who had remarkably contributed and fought to protect this country as their home through a historical period of generations. However, this Society was then trying to forcefully send them back to their ancestors&#x27; lands as, by that time, they were considered at risk for rebellion in the name of emancipation. In contrast, the new Europeans who had not been part of this country in such events were instead welcomed to settle here.

== Support of free black emigration ==
From 1850 to 1858, according to Martin Delany, a supporter of African Americans&#x27; emigration from the United States to other regions, the creation of a republic was a significant movement to gain independence for the free Black people in America, in contrast to the ideology of staying and fighting for the equality of civil rights of Frederick Douglass. He believed the transition was to exit the rising of slavery and racism toward African Americans in the US. Other destinations he suggested were Central America, the West Indies, or Mexico, where Black people could be more likely to thrive and emphasize their freedom against the influence of White people. Toward this end, in 1858, Delany cofounded the African Civilization Society.

==Colony of Liberia==

In 1821, Lt. Robert Stockton had pointed a pistol to the head of King Peter, which allowed Stockton to persuade King Peter to sell Cape Montserrado (or Mesurado) and to establish Monrovia. In 1825 and 1826, Jehudi Ashmun, Stockton&#x27;s successor, took steps to lease, annex, or buy tribal lands in Africa along the coast and along major rivers leading inland in Africa to establish an American colony. Stockton&#x27;s actions inspired Ashmun to use aggressive tactics in his negotiations with King Peter and in May 1825, King Peter and other native kings agreed to a treaty with Ashmun. The treaty negotiated land to Ashmun and in return, the natives received three barrels of rum, five casks of powder, five umbrellas, ten pairs of shoes, ten iron posts, and 500 bars of tobacco, as well as other items.

Of the 4,571 emigrants who arrived in Liberia between 1820 and 1843, only 1,819—40%—were alive in 1843. The ACS knew of the high death rate, but continued to send more people to the colony.

It is an oversimplication to say simply that the American Colonization Society founded Liberia. Much of what would become Liberia was a collection of settlements sponsored by state colonization societies: Mississippi in Africa, Kentucky in Africa, the Republic of Maryland, and several others. The most developed of these, the Republic of Maryland, had its own constitution, and statutes.

==Publications==
Beginning in 1825, the Society published the &quot;African Repository and Colonial Journal&quot;. Ralph Randolph Gurley (1797–1872), who headed the Society until 1844, edited the journal, which in 1850 simplified its title to the &quot;African Repository&quot;. The journal promoted both colonization and Liberia. Included were articles about Africa, lists of donors, letters of praise, information about emigrants, and official dispatches that espoused the prosperity and continued growth of the colony. After 1919, the society essentially ended, but it did not formally dissolve until 1964, when it transferred its papers to the Library of Congress.

== Civil War and emancipation ==
Early in his presidency, Abraham Lincoln tried repeatedly to arrange resettlement of the kind the ACS supported, but each arrangement failed.

The ACS continued to operate during the American Civil War and colonized 168 black people during the conflict. It sent 2,492 people of African descent to Liberia in the five years following the war. The federal government provided a small amount of support for these operations through the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau.

Some scholars believe that Lincoln abandoned the idea by 1863, following the use of black troops. Biographer Stephen B. Oates has observed that Lincoln thought it immoral to ask black soldiers to fight for the U.S. and then to remove them to Africa after their military service. Others, such as the historian Michael Lind, believe that as late as 1864, Lincoln continued to hold out hope for colonization, noting that he allegedly asked Attorney General Edward Bates if the Reverend James Mitchell could stay on as &quot;your assistant or aid in the matter of executing the several acts of Congress relating to the emigration or colonizing of the freed Blacks&quot;.

By late into his first term as president, Lincoln had publicly abandoned the idea of colonization after speaking about it with Frederick Douglass, who objected harshly to it. On April 11, 1865, with the war drawing to a close, Lincoln gave a public speech at the White House supporting suffrage for blacks, a speech that led actor John Wilkes Booth, who was vigorously opposed to emancipation and black suffrage, to assassinate him three days later.

==Decline and dissolution==
Colonizing proved expensive; under the leadership of Henry Clay the ACS spent many years unsuccessfully trying to persuade the U.S. Congress to fund emigration. The ACS did have some success, in the 1850s, with state legislatures, such as those of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. In 1850, the state of Virginia set aside $30,000 (~$ in ) annually for five years to aid and support emigration. The Society, in its Thirty-fourth Annual Report, acclaimed the news as &quot;a great Moral demonstration of the propriety and necessity of state action!&quot; During the 1850s, the Society also received several thousand dollars from the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Maryland legislatures. Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Mississippi set up their own state societies and colonies on the coast next to Liberia. However, the funds that ACS took in were inadequate to meet the Society&#x27;s stated goals. &quot;For the fourteen years preceding 1834, the receipts of that society, needing millions for its proposed operations, had averaged only about twenty-one thousand dollars a year. It had never obtained the confidence of the American people&quot;.

Three of the reasons the movement never became very successful were lack of interest by free black people, opposition by some abolitionists, and the scale and costs of moving many people (there were 4 million freedmen in the South after the Civil War). There were millions of black slaves in the United States, but colonization only transported a few thousand freedmen.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, the ACS sent a cablegram to President Daniel Howard of Liberia, warning him that any involvement in the war could lead to Liberia&#x27;s territorial integrity being violated regardless of which side might come out on top.

In 1913, and again at its formal dissolution in 1964, the Society donated its records to the U.S. Library of Congress. The donated materials contain a wealth of information about the founding of the society, its role in establishing Liberia, efforts to manage and defend the colony, fundraising, recruitment of settlers, and the way in which black settlers built and led the new nation.

In Liberia, the Society maintained offices at the junction of Ashmun and Buchanan Streets at the heart of Monrovia&#x27;s commercial district, next to the True Whig Party headquarters in the Edward J. Roye Building. Its offices at the site closed in 1956 when the government demolished all the buildings at the intersection for the purpose of constructing new public buildings there. Nevertheless, the land officially remained the property of the Society into the 1980s, amassing large amounts of back taxes because the Ministry of Finance could not find an address to which to send property tax bills.

==Viewed through the perspective of racism==
In the 1950s, racism was an increasingly important issue and by the late 1960s and 1970s, it had been forced to the forefront of public consciousness by the civil rights movement. The prevalence of racism invited a re-evaluation of the Society&#x27;s motives, prompting historians to examine the ACS in terms of racism more than its stance on slavery. By the 1980s and 1990s, historians were going even further in reimagining the ACS. Not only were they focusing on the racist rhetoric of the Society&#x27;s members and publications, but some of them also depicted the Society as a proslavery organization. Recently however, some scholars have stopped depicting the ACS as a proslavery organization, and some of them have characterized it as an antislavery organization again.

<doc id="259154" wikidata="Q5373188" url="?curid=259154" title="Emmanuel College, Gateshead">
<text>Emmanuel College is a secondary school and sixth form college (years 7-13) based in Gateshead, England. It was founded in 1990 as a City Technology College, i.e. a secondary school which is partly funded by donations from business donors who remain involved in management of the college. Emmanuel is currently one of the three remaining City Technology Colleges in England as the remainder have converted to academies. Emmanuel has 1,553 students (340 of which in the sixth form) aged between 11 and 19, and over 160 staff. It is part of Emmanuel Schools Foundation and in each of its four Ofsted inspections it has achieved a status of &quot;Outstanding&quot;.

Students come from a wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds but predominantly from the urban areas within Gateshead and Central and West Newcastle upon Tyne.

==Intake policy==

The college was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2002 as achieving &quot;consistently outstanding academic results&quot;, having received a &quot;glowing&quot; Ofsted report.

By law, the school must admit pupils of mixed ability, according to a normal distribution representative of the whole population. In common with other City Technology Colleges, Emmanuel College uses non-verbal reasoning tests set and marked by the National Foundation for Educational Research, a leading independent research organisation, to assess general intelligence, as opposed to prowess in literacy or mathematics. After marking, the NFER places test results into nine separate categories, and informs the school how many are to be taken from each category.

Another condition is that two-thirds of places are given to students considered to be from the most socio-economically deprived wards within its catchment area, with the other third coming from other areas of the catchment area, ensuring a mix not only academically but socially too.

In terms of Sixth Form admission, a reduced number of places available (130) are offered, with preference to the school&#x27;s own Year 11 students.

==Controversies==

===Creationism===

The school was at the centre of protests from scientists and educationalists when it was revealed that some members of the management team, including both the principal and the head of science, were sympathetic to Young Earth creationism and had allowed its hall to be rented by Answers in Genesis, an organisation which promotes such views. The school includes evolutionary science in its curriculum, but presents evolution as a theory complemented by the theory of creationism (taught in RE lessons). This led to allegations by Richard Dawkins, John Polkinghorne, and others in 2002 that the school taught creationism in science lessons. In 2002, the Liberal Democrat MP Jenny Tonge asked Prime Minister Tony Blair if he was &quot;happy to allow the teaching of creationism alongside Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution in state schools&quot;. Blair replied that he supported a &quot;diverse school system&quot;, and praised the teachers at Emmanuel College for their commitments to &quot;deliver[ing] better results for our children&quot;.

However, after re-inspecting the material used to teach science at Emmanuel College, Ofsted decided that the matter did not need to be pursued further.
The next Ofsted inspection in 2006 described the school as &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; and found no problem with its science provision.

Some allegations centred on the school&#x27;s former head of science, Steven Layfield, who had, prior to his taking up the post, publicly advocated the teaching of Intelligent Design in schools in 2000.

===Gross misconduct allegation===

In the academic year 2013–2014, former teacher of history Mr Daniel McQuoid (son of former principal Nigel McQuoid) engaged in gross misconduct with an 18-year-old student who had left the school; as a result, he resigned in 2014. It was subsequently investigated by both the police and the National College for Teaching and Leadership, which found that there was no evidence of matters serious enough for either police prosecution or for him having any limitations on his ability to teach again.

===Authoritarian ethos===

In 2003, former teacher of music Cormack O&#x27;Duffy painted a negative picture of the college during a discussion with &quot;TES&quot; journalist Michael Shaw. O&#x27;Duffy was discharged of his position for disobeying an order from the then principal Nigel McQuoid for vocally voicing his concerns about the school; however, O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s union provided legal support and the case against him was dropped. During the interview, O&#x27;Duffy described the school as a place of &#x27;eerie silence&#x27; and an institution of immense regulation: &quot;With its quiet atmosphere, you might easily think you had entered the set of a James Bond movie where all the workers at the plant are focused on a task and have no time for frivolity.&quot; Furthermore, O&#x27;Duffy raised concerns about the nature of the Christian ethos claiming an over-emphasis on hell.

==Notable alumni==

<doc id="259159" wikidata="Q1290248" url="?curid=259159" title="William Frawley">
<text>William Clement Frawley (February 26, 1887 – March 3, 1966) was an American vaudevillian and actor best known for playing landlord Fred Mertz in the sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy.&quot; Frawley also played &quot;Bub&quot; O&#x27;Casey during the first five seasons of the sitcom &quot;My Three Sons&quot; and the political advisor to the Hon. Henry X. Harper (Gene Lockhart) in the film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;.

Frawley began his career in Vaudeville in 1914 with his wife, Edna Louise Broedt. Their comedy act, &quot;Frawley and Louise&quot;, continued until their divorce in 1927. He performed on Broadway multiple times. In 1916, he signed with Paramount Studios and appeared in more than 100 films over the next 35 years.

==Early life==
Frawley was born in Burlington, Iowa, the second son in a family of four children to Michael A. Frawley (1857–1907) and Mary E. (Brady) Frawley (1859–1921). He attended Catholic schools and sang in the choir at St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church. As he got older, he played small roles in local theater productions at the Burlington Opera House, and performed in amateur shows, though his mother, a highly religious woman, discouraged such activities.

Frawley&#x27;s first job was as a stenographer in an office of the Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha, Nebraska. Two years later, he moved to Chicago, where he found work as a court reporter, and against his mother&#x27;s wishes, got a singing part in a musical comedy, &quot;The Flirting Princess&quot;. To appease his mother, he relocated to St. Louis, Missouri, to work for another railroad company.

Unfulfilled in his job, he dreamed of becoming a professional entertainer. He formed a vaudeville act with his brother Paul (1889–1973), but six months later, their mother told Paul to return to Iowa. Meanwhile, William wrote a script titled &quot;Fun in a Vaudeville Agency&quot;, and sold it for over $500.

After his initial success as a scriptwriter, Frawley decided to move to the West, settling in Denver, where he was hired as a singer at a café and teamed with pianist Franz Rath. The duo soon moved to San Francisco with their act, &quot;A Man, a Piano, and a Nut&quot;. During his vaudeville career, Frawley introduced and helped popularize the songs &quot;My Mammy&quot;, &quot;My Melancholy Baby&quot;, and &quot;Carolina in the Morning&quot;. Many years later, in 1958, he recorded a selection of his old stage songs on an LP, &quot;Bill Frawley Sings the Old Ones&quot;.

==Early career==

Frawley began performing in Broadway theater. His first such show was the musical comedy, &quot;Merry, Merry&quot; in 1925. Frawley had his first dramatic role in 1932, playing press agent Owen O&#x27;Malley in the original production of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;. He continued to be a dramatic actor at various venues until 1933.

In 1916, Frawley appeared in two short subject silent films. He subsequently performed in three more, but did not decide to develop a cinematic career until 1933, when he appeared in some short comedy films and the feature musical &quot;Moonlight and Pretzels&quot; (Universal Studios, 1933). Frawley moved to Los Angeles, where he signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures.

Finding much work as a character actor, Frawley had roles in comedies, dramas, musicals, Westerns, and romances. He appeared in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947) as Judge Harper&#x27;s (Gene Lockhart) political adviser, who warns his client in great detail of the dire political consequences if he rules that there is no Santa Claus. Some of Frawley&#x27;s other memorable film roles were as the baseball manager in Joe E. Brown&#x27;s &quot;Alibi Ike&quot; (1935), the wedding host in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; (1947), and a hard-nosed insurance investigator in &quot;My Home in San Antone&quot; with Roy Acuff and Lloyd Corrigan. He appeared in two movies starring James Cagney, &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; and &quot;Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye&quot;.

==Television==

===&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;===

By 1951, the 64-year-old Frawley had appeared in over 100 movies, but was starting to find film offers becoming fewer. When he heard that Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting a new television situation comedy, he applied eagerly to play the role of the cantankerous, miserly landlord Fred Mertz. One evening, he telephoned Lucille Ball, asking her what his chances were. Ball was surprised to hear from him, a man she barely knew. Both Ball and Arnaz agreed it would be great to have Frawley, a motion-picture veteran, appear as Fred Mertz. Less enthusiastic were CBS executives, who were wary of Frawley&#x27;s well-known frequent drinking and instability. Arnaz (himself a heavy drinker) warned Frawley about the network&#x27;s concerns, telling him that if he was late to work, arrived drunk, or was unable to perform because of something other than legitimate illness more than once, he would be written out of the show. In one version of this conversation, Arnaz told Frawley he would get three chances. The first screw-up would be tolerated, the second would result in a severe reprimand, and the third would result in his being fired. Contrary to the network&#x27;s concerns, Frawley never arrived at work drunk, and mastered his lines after only one reading. Arnaz eventually became one of Frawley&#x27;s few close friends.

Before each episode, Frawley would read the script with the rest of the cast, then would take out the sheets with only his lines and discard the rest of the script to study only his part.

&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; debuted October 15, 1951, on CBS, and was a huge success. The series was broadcast for six years as half-hour episodes, later changing to hour-long specials from 1957 to 1960 titled &quot;The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show&quot; (later retitled &quot;The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot;).

Vivian Vance played Ethel Mertz, Frawley&#x27;s on-screen wife. Although the two actors worked well together, they greatly disliked each other. Most attribute their mutual hatred to Vance&#x27;s vocal resentment of having to play wife to a man 22 years her senior. Frawley reportedly overheard Vance complaining; he took offense and never forgave her. &quot;She&#x27;s one of the finest girls to come out of Kansas&quot;, he once said, &quot;But I often wish she&#x27;d go back there.&quot;

An avid New York Yankees baseball fan, Frawley had it written into his &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; contract that he did not have to work during the World Series if the Yankees were playing. The Yankees were in every World Series during that time except for 1954 and 1959. He did not appear in two episodes of the show as a result.

For his work on the show, Frawley was Emmy-nominated five consecutive times (1953–1957) for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. In 1957, at the end of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, Ball and Arnaz gave Frawley and Vance the opportunity to have their own &quot;Fred and Ethel&quot; spin-off series for Desilu Studios. Despite his animosity towards her, Frawley saw a lucrative opportunity and accepted. Vance declined, having no desire to work with Frawley again and also feeling that Ethel and Fred would be unsuccessful without the Ricardos.

===&quot;My Three Sons&quot;===

Frawley next joined the cast of the ABC (later CBS) situation comedy &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, playing live-in grandfather and housekeeper Michael Francis &quot;Bub&quot; O&#x27;Casey beginning in 1960. Featuring Fred MacMurray, the series was about a widower raising his three sons.

Frawley reportedly never felt comfortable with the out-of-sequence filming method used for &quot;My Three Sons&quot; after doing &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in sequence for years. Each season was arranged so that main actor Fred MacMurray could film all of his scenes during two separate intensive blocks of filming for a total of 65 working days on the set; Frawley and the other actors worked around the absent MacMurray for the remainder of the year&#x27;s production schedule.

==Personal life==
In 1914, Frawley married fellow vaudevillian Edna Louise Broedt. They developed an act, &quot;Frawley and Louise&quot;, which they performed all across the country. Their act was described as &quot;light comedy, with singing, dancing, and patter.&quot; The couple separated in 1921 (later divorcing in 1927). They had no children. His brother Paul Frawley (1889–1973) also was an actor on Broadway with relatively few appearances in motion pictures.

Frawley had a reputation for being cantankerous and difficult, likely exacerbated by a drinking problem. In 1928, he was fired from the Broadway show &quot;That&#x27;s My Baby&quot; for punching actor Clifton Webb in the nose.

==Final years and death==
Frawley made two television appearances the year before his death. His appearance on the panel show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; on May 3, 1965, consisted of contestants guessing Frawley&#x27;s &quot;secret&quot;, which was that he was the first performer ever to sing &quot;My Melancholy Baby&quot;, in 1912. He had performed that song previously on television, as Fred Mertz, in the 1958 episode &quot;Lucy Goes to Sun Valley&quot; on the &quot;Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot;.

Frawley&#x27;s final on-camera performance was on October 25, 1965, with a brief cameo appearance in Lucille Ball&#x27;s second television sitcom, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, in the episode &quot;Lucy and the Countess Have a Horse Guest&quot;. Frawley plays a horse trainer and Lucy comments: &quot;You know, he reminds me of someone I used to know.&quot; (Vivian Vance, who by then had left &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; except for an occasional guest appearance, does not appear in the episode.)

Frawley suffered a fatal heart attack while walking on Hollywood Boulevard and died on March 3, 1966, five days after his 79th birthday. Upon learning of his death, Desi Arnaz immediately took out a full-page ad in all the trade papers, with the words: &quot;Buenas noches, amigo.&quot; Arnaz, Fred MacMurray, and &quot;My Three Sons&quot; executive producer Don Fedderson were pallbearers at his funeral. Lucille Ball said: &quot;I&#x27;ve lost one of my dearest friends and show business has lost one of the greatest character actors of all time. Those of us who knew him and loved him will miss him.&quot;

===Legacy===
William Frawley is buried in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, Los Angeles. For his achievements in the field of motion pictures, he was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6322 Hollywood Blvd, on February 8, 1960. He is memorialized, as well, in the Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center in Jamestown, New York, which also contains his &quot;Hippity-Hoppity&quot; (frog) costume from an episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Both Frawley and Vivian Vance were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in March 2012.

The story of how Desi Arnaz hired Frawley to play Fred Mertz in &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; is told in &quot;I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom&quot;, a stage comedy that had its world premiere in Los Angeles on July 12, 2018. The play, from Gregg Oppenheimer (son of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; creator-producer-head writer Jess Oppenheimer), was recorded in front of a live audience for nationwide public radio broadcast and online distribution, and starred Sarah Drew as Lucille Ball and Oscar Nunez as Desi Arnaz. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a serialized version of the play in the UK in August 2020, as &quot;Lucy Loves Desi: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom,&quot; in which Stacy Keach portrayed Frawley, Anne Heche played Lucille Ball, and Wilmer Valderrama played Desi Arnaz.

Frawley was portrayed by John Wheeler in the television movie &quot;Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter&quot;. Thirty years later he was portrayed in the 2021 film &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot; by J. K. Simmons, who received an Academy Award nomination for his role.

<text>In England, a City Technology College (CTC) is an urban all-ability specialist school for students aged 11 to 18 specialising in science, technology and mathematics. They charge no fees and are independent of local authority control, being overseen directly by the Department for Education. One fifth of the capital costs are met by private business sponsors, who also own or lease the buildings. The rest of the capital costs, and all running costs, are met by the Department.

== Description ==
CTCs operate as limited companies with articles of association and a board of governors. A CTC is governed through an operating agreement made between the Secretary of State for Education and whoever is responsible for establishing and running the school. This agreement includes the regulations for the school&#x27;s educational provision (e.g. its curriculum and admissions policy). These are negotiated between the two parties and must be enforced by the school should it wish to receive government funding from the Secretary of State. This funding covers most capital costs and all running costs, although one fifth of capital costs are instead met by private business sponsors, who also own or lease the buildings. More government funding is granted to be spent towards the school&#x27;s pupils. This funding fluctuates on a per capita basis and depends on the size of the total pupil population.

CTCs teach the National Curriculum, but specialise in mainly technology-based subjects such as technology, science and mathematics.
Like maintained schools, they are regularly inspected by the Office for Standards in Education. CTCs also forge close links with businesses and industry (mainly through their sponsors), and often their governors are directors of local or national businesses that are supporting or have supported the colleges. The programme has been successful in the long term with all the CTCs being considered strong establishments with consistently high academic results.

== Development ==
Plans to establish schools or colleges for technology in major urban areas were first reported in an article from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in December 1985. There would be between sixteen and twenty of these institutions serving 1000 pupils each. They would charge no fees and would be publicly funded through an educational trust, but would select their pupils on a &quot;special&quot; basis. Unlike other state-funded schools at this time, these institutions would not be run by their local education authority (LEA or simply local authority). These plans were the brainchild of Schools Minister Bob Dunn, who had been pushing the Secretary of State for Education and Science Keith Joseph to introduce British magnet schools, with the ultimate aim of encouraging specialisation and increased parental choice in the education system. These schools, if introduced, would be known as technology-plus schools, specialist schools for technology with extra funding from private sector sponsors.

In January 1986, a Centre for Policy Studies meeting was held in the House of Lords. The meeting was organised by Cyril Taylor and focused on the growing issue of unemployment amongst the youth. Among the attendees were Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Secretary of State for Employment David Young, who chaired the meeting, and sixty other business leaders and politicians, twenty of whom were invited by Taylor. The twenty business leaders explained to Thatcher that the cause of youth unemployment was schools teaching the wrong skills to their pupils. They recommended, with Taylor, the creation of a hundred secondary schools similar to Bob Dunn&#x27;s proposed technology-plus schools to deal with this issue. They would be urban inner city specialist schools for technological and technical education, funded by the central government via direct grant legislation and independent of local authority control, instead being partially controlled by private sector sponsors investing into them. Taylor thought that these schools could meet the growing demands for business qualifications in the workforce and also proposed a new provision for teacher training in these schools to combat the ongoing teacher shortage at the time.

A new Secretary of State for Education and Science, Kenneth Baker, was appointed on 21 May 1986. An advocate of technical education and technology in general, Baker was drawn towards the concept of schools for information technology, having formed this interest during his tenure as the Minister for Industry and Information Technology in the early 1980s. Computers were a rarity in schools at the time, so Baker set up an initiative to introduce a computer to every school in the country. Now in his position as Education Secretary, Baker wished to further improve digital learning and computing in the education system, and wanted to introduce schools for computing and information technology as a way to do so. In addition, schools for general technology were expected to give pupils the correct skills for employment, which supported the recommendations made some months prior by Cyril Taylor and his business leaders.

The policy for the schools proposed in January&#x27;s meeting, dubbed City Technology Colleges or simply CTCs, was developed in the five months following Baker&#x27;s appointment. This was influenced from talks surrounding other proposed technical schools, namely the technology-plus schools proposed by Bob Dunn, which occurred at the same time. Like CTCs, Dunn&#x27;s technology-plus schools would be inner city specialist schools for technology with independence from their local authorities with some involvement from industry sponsors. Baker and Dunn worked together to develop the CTC policy, with the help of six other main individuals. They were Chris Patten, Cyril Taylor, George Walden, Virginia Bottomley, Alistair Burt and Tony Kerpel, all of whom served as ministers or advisers to Baker and his predecessor at the Department for Education and Science, Keith Joseph. The schools&#x27; independence from local authority control attracted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her policy adviser Brian Griffiths, both of whom wanted local authorities phased out of the education system. Thatcher supported the policy on these grounds, alongside the belief that it would improve education and give schools increased autonomy from their local authorities.

== Implementation ==
Finally, Baker announced the City Technology Colleges programme at the 1986 Conservative Party Conference, which had a goal of creating a national network of new CTCs that would boost educational diversity and parental choice in the school system, while also improving educational standards in their local areas. As expected, around twenty of these new schools were planned for creation in urban inner cities next to secondary schools already in operation, and all of them would have total independence from their LEA. They would serve pupils aged from eleven to eighteen, selecting them based on their &quot;attitudes&quot; towards a technological education. Despite this, the schools would not use an eleven-plus exam as was customary in other selective schools, and would be classified as comprehensive schools. They would specialise in science, technology and mathematics and have a strong provision for information technology and vocational education.

The first CTCs opened under the terms of the Education Reform Act 1988 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The first City Technology College opened was The City Technology College, Kingshurst in 1988, which was later converted to an academy in 2008.
The original intention was to improve education inside cities, but the programme was hampered by the refusal of local authorities in the targeted areas to provide suitable school sites.
Building entirely new schools was much more expensive, requiring a greater contribution from the government, and the resulting schools tended to be on the outskirts of cities.
After the programme was abandoned, the government embarked on the more modest aim of designating some existing schools as Technology Colleges, the first non-CTC specialist schools.

The Learning and Skills Act 2000 introduced a similar type of school, the City Academy, later renamed Academy.
Differences from CTCs include halving the financial commitment of the sponsor, and being bound by the Schools Admissions Code.
The Labour government encouraged CTCs to convert into academies.

== List of CTCs ==
=== Established ===
In all, 15 City Technology Colleges were created, of which all but three have converted to academies:
=== Proposed ===
Although there were only 15 City Technology Colleges by the end of the programme, there were a number of additional proposed CTCs that never opened:
