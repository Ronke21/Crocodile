<text>The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is a public research university in Sha Tin, New Territories, Hong Kong.

Established in 1963 as a federation of three collegesChung Chi College, New Asia College, and United College, it is Hong Kong&#x27;s second-oldest university, with the first being the University of Hong Kong. Predecessors of the university included St. John&#x27;s University, Lingnan University and Yenching University, alongside 10 other Christian universities in China.

The university is organised into nine constituent colleges and eight academic faculties, and remains the only collegiate university in Hong Kong. The university operates in both English and Chinese.

Four Nobel laureates are associated with the university, and it is the only tertiary institution in Hong Kong with recipients of the Nobel Prize, Turing Award, Fields Medal, and Veblen Prize sitting as faculty in residence. 

==History==
===Origins===
The university was formed in 1963 as a federation of three existing colleges. The first of these, New Asia College, was established in 1949 by anti-Communist Confucian scholars from mainland China amid the Chinese Communist Revolution there. Among the founders were Ch&#x27;ien Mu, Tang Junyi, and Tchang Pi-kai. The college&#x27;s curriculum focused particularly on Chinese heritage and social concerns. The early years of this school were tumultuous, with the campus relocating several times between rented premises around Kowloon. Academics there were often self-exiled from the mainland and struggled financially, with students sometimes sleeping on rooftops and teachers forgoing pay to sustain the college. Funds were gradually raised and the school moved to a new campus in Kau Pui Lung, built with the support of the Ford Foundation, in 1956.

Following the Communist revolution in China and the breakdown in relations between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the United States with the 1950 outbreak of the Korean War, all Christian colleges and universities in China were shut down. Chung Chi College was founded in 1951 by Protestant churches in Hong Kong to continue the theological education of mainland churches and schools. The 63 students in its first year of operations were taught in various churches and rented premises on Hong Kong Island. The college moved to its present location in Ma Liu Shui (i.e., the present CUHK campus) in 1956. By 1962, a year before the founding of CUHK, Chung Chi had 531 students in 10 departments taught by a full-time faculty of 40 (excluding tutors).

United College was founded in 1956 with the merging of five private colleges in the Guangdong province: Canton Overseas, Kwang Hsia, Wah Kiu, Wen Hua, and Ping Jing College of Accountancy. The first school president was F.I. Tseung. The original campus on Caine Road on Hong Kong Island accommodated over 600 students.

In 1957, New Asia College, Chung Chi College, and United College came together to establish the Chinese Colleges Joint Council.

===Foundation===
In June 1959, the Hong Kong government expressed its intent in establishing a new university with Chinese as the medium of instruction. The same year, the Post-Secondary Colleges Ordinance was announced to provide government funding and official recognition to New Asia, Chung Chi, and United colleges in hopes that the money would &quot;enable them to raise their standards to a level at which they might qualify for university status, probably on a federal basis&quot;. The ordinance was enacted on 19 May 1960.

The Chinese University Preparatory Committee was established in June 1961 to advise the government on possible sites for the new university. The following May, the Fulton Commission was formed to assess the suitability of the three government-funded post-secondary colleges to become constituent colleges of the new university. The commission, headed by Vice-Chancellor John Fulton of the newly-established University of Sussex, visited Hong Kong over the summer and produced an interim report recommending the establishment of the federal university comprising the three colleges.

The Fulton Commission report was tabled in the Legislative Council in June 1963, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong Ordinance was passed in September of that year. The school was officially inaugurated in a ceremony at the City Hall on 17 October 1963, officiated by the founding chancellor, Sir Robert Brown Black. The next year, Li Choh-ming was appointed the first vice-chancellor of the university. The university originally consisted of the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Science, and the Faculty of Social Science. Construction began at the site of the new campus in the Ma Liu Shui area, where Chung Chi College was already established, for new facilities to house central administration and the relocated New Asia and United colleges.

===1963–present===

Construction of the new campus continued throughout the 1960s to a development plan produced by W. Szeto and Partners. Above the valley occupied by Chung Chi College, on two plateaux formed by granite quarrying for the Plover Cove dam, the quarters for the other two colleges would flank the Central Campus housing administrative buildings and other shared facilities. Some of the most iconic buildings on campus, like the University Library, were built in this period along the monumental axis of the University Mall in the subdued concrete aesthetic for which the school is known. The School of Education, which would later become a faculty, was founded in 1965. The Graduate School, the first in Hong Kong, was founded in 1966 and the first batch of master&#x27;s degrees were awarded the following year.

In the early 1970s, New Asia and United Colleges moved into their new premises on the highest plateau of the campus. The Student Union was established in 1971, as &quot;The Student Union of The Chinese University of Hong Kong&quot; (香港中文大學學生會)(CUSU). The School of Medicine was founded in 1977 and its teaching hospital, the Prince of Wales Hospital in nearby Sha Tin New Town, was established years later in 1984.

The university constitution was also reviewed in the 1970s with an aim to assessing the school&#x27;s growth and charting its future. In 1975, the chancellor appointed an external commission, again chaired by John Fulton, to review the university constitution. Aside from Fulton, the commission comprised I.C.M. Maxwell (its secretary), Sir Michael Herries, and C.K. Yang. The commission held five days of filmed hearings to garner comments from stakeholders. This second Fulton Report recommended that academic policy, finances, matriculation of students, appointment of staff, curriculum, examinations, and the awarding of degrees fall under the purview of the university administration. Buildings would also be maintained by the university regardless of which college owned them. The colleges would be entrusted with small group &quot;student-oriented teaching&quot;. Rationalisation was suggested to reduce duplication of efforts among the different colleges. 

The federal structure of the university would thus be replaced by something closer to that of a unitary university. This was controversial among the colleges. The Board of Governors of New Asia College flatly rejected the recommendations of the report, alleging that it would destroy the collegiate system, turning the colleges into &quot;empty shells&quot;. Dr. Denny Huang, a longtime member of the Board of Governors of Chung Chi College, criticised the effort to centralise powers and stated that the college governorship would be reduced to &quot;nothing more than managers of an estate&quot;. The Fulton Report recommendations were packaged into the Chinese University of Hong Kong Bill 1976. In defence of the bill the acting Secretary for Social Services, M.C. Morgan, said that &quot;a situation with each college developing into a little university of its own was not compatible with the sensible evolution of a modern major seat of higher learning&quot;. The changes recommended by the report came into effect in December 1976.

The first non-founding college, Shaw College, was named after its patron, Sir Run Run Shaw, who donated five hundred million Hong Kong dollars toward its establishment in May 1985. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Declaration of Shaw College) Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council in July 1986, and the fourth college was officially opened in March 1990 by Sir Run Run Shaw and Governor David Wilson.

The 1990s brought about another building boom. The original Chung Chi teaching and administration blocks were demolished and replaced with much larger and modern structures in several phases over the course of a decade. The Ho Sin-Hang engineering block opened in 1994 to house the new School of Engineering. In 1994, the school transitioned to the British-style three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree system. The Hong Kong Internet Exchange, a metropolitan network backbone, was founded in 1995 and remains an internet hub for the region.

In the 2000s, the university underwent another period of expansion, in part to accommodate increased student numbers brought about by the 334 Scheme. Five new colleges came into operation: Morningside College and S. H. Ho College were announced in 2006, and were followed in 2007 by C. W. Chu College, Wu Yee Sun College and Lee Woo Sing College. These colleges are smaller in scale than the older ones, each comprising only one or two blocks rather than an entire section of campus and housing fewer students, but they nonetheless each contain the usual array of facilities like student hostels, amenities and communal dining halls. New teaching blocks and a student amenity centre were also opened near the railway station.

====Goddess of Democracy====
On 29 May 2010, when the CUHK student union sought to permanently locate a &#x27;Goddess of Democracy&#x27; statue on campus, the administrative and planning committee of the university convened an emergency meeting for 1 June, chaired by incumbent vice-chancellor Lawrence Lau, to consider the request. The application was turned down; the reason provided was the need for the university to maintain political neutrality. Staff and students objected to the refusal, however, accusing the committee of self-censorship; students declared they were prepared for a stand-off against the university, saying they would ensure the statues were accommodated on campus &quot;at all costs&quot;.

A student meeting was convened, and student union President Eric Lai told 2,000 attendees that the university officials should apologise for their opposition of the art display. On 4 June, bowing to public outcry and student pressure, the university relented, and allowed the statue on campus.

Vice-chancellor-designate Joseph Sung, who was consulted on the vote &quot;in absentia&quot;, admitted that it was the biggest political storm in 21 years. He revealed that, in addition to preserving political neutrality, safety and security concerns were factors in the decision. He also drew a distinction between this application – for a permanent University installation – and hypothetical applications for short-term expressions of free speech, suggesting the latter would have been more likely to be approved, but he criticised the management team as &quot;immature&quot; and &quot;inexperienced&quot; in handling the incident.

An editorial in &quot;The Standard&quot; criticised the committee&#x27;s naivety in not anticipating the reaction. It was also highly critical of Sung for seeking to distance himself from the decision with such a &quot;lame excuse&quot;. Outgoing vice-chancellor Lawrence Lau defended the committee&#x27;s decision as &quot;collective and unanimous&quot; after &quot;detailed consideration,&quot; citing the unanimous vote of the administrative and planning committee, and he disagreed with Sung&#x27;s characterisation of the management team. While the vote was unanimous, however, Sung stated that he had suggested the wording of the decision include the qualification that the committee &quot;had not reached a consensus.&quot;

The student union said the two professors should have communicated to reach a consensus, and that Lau&#x27;s reply &quot;failed to explain why the school used political neutrality as a reason to reject the statue.&quot;

====2019 protest conflict====

During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, the campus became the site of a series of clashes between protesters and the police. Students and protesters disrupted traffic near the university, including the Tolo Harbour Highway, to facilitate a Hong Kong-wide general strike on 11 November 2019. On 12 November, riot police entered the campus to disperse the protestors, firing 1,567 tear gas rounds, 380 bean bag rounds and 1,312 rubber bullets while protesters built barricades, threw bricks and petrol bombs. Vice-chancellor Rocky Tuan tried to seek mediation with the police, which was rejected. It resulted in a two-day siege of the university by the police from 13 to 15 November. Most protesters left the campus by 15 November, with at least 70 students being injured. Protestors barricaded most entrances and exits, leading to a campus-wide traffic disruption. The increasing violence led to the University Senate voting to cancel the ongoing semester, followed by a university-wide evacuation. Mainland students were evacuated from the school by the Marine Police by marine vessels upon their request.

==Administration and organisation==

===Governance===
Prior to Hong Kong&#x27;s handover, the colony&#x27;s governor was the &quot;de jure&quot; chancellor of the university. That role was assumed by the territory&#x27;s chief executive following the handover. For a list of pre- and post-handover university chancellors, refer to the articles for the governor of Hong Kong and the chief executive of Hong Kong.

===Administration===

==== President and vice-chancellor ====
The president/vice-chancellor is under the council of the university, followed by the pro-vice-chancellor/vice-president. There are nine colleges and eight faculties, each of which has its own dean/head.

=== Organisation ===
CUHK is a comprehensive research university with most departments and schools organised into eight faculties, namely the Faculties of Arts, Business Administration, Education, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, and Social Science, along with a graduate school which administers all the postgraduate programmes provided by different academic units. Moreover, associate School of Continuing and Professional Studies (CUSCS) offers associate degree and higher diploma programmes.

===Funding===
In 2005, the university budget was HK$4,558 million, with government subvention of about HK$2,830 million. In the 2018–19 fiscal year (starts 1 April), total income was increased to $9,624 million while government subvention had risen to $5,121 million, about 53.2% of the total budget.

==Academics==
===Teaching and learning===
CUHK currently adopts a strategic plan in five fields of academic inquiry: Biomedical Sciences, Chinese Studies, Economics &amp; Finance, Geoinformation &amp; Earth Sciences and Information Sciences. Despite the stipulation of using Chinese language as the principal medium in the university&#x27;s ordinance, CUHK has emphasised the importance of both English and Chinese. 

===Research===

The Yale-China Chinese Language Centre (CLC), formerly New Asia – Yale-in-China Chinese Language Center, was founded in 1963 under the joint auspices of New Asia College and the Yale-China Association. The centre became part of Chinese University in 1974 and has been responsible for the teaching of one language education (Putonghua and Cantonese) of university students as well as other Putonghua and Cantonese learners. Courses are offered for non-native speakers and for native speakers of Chinese. Programmes are divided into Putonghua courses for local students, Cantonese courses for mainland Chinese Students and Putonghua and Cantonese courses for non-native Chinese speakers.

The university also hosts several research centres. The Childhood Bilingualism Research Centre (CBRC) is part of the Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages. Research at the centre includes documenting the development of bilingualism in bilingual children and assessing the bilingual competence they gain in childhood; raising the public&#x27;s awareness of Hong Kong children&#x27;s development of biliteracy and trilingualism; and studying and supporting the revitalisation of minority languages in the context of bilingual and multilingual education. The centre is directed by Professor Virginia Yip and Professor Stephen Matthews.

The Universities Service Centre for China Studies (USC), founded in 1963 as &quot;The Universities Service Center,&quot; was renamed and moved from Kowloon to the campus in 1988.
Its mission is to support the study of contemporary China and Hong Kong, especially among mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, and international scholars. The centre houses a major collection of mainland newspapers, periodicals, and official publications.

===Libraries and museums===
The University Library System (ULS) comprises seven different libraries and several special collections. The largest library is the University Library at the Central Campus, which recently underwent a significant renovation and building expansion. The other six libraries are the Elisabeth Luce Moore Library, Ch’ien Mu Library, Wu Chung Library, Architecture Library, Li Ping Medical Library, and Lee Quo Wei Law Library.

Among the collections housed by ULS includes the Hong Kong Studies Archive, Hong Kong Literature Collection, Chinese Overseas Collection, Nobel Laureate GAO, Xingjian Collection, Nobel Laureate CY Yang Archive, American Studies Resource Collection and Modern Chinese Drama Collection.

CUHK also houses the Chinese University of Hong Kong Art Museum, which houses &quot;a wide range of artefacts illuminating the rich arts, humanities and cultural heritage of ancient and pre-modern China.&quot;

A new Museum of Climate Change, the first such museum in Hong Kong, opened in December 2013 in the Yasumoto International Academic Park building. Funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the 100 exhibits on display illustrate the effects of climate change. The museum is open to the public free of charge. Also in 2013, the University Gallery opened in the central library to showcase the history of the school in light of its Golden Jubilee anniversary.

== Reputation and rankings ==
CUHK has been consistently regarded as one of the top two universities in Hong Kong by various university rankings, with the other being the University of Hong Kong.

=== Overall rankings ===
CUHK was ranked #47 worldwide in QS WUR 2024, #53 worldwide in THE WUR 2024, and #53 worldwide in US News &amp; Report 2022–2023, and #101-150 worldwide in ARWU 2021. CUHK has been the top Hong Kong institution in the ARWU, which is based on awards and research output, including those league tables in 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2013. The HKU Public Opinion Programme survey (2012) gave it the 2nd place. China&#x27;s Alumni Association placed it among the &quot;6-Star Greater China&#x27;s Universities&quot; (the highest level). It was ranked fourth in the association&#x27;s 2014 Ranking of Institutions with the Most Best Disciplines in HK, Macau and Taiwan.

CUHK was 65th worldwide in terms of aggregate performance across THE, QS, and ARWU, as reported by ARTU 2023.

=== Subject/Area rankings ===
Besides overall rankings, a list of subject rankings of Hong Kong tertiary institutions is available to show the strength of its individual disciplines ranked by the above organisations. CUHK business school was ranked 17th in the Financial Times EMBA rankings, and its MBA programme was placed 27th worldwide in the Global MBA Rankings (2013) and 94th in the Economist&#x27;s 2012 ranking.

CUHK received eight Higher Education Outstanding Scientific Research Output Awards (Science and Technology) from mainland China&#x27;s Ministry of Education (MoE) in 2014, including two first-class awards and five second-class awards in Natural Sciences, making it the institution receiving the highest number of awards among Hong Kong tertiary institutions.

Despite a short history of 43 years as of 2024, CUHK&#x27;s medical school was ranked as world&#x27;s #49 in 2014, #47 in 2016, and #28 in 2024 in QS ranking. It has built abundant specialty research centres and hailed constant research innovations by its faculty. The medical school curriculum also places a heavy emphasis on bioethics and humanity in medicine and has built this course track in collaboration with Columbia University. The university&#x27;s non-profit private teaching hospital, CUHK Medical Centre, opened in 2021.

==Student life==
===School environment===

CUHK possesses the largest and greenest campus of all higher education institutions in Hong Kong. The hilly campus hosts facilities such as libraries, art museums, music halls, a swimming pool, sports fields, tennis courts, squash courts, a water sports centre, and gymnasiums. Many points (e.g. the Pavilion of Harmony) around the campus offer attractive views of Tide Cove and the Tolo Harbour.

The university has two full-size sports grounds with running tracks: the Sir Philip Haddon-Cave Sports Field and the Lingnan Stadium. The Olympic-size swimming pool at the Benjamin Franklin Centre was completed in 1973; its opening ceremony was held in October 1974 and hosted by Charles T. Cross. The university&#x27;s Water Sports Centre, on the shore of Tide Cove, offers facilities and equipment hire for sailing, rowing, and windsurfing.

Most of CUHK&#x27;s campus is located within Sha Tin District, though small parts of it are in Tai Po District.

===Collegiate system===

As a collegiate university, the school consists of nine colleges that differ in character and history, each retaining substantial autonomy on institutional affairs: Chung Chi College, New Asia College, United College, Shaw College, Morningside College, S. H. Ho College, Lee Woo Sing College, Wu Yee Sun College and C. W. Chu College. All undergraduates are affiliated to one of them.

Colleges are designed as communities with their own hostels, dining halls, and other facilities. Students receive pastoral care and whole-person education, including formal and non-formal general education by means of close interaction with teachers and peers, and in some colleges, assemblies and final-year projects. Colleges promote extracurricular social and athletic activities with an aim of building camaraderie among students. This focus on &#x27;student orientated teaching&#x27;education through both formal teaching and student empowermentdistinguishes CUHK from other universities in the territory.

When the structure of the university was revamped in 1976, and the autonomy of the colleges diminished, John Fulton clarified the role of the colleges: &quot;the natural home of student-oriented teaching is the college [which] is an association of senior and junior members come together in pursuit of shared academic interests and aims.&quot; He wrote that the colleges help students achieve &quot;a sense of his or her personal significance and responsibility, and on that basis to enrich the common life.&quot;

===Transportation===

Access to the campus is convenient despite being located away from the metropolitan areas of Hong Kong. The university is accessible by the University station of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) and by multiple bus routes. Bus and railway stations are located beside Chung Chi College, with additional bus stops just outside the two school entrances on Tai Po Road. The new exit D of the MTR University station was opened in September 2012 to cope with the new students from the 3-3-4 education system. 

A system of shuttle bus routes, operated by the university&#x27;s Transport Office, runs between the MTR station, academic buildings, and residences. Shuttle buses are free for students and staff, and are intended for the use of students and staff only. Despite this, many visitors still use the shuttle buses for their own conveniences. Alongside the free shuttle bus service, paid shuttle light bus is also available operating from Monday to Saturday. 

The topography of the campus, as well as a layout confusing to newcomers, may deter many from walking around campus. Many buildings on campus incorporate lifts and bridges designed to provide shortcuts in ascending the hill. The latest campus master plan has recognised this strategy as desirable and proposes the development of new walking routes to reduce reliance on the campus bus system.

==Notable people==

, four Nobel Prize laureates are associated with the university, namely Chen Ning Yang, James Mirrlees, Robert Alexander Mundell, and the university&#x27;s former vice-chancellor and president, Sir Charles K. Kao.

Other notable faculty members include mathematician Shing-Tung Yau, laureate of the Fields Medal and the Veblen Prize, computational theorist Andrew Yao, laureate of the Turing Award, and surgeon James Ware, who was a leading figure in the then emerging field of medical education.

== CUHK–Shenzhen ==

In 2014, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK–Shenzhen) was officially founded in Shenzhen, a city of Guangdong Province on the southern coast of mainland China near Hong Kong. According to CUHK, its campus in Sha Tin and CUHK–Shenzhen are &quot;one brand, two campuses&quot;, and are supervised by the same Senate. Graduates from CUHK–Shenzhen are awarded degrees of CUHK, the same as those awarded to CUHK graduates (but denoting &quot;Shenzhen&quot; in the main text), as well as a graduation certificate approved by the Ministry of Education and conferred by CUHK–Shenzhen.

<text>Boyd Gaming Corporation is an American gaming and hospitality company based in Paradise, Nevada. The company continues to be run by founder Sam Boyd&#x27;s family under the management of Sam&#x27;s granddaughter, Marianne Boyd-Johnson, who currently serves as the company&#x27;s executive chairman after her father, Bill, was appointed Chairman Emeritus in May 2023.

As of 2021, Boyd operates 28 properties with a total of 10,751 hotel rooms and of casino space with 31,635 slot machines and 686 table games. Gaming revenue is 80% of total gross revenue.

==History==
Boyd Gaming&#x27;s history dates to 1941, when founder Sam Boyd first arrived in Las Vegas with his family. After being hired as a dealer, Sam Boyd worked his way up through the ranks of the Las Vegas casino industry, first to pit boss, then shift boss. He eventually saved enough to buy a small interest in the Sahara Hotel and Casino; later, Sam Boyd left the Sahara to become general manager and partner of The Mint Las Vegas.

Sam Boyd first partnered with his son Bill in 1962, when the two teamed up to acquire the Eldorado Casino in Henderson, Nevada. Bill, who was then a practicing attorney, acquired his first stake in the Eldorado by doing its legal work. Sam would go on to manage the Eldorado full-time after the Mint was sold in 1968.


Although the Boyd family had been involved in the Las Vegas casino industry for decades, Boyd Gaming Corporation wasn&#x27;t founded until January 1, 1975, when the company was formed to develop and operate the California Hotel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas. Then known as the Boyd Group, the company initially had 75 investors.

Boyd Gaming embarked on its first expansion in 1979, when it opened the first Sam&#x27;s Town Hotel and Gambling Hall-branded property; Sam&#x27;s Town Las Vegas on Boulder Highway at Nellis Boulevard. Considered one of the first &quot;locals&quot; properties in the Las Vegas Valley, Sam&#x27;s Town helped inaugurate the later development of Las Vegas&#x27; &quot;Boulder Strip.&quot;

During these first two decades in operation, Sam and Bill Boyd developed a reputation for running a squeaky-clean operation. As a result, Nevada regulators turned to the Boyds for help following an investigation of skimming operations at the Stardust and Fremont casinos in the mid-1980s. The properties were notorious at the time for their extensive skimming operations; according to the FBI, anywhere from $7 million to $15 million in funds from the Stardust were diverted to organized crime figures between 1974 and 1976 alone.

In 1984, after leveling a $3 million fine against the Stardust for skimming, the Nevada Gaming Commission asked the Boyds to run the property&#x27;s gaming operations. When the Stardust was taken over by the reputable Boyd family, they were surprised by its huge profits, now that every penny of income was being recorded. Ex-FBI agent William F. Roemer Jr., longtime senior agent of the FBI&#x27;s organized-crime squad in Chicago and an expert in Las Vegas doings, said, &quot;The amount of skim had been so heavy that the profit and loss statement did not present a true picture of the gold mine that the Stardust was.&quot; After several years of successful operations, Boyd Gaming officially acquired the Stardust and Fremont in 1985.

Company founder Sam Boyd died on January 15, 1993, at the age of 82, and was succeeded as chief executive officer by Bill Boyd. In July of the same year, Boyd Gaming held its initial public offering of stock, debuting on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol &quot;BYD.&quot;

Funds from the IPO supplied Boyd Gaming with a source of capital for expansion, and the company embarked on a period of aggressive growth. The company acquired the Eldorado and Jokers Wild (which had previously been owned directly by the Boyd family) in 1993; later that year, Boyd Gaming acquired the bankrupt Main Street Station Hotel and Casino and Brewery.

The company&#x27;s first expansion outside of Nevada came in 1994, when Boyd Gaming opened Sam&#x27;s Town Tunica in Mississippi. Later expansions included:

* Silver Star Hotel and Casino, owned by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (opened in 1994; management contract expired in 2000);
* Treasure Chest Casino in Kenner, Louisiana (Boyd owned 15% of the property at its 1994 opening, before acquiring Treasure Chest outright in 1997);
* Sam&#x27;s Town Kansas City (opened 1995, closed 1998);
* Par-A-Dice Hotel and Casino in East Peoria, Illinois. (acquired in 1996);
* Blue Chip Casino, Hotel and Spa in Michigan City, Indiana. (acquired in 1999);
* Delta Downs Racetrack Casino &amp; Hotel, Vinton, Louisiana (acquired in 2001);
* Sam&#x27;s Town Shreveport (formerly Harrah&#x27;s Shreveport; acquired from Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment in 2004).

Boyd Gaming&#x27;s most ambitious expansion project came in 2003, when the company opened the $1.1 billion Borgata Hotel Casino in Atlantic City, N.J. A joint venture with MGM Resorts International, Borgata was the first new casino property to open in Atlantic City in 13 years, and quickly emerged as the market&#x27;s leading property by gaming revenue. Borgata is by far Boyd Gaming&#x27;s largest property, and currently supplies more than a third of the company&#x27;s overall profits.

Less than a year after Borgata opened, Boyd Gaming announced plans to acquire Coast Casinos, Inc., one of the largest operators of locals casinos in the Las Vegas market. Completed on July 1, 2004, the $1.3 billion acquisition gave Boyd Gaming four additional Las Vegas properties—Suncoast; Gold Coast; the Orleans; and Barbary Coast.

The Coast acquisition also included the yet-to-be completed South Coast, located five miles (8 km) south of the Strip on Las Vegas Boulevard. Boyd Gaming completed the project and opened its doors on December 22, 2005 Boyd Gaming operated the property for less than a year before selling it to former Coast CEO Michael Gaughan in 2006. (The property was rebranded to its current name, South Point, following the sale to Gaughan.)

In 2006, Boyd Gaming turned its focus to what would have been the largest project in its history: Echelon, a $4.8 billion resort complex at the site of the Stardust. In preparation for the project, Boyd Gaming swapped the Barbary Coast to Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment in exchange for 24 acres near the Stardust, giving the company an 87-acre parcel on the north end of the Strip. The famed Stardust was closed on November 1, 2006, and imploded the night of March 13, 2007.

Construction on Echelon Place began on June 19, 2007, with plans to open in 2010, but was suspended a little over one year later, on August 1, 2008. At the time, Boyd Gaming officials cited &quot;the difficult environment in today&#x27;s capital markets, as well as weak economic conditions,&quot; and estimated construction would resume in three to four quarters. As the global recession deepened, the suspension continued; in October 2009, the company said it would likely be three to five years before development resumed. However, in March 2013, Boyd sold the Echelon site for $350 million to the Genting Group, a Malaysia-based gaming company to develop the site as Resorts World Las Vegas.

In 2007, Boyd purchased Dania Jai Alai, a fronton in Dania Beach, Florida. The company hoped to expand the facility with a casino, but efforts to allow new casinos in the Miami area made little headway. Boyd agreed in 2011 to sell the property to Dania Entertainment for $80 million, but the deal was not completed. The two companies reached a new sale agreement in February 2013 for $65.5 million.

Boyd Gaming bought the IP Casino Resort &amp; Spa in October 2011 for $278 million cash, plus a $10 million donation to the Engelstad Family Foundation.

In November 2012, Boyd acquired Peninsula Gaming, an Iowa-based company with five casinos in the Midwest and South, for $1.45 billion.

The company made two deals in 2016 to expand its footprint in the Vegas locals market, acquiring the Aliante Casino and Hotel for $380 million and the two properties of Cannery Casino Resorts for $230 million. Meanwhile, it sold its 50 percent stake in the Borgata to MGM for $900 million.

In July 2018, Boyd announced a partnership with MGM Resorts International &quot;to significantly increase each company&#x27;s market access and customer base throughout the United States.&quot; The partnership is focused on positioning both companies to succeed in the emerging online gambling and sports betting markets in the United States.

In late 2018, Boyd completed two deals to increase its regional holdings. It acquired Valley Forge Casino Resort in Pennsylvania for $281 million. It also purchased the operations of four casinos from Pinnacle Entertainment for $564 million: Ameristar Kansas City, Ameristar St. Charles, Belterra Casino, and Belterra Park. The company paid another $58 million for the real estate of Belterra Park. The sale was designed to ensure regulatory approval for Penn National Gaming&#x27;s planned purchase of Pinnacle.

On July 13, 2020, Boyd Gaming announced it was laying off at least 25% of its workforce equating to thousands of job losses at its properties nationwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

In March 2022, Boyd Gaming entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pala Interactive LLC and its subsidiaries for total cash consideration of $170 million. In November 2022, it was announced the deal had been completed. Pala Interactive LLC is an interactive online gaming company, majority owned by the Pala Band of Mission Indians.

<doc id="268973" wikidata="Q16155171" url="?curid=268973" title="Scale (social sciences)">
<text>In the social sciences, scaling is the process of measuring or ordering entities with respect to quantitative attributes or traits. For example, a scaling technique might involve estimating individuals&#x27; levels of extraversion, or the perceived quality of products. Certain methods of scaling permit estimation of magnitudes on a continuum, while other methods provide only for relative ordering of the entities.

The level of measurement is the type of data that is measured.

The word scale, including in academic literature, is sometimes used to refer to another composite measure, that of an index. Those concepts are however different.

==Scale construction decisions==

*What level (level of measurement) of data is involved (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio)?

*What will the results be used for?
*What should be used - a scale, index, or typology?

*What types of statistical analysis would be useful?
*Choose to use a comparative scale or a non-comparative scale.
*How many scale divisions or categories should be used (1 to 10; 1 to 7; −3 to +3)?
*Should there be an odd or even number of divisions? (Odd gives neutral center value; even forces respondents to take a non-neutral position.)
*What should the nature and descriptiveness of the scale labels be?
*What should the physical form or layout of the scale be? (graphic, simple linear, vertical, horizontal)
*Should a response be forced or be left optional?

==Scale construction method==

Scales constructed should be representative of the construct that it intends to measure. It is possible that something similar to the scale a person intends to create will already exist, so including those scale(s) and possible dependent variables in one&#x27;s survey may increase validity of one&#x27;s scale.

#Begin by generating at least ten items to represent each of the sub-scales. Administer the survey; the more representative and larger the sample, the more credibility one will have in the scales.
#Review the means and standard deviations for the items, dropping any items with skewed means or very low variance.
#Run an exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation on items for the scales - it is important to differentiate them based on their loading on factors to create sub-scales that represents the construct. Request factors with eigenvalues (for calculating eigenvalue for each factor square the factor loading&#x27;s and sum down the columns) greater than 1. It is easier to group the items by targeted scales. The more distinct the other items, the better the chances the items will load better in one&#x27;s own scale.
#“Cleanly loaded items” are those items that load at least .40 on one factor and more than .10 greater on that factor than on any others. Identify those in the factor pattern.
#“Cross loaded items” are those that do not meet the above criterion. These are candidates to drop.
#Identify factors with only a few items that do not represent clear concepts, these are “uninterpretable scales.” Also identify any factors with only one item. These factors and their items are candidates to drop.
#Look at the candidates to drop and the factors to be dropped. Is there anything that needs to be retained because it is critical to one&#x27;s construct. For example, if a conceptually important item only cross loads on a factor to be dropped, it is good to keep it for the next round.
#Drop the items, and run a confirmatory factor analysis asking the program to give only the number of factors after dropping the uninterpretable and single-item ones. Go through the process again starting at Step 3. Here various test reliability measures could also be taken.
#Keep running through the process until one get “clean factors” (until all factors have cleanly loaded items).
#Run the Alpha in the statistical program (asking for the Alpha&#x27;s if each item is dropped). Any scales with insufficient Alphas should be dropped and the process repeated from Step 3. [Coefficient alpha=number of items2 x average correlation between different items/sum of all correlations in the correlation matrix (including the diagonal values)]
#Run correlational or regressional statistics to ensure the validity of the scale. For better practices, keep the final factors and all loadings of yours and similar scales selected in the Appendix of the created scale.

== Multi-Item and Single-Item Scales ==
In most practical situations, multi-item scales are more effective in predicting outcomes compared to single items. The use of single-item measures in research is advised cautiously, their use should be limited to specific circumstances. 

Table: Criteria for Assessing the Potential Use of Single-Item Measures

== Data types ==
The type of information collected can influence scale construction. Different types of information are measured in different ways. 
#Some data are measured at the nominal level. That is, any numbers used are mere labels; they express no mathematical properties. Examples are SKU inventory codes and UPC bar codes.
#Some data are measured at the ordinal level. Numbers indicate the relative position of items, but not the magnitude of difference. An example is a preference ranking.
#Some data are measured at the interval level. Numbers indicate the magnitude of difference between items, but there is no absolute zero point. Examples are attitude scales and opinion scales.
#Some data are measured at the ratio level. Numbers indicate magnitude of difference and there is a fixed zero point. Ratios can be calculated. Examples include: age, income, price, costs, sales revenue, sales volume, and market share.

==Composite measures==

Composite measures of variables are created by combining two or more separate empirical indicators into a single measure. Composite measures measure complex concepts more adequately than single indicators, extend the range of scores available and are more efficient at handling multiple items.

In addition to scales, there are two other types of composite measures. Indexes are similar to scales except multiple indicators of a variable are combined into a single measure. The index of consumer confidence, for example, is a combination of several measures of consumer attitudes. A typology is similar to an index except the variable is measured at the nominal level.

Indexes are constructed by accumulating scores assigned to individual attributes, while scales are constructed through the assignment of scores to patterns of attributes.

While indexes and scales provide measures of a single dimension, typologies are often employed to examine the intersection of two or more dimensions. Typologies are very useful analytical tools and can be easily used as independent variables, although since they are not unidimensional it is difficult to use them as a dependent variable.

== Comparative and non comparative scaling ==

With comparative scaling, the items are directly compared with each other (example: Does one prefer Pepsi or Coke?). In noncomparative scaling each item is scaled independently of the others. (Example: How does one feel about Coke?)

==Comparative scaling techniques==

*Pairwise comparison scale – a respondent is presented with two items at a time and asked to select one (example : does one prefer Pepsi or Coke?). This is an ordinal level technique when a measurement model is not applied. Krus and Kennedy (1977) elaborated the paired comparison scaling within their domain-referenced model. The Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) model (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) can be applied in order to derive measurements provided the data derived from paired comparisons possess an appropriate structure. Thurstone&#x27;s Law of comparative judgment can also be applied in such contexts.
*Rasch model scaling – respondents interact with items and comparisons are inferred between items from the responses to obtain scale values. Respondents are subsequently also scaled based on their responses to items given the item scale values. The Rasch model has a close relation to the BTL model.
*Rank-ordering – a respondent is presented with several items simultaneously and asked to rank them (example : Rate the following advertisements from 1 to 10.). This is an ordinal level technique.
*Bogardus social distance scale – measures the degree to which a person is willing to associate with a class or type of people. It asks how willing the respondent is to make various associations. The results are reduced to a single score on a scale. There are also non-comparative versions of this scale.
*Q-Sort – Up to 140 items are sorted into groups based on rank-order procedure.
*Guttman scale – This is a procedure to determine whether a set of items can be rank-ordered on a unidimensional scale. It utilizes the intensity structure among several indicators of a given variable. Statements are listed in order of importance. The rating is scaled by summing all responses until the first negative response in the list. The Guttman scale is related to Rasch measurement; specifically, Rasch models bring the Guttman approach within a probabilistic framework.
*Constant sum scale – a respondent is given a constant sum of money, script, credits, or points and asked to allocate these to various items (example : If one had 100 Yen to spend on food products, how much would one spend on product A, on product B, on product C, etc.). This is an ordinal level technique.
*Magnitude estimation scale – In a psychophysics procedure invented by S. S. Stevens people simply assign numbers to the dimension of judgment. The geometric mean of those numbers usually produces a power law with a characteristic exponent. In cross-modality matching instead of assigning numbers, people manipulate another dimension, such as loudness or brightness to match the items. Typically the exponent of the psychometric function can be predicted from the magnitude estimation exponents of each dimension.

==Non-comparative scaling techniques==

*Visual analogue scale (also called the Continuous rating scale and the graphic rating scale) – respondents rate items by placing a mark on a line. The line is usually labeled at each end. There are sometimes a series of numbers, called scale points, (say, from zero to 100) under the line. Scoring and codification is difficult for paper-and-pencil scales, but not for computerized and Internet-based visual analogue scales.
*Likert scale – Respondents are asked to indicate the amount of agreement or disagreement (from strongly agree to strongly disagree) on a five- to nine-point response scale (not to be confused with a Likert scale). The same format is used for multiple questions. It is the combination of these questions that forms the Likert scale. This categorical scaling procedure can easily be extended to a magnitude estimation procedure that uses the full scale of numbers rather than verbal categories.
*Phrase completion scales – Respondents are asked to complete a phrase on an 11-point response scale in which 0 represents the absence of the theoretical construct and 10 represents the theorized maximum amount of the construct being measured. The same basic format is used for multiple questions.
*Semantic differential scale – Respondents are asked to rate on a 7-point scale an item on various attributes. Each attribute requires a scale with bipolar terminal labels.
*Stapel scale – This is a unipolar ten-point rating scale. It ranges from +5 to −5 and has no neutral zero point.
*Thurstone scale – This is a scaling technique that incorporates the intensity structure among indicators.
*Mathematically derived scale – Researchers infer respondents’ evaluations mathematically. Two examples are multi dimensional scaling and conjoint analysis.

==Scale evaluation==

Scales should be tested for reliability, generalizability, and validity. Generalizability is the ability to make inferences from a sample to the population, given the scale one have selected. Reliability is the extent to which a scale will produce consistent results. Test-retest reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Alternative forms reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms of the scale. Internal consistency reliability checks how well the individual measures included in the scale are converted into a composite measure.

Scales and indexes have to be validated. Internal validation checks the relation between the individual measures included in the scale, and the composite scale itself. External validation checks the relation between the composite scale and other indicators of the variable, indicators not included in the scale. Content validation (also called face validity) checks how well the scale measures what is supposed to measured. Criterion validation checks how meaningful the scale criteria are relative to other possible criteria. Construct validation checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of construct validity. They are convergent validity, discriminant validity, and nomological validity (Campbell and Fiske, 1959; Krus and Ney, 1978). The coefficient of reproducibility indicates how well the data from the individual measures included in the scale can be reconstructed from the composite scale.

<doc id="268974" wikidata="Q16006656" url="?curid=268974" title="Lou Stillman">
<text>Louis Ingber (1887–1969), better known as Lou Stillman, was a legendary boxing trainer who had a gym in New York City, but whose fame transcended beyond New York and into boxing circles virtually everywhere else. He was also a private detective prior to working as a boxing trainer.

In 1919, Ingber was invited by millionaires Alpheus Geer and Hiram Mallison to manage &quot;Stillman&#x27;s Gym&quot;. When Ingber came along, the gym was actually named the &quot;Marshall Stillman Athletic Club&quot;. In the late 1920s, the gym changed its name. Patrons used to think Ingber&#x27;s last name was Stillman; because of this, they greeted him as &quot;Mr. Stillman&quot;. Stillman, described as moody and acid-tonged, among other things, by boxing historians and writers, disliked having to correct everyone who called him &quot;Mr. Stillman&quot;, so eventually he changed his name legally from &quot;Louis Ingber&quot; to &quot;Lou Stillman&quot;.

Stillman was famous for keeping his gym as unsanitary as possible: He allowed the public to smoke in a closed-windows atmosphere, and he let the gym floors to go uncleaned, sometimes for years. He said: &quot;The golden age of prizefighting was the age of bad food, bad air, bad sanitation, and no sunlight. I keep the place like this for the fighters&#x27; own good. If I clean it up they&#x27;ll catch a cold from the cleanliness&quot;.

Stillman carried a gun around his waist when he was at the gym. He had two guards watching the doors, to make sure everyone paid the 25 cents price to get in and watch the boxers practice. He had a sign that read: &quot;Anyone caught stealing will be barred for life&quot;. When French dancer Jeanne Lamar showed up at Stillman&#x27;s to train in 1922, Stillman told her that there were &quot;no facilities for girls&quot; in his gym, but she stood around and used the gym to get in shape anyway.

Many famous people trained there, mainly boxers: Jack Dempsey, Georges Carpentier, Primo Carnera, Fred Apostoli, Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano were some of the famous world champions who trained at Stillman&#x27;s Gym. One who refused to train there was Gene Tunney, because he complained about the place&#x27;s sanitation, saying that he would never train there unless the windows were opened. Typical of him, Stillman refused to open the windows.

Stillman retired in 1959 after selling the building, and he joined his daughter in California. He liked painting, and became proficient painting in oils as he spent the last few years of his life at a nursing home in Santa Barbara. He died on August 19, 1969.

==In popular culture==
Stillman&#x27;s Gym was featured in several motion pictures, including the Rocky Graziano biographical film &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956) and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955), which has a musical number set in the gym, &quot;Baby You Knock Me Out,&quot; featuring Cyd Charisse.

<text>Rahab () is used in the Hebrew Bible to indicate pride or arrogance, a mystical sea monster, as an emblematic or poetic name for Egypt, and for the sea.

Raḥab or Rachav () is a term for the Abyss.

== Biblical usage ==
=== As primeval sea-monster ===
Rahab appears in Psalm 89:10, Isaiah 51:9–10, and Job 26:12. Rahab, in these passages, takes the meaning of primeval, chaotic, multi-headed sea-dragon or Leviathan. &quot;Thou didst crush Rahab, as one that is slain; Thou didst scatter Thine enemies with the arm of Thy strength.&quot; Psalm 89:10

&quot;Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Art thou not it that hewed Rahab in pieces, that pierced the dragon?&quot; Isaiah 51:9–10

&quot;He stirreth up the sea with His power, and by His understanding He smiteth through Rahab.&quot; Job 26:12

The Babylonians told of a sky-god, Marduk, and a sea-goddess, Tiamat, battling for supreme power over the other gods, in the Enūma Eliš. It has been speculated these two characters in the Babylonian myth are parallel to the creation stories found in the biblical passages containing the name Rahab. There is a possible connection between the monster Rahab and the fragmentary attested Akkadian chaos-dragon Labbu.

=== As insolence or pride ===
In Isaiah 30:7, &quot;rahav&quot; becomes a proverbial expression that alludes to insolence. &quot;For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I called her arrogancy that sitteth still.&quot; Isaiah 30:7

In the Book of Job, &quot;rahav&quot; occurs in the Hebrew text and is translated in the King James Version as &quot;proud&quot;. &quot;If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.&quot; Job 9:13

=== Egypt ===
Rahab is a poetical name for Egypt. It might have Egyptian origins that were accommodated to the Hebrew language, although there is no relevant term in Coptic language.

== Jewish folklore ==
In medieval Jewish folklore, Rahab is a mythical sea monster, a dragon of the waters, the &quot;demonic angel of the sea&quot;. Rahab represents the primordial abyss, the water dragon of darkness and chaos, comparable to Leviathan and Tiamat. Rahab later became a particular demon, inhabitant of the sea, especially associated with the Red Sea.

== Modern culture ==
Rahab is the official Hebrew name for the planet Neptune in a vote organised by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009.

Several Israel Navy submarines also bear the name, including the fifth Dolphin class submarine, which officially entered service in January, 2016: The INS Rahav.

In the video game &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot;, the boss character Rahab is a vampire who has evolved into a marine fish-like creature, possibly a reference to the mythic sea monster.

<doc id="268984" wikidata="Q27814" url="?curid=268984" title="Cambria">
<text>Cambria is a name for Wales, being the Latinised form of the Welsh name for the country, . The term was not in use during the Roman period (when Wales had not come into existence as a distinct entity) or the early medieval period. After the Anglo-Saxon settlement of much of Britain, a territorial distinction developed between the new Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (which would become England and Southern Scotland) and the remaining Celtic British kingdoms (which would become Wales and, before their absorption into England and Scotland, Cornwall to the south and Strathclyde or Hen Ogledd to the north). Latin being the primary language of scholarship in Western Christendom, medieval writers commonly used either the older term &quot;Britannia&quot;, as the territory still inhabited by Britons, or &quot;Wallia&quot;, a term derived from Old English, to refer to Wales. The term &quot;Cambria&quot; is first attested in Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century as an alternative to both of these, since &quot;Britannia&quot; was now ambiguous and &quot;Wallia&quot; a foreign import, but remained rare until late in the Middle Ages.
==Etymology==
The Welsh word (Wales), along with (Welsh people), was falsely supposed by 17th-century Celticists to be connected to the Biblical Gomer, or to the Cimbri or the Cimmerians of antiquity. In reality, it is descended from the Brittonic word &quot;combrogi&quot;, meaning &#x27;fellow-countrymen&#x27;. The name thus conveyed something like &#x27;[Land of] the Compatriots&#x27;. The use of as a self-designation seems to have arisen in the post-Roman era, to refer collectively to the Brittonic-speaking peoples of Britain, inhabiting what are now Wales, Cornwall, Northern England, and Southern Scotland. It came into use as a self-description probably before the 7th century and is attested (as ) in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan (, by Afan Ferddig) . In Welsh literature, the word was used throughout the Middle Ages to describe the Welsh, though the older, more generic term continued to be used to describe any of the Britonnic peoples (including the Welsh) and was the more common literary term until . Thereafter, prevailed as a reference to the Welsh. Until , the word was spelt or , regardless of whether it referred to the people or the country; for the country evolved later. The Latinised form emerged in the Middle Ages, first attested in, and perhaps coined by, Geoffrey of Monmouth.

==Cambria in legend==
According to Geoffrey of Monmouth in the first part of his pseudohistory (&#x27;History of the Kings of Britain&#x27;), the Trojan Brutus had three sons with his wife Innogen, among whom he divided his lands after landing in Britain and subduing Gogmagog. His eldest son, Locrinus, received the land between the rivers Humber and Severn, which he called &quot;Loegria&quot; (a Latinisation of the medieval Welsh name (modern Welsh: ), later to be most of England). His youngest son, Albanactus, got the lands beyond the Humber, which took from him the name of &quot;Albany&quot; (Latin , not to be confused with other places of this name; in Welsh; later Scotland). The second son, Camber, was bequeathed everything beyond the Severn, which was called after him (later Wales and then-Brittonic areas immediately to the north and south of it). His general Corineus retained Cornwall, which was named after him.

This legend was widely accepted as fact throughout the 12th–16th centuries, though it bears no resemblance to actual political, demographic, or linguistic history.

==Legacy==
The name &quot;Cambria&quot; lives on in some local names, e.g. Cambrian Line, Cambrian Way. It is also used internationally in geology to denote the geologic period between around 539 million years and 488.3 million years ago; in 1835, the geologist Adam Sedgwick named this geological period the Cambrian, after studying rocks of that age in Wales.

It is also a rare feminine given name.

It is also found in the name of a number of colleges stretching across north east Wales, collectively the .

It is also referenced in the well-known song &quot;Men of Harlech,&quot; which regales an event of exceptional endurance and valor in 15th-century Wales. This song is popular with supporters of Cardiff City Football Club, and also the Welsh national team.
The popular song &quot;Wrexham is the Name&quot; is sung by fans of Wrexham AFC and follows the same tune.

The dialogue in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; uses &quot;Cambria&quot; rather than &quot;Wales&quot; throughout.

Once the name used for most of upland Wales, the term Cambrian Mountains is now more localised and includes the area from Pumlumon down to Mynydd Mallaen.

Cambria is the name of a font in Microsoft Windows.

In horticulture, &quot;Cambria&quot; orchids are those that are hybrids between genera &quot;Odontoglossum&quot;, &quot;Oncidium&quot;, &quot;Brassia&quot;, and &quot;Miltonia&quot;, all members of the subtribe Oncidiinae.

<text>Tannin ( &quot;tannīn&quot;; &quot;tannīnā&quot; plural: &quot;tannīnē&quot;; &#x27;, ultimately from [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] 𒆗𒉌𒈾 &quot;dannina&quot;) orTunnanu&quot;&#x27; (Ugaritic: 𐎚𐎐𐎐 &quot;tnn&quot;, likely vocalized &quot;tunnanu&quot;) was a sea monster in Canaanite and Hebrew mythology used as a symbol of chaos and evil.

==Canaanite mythology==
Tannin appears in the Baal Cycle as one of the servants of Yam () defeated by Baʿal () or bound by his sister, Anat. He is usually depicted as serpentine, possibly with a double tail.

==Hebrew mythology==
The &quot;tanninim&quot; () also appear in the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s Book of Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Job, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. They are explicitly listed among the creatures created by God on the fifth day of the Genesis creation narrative, translated in the King James Version as &quot;great whales&quot;. The tannin is listed in the apocalypse of Isaiah as among the sea beasts to be slain by Yahweh &quot;on that day&quot;, translated in the King James Version as &quot;the dragon&quot;.

In Judaism, tannin is the term used for sea monsters such as Leviathan and Rahab. Along with Rahab, &quot;Tannin&quot; was a name applied to ancient Egypt after the Exodus to Canaan.

The word &quot;Tannin&quot; is used in the Hebrew Bible fourteen times. Aaron&#x27;s staff becomes &quot;Tannin&quot; in the Book of Exodus (Exodus 7:9-12), it is used in the meaning &quot;snake&quot; in the Book of Deuteronomy (Deut 32:33) and Psalms (Psalm 91:13). It represents Nebuchadnezzar II (the king of Babylon) in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 51:34) and Pharaoh in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 29:3, 32:2). In the Book of Job (Job 7:12) the protagonist questions God &quot;Am I the sea or the sea dragon that you have set a guard over me?&quot;

The name has subsequently been given to three submarines in the Israeli Navy: the first, an S-class submarine formerly known as HMS &quot;Springer&quot;, was in commission from 1958 until 1972. The second, a &quot;Gal&quot;-class submarine, was in commission from 1977 until 2002. The third INS &quot;Tanin&quot; is a &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarine in commission since 2014.

== Modern Hebrew ==

In modern Hebrew usage, the word &quot;tanin&quot; (תנין) means crocodile.

<text>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) is a public research university in Sai Kung District, New Territories, Hong Kong. Founded in 1991, it was the territory&#x27;s third institution to be granted university status, and the first university without any precursory existence upon its formation. It occupies a seaside site in Tai Po Tsai, Clear Water Bay Peninsula.

The university is organised into four academic schools focusing on business and management, engineering, humanities and social science, and science. In the 2023-24 academic year, it enrolled around 10,000 undergraduates and 6,800 postgraduates, and employed 835 academic staff. In most major university rankings, it is consistently ranked within Asia&#x27;s top 15, and is regarded as one of the top young universities in the world.

HKUST also stands for Hong Kong University of Stress and Tension.

==History==
In the late 1980s, the Hong Kong Government anticipated a strong demand for university graduates to fuel an economy increasingly based on services. Sir Sze-Yuen Chung and the territory’s governor, Sir Edward Youde, conceived the idea of establishing a third university, in addition to the pre-existing University of Hong Kong and Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Planning for the “Third University”, as the university was known provisionally, began in 1986. On 8 November 1989, Charles, Prince of Wales (now King Charles III) laid the foundation stone of the campus, which was constructed at the Kohima Barracks site in Tai Po Tsai on the Clear Water Bay Peninsula. The site was earmarked for the construction of a new British Army garrison to house the 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own and 7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, but plans for its construction were shelved after the 1984 signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration resulted in the downsizing of army presence in Hong Kong.

Originally scheduled to finish in 1994, the planning committee for the university decided in 1987 that the new institution should open its doors three years early, in keeping with the community&#x27;s need and in fulfilment of the wishes of Youde, who died in 1986. The university was officially opened by Youde&#x27;s successor as governor, Sir David Wilson, on 10 October 1991. Several leading scientists and researchers took up positions at the university in its early years, including physicist Leroy Chang who arrived in 1993 as Dean of Science and went on to become vice-president for academic affairs. Thomas E. Stelson was also a founding member of the administration.

The project was criticised for surpassing the budget set forth by the Hong Kong Government and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. However, under the fund-raising efforts of its president, Woo Chia-wei, the first students enrolled in October 1991. By 1992, the second phase of HKUST&#x27;s campus was completed, expanding laboratories, student and staff accommodation, and athletic facilities to support about 7,000 students.

Several more expansion projects such as the construction of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Enterprise Center have since been completed. The library extension building, Lee Shau Kee Business Building (LSK), Lo Ka Chung Building, South Bus Station, Undergraduate Halls VIII and IX, Cheng Yu Tung Building (CYT) and the Conference Lodge, are the latest additions to the campus.

=== &quot;30 for 30&quot; Campaign ===
In February 2023, to coincide with its 30th anniversary, HKUST announced “30 for 30” talent acquisition campaign, a global hunt for 30 leading academics to drive innovation in Hong Kong with 30 major research projects designed to have maximum social impact. The campaign focused on six areas: biomedicine, material science and future energy, artificial intelligence, fintech, green technology, and art technology.

==Governance==
Established in 1991 under Chapter 1141 of the laws of Hong Kong (&quot;The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Ordinance&quot;), HKUST is one of the eight statutory universities in Hong Kong. It is an institution funded by the University Grants Committee (UGC).

As with all other statutory universities in Hong Kong, the chief executive of HKSAR acts as the chancellor of HKUST. Prior to the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, this was a ceremonial title bestowed upon the governor of Hong Kong.

===Council===
The supreme governing body of the university is its Council, formed by a total of 27 members. Council members include university administrators, the chairperson of the alumni Convocation, an elected staff member, an elected full-time student representative, as well as 17 &quot;lay members&quot; not being employees or students at the university. Under the &quot;HKUST Ordinance&quot;, the chief executive of Hong Kong possesses the power of directly appointing the chairman and vice-chairman of the council, the treasurer of the university, and not more than 9 of the lay members.

===Senate===
The Senate acts as the university&#x27;s supreme academic body, responsible for making and reviewing the academic policies of the university. It is composed mostly of academic staff members but also includes the Students&#x27; Union president, an elected representative of the undergraduates as well as an elected representative of the postgraduates.

===Court===
Being the supreme advisory body of the university, the court is responsible for promoting the university&#x27;s interests and to raise funds.

==Campus==

The university is largely a campus university, occupying a 60-hectare site at the northern part of Clear Water Bay Peninsula in Sai Kung District, New Territories, Hong Kong, overlooking Port Shelter in Tai Po Tsai. The campus layout and architecture is based on a master plan submitted jointly by Simon Kwan &amp; Associates and Percy Thomas Partnership, the runner-up entry in an architectural competition held before the university was founded.

As the campus has a sloped terrain, buildings and facilities are built on separate terraces carved out of the hillside, with the academic facilities occupying the top-level terraces, and undergraduate halls of residence and sporting facilities at the seafront. The terraces are connected by motor roads as well as a network of footbridges and elevators known as Bridge Link.

The countryside setting of the university contributed to the fact that HKUST was once the only public university in Hong Kong not being directly served by an MTR station, prior to the re-titling of the Education University of Hong Kong. The university is connected to the metro network through public bus routes including 91, 91M, 91P, 291P and 792M, complemented by a handful of minibus services, with Choi Hung and Hang Hau stations being the major feeder points.

===Academic complexes===
Academic activities are mainly conducted in the Academic Building, which contains 10 lecture theatres (A-H, J-K), a multitude of classrooms, laboratories and administrative offices. The lecture theatres can accommodate classes of up to 450 students and offer audiovisual equipment. In addition, an information center and a souvenir shop can be found at the Piazza.
Prior to 2013, offices and classrooms of all of the four schools were grouped under the same roof in the Academic Building. With the completion of the Lee Shau Kee Business Building (LSK) in 2013, most facilities for the School of Business and Management have relocated from the Academic Building. Opened in 2015, the Cheng Yu Tung Building (CYT) afforded the other schools with a lecture theatre (L), additional classrooms and laboratories.

Located at the southern tip of the campus, the Lo Ka Chung Building houses the HKUST Jockey Club Institute of Advanced Study (IAS). The adjacent Conference Lodge, managed by the hotel-operating arm of Chinachem Group offers on-campus accommodations for conference attendees and official guests of the university.

===Student halls and staff housing===
A total of nine undergraduate halls are located at the seafront and mid-rise terraces of the university campus. Also, the university provides 404 Senior Staff Quarters flats and 40 University Apartments flats to its eligible senior staff.

===Lee Shau Kee Library===

The HKUST Lee Shau Kee Library, part of the Hong Kong Academic Library Link (HKALL), occupies a central location of the campus. Connected to the Academic Building, it is accessible directly from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Atrium. It spans five floors with over 12,350 sq m of floor space, providing more than 3,674 seats as well as computing facilities. It offers a wide array of information resources, both local and remote. In addition to over 720,000 print and electronic volumes and a large collection of media resources, it provides access to more than 47,000 periodical titles, a large number of e-books, databases, and other digital information resources. 

The library owns a collection of old maps of China and the rest of Asia, produced by Chinese and Western cartographers over the last 500 years. A selection of these maps, providing an insight into the history of international geographic knowledge, was published by the library in a limited-edition (1000 copies) volume in 2003.
=== Shaw Auditorium ===
Donated by Shaw Foundation, Shaw Auditorium is a 4-storey multi-purpose auditorium designed for concerts, lectures, musicals and visual productions. The building consists of three superimposed elliptic rings surrounding a sculptural core. The rings that blend into the architecture provide shade and rain protection around the building. The auditorium is equipped with modular seating that can be adapted to allow for multiple arrangements, ranging from 850 to up to 1300 seats. Its curved walls can function as a 360-degree projection screen, enabling audio-visual experiences.

HKUST opened Shaw Auditorium on 17 November 2021, as part of a celebration of the university’s 30th anniversary.

===Ancillary services===
The campus boasts 18 catering outlets including fast food restaurants, a Chinese restaurant as well as a restaurant serving international cuisine; other ancillary facilities in the academic complexes include three banks, a supermarket, clinics (consisting of a medical clinic providing free outpatient service to all full-time students and staff, a student dental clinic, and a staff dental clinic) and Students&#x27; Union offices.

=== Sustainable Smart Campus as a Living Lab initiative ===
In 2019, HKUST launched the Sustainable Smart Campus as a Living Lab initiative. The initiative aims to transform the campus into a testing ground for learning, experimenting, and advancing smart and innovative ideas to address real-life challenges. Wei Shyy, the former President of HKUST, said the initiative is to &quot;nurture a new generation who can produce original solutions with a sustainability mindset.&quot; As of 2021, around 30 sustainability-related projects have been launched. HKUST launched “Blockcerts” platform in 2020 which is a blockchain-based degree authentication system to verify the documents such as graduation diplomas and academic transcripts. HKUST is the first university in Hong Kong to launch a similar system.

=== HKUST (Guangzhou) ===
In 2018, HKUST signed collaboration agreements with Guangzhou Government and Guangzhou University to establish The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) (HKUST(GZ)) in Nansha, Guangzhou. On 29 June 2022, Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China approved the establishment of HKUST(GZ), which is the third university co-managed by mainland China and Hong Kong. HKUST(GZ) officially opened on 1 September 2022.

For year 2022–23, HKUST enrolled 10,455 undergraduates and 6,810 postgraduates, with over 40% (~2,000 undergraduates &amp; ~5,000 postgraduates) of the total enrolment being non-local (not holding Hong Kong citizenship). In terms of student population, the School of Engineering is the largest among the university&#x27;s four schools, hosting 34% and 36% of HKUST&#x27;s undergraduates and postgraduates respectively; this was followed by the schools of Business and Management (34%/24%), Science (21%/20%), and Humanities and Social Science (3%/8%).

A total of 2,129 local students were admitted to undergraduate programs offered by the university in 2018/19. The university saw the graduation of 2,317 undergraduate students, 506 research postgraduates and 2,224 taught postgraduates in the same academic year, amounting to a total of 5,047 degrees being conferred.

===Students&#x27; residence===

All full-time registered UG students and in-time full-time HKUST research postgraduate students (RPgs) of the university are eligible to apply for student housing. Under the current policy, all local UG students are guaranteed at least one semester of hall residence in their first year of study upon application, whilst their non-local counterparts are provided at least two years of residency.

The nine on-campus undergraduate halls provide a total of 146 bed places in single rooms, 3,094 in double rooms (twin + bunk) and 792 in triple rooms. Another 512 bed spaces in double rooms at the off-campus HKUST Jockey Club Hall in Tseung Kwan O New Town are also provided for undergraduates. For research postgraduates students and visiting interns, 1080 on-campus residential places in single or double rooms are available.

There are also off-campus accommodations available. 15 apartments in Tai Po Tsai Village (TPT308 and Wan&#x27;s Lodge) are rented by the university to accommodate 90 TPgs.

On 27 April 2012, research postgraduate students organised a sit-down strike to raise the voice of the voiceless and reiterate the concerns of the research postgraduate students about the serious housing issue.

===Students&#x27; union===
Formed in 1992, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Students&#x27; Union (HKUSTSU) is an organisation independent from but recognised by the university administration. The union is governed by four independent statutory bodies, namely the executive committee, the council, the editorial board and the court. All undergraduates and postgraduates are eligible for membership in the union, although this is not compulsory.

The students&#x27; union oversees over 100 affiliated societies catering to students engaged in different academic disciplines, residential halls, sports and interests.

<text>The Donner Party, sometimes called the Donner–Reed Party, were a group of American pioneers who migrated to California in a wagon train from the Midwest. Delayed by a multitude of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846–1847 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Some of the migrants resorted to cannibalism to survive, mainly eating the bodies of those who had succumbed to starvation, sickness, or extreme cold, but in one case two Native American guides were murdered and eaten.

The Donner Party originated from Springfield, Illinois, and departed Independence, Missouri, on the Oregon Trail in the spring of 1846. The journey west usually took between four and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed after electing to follow a new route called the Hastings Cutoff, which bypassed established trails and instead crossed the Rocky Mountains&#x27; Wasatch Range and the Great Salt Lake Desert in present-day Utah. The desolate and rugged terrain, and the difficulties they later encountered while traveling along the Humboldt River in present-day Nevada, resulted in the loss of many cattle and wagons, and divisions soon formed within the group.

By early November, the migrants had reached the Sierra Nevada but became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee Lake (now Donner Lake) high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran dangerously low, and in mid-December some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the migrants, but the first relief party did not arrive until the middle of February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train became trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived. Historians have described the episode as one of the most fascinating tragedies in California history and in the record of American westward migration.

==Background==

During the 1840s there was a dramatic increase in settlers leaving the east to resettle in the Oregon Territory or California, which at the time were accessible only by a very long sea voyage or a daunting overland journey. Some, such as Patrick Breen, saw California, then a part of Mexico, as a place where they would be free to live in a fully Catholic culture; others were attracted to the West&#x27;s burgeoning economic opportunities or inspired by manifest destiny, the belief that the land between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans belonged to European Americans and that they should settle it. Most wagon trains followed the Oregon Trail route from a starting point in Independence, Missouri, to the Continental Divide, traveling about a day on a journey that usually took between four and six months. The trail generally followed rivers to South Pass, a mountain pass in present-day Wyoming which was relatively easy for wagons to negotiate. From there, pioneers had a choice of routes to their destinations.

Lansford Hastings, an early migrant from Ohio to the West, published &quot;The Emigrants&#x27; Guide to Oregon and California&quot; to encourage settlers. As an alternative to the Oregon Trail&#x27;s standard route through Idaho&#x27;s Snake River Plain, he proposed a more direct route (which actually increased the trip&#x27;s mileage by 125 miles) to California across the Great Basin, which would take travelers through the Wasatch Range and across the Great Salt Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger, a scant supply station run by Jim Bridger at Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second person documented to have crossed the southern part of the Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.

Arguably the most difficult part of the journey to California was the last across the Sierra Nevada. This mountain range has 500 distinct peaks over high, and because of its height and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the range receives more snow than most other ranges in North America. The eastern side of the range, the Sierra Escarpment, is notoriously steep. After a wagon train left Missouri for Oregon or California, timing was crucial to ensure that it would not be bogged down by mud created by spring rains or by massive snowdrifts in the mountains from September onward, and that horses and oxen had enough spring grass to eat.

==Families==
In the spring of 1846, almost 500 wagons headed west from Independence. At the rear of the train, a group of nine wagons containing 32 members of the Reed and Donner families and their employees left on May 12. George Donner was about 60 years old and living near Springfield, Illinois. With him were his 44-year-old wife Tamsen, their three daughters Frances (6), Georgia (4) and Eliza (3), and George&#x27;s daughters from a previous marriage: Elitha (14) and Leanna (12). George&#x27;s younger brother Jacob (56) joined the party with his wife Elizabeth (45), stepsons Solomon Hook (14) and William Hook (12), and five children: George (9), Mary (7), Isaac (6), Lewis (4) and Samuel (1). Also traveling with the Donner brothers were teamsters Hiram O. Miller (29), Samuel Shoemaker (25), Noah James (16), Charles Burger (30), John Denton (28) and Augustus Spitzer (30).
James F. Reed (45) was accompanied on the journey by his wife Margret (32), stepdaughter Virginia (13), daughter Martha Jane (&quot;Patty&quot;, 8), sons James and Thomas (5 and 3) and Sarah Keyes, Margret&#x27;s mother. Keyes was in the advanced stages of tuberculosis and died at a campsite they named Alcove Springs. She was buried nearby, off to the side of the trail, with a gray rock inscribed, &quot;Mrs. Sarah Keyes, Died May 29, 1846; Aged 70&quot;. In addition to leaving financial worries behind, Reed hoped that California&#x27;s climate would help Margret, who had long suffered from ill health. The Reeds hired three men to drive the ox teams: Milford (&quot;Milt&quot;) Elliott (28), James Smith (25) and Walter Herron (25). Baylis Williams (24) went along as handyman and his sister, Eliza (25), as the family&#x27;s cook.

Within a week of leaving Independence, the Reeds and Donners joined a group of 50 wagons nominally led by William H. Russell. By June 16, the company had traveled , with to go before Fort Laramie. They had been delayed by rain and a rising river, but Tamsen Donner wrote to a friend in Springfield, &quot;indeed, if I do not experience something far worse than I have yet done, I shall say the trouble is all in getting started&quot;. Young Virginia Reed recalled years later that, during the first part of the trip, she was &quot;perfectly happy&quot;.

Several other families joined the wagon train along the way. Levinah Murphy (37), a widow from Tennessee, headed a family of thirteen. Her five youngest children were: John Landrum (16), Meriam (&quot;Mary&quot;, 14), Lemuel (12), William (10) and Simon (8). Levinah&#x27;s two married daughters and their families also came along: Sarah Murphy Foster (19), her husband William M. (30) and son Jeremiah George (1); Harriet Murphy Pike (18), her husband William M. (32) and their daughters Naomi (3) and Catherine (1). William H. Eddy (28), a carriage maker from Illinois, brought his wife Eleanor (25) and their two children, James (3) and Margaret (1). The Breen family consisted of Patrick Breen (51), a farmer from Iowa, his wife Margaret (&quot;Peggy&quot;, 40) and seven children: John (14), Edward (13), Patrick, Jr. (9), Simon (8), James (5), Peter (3) and 11-month-old Isabella. Their neighbor, 40-year-old bachelor Patrick Dolan, traveled with them. German immigrant Lewis Keseberg (32) joined, along with his wife Elisabeth Philippine (22) and daughter Ada (2); son Lewis Jr. was born on the trail. Two young single men named Spitzer and Reinhardt traveled with another German couple, the Wolfingers, who were rumored to be wealthy; they also had a hired driver, &quot;Dutch Charley&quot; Burger. An older man named Hardkoop rode with them. Luke Halloran, a young man with tuberculosis, could no longer ride horseback; the families he had been traveling with no longer had resources to care for him. He was taken in by George Donner at Little Sandy River and rode in their wagon.

==Hastings Cutoff==
To promote his new route (the &quot;Hastings Cutoff&quot;), Lansford Hastings sent riders to deliver letters to traveling migrants. On July 12, the Reeds and Donners were given one. Hastings warned the migrants they could expect opposition from the Mexican authorities in California and advised them to band together in large groups. He also claimed to have &quot;worked out a new and better road to California&quot; and said he would be waiting at Fort Bridger to guide the migrants along the new cutoff.
On July 20, at the Little Sandy River, most of the wagon train opted to follow the established trail via Fort Hall. A smaller group opted to head for Fort Bridger and needed a leader. James Reed had military experience, but his autocratic attitude had rubbed many in the party the wrong way: they saw him as aristocratic, imperious and ostentatious. By comparison, the mature, experienced Donner&#x27;s peaceful and charitable nature made him the group&#x27;s first choice. While the members of the party were comfortably well-off by contemporary standards, most of them were inexperienced in long, difficult, overland travel. Additionally, the members of the party had little knowledge about how to interact with Native Americans.

Journalist Edwin Bryant reached Blacks Fork a week ahead of the Donner Party. He saw the first part of the trail and was concerned that it would be difficult for the wagons in the Donner group, especially with so many women and children. He returned to Blacks Fork to leave letters warning several members of the group not to take Hastings&#x27;s shortcut. By the time the Donner Party reached Blacks Fork on July 27, Hastings had already left, leading the forty wagons of the Harlan–Young group. Because Jim Bridger&#x27;s trading post would fare substantially better if people used the Hastings Cutoff, Bridger told the party that the shortcut was a smooth trip, devoid of rugged country and hostile Native Americans, and would shorten their journey by . Water would be easy to find along the way, although a couple of days crossing a dry lake bed would be necessary.

Reed was very impressed with this information and advocated for the Hastings Cutoff. None of the party received Bryant&#x27;s letters; in his diary account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony. At Fort Laramie, Reed met an old friend named James Clyman who was coming from California. Clyman warned Reed not to take the Hastings Cutoff, telling him that wagons would not be able to make it and that Hastings&#x27; information was inaccurate. Fellow pioneer Jesse Quinn Thornton traveled part of the way with Donner and Reed, and in his book &quot;From Oregon and California in 1848&quot; declared Hastings the &quot;Baron Munchausen of travelers in these countries&quot;. Tamsen Donner, according to Thornton, was &quot;gloomy, sad, and dispirited&quot; at the thought of turning off the main trail on the advice of Hastings, whom she considered &quot;a selfish adventurer&quot;.

On July 31, 1846, the Donner Party left Blacks Fork after four days of rest and wagon repairs, eleven days behind the leading Harlan–Young group. Donner hired a replacement driver, and the company was joined by the McCutchen family, consisting of William (30), his wife Amanda (24), their two-year-old daughter Harriet and a 16-year-old named Jean Baptiste Trudeau from New Mexico, who claimed to have knowledge of the Native Americans and terrain on the way to California.

===Wasatch Range===

The party turned south to follow the Hastings Cutoff. Within days, they found the terrain to be much more difficult than described. Drivers were forced to lock the wheels of their wagons to prevent them from rolling down steep inclines. Years of traffic on the main Oregon Trail had left an easy and obvious path, whereas the Cutoff was more difficult to find. 

Hastings wrote directions and left letters stuck to trees. On August 6, the party found a letter from him advising them to stop until he could show them an alternate route to that taken by the Harlan–Young Party. Reed, Charles T. Stanton and William Pike rode ahead to get Hastings. They encountered exceedingly difficult canyons where boulders had to be moved and walls cut off precariously to a river below, a route likely to break wagons. In his letter Hastings had offered to guide the Donner Party around the more difficult areas, but he rode back only part way, indicating the general direction to follow.
Stanton and Pike stopped to rest and Reed returned alone to the group, arriving four days after the party&#x27;s departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan–Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed&#x27;s urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about a day. All able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.

As the Donner Party made its way across the Wasatch Range of the Rocky Mountains, the Graves family, who had set off to find them, reached them. They consisted of Franklin Ward Graves (57), his wife Elizabeth (45), their children Mary (20), William (18), Eleanor (15), Lovina (13), Nancy (9), Jonathan (7), Franklin, Jr. (5), Elizabeth (1) and married daughter Sarah (22), plus son-in-law Jay Fosdick (23) and a 25-year-old teamster named John Snyder, traveling together in three wagons. Their arrival brought the Donner Party to 87 members in 60–80 wagons. The Graves family had been part of the last group to leave Missouri, confirming the Donner Party was at the back of the year&#x27;s western exodus.

It was August 20 by the time that they reached a point in the mountains where they could see the Great Salt Lake. It took almost another two weeks to travel out of the Wasatch Range. The men began arguing, and doubts were expressed about the wisdom of those who had chosen this route, in particular Reed. Food and supplies began to run out for some of the less affluent families. Stanton and Pike had ridden out with Reed but had become lost on their way back; by the time the party found them, they were a day away from eating their horses.

===Great Salt Lake Desert===

Luke Halloran died of tuberculosis on August 25. A few days later, the party came across a tattered letter from Hastings. The pieces indicated there were two days and nights of difficult travel ahead without grass or water. The party rested their oxen and prepared for the trip. After 36 hours they set off to traverse a mountain in their path. From its peak they saw ahead a dry, barren plain, perfectly flat and covered with white salt, larger than the one they had just crossed, and &quot;one of the most inhospitable places on earth&quot; according to Rarick. Their oxen were already fatigued, and their water was nearly gone.

The Donner Party pressed onward on August 30, having no alternative. In the heat of the day, the moisture underneath the salt crust rose to the surface and turned it into a gummy mass. The wagon wheels sank into it, in some cases up to the hubs. The days were blisteringly hot and the nights frigid. Several of the group saw visions of lakes and wagon trains and believed they had finally overtaken Hastings. After three days, the water was gone and some of the party removed their oxen from the wagons to press ahead to find more. Some of the animals were so weakened they were left yoked to the wagons and abandoned. Nine of Reed&#x27;s ten oxen broke free, crazed with thirst, and bolted off into the desert. Many other families&#x27; cattle and horses went missing. The journey irreparably damaged some of the wagons, but no human lives were lost. Instead of the promised two-day journey over , the journey across of the Great Salt Lake Desert took six.

None of the party had any remaining faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs on the other side of the desert. They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to other wagons. Reed&#x27;s family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to Sutter&#x27;s Fort in California; he had heard that John Sutter was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip. The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another of desert lay ahead.

Their cattle and oxen were now exhausted and lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed. The journey seemed to get easier, particularly through the valley next to the Ruby Mountains. Despite their near-hatred of Hastings, they had no choice but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the Humboldt River. The &quot;shortcut&quot; had probably delayed them by a month.

==Rejoining the trail==
===Reed banished===
Along the Humboldt River, the group met Paiute Native Americans, who joined them for a couple of days but stole or shot several oxen and horses. By now, it was well into October, and the Donner families split off to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed&#x27;s hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder rained blows onto his head with a whip handle—when Reed&#x27;s wife attempted to intervene, she too was struck. Reed retaliated by fatally stabbing Snyder.

That evening, the witnesses gathered to discuss what was to be done. American laws were not applicable west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. But George Donner, the party&#x27;s leader, was a full day ahead of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit Reed, and some claimed he had also hit his wife, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were to be taken care of by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his stepdaughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him with a rifle and food.

===Disintegration===

The trials that the Donner Party had so far endured resulted in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the animals&#x27; load, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man that he had to walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen they had split open; he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find him, but they all refused, swearing they would waste no more resources on a man almost 70 years old.

Meanwhile, Reed caught up with the Donners and proceeded with one of his teamsters, Walter Herron. The two shared a horse and were able to cover per day. The rest of the party rejoined the Donners, but their hardship continued. Native Americans chased away all of Graves&#x27; horses, and another wagon was left behind. With grass in short supply, the cattle spread out more, which allowed the Paiutes to steal 18 more during one evening; several mornings later, they shot another 21. So far, the company had lost nearly 100 oxen and cattle, and their rations were almost completely depleted. With nearly all his cattle gone, Wolfinger stopped at the Humboldt Sink to cache (bury) his wagon; Reinhardt and Spitzer stayed behind to help. They returned without him, reporting they had been attacked by Paiutes and he had been killed. One more stretch of desert lay ahead. The Eddys&#x27; oxen had been killed by Native Americans and they were forced to abandon their wagon. The family had eaten all their stores, but the other families refused to assist their children. The Eddys were forced to walk, carrying their children and miserable with thirst. Margret Reed and her children were also now without a wagon. But the desert soon came to an end, and the party found the Truckee River in beautiful lush country.

The company had little time to rest. They pressed on to cross the Sierra Nevada before the snows came. Stanton, one of the two men who had left a month earlier to seek assistance in California, found the company; he brought mules and food from Sutter&#x27;s Fort, and two Native American guides employed by John Sutter. These Miwok men from the Cosumnes River area were known by their Catholic conversion names: Luis and Salvador. Stanton also brought news that Reed and Herron, although haggard and starving, had reached Sutter&#x27;s Fort. By this point, according to Rarick, &quot;To the bedraggled, half-starved members of the Donner Party, it must have seemed that the worst of their problems had passed.&quot;

==Snowbound==
===Donner Pass===

Faced with one last push over mountains that were described as much worse than the Wasatch Range, the Donner Party had to decide whether to forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told the pass (now known as Donner Pass) would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey—first the Breens, then the Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graves, and the Murphys. The Donners traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of their wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood but it seemed a superficial wound.

Snow began to fall. The Breens made it up the &quot;massive, nearly vertical slope&quot; to Truckee Lake (now known as Donner Lake), from the pass summit, and camped near a cabin that had been built two years earlier by members of the Stephens–Townsend–Murphy Party. The Eddys and the Kesebergs joined the Breens, attempting to make it over the pass, but they found snowdrifts and were unable to find the trail. They turned back for Truckee Lake and within a day all the families were camped there except for the Donners, who were —half a day&#x27;s journey—below them.

===Winter camp===

Sixty members and associates of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg and Eddy families set up for the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and the Murphys another, and the Reeds and the Graves the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family against the side of the Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over age 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, six of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child and the Donners&#x27; drivers: six men, three women and twelve children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of an eight-day storm.

By the time the party made camp, very little food remained from the supplies that Stanton had brought back from Sutter&#x27;s Fort. The oxen began to die, and their carcasses were frozen and stacked. Truckee Lake was not yet frozen, but the pioneers were unfamiliar with catching lake trout. Eddy, the most experienced hunter, killed a bear, but had little luck after that. The Reed and Eddy families had lost almost everything. Margret Reed promised to pay double when they got to California for the use of three oxen from the Graves and Breen families. Graves charged Eddy $25—normally the cost of two healthy oxen—for the carcass of an ox that had starved to death.

Desperation grew in camp and some reasoned that individuals might succeed in navigating the pass where the wagons could not. In small groups they made several attempts, but each time returned defeated. Another severe storm, lasting more than a week, covered the area so deeply that the cattle and horses—their only remaining food—died and were lost in the snow. Patrick Breen began keeping a diary on November 20. He concerned himself primarily with the weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include religious references in his entries.
Life at Truckee Lake was miserable. The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a &quot;disagreeable&quot; glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay in front of their fireplace, roasted it in the fire and ate it. After a party set out on makeshift snowshoes in an attempt to cross the mountain pass, two-thirds of those remaining at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine. Migrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would be able to make the full-day trek to see the Donners. News came that Jacob Donner and three hired men had died. One of them, Joseph Reinhardt, confessed on his deathbed that he had murdered Wolfinger. George Donner&#x27;s hand had become infected, which left four men to work at the Donner camp.

Margret Reed had managed to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, to the delight of her children, but by January they were facing starvation and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia Reed, Milt Elliott and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning that it would be better to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.

===&quot;The Forlorn Hope&quot;===

The mountain party at Truckee Lake began to fail. Augustus Spitzer and Baylis Williams (a driver for the Reeds) died, more from malnutrition than starvation. Franklin Graves fashioned 14 pairs of snowshoes out of oxbows and hide. On December 16, a party of 17 men, women and children set out on foot in an attempt to cross the mountain pass. As evidence of how grim their choices were, four of the men were fathers. Three of the women, who were mothers, gave their young children to other women. They packed lightly, taking what had become six days&#x27; rations, a rifle, a blanket each, a hatchet and some pistols, hoping to make their way to Bear Valley. Historian Charles McGlashan later called this snowshoe party the &quot;Forlorn Hope&quot;. Two of those without snowshoes, Charles Burger and 10-year-old William Murphy, turned back early on. Other members of the party fashioned snowshoes for 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy on the first evening from one of the packsaddles that they were carrying.

The snowshoes proved to be awkward but effective on the arduous climb. The members of the party were neither well-nourished nor accustomed to camping in snow deep, and by the third day, most were snowblind. On the sixth day, Eddy discovered his wife had hidden a half-pound of bear meat in his pack. The group set out again the morning of December 21; Stanton had been straggling for several days and he remained behind, saying he would follow shortly. His remains were found at that location the following year.

The group became lost and confused. After two more days without food, Patrick Dolan proposed one of them should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt at a lottery. Eddy suggested that they keep moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt. Antonio, the animal handler, was the first to die; Franklin Graves was the next casualty.
As the blizzard progressed, Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, and ran into the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan&#x27;s body. Lemuel&#x27;s sister Sarah tried to feed him some, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy. They dried them to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.

After three days&#x27; rest, they set off again, searching for the trail. Eddy eventually succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began taking apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed murdering Luis and Salvador for food. Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick&#x27;s body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were probably close to death. William Foster shot both men, thus realizing his plans from before they had left; their bodies were butchered and their flesh dried for consumption. Though the murder was not kept secret, Kristin Johnson notes that &quot;Foster was not greatly blamed&quot; for it and spent the rest of his life without being troubled by the authorities—this can be attributed to the general attitude, as expressed by Lewis Petrinovich, that the lives of Native Americans &quot;seemed to matter little&quot;.

Not more than a few days later, the group stumbled into a Native American settlement looking so deteriorated that the camp&#x27;s inhabitants initially fled. The Native Americans gave them what they had to eat: acorns, grass and pine nuts. After a few days, Eddy continued on with the help of tribe members to a ranch in a small farming community at the edge of the Sacramento Valley. A hurriedly assembled rescue party found the other six survivors on January 17. Their journey from Truckee Lake had taken 33 days.

==Rescue==
===Reed attempts a rescue===
James Reed made it out of the Sierra Nevada to Rancho Johnson in late October. He was safe and recovering at Sutter&#x27;s Fort, but each day he became more concerned for the fate of his family and friends. He pleaded with Colonel John C. Frémont to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the party. In return, Reed promised to join Frémont&#x27;s forces and fight in the Mexican–American War. He was joined by McCutchen, who had been unable to return with Stanton, as well as some members of the Harlan–Young Party. The Harlan–Young wagon train had arrived at Sutter&#x27;s Fort on October 8, the last to make it over the Sierra Nevada that season. The party of roughly 30 horses and a dozen men carried food supplies, and expected to find the Donner Party on the western side of the mountain, along the Bear River below the steep approach to Emigrant Gap, perhaps starving but alive. When they arrived in the river valley, they found only a migrant couple who had been separated from their company and were near starvation.

Two guides deserted Reed and McCutchen with some of their horses, but they pressed on farther up the valley to Yuba Bottoms, walking the last mile on foot. Reed and McCutchen stood looking up at Emigrant Gap, only from the top, blocked by snow, possibly on the same day the Breens attempted to lead one last effort to crest the pass from the east. Despondent, they turned back to Sutter&#x27;s Fort.

===First relief===

Much of the military in California were engaged in the Mexican–American War, and with them the able-bodied men. Throughout the region, roads were blocked, communications compromised and supplies unavailable. Only three men responded to a call for volunteers to rescue the Donner Party. Reed was laid over in San Jose until February because of regional uprisings and general confusion. He spent that time speaking with other pioneers and acquaintances. The people of San Jose responded by creating a petition to the United States Navy to assist the people at Truckee Lake. Two local newspapers reported that members of the snowshoe party had resorted to cannibalism, which helped to foster sympathy for those still trapped. Residents of Yerba Buena, many of them recent migrants, raised $1,300 ($ in ) and organized relief efforts to build two camps to supply a rescue party for the refugees.

A rescue party including William Eddy started on February 4 from the Sacramento Valley. Rain and a swollen river forced several delays. Eddy stationed himself at Bear Valley, while the others made steady progress through the snow and storms to cross the pass to Truckee Lake, caching their food at stations along the way so they did not have to carry it all. Three of the rescue party turned back, but seven forged on.

On February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Frémont Pass (now Donner Pass); as they neared where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. A haggard Mrs. Murphy appeared from a hole in the snow, stared at them and asked, &quot;Are you men from California, or do you come from heaven?&quot; The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated migrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the migrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing &quot;such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description&quot;. George Donner&#x27;s arm was so gangrenous he could not move. Twenty-three people were chosen to go with the rescue party, leaving 21 in the cabins at Truckee Lake and twelve at Alder Creek.
The rescuers concealed the fate of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued migrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten. Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a Mason that he would return for her children. Patty told her, &quot;Well, mother, if you never see me again, do the best you can.&quot; Upon their return to the lake, the Breens refused them entry to their cabin, but after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. 

The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child&#x27;s body go. After several days&#x27; more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer&#x27;s pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party&#x27;s surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.

After those rescued migrants made it safely into Bear Valley, William Hook, Jacob Donner&#x27;s stepson, broke into food stores and fatally gorged himself. The others continued to Sutter&#x27;s Fort, where Virginia Reed wrote, &quot;I really thought I had stepped over into paradise&quot;. She was amused to note one of the young men asked her to marry him, although she was only 13 and recovering from starvation, but she turned him down.

===Second relief===

Around the time the first relief party was being organized, nearby California settler and patriarch George C. Yount (who had likely previously heard of the plight of the Donner Party) had distressing dreams of a struggling group of starving pioneers in deep snow. Yount, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo and others then raised five hundred dollars to send out another rescue party.

On March 1, the second relief party arrived at Truckee Lake. Those rescuers included veteran mountain men, notably John Turner, who accompanied the return of Reed and McCutchen. Reed was reunited with his daughter Patty and his weakened son Tommy. An inspection of the Breen cabin found its occupants relatively well, but the Murphy cabin, according to author George R. Stewart, &quot;passed the limits of description and almost of imagination&quot;. Levinah Murphy was caring for her eight-year-old son Simon and the two young children of William Eddy and Foster. She had deteriorated mentally and was nearly blind. The children were listless and had not been cleaned in days. Lewis Keseberg had moved in and could barely move due to an injured leg.

No one at Truckee Lake had died between the departure of the first and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott&#x27;s mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by their father&#x27;s organs. The rescuers discovered three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.

The second relief evacuated 17 migrants from Truckee Lake, only three of whom were adults. Both the Breen and Graves families prepared to go. Only five people remained at Truckee Lake: Keseberg, Mrs. Murphy and her son Simon, and the young Eddy and Foster children. Tamsen Donner elected to stay with her ailing husband after Reed informed her that a third relief party would arrive soon. Mrs. Donner kept her daughters Eliza, Georgia and Frances with her.

The walk back to Bear Valley was very slow. At one point, Reed sent two men ahead to retrieve the first cache of food, expecting the third relief, a small party led by Selim E. Woodworth, to come at any moment. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner&#x27;s feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to move, having not eaten for days. The relief party had no choice but to leave without them. The site where the Breens and Graves had been left became known as &#x27;Starved Camp&#x27;. Margaret Breen reportedly took the initiative to try to keep the members of the camp alive after the others departed down the mountain. However, Elizabeth Graves and her son Franklin soon perished, before the next rescue party could reach them, and the remaining party ate the flesh of their dead bodies to survive. 
Three members of the relief party stayed to help those remaining at the camps: Charles Stone at Truckee Lake, and Charles Cady and Nicholas Clark at Alder Creek. While Clark was out hunting, Stone traveled to Alder Creek and made plans with Cady to return to California. According to Stewart, Tamsen Donner arranged for them to take her daughters Eliza, Georgia and Frances with them, perhaps for $500 cash. Stone and Cady took the three girls to Truckee Lake but left them at a cabin with Keseberg and Levinah Murphy when they started for Bear Valley. Cady recalled later that after two days on the trail they passed Starved Camp, but they did not stop to help. They overtook Reed and the others within days. Several days later, at the Alder Creek camp, Clark and Trudeau agreed to leave for California together. When they reached Truckee Lake and discovered the Donner girls still there, they returned to Alder Creek to inform Tamsen Donner.

William Foster and William Eddy, survivors of the snowshoe party, started from Bear Valley to intercept Reed, taking with them a man named John Stark. After a day, they met Reed helping his children struggle on toward Bear Valley, all frostbitten and bleeding but alive. Desperate to rescue their own children, Foster and Eddy persuaded four men, with pleading and money, to go to Truckee Lake with them. During their journey they found the eleven survivors at Starved Camp, huddled around a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake. Two of the rescuers each took a child and headed back to Bear Valley. John Stark refused to leave the others. He picked up two children and all the provisions and assisted the remaining Breens and Graves to safety, sometimes advancing the children down the trail piece-meal, putting them down and then going back to carry the other debilitated children.

===Third relief===

Foster and Eddy finally arrived at Truckee Lake on March 14, where they found their children dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy&#x27;s son; Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner&#x27;s children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin to see to her daughters. She chose to return to her husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. The third relief left with the Donner girls, young Simon Murphy, Trudeau and Clark. Levinah Murphy was too weak to leave and Keseberg refused.

Two more relief parties were mustered to evacuate any adults who might still be alive. Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month after the third relief left Truckee Lake, the &quot;alcalde&quot; near Sutter&#x27;s Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners&#x27; belongings. Those were sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On their way back to Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said he put a blanket around her and told her to start out in the morning, but she died during the night. The salvage party were suspicious of Keseberg&#x27;s story and found a pot full of human flesh in the cabin along with George Donner&#x27;s pistols, jewelry and $250 in gold. They threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed that he had cached $273 of the Donners&#x27; money, at Tamsen&#x27;s suggestion, so that it could one day benefit her children.

===Response===

News of the Donner Party&#x27;s fate was spread eastward by journalist Samuel Brannan, who ran into the salvage party as they came down from the pass with Keseberg. Accounts of the ordeal first reached New York City in July 1847. Reporting on the event across the U.S. was heavily influenced by the national enthusiasm for westward migration. In some papers, news of the tragedy was buried in small paragraphs, despite the contemporary tendency to sensationalize stories. Several newspapers, including those in California, wrote about the cannibalism in graphic, exaggerated detail. In some accounts, the members of the Donner Party were depicted as heroes and California a paradise worthy of significant sacrifices.

Emigration to the West decreased over the following years, but it is likely that the drop in numbers was caused by fears over the ongoing Mexican–American War. In 1846, an estimated 1,500 people migrated to California. In 1847, the number dropped to 450 and then to 400 in 1848. The California Gold Rush spurred a sharp increase, however: 25,000 people went west in 1849. Most of the overland migration followed the Carson River, but a few forty-niners used the same route as the Donner Party and recorded descriptions of the site.

In June 1847, members of the Mormon Battalion under General Stephen W. Kearny buried the human remains and partially burned two of the cabins. The few who ventured over the pass in the next few years found bones, artifacts and the cabin used by the Reed and Graves families. In 1891, a cache of money was found buried by the lake. It had probably been hastily stored by Mrs. Graves when she left with the second relief so she could return for it later.

Lansford Hastings received death threats for his role in the disaster. A migrant who crossed before the Donner Party confronted him about the difficulties they had encountered, reporting: &quot;Of course he could say nothing but that he was very sorry, and that he meant well.&quot;

===Survivors===
Of the 87 people who entered the Wasatch Mountains, only 48 survived. Only the Reed and Breen families remained intact. The children of Jacob Donner, George Donner, and Franklin Graves were orphaned. William Eddy was alone; most of the Murphy family had died. Only three mules reached California; the remaining animals perished. Most of the Donner Party members&#x27; possessions were discarded.
A few of the widowed women remarried within months; brides were scarce in California. The Reeds settled in San Jose and two of the Donner children lived with them. Reed fared well in the California Gold Rush and became prosperous. Virginia wrote an extensive letter to her cousin in Illinois about &quot;our troubles getting to California&quot;, with editorial oversight from her father. Journalist Edwin Bryant carried it back in June 1847, and it was printed in the &quot;Illinois Journal&quot; on December 16, 1847, with some editorial alterations. Virginia converted to Catholicism, fulfilling a promise she had made to herself while observing Patrick Breen pray in his cabin.

The Murphy survivors settled in Marysville, while the Breens made their way to San Juan Bautista. The Breen family purchased the Castro Adobe in 1848, with a fortune 16-year-old John Breen earned in California&#x27;s Gold country, and operated it as an inn. They became the anonymous subjects of J. Ross Browne&#x27;s story about his severe discomfort upon learning that he was staying with alleged cannibals, printed in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1862. Many of the survivors encountered similar reactions. The Breens&#x27; youngest daughter, Isabella, was one year old during the winter of 1846–1847 and the last survivor of the Donner Party. She died in San Francisco on March 25, 1935.

George and Tamsen Donner&#x27;s children were taken in by an older couple near Sutter&#x27;s Fort. Eliza was three years old during the winter of 1846–1847, the youngest of the Donner children. She published an account of the Donner Party in 1911, based on printed accounts and those of her sisters.
Mary Graves married early, but her first husband was murdered. She cooked his killer&#x27;s food while he was in prison to ensure the condemned man lived long enough to be hanged. One of Mary&#x27;s grandchildren noted she was very serious; she once said, &quot;I wish I could cry but I cannot. If I could forget the tragedy, perhaps I would know how to cry again.&quot; Her brother William had several different occupations, a diverse lifestyle, and his nieces thought he was &quot;eccentric and irascible&quot;. He died in 1907 and was buried in Calistoga. Nancy Graves, who was nine years old during the winter of 1846–1847, refused to acknowledge her involvement in the events. She reportedly was unable to recover from her role in the cannibalism of her mother and brother.

Eddy remarried and started a family in California. He attempted to follow through on his promise to murder Lewis Keseberg but was dissuaded by James Reed and Edwin Bryant. A year later, Eddy recalled his experiences to J. Quinn Thornton, who wrote the earliest account of the episode, also using Reed&#x27;s memories. Eddy died in Petaluma on December 24, 1859.

Keseberg brought a defamation suit against several members of the relief party who accused him of murdering Tamsen Donner. The court awarded him $1 in damages, but made him pay court costs. An 1847 story in the &quot;California Star&quot; described Keseberg&#x27;s actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party. It reported that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses exposed in the spring thaw. Historian Charles McGlashan amassed enough material to indict Keseberg for the murder of Tamsen Donner, but after interviewing him he concluded no murder occurred. Eliza Donner Houghton also believed Keseberg to be innocent. As Keseberg grew older, he did not venture outside as he had become a pariah and was often threatened. He told McGlashan, &quot;I often think that the Almighty has singled me out, among all the men on the face of the earth, in order to see how much hardship, suffering, and misery a human being can bear!&quot;

==Legacy==

The attention directed at the Donner Party is made possible by reliable accounts of what occurred, according to Stewart, and the fact that &quot;the cannibalism, although it might almost be called a minor episode, has become in the popular mind the chief fact to be remembered about the Donner Party. For a taboo always allures with as great strength as it repels.&quot; The appeal is the events focused on families and ordinary people, according to Johnson, writing in 1996, instead of on rare individuals, and that the events are &quot;a dreadful irony that hopes of prosperity, health, and a new life in California&#x27;s fertile valleys led many only to misery, hunger, and death on her stony threshold&quot;.

The site of the cabins became a tourist attraction as early as 1854. In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting the idea of a monument to mark the site. He helped to acquire the land for a monument, and in June 1918 the statue of a pioneer family, dedicated to the Donner Party, was placed on the spot where the Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have stood. It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.

The State of California created the Donner Memorial State Park, surrounding the monument, in 1927. Twenty years later, the site of the Murphy cabin was purchased and added to the park. In 1962, the Emigrant Trail Museum was added to tell the history of westward migration into California. The Murphy cabin and Donner monument were established as a National Historic Landmark in 1963. A large rock served as the back-end of the fireplace of the Murphy cabin, and a bronze plaque has been affixed to the rock listing the members of the party, indicating which survived. The State of California calls the episode &quot;an isolated and tragic incident of American history that has been transformed into a major folk epic&quot;. As of 2003, the park receives an estimated 200,000 visitors a year.

===Mortality===
Most historians count 87 members of the party, although Stephen McCurdy in the &quot;Western Journal of Medicine&quot; includes Sarah Keyes—Margret Reed&#x27;s mother—and Luis and Salvador, bringing the number to 90. Five people had already died before the party reached Truckee Lake: one from tuberculosis (Halloran), three from trauma (Snyder, Wolfinger and Pike), and one from exposure (Hardkoop). A further 34 died between December 1846 and April 1847: twenty-five males and nine females. Several researchers have studied the mortalities to determine what factors may affect survival in nutritionally deprived individuals. Of the 15 members of the snowshoe party, eight of the ten men who set out died, but all five women survived. A professor at the University of Washington stated that the Donner Party episode is a &quot;case study of demographically-mediated natural selection in action&quot;.

The deaths at Truckee Lake, at Alder Creek and in the snowshoe party were probably caused by a combination of malnutrition, overwork and exposure to cold. Several members became more susceptible to infection due to starvation, such as George Donner, but the three most significant factors in survival were age, sex and the size of family group that each traveled with. The survivors were on average 7.5 years younger; children aged between six and 14 had a much higher survival rate than those under the age of six, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Kesebergs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. More than 66 percent of males aged between 20 and 39 died. Men metabolize protein faster; women do not require as high a caloric intake and store more body fat, which delays physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork. Men also tend to take on more dangerous tasks, and in that particular instance, the men were required to engage in heavy labor before reaching Truckee Lake, adding to their physical debilitation. Those traveling with family members had a higher survival rate, possibly because family members more readily shared food.

===Memories and rumors of cannibalism===

Although some survivors disputed the accounts of cannibalism, Charles McGlashan, who corresponded with many of the survivors over a 40-year period, documented many recollections that it occurred. Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan, in his 1879 book &quot;History of the Donner Party&quot;, declined to include some of the more morbid details—such as the suffering of the children and infants before death—or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek. The same year McGlashan&#x27;s book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846–1847) it was given only to the youngest children: &quot;Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else.&quot; She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob&#x27;s wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker. Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.

Archaeological findings at the Alder Creek camp proved inconclusive for evidence of cannibalism. None of the bones tested at the Alder Creek cooking hearth could be identified with certainty as human. According to Rarick, only cooked bones would be preserved, and it is unlikely that the Donner Party members would have needed to cook human bones.

Eliza Farnham&#x27;s 1856 account of the Donner Party was based largely on an interview with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves Jr. and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary&#x27;s father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted that she and her family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick and Joseph King—whose account is sympathetic to the Breen family—do not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, would have survived otherwise. King suggests Farnham included this in her account independently of Margaret Breen.

According to an account published by H. A. Wise in 1847, Trudeau boasted of his own heroism, but also spoke in lurid detail of eating Jacob Donner and said he had eaten a baby raw. Many years later, Trudeau met Eliza Donner Houghton and denied cannibalizing anyone. He reiterated this in an 1891 interview with a St. Louis newspaper. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, despite their circumstances. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau&#x27;s accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners. Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau&#x27;s interview with Wise to be a result of &quot;common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one&#x27;s elders&quot;; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton. Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart&#x27;s characterization &quot;extravagant moralism&quot;, particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices. Ethan Rarick echoed this: &quot;more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous&quot;.

<text>A cheese blintzes or blintz (; ) is a rolled filled pancake in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, in essence a wrap based on a &quot;crepe&quot; or Russian &quot;blini&quot;. The corresponding Russian dish is called &quot;blinchiki&quot;, literally &quot;little &quot;blini&quot;&quot;.

==History==
Traditional blintzes are filled with sweetened cheese, sometimes with the addition of raisins, or fruit preserves and then slightly sautéed. They are served on Shavuot.
The word &quot;blintz&quot; in English comes from the Yiddish word or , coming from a Slavic word &quot;блинец [blin-yets]&quot; meaning &quot;blin&quot;, or pancake.

Like the knishes, blintzes represent foods that are now considered typically Jewish, and exemplify the changes in foods that Jews adopted from their Christian neighbors.

For Passover, matzo meal is used instead of flour.

<doc id="268991" wikidata="Q964107" url="?curid=268991" title="Chow mein">
<text>Chow mein ( and , ; Pinyin: &quot;chǎomiàn&quot;) is a dish of Chinese stir-fried noodles with vegetables and sometimes meat or tofu. Over the centuries, variations of &quot;chǎomiàn&quot; were developed in many regions of China; there are several methods of frying the noodles and a range of toppings can be used. It was introduced in other countries by Chinese immigrants. The dish is popular throughout the Chinese diaspora and appears on the menus of most Chinese restaurants abroad. It is particularly popular in India, Nepal, the UK, and the US.

==Etymology== 
&#x27;Chow mein&#x27; is the Americanization of the Chinese term &quot;chaomian&quot; (). Its pronunciation comes from the Cantonese pronunciation &quot;chaomin&quot;; the term first appeared in English (US) in 1906. The term &#x27;chow mein&#x27; means &#x27;stir-fried noodles&#x27;, also loosely translated as &quot;fried noodles&quot; in English, &quot;chow&quot; () meaning &#x27;stir-fried&#x27; (or &quot;sautéed&quot;) and &quot;mein&quot; () meaning &quot;noodles&quot;.

==Regional cuisine==

===American Chinese cuisine===

Chaomian was introduced from China into the United States by Chinese immigrants who came from the Guangdong provinces in the California gold rush era, bringing their Cantonese style of cooking.

In American Chinese cuisine, it is a stir-fried dish consisting of noodles, meat (chicken being most common but pork, beef, shrimp or tofu sometimes being substituted), onions and celery. It is often served as a specific dish at westernized Chinese restaurants. Vegetarian or vegan chow mein is also common.

In the American market, two types of chow mein include crispy chow mein and steamed chow mein.

The steamed chow mein has a softer texture, while the former is crisper and drier. Crispy chow mein uses fried, flat noodles, while soft chow mein uses long, rounded noodles.

Crispy chow mein either has onions and celery in the finished dish or is served &quot;strained&quot;, without any vegetables. Steamed chow mein can have many different kinds of vegetables in the finished dish, most commonly including onions and celery but sometimes carrots, cabbage and mung bean sprouts as well. Crispy chow mein is usually topped with a thick brown sauce, while steamed chow mein is mixed with soy sauce before being served.

There is a regional difference in the US between the East and West Coast use of the term &quot;chow mein&quot;. On the East Coast, &quot;chow mein&quot; is always the crispy kind. At some restaurants located in those areas, the crispy chow mein noodles are sometimes deep fried and could be crispy &quot;like the ones in cans&quot; or &quot;fried as crisp as hash browns&quot;. At a few East Coast locations, &quot;chow mein&quot; is also served over rice. There, the steamed style using soft noodles is a separate dish called &quot;lo mein&quot;. On the West Coast, &quot;chow mein&quot; is always the steamed style, and the term &quot;lo mein&quot; is not widely used.

The crispy version of chow mein can also be served in a hamburger-style bun as a chow mein sandwich.

There are also variations on how either one of the two main types of chow mein can be prepared as a dish. When ordering &quot;chow mein&quot; in some restaurants in Chicago, a diner might receive &quot;chop suey poured over crunchy fried noodles&quot;. In Philadelphia, Americanized chow mein tends to be similar to chop suey but has crispy fried noodles on the side and includes much celery and bean sprouts and is sometimes accompanied with fried rice. Jeremy Iggers of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; describes &quot;Minnesota-style chow mein&quot; as &quot;a green slurry of celery and ground pork topped with ribbons of gray processed chicken&quot;. Bay Area journalist William Wong made a similar comment about what is sold as chow mein in places like Minnesota. A published recipe for Minnesota-style chow mein includes generous portions of celery and bean sprouts. Another Minnesotan variant includes ground beef and cream of mushroom soup. In Louisiana, &quot;Cajun chow mein&quot; is actually a noodle-less rice dish that is a variation of jambalaya.

Food historians and cultural anthropologists have noted that chow mein and other dishes served in Chinese American restaurants located away from areas without any significant Asian American population tend to be very different from what is served in China and are heavily modified to fit the taste preference of the local dominant population. As an example, the chow mein gravy favored in the Fall River area more closely resembles that used in local New England cooking than that used in traditional Chinese cooking. The creator of canned chow mein, who founded the food manufacturer Chun King, admits to using Italian spices to make his product more acceptable to Americans whose ancestors came from Europe.
In 1946, one of the first companies to market &quot;chow mein&quot; in a can was Chun King. The product&#x27;s creator was Jeno Paulucci, the son of Italian immigrants, who developed a recipe based mostly upon Italian spices that would be better catered to the food preferences of European immigrants and some Americans of similar ethnic origins. To keep cost down, Paulucci replaced expensive water chestnuts with lower-cost celery stalks that were originally destined for cattle feed. Paulucci&#x27;s company became so successful selling canned chow mein and chop suey that President Gerald Ford quipped, &quot;What could be more American than a business built on a good Italian recipe for chop suey?&quot; when praising Paulucci&#x27;s accomplishments with Chun King. After Paulucci sold Chun King in 1966, the company was sold several more times more until it was dissolved in 1995.

By 1960, Paulucci told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;At Chun King we have turned out a &#x27;stew-type&#x27; chow mein. I&#x27;d guess this type has been around for thirty—maybe forty—years. To make it, all the meat, seasonings and vegetables are dumped into a kettle and stewed for hours—until everything is cooked.&quot;

Outside of Chinese restaurants, what is labeled as chow mein is frequently a chop suey-like stew that has little resemblance to actual chow mein. For example, the official U.S. military recipe (employed by cooking facilities of all four American military services) does not include noodles, comes with instructions to serve the dish over steamed rice, and can serve 100 persons per batch.

===Australian cuisine===
Outside of Asian communities, many Australians appear to confuse chow mein with chop suey. The most common Australian version contains minced beef (called ground beef in North America) and curry powder and sometimes served over rice instead of fried noodles. This version has been promoted by the Australian Institute of Sport, on ABC radio, and a popular Australian women&#x27;s magazine since the mid-1960s and during the 21st century.

===Canadian Chinese cuisine===
Canadian westernized Chinese restaurants may offer up to three different types of chow mein, none of which is identical to either of the two types of American chow mein. &quot;Cantonese style chow mein&quot; contains deep-fried crunchy golden egg noodles, green peppers, pea pods, bok choy, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, shrimp, Chinese roast pork (&quot;char siu&quot;), chicken, and beef, and is served in a thick sauce. Plain &quot;chow mein&quot; is similar to other Western chow meins, but contains far more mung bean sprouts; some regional recipes may substitute bean sprouts for noodles completely. The Japanese Canadian community also have their own version of chow mein that might include dried seaweed and pickle ginger and could be served in a bun.

In Newfoundland, their chow mein does not contain any noodles. In place of noodles, cabbage cut in such a way to resemble noodles are used as a substitute. Although no one knows the reason why this change had occurred, it is believed that the island&#x27;s remoteness in the North Atlantic during its history as an independent self-governing British dominion contributed to the lack of availability of the necessary ingredients from the rest of North America or from Europe.

===Caribbean Chinese cuisine===

Many West Indian people include chow mein in their cuisine, especially peoples from islands like Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica which include a significant ethnic Chinese population; much of the cooking has infused itself into the population in general. As well, in the South American Caribbean countries Guyana and Suriname (known by its Dutch name &quot;tjauw min&quot; or &quot;tjauwmin&quot;). These chow mein dishes are cooked in a similar manner, with green beans, carrots, peas, onions and sometimes other vegetables. Meat used is mostly chicken but sometimes pork or shrimp. The Surinamese version may use a pork sausage as the meat. The main difference is that local spices are added, and the dish is often served with hot Scotch bonnet peppers or pepper sauce.

In Cuba, aside from the foreign-owned tourist hotels which often serve Western-style Chinese food, local Chinese restaurants can be found in Havana that offer a distinct Cuban style.

===Central America===
In Panama, chow mein is prepared with a mixture of onions, peppers, celery and carrots with pork or chicken and stir fried with noodles. Another recipe includes canned corn. In El Salvador, chow mein may contain carrots, cabbage or broccoli. In Guatemala, chow mein (or chao mein) is usually prepared with chayote and carrots and served on a corn tostada.

===Indian Chinese cuisine===

Chow mein is also common in Indian Chinese. In India, it was introduced by the Chinese of Calcutta. It is usually offered &quot;Hakka&quot;-style, with gravy. Catering to vegetarian diets, there is an Indian variant, vegetable chow mein, which consists of noodles with cabbage, bamboo shoots, pea pods, green peppers, and carrots. In the New Delhi area, chow mein can sometimes include paneer with the mixture of noodles and vegetables. Another non-meat Indian variant includes scrambled egg as a protein source. Kolkata has its own variant that is called &quot;Calcutta Chow Mein&quot; or &quot;Calcutta Chowmin&quot; that also includes green chilli, chilli garlic, or hot garlic. The Pakistani version includes carrots, cabbage, peppers, spring onions, chilies, and ginger garlic paste.

===Indonesian Chinese cuisine===
There are two Indonesian versions of chow mein. One is &quot;Mie goreng&quot;, which is (sometimes spicy) stir-fried noodle dish with variants of toppings, and the other is a crispy noodle dish topped with sauce that is pretty popular and existed in virtually all Chinese restaurant in Indonesia. It goes popular with the name of I fu mie or &quot;Mi Siram&quot;, literally means drenched noodle, in Indonesian Chinese cuisine. In Indonesia, i fu mie is usually served with thick egg sauce with cauliflower, broccoli, mushroom, kekkian or prawn cake, and chicken. Several varieties does exists such as vegetarian and seafood that contains squid, prawn and fish instead of kekkian. The dish is often confused with Lo mein.

=== Mauritian cuisine ===
In Mauritius, Mauritian chow mein is known as &quot;mine frire&quot;, &quot;mine frite&quot;, &quot;mine frit&quot; and &quot;minn frir&quot;. The term is a combination of Cantonese/Hakka word for noodles &quot;mein&quot; () and french word for &quot;fried&quot;. It was likely introduced in Mauritius by Chinese immigrants who mostly came from the Southeast part of China (mostly from the Cantonese regions) at the end of the 19th century. It was mainly eaten by the Chinese community who settled in Mauritius and eventually evolved in a distinctively Mauritian dish diverging from the original recipe. It is a classical Sino-Mauritian dish which is eaten by all Mauritians regardless of ethnicity, reflecting the influence of Chinese and Sino-Mauritian community despite being one the smallest community on the island. It is a very common street food and can be found in almost all restaurants on the island.

===Mexican Chinese cuisine===
Chow mein has gained popularity in Mexico, which received waves of Chinese immigrants in the past, particularly in northwestern Mexico. Mexicali, a city in Baja California, is known for its distinct style of chow mein, which typically use Mexican ingredients as substitutes for traditional Chinese ones, an adaption that was made by Chinese immigrants settling the area.

===Nepalese cuisine===

Tibetans who settled in Nepal brought chow mein with them. It is a popular fast food in Nepal. The Newari people of the Kathmandu Valley use water buffalo meat and chicken in their cuisine, and chow mein in Nepal is often cooked with onion, vegetables and buff (water buffalo meat).

===Peruvian Chinese cuisine===
Chinese food (&quot;chifa&quot;) is very popular in Peru and is now a part of mainstream Peruvian culture. Chow mein is known to Peruvians as &quot;tallarín saltado&quot; (&quot;sautéed noodles&quot;) and may contain peppers, onions, green onions, and tomatoes. Chicken or beef are the preferred meats used in this Peruvian variant.

<doc id="268993" wikidata="Q568532" url="?curid=268993" title="MGM Resorts International">
<text>MGM Resorts International is an American multinational hospitality, sports and entertainment company. It operates resorts in Las Vegas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Maryland, Ohio, New Jersey, Macau, Shanghai, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Sanya, including the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand and Park MGM.

The company began operations in 1987 as MGM Grand, Inc. and became MGM Mirage in 2000, after acquiring Mirage Resorts. In the mid-2000s, growth of its non-gaming (lodging, food, retail) revenue began to outpace gaming receipts and demand for high-rise condominiums was surging, with median property prices in Las Vegas twice the national average. The company shifted its focus from owning and operating resorts and casinos to developing and building real estate in the leisure and gaming industry—launching the massive CityCenter mixed-use project, which was at the time of its construction the world&#x27;s largest construction site and ranks as one of the most expensive real estate projects in history. City Center&#x27;s development coincided with the global financial crisis, causing more than $1 billion in writedowns in its valuation.

Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corporation were, until 2009, the majority shareholders of MGM Mirage; Kerkorian was the former owner of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio, from which MGM Grand derived its name. Following a $1 billion stock offering by MGM Mirage amidst the global credit crunch, Tracinda&#x27;s shares were diluted from 53.8 percent to 39 percent. On June 15, 2010, shareholders voted for MGM Mirage to change its name to &quot;MGM Resorts International&quot;.

In 2015, the company split into two forming MGM Growth Properties, a real estate company, while MGM Resorts shifted to operating properties. Today, MGM Resorts is the largest casino company in the world by revenue, making $13.13 billion USD in revenue in 2022.

==History==
===Background and early ventures (1969–1988)===
The company&#x27;s background can be traced to 1969, when airline and casino tycoon Kirk Kerkorian bought a controlling stake in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) film studio. In 1970 and 1971, Kerkorian struggled with debt from his acquisitions of MGM and Western Airlines, and was forced to sell a majority of his casino company, International Leisure, to Hilton Hotels at a steep discount. When the Las Vegas Hilton, the casino he had built, subsequently became the most successful hotel in Las Vegas, Kerkorian was inspired to lead the studio into the gambling industry. It opened the original MGM Grand Hotel and Casino (now Horseshoe Las Vegas) in 1973. The MGM Grand Reno followed in 1978.

By 1979, the two hotel-casinos accounted for most of MGM&#x27;s income, and the company announced a plan to split itself in two. The next year, the film studio was spun off as a new company, while the original company, renamed as MGM Grand Hotels Inc., retained the two hotel-casinos. Kerkorian held a 47 percent stake in both companies.

In 1985, Kerkorian began seeking a buyer for MGM Grand Hotels, to allow him to concentrate on running United Artists and on developing new properties under the MGM Grand name. A deal was reached for Bally Manufacturing to buy the company; the deal closed in April 1986, and the two casinos were renamed under the Bally&#x27;s brand. The terms of the sale allowed Kerkorian to retain rights to the MGM Grand name, and plans were announced to offer the stockholders of MGM Grand Hotels shares in a new company that would hold the naming rights.

The company now known as MGM Resorts International was formed in 1986 as Grand Name Co. as a subsidiary of Kerkorian&#x27;s Tracinda Corporation. It was renamed in 1987 as MGM Grand, Inc.

The company&#x27;s first venture was MGM Grand Air, a luxury airline offering service between New York and Los Angeles, which launched in September 1987. The company also made an offer to take over financially struggling Pan American World Airways, but this offer was rejected by Pan Am&#x27;s board in November 1987.

In August 1987, MGM Grand bid $152 million for the bankrupt Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas, but was beat out by Japanese billionaire Masao Nangaku. Instead, the company acquired the Desert Inn and Sands casinos in February 1988 from Summa Corporation for $167 million. The Sands was sold to Sheldon Adelson&#x27;s Interface Group for $110 million in April 1989.

===First casino developments (1989–1999)===
In September 1989, the company announced plans for a $700-million Hollywood-themed complex, including a 4,000-room hotel and a theme park. The Desert Inn site was initially considered as a location for the project, but within weeks the location was finalized as the Marina Hotel and Casino and the Tropicana Country Club, which MGM Grand acquired for $93 million plus $30 million in stock. The company put the Desert Inn up for sale to focus efforts on the new project, but found no outside bidders, and agreed to sell it to Tracinda for $130 million. Construction on the MGM Grand Las Vegas and the MGM Grand Adventures theme park began in October 1991, and the property opened in December 1993 at a final cost of $1 billion. The park permanently closed in 2002 due to a lack of interest.

The company moved its headquarters from Beverly Hills to Las Vegas in July 1992.

During construction of the MGM Grand, the company acquired an option to buy an 18-acre site across the street from the project. Gary Primm of Primadonna Resorts approached MGM president Bob Maxey in 1994 with an idea for the site: a casino recreating the New York skyline. A joint venture was formed between the two companies, and construction began in March 1995. Completed at a cost of $460 million, the New York-New York Hotel and Casino opened in January 1997.

With New York-New York under development, MGM Grand made moves to expand in several other markets. An exploratory agreement to develop two casinos on the Chinese island of Hainan was announced in August 1994, but came to nothing. In Darwin, Australia, a lucrative market attracting high rollers from Pacific Rim countries, the company considered building a hotel, but instead bought the Diamond Beach Hotel and Casino, renaming it as the MGM Grand Darwin. MGM announced plans for an Atlantic City casino in July 1996. In Michigan, where voters approved casinos in November 1996, MGM made plans for a bid on one of the three available gaming licenses, which would eventually be approved and open in July 1999 as the MGM Grand Detroit.

In South Africa, with casino gambling newly authorized, MGM announced plans in August 1996 to develop 15 properties in conjunction with Tsogo Sun. The first, a temporary casino in Johannesburg&#x27;s Sundome, opened in October 1998. Three more casinos followed before MGM agreed to sell out its interest in the properties to Tsogo Sun in November 2001.

Since the initiation of New York-New York, analysts had speculated that MGM Grand or Primadonna would buy out the other&#x27;s interest in the project. Instead of making such a cash-intensive purchase, however, MGM agreed to buy Primadonna outright for $276 million in stock plus $336 million in assumed debt. The merger closed in March 1999, giving MGM ownership of three casinos and two golf courses at the Nevada–California state line, in addition to full control of New York-New York.

===Mirage Resorts merger (2000)===
In February 2000, MGM Grand made an unsolicited offer of $17 a share to buy Mirage Resorts, which had floundered due to disappointing results at its new Beau Rivage and Bellagio resorts. Analysts expected a protracted battle, with Mirage founder Steve Wynn seen as unwilling to give up control but under pressure from institutional investors. Mirage rejected the offer, but Wynn met with Kerkorian the next day and named a price of $21 a share. The companies agreed on the higher price, for a total of $4.4 billion plus $2 billion in assumed debt. The merger closed in May 2000, giving MGM ownership of the Mirage, Treasure Island, Bellagio, Boardwalk, and Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas, the Golden Nugget in Laughlin, and the Beau Rivage in Mississippi, and a half share of the Monte Carlo. The company changed its name to MGM Mirage in August 2000. Mirage had also owned a half stake in the Borgata, a planned casino in Atlantic City, in a joint venture managed by Boyd Gaming. Work on the Borgata continued apace, and it would open in July 2003.

===Stalled developments (2001–2004)===
In 2001 and 2002, following the merger with Mirage, the company explored options for its next major development project, including in the Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Chicago, and Macau markets. The 55-acre site of the Boardwalk casino on the Las Vegas Strip was earmarked for a technologically advanced megaresort targeting a Generation X demographic. In Atlantic City, MGM shifted focus from its previously announced boardwalk site to a proposed billion-dollar hotel and casino on a 55-acre tract adjacent to the Borgata, where Wynn had planned to build the Le Jardin casino. In the Chicago market, MGM agreed to pay $600 million to buy the unfinished Emerald Casino in Rosemont, Illinois, whose investors had been accused of ties to organized crime. The deal was rejected, however, by state gaming regulators, and MGM then backed off its effort, saying that Illinois&#x27;s casino tax was too high. In Macau, where Stanley Ho&#x27;s 40-year government-granted monopoly on gambling was coming to an end, MGM submitted a bid for one of three available gaming concessions, but it was not selected, losing out to Ho, Las Vegas Sands, and Wynn Resorts.

MGM made moves into the United Kingdom market after a 2001 government report called for loosening of the country&#x27;s gambling regulations. It opened an online casino, playmgmmirage.com, licensed in the Isle of Man, a British dependency, and it applied for a license to run an online sports betting site in the U.K. It acquired a twenty-five percent stake in a company developing the small Triangle Casino in Bristol, which went on to open its doors in February 2004. It inked deals to build casinos at the Olympia Exhibition Centre in London, St James&#x27; Park in Newcastle, Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield, the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, Sportcity in Manchester, Glasgow Harbour, King&#x27;s Waterfront in Liverpool, and at a proposed stadium in Salford. The company also signed a $490-million deal to acquire Wembley plc, owner of seven greyhound tracks in Britain and four in the United States.

The British expansion plans ultimately amounted to nothing. MGM closed its online casino after less than two years, citing uncertainty in American regulations and competition from established British brands. The Wembley acquisition turned into a bidding war, with MGM finally losing out to an investors group including Kerzner International. The Triangle Casino was sold off to Stanley Leisure in 2006. The company&#x27;s other development plans were scuttled as the government scaled down, and eventually abandoned, the plan to allow large &quot;super-casinos&quot;.

In 2004, the company disposed of some of its smaller properties, selling the two Golden Nugget casinos (Golden Nugget Las Vegas and Golden Nugget Laughlin) to Poster Financial Group for $215 million, and the MGM Grand Darwin to Skycity Entertainment for $140 million.

===Mandalay merger (2004–2005)===
MGM entered into quiet merger talks with Mandalay Resort Group in early 2004. The potential acquisition would give MGM control of more than half the hotel rooms on the Las Vegas Strip. Mandalay assets attractive to MGM included low-end casinos like Excalibur and Circus Circus to broaden MGM&#x27;s &quot;high roller&quot; appeal; the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, which would allow MGM to compete directly with the Sands Expo center in the convention market; and at least two prime developable sites on the Strip. The talks went public in June, when MGM announced an offer worth $7.65 billion. Mandalay rejected that offer because of a clause allowing MGM to back out if antitrust regulators demanded the sale of any properties. Analysts speculated that another bidder such as Harrah&#x27;s or Boyd might enter, but none did, and MGM and Mandalay soon agreed on a $7.9 billion deal.

MGM executives were confident that antitrust regulators would not require the sale of any of the two companies&#x27; properties. Michigan law, however, forbade one company from owning multiple casinos, requiring the sale of either the MGM Grand Detroit or Mandalay&#x27;s 54 percent stake in the MotorCity Casino. After some vacillation about which property to sell, Mandalay accepted a $525-million offer for its interest in MotorCity from Marian Ilitch, the casino&#x27;s second largest shareholder. Meanwhile, in Illinois, where MGM needed regulatory approval to take over Mandalay&#x27;s 50 percent interest in the Grand Victoria Casino, a lack of quorum on the state Gaming Board threatened to delay the merger. MGM considered a sale to the casino&#x27;s other owner, the Pritzker family, but ultimately gained approval for a plan to place the property under control of a trustee until completion of the licensing process. The FTC approved the merger as predicted, and MGM obtained a $7 billion line of credit to finance it. The sale closed on April 25, 2005 for a total of $7.9 billion, including $3 billion in assumed debt.

The Mandalay acquisition made MGM Mirage the largest gaming company in the world, but it was surpassed just two months later when Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment acquired Caesars Entertainment in a deal that had been spurred on by news of the MGM-Mandalay merger.

===Later developments (2004–2006)===

Despite MGM&#x27;s initial failure to win a gaming concession in Macau, the company had remained interested in the burgeoning gaming market. Rumors of a possible partnership with Stanley Ho were reported in 2003, but Nevada gaming regulators informally vetoed the idea because of the alleged involvement of organized crime triads in his casinos. Another possibility emerged when the government allowed the three gaming concessionaires to each sell a sub-concession. In June 2004, MGM formed a joint venture with Pansy Ho, Stanley&#x27;s daughter, to develop a casino-hotel under a sub-concession from Stanley. Despite initial concerns about whether Pansy Ho was subject to her father&#x27;s influence, the Nevada Gaming Commission eventually approved the partnership. Construction of the MGM Grand Macau began in June 2005. The property opened in December 2007, completed at a cost of $1.25 billion.

In 2004, MGM solidified its plans for the Boardwalk site on the Strip, announcing Project CityCenter, an $8-billion high-density project including hotels, condominiums, a casino, and a shopping mall. The Boardwalk was closed in January 2006 to make way for the redevelopment, and CityCenter construction began the following June.

Singapore emerged in 2004 as the next major new Asian gaming market, calling for proposals to build two &quot;integrated resort&quot; casinos at Marina Bay and the island of Sentosa. MGM partnered with CapitaLand in an estimated $3 billion bid for the Marina Bay site. Their bid advanced to the final stage against three competitors, and was seen as the favorite to win. The government awarded the license, however, to Las Vegas Sands, citing its strength in the meetings and conventions sector.

In 2007, MGM Mirage disposed of some outlying properties in Southern Nevada. The two Laughlin casinos (the Colorado Belle and Edgewater) were sold for $200 million, the Primm Valley Resorts were sold for $400 million, and the Nevada Landing Hotel and Casino was closed.

===Dubai World investment (2007–2009)===
On April 19, 2007 the company announced that it planned to purchase a site from Concord Wilshire Partners for $130 million and a site from Gordon Gaming for $444 million. The two parcels give the company complete control of the southwest corner of the Sahara and Las Vegas Boulevard intersection. When combined with underused parts of the Circus Circus site, the company will have a site for future development. The Concord site had been the proposed location for the Maxim Casino.

On August 22, 2007, Dubai World said it would buy a 9.5 percent stake in MGM for about $2.4 billion. It would also invest about $2.7 billion to acquire a 50 percent stake in MGM&#x27;s CityCenter project. Dubai World would pay MGM Mirage an additional $100 million if the project opened on time and on budget. The investment firm would buy 14.2 million shares from MGM Mirage. The firm would also issue a public tender for an additional 14.2 million shares at the same price.

On October 29, 2008, MGM Mirage halted a $5 billion Atlantic City project on land next to the Borgata.

At about the same time, New Jersey gambling regulators were evaluating MGM Mirage&#x27;s suitability to operate casinos in New Jersey, and were unconvinced that MGM Mirage&#x27;s Macau partner, Pansy Ho, could operate independently from influence of her father, Stanley Ho. The latter was often accused of ties with Chinese organized crime and letting the gangs operate in his casinos&#x27; VIP rooms. Faced with not complying with New Jersey gaming regulations, MGM Mirage decided to divest the highly profitable Borgata in order to continue pursuing the even more lucrative Chinese market. MGM Mirage subsequently transferred its 50% share in the Borgata to a divestiture trust through which it received all benefit of the ownership. The trust was responsible for selling MGM&#x27;s interest within 30 months, although MGM had the right to direct the trustee during the first 18 months.

On December 16, 2008, MGM Mirage announced the sale of its Las Vegas Treasure Island resort and casino to billionaire Phil Ruffin. The sale was completed on March 20, 2009 for $600 million in cash plus a $175 million promissory note.

On March 23, 2009 Dubai World and Infinity World announced that they had filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court seeking to be released from their CityCenter joint venture agreement with MGM Mirage after the company filed its annual report stating that &quot;there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,&quot; and &quot;it cannot provide assurance that its business would generate sufficient cash flow from operation.&quot;

Starting on April 6, 2009 news reports surfaced that MGM Mirage had hired investment firm Morgan Stanley to assist the company in finding possible buyers for the MGM Grand Detroit and the Beau Rivage.

===Name change and recent years (2010–present)===
In June 2010, MGM Mirage changed its name to &quot;MGM Resorts International&quot;, to emphasize the brand&#x27;s global scope and increased non-gaming strategy.

In May 2011 an initial public offering was held for the MGM Macau property through a new holding company, MGM China. MGM retained a 51 percent interest in the company, with Pansy Ho holding a 29 percent stake, and 20 percent sold to public investors for $1.5 billion. In January 2013, MGM China received government approval to build its second resort in Macau.

The offering raised $1.05 billion, and left MGM Resorts with 76 percent ownership of the REIT. In June 2016, MGM announced a joint venture with Sydell Group to renovate and rebrand the Monte Carlo as the Park MGM, named after the adjacent dining and entertainment district, The Park, that opened in April 2016.

As a result of the cyberattack, multiple class action lawsuits were filed against MGM Resorts as well as Caesars Entertainment, which Scattered Spider had hacked into during the same month, with all stating that the failure for both of the casino operators to adequately secure their data constituted breach of contract.

==== Escape Solar + Storage ====
In September, 2024, the company contracted with Escape Solar for the Escape Solar + Storage project, to be operated by Estuary Power.

BetMGM would follow this deal with multiple betting partnerships with other NFL teams, including the Detroit Lions, Las Vegas Raiders, Tennessee Titans, and Pittsburgh Steelers. In late 2020 through early 2021, BetMGM continued to develop its partnership library with other teams in other leagues, including the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL, Washington Nationals of MLB, and Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA, as well as with other business ventures like TopGolf to extend the company&#x27;s brand image to new bettors in operating markets.

==Staff and management==

Sanders, chief operating officer; and John McManus, executive vice president, general counsel and secretary.

The company has received wide recognition for its diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as: 40 Best Companies for Diversity (Black Enterprise Magazine), Top 10 Companies for Latinos (DiversityInc Magazine), Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality (Human Rights Campaign Foundation), Top 10 Regional Companies(DiversityInc) and Top Corporation for Women&#x27;s Business Enterprises (Women&#x27;s Business Enterprise National Council). &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named MGM Resorts one of the World&#x27;s Most Admired Companies in 2017.

==Controversy==
MGM Resorts International received criticism for filing a lawsuit on July 18, 2018, against survivors and relatives of victims slain in the October 1, 2017 Las Vegas shooting. MGM has claimed that, because it utilized the security services of Contemporary Services Corporation, a vendor certified by the Department of Homeland Security at the time of the October 1 shooting, any proceedings should be held in federal court where MGM is shielded from liability by the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act, also known as the Safety Act. MGM said they are insured for $751 million towards the settlement of the lawsuit which MGM believes will be settled in May 2020. Robert Englet, an attorney to some of the survivors, describes the countersuit as an attempt to get a more favorable judge. Brian Claypool, another attorney of the survivors&#x27;, called the lawsuits a “public relations nightmare”. MGM&#x27;s controversial action prompted a public outcry from survivors of the shooting, family members of the victims, lawmakers, and media members in New York State urging the New York State Gaming Commission to block MGM from completing its $850 million deal to purchase Empire City Casino and Yonkers Raceway in Yonkers, New York, which deal had been scheduled to close in January 2019. In October 2019, MGM agreed to pay victims and survivors up to $800 million.

==Awards and recognition==
The company continues to receive wide recognition for its diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as: 40 Best Companies for Diversity (&quot;Black Enterprise Magazine&quot;) in 2012, Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality (Human Rights Campaign Foundation) in 2013, Top 10 Regional Companies (&quot;DiversityInc&quot;) in 2014, Top 10 Companies for Latinos (&quot;DiversityInc Magazine&quot;), and top 100 Companies for MBA Students (Universum Global) in 2014. &quot;Fortune&quot; has named MGM Resorts one of the World&#x27;s Most Admired Companies.

<doc id="268996" wikidata="Q7522698" url="?curid=268996" title="Sing Pao Daily News">
<text>Sing Pao Daily News () is one of the oldest Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, first published on 1 May 1939 by the Sing Pao Newspaper Company Limited () under Ho Man-fat. It was initially published every three days, later becoming a daily.

By the 1950s, Sing Pao accounted for almost half of the market.

In 2003, the paper had a circulation of 100,000, reaching over 220,000 readers, the company says.

==Sections==

&quot;Sing Pao&quot; consists of various sections: 
*Local – This section contains Hong Kong headlines, an editorial column, local news and related softnews, as well as a complaints board.
*International (including PRC and Taiwan) – This section consists of international news, news from China, amusing international softnews, and profiles of international leaders.
*Economics – In this section, one can find Economic headlines, news on Chinese Business, finance information, investment tips, and information on the property market.
*Entertainment – In this section, there is wide coverage of local and international entertainment news.
*Sports – This section focuses on football news, including football-gambling, NBA, and other news.
*Horse-racing
*Supplementary sections, including Holiday, Foods and Drinks, Cars, Mobile phones, Computers and Software, Fashion and Beauty, Health, and Education.

&quot;Sing Pao&quot; especially targets teenagers and it has many school subscriptions. It has an editorial section for students, where young readers can summit their essays. The Teacher and Student Corner covers education in Hong Kong, ranging from kindergarten to tertiary institutions.

The paper includes Weekly International News Highlights and a Corner about the Hong Kong Legislative Council, giving a quick overview of current affairs and offering a space for readers to express their views.

==Improvement in technology==

Sing Pao&#x27;s PDA Channel allows download the latest news (including politics, current affairs, international affairs, entertainment, and even horse-racing information) from the official Sing Pao website.

==Financial problems and ownership==
In 2000, amid declining sales, founder Ho Man-fat sold Sing Pao to Optima Media Holding (the purchaser was also stated as StarEastNet Limited () and China Strategic Holdings Limited ()) for HK$150 million. In 2004, that company was itself bought and renamed Strategic Media International. At the time of the sale, it was announced that the reporting style would remain the same, but the main focus would shift to entertainment news and advertising. Chief executive officer Ng-Ching is targeting the Chinese market to expand its advertising revenue.
The newspaper was in financial troubles again in early 2006, during which it was unable to pay employee salaries on time. Eventually, in May 2004, twenty-three of its reporters – led by Kwok Yin-Ling (?) (郭燕玲), the assistant chief editor – took sick leave together as a measure/protest against the management. However, no agreement could be reached and the reporters ultimately resigned. Some top-level executives (and board members?) resigned after this incident. As of June 2006, at least 60 employees have left Sing Pao, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority is suing Sing Pao because of all the MPF Sing Pao has not paid, and the Labour Department is suing Sing Pao because of the unpaid wages.

The Labour Department won and on 3 January 2007, Sing Pao was fined HK$4200. The media and the head of the Labour Department criticised the punishment as being too light. In face of the criticism, the magistrate reopened the case on his own initiative the next day, as authorised by law (Chapter 227, Section 104(5)). With the Magistrates&#x27; Courts, there is no functus officio: a magistrate can reopen his own case within 14 days. This led to other people criticising the magistrate&#x27;s decision to reopen, saying it gives the impression of popular and executive interference in the judiciary.

In April 2015, the paper faced further difficulties, as creditor Korchina Culture filed a &#x27;statutory demand notice&#x27; leading Sing Pao to seek a loan of HK$110 million. Amid the troubles, the paper ceased publication for several weeks from 17 July, and on 12 August the High Court ruled that the paper&#x27;s indebted parent company, Sing Pao Media Enterprises, must be liquidated. With this move, the paper&#x27;s immediate future was secure and publication continued.

==Reliability and criticism==
Although Sing Pao has a motto of reporting the truth fairly and objectively, it has faced criticism too. On 4 February 2003, a reader complained to the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) that Sing Pao published the full name, address and picture of a victim in their paper, which violated their personal privacy.

Near the end of the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, Johnny Lau Yui-siu (劉銳紹), a pundit who wrote a critique of both Henry Tang and Leung Chun-ying for the &quot;Sing Pao Daily News&quot;, complained that the journal of &quot;unfairly editing and distorting his column&quot;, turning his article into one favouring Leung. Lau said that his intended piece was entitled &quot;Neither Tang nor Leung is worthy of support&quot;. In the piece, he opined that &quot;supporting either party would not be conducive to the situation&quot;, but the published version read: &quot;If there is really a need to make a choice, then, let&#x27;s choose Mr Leung Chun-ying.&quot; Lau alleged that his conclusion was similarly distorted: &quot;neither Mr Tang nor Mr Leung is worthy of support. They do not deserve sympathy either&quot; was changed to read: &quot;Mr Tang is not worthy of support. Nor does he deserve sympathy.&quot; Ngai Kai-kwong, editor-in-chief of &quot;Sing Pao&quot; said: &quot;the editing might have been too carelessly done.&quot; He denied the paper had exercised censorship, nor that it had come under pressure from the central government&#x27;s liaison office. Citing format and budget reasons, Sing Pao dropped Lau&#x27;s column alone in April. However, the HKJA rejected this explanation, and suggested that the cause was Lau&#x27;s mourning of a deceased Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi in his column, which triggered a blockage of access to Sing Pao&#x27;s online version in mainland.

<doc id="268997" wikidata="Q1151968" url="?curid=268997" title="History of the Republic of China">
<text>The history of the Republic of China began in 1912 with the end of the Qing dynasty, when the Xinhai Revolution and the formation of the Republic of China put an end to 2,000 years of imperial rule. The Republic experienced many trials and tribulations after its founding which included being dominated by elements as disparate as warlord generals and foreign powers.

In 1928, the Republic was nominally unified under the Kuomintang (KMT; also called &quot;Chinese Nationalist Party&quot;) after the Northern Expedition, and was in the early stages of industrialization and modernization when it was caught in the conflicts involving the Kuomintang government, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), local warlords, and the Empire of Japan. Most nation-building efforts were stopped during the full-scale Second Sino-Japanese War against Japan from 1937 to 1945, and later the widening gap between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party made a coalition government impossible, causing the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, in 1946, shortly after the Japanese surrender to the Allied Powers in September 1945.

A series of political, economic and military missteps led to the KMT&#x27;s defeat and its retreat to Taiwan (formerly &quot;Formosa&quot;) in 1949, where it established an authoritarian one-party state under Generalissimo/President Chiang Kai-shek. This state considers and until the 1990s actively asserted itself to be the continuing sole legitimate ruler of all of China, referring to the communist government or &quot;regime&quot; as illegitimate, a so-called &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (PRC) declared in Beijing by Mao Zedong in 1949, as &quot;mainland China&quot; and &quot;communist bandit&quot;. The Republic of China was supported for many years – even decades – by many nations, especially the United States who established a 1954 Mutual Defense treaty. After political liberalization began in the late 1960s, the PRC was able – after a constant yearly campaign in the United Nations – to finally get approval in 1971 to take the seat for &quot;China&quot; in the General Assembly, and more importantly, be seated as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. After recovering from this shock of rejection by its former allies and liberalization in the late 1970s from the Nationalist authoritarian government and following the death of Chiang Kai-shek, the Republic of China has transformed itself into a multiparty, representative democracy on Taiwan and given more representation to those native Taiwanese, whose ancestors predate the 1949 mainland evacuation.

==Provisional Government (1912)==

===Founding of the republic===


The Qing dynasty in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was challenged by civil unrest and foreign invasions ever since they lost the Sino-Japanese War in 1895. Internal rebellions and their repression brought millions of deaths, conflicts with foreign Western European powers brought humiliating unequal treaties, exacted reparations that burdened the fiscal system, and compromised the country&#x27;s territorial integrity. Popular sentiment among Han Chinese grew that political power should return to the majority Han Chinese from the minority Manchus. Following the Boxer Rebellion and the invasion of the imperialist powers to put it down, the Qing Imperial Court launched fundamental institutional and political reforms, such as abolishing the Imperial examination system in 1905, drafting a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909, and the preparations for electing a national parliament in 1910. However, Manchu conservatives in the Qing Court thought these reforms went too far and distrustful critics felt they did not go far enough. Reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The failures of the Imperial Court to enact such political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to take the road of revolution.

There were many revolutionary groups, but the most organized one was founded by Sun Yat-sen (), a republican and anti-Qing activist who became increasingly popular among overseas Chinese and Chinese students abroad, especially in Japan. In 1905 Sun founded the Tongmenghui in Tokyo with Huang Xing, a popular leader of the Chinese revolutionary movement in Japan, as his deputy.

This movement, generously supported by overseas Chinese funds, also gained political support with regional military officers and some of the reformers who had fled China after the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform. Sun&#x27;s political philosophy was conceptualized in 1897, first enunciated in Tokyo in 1905 and modified through the early 1920s. It centered on the Three Principles of the People: &quot;nationalism, democracy, and people&#x27;s livelihood&quot;.

The principle of nationalism called for overthrowing the Manchus and ending foreign hegemony over China. The second principle, democracy, was used to describe Sun&#x27;s goal of a popularly elected republican form of government and changes such as land reform. 

The Republican Era of China began with the outbreak of revolution on 10 October 1911, in Wuchang, the capital of Hubei Province, among discontented modernized army units whose anti-Qing plot had been uncovered. This would be known as the Wuchang Uprising, which is celebrated as Double Tenth Day in Taiwan. It had been preceded by numerous abortive uprisings and organized protests inside China. The revolt quickly spread to neighboring cities, and Tongmenghui members throughout the country rose in support of the Wuchang revolutionary forces. On 12 October, the Revolutionaries succeeded in capturing Hankou and Hanyang. However, the euphoria engendered by this victory was short-lived. On 27 October, Yuan Shikai was reappointed by the Qing Court to lead the New Army, and loyalist forces under Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui moved south to retake Wuhan. After heavy fighting in November, the out-manned and out-gunned Revolutionary Army was driven out of Hankou and Hanyang, and retreated to Wuchang south of the Yangtze. During the 41-day Battle of Yangxia, however, 15 of the 24 provinces had declared their independence from the Qing empire. Yuan Shikai halted his army&#x27;s advance on Wuchang and began to negotiate with the revolutionaries. A month later, Sun Yat-sen returned to China from the United States, where he had been raising funds among Chinese and American sympathizers.

On 1 January 1912, delegates from the independent provinces elected Sun Yat-sen as the first Provisional President of the Republic of China. Yuan Shikai agreed to accept the Republic and forced the last emperor of China, Puyi, to abdicate on 12 February. Empress Dowager Longyu signed the abdication papers. Puyi was allowed to continue living in the Forbidden City, however. The Republic of China officially succeeded the Qing Dynasty.

==Beiyang era (1912–1928)==
===Early republic===
On 1 January 1912, Sun officially declared the establishment of the Republic of China and was inaugurated in Nanjing as the first Provisional President. However, power in Beijing already had passed to Yuan Shikai, who had effective control of the Beiyang Army, the most powerful military force in China at the time. To prevent civil war and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic, Sun agreed to Yuan&#x27;s demand for China to be united under a Beijing government headed by him. On 10 March, in Beijing, Yuan Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.

The republic which Sun Yat-sen and his associates envisaged evolved slowly. Although there were many political parties vying for supremacy in the legislature, the revolutionists lacked an army, and soon Yuan Shikai&#x27;s power began to outstrip that of parliament. Yuan revised the constitution on his own and became dictatorial. In August 1912 the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) was founded by Song Jiaoren, one of Sun&#x27;s associates. It was an amalgamation of small political groups, including Sun&#x27;s Tongmenghui. In the national elections held in February 1913 for the new bicameral parliament, Song campaigned against the Yuan administration, whose representation at the time was largely by the Republican Party, led by Liang Qichao. Song was an able campaigner and the Kuomintang won a majority of seats.

===Journalism===

The overthrow of the old imperial regime in 1911 produced a surge in Chinese nationalism, an end to censorship, and a demand for professional, nation-wide journalism. All the major cities launched such efforts. Special attention was paid to China&#x27;s role in the World War, to the disappointing Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and to the aggressive demands and actions of Japan against Chinese interests. Journalists created professional organizations, and aspired to separate news from commentary. At the Press Congress of the World conference in Honolulu in 1921, the Chinese delegates were among the most Westernized and self-consciously professional journalists from the developing world. By the late 1920s, however, there was a much greater emphasis on advertising and expanding circulation, and much less interest in the sort of advocacy journalism that had inspired the revolutionaries.

===Second Revolution===

Song was assassinated in March 1913. Some people believe that Yuan Shikai was responsible, and although it has never been proven, he had already arranged the assassination of several pro-revolutionist generals. Animosity towards Yuan grew. In April he secured a reorganization loan of 25 million pounds sterling from a coalition of banks from Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany and Japan, without consulting the parliament first. The loan was used to finance Yuan&#x27;s Beiyang Army.

On 20 May, Yuan concluded a deal with Russia that granted Russia special privileges in Outer Mongolia and restricted Chinese rights to station troops there. Kuomintang members of the Parliament accused Yuan of abusing his rights and called for his removal. On the other hand, the Progressive Party (), which was composed of constitutional monarchists and supported Yuan, accused the Kuomintang of fomenting an insurrection. Yuan then decided to use military action against the Kuomintang.

In July 1913 seven southern provinces rebelled against Yuan, beginning the Second Revolution (). There were several underlying reasons for the Second Revolution besides Yuan&#x27;s abuse of power. First was that most Revolutionary Armies from different provinces were disbanded after the establishment of the Republic of China, and many officers and soldiers felt that they were not compensated for toppling the Qing Dynasty. These factors gave rise to much discontent against the new government among the military. Secondly, many revolutionaries felt that Yuan Shikai and Li Yuanhong were undeserving of the posts of presidency and vice presidency, because they acquired the posts through political maneuvering rather than participation in the revolutionary movement. Lastly, Yuan&#x27;s use of violence (such as Song&#x27;s assassination) dashed the Kuomintang&#x27;s hope of achieving reforms and political goals through electoral means.

However, the Second Revolution did not fare well for the Kuomintang. The leading Kuomintang military force of Jiangxi was defeated by Yuan&#x27;s forces on 1 August and Nanchang was taken. On 1 September, Nanjing was taken. When the rebellion was suppressed, Sun and other instigators fled to Japan. In October 1913 an intimidated parliament formally elected Yuan Shikai President of the Republic of China, and the major powers extended recognition to his government. Duan Qirui and other trusted Beiyang generals were given prominent positions in the cabinet. To achieve international recognition, Yuan Shikai had to agree to autonomy for Outer Mongolia and Tibet. China was still to be suzerain, but it would have to allow Russia a free hand in Outer Mongolia and Tanna Tuva and Britain continuation of its influence in Tibet.

===Mass banditry, Yuan Shikai and the National Protection War===
Bandit leaders with popular movements instigated revolts, with the support of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s revolutionaries from Canton. The bandit-led Bai Lang Rebellion ransacked and destroyed much of central China before it was crushed by the Beiyang Army of Yuan Shikai, the Muslim Ma clique and Tibetan militia. These bandits were associated with the Gelaohui.

In November Yuan Shikai, legally president, ordered the Kuomintang dissolved and forcefully removed its members from parliament. Because the majority of the parliament members belonged to the Kuomintang, the parliament did not meet quorum and was subsequently unable to convene. In January 1914 Yuan formally suspended the parliament. In February he called into session a meeting to revise the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, which was announced in May of that year. The revision greatly expanded Yuan&#x27;s powers, allowing him to declare war, sign treaties and appoint officials without seeking approval from the legislature first. In December 1914 he further revised the law and lengthened the term of the President to ten years, with no term limit. Essentially, Yuan was preparing for his ascendancy as the emperor.

On the other hand, since the failure of the Second Revolution, Sun Yat-sen and his allies were trying to rebuild the revolutionary movement. In July 1914 Sun established the Chinese Revolutionary Party (). He felt that his failures at building a consistent revolutionary movement stemmed from the lack of cohesiveness among its members. To that end, Sun required that party members to be totally loyal to Sun and follow a series of rather harsh rules. Some of his earlier associates, including Huang Xing, balked at the idea of such authoritarian organization and refused to join Sun. However, they agreed that the republic must not revert to imperial rule.

Besides the revolutionary groups associated with Sun, there were also several other groups aimed at toppling Yuan Shikai. One was the Progressive Party, the original constitutional-monarchist party that opposed the Kuomintang during the Second Revolution. The Progressive Party switched their position largely because of Yuan&#x27;s sabotage of the national parliament. Secondly, many provincial governors who had declared their independence from the Qing Imperial Court in 1912 found the idea of supporting another Imperial Court utterly ridiculous. Yuan also alienated his Beiyang generals by centralizing tax collection from local authorities. In addition, public opinion was overwhelmingly anti-Yuan.

When World War I broke out in 1914, Japan fought on the Allied side and seized German holdings in Shandong Province. In 1915 the Japanese set before the government in Beijing the so-called Twenty-One Demands, aimed at securing Japanese economic controls in railway and mining operations in Shandong, Manchuria and Fujian. The Japanese also pressed to have Yuan Shikai appoint Japanese advisors to key positions in the Chinese government. The Twenty-One Demands would have made China effectively a Japanese protectorate. The Beijing government rejected some of these demands but yielded to the Japanese insistence on keeping the Shandong territory already in its possession. Beijing also recognized Tokyo&#x27;s authority over southern Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. Yuan&#x27;s acceptance of the demands was extremely unpopular, but he continued his monarchist agenda nevertheless.

On 12 December 1915 Yuan, supported by his son Yuan Keding, declared himself emperor of a new Empire of China. This sent shock waves throughout China, causing widespread rebellion in numerous provinces. On 25 December former Yunnan governor Cai E, former Jiangxi governor Li Liejun () and Yunnan Gen. Tang Jiyao formed the National Protection Army () and declared Yunnan independent. Thus began the National Protection War ().

Yunnan&#x27;s declaration of independence also encouraged other southern provinces to declare theirs. Yuan&#x27;s Beiyang generals, who were already wary of his imperial coronation, did not put up an aggressive campaign against the National Protection Army. On 22 March 1916 Yuan formally repudiated monarchy and stepped down as the first and last emperor of his dynasty. He died on 6 June of that year. Vice President Li Yuanhong assumed the presidency and appointed Beiyang Gen. Duan Qirui as his Premier. Yuan Shikai&#x27;s imperial ambitions finally ended with the return of republican government.

===Warlord Era (1916–1928)===


After Yuan Shikai&#x27;s death, shifting alliances of regional warlords fought for control of the Beijing government. Despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in Beijing during the warlord era, this did not constitute a new era of control or governance, because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves. These military-dominated governments were collectively known as the Beiyang Government. The warlord era is considered by some historians to have ended in 1927.

===World War I and brief Manchu restoration===

After Yuan Shikai&#x27;s death, Li Yuanhong became the President and Duan Qirui became the Premier. The Provisional Constitution was reinstated and the parliament convened. However, Li Yuanhong and Duan Qirui had many conflicts, the most glaring of which was over China&#x27;s entry into World War I. Since the outbreak of the war, China had remained neutral until the United States urged all neutral countries to join the Allies, as a condemnation of Germany&#x27;s use of unrestricted submarine warfare. Premier Duan Qirui was particularly interested in joining the Allies as an opportunity to secure loans from Japan to build up his Anhui clique army. The two factions in the parliament engaged in ugly debates regarding the entry of China and, in May 1917, Li Yuanhong dismissed Duan Qirui from his government.

This led provincial military governors loyal to Duan to declare independence and to call for Li Yuanhong to step down as president. Li Yuanhong summoned Zhang Xun to mediate the situation. Zhang Xun had been a general serving the Qing Court and was by this time the military governor of Anhui province. He had his mind on restoring Puyi (Xuantong Emperor) to the imperial throne. Zhang was supplied with funds and weapons through the German legation, which was eager to keep China neutral.

On 1 July 1917, Zhang officially proclaimed the restoration of Qing dynasty and requested that Li Yuanhong give up his presidency, which Li promptly rejected. Duan Qirui led his army and defeated Zhang Xun&#x27;s restoration forces in Beijing. One of Duan&#x27;s airplanes bombed the Forbidden City, in what was possibly the first aerial bombardment in East Asia. On July 12 Zhang&#x27;s forces disintegrated and Duan returned to Beijing.

The Manchu restoration ended almost as soon as it began. During this period of confusion, Vice President Feng Guozhang, also a Beiyang general, assumed the post of Acting President of the republic and took his oath of office in Nanjing. Duan Qirui resumed his post as the Premier. The Zhili clique of Feng Guozhang and the Anhui clique of Duan Qirui emerged as the most powerful cliques following the restoration affair.

Duan Qirui&#x27;s triumphant return to Beijing essentially made him the most powerful leader in China. Duan dissolved the parliament upon his return and declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary on 14 August 1917. German and Austro-Hungarian nationals were detained and their assets seized. Around 175,000 Chinese workers volunteered for labor battalions after being enticed with money, some even years before war was declared. They were sent to the Western Front, German East Africa and Mesopotamia and served on supply ships. Some 10,000 died, including over 500 on ships sunk by U-boats. No soldiers were sent overseas, though they did participate with the Allies in the Siberian Intervention under Japanese General Kikuzo Otani.

===Constitutional Protection War===
In September Duan&#x27;s complete disregard for the constitution caused Sun Yat-sen, Cen Chunxuan and the deposed parliament members to establish a new government in Guangzhou and the Constitutional Protection Army () to counter Duan&#x27;s abuse of power. Ironically, Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s new government was not based on the Provisional Constitution; rather, it was a military government and Sun was its &quot;Grand Commander of the Armed Forces&quot; (, translated in the Western press as &quot;Generalissimo&quot;). Six southern provinces became part of Sun&#x27;s Guangzhou military government and repelled Duan&#x27;s attempt to destroy the Constitutional Protection Army.

The Constitutional Protection War continued through 1918. Many in Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Guangzhou government felt his position as the Generalissimo was too exclusionary and promoted a cabinet system to challenge Sun&#x27;s ultimate authority. As a result, the Guangzhou government was reorganized to elect a seven-member cabinet system, known as the Governing Committee. Sun was once again sidelined by his political opponents and military strongmen. He left for Shanghai following the reorganization. Duan Qirui&#x27;s Beijing government did not fare much better than Sun&#x27;s. Some generals in Duan&#x27;s Anhui Clique and others in the Zhili clique did not want to use force to unify the southern provinces. They felt negotiation was the solution to unify China and forced Duan to resign in October. In addition, many were distressed by Duan&#x27;s borrowing of huge sums of Japanese money to fund his army to fight internal enemies.

President Feng Guozhang, with his term expiring, was then succeeded by Xu Shichang, who wanted to negotiate with the southern provinces. In February 1919 delegates from the northern and southern provinces convened in Shanghai to discuss postwar situations. However, the meeting broke down over Duan&#x27;s taking out Japanese loans to fund the Anhui Clique army, and further attempts at negotiation were hampered by the May Fourth Movement. The Constitutional Protection War essentially left China divided along the north–south border.

===May Fourth Movement===
In 1917 China declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost province, then under Japanese control. On 4 May 1919, there were massive student demonstrations against the Beijing government and Japan. The political fervor, student activism and iconoclastic and reformist intellectual currents set in motion by the patriotic student protest developed into a national awakening known as the May Fourth Movement.

The intellectual milieu in which the May Fourth Movement developed was known as the New Culture Movement and occupied the period 1917–1923. The student demonstrations of 4 May 1919, were the high point of the New Culture Movement, and the terms are often used synonymously. Chinese representatives refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles due to intense pressure from both the student protesters and public opinion.

===Fight against warlordism and the First United Front===
The May Fourth Movement helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 Sun Yat-sen had become commander-in-chief of a rival military government in Canton in collaboration with southern warlords. In October 1919 he re-established the Kuomintang (KMT) to counter the government in Beijing. The latter, under a succession of warlords, still maintained its facade of legitimacy and its relations with the West.

By 1921 Sun had become president of the southern government. He spent his remaining years trying to consolidate his regime and achieve unity with the north. His efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were fruitless, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. For political expediency, though, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
In 1922 the Kuomintang-warlord alliance in Guangzhou was ruptured, and Sun fled to Shanghai. By then he saw the need to seek Soviet support for his cause. In 1923 a joint statement by Sun and a Soviet representative in Shanghai pledged Soviet assistance for China&#x27;s national unification. Soviet advisers—the most prominent of whom was an agent of the Comintern, Mikhail Borodin—began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the Kuomintang along the lines of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and establish the First United Front. The CCP was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the Kuomintang, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their party identities to form a &quot;bloc within.&quot;

The policy of working with the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek had been recommended by the Dutch Communist Henk Sneevliet, chosen in 1923 to be the Comintern representative in China due to his revolutionary experience in the Dutch Indies, where he had a major role in founding the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI), and who felt that the Chinese communist party was too small and weak to undertake a major effort on its own.

The CCP was still small at the time, having a membership of just 300 in 1921 and only 1,500 by 1925. By contrast, the Kuomintang in 1922 already had 150,000 members. Soviet advisers also helped the Kuomintang set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 sent Chiang Kai-shek, one of Sun&#x27;s lieutenants from Tongmenghui days, for several months&#x27; military and political study in Moscow. After Chiang&#x27;s return in late 1923, he participated in the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy outside Guangzhou, which was the seat of government under the Kuomintang-CCP alliance. In 1924 Chiang became head of the academy and began the rise to prominence that would make him Sun&#x27;s successor as head of the Kuomintang and the unifier of all China under the right-wing Nationalist Government.

===Chiang consolidates power===

Sun Yat-sen died of cancer in Beijing in March 1925, as the Nationalist movement he had helped to initiate was gaining momentum. During the summer of 1925 Chiang, as commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army, set out on the long-delayed Northern Expedition against the northern warlords. Within nine months half of China had been conquered. By 1926, however, the Kuomintang had divided into left- and right-wing factions, and the Communist bloc within it was also growing.

In March 1926, after thwarting a kidnapping attempt against him (Zhongshan Warship Incident), Chiang abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers, imposed restrictions on CCP members&#x27; participation in the top leadership and emerged as the pre-eminent Kuomintang leader. The Soviet Union, still hoping to prevent a split between Chiang and the CCP, ordered Communist underground activities to facilitate the Northern Expedition, which was finally launched by Chiang from Guangzhou in July 1926.

In early 1927 the Kuomintang-CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the Kuomintang decided to move the seat of the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Chiang, whose Northern Expedition was proving successful, set his forces to destroying the Shanghai CCP apparatus and established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing in the Shanghai massacre of 1927. There now were three capitals in China: the internationally recognized warlord regime in Beijing; the Communist and left-wing Kuomintang regime at Wuhan; and the right-wing civilian-military regime at Nanjing, which would remain the Kuomintang capital for the next decade.

The Comintern cause appeared bankrupt. A new policy was instituted calling on the CCP to foment armed insurrections in both urban and rural areas in preparation for an expected rising tide of revolution. Unsuccessful attempts were made by Communists to take cities such as Nanchang, Changsha, Shantou and Guangzhou, and an armed rural insurrection, known as the Autumn Harvest Uprising, was staged by peasants in Hunan province. The insurrection was led by Mao Zedong, who would later become chairman of the CCP and head of state of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In mid-1927, however, the CCP&#x27;s fortunes were at a low ebb. The Communists had been expelled from Wuhan by their left-wing Kuomintang allies, who in turn were toppled by a military regime. By 1928 all of China was at least nominally under Chiang&#x27;s control, and the Nanjing government received prompt international recognition as the sole legitimate government of China. The Kuomintang government announced that in conformity with Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s formula for the three stages of revolution—military unification, political tutelage and constitutional democracy—China had reached the end of the first phase and would embark on the second, which would be under Kuomintang direction.

==Nationalist era (1928–1949)==
===Nanjing decade (1928–1937)===

The &quot;Nanjing Decade&quot; of 1928-37 was one of consolidation and accomplishment under the leadership of the Nationalists, with a mixed but generally positive record in the economy, social progress, development of democracy and cultural creativity. Some of the harsh aspects of foreign concessions and privileges in China were moderated through diplomacy. In May 1930 the government regained the right to set its tariff, which before then had been set by the foreign powers.
The Nationalist Government also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems, stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production. On 3 November 1935, the government instituted the fiat currency (&quot;fapi&quot;) reform, immediately stabilizing prices and also raising revenues for the government. Great strides also were made in education and, in an effort to help unify Chinese society, in a program to popularize Modern Standard Chinese and overcome other varieties of Chinese. Newspapers, magazines and book publishing flourished, and the widespread establishment of communications facilities further encouraged a sense of unity and pride among the people.

Laws were passed and campaigns mounted to promote the rights of women. A generation of educated and professional new women emerged after the inclusion of girls in the state school system and after women students were admitted at the University of Beijing in 1920, and in the 1931 Civil Code, women were given equal inheritance rights, banned forced marriage and gave women the right to control their own money and initiate divorce.
No nationally unified women&#x27;s movement could organize until China was unified under the Kuomintang Government in Nanjing in 1928; women&#x27;s suffrage was finally included in the new Constitution of 1936, although the constitution was not implemented until 1947. 

The ease and speed of communication also allowed a focus on social problems, including those of the villages. The Rural Reconstruction Movement was one of many which took advantage of the new freedom to raise social consciousness. On the other hand, political freedom was considerably curtailed because of the Kuomintang&#x27;s one-party domination through &quot;political tutelage&quot; and often violent means in shutting down anti-government protests.

During this time, a series of massive wars took place in western China, including the Kumul Rebellion, the Sino-Tibetan War and the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang. Although the central government was nominally in control of the entire country during this period, large areas of China remained under the semi-autonomous rule of local warlords, provincial military leaders or warlord coalitions. Nationalist rule was strongest in the eastern regions around the capital Nanjing, but regional militarists such as Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan retained considerable local authority. The Central Plains War in 1930, the Japanese aggression in 1931 and the Red Army&#x27;s Long March in 1934 led to more power for the central government, but there continued to be foot-dragging and even outright defiance, as in the Fujian Rebellion of 1933–34.

===Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)===

Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese desires on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of Manchuria on 18 September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor Puyi as head of the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932. The loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The League of Nations, established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance.

The Japanese began to push from south of the Great Wall into northern China and the coastal provinces. Chinese fury against Japan was predictable, but anger was also directed against Chiang and the Nanjing government, which at the time was more preoccupied with anti-Communist extermination campaigns than with resisting the Japanese invaders. The importance of &quot;internal unity before external danger&quot; was forcefully brought home in December 1936, when Chiang Kai-shek, in an event now known as the Xi&#x27;an Incident, was kidnapped by Zhang Xueliang and forced to ally with the Communists against the Japanese in the Second Kuomintang-CCP United Front against Japan.

The Chinese resistance stiffened after 7 July 1937, when a clash occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops outside Beijing (then named Beiping) near the Marco Polo Bridge. This skirmish led to open, though undeclared, warfare between China and Japan. Shanghai fell after a three-month battle during which Japan suffered extensive casualties, both in its army and navy. The capital of Nanjing fell in December 1937. It was followed by an onslaught of mass murders and rapes known as the Nanjing Massacre. The national capital was briefly at Wuhan, then removed in an epic retreat to Chongqing, the seat of government until 1945. In 1940 the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime was set up with its capital in Nanjing, proclaiming itself the legitimate &quot;Republic of China&quot; in opposition to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government, though its claims were significantly hampered due to its nature as a Japanese puppet state controlling limited amounts of territory, along with its subsequent defeat at the end of the war.

The United Front between the Kuomintang and CCP took place with salutary effects for the beleaguered CCP, despite Japan&#x27;s steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions and the rich Yangtze River Valley in central China. After 1940 conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the areas not under Japanese control. The entrance of the United States into the Pacific War after 1941 changed the nature of their relationship. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants and the spread of their organizational network, while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence. Meanwhile, northern China was infiltrated politically by Japanese politicians in Manchukuo using facilities such as Wei Huang Gong.

In 1945 the Republic of China emerged from the war nominally a great military power but actually a nation economically prostrate and on the verge of all-out civil war. The economy deteriorated, sapped by the military demands of foreign war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation and by Nationalist profiteering, speculation and hoarding. Starvation came in the wake of the war, and millions were rendered homeless by floods and the unsettled conditions in many parts of the country. The situation was further complicated by an Allied agreement at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 that brought Soviet troops into Manchuria to hasten the termination of war against Japan. Although the Chinese had not been present at Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to have the Soviets enter the war in the belief that the Soviet Union would deal only with the Kuomintang government.

After the end of the war in August 1945, the Nationalist Government moved back to Nanjing. With American help, Nationalist troops moved to take the Japanese surrender in North China. The Soviet Union, as part of the Yalta agreement allowing a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, dismantled and removed more than half the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese. The Soviet presence in northeast China enabled the Communists to move in long enough to arm themselves with the equipment surrendered by the withdrawing Japanese army. The problems of rehabilitating the formerly Japanese-occupied areas and of reconstructing the nation from the ravages of a protracted war were staggering.

===Chinese Civil War (1946–1949)===

During World War II the United States emerged as a major player in Chinese affairs. As an ally it embarked in late 1941 on a program of massive military and financial aid to the hard-pressed Nationalist Government. In January 1943 the United States and Britain led the way in revising their treaties with China, bringing to an end a century of unequal treaty relations. Within a few months a new agreement was signed between the United States and the Republic of China for the stationing of American troops in China for the common war effort against Japan. In December 1943 the Chinese Exclusion Acts of the 1880s and subsequent laws enacted by the United States Congress to restrict Chinese immigration into the United States were repealed.

The wartime policy of the United States was initially to help China become a strong ally and a stabilizing force in postwar East Asia. As the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists intensified, however, the United States sought unsuccessfully to reconcile the rival forces for a more effective anti-Japanese war effort. Toward the end of the war, United States Marines were used to hold Beiping (Beijing) and Tianjin against a possible Soviet incursion, and logistic support was given to Kuomintang forces in north and northeast China.

Through the mediating influence of the United States a military truce was arranged in January 1946, but battles between the Kuomintang and Communists soon resumed. Public opinion of the administrative incompetence of the Republic of China government was escalated and incited by the Communists in the nationwide student protest against mishandling of a rape accusation in early 1947 and another national protest against monetary reforms later that year. Realizing that no American efforts short of large-scale armed intervention could stop the coming war, the United States withdrew the American mission, headed by Gen. George Marshall, in early 1947. The Chinese Civil War became more widespread; battles raged not only for territories but also for the allegiance of cross-sections of the population. The United States aided the Nationalists with massive economic loans and weapons but no combat support.

Belatedly, the Republic of China government sought to enlist popular support through internal reforms. The effort was in vain, however, because of rampant government corruption and the accompanying political and economic chaos. By late 1948 the Kuomintang position was bleak. The demoralized and undisciplined Kuomintang troops proved to be no match for the motivated and disciplined Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army, earlier known as the Red Army. The Communists were well established in the north and northeast.

Although the Kuomintang had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons, controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the long war with Japan and in-fighting among various generals. They were also losing the propaganda war to the Communists, with a population weary of Kuomintang corruption and yearning for peace.

In January 1949 Beiping was taken by the Communists without a fight, and its name changed back to Beijing. Between April and November, major cities passed from Kuomintang to Communist control with minimal resistance. In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. Finally, on 1 October 1949, Communists founded the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

After 1 October 1949 Chiang Kai-shek and a few hundred thousand Republic of China troops and two million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from mainland China to the island of Taiwan; there remained in China itself only isolated pockets of resistance. On 7 December 1949 Chiang proclaimed Taipei, Taiwan, the temporary capital of the Republic of China.

During the civil war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities with millions of non-combatants killed by both sides during the civil war. Benjamin Valentino has estimated atrocities in the Chinese Civil War resulted in the death of between 1.8 million and 3.5 million people between 1927 and 1949. Atrocities include deaths from forced conscription and massacres.

==Authoritarian era (1949–1991)==

===Cross-straits relations and international position in 1949–1970===

At the end of 1943 the Cairo Declaration was issued, including among its clauses that all territories of China—including Formosa (Taiwan)—that Japan had occupied would be returned to the Republic of China. This was reiterated in the Potsdam Declaration, issued in 1945. Later that year World War II ended, and Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, surrendering unconditionally. The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces ordered that Japanese forces in Taiwan surrender to the government of the Republic of China, which acted as a representative of allied powers. The United States and the United Kingdom—the other two participants of the Cairo Declaration—however, regard that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration are merely statements of intention and have no binding force of law.

On 25 October 1945, in Taipei Zhongshan Hall, the Japanese government in Taiwan surrendered to Chen Yi, the representative of the Republic of China, which was the representative of the Allied Powers. The Republic of China started to administer Taiwan. In 1951 Japan formally signed the Treaty of San Francisco but, due to the unclear situation of the Chinese civil war, the peace treaty did not clearly indicate to whom Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty belonged. In the second article of the 1952 Treaty of Taipei, following the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan reiterated its abandonment of sovereignty of Taiwan, the Pescadores, the Spratlys and the Paracels in the Treaty of San Francisco.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) continued a state of war until 1979. In October 1949 a PRC attempt to take the ROC-controlled island of Kinmen was thwarted in the Battle of Kuningtou, halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan. The Communists&#x27; other amphibious operations of 1950 were more successful: they led to the Communist conquest of Hainan Island in April 1950,
capture of Wanshan Islands off the Guangdong coast (May–August 1950) and of Zhoushan Island off Zhejiang (May 1950).

In June 1949 the ROC declared a &quot;closure&quot; of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure covered from a point north of the mouth of the Min River in Fujian province to the mouth of the Liao River in Manchuria. Since mainland China&#x27;s railroad network was underdeveloped, north–south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen.

After losing mainland China, a group of approximately 12,000 KMT soldiers escaped to Burma and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China. Their leader, Gen. Li Mi, was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of Yunnan. Initially the United States supported these remnants and the Central Intelligence Agency provided them with aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the United Nations in 1953, however, the U.S. began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954 nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li Mi declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times.

During the Korean War, some captured Communist Chinese soldiers, many of whom were originally KMT soldiers, were repatriated to Taiwan rather than mainland China. A KMT guerrilla force continued to operate cross-border raids into southwestern China in the early 1950s. The ROC government launched a number of air bombing raids into key coastal cities of mainland China such as Shanghai.

Though viewed as a military liability by the United States, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in Fujian as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On 3 September 1954, the First Taiwan Strait Crisis began when the PLA started shelling Quemoy and threatened to take the Dachen Islands. On 20 January 1955, the PLA took nearby Yijiangshan Island, with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the United States Congress passed the Formosa Resolution authorizing the President to defend the ROC&#x27;s offshore islands. The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the Bandung Conference.

The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis began on 23 August 1958, with air and naval engagements between the PRC and the ROC military forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of Quemoy (by the PRC) and Amoy (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year. PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands, keeping out ROC supply ships. Though the United States rejected Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided amphibious assault ships to land supplies, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7 the United States escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing. On October 25 the PRC announced an &quot;even-day ceasefire&quot; — the PLA would only shell Quemoy on odd-numbered days. Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war.

After the 1950s, the &quot;war&quot; became more symbolic than real, represented by on again, off again artillery bombardment towards and from Kinmen. In later years, live shells were replaced with propaganda sheets. The bombardment finally ceased in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the United States.

During this period, movement of people and goods virtually ceased between PRC- and ROC-controlled territories. There were occasional defectors. One high-profile defector was Justin Yifu Lin, who swam across the Kinmen strait to mainland China on 17 May 1979, and ended up serving as Chief Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank from 2008 to 2012.

Most observers expected Chiang&#x27;s government to eventually fall in response to a Communist invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang&#x27;s government in its final stand. Things changed radically with the onset of the Korean War in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President Harry S. Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent the ROC and PRC from attacking each other.

After the ROC complained to the United Nations against the Soviet Union supporting the PRC, the UN General Assembly Resolution 505 was adopted on 1 February 1952 to condemn the Soviet Union.

===Tensions between Mainlanders and people of Taiwan===
After World War II, General Order No. 1 ordered the forces of the Empire of Japan in Taiwan to surrender to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The Republic of China appointed Chen Yi as the Chief Executive of Taiwan. He arrived in Taiwan on 24 October 1945 and received the last Japanese governor, Ando Rikichi, who signed the document of surrender on the next day. On the next day, Chen Yi proclaimed Taiwan Retrocession Day. The validity of the proclamation is subject to some debate however, with some supporters of Taiwan independence arguing that it is invalid, and that the date simply marks the start of a military occupation by the Republic of China.

During the immediate postwar period, the Chinese Kuomintang administration on Taiwan was inept and corrupt, while soldiers were breaking the laws. Many Taiwanese people were disillusioned with the incoming Kuomintang administration, which proved to be as harsh as Japanese imperial rule. Anti-mainlander violence flared on 28 February 1947 following an accidental shooting of a cigarette vendor by the police.

The resulting 28 February Incident became a pivotal event in the shaping of modern Taiwanese identity. For several weeks after the incident, many Taiwanese rebelled, participating in island-wide riots protesting the government&#x27;s corruption and harsh rule. The governor, Chen Yi, while negotiating with leaders of the protest movement, called for troops from mainland China. The Kuomintang, allegedly fearing a Communist infiltration, assembled a large military force to quell the disturbance in Taiwan, in the process killing many and imprisoning thousands of others. Many of the Taiwanese who had formed home rule groups under the Japanese were the victims of the incident, as were civilian mainlanders who bore the brunt of vigilante retaliation.

This was followed by martial law and the &quot;White Terror&quot; in which many thousands of people were imprisoned or executed for their political opposition to the Kuomintang. Many victims of the white terror were Taiwanese elite—political leaders, wealthier families, intellectuals, etc. In addition, mainlanders were not spared either, as many had real or perceived associations with communists before they came to Taiwan. For example, some mainlanders who had joined book clubs in mainland China, deemed leftist by the government, were liable to be arrested and many served long prison sentences for these real or perceived threats.

Martial law, among other things, included sedition laws against supporters of communism or Taiwanese independence, leading to very substantial political repression. It also prohibited the formation of new parties (though opposition figures could run as independents or tangwai). Second, because of the ROC&#x27;s claim to rule all of China, the vast majority of the seats in the Legislative Yuan (parliament) and National Assembly (electoral college for the president, now abolished) were held by those elected from mainland China constituencies in 1947 and 1948. The regime argued that these legislators should keep their seats until elections in their original constituencies were possible. Although the KMT passed measures on elections in 1972 intended to increase Taiwanese representation in these bodies, the huge majorities of senior legislators continued through 1990, guaranteeing KMT control whether or not the party won on election day. More informally, the long-term residents of Taiwan prior to the late 1940s remained distinctly under-represented in the top ranks of government and the party through the early 1990s, suggesting a significant limit to democratization.

===Economic developments===
Partially with the help of the China Aid Act of 1948 and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, the Republic of China government implemented a far-reaching and highly successful land reform program on Taiwan during the 1950s. They redistributed land among small farmers and compensated large landowners with commodities certificates and stock in state-owned industries. These rural reforms, such as the 375 rent reduction program, were never implemented with much force in mainland China but were very successful in Taiwan.

Overall, although the reforms left some large landowners impoverished, others turned their compensation into capital and started commercial and industrial enterprises. These entrepreneurs were to become Taiwan&#x27;s first industrial capitalists. Together with refugee businessmen from mainland China, they managed Taiwan&#x27;s transition from an agricultural to a commercial, industrial economy.

Taiwan&#x27;s phenomenal economic development earned it a spot as one of the four Four Asian Tigers, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, though as of late, much work remains in the ongoing process of privatization of state-owned industries and in financial sector reforms.

===Diplomatic setbacks===

The 1970s saw many switches in diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. After World War II, the Republic of China had been one of the founding members in the United Nations and held China&#x27;s seat on the Security Council until 1971, when it was expelled by General Assembly Resolution 2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the People&#x27;s Republic of China government. (Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to re-join the UN have not made it past committee. See China and the United Nations.) Since the 1980s, the number of nations officially recognizing the Republic of China has decreased to 19.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China refuses to maintain diplomatic relations with any government which formally recognizes the Republic of China, leading to a complex political status of Taiwan (see also one China policy and foreign relations of the Republic of China). United States troops were stationed in Taiwan after the victory of the Communists in mainland China in order to aid in the defense of Taiwan against invasion by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The United States military continued to be stationed in Taiwan until diplomatic relations were broken with the Republic of China in 1979 but to this day maintains a significant intelligence presence.

===Events after 1971===
On 5 April 1975, Chiang Kai-shek died at the age of 87. A few years later, the Kaohsiung Incident took place as seeds of dissension had begun against authoritarian rule in Taiwan which paved way for democratization of Taiwan.

The March 1987 Lieyu massacre involved the ROC military that killed 19 Vietnamese boat people. Four months later, martial law in Taiwan ended and Chiang Ching-kuo, who died in 1988, was succeeded by Lee Teng-hui, the first native Taiwanese president, which began Taiwan&#x27;s transition to democracy starting with the 1990 Wild Lily student movement, followed by the repealing of the Temporary Provisions in 1991 that culminated with the first direct elections that occurred in 1992.

==Democratic era (1991–present)==
===Democratic reforms===

The Republic of China entered into the development phase of constitutional democracy with the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947. Subsequently, the National Revolutionary Army was also renamed as Republic of China Armed Forces and was nationalized. However, due to the Chinese Civil War, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion was passed as amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China. This established martial law in Taiwan and curtailed civil liberties and democracy. The official rationale for the Provisions was the ongoing Chinese Civil War and ROC was effectively under the military rule of the KMT during the period of mobilization.

However, with the demise of the Kuomintang one-party system and democratization movement during the 1980s, the martial law was eventually lifted in 1987 and provisions were eventually rescinded in 1991. Constitutional democracy was eventually restored in ROC after 1987.

When the Republic of China relocated to Taiwan in 1949, besides Kuomintang, the Chinese Youth Party (中國青年黨) and Chinese Democratic Social Party (中國民主社會黨) were the only legal political parties in Taiwan. The other established parties operated under the Tangwai movement.

Even though Chiang Kai-shek operated an autocratic government: as part of securing Taiwan, he also slowly began democratization progress in Taiwan, beginning with the elections of local offices. He also reformed the top Kuomintang leadership, transforming the party from a democratic centralist organization to one with many factions, each with differing opinions. Chiang Ching-kuo, succeeding his father Chiang Kai-shek, accelerated to liberalize the political system in Taiwan.

Events such as the Kaohsiung Incident in 1979 highlighted the need for change and groups like Amnesty International were mobilizing a campaign against the government and President Chiang Ching-kuo. Chiang Ching-kuo, although a mainlander, pronounced that he was also a Taiwanese and also introduced many native-born Taiwanese people into top echelons of the party. He also named Lee Teng-hui, a native-born Taiwanese, as his vice president and likely successor. In 1986, the permission to form new political parties was granted, and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was inaugurated as the first opposition party.

However, a political crisis appeared imminent as the Ministry of Justice filed charges against the DPP for violating martial law restrictions, but President Chiang defused it by announcing that martial law would end and that new political parties could be formed as long as they supported the Republican Constitution and renounced both communism and Taiwan Independence. The lifting of Martial Law Decree and the ban on veterans to visit their mainland China relatives was approved in 1987; the removal of the ban on registration of new newspapers in 1988 was also a historical event.

After the 1988 death of Chiang Ching-kuo, his successor Lee Teng-hui continued to hand more government authority over to the ethnically Taiwanese and to democratize the government. In 1990, Lee held the National Affairs Conference which led to the abolishment of the national emergency period the following year and paved the way for both the total re-election for the National Assembly in 1991 and the Legislative Yuan in 1992. Full democracy in the sense that citizens are able to select their legislators, not just local officials, in free and fair elections was achieved in 1991 when the senior legislators were forced to retire. In 1994, again under the urging of President Lee, the presidency of the Republic of China was changed via constitutional revision into a position popularly elected by the people within the Free area of the Republic of China.

Under Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee&#x27;s reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan and &quot;freezing&quot; the Taiwan Provincial Government (i.e., stripping the provincial government of much of its powers and merging those powers into either the central government&#x27;s powers or local governments&#x27; powers without abolishing the provincial government altogether). Restrictions on the use of Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were lifted as well.

However, democratization had its problems. During the early stages of the process, political parties were still banned, but independent candidates, some including those who had splintered off from the Kuomintang, were allowed to run for offices, provided that they would not receive any campaign funding from the party. As a result, many of these candidates resorted to borrowing money from businessmen, local elite, or even gangsters, in exchange for political and economic favors. This was the beginning of the &quot;black gold&quot; phenomena in Taiwan in which dishonest politicians were backed by businessmen and criminal elements at the expense of the society. In opposition to this, some former Kuomintang members formed the New Party to combat the Kuomintang, which had liberalized but had also introduced widespread corruption.

Another stage was reached when the first direct elections for the powerful president were held in 1996. Lee ran as the incumbent in the ROC&#x27;s first direct presidential election against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Ming-min, which prompted the People&#x27;s Republic of China to conduct a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait to intimidate the ROC electorate. The aggressive tactic prompted United States President Bill Clinton to invoke the Taiwan Relations Act and dispatch an aircraft carrier into the region off Taiwan&#x27;s southern coast to monitor the situation.

===Political transition===

The 2000 presidential election marked the end of the Kuomintang&#x27;s status as the ruling party. Opposition DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian won a three-way race that saw the Pan-Blue vote split by independent James Soong (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan. Chan garnered 39% of the vote. After the election, Soong formed the People First Party (PFP).

Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a narrow 0.2% of the vote the 2004 presidential election over Kuomintang Chairman Lien, who had PFP Chairman Soong as his running mate. On the day before the election, both Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were shot while campaigning in Tainan. Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.

That incident might also have given president Chen the ability of declaring martial emergency, which allegedly prevented the police and military, which were strongly Pan-Blue, from voting. Lien refused to concede, alleging voting irregularities. Kuomintang and PFP supporters held mass protests throughout the following weeks. Subsequently, Kuomintang and PFP took the case to the court. The High Court ordered a recount and found no evidence to support the accusation made by Kuomintang and PFP. The Court decided that the election result was legitimate and valid.

During the legislative elections held on 8 December 2004, the Kuomintang-PFP dominated Pan-Blue alliance gained a slim majority in the elections which resulted in President Chen resigning as DPP chairman. The cabinet of Premier Yu Shyi-kun resigned, and Frank Hsieh assumed premiership on 25 January 2005.

In a move that some saw as a reaction to Chen&#x27;s re-election, the People&#x27;s Republic of China enacted a proposed anti-secession law that allows the use of force on Taiwan and the Republic of China government if it formally declares independence. However, this law was met with overwhelming protest from nearly all political parties and public figures of the Republic of China and disapproval from the western countries. Negotiations in January in Macau between the aviation authorities from both the Republic of China and People&#x27;s Republic of China resulted in direct-cross strait charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan during the Lunar New Year Period.

In 2005, President Chen and PFP Chairman Soong held a summit and the independence-leaning president indicated that eventual reunification with mainland China would be an option. Against the anti-secession law proposed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, President Chen held a video conference with the European Parliament in Brussels urging the European Union not to lift the arms embargo on the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

During most of Chen&#x27;s second term, Kuomintang and PFP together hold a pan-Blue majority in the legislature. Among the many items that have made little progress due to the political stalemate are a stalled arms procurement bill, which would advance defense capabilities of the Republic of China through the purchase of weaponry, such as sub-hunting P-3 Orions, from the US government, and banking reform legislation, which would help in the consolidation of the many banks in the Republic of China, none of which hold even 10% shares of the local market. It is important to note that the president of the Republic of China, unlike the president of the United States, does not wield veto power, providing him with little to no leverage in negotiating with an opposition legislature, regardless of how slim the majority.

The constitution was further amended in 2005, creating a two-vote electoral system, with single member plurality seats and proportional representative seats, and abolishing the National Assembly, transferring most of its former powers to the Legislative Yuan, and leaving further amendment voting to public referendums. The issue of formally declaring the independence of Taiwan is also a constant constitutional question. Arms purchases from the United States are still a controversial political question, with the Pan-Green Coalition camp favoring the purchase, and the Pan-Blue Coalition opposing it.

Recent allegations about corruption inside the First Family had led to three recall motions votes in the Legislative Yuan aimed at ousting President Chen Shui-bian. All of them had failed, because legislators voted according to political lines and the Pan-Blue Coalition lacked the two-thirds majority required to complete the process. The First Lady, Wu Shu-chen, was prosecuted for corruption, namely illegally using state funds for personal purposes.

The president faced similar accusations as his wife, but was protected from prosecution by presidential immunity. He had promised to resign if his wife was found guilty. However, after his wife fainted in the preparation hearing, she had sought and obtained absence of leave from the Court 16 times citing health concerns before the end of Chen&#x27;s term.

In December 2006, municipal and mayoral elections were held in Taipei City and Kaohsiung City. The KMT retained a majority in Taipei, while the DPP and the KMT obtained very close results in Kaohsiung. Huang Jun-ying lost to Chen Chu by a margin of 0.14 percent, making Chen Chu the first female mayor of a special municipality in the Republic of China. In 2007, the ROC applied for membership in the United Nations under the name &quot;Taiwan&quot;, and is rejected by the General Assembly.

In the 2008 presidential election, KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou defeated DPP candidate Frank Hsieh with 58.48% of the vote. Ma ran on a platform supporting friendlier relations with mainland China and economic reforms. He was re-elected in 2012 with 51% of the vote, against 46.3% for DPP&#x27;s Tsai Ing-wen and 2.7% for PFP&#x27;s James Soong.

In 2016 election, DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen defeated KMT candidate Eric Chu, and became the first female president of Republic of China.

In January, 2020, Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected in the presidential election. In the parliamentary election President Tsai&#x27;s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won majority 61 out of 113 seats. The Kuomintang (KMT) won 38 seats.

In January 2024, William Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party won Taiwan’s presidential elections. However, no party won a majority in the simultanious Taiwan&#x27;s legislative election for the first time since 2004, meaning 51 seats for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), 52 seats for the Kuomintang (KMT), and the Taiwan People&#x27;s Party (TPP) secured eight seats.

<text>Oriental Daily News is a Chinese-language newspaper in Hong Kong. It was established in 1969 by Ma Sik-yu and Ma Sik-chun, and was one of the two newspapers published by the Oriental Press Group Limited (). Relative to other Hong Kong newspapers, &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot; has an older readership.

==History==
The paper was founded in 1969. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; was its main competitor. The newspaper&#x27;s website was started in February 2002, and includes e-paper versions of &quot;Oriental Daily&quot;. The whole printed version is uploaded onto the web allowing people from all over the world to read. It is considered Pro-Beijing camp in its editorial stance.

==Content==

It has two editorials every day. The first one is called the &#x27;Main Editorial&#x27; (正論), which is a typical newspaper editorial. The second one is called &#x27;Kung Fu Tea&#x27; (功夫茶), which is written in the vernacular form of Cantonese, and is a daily critique of the misfits of the bureaucracy.

<doc id="269002" wikidata="Q10586" url="?curid=269002" title="Aquila (constellation)">
<text>Aquila is a constellation on the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for &#x27;eagle&#x27; and it represents the bird that carried Zeus/Jupiter&#x27;s thunderbolts in Greek-Roman mythology.

Its brightest star, Altair, is one vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the northern summer, as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and galaxies are few.

==History==
Aquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy. It had been earlier mentioned by Eudoxus in the fourth century BC and Aratus in the third century BC.

It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. The constellation was also known as &quot;Vultur volans&quot; (the flying vulture) to the Romans, not to be confused with &quot;Vultur cadens&quot; which was their name for Lyra. It is often held to represent the eagle which held Zeus&#x27;s/Jupiter&#x27;s thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology. Aquila is also associated with the eagle that kidnapped Ganymede, a son of one of the kings of Troy (associated with Aquarius), to Mount Olympus to serve as cup-bearer to the gods.

Ptolemy catalogued 19 stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of Antinous, which was named in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117–138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to Tycho Brahe, who catalogued 12 stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. Hevelius determined 23 stars in the first and 19 in the second.

The Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle, but is sometimes mistakenly thought as a seagull which is located in the same area as the Greek constellation.

==Notable features==

===Stars===

Aquila, which lies in the Milky Way, contains many rich starfields and has been the location of many novae.
* α Aql (Altair) is the brightest star in this constellation and one of the closest naked-eye stars to Earth at a distance of 17 light-years. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase &quot;al-nasr al-tair&quot;, meaning &quot;the flying eagle&quot;. Altair has a magnitude of 0.76. It is one of the three stars of the Summer Triangle, along with Vega and Deneb. It is an A-type main-sequence star with 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. The star rotates quickly, and this gives the star an oblate shape where it is flattened towards the poles.
* β Aql (Alshain) is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.7, 45 light-years from Earth. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase &quot;shahin-i tarazu&quot;, meaning &quot;the balance&quot;; this name referred to Altair, Alshain, and Tarazed. The primary is a G-type subgiant star with a spectral type of G9.5 IV and the secondary is a red dwarf. The subgiant primary has three times the radius of the Sun and six times the luminosity.
* γ Aql (Tarazed) is an orange-hued giant star of around magnitude 2.7, 460 light-years from Earth. Its name, like that of Alshain, comes from the Arabic for &quot;the balance&quot;. It is the second-brightest star in the constellation and is an unconfirmed variable star.
* ζ Aql (Okab) is a binary star of magnitude 3.0, 83 light-years from Earth. The primary is an A-type main sequence star, and the secondary has half the mass of the Sun.
* η Aql is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 1200 light-years from Earth. Among the brightest Cepheid variable stars, it has a minimum magnitude of 4.4 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5 with a period of 7.2 days. The variability was originally observed by Edward Pigott in 1784. There are also two companion stars which orbit the supergiant: a B-type main sequence star and an F-type main sequence star.
* ρ Aql moved across the border into neighboring Delphinus in 1992, and is an A-type star with a lower metallicity than the Sun.
* 15 Aql is an optical double star. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 5.41 and a spectral type of K1 III, 325 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a purple-hued star of magnitude 7.0, 550 light-years from Earth. The pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes.
* 57 Aql is a binary star. The primary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 6.5. The system is approximately 350 light-years from Earth; the pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes. Both stars in the system rotate rapidly.
* R Aql is a red-hued giant star 690 light-years from Earth. It is a Mira variable with a minimum magnitude of 12.0, a maximum magnitude of 6.0, and a period around 9 months. It has a diameter of 400 D☉.
* V Aql is a typical Cool Carbon Star. It&#x27;s one of the most red-colored examples of this sort of stars, observable through common amateur telescopes.
* FF Aql is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 2500 light-years from Earth. It is a Cepheid variable star with a minimum magnitude of 5.7, a maximum magnitude of 5.2, and a period of 4.5 days. It is a spectroscopic binary with a spectral type of F6Ib. A third star is also a member of the system, and there is also a fourth star which is probably unconnected with the main system.

===Novae===
A bright nova was observed in Aquila in 1918 (Nova Aquilae 1918) and briefly shone brighter than Altair, the brightest star in Aquila. It was first seen by Zygmunt Laskowski and was confirmed on the night of 8 June 1918. Nova Aquilae reached a peak apparent magnitude of −0.5 and was the brightest nova recorded since the invention of the telescope.

===Deep-sky objects===

Three interesting planetary nebulae lie in Aquila:
* NGC 6804 shows a small but bright ring.
* NGC 6781 bears some resemblance with the Owl Nebula in Ursa Major. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1788.
* NGC 6751, also known as the Glowing Eye, is a planetary nebula. The nebula is estimated to be roughly 0.8 light-years in diameter.
More deep-sky objects:
* NGC 6709 is a loose open cluster containing roughly 40 stars, which range in magnitude from 9 to 11. It is about 3000 light-years from Earth. It has an overall magnitude of 6.7 and is about 9100 light-years from Earth. NGC 6709 appears in a rich Milky Way star field and is classified as a Shapley class d and Trumpler class III 2 m cluster. These designations mean that it does not have many stars, is loose, does not show greater concentration at the center, and has a moderate range of star magnitudes. There are 305 confirmed member stars and one candidate red giant.
* NGC 6755 is an open cluster of 7.5 m; it is made up of about a dozen stars with magnitudes 12 through 13. It is located approximately 8,060 light-years from the Solar System.
* NGC 6760 is a globular cluster of 9.1 m. At least two pulsars have been discovered in the globular cluster, and it has a Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class of IX.
* NGC 6749 is an open cluster.
* NGC 6778 is a planetary nebula located about 10,300 light-years away from the Solar System.
* NGC 6741 is a planetary nebula.
* NGC 6772 is a planetary nebula.
* W51 (3C400) is one of the largest stellar nurseries in the Milky Way. Located about 17,000 light-years from Earth, W51 is about 350 light-years – or about 2 quadrillion miles – across. However, it&#x27;s located in an area so thick with interstellar dust that it&#x27;s opaque to visible light. Observations by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and the Spitzer Infrared Telescope reveal W51 would appear about as large as the full Moon in visible light.

Aquila also holds some extragalactic objects. One of them is what may be the largest single mass concentration of galaxies in the Universe known, the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall. It was discovered in November 2013, and has the size of 10 billion light years. It is the biggest and the most massive structure in the Universe known.

===Other===
NASA&#x27;s Pioneer 11 space probe, which flew by Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s, is expected to pass near the star Lambda (λ) Aquilae in about 4 million years.

==Illustrations==
In illustrations of Aquila that represent it as an eagle, a nearly straight line of three stars symbolizes part of the wings. The center and brightest of these three stars is Altair.

==Mythology==

According to Gavin White, the Babylonian Eagle carried the constellation called the Dead Man in its talons. The author also draws a comparison to the classical stories of Antinous and Ganymede.

In classical Greek mythology, Aquila was identified as Αετός Δίας (&quot;Aetos Dios&quot;), the eagle that carried the thunderbolts of Zeus and was sent by him to carry the shepherd boy Ganymede, whom he desired, to Mount Olympus; the constellation of Aquarius is sometimes identified with Ganymede.

In the Chinese love story of Qi Xi, Niu Lang (Altair) and his two children (β and γ Aquilae) are separated forever from their wife and mother Zhi Nu (Vega), who is on the far side of the river, the Milky Way.

In Hinduism, the constellation Aquila is identified with the half-eagle half-human deity Garuda.

In ancient Egypt, Aquila possibly was seen as the falcon of Horus. According to Berio, the identification of Aquila as an Egyptian constellation, and not merely Graeco-Babylonian, is corroborated by the Daressy Zodiac. It depicts an outer ring showing the Sphaera Graeca, the familiar Hellenistic zodiac, while the middle ring depicts the Sphaera Barbarica or foreigner&#x27;s zodiac with the zodiacal signs of the Egyptian&quot; dodekaoros&quot; which were also recorded by Teucros of Babylon. Under the sign of Sagittarius is the falcon of Horus, presumably because Aquila rises with Sagittarius.

==Equivalents==
In Chinese astronomy, ζ Aql is located within the Heavenly Market Enclosure (天市垣, &quot;Tiān Shì Yuán&quot;), and the other stars of the constellation are placed within the Black Tortoise of the North (北方玄武, &quot;Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ&quot;).

Several different Polynesian equivalents to Aquila as a whole are known. On the island of Futuna, it was called &quot;Kau-amonga&quot;, meaning &quot;Suspended Burden&quot;. Its name references the Futunan name for Orion&#x27;s belt and sword, &quot;Amonga&quot;. In Hawaii, Altair was called &quot;Humu&quot;, translated to English as &quot;to sew, to bind together parts of a fishhook.&quot; &quot;Humu&quot; also refers to the hole by which parts of a hook are bound together. &quot;Humu-ma&quot; was said to influence the astrologers. &quot;Pao-toa&quot; was the name for the entire constellation in the Marquesas Islands; the name meant &quot;Fatigued Warrior&quot;. Also, Polynesian constellations incorporated the stars of modern Aquila. The Pukapuka constellation &quot;Tolu&quot;, meaning &quot;three&quot;, was made up of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Aquilae. Altair was commonly named among Polynesian peoples, as well. The people of Hawaii called it &quot;Humu&quot;, the people of the Tuamotus called it &quot;Tukituki&quot; (&quot;Pound with a hammer&quot;) - they named Beta Aquilae &quot;Nga Tangata&quot; (&quot;The Men&quot;) - and the people of Pukapuka called Altair &quot;Turu&quot; and used it as a navigational star. The Māori people named Altair &quot;Poutu-te-rangi&quot;, &quot;Pillar of the Sky&quot;, because of its important position in their cosmology. It was used differently in different Māori calendars, being the star of February and March in one version and March and April in the other. Altair was also the star that ruled the annual sweet potato harvest.

<doc id="269013" wikidata="Q1370565" url="?curid=269013" title="Sash">
<text>A sash is a large and usually colorful ribbon or band of material worn around the human body, either draping from one shoulder to the opposing hip and back up, or else encircling the waist. The sash around the waist may be worn in daily attire, but the sash from shoulder to hip is worn on ceremonial occasions only. Ceremonial sashes are also found in a V-shaped format, draping straight from both shoulders down, intersecting and forming an angle over the chest or abdomen.

== Military use ==
=== Old Europe ===

In the mid-and late-16th century waist and shoulder sashes came up as a mark of (high) military rank or to show personal affection to a political party or nation. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the distinctive sash colour of the House of Habsburg was red while their French opponents wore white or blue sashes and the Swedish voted for blue sashes.

Beginning from the end of the 17th century, commissioned officers in the British Army wore waist sashes of crimson silk. The original officer&#x27;s sash was six inches wide by eighty-eight inches long with a ten-inch (gold or silver) fringe. It was large enough to form a hammock stretcher to carry a wounded officer. From about 1730 to 1768, the officer&#x27;s sash was worn baudericke wise, i.e. from the right shoulder to the left hip, and afterwards around the waist again.

Sergeants were permitted sashes of crimson wool, with a single stripe of facing colour following the clothing regulations of 1727. Whereas it remained vague whether the sash was to be worn over the shoulder or around the waist, it was clarified in 1747 that sergeants had to wear their sashes around the waist. From 1768, the sergeant&#x27;s waist sash had one (until 1825) resp. three (until 1845) stripes of facing colour; in regiments with red or purple facings the sergeant&#x27;s sash had white stripes or remained plain crimson.

Until 1914 waist-sashes in distinctive national colours were worn as a peace-time mark of rank by officers of the Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies, amongst others.

The barrel sash is a type of belt traditionally worn by hussars.

=== Modern Europe ===
Since then sashes have been part of formal military attire (compare the sword belt known as a baldric, and the cummerbund). Thus several other modern armies retain waist-sashes for wear by officers in ceremonial uniforms. These include the armies of Norway (crimson sashes), Sweden (yellow and blue), Greece (light blue and white), the Netherlands (orange), Portugal (crimson) and Spain (red and gold for generals, light blue for general staff and crimson for infantry officers).

The Spanish Regulares (infantry descended from colonial regiments formerly recruited in Spanish Morocco) retain their historic waist-sashes for all ranks in colours that vary according to the unit.

Sashes are a distinctive feature of some regiments of the modern French Army for parade dress. They are worn around the waist in the old Algerian or Zouave style (&quot;ceinture de laine&quot;). Traditionally these sashes were more than in length and in width. In the historic French Army of Africa, sashes were worn around the waist in either blue for European or red for indigenous troops.

=== (British) Commonwealth of Nations ===
The modern British Army retains a scarlet sash for wear in certain orders of dress by sergeants and above serving in infantry regiments, over the right shoulder to the left hip. A similar crimson silk net sash is worn around the waist by officers of the Foot Guards in scarlet full dress and officers of line infantry in dark blue &quot;Number 1&quot; dress. The same practice is followed in some Commonwealth armies.

The present-day armies of India and Pakistan both make extensive use of waist-sashes for ceremonial wear. The colours vary widely according to regiment or branch and match those of the turbans where worn. Typically two or more colours are incorporated in the sash, in vertical stripes. One end hangs loose at the side and may have an ornamental fringe. The practice of wearing distinctive regimental sashes or cummerbunds goes back to the late nineteenth century.

Cross-belts resembling sashes are worn by drum majors in the Dutch, British and some Commonwealth armies. These carry scrolls bearing the names of battle honours.

=== United States of America ===

In the United States, George Washington, who served as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and later served as the first President of the United States, was noted for wearing a blue ribbed sash, similar to that of the British Order of the Garter, early in the war, as he had in 1775 prescribed the use of green, pink, and blue sashes to identify aides de camp, brigade-majors, brigadiers general, majors general, and the commander in chief in the absence of formal uniforms. He later gave up the sash as &quot;unrepublican&quot; and &quot;pretentious for all but the highest-ranking aristocracy&quot;, according to historians. Washington is seen wearing the sash in Charles Wilson Peale&#x27;s 1779 painting &quot;Washington at Princeton&quot;.

Sashes continued to be used in the United States Army for sergeants and officers. In 1821 the red sashes (crimson for officers) were limited to first sergeants and above. In 1872 the sashes were abolished by all ranks but generals continued to wear their buff silk sashes in full dress until 1917. Waist sashes (in combination with a sabre) in the old style are still worn by the officers and senior NCOs of the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Guard of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) as well by the West Point Band drum major along with the West Point cadet officers. The drum major of the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps also still wears a waist sash, but no sidearms.

At the time of the American Civil War (1861–65) generals of the regular US Army wore silk sashes in buff. Officers were authorized silk sashes in crimson (medical officers: emerald) while red woollen sashes were entitled to senior non-commissioned officers (&quot;Army Regulations of 1861&quot;). In the Confederate Army sashes were worn by all sergeant ranks and officers. The colour indicated the corps or status of the wearer. For example: yellow for cavalry, burgundy for infantry, black for chaplains, red for sergeants, green or blue for medics, and grey or cream for general officers.

=== Myanmar ===
Since 1948, Burmese presidents have worn the traditional Burmese sash worn by ancient Burmese kings, which resembles a Western-style sash, at state ceremonies.
What makes Myanmar sash different from Western countries is that the sash is made of gold, and is called the golden sash.

=== Japan ===
Japanese officers continued the practice in full dress uniform until 1940.

==Presidential sash==
A presidential sash is a cloth sash worn by presidents of many nations in the world. Such sashes are worn by presidents in Africa, Asia, Europe and, most notably, in Latin America.

The sash is an important symbol of the continuity of the presidency and is only worn by the president. Its value as a symbol of the office of the head of state can be compared to that of a crown in monarchies. Presidents leaving office formally present the sash to their successor during the official inauguration ceremony.

Presidential sashes are usually very colorful, large, and designed to resemble the nation&#x27;s flag, especially those of Latin American presidents. They are usually worn over the right shoulder to the left side of the hip. The national coat of arms is also traditionally placed on the sash. A national order&#x27;s star or chain of office can also be worn.

==Modern civilian and cultural use==

With the genesis of complex systems of military and civilian awards during the 18th century in most European countries, sashes became a distinguishing part of honorific orders and are mostly worn along with decorations and medals. Today, various members of most European royal families wear sashes (also known as ribands) as part of their royal (and/or military) regalia on formal occasions. Some merit orders (such as the French Legion of Honour) also include sashes as part of the senior-most grades&#x27; insignia. Likewise, Italian military officers wear light blue sashes over the right shoulder on ceremonial occasions.

In Latin America and some countries of Africa, a special presidential sash indicates a president&#x27;s authority. In France and Italy, sashes – featuring the national flag tricolours and worn on the right shoulder – are used by public authorities and local officials (such as legislators) during public ceremonial events.

In the United States, the sash has acquired a more ceremonial and less practical purpose. Sashes are used at higher education commencement ceremonies, by high school homecoming parade nominees, in beauty pageants, and by corporations to acknowledge high achievement.

In Canada, hand-woven sashes (known as &quot;ceintures fléchées&quot; or sometimes &quot;L&#x27;Assomption sashes&quot; after a Quebec town named L&#x27;Assomption in which they were mass-produced) were derived from Iroquois carrying belts sometime during the 18th century. As a powerful multi-use tool, this sash found use in the fur trade, which brought it into the North West using French voyageurs. During this period, the weave got tighter and size expanded, with some examples more than four metres in length. Coloured thread was widely used. The sash is a shared cultural emblem between French-Canadians and Métis peoples. Today, it is considered to be primarily a symbol of the 1837 Lower Canada Rebellion &quot;Patriotes&quot; and the Métis Nation. In modern times, &quot;Bonhomme Carnaval&quot;, the snowman mascot of the Quebec Winter Carnival, wears a &quot;ceinture fléchée&quot; as part of his attire in recognition of the province&#x27;s heritage.

In the British Isles, especially Northern Ireland, the sash is a symbol of the Orange Order. Orange Order sashes were originally of the ceremonial shoulder-to-hip variety, as worn by the British military. Over the course of the 20th century, the sash was mostly replaced by V-shaped collarettes, which are still generally referred to as sashes. The item is celebrated in the song &quot;The Sash my Father Wore&quot;.

Sashes are also worn by:
* Boy Scouts and Girl Guides, with badges sewn onto the sash to indicate Scouting achievements;
* Beauty pageant contestants, to display their region or title.

Sashes are part of the diplomatic uniform of many countries.

Many modern schools of Chinese martial arts use sashes of various colors to denote rank, as a reflection of the Japanese ranking system using belts. The Japanese equivalent of a sash, &quot;obi&quot;, serves to hold a kimono or yukata together.

== Honorific orders ==
Sashes are indicative of holding the class of Grand Cross or Grand Cordon in a chivalric order or an order of merit. The sash is usually worn from the right shoulder to the left hip. A few orders do the contrary, according to their traditional statute.

* : Order of the Elephant

==Deadliest crash==
1985 remains one of the deadliest years in aviation history. The deadliest of this year was Japan Air Lines Flight 123, a Boeing 747 which crashed in mountainous terrain in Gunma prefecture, Japan, on 12 August, killing 520 of the 524 people on board; the accident was the deadliest of the 1980s decade, and remains the deadliest single-aircraft accident in aviation history. The second deadliest of the 1980s took place only weeks before, when Air India Flight 182, also a Boeing 747, was destroyed by a terrorist bomb over the Atlantic Ocean west of Ireland on 23 June, killing all 329 people on board. August 1985 remains the worst single month for commercial aviation fatalities in history. Largely accounting for Flights 123, 182 and the 12 December crash of Arrow Air Flight 1285R (256 fatalities), a total of 2,010 people were killed in commercial aviation accidents in 1985; the second highest in commercial aviation history since 1942; only 1972 had more fatalities (2,373).

<doc id="269024" wikidata="Q1022918" url="?curid=269024" title="Kowloon Walled City">
<text>Kowloon Walled City () was an extremely densely populated and largely lawless enclave of China within the boundaries of Kowloon City of former British Hong Kong. Built as an imperial Chinese military fort, the walled city became a &quot;de jure&quot; enclave after the New Territories were leased to the United Kingdom in 1898. Its population increased dramatically after the end of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during World War II, attracting mostly refugees fleeing the renewed Chinese Civil War.

By the late 1980s, the walled city contained roughly 35,000 residents within its territory of . As a result of the absence of any widely recognized bureaucracy, the city&#x27;s residents and businesses had no municipal codes to govern them. Enabled by the enclave&#x27;s anarchic nature, trade in banned products thrived, ranging from narcotics to dog meat. From the 1950s to the 1970s, it was controlled by local triad gangs and had high rates of prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse.

In January 1987, the British colonial government announced plans to demolish the walled city. After an arduous eviction process and the transfer of &quot;de jure&quot; sovereignty of the enclave from China to Britain, demolition began in March 1993 and was completed in April 1994. Kowloon Walled City Park opened in December 1995 and occupies the area of the former walled city. Some historical artefacts from the walled city, including its &quot;yamen&quot; building and remnants of its southern gate, have been preserved there.

==History==
===Military outpost===
The history of the walled city can be traced back to the Song dynasty (960–1279), when a military outpost was set up to manage the salt trade in the area. Little took place for hundreds of years afterward, although 30 guards were stationed there in 1668. A small coastal fort was established around 1810 after Chinese forces abandoned Tung Lung Fort. In 1842, during Qing Daoguang Emperor&#x27;s reign, Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain by the Treaty of Nanking. As a result, the Qing authorities felt it necessary to improve the fort to rule the area and check further British influence. The improvements, including the formidable defensive wall, were completed in 1847. The walled city was captured by rebels during the Taiping Rebellion in 1854, before being retaken a few weeks later.
The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898 handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years, but excluded the walled city, which at the time had a population of roughly 700. China was allowed to continue to keep officials there as long as they did not interfere with the defence of British Hong Kong. The following year, the governor, Sir Henry Blake, suspected that the viceroy of Canton was using troops to aid resistance to the new arrangements. On 14 April 1899, British forces attacked the walled city, only to find the viceroy&#x27;s soldiers gone, leaving behind only the mandarin and 150 residents. The Qing dynasty ended its rule in 1912, leaving the walled city to the British.

Though the British claimed ownership of the walled city, they did little with it over the following few decades. The Holy Trinity Church established an old people&#x27;s home in the old yamen as well as a school and an almshouse in other former offices. Aside from such institutions, however, the walled city became a mere curiosity for British colonials and tourists to visit; it was labelled as &quot;Chinese Town&quot; in a 1915 map. In 1933, the Hong Kong authorities announced plans to demolish most of the decaying walled city&#x27;s buildings, compensating the 436 squatters that lived there with new homes. That same year, the Nationalist Chinese government protested, claiming jurisdiction over the city. The Nationalist Chinese government continued to make claims on its jurisdiction throughout 1935, 1936, and the first half of 1937, until the war between China and Japan started.

By 1940, only the yamen, the school, and one house remained. During the World War II occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese occupying forces demolished the city&#x27;s wall and used the stone to expand the nearby Kai Tak Airport.

===Urban settlement===
After Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, China announced its intent to reclaim the walled city. In November 1946, Nationalist Chinese officials created the &quot;Draft Outline Plan for Reinstatement of Administration&quot; of the area, which included an office, schools, police, and other functions. Refugees fleeing the Chinese Civil War post-1945 poured into Hong Kong, and 2,000 squatters occupied the walled city by 1947. After an attempt to drive them out in 1948, the British adopted a &#x27;hands-off&#x27; policy in most matters concerning the walled city. On 8 January 1948, the Nationalist Chinese government sent a memorandum to the British Ambassador, stating &quot;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs now formally declare to the British Embassy that, in accordance with the provisions of the said Convention, the Chinese Government enjoys jurisdiction over the City of Kowloon and that they have no intention whatsoever of renouncing this jurisdiction.&quot; The British Foreign Office, on 4 February 1948, considered a variety of solutions (including turning the site into a Nationalist Chinese Consulate-General), and ultimately recommended that the British &quot;accept the principle of Chinese jurisdiction over Kowloon Walled City but the Chinese agree not to attempt to exercise that jurisdiction in practice.&quot; Additionally, the British Foreign Office said that &quot;A public garden controlled by the municipal authorities of Kowloon Leased territory offers such a solution and so would a Chinese consular compound, if the Chinese could first be induced to agree in principle to the appointment of a Consul General.&quot;

In January 1950, a fire broke out that destroyed over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated by the lack of political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the walled city the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.

With no government enforcement from the Chinese or the British aside from a few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the walled city became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the walled city that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By that time, however, the walled city was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads.

Beginning in the 1950s, triad groups such as the 14K and Sun Yee On gained a stranglehold on the walled city&#x27;s numerous brothels, gambling parlours, and opium dens. The walled city had become such a haven for criminals that police would venture into it only in large groups. It was not until 1973 and 1974, when a series of more than 3,500 police raids resulted in over 2,500 arrests and over of seized drugs, that the triads&#x27; power began to wane. With public support, particularly from younger residents, the continued raids gradually eroded drug use and violent crime. In 1983, the district police commander declared the walled city&#x27;s crime rate to be under control.
The city also underwent massive construction during the 1960s, with developers building new modular structures above older ones. The city became extremely densely populated and &quot;a world unto its own&quot;, an enclave, with over 33,000 people in 300 buildings occupying little more than . As a result, the city reached its maximum size by the late 1970s and early 1980s; a height restriction of 13 to 14 storeys had been imposed on the city due to the flight path of planes heading toward Kai Tak Airport. As well as limiting building height, the proximity of the airport subjected residents to serious noise pollution. Eight municipal pipes provided water to the entire structure, although more could have come from wells. A few of the streets were illuminated by fluorescent lights, as sunlight rarely reached the lower levels due to the outstanding disregard to air rights within the city. Although the rampant crime of earlier decades diminished in later years, the walled city was still known for its high number of unlicensed doctors and dentists who could operate there without threat of prosecution.

Although the walled city was for many years a hotbed of criminal activity, most residents were not involved in any crime and lived peacefully within its walls. Numerous small factories and businesses thrived inside the walled city, and some residents formed groups to organise and improve daily life there. An attempt by the government in 1963 to demolish some shacks in a corner of the city gave rise to an &quot;anti-demolition committee&quot; that served as the basis for a kaifong association. Charities, religious societies, and other welfare groups were gradually introduced to the city. While medical clinics and schools went unregulated, the Hong Kong government provided some services such as water supply and mail delivery.

===Eviction and demolition===

The quality of life in the city—sanitary conditions in particular—remained far behind the rest of Hong Kong. The Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 laid the groundwork for the city&#x27;s demolition. The mutual decision by the two governments to tear down the walled city was announced on 14 January 1987. On 10 March 1987, following the announcement that the walled city would be converted to a park, the Secretary for District Administration formally requested the Urban Council to take over the site following demolition. Owing to the presence of numerous other green spaces in the area, the Urban Services Department doubted the need for &quot;yet another park&quot; from a planning and operations point of view, but the council agreed nonetheless to accept the government&#x27;s proposal on the condition that the government bear the cost of park construction.

The government distributed some () in compensation to the estimated 33,000 residents and businesses in a plan devised by a special committee of the Hong Kong Housing Authority. Some residents were not satisfied with the compensation and were forcibly evicted between November 1991 and July 1992. While it was deserted, the empty city was used to film a scene in the 1993 movie &quot;Crime Story&quot;.

After four months of planning, demolition of the walled city began on 23 March 1993 and concluded in April 1994. Construction work on Kowloon Walled City Park started the following month. Some historic structures within the former have been preserved and integrated into the new park.

==The city before demolition==
===Layout and architecture===

The walled city was located in an area of Kowloon that became known as Kowloon City. In spite of its transformation from a fort into an urban enclave, the walled city retained the same basic layout. The original fort was built on a slope and consisted of a plot measuring about . The stone wall surrounding it had four entrances and measured tall and thick before it was dismantled in 1943.

Construction surged dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s, until the formerly low-rise city consisted almost entirely of buildings with 10 storeys or more (with the notable exception of the yamen in its centre). However, due to Kai Tak Airport&#x27;s position south of the city, buildings did not exceed 14 storeys. The two-storey Sai Tau Tsuen settlement bordered the walled city to the south and west until it was cleared in 1985 and replaced with Carpenter Road Park.

The city&#x27;s dozens of alleyways were often only wide, and had poor lighting and drainage. An informal network of staircases and passageways also formed on upper levels, which was so extensive that one could travel north to south through the entire city without ever touching solid ground. Construction in the city went unregulated, and most of the roughly 350 buildings were built with poor foundations and few or no utilities. Because apartments were so small—a typical unit was —space was maximised with wider upper floors, caged balconies and rooftop additions. Roofs in the city were full of television antennas, clothes lines, water tanks, and rubbish, and could be crossed using a series of ladders.

===Demography===
Kowloon Walled City&#x27;s early population fluctuated between zero and a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II. However, there is no accurate population information available for much of the walled city&#x27;s later existence. Official census numbers estimated the walled city&#x27;s population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981. Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring squatter village of Sai Tau Tsuen. Population figures of about 50,000 were also reported.

A thorough government survey in 1987 gave a clearer picture: an estimated 33,000 people resided within the walled city. Based on this survey, the walled city had a population density of approximately in 1987, making it the most densely populated spot in the world. Names in Kowloon Walled City were mostly Cantonese.

===Culture===

In response to difficult living conditions, residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The city&#x27;s rooftops were important gathering places, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.

The yamen in the heart of the city was also a major social centre, a place for residents to talk, have tea or watch television, and to take classes such as calligraphy. The Old People&#x27;s Centre also held religious meetings for Christians and others. Other religious institutions included the Fuk Tak and Tin Hau temples, which were used for a combination of Buddhist, Taoist, and animist practices.

==Current status as park==

===Design and construction===
The area where the walled city once stood is now Kowloon Walled City Park, adjacent to Carpenter Road Park. The park was completed in August 1995 and handed over to the Urban Council. It was opened officially by Governor Chris Patten a few months later on 22 December. Construction of the park cost a total of .

The park&#x27;s design is modelled on Jiangnan gardens of the early Qing dynasty. It is divided into eight landscape features, with the fully restored yamen as its centrepiece. The park&#x27;s paths and pavilions are named after streets and buildings in the walled city. Artefacts from the walled city, such as five inscribed stones and three old wells, are also on display in the park. The park was designed by the Architectural Services Department, which won a &quot;prestigious award&quot; from the Central Society of Horticulture of Germany for the redevelopment.

Components of the park include:
* The Eight Floral Walks, each named after a different plant or flower
* The Chess Garden, featuring four Chinese chessboards
* The Garden of Chinese zodiac, containing stone statues of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals
* The Garden of Four Seasons (named Guangyin Square after the small open area in the walled city), a garden with plants that symbolise the four seasons
* The Six Arts Terrace, a wedding area containing a garden and the Bamboo Pavilion
* The Kuixing Pavilion, including a moon gate framed by two stone tablets and the towering Guibi Rock, which represents Hong Kong&#x27;s return to China
* The Mountain View Pavilion, a two-storey structure resembling a docked boat that provides a good view of the entire park
* The Lung Tsun, Yuk Tong, and Lung Nam Pavilions
* The yamen and the remains of the South Gate (see below).

===Declared monuments===

The Antiquities and Monuments Office conducted archaeological examinations as the walled city was being demolished, and several cultural remains were discovered. Among them were the walled city&#x27;s yamen and remnants of its South Gate, which were officially designated declared monuments of Hong Kong on 4 October 1996.

The South Gate had originally served as the walled city&#x27;s main entrance. Along with its foundation, other remains included two stone plaques inscribed with &quot;South Gate&quot; and &quot;Kowloon Walled City&quot; from the South Gate and a flagstone path that had led up to it. The foundations of the city&#x27;s wall and East Gate were also discovered. The Hong Kong government preserved the South Gate remnants next to a square in front of the yamen.

The yamen building is made up of three halls. Originally the middle hall served the Assistant Magistrate of Kowloon&#x27;s administrative office, and the rear block was his residence. After the government officials left the area in 1899, it was used for several other purposes, including an old people&#x27;s home, a refuge for widows and orphans, a school, and a clinic. It was restored in 1996 and is now found near the centre of the park. It contains a photo gallery of the walled city, and two cannons dating back to 1802 sit at the sides of its entrance.

== Cultural memory ==

A lack of governance, and separation from Hong Kong, provided a distinct culture in the city. Crime and corruption were common; the police were known to co-operate with the triads operating in the city. During the 1970s greater police presence reduced crime and the city became home to those seeking to avoid business regulation and taxes.

While the city was shunned in its early existence, it has since become a source of pride for many Hong Kong residents. The rising publicity around Hong Kong following the 1997 handover sparked a re-emergence in the public interest of Kowloon Walled City and its disappearance. Popular memory tends to sanitise the city, forgetting the crime and corruption. The city has begun to be portrayed with a romantic dystopian identity, and many forms of modern media have borrowed the city&#x27;s culture in their works.

=== Literature ===
A few of the people who spent time in Kowloon Walled City have written accounts of their experiences. Evangelist Jackie Pullinger wrote a 1989 memoir, &quot;Crack in the Wall&quot;, about her involvement in treating drug addicts within the walled city. In his 2004 autobiography &quot;Gweilo&quot;, Martin Booth describes his exploration of the walled city as a child in the 1950s. Gordon Jones, a District Officer of Kowloon City District at the time also published his recollections of the city during his time in office.

Robert Ludlum&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; uses the walled city as one of its settings. The city appears as a virtual reality environment (described by Steven Poole as an &quot;oasis of political and creative freedom&quot;) in William Gibson&#x27;s Bridge trilogy, and as a favourable contrast with Singapore in his &quot;Wired&quot; article &quot;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&quot;.

Chloe Gong&#x27;s 2023 adult fantasy novel &quot;Immortal Longings&quot; draws inspiration from the walled city for its setting.

===Films and television===
The 1982 Shaw Brothers film &quot;Brothers from the Walled City&quot; is set in Kowloon Walled City. The 1984 gangster film &quot;Long Arm of the Law&quot; features the walled city as a refuge for gang members before they are gunned down by police. In the 1988 film &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, the walled city is the setting for a martial arts tournament. The 1992 non-narrative film &quot;Baraka&quot; features several highly detailed shots of the walled city shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film &quot;Crime Story&quot; starring Jackie Chan was partly filmed in the deserted walled city, and includes real scenes of building explosions. A walled neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins&quot; was inspired by the walled city. The 2006 Hong Kong horror film &quot;Re-cycle&quot; features a decrepit, nightmarish version of the walled city, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee. The 2016 TVB martial arts drama &quot;A Fist Within Four Walls&quot; takes place in the triad-ridden walled city in the early 1960s. The 2024 Hong Kong action crime film &quot;Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In&quot;, an adaptation of the manhua City of Darkness by Andy Seto, sets its location and plot premise in Kowloon Walled City during the 1980s. In &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;, Kowloon served as the aesthetic basis for representing the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se.

=== Anime and manga ===
In the manga &quot;Crying Freeman&quot;, the titular character&#x27;s wife travels to the walled city to master her swordsmanship and control a cursed sword. The manga &quot;Blood+: Kowloon Nights&quot; uses the walled city as the setting for a series of murders. The later part of episode 3 and episode 4 of the anime &quot;Street&quot; are set in Kowloon Walled City, depicted as a dark and lawless area where Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li have to fight for their lives at every turn, being rescued by the police once they reach the walled city&#x27;s limits. The manga &quot;Kowloon Generic Romance&quot; is also set in the walled city.

===Video games===
Kowloon Walled City is depicted in several games, including &quot;Kowloon&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Shenmue II&quot;. The game &quot;Stranglehold&quot;, a sequel to the film &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, features a version of the walled city filled with hundreds of Triad members. In the games &quot;Fear Effect&quot; and &quot;Fear Effect 2&quot;, photographs of the walled city were used as inspiration &quot;for moods, camera angles and lighting&quot;. Concept art for the MMORPG &quot;Guild Wars Factions&quot; depicts massive, densely packed structures inspired by the walled city. The pen-and-paper RPG &quot;Shadowrun&quot; and CRPG &quot;&quot; include a crime-ridden, rebuilt version of the Walled City set in 2056. The walled city also features in the 2010 game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops.&quot; The 2022 video game &quot;Stray&quot;&#x27;s environment is influenced by the walled city as well.

===Buildings and venues===

A partial recreation of Kowloon Walled City existed in the Warehouse Kawasaki, an amusement arcade that operated from 2009 to 2019 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The atmosphere of the walled city was reflected in the arcade&#x27;s narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches.

A livehouse inspired by the Walled City opened its doors in Shibuya, Tokyo in December 2021. Known as the Shibuya Kinmirai Kaikan (), the venue hired Hong Kong artists to spray paint Cantonese graffiti on its walls to give an air of authenticity along with neon lights and posters.

The Chinese catering brand Wenheyou runs multi-storey retro-themed restaurant buildings in Changsha, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen that have been likened to the Kowloon Walled City, with some media outlets calling them either inspired by or even &quot;1:1 recreations&quot; of the city.

<text>Methemoglobinemia, or methaemoglobinaemia, is a condition of elevated methemoglobin in the blood. Symptoms may include headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, poor muscle coordination, and blue-colored skin (cyanosis). Complications may include seizures and heart arrhythmias.
Methemoglobinemia can be due to certain medications, chemicals, or food or it can be inherited. Substances involved may include benzocaine, nitrites, or dapsone. The underlying mechanism involves some of the iron in hemoglobin being converted from the ferrous [Fe2+] to the ferric [Fe3+] form. The diagnosis is often suspected based on symptoms and a low blood oxygen that does not improve with oxygen therapy. Diagnosis is confirmed by a blood gas.
Treatment is generally with oxygen therapy and methylene blue. Other treatments may include vitamin C, exchange transfusion, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Outcomes are generally good with treatment. Methemoglobinemia is relatively uncommon, with most cases being acquired rather than genetic.
==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin level above 10%) include shortness of breath, cyanosis, mental status changes (~50%), headache, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness, and loss of consciousness.

People with severe methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin level above 50%) may exhibit seizures, coma, and death (level above 70%). Healthy people may not have many symptoms with methemoglobin levels below 15%. However, people with co-morbidities such as anemia, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, sepsis, or who have abnormal hemoglobin species (e.g. carboxyhemoglobin, sulfhemoglobinemia or sickle hemoglobin) may experience moderate to severe symptoms at much lower levels (as low as 5–8%).

==Cause==

===Acquired===
Methemoglobinemia may be acquired. Classical drug causes of methemoglobinemia include various antibiotics (trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and dapsone), local anesthetics (especially articaine, benzocaine, prilocaine, and lidocaine), and aniline dyes, metoclopramide, rasburicase, umbellulone, chlorates, bromates, and nitrites. Nitrates are suspected to cause methemoglobinemia.

In otherwise healthy individuals, the protective enzyme systems normally present in red blood cells rapidly reduce the methemoglobin back to hemoglobin and hence maintain methemoglobin levels at less than one percent of the total hemoglobin concentration. Exposure to exogenous oxidizing drugs and their metabolites (such as benzocaine, dapsone, and nitrates) may lead to an increase of up to a thousandfold of the methemoglobin formation rate, overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and acutely increasing methemoglobin levels.

Infants under 6 months of age have lower levels of a key methemoglobin reduction enzyme (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase) in their red blood cells. This results in a major risk of methemoglobinemia caused by nitrates ingested in drinking water, dehydration (usually caused by gastroenteritis with diarrhea), sepsis, or topical anesthetics containing benzocaine or prilocaine resulting in blue baby syndrome. Nitrates used in agricultural fertilizers may leak into the ground and may contaminate well water. The current EPA standard of 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen for drinking water is specifically set to protect infants. Benzocaine applied to the gums or throat (as commonly used in baby teething gels, or sore throat lozenges) can cause methemoglobinemia.

===Genetic===

Due to a deficiency of the enzyme diaphorase I (cytochrome b5 reductase), methemoglobin levels rise and the blood of met-Hb patients has reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. Instead of being red in color, the arterial blood of met-Hb patients is brown. This results in the skin of white patients gaining a bluish hue. Hereditary met-Hb is caused by a recessive gene. If only one parent has this gene, offspring will have normal-hued skin, but if both parents carry the gene, there is a chance the offspring will have blue-hued skin.

Another cause of congenital methemoglobinemia is seen in patients with abnormal hemoglobin variants such as hemoglobin M (HbM), or hemoglobin H (HbH), which are not amenable to reduction despite intact enzyme systems.

Methemoglobinemia can also arise in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency due to impaired production of NADH  – the essential cofactor for diaphorase I. Similarly, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may have impaired production of another co-factor, NADPH.

==Pathophysiology==
The affinity for oxygen of ferric iron is impaired. The binding of oxygen to methemoglobin results in an &quot;increased&quot; affinity for oxygen in the remaining heme sites that are in ferrous state within the same tetrameric hemoglobin unit. This leads to an overall reduced ability of the red blood cell to release oxygen to tissues, with the associated oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve therefore shifted to the left. When methemoglobin concentration is elevated in red blood cells, tissue hypoxia may occur.

Normally, methemoglobin levels are &lt;1%, as measured by the CO-oximetry test. Elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood are caused when the mechanisms that defend against oxidative stress within the red blood cell are overwhelmed and the oxygen carrying ferrous ion (Fe2+) of the heme group of the hemoglobin molecule is oxidized to the ferric state (Fe3+). This converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, resulting in a reduced ability to release oxygen to tissues and thereby hypoxia. This can give the blood a bluish or chocolate-brown color. Spontaneously formed methemoglobin is normally reduced (regenerating normal hemoglobin) by protective enzyme systems, e.g., NADH methemoglobin reductase (cytochrome-b5 reductase) (major pathway), NADPH methemoglobin reductase (minor pathway) and to a lesser extent the ascorbic acid and glutathione enzyme systems. Disruptions with these enzyme systems lead to methemoglobinemia. Hypoxia occurs due to the decreased oxygen-binding capacity of methemoglobin, as well as the increased oxygen-binding affinity of other subunits in the same hemoglobin molecule, which prevents them from releasing oxygen at normal tissue oxygen levels.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of methemoglobinemia is made with the typical symptoms, a suggestive history, low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry measurements (SpO2) and these symptoms (cyanosis and hypoxia) failing to improve on oxygen treatment. The definitive test would be obtaining either CO-oximeter or a methemoglobin level on an arterial blood gas test.
Arterial blood with an elevated methemoglobin level has a characteristic chocolate-brown color as compared to normal bright red oxygen-containing arterial blood; the color can be compared with reference charts.

The SaO2 calculation in the arterial blood gas analysis is falsely normal, as it is calculated under the premise of hemoglobin either being oxyhemoglobin or deoxyhemoglobin. However, co-oximetry can distinguish the methemoglobin concentration and percentage of hemoglobin.
At the same time, the SpO2 concentration as measured by pulse ox is false high, because methemoglobin absorbs the pulse ox light at the 2 wavelengths it uses to calculate the ratio of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. For example with a methemoglobin level of 30–35%, this ratio of light absorbance is 1.0, which translates into a false high SpO2 of 85%.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other conditions that can cause bluish skin include argyria, sulfhemoglobinemia, heart failure, amiodarone-induced bluish skin pigmentation and acrodermatitis enteropathica.

==Treatment==

Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue. Methylene blue is given as a 1% solution (10 mg/ml) 1 to 2 mg/kg administered intravenously slowly over five minutes. Although the response is usually rapid, the dose may be repeated in one hour if the level of methemoglobin is still high one hour after the initial infusion. Methylene blue inhibits monoamine oxidase, and serotonin toxicity can occur if taken with an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medicine.

Methylene blue restores the iron in hemoglobin to its normal (reduced) oxygen-carrying state. This is achieved by providing an artificial electron acceptor (such as methylene blue or flavin) for NADPH methemoglobin reductase (RBCs usually don&#x27;t have one; the presence of methylene blue allows the enzyme to function at 5× normal levels). The NADPH is generated via the hexose monophosphate shunt.

Genetically induced chronic low-level methemoglobinemia may be treated with oral methylene blue daily. Also, vitamin C can occasionally reduce cyanosis associated with chronic methemoglobinemia, and may be helpful in settings in which methylene blue is unavailable or contraindicated (e.g., in an individual with G6PD deficiency). Diaphorase (cytochrome b5 reductase) normally contributes only a small percentage of the red blood cell&#x27;s reducing capacity, but can be pharmacologically activated by exogenous cofactors (such as methylene blue) to five times its normal level of activity.

==Epidemiology==
Methemoglobinemia mostly affects infants under 6 months of age (particularly those under 4 months) due to low hepatic production of methemoglobin reductase. The most at-risk populations are those with water sources high in nitrates, such as wells and other water that is not monitored or treated by a water treatment facility. The nitrates can be hazardous to the infants. The link between blue baby syndrome in infants and high nitrate levels is well established for waters exceeding the normal limit of 10 mg/L. However, there is also evidence that breastfeeding is protective in exposed populations.

==Society and culture==

===Blue Fugates===

The Fugates, a family that lived in the hills of Kentucky in the US, had the hereditary form. They are known as the &quot;Blue Fugates&quot;. Martin Fugate and Elizabeth Smith, who had married and settled near Hazard, Kentucky, around 1800, were both carriers of the recessive methemoglobinemia (met-H) gene, as was a nearby clan with whom the Fugates descendants intermarried. As a result, many descendants of the Fugates were born with met-H.

===Blue Men of Lurgan===
The &quot;blue men of Lurgan&quot; were a pair of Lurgan men suffering from what was described as &quot;familial idiopathic methemoglobinemia&quot; who were treated by James Deeny in 1942. Deeny, who would later become the Chief Medical Officer of the Republic of Ireland, prescribed a course of ascorbic acid and sodium bicarbonate. In case one, by the eighth day of treatments, there was a marked change in appearance, and by the twelfth day of treatment, the patient&#x27;s complexion was normal. In case two, the patient&#x27;s complexion reached normality over a month-long duration of treatment.

<text>The Kowloon Peninsula is a peninsula that forms the southern part of the main landmass in the territory of Hong Kong, alongside Victoria Harbour and facing toward Hong Kong Island. The Kowloon Peninsula and the area of New Kowloon are collectively known as Kowloon.

Geographically, the term &quot;Kowloon Peninsula&quot; may also refer to the area south of the mountain ranges of Beacon Hill, Lion Rock, Tate&#x27;s Cairn, Kowloon Peak, etc. The peninsula covers five of the eighteen districts of Hong Kong. Kowloon Bay is located at the northeast of the peninsula.

==Geology and reclamation==
The main rock type of the peninsula consists of a medium grained monzogranite with some fine granite outcrops, part of the Kowloon Granite. Early maps and photographs show flat, low-lying land behind the beach of Tsim Sha Tsui Bay with a raised area, Kowloon Hill, in the west.

The peninsula has been significantly expanded through land reclamation from the sea, over several phases. In the south and west most of the reclamation was carried out before 1904. Reclamation in several other small areas along the main Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront was completed by 1982. Since 1994, parts of the Hung Hom Bay were reclaimed and by 2019, it had been completely extinguished. The West Kowloon Reclamation was formed as part of the Airport Core Programme and largely completed by 1995.

==History==
Before the actual Kowloon boundaries were established, the Kowloon Peninsula served as one of the first destinations for escape during China&#x27;s dynastic times. In 1287, the last emperor of the Song dynasty, Emperor Bing was fleeing from the Mongol leader Kublai Khan. Taking refuge in a cave in the Kowloon peninsula, the inscription wrote &quot;Sung Wong Toi&quot; or &quot;Song Emperor&#x27;s Pavilion&quot;. In the 17th century, after the fall of the Ming dynasty, many of the Emperor&#x27;s followers also found shelter in the Kowloon peninsula to hide from the Manchus.

Historically speaking, Kowloon Peninsula refers to the ceded territories of Kowloon in 1860 as part of the Convention of Peking, but geographically it covers the entire Kowloon south of the mountain ranges of Lion Rock, Kowloon Peak and other hills. Kowloon Peninsula had a population of 800 when it was ceded to the British Empire in 1860.

In 1898 a resolution was passed by the Colonial Hong Kong Legislative Council to preserve the land where some of the caves stand.

<doc id="269035" wikidata="Q58093" url="?curid=269035" title="Cent (currency)">
<text>The cent is a monetary unit of many national currencies that equals a hundredth () of the basic monetary unit. The word derives from the Latin , &#x27;hundred&#x27;.

The cent sign is commonly a simple minuscule (lower case) letter . In North America, the c is crossed by a diagonal or vertical stroke (depending on typeface), yielding the character .

The United States one cent coin is generally known by the nickname &quot;penny&quot;, alluding to the British coin and unit of that name. Australia ended production of their 1c coin in 1990, New Zealand last produced their 1c coin in 1988, as did Canada in 2012. Some Eurozone countries ended production of the 1 euro cent coin, most recently Slovakia in 2022.

==Symbol==
The cent may be represented by the cent sign, written in various ways according to the national convention and font choice. Most commonly seen forms are a minuscule letter &quot;c&quot; crossed by a diagonal stroke, a vertical line, a simple &quot;c&quot;, depending on the currency (&quot;see below&quot;). Cent amounts from 1 to 99 can be represented as one or two digits followed by the appropriate abbreviation (2¢, 5c, 75¢, 99c), or as a subdivision of the base unit ($0.75, €0.99). In some countries, longer abbreviations like &quot;ct.&quot; are used. Languages that use other alphabets have their own abbreviations and conventions.

The cent symbol has largely fallen into disuse since the mid-20th century as inflation has resulted in very few things being priced in cents in any currency. It was included on US typewriter keyboards, but has not been adopted on computers.

===North American cent sign===
The cent sign appeared as the shift of the 6 keys on American manual typewriters, but the freestanding circumflex on computer keyboards has taken over that position. The character (offset 162) can still be created in most common code pages, including Unicode and Windows-1252:
* On DOS- or Windows-based computers with a numeric keypad, can be held while typing or on the keypad. See for techniques involving the hexadecimal code point that can be used when there is no numeric keypad, as on many laptops. For the US International keyboard can be typed.
* On Mac systems, can be held and on the number row pressed.
* On Unix/Linux systems with a compose key, and are typical sequences.

===Orthography===
When written in English and Mexican Spanish, the cent sign (¢ or c) follows the amount (with no space between)for example, 2¢ and $0.02, or 2c and €0.02. Conventions in other languages may vary.

==Usage==

<text>The cent is a logarithmic unit of measure used for musical intervals. Twelve-tone equal temperament divides the octave into 12 semitones of 100 cents each. Typically, cents are used to express small intervals, to check intonation, or to compare the sizes of comparable intervals in different tuning systems. For humans, a single cent is too small to be perceived between successive notes.

Cents, as described by Alexander John Ellis, follow a tradition of measuring intervals by logarithms that began with Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz in the 17th century. Ellis chose to base his measures on the hundredth part of a semitone, , at Robert Holford Macdowell Bosanquet&#x27;s suggestion. Making extensive measurements of musical instruments from around the world, Ellis used cents to report and compare the scales employed, and further described and utilized the system in his 1875 edition of Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s &quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot;. It has become the standard method of representing and comparing musical pitches and intervals.

==History==
Alexander John Ellis&#x27; paper &quot;On the Musical Scales of Various Nations&quot;, published by the &quot;Journal of the Society of Arts&quot; in 1885, officially introduced the cent system to be used in exploring, by comparing and contrasting, musical scales of various nations. The cent system had already been defined in his &quot;History of Musical Pitch&quot;, where Ellis writes: &quot;If we supposed that, between each pair of adjacent notes, forming an equal semitone [...], 99 other notes were interposed, making exactly equal intervals with each other, we should divide the octave into 1200 equal of an equal semitone, or &quot;cents&quot; as they may be briefly called.&quot;

Ellis defined the pitch of a musical note in his 1880 work &quot;History of Musical Pitch&quot; to be &quot;the number of double or complete vibrations, backwards and forwards, made in each second by a particle of air while the note is heard&quot;. He later defined musical pitch to be &quot;the pitch, or V [for &quot;double vibrations&quot;] of any named musical note which determines the pitch of all the other notes in a particular system of tunings.&quot; He notes that these notes, when sounded in succession, form the scale of the instrument, and an interval between any two notes is measured by &quot;the ratio of the smaller pitch number to the larger, or by the fraction formed by dividing the larger by the smaller&quot;. Absolute and relative pitches were also defined based on these ratios.

Ellis noted that &quot;the object of the tuner is to make the interval [...] between any two notes answering to any two adjacent finger keys throughout the instrument precisely the same. The result is called equal temperament or tuning, and is the system at present used throughout Europe. He further gives calculations to approximate the measure of a ratio in cents, adding that &quot;it is, as a general rule, unnecessary to go beyond the nearest whole number of cents.&quot;

Ellis presents applications of the cent system in this paper on musical scales of various nations, which include: (I. Heptatonic scales) Ancient Greece and Modern Europe, Persia, Arabia, Syria and Scottish Highlands, India, Singapore, Burmah and Siam,; (II. Pentatonic scales) South Pacific, Western Africa, Java, China and Japan. And he reaches the conclusion that &quot;the Musical Scale is not one, not &#x27;natural,&#x27; nor even founded necessarily on the laws of the constitution of musical sound, so beautifully worked out by Helmholtz, but very diverse, very artificial, and very capricious&quot;.

==Use==
A cent is a unit of measure for the ratio between two frequencies. An equally tempered semitone (the interval between two adjacent piano keys) spans 100 cents by definition. An octave—two notes that have a frequency ratio of 2:1—spans twelve semitones and therefore 1200 cents. The ratio of frequencies one cent apart is precisely equal to , the 1200th root of 2, which is approximately . Thus, raising a frequency by one cent corresponds to multiplying the original frequency by this constant value. Raising a frequency by 1200 cents doubles the frequency, resulting in its octave.

If one knows the frequencies formula_1 and formula_2 of two notes, the number of cents formula_3 measuring the interval from formula_1 to formula_2 is:

:formula_6

Likewise, if one knows formula_1 and the number of cents formula_3 in the interval from formula_1 to formula_2, then formula_2 equals:

:formula_12

=== Comparison of major third in just and equal temperament ===
The major third in just intonation has a frequency ratio 5:4 or ~386 cents, but in equal temperament is 400 cents. This 14 cent difference is about a seventh of a half step and large enough to be audible.

==Piecewise linear approximation==

As &quot;x&quot; increases from 0 to , the function 2&quot;x&quot; increases &quot;almost linearly&quot; from to , allowing for a piecewise linear approximation. Thus, although cents represent a logarithmic scale, small intervals (under 100 cents) can be &quot;loosely approximated&quot; with the linear relation 1 +  &quot;formula_3&quot; instead of the true exponential relation 2. The rounded error is zero when &quot;formula_3&quot; is 0 or 100, and is only about 0.72 cents high at &quot;formula_3=&quot;50 (whose correct value of 2 ≅  is approximated by 1 +  × 50 ≅ 1.02973). This error is well below anything humanly audible, making this piecewise linear approximation adequate for most practical purposes.

==Human perception==
It is difficult to establish how many cents are perceptible to humans; this precision varies greatly from person to person. One author stated that humans can distinguish a difference in pitch of about 5–6 cents. The threshold of what is perceptible, technically known as the just noticeable difference (JND), also varies as a function of the frequency, the amplitude and the timbre. In one study, changes in tone quality reduced student musicians&#x27; ability to recognize, as out-of-tune, pitches that deviated from their appropriate values by ±12 cents. It has also been established that increased tonal context enables listeners to judge pitch more accurately. &quot;While intervals of less than a few cents are imperceptible to the human ear in a melodic context, in harmony very small changes can cause large changes in beats and roughness of chords.&quot;

When listening to pitches with vibrato, there is evidence that humans perceive the mean frequency as the center of the pitch. One study of modern performances of Schubert&#x27;s Ave Maria found that vibrato span typically ranged between ±34 cents and ±123 cents with a mean of ±71 cents and noted higher variation in Verdi&#x27;s opera arias.

Normal adults are able to recognize pitch differences of as small as 25 cents very reliably. Adults with amusia, however, have trouble recognizing differences of less than 100 cents and sometimes have trouble with these or larger intervals.

==Other representations of intervals by logarithms==
===Octave===
The representation of musical intervals by logarithms is almost as old as logarithms themselves. Logarithms had been invented by Lord Napier in 1614. As early as 1647, Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz (1606-1682) in a letter to Athanasius Kircher described the usage of base-2 logarithms in music. In this base, the octave is represented by 1, the semitone by 1/12, etc.

===Heptamerides===
Joseph Sauveur, in his &quot;Principes d&#x27;acoustique et de musique&quot; of 1701, proposed the usage of base-10 logarithms, probably because tables were available. He made use of logarithms computed with three decimals. The base-10 logarithm of 2 is equal to approximately 0.301, which Sauveur multiplies by 1000 to obtain 301 units in the octave. In order to work on more manageable units, he suggests to take 7/301 to obtain units of 1/43 octave. The octave therefore is divided in 43 parts, named &quot;merides&quot;, themselves divided in 7 parts, the &quot;heptamerides&quot;. Sauveur also imagined the possibility to further divide each heptameride in 10, but does not really make use of such microscopic units.

===Savart===
Félix Savart (1791-1841) took over Sauveur&#x27;s system, without limiting the number of decimals of the logarithm of 2, so that the value of his unit varies according to sources. With five decimals, the base-10 logarithm of 2 is 0.30103, giving 301.03 savarts in the octave. This value often is rounded to 1/301 or to 1/300 octave.

===Prony===
Early in the 19th century, Gaspard de Prony proposed a logarithmic unit of base formula_16, where the unit corresponds to a semitone in equal temperament. Alexander John Ellis in 1880 describes a large number of pitch standards that he noted or calculated, indicating in pronys with two decimals, i.e. with a precision to the 1/100 of a semitone, the interval that separated them from a theoretical pitch of 370 Hz, taken as point of reference.

===Centitones===

A centitone (also Iring) is a musical interval (2, formula_17) equal to two cents (2) proposed as a unit of measurement () by Widogast Iring in &quot;Die reine Stimmung in der Musik&quot; (1898) as 600 steps per octave and later by Joseph Yasser in &quot;A Theory of Evolving Tonality&quot; (1932) as 100 steps per equal tempered whole tone.

Iring noticed that the Grad/Werckmeister (1.96 cents, 12 per Pythagorean comma) and the schisma (1.95 cents) are nearly the same (≈ 614 steps per octave) and both may be approximated by 600 steps per octave (2 cents). Yasser promoted the decitone, centitone, and millitone (10, 100, and 1000 steps per whole tone = 60, 600, and 6000 steps per octave = 20, 2, and 0.2 cents).

For example: Equal tempered perfect fifth = 700 cents = 175.6 savarts = 583.3 millioctaves = 350 centitones.

==Sound files==
The following audio files play various intervals. In each case the first note played is middle C. The next note is sharper than C by the assigned value in cents. Finally, the two notes are played simultaneously.

Note that the JND for pitch difference is 5–6 cents. Played separately, the notes may not show an audible difference, but when they are played together, beating may be heard (for example if middle C and a note 10 cents higher are played). At any particular instant, the two waveforms reinforce or cancel each other more or less, depending on their instantaneous phase relationship. A piano tuner may verify tuning accuracy by timing the beats when two strings are sounded at once.

, beat frequency = 0.16 Hz
, beat frequency = 1.53 Hz
, beat frequency = 3.81 Hz

<text>The history of the United States from 1945 to 1964 was a time of high economic growth and general prosperity. It was also a time of confrontation as the capitalist United States and its allies politically opposed the Soviet Union and other communist states; the Cold War had begun. African Americans united and organized, and a triumph of the civil rights movement ended Jim Crow segregation in the Southern United States. Further laws were passed that made discrimination illegal and provided federal oversight to guarantee voting rights.

In the period, an active foreign policy was pursued to help Western Europe and Asia recover from the devastation of World War II. The Marshall Plan helped Western Europe rebuild from wartime devastation. The main American goal was the Containment of communism. An arms race escalated through increasingly powerful nuclear weapons. The Soviets formed the Warsaw Pact of European satellites to oppose the American-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. The U.S. fought a bloody, inconclusive war in Korea and was escalating the war in Vietnam as the period ended. Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and when the USSR sent in nuclear missiles to defend it, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was triggered with the U.S., the most dangerous point of the era.

On the domestic front, after a short transition, the economy grew rapidly, with widespread prosperity, rising wages, and the movement of most of the remaining farmers to the towns and cities. Politically, the era was dominated by liberal Democrats who held together with the New Deal Coalition: Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945), Harry S. Truman (1945–1953), John F. Kennedy (1961–1963) and Lyndon Johnson (1963–1969). Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–1961) was a moderate who did not attempt to reverse New Deal programs such as regulation of business and support for labor unions; he expanded Social Security and built the interstate highway system. For most of the period, the Democrats controlled Congress; however, they were usually unable to pass as much liberal legislation as they had hoped because of the power of the Conservative Coalition. The Liberal coalition took control of Congress after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1963, and launched the Great Society.

This period of Post–World War II economic expansion witnessed the rapid growth of suburbs and a growing middle class.

==Cold War==

The Cold War (1945–1991) was the continuing state of political conflict, military tension, and economic competition between the Soviet Union and its satellite states, and the powers of the Western world, led by the United States. Although the primary participants&#x27; military forces never officially clashed directly, they expressed the conflict through military coalitions, strategic conventional force deployments, a nuclear arms race, espionage, proxy wars, propaganda, and technological competition, e.g., the Space Race.

===Origins===
While Roosevelt was confident he could cooperate with Stalin after the war, Truman was much more suspicious. The United States provided large-scale grants to Western Europe under the Marshall Plan (1948–1951), leading to a rapid economic recovery. The Soviet Union refused to allow its satellites to receive American aid. Instead, the Kremlin used local communist parties, and the Red Army, to control Eastern Europe in totalitarian fashion. Britain, in deep financial trouble, could no longer support Greece in its civil war with the communists. It asked the United States to take over aid to Greece. With bipartisan support in Congress, Truman responded with the Truman Doctrine in 1947. Truman followed the intellectual leadership of the State Department, which called for containment of Soviet communist expansion. The hope was that internal contradictions, such as diverse nationalism, would ultimately undermine Soviet ambitions.

By 1947, the Soviets had fully absorbed the three Baltic nations, and effectively controlled Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria. Austria and Finland were neutral and demilitarized. The Kremlin did not control Yugoslavia, which had a separate communist regime under Marshall Tito; They had a permanent bitter break in 1948. The Cold War lines stabilized in Europe along the Iron Curtain, and there was no fighting. The United States helped form a strong military alliance in NATO in 1949 including most of the nations of Western Europe, and Canada. In Asia, however, there was much more movement. The United States failed to negotiate a settlement between its ally, nationalist China under Chiang Kai-shek, and the communists under Mao Zedong. The communists took over China in 1949 and the nationalist government moved to the offshore island of Formosa (Taiwan), which came under American protection. Local communist movements attempted to take over all of Korea (1950) and Vietnam (1954). Communist hegemony covered one third of the world&#x27;s land while the United States emerged as the world&#x27;s more influential superpower, and formed a worldwide network of military alliances.

There were fundamental contrasts between the visions of the United States and the Soviet Union, between capitalist democracy and totalitarian communism. The United States envisioned the new United Nations as a Wilsonian tool to resolve future troubles, but it failed in that purpose. The U.S. rejected totalitarianism and colonialism, in line with the principles laid down by the Atlantic Charter of 1941: self-determination, equal economic access, and a rebuilt capitalist, democratic Europe that could again serve as a hub in world affairs.

===Containment===

For NATO, containment of the expansion of Soviet influence became foreign policy doctrine; the expectation was that eventually the inefficient Soviet system would collapse of internal weakness, and no &quot;hot&quot; war (that is, one with large-scale combat) would be necessary. Containment was supported by Republicans (led by Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, Governor Thomas Dewey of New York, and general Dwight D. Eisenhower), but was opposed by the isolationists led by Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio.

===1949–1953===
In 1949, the communist leader Mao Zedong won control of mainland China in a civil war, established the People&#x27;s Republic of China, then traveled to Moscow where he negotiated the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. China had thus moved from a close ally of the U.S. to a bitter enemy, and the two fought each other starting in late 1950 in Korea. The Truman administration responded with a secret 1950 plan, NSC 68, designed to confront the communists with large-scale defense spending. The Russians had built an atomic bomb by 1949, much sooner than expected. Truman then ordered the development of the hydrogen bomb. Two of the spies who gave atomic secrets to Russia were tried and executed.

France was hard-pressed by communist insurgents in the First Indochina War. The U.S. in 1950 started to fund the French effort on the proviso that the Vietnamese be given more autonomy.

===Korean War===

Stalin approved a North Korean plan to invade U.S.-supported South Korea in June 1950. President Truman immediately and unexpectedly implemented the containment policy by a full-scale commitment of American and UN forces to Korea. He did not consult or gain approval of Congress but did gain the approval of the United Nations (UN) to drive back the North Koreans and re-unite that country in terms of a rollback strategy. While originally a civil war, it quickly escalated into a proxy war between the United States and its allies and the communist powers of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

After a few weeks of retreat, on September 15 General Douglas MacArthur conducted an amphibious landing at the city of Inchon (Song Do port). The North Korean army collapsed, and within a few days, MacArthur&#x27;s army retook Seoul (South Korea&#x27;s capital). He then pushed north, capturing Pyongyang in October. This advantage was lost when hundreds of thousands of Chinese entered an undeclared war against the United States and pushed the US/UN/Korean forces back to the original starting line, the 38th parallel.

MacArthur planned for a full-scale invasion of China, but this was against the wishes of President Harry S. Truman and others who wanted a swift end to the war. As a result, Truman relieved MacArthur of command, replacing him with general Matthew Ridgway, who de-escalated the fighting to allow for a peace deal to be made. Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 campaigned against Truman&#x27;s failures of &quot;Korea, Communism and Corruption,&quot; promising to go to Korea himself and end the war. By threatening to use nuclear weapons in 1953, Eisenhower ended the war with a truce that is still in effect.

An armistice agreement was finally agreed to by the United Nations Command, the Korean People&#x27;s Army, and the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army on July 27, 1953. The war left 33,742 American soldiers dead, 92,134 wounded, and 80,000 missing in action (MIA) or prisoner of war (POW). Estimates place Korean and Chinese casualties at 1,000,000–1,400,000 dead or wounded, and 140,000 MIA or POW.

===Anti-communism and McCarthyism: 1947–1954===

In 1947, well before McCarthy became active, the Conservative Coalition in Congress passed the Taft–Hartley Act, designed to balance the rights of management and unions, and delegitimizing communist union leaders. The challenge of rooting out communists from labor unions and the Democratic Party was successfully undertaken by liberals, such as Walter Reuther of the autoworkers union and Ronald Reagan of the Screen Actors Guild (Reagan was a liberal Democrat at the time). Many of the purged leftists joined the presidential campaign in 1948 of FDR&#x27;s Vice President Henry A. Wallace.
The House Un-American Activities Committee, with young Congressman Richard M. Nixon playing a central role, accused Alger Hiss, a top Roosevelt aide, of being a communist spy, using testimony and documents provided by Whittaker Chambers. Hiss was convicted and sent to prison, with the anti-communists gaining a powerful political weapon. It launched Nixon&#x27;s meteoric rise to the Senate (1950) and the vice presidency (1952).

With anxiety over communism in Korea and China reaching fever pitch in 1950, a previously obscure Senator, Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, launched Congressional investigations into the cover-up of spies in the government. McCarthy dominated the media, and used reckless allegations and tactics that allowed his opponents to effectively counterattack. Irish Catholics (including conservative wunderkind William F. Buckley, Jr. and the Kennedy Family) were intensely anti-communist and defended McCarthy (a fellow Irish Catholic). Paterfamilias Joseph Kennedy (1888–1969), a very active conservative Democrat, was McCarthy&#x27;s most ardent supporter and got his son Robert F. Kennedy a job with McCarthy. McCarthy had talked of &quot;twenty years of treason&quot; (i.e. since Roosevelt&#x27;s election in 1932). When, in 1953, he started talking of &quot;21 years of treason&quot; and launched a major attack on the Army for promoting a communist dentist in the medical corps, his recklessness proved too much for Eisenhower, who encouraged Republicans to censure McCarthy formally in 1954. The Senator&#x27;s power collapsed overnight. Senator John F. Kennedy did not vote for censure. Buckley went on to found the &quot;National Review&quot; in 1955 as a weekly magazine that helped define the conservative position on public issues.

&quot;McCarthyism&quot; was expanded to include attacks on supposed communist influence in Hollywood, which resulted in the Hollywood blacklist, whereby artists who refused to testify about possible communist connections could not get work. Some famous celebrities (such as Charlie Chaplin) left the U.S.; other worked under pseudonyms (such as Dalton Trumbo). McCarthyism included investigations into academics and teachers as well. McCarthyism became a widespread social and cultural phenomenon that affected all levels of society and was the source of a great deal of debate and conflict in the United States. Investigating private citizens for alleged communist affiliations in government, private-industry and in the media produced widespread fear and destroyed the lives of many innocent American citizens. Using innuendo and intense interrogation methods, the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; produced blacklists in several industries. In the course of the anti-communist investigations in the early 1950s Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged in relation to the passing of information about the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union, and they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage. On June 19, 1953, they were both executed. Their execution was the first of civilians, for espionage, in United States history.

In addition to communists, and those in the entertainment industry, McCarthy also targeted homosexuals, particularly those employed in the State Department during the Lavender Scare--during the New Deal era, a significant amount of gays and lesbians had come to work in Washington, partially out of a desire to escape discrimination in small town America. Using Sumner Wells (the disgraced former Undersecretary of State to Franklin D. Roosevelt) as an example, McCarthy derided the effeminate, scandalous homosexuals who were allegedly controlling United States foreign relations. McCarthy also posed the suggestion that these homosexuals were a security risk to the United States, as their sexuality made them open to blackmail from the Soviet Union. Shortly after taking office in 1953, President Eisenhower passed an executive order banning homosexuals from Federal jobs. This prohibition remained in effect until 1977.

===Suez Crisis===

The Suez Crisis was a war fought over control of the Suez Canal. It followed the unexpected nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956 by Gamal Abdel Nasser, in which the United Kingdom, France, and Israel invaded to take control of the canal. The U.S. had strongly warned against military action. The operation was a military success, but the canal was blocked for years to come. Eisenhower demanded the invaders withdraw, and they did. This action was a major humiliation for Britain and France, two Western European countries, and symbolizes the beginning of the end of colonialism and the weakening of European global importance, specifically the collapse of the British Empire. The United States then became much more deeply involved in Middle Eastern politics, and remains so into the 21st century.

===Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations===
In 1953, Joseph Stalin died, and after the 1952 presidential election, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the opportunity to end the Korean War, while continuing Cold War policies. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was the dominant figure in the nation&#x27;s foreign policy in the 1950s. Dulles denounced the &quot;containment&quot; of the Truman administration and espoused an active program of &quot;liberation&quot;, which would lead to a &quot;rollback&quot; of communism. The most prominent of those doctrines was the policy of &quot;massive retaliation&quot;, which Dulles announced early in 1954, eschewing the costly, conventional ground forces characteristic of the Truman administration in favor of wielding the vast superiority of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and covert intelligence. Dulles defined this approach as &quot;brinkmanship&quot;.

A dramatic shock to Americans&#x27; self-confidence and its technological superiority came in 1957, when the Soviets beat the United States into outer space by launching Sputnik, the first earth satellite. The space race began, and by the early 1960s the United States had forged ahead, with President Kennedy promising to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s—the landing indeed took place on July 20, 1969.

Trouble close to home appeared when Fidel Castro took control of Cuba in 1959 and forged increasingly close ties with the Soviet Union, becoming communism&#x27;s center in Latin America. The United States responded with an economic boycott of Cuba, and a large-scale economic support program for Latin America under Kennedy, the Alliance for Progress.

East Germany was the weak point in the Soviet Empire, with refugees leaving for the West by the thousands every week. The Soviet solution came in 1961, with the Berlin Wall to stop East Germans from fleeing communism. This was a major propaganda setback for the USSR, but it did allow them to keep control of East Berlin.

The communist world split in half, as China turned against the Soviet Union; Mao denounced Khrushchev for going soft on capitalism. However, the US failed to take advantage of this split until President Richard Nixon saw the opportunity in 1969. In 1958, the U.S. sent troops into Lebanon for nine months to stabilize a country on the verge of civil war. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower dispatched large sums of economic and military aid and 695 military advisers to South Vietnam to stabilize the pro-western government under attack by insurgents. Eisenhower supported CIA efforts to undermine anti-American governments, which proved most successful in Iran and in Guatemala.

The first major strain among the NATO alliance occurred in 1956 when Eisenhower forced Britain and France to retreat from their invasion of Egypt (with Israel) which was intended to get back their ownership of the Suez Canal. Instead of supporting the claims of its NATO partners, the Eisenhower administration stated that it opposed French and British imperial adventurism in the region by sheer prudence, fearing that Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s standoff with the region&#x27;s old colonial powers would bolster Soviet power in the region.

The Cold War reached its most dangerous point during the Kennedy administration in the Cuban Missile Crisis, a tense confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The crisis began on October 16, 1962, and lasted for thirteen days. It was the moment when the Cold War was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations. Kennedy decided not to invade or bomb Cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island. The crisis ended in a compromise, with the Soviets removing their missiles publicly, and the United States secretly removing its nuclear missiles in Turkey. In Moscow, communist leaders removed Nikita Khrushchev because of his reckless behavior.

===Americas===

*In the 1950s, Latin America was the center of covert and overt conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Their varying collusion with national, populist, and elitist interests destabilized the region. The United States Central Intelligence Agency orchestrated the overthrow of the Guatemalan government (Operation PBSuccess) in 1952.
*In 1958, the military dictatorship of Venezuela was overthrown. This continued a pattern of regional revolution and warfare making extensive use of ground forces.
*In 1957, Dr. François Duvalier came to power in an election in Haiti. He later declared himself president for life, and ruled until his death in 1971.
*In 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew the regime of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, establishing a communist government in the country. Although Castro initially sought aid from the US, he was rebuffed and later turned to the Soviet Union.
*NORAD signed in 1959 by Canada and the United States creating a unified North American aerial defense system.

===Cuban Revolution===
The overthrow of Fulgencio Batista by Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and other forces in 1959 resulted in the creation of the first communist government in the western hemisphere. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 led to a confrontation between the United States, Cuba, and the Soviet Union.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia in February 1958 rebels on Sumatra and Sulawesi declared the PRRI-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the government of Sukarno. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received money, weapons, and manpower from the CIA. This support ended when Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958. In April 1958, the central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions on Padang and Manado, the rebel capitals. By the end of 1958, the rebels had been militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerrilla bands surrendered in August 1961.

==Society==

At the center of middle-class culture in the 1950s was a growing demand for consumer goods; a result of the postwar prosperity, the increase in variety and availability of consumer products, and television advertising. America generated a steadily growing demand for better automobiles, clothing, appliances, family vacations and higher education. After the initial hurdles of the 1945-48 period were overcome, Americans found themselves flush with cash from wartime work due to there being little to buy for several years. The result was a mass consumer spending spree, with a huge and voracious demand for new homes, cars, and housewares. Increasing numbers enjoyed high wages, larger houses, better schools, more cars and home comforts like vacuum cleaners, washing machines—which were all made for labor-saving and to make housework easier. Inventions familiar in the early 21st century made their first appearance during this era. The live-in maid and cook, common features of middle-class homes at the beginning of the century, were virtually unheard of in the 1950s; only the very rich had servants. Householders enjoyed centrally heated homes with running hot water. New style furniture was bright, cheap, and light, and easy to move around. As noted by John Kenneth Galbraith in 1958:

the ordinary individual has access to amenities – foods, entertainments, personal transportation, and plumbing – in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago.

===Economy===
Between 1945 and 1960, GNP grew by 250%, expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times, and consumption on personal services increased three times. By 1960, per capita income was 35% higher than in 1945, and America had entered what the economist Walt Rostow referred to as the &quot;high mass consumption&quot; stage of economic development. Short-term credit went up from $8.4 billion in 1946 to $45.6 billion in 1958. As a result of the postwar economic boom, 60% of the American population had attained a &quot;middle-class&quot; standard of living by the mid-1950s (defined as incomes of $3,000 to $10,000 in constant dollars), compared with only 31% in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. By the end of the decade, 87% of families owned a TV set, 75% owned a car, and 75% owned a washing machine. Between 1947 and 1960, the average real income for American workers increased by as much as it had in the previous half-century.

Prosperity and overall optimism made Americans feel that it was a good time to bring children into the world, and so a huge baby boom resulted during the decade following 1945 (the baby boom climaxed during the mid-1950s, after which time birthrates gradually declined until going below replacement level in 1965). Although the overall number of children per woman was not unusually high (averaging 2.3), they were assisted by improving technology that greatly brought down infant mortality rates versus the prewar era. Among other things, this resulted in an unprecedented demand for children&#x27;s products and a huge expansion of the public school system. The large size of the postwar baby-boom generation would have significant social repercussions in American society for decades to come.

In addition to the huge domestic market for consumer items, the United States became &quot;the world&#x27;s factory&quot;, as it was the only major power whose soil had been untouched by the war. American money and manufactured goods flooded into Europe, South Korea, and Japan and helped in their reconstruction. US manufacturing dominance would be almost unchallenged for a quarter-century after 1945.

The American economy grew dramatically in the post-war period, expanding at a rate of 3.5% per year between 1945 and 1970. During this period of prosperity, many incomes doubled in a generation, described by economist Frank Levy as &quot;upward mobility on a rocket ship.&quot; The substantial increase in average family income within a generation resulted in millions of office and factory workers being lifted into a growing middle class, enabling them to sustain a standard of living once considered to be reserved for the wealthy. As noted by Deone Zell, assembly-line work paid well, while unionized factory jobs served as &quot;stepping-stones to the middle class.&quot; By the end of the 1950s, 87% of all American families owned at least one T.V., 75% owned cars, and 60% owned their homes. By 1960, blue-collar workers had become the biggest buyers of many luxury goods and services. In addition, by the early-1970s, post-World War II American consumers enjoyed higher levels of disposable income than those in any other country.

The great majority of American workers who had stable jobs were well-off financially, while even non-union jobs were associated with rising paychecks, benefits, and obtained many of the advantages that characterized union work. An upscale working class came into being, as American blue-collar workers came to enjoy the benefits of home ownership, while high wages provided blue-collar workers with the ability to pay for new cars, household appliances, and regular vacations. By the 1960s, a blue-collar worker earned more than a manager did in the 1940s, despite the fact that the former&#x27;s relative position within the income distribution had not changed.

As noted by the historian Nancy Wierek:

In the postwar period, the majority of Americans were affluent in the sense that they were in a position to spend money on many things they wanted, desired, or chose to have, rather than on necessities alone.

As argued by the historians Ronald Edsforth and Larry Bennett:

By the mid-1960s, the majority of America&#x27;s organized working class who were not victims of the second Red Scare embraced, or at least tolerated, anti-communism because it was an integral part of the New American Dream to which they had committed their lives. Theirs was not an unobtainable dream; nor were their lives empty because of it. Indeed, for at least a quarter of century, the material promises of consumer-oriented Americanism were fulfilled in improvements in everyday life that made them the most affluent working class in American history.

Between 1946 and 1960, the United States witnessed a significant expansion in the consumption of goods and services. GNP rose by 36% and personal consumption expenditures by 42%, cumulative gains which were reflected in the incomes of families and unrelated individuals. While the number of these units rose sharply from 43.3 million to 56.1 million in 1960, a rise of almost 23%, their average incomes grew even faster, from $3,940 in 1946 to $6,900 in 1960, an increase of 43%. After taking inflation into account, the real increase was 16%. The dramatic rise in the average American standard of living was such that, according to sociologist George Katona:
:&quot;Today in this country minimum standards of nutrition, housing and clothing are assured, not for all, but for the majority. Beyond these minimum needs, such former luxuries as homeownership, durable goods, travel, recreation, and entertainment are no longer restricted to a few. The broad masses participate in enjoying all these things and generate most of the demand for them.&quot;

More than 21 million housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1960, and in the latter year 52% of consumer units in the metropolitan areas owned their own homes. In 1957, out of all the wired homes throughout the country, 96% had a refrigerator, 87% an electric washer, 81% a television, 67% a vacuum cleaner, 18% a freezer, 12% an electric or gas dryer, and 8% air conditioning. Car ownership also soared, with 72% of consumer units owning an automobile by 1960. From 1958 to 1964, the average weekly take-home pay of blue-collar workers rose steadily from $68 to $78 (in constant dollars). In a poll taken in 1949, 50% of all Americans said that they were satisfied with their family income, a figure that rose to 67% by 1969.

The period from 1946 to 1960 also witnessed a significant increase in the paid leisure time of working people. The forty-hour workweek established by the Fair Labor Standards Act in covered industries became the actual schedule in most workplaces by 1960, while uncovered workers such as farmworkers and the self-employed worked fewer hours than they had done previously, although they still worked much longer hours than most other workers. Paid vacations also came to be enjoyed by the vast majority of workers, with 91% of blue-collar workers covered by major collective bargaining agreements receiving paid vacations by 1957 (usually to a maximum of three weeks), while by the early-1960s virtually all industries paid for holidays and most did so for seven days a year. Industries catering to leisure activities blossomed as a result of most Americans enjoying significant paid leisure time by 1960, while many blue-collar and white-collar workers had come to expect to hold on to their jobs for life. This period saw the growth of motels along major highways, as well as amusement parks such as Disneyland, which opened in 1955.

Educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people were graduating from high schools and universities than elsewhere in the world, as hundreds of new colleges and universities opened every year. Tuition was kept low—it was free at California state universities. At the advanced level, American science, engineering, and medicine was world-famous. By the mid-1960s, the majority of American workers enjoyed the highest wage levels in the world, and by the late-1960s, the great majority of Americans were richer than people in other countries, except Sweden, Switzerland, and Canada. Educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people was at school and college than elsewhere in the world. As noted by the historian John Vaizey:

To strike a balance with the Soviet Union, it would be easy to say that all but the very poorest Americans were better off than the Russians, that education was better but the health service worse, but that above all the Americans had freedom of expression and democratic institutions

In regards to social welfare, the post-war era saw a considerable improvement in insurance for workers and their dependents against the risks of illness, as private insurance programs like Blue Cross and Blue Shield expanded. With the exception of farm and domestic workers, virtually all members of the labor force were covered by Social Security. In 1959, about two-thirds of the factory workers and three-fourths of the office workers were provided with supplemental private pension plans. In addition, 86% of factory workers and 83% of office workers had jobs that covered for hospital insurance while 59% and 61% had additional insurance for doctors. By 1969, the average White family income had risen to $10,953, while the average Black family income lagged behind at $7,255, revealing a continued racial disparity in income among various segments of the American population. The percentage of American students continuing their education after the age of fifteen was also higher than in most other developed countries, with more than 90% of 16-year-olds and around 75% of 17-year-olds in school in 1964–66.

Despite overall prosperity during the 1950s, Eisenhower was a budget hawk and pursued a conservative fiscal policy designed to pay down the government&#x27;s debts from two wars. He did not move to lower the 90% Federal income tax rates left over from World War II and there were three economic recessions over his presidency--a mild one in 1953-54 that followed up on the end of the Korean War and a bigger out that began in late 1957 and lasted through 1958. Another recession followed in 1960. Vice President Nixon blamed this on the president&#x27;s monetary policy and thought he should have loosened the money supply to stimulate economic growth--the sluggish US economy was extensively exploited by Democrats during the 1960 presidential election.

The recession lifted a month into Kennedy&#x27;s administration and by the fall of 1961 the economy had begun an unprecedented boom. In a December 1962 speech, he announced his plans to reduce the top marginal tax rate to 75%, which one GOP Congressman wryly dubbed &quot;the most Republican speech a president has made since McKinley&quot;. Although the president did not live to see his tax proposal passed, Lyndon Johnson quickly steered it through Congress, and by late 1965, real GDP growth was exceeding 6% a year. The US economy remained strong for the most part until the OPEC embargo in 1973.

===Cars===
Automobiles became much more available, after the low production runs in the Depression, followed by the moratorium on production during the Second World War, when factories produced Jeeps and other military transport vehicles instead of cars. Styles became flashier. Boxy and conservative in the first half of the decade, they became lower, longer, wider, and sleeker. Tail fins, chrome, and multicolor paint jobs characterized the late 1950s. It was the beginning of the end for the small auto manufacturers, which were crippled by the Ford-GM price war of 1953–1954. Studebaker went under; the others merged into American Motors, whose Rambler chugged into the 1960s.

Ford&#x27;s launch of the new Edsel in 1958 was hotly anticipated, but it was a lemon and was cancelled after only three years. The name &quot;Edsel&quot; became an icon of failure. The 1950s was also the decade when the popular sport Formula One started.

===Suburbia===

Very little housing had been built during the Great Depression and World War, except for emergency quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended on the availability of automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas an average of 316,000 new housing nonfarm units had been constructed each year from the 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 built annually from 1946 through 1955 in all areas, especially suburbs. The G.I. Bill guaranteed low cost loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. With 16,000,000 eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7,300 (equal to $84,000 in 2020). The construction industry kept prices low by standardization – for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators, and stoves allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, as local public officials race to build schools. The most famous development was Levittown, in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1,000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000. Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment. Growth of the suburbs was especially prominent in the Sunbelt regions of the country; one example of a suburb on the West Coast was Lakewood, California, built largely to serve family of aviation workers. Going hand-in-hand with suburban development was the rise of shopping malls, fast-food restaurants and coffee shops.

With Detroit turning out automobiles as fast as possible, city dwellers gave up cramped apartments for a suburban life style centered around children and housewives, with the male breadwinner commuting to work. Suburbia encompassed one-third of the nation&#x27;s population by 1960. The growth of suburbs was not only a result of postwar prosperity, but innovations of the single-family housing market with low interest rates on 20 and 30 year mortgages, and low down payments, especially for veterans. Meanwhile, the suburban population swelled because of the baby boom. Suburbs provided larger homes for larger families, security from urban living, privacy, and space for consumer goods.

===Science, technology, and futurism===
With the prosperity of the era, the prevailing social attitude was one of belief in science, technology, progress, and futurism, although there had been signs of this trend since the 1930s. There was comparatively little nostalgia for the prewar era and the overall emphasis was on having everything new and more advanced than before. Nonetheless, the social conformity and consumerism of the 1950s often came under attack from intellectuals (e.g. Henry Miller&#x27;s books &quot;The Air-Conditioned Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Sunday After The War&quot;) and there was a good deal of unrest fermenting under the surface of American society that would erupt during the following decade.

One of the key factors in postwar prosperity was a technology boom due to the experience of the war. Manufacturing had made enormous strides and it was now possible to produce consumer goods in quantities and levels of sophistication unseen before 1945. Acquisition of technology from occupied Germany also proved an asset, as it was sometimes more advanced than its American counterpart, especially in the optics and audio equipment fields. The typical automobile in 1950 was an average of $300 more expensive than the 1940 version, but also produced in twice the numbers. Luxury brands such as Cadillac, which had been largely hand-built vehicles only available to the rich, now became a mass-produced car within the price range of the upper middle-class.

The rapid social and technological changes brought about a growing corporatization of America and the decline of smaller businesses, which often suffered from high postwar inflation and mounting operating costs. Newspapers declined in numbers and consolidated, both due to the above-mentioned factors and the advent of TV news. The railroad industry, once one of the cornerstones of the American economy and an immense and often scorned influence on national politics, also suffered from the explosion in automobile sales and the construction of the interstate system. By the end of the 1950s, it was well into decline and by the 1970s became completely bankrupt, necessitating a takeover by the federal government. Smaller automobile manufacturers such as Nash, Studebaker, and Packard were unable to compete with the Big Three in the new postwar world and gradually declined into oblivion over the next fifteen years. Suburbanization caused the gradual movement of working-class people and jobs out of the inner cities as shopping centers displaced the traditional downtown stores. In time, this would have disastrous effects on urban areas.

Major technological events of this period include:

* The Miller–Urey experiment showed in 1953 that under simulated conditions resembling those thought to be possible to have existed shortly after Earth was first created, many of the basic organic molecules that form the building blocks of life are able to spontaneously form.
* Francis Crick, and James D. Watson, discovered the helical structure of DNA at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1953.
* Bruce C. Heezen discovered the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
* The first polio vaccine, developed by Dr. Jonas Salk, was introduced to the general public in 1955.
* The first organ transplants were done in Boston and Paris in 1954.
* The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy.
* Sputnik 1 was launched in 1957. The US then launched Explorer 1 three months later, beginning the space race.
* Fortran, perhaps the single most important milestone in the development of programming languages, was developed at IBM.
* The Kinsey Reports were published.
* NASA is organized.

===Poverty and inequality in the postwar era===

Despite the prosperity of the postwar era, a significant minority of Americans continued to live in poverty by the end of the 1950s. In 1947, 34% of all families earned less than $3,000 a year, compared with 22.1% in 1960. Nevertheless, between one-fifth to one-quarter of the population could not survive on the income they earned. The older generation of Americans did not benefit as much from the postwar economic boom especially as many had never recovered financially from the loss of their savings during the Great Depression. It was generally a given that the average 35-year-old in 1959 owned a better house and car than the average 65-year-old, who typically had nothing but a small Social Security pension for an income. Many blue-collar workers continued to live in poverty, with 30% of those employed in industry in 1958 receiving under $3,000 a year. In addition, individuals who earned more than $10,000 a year paid a lower proportion of their income in taxes than those who earned less than $2,000 a year. In 1947, 60% of black families lived below the poverty level (defined in one study as below $3000 in 1968 dollars), compared with 23% of white families. In 1968, 23% of black families lived below the poverty level, compared with 9% of white families. In 1947, 11% of white families were affluent (defined as above $10,000 in 1968 dollars), compared with 3% of black families. In 1968, 42% of white families were defined as affluent, compared with 21% of black families. In 1947, 8% of black families received $7000 or more (in 1968 dollars) compared with 26% of white families. In 1968, 39% of black families received $7,000 or more, compared with 66% of white families. In 1960, the median for a married man of blue-collar income was $3,993 for blacks and $5,877 for whites. In 1969, the equivalent figures were $5,746 and $7,452, respectively.

As Socialist leader Michael Harrington emphasized, there was still The Other America. Poverty declined sharply in the 1960s as the New Frontier and Great Society especially helped older people. The proportion below the poverty line fell almost in half from 22% in 1960 to 12% in 1970 and then leveled off.

===Rural life===
The farm population shrank steadily as families moved to urban areas, where on average they were more productive and earned a higher standard of living. Friedberger argues that the postwar period saw an accelerating mechanization of agriculture, combined with new and better fertilizers and genetic manipulation of hybrid corn. It made for greater specialization and greater economic risks for the farmer. With rising land prices many sold their land and moved to town, the old farm becoming part of a neighbor&#x27;s enlarged operation. Mechanization meant less need for hired labor; farmers could operate more acres even though they were older. The result was a decline in rural-farm population, with gains in service centers that provided the new technology. The rural non-farm population grew as factories were attracted by access to good transportation without the high land costs, taxes, unionization and congestion of city factory districts. Once remote rural areas such as the Missouri Ozarks and the North Woods of the upper Midwest, with a rustic life style and many good fishing spots, attracted retirees and vacationers.

==Culture==

===Key events===

* The popularity of television skyrocketed, particularly in the US, where 77% of households purchased their first TV set during the decade.
*The social mores about sex were particularly restrictive, characterized by strong taboos and a nervous attitude for prudish conformity, to the point that even the softcore pornography of the time avoided describing it. The social mores of the decade were marked by overall conservatism and conformity.
* &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; hits movie theaters launching a cycle of Hollywood films in which Cold War fears are manifested through scenarios of alien invasion or mutation.
* Resurgence of evangelical Christianity including Youth for Christ (1943); the National Association of Evangelicals, the American Council of Christian Churches, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (1950), Conservative Baptist Association of America (1947); and Campus Crusade for Christ (1951). &quot;Christianity Today&quot; was first published in 1956. 1956 also marked the beginning of Bethany Fellowship, a small press that grew to be a leading evangelical press.
* Carl Stuart Hamblen, a religious radio broadcaster, hosted the popular show &quot;The Cowboy Church of the Air&quot;.
*Hugh Hefner launched &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 1953.
* &quot;Disneyland&quot; opens in July 1955.

===Fine Arts===

Abstract expressionism was popular in New York City in the 1950s. This movement acquired its name for combining the German expressionism&#x27;s emotional intensity with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, Bauhaus and Synthetic Cubism. Jackson Pollock was one of the most influential painters of this movement, creating famous works such as No. 5, 1948.

Color Field painting and Hard-edge painting followed close on the heels of Abstract expressionism, and became the idiom for new abstraction in painting during the late 1950s. The term &quot;second generation&quot; was applied to many abstract artists who were related to but following different directions than the early abstract expressionists.

Bay Area Figurative Movement was an important return to figuration and a reaction against abstract expressionism by artists living and working on the West Coast in and around San Francisco during the mid-1950s.

=== Literature ===

The strong sexual taboos of mass culture were also reflected in literature, with the institutionally established modernist tradition, and most writers feeling compelled to self-censor themselves. This would clash with the Beat fiction which pushed the boundaries of what was considered allowed, causing a liberating and exciting cultural effect which encouraged other writers to free up. For this, the Beat movement was met with a series of censorships and law enforcement excesses.

 One of the most influential and most highly critically acclaimed of the many books about the era is &quot;The Fifties&quot; by journalist and author David Halberstam. 
Beatniks and the Beat Generation, an anti-materialistic literary movement whose name was invented by Jack Kerouac in 1948 and stretched on into the early-mid-1960s, was at its zenith in the 1950s. Such groundbreaking literature from the beats includes William S. Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;, and Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;. This decade is also marked by some of the most famous works of science fiction by science fiction writers Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Ray Bradbury, Theodore Sturgeon, A. E. van Vogt, and Robert A. Heinlein.

Though it was not published until 1960, John Updike&#x27;s &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; was written during and exemplifies the culture of the 1950s. The novel &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; by Richard Yates, published in 1961, is concerned with mid-1950s life and culture. Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, though not published until 1963, features a woman&#x27;s struggle living in 1950s American culture. Agatha Christie was also at a stage where she published at an average rate of one book every year.

In 1963, Betty Friedan published her book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; which ridiculed the housewife role of women during the postwar years; it was a best-seller and a major catalyst of the women&#x27;s liberation movement.

=== Fashion ===
The 1950s were a time of fashion evolution. At the beginning of the decade, fitted blouses and jackets with rounded (as opposed to puffy) shoulders and small, round collars were very popular. Narrow pant legs and capris became increasingly popular during this time, often worn with flats, ballet-inspired shoes, and Keds/Converse type sneakers. Thick, heavy heels were popular for low shoes. Socks were sometimes worn, but were not as necessary as they are now. Circle skirts (like the classic poodle skirt) were very popular. They were often hand decorated with various patterns or beads to make them unique and worn over petticoats. Shirt dresses with large, contrasting buttons were also stylish. Early 1950s women wore small hats over hair cut short, à la Audrey Hepburn.

As the 1950s progressed, so too did fashion, until, by the end of the 1950s, the Jackie Kennedy look was in style. A-lines and loose-fitting dresses became more and more popular, and jackets took on a boxy look. Kitten heels and metal/steel stilettos became the most popular shoe style. Flower-pot shaped hats overtook the small ones of earlier in the decade, and large hairstyles, such as that of Liz Taylor, were in.

Prosperity also brought about the development of a distinct youth culture for the first time, as teenagers were not forced to work and support their family at young ages like in the past. This had its culmination in the development of new music genres such as rock-and-roll as well as fashion styles and subcultures, the most famous of which was the &quot;greaser&quot;, a young male who drove motorcycles, sported ducktail haircuts (which were widely banned in schools) and displayed a general disregard for the law and authority. The greaser phenomenon was kicked off by the controversial youth-oriented movies &quot;The Wild One&quot; (1953) starring Marlon Brando and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955) starring James Dean.

===Music===
Popular music and Country music in the early 1950s featured vocalists like Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Frankie Laine, Patti Page, Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Judy Garland, Johnnie Ray, Kay Starr, Bill Monroe, Eddy Arnold, Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Rosemary Clooney, Édith Piaf, Charles Aznavour, Maurice Chevalier, Gene Autry, Tex Ritter, Jimmy Durante, Georgia Gibbs, Eddie Fisher, Pearl Bailey, Jim Reeves, Teresa Brewer, Dinah Shore, Sammy Davis Jr., Tennessee Ernie Ford, Loretta Lynn, Chet Atkins, Guy Mitchell, Nat King Cole, and vocal groups like The Mills Brothers, The Ink Spots, The Four Lads, The Four Aces, The Chordettes, The Jordanaires, and The Ames Brothers.

Jazz stars in the 1950s who came into prominence in their genres called Bebop, Hard bop, Cool jazz and the Blues, at this time included Lester Young, Ben Webster, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Art Tatum, Bill Evans, Ahmad Jamal, Oscar Peterson, Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, Art Blakey, Max Roach, the Miles Davis Quintet, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Charles, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone, and Billie Holiday.

Rock-n-Roll and Electric blues emerged in the mid-1950s as the teen music of choice. Elvis Presley was especially popular. Bill Haley, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Everly Brothers, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Conway Twitty, Johnny Horton, and Marty Robbins were Rockabilly musicians. Doo-wop was another popular genre at the time. Popular Doo Wop and Rock-n-Roll bands of the mid-to-late 1950s include The Platters, The Flamingos, The Dells, The Silhouettes, Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Danny &amp; the Juniors, The Coasters, The Drifters, The Del-Vikings and Dion and the Belmonts.

=== Theater ===

Musicals were an important and popular component to the American theater scene.
During the 1950s several Rodgers and Hammerstein musical shows were popular on Broadway in Manhattan, notably &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. The team of Lerner and Loewe created two popular Broadway musicals during the 1950s &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Other popular musicals of the 1950s include:&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, &quot;Kismet&quot;, &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, &quot;Fanny&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;, &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, &quot;Candide&quot;, &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;, &quot;The Music Man&quot;, and &quot;West Side Story&quot; among others.

During the 1950s, some important and award-winning dramas included: &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; by Tennessee Williams, &quot;The Crucible&quot; by Arthur Miller, &quot;Picnic&quot; by William Inge, &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; adapted from the novel by Vern Sneider by John Patrick, &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; by Joseph Hayes, &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; adapted from the book by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, &quot;Bus Stop&quot; by William Inge, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; by Tennessee Williams, &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; by Enid Bagnold, &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; by Eugene O&#x27;Neill, &quot;Separate Tables&quot; by Sir Terence Rattigan, &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; by Lorraine Hansberry, &quot;No Exit&quot; by Jean-Paul Sartre, &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot; by T. S. Eliot, &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; by Agatha Christie, &quot;The Waltz of the Toreadors&quot; by Jean Anouilh, &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; by John Osborne and &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; by Dore Schary, among others.

===Cinema===
With television&#x27;s growing popularity, there was a decline in movie revenues.

With the difficulties of World War II now in the past, the decade gave birth to what might be referred to as &quot;the suburban dream&quot; (the typical 1950s housewife would eventually become a universally recognised stereotype). Reflecting this were films such as the melodramas by director Douglas Sirk; &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955), &quot;There&#x27;s Always Tomorrow&quot; (1956), &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956) and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1959). Decades later, the themes of these films would be revisited with films such as &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002).

Musicals were still an enormously popular genre during the 1950s, although over the last thirty-five years or so, the musical film has declined in popularity. Many of the musical films of the 1950s and early 1960s, were straightforward adaptations or restagings of successful stage productions, some of those include the Rodgers and Hammerstein shows: &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, and &quot;South Pacific&quot;. Other popular musicals of the 1950s include &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; which starred Elvis Presley, &quot;High Society&quot;, &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, &quot;Gigi&quot;, &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot;, &quot;Funny Face&quot;, &quot;Calamity Jane&quot;, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, and many others.

The Walt Disney Studios enjoyed a decade of prosperity with animated feature-length films &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (Disney&#x27;s first wide-screen animated film), and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. The studio began producing live-action period and historical films such as &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot;, &quot;Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier&quot;, &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot;, &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, &quot;Light in the Forest&quot;, &quot;Tonka&quot;, and &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot;. The studio produced its first live-action contemporary comedy &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; in 1959 with Disney teen stars Annette Funicello and Tommy Kirk.

Established stars appeared in films that have come to be regarded as classics such as &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (Gloria Swanson), and (William Holden), &quot;All About Eve&quot; (Bette Davis), &quot;Vertigo&quot; (James Stewart) and (Kim Novak), &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon), &quot;High Noon&quot; (Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly), &quot;The Searchers&quot; (John Wayne), &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (Cary Grant), &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (Kirk Douglas) and (Anthony Quinn), &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (Gregory Peck), &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (Alec Guinness), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (Gene Kelly and Donald O&#x27;Connor), &quot;White Christmas&quot; (Bing Crosby), and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (Charlton Heston), a film which holds (with &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;) a record for most Academy Awards. The Stanislavski system&#x27;s theater-orientated, yet organic approach to acting influenced the work of film actors including Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando James Dean, and Paul Newman. Brando&#x27;s performances in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, &quot;The Wild One&quot;, and &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; influenced sales of T-shirts, leather jackets, and motorcycles.

=== Comics ===
Superhero comics during the 1950s, though not as popular as the previous decade (or the next), were still abundant. Some of the titles DC Comics published include &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Superboy Comics&quot;, &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (Superboy stories), &quot;Action Comics&quot; (Superman stories), &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (Batman stories) amongst others. &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; featured stories with Superman, Batman and Robin, and other superheroes combined together. Superman&#x27;s sweetheart Lois Lane received her own title also. Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics, had million-selling titles that featured the Human Torch, the Sub-Mariner, and Captain America.

Satire and humor during the 1950s were popular and abundant. &quot;MAD&quot;, the American humor magazine, was founded by editor Harvey Kurtzman and publisher William Gaines in 1952. Originally launched as a comic book before it became a magazine, it was widely imitated and influential, impacting not only satirical media but the entire cultural landscape of the 20th century. Other &quot;Mad comics&quot; imitators during the 1950s included &quot;Cracked&quot;, &quot;Sick&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Panic&quot;, produced by future &quot;Mad&quot; editor Al Feldstein.

=== Television ===

Television, a commodity virtually unheard of during the Second World War, was now prevalent in most American homes by the mid-to-late 1950s. Television also increasingly became a medium for which to advertise products.

==Civil rights movement==
Following the end of Reconstruction, many states adopted restrictive Jim Crow laws which enforced segregation of the races and the second-class status of African Americans. The Supreme Court in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896) accepted segregation as constitutional. Voting rights discrimination remained widespread through the 1950s. Fewer than 10% voted in the Deep South, although a larger proportion voted in the border states, and blacks in the northern urban areas had shifted wholesale to the Democrats during the New Deal era.

The return of many black soldiers following the end of World War II led a wave of racial violence to sweep through the south in 1945-46, becoming a national issue and prompting the Truman administration to focus increasingly on civil rights. The Fair Employment Practice Committee had been established in June 1941 via executive order by President Roosevelt to prevent discriminatory practices by the federal government in all war-related work; following the end of the war, Truman unsuccessfully petitioned to maintain a permanent committee. In 1947, the President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights drafted a report titled, &quot;To Secure These Rights&quot;, which outlined a ten-point agenda on civil rights reform. In 1948, as part of the Fair Deal, President Truman proposed a civil rights agenda to congress which included the elimination of the poll tax, a federal lynching ban, and the establishment of a civil rights division in the Department of Justice. While most of these proposals were rejected by Southern Democrats in Congress, Truman signed Executive orders 9980 and 9981 in July 1948, which outlawed segregation in the federal government and armed forces, respectively.

In September 1957, President Eisenhower signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first major civil rights legislation in nearly a century, paving way to climactic federal civil rights legislation in the 1960s.

===&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; and &quot;massive resistance&quot;===
In the early days of the Civil Rights Movement, litigation and lobbying were the focus of integration efforts. The U.S. Supreme Court decisions in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot; (1954); &quot;Powell v. Alabama&quot; (1932); &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; (1944); &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; (1948); &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; (1950); and &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot; (1950) led to a shift in tactics, and from 1955 to 1966, nonviolent direct action was the strategy—primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins, freedom rides, and social movements.

&quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot; was a landmark case of the United States Supreme Court which explicitly outlawed segregated public education facilities for blacks and whites, ruling so on the grounds that the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot; public education could never truly provide black Americans with facilities of the same standards available to white Americans. One hundred and one members of the United States House of Representatives and 19 Senators signed &quot;The Southern Manifesto&quot; condemning the Supreme Court decision as unconstitutional.

Governor Orval Eugene Faubus (Democrat) of Arkansas used the Arkansas National Guard to prevent school integration at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. President Eisenhower (Republican) nationalized state forces and sent in the US Army to enforce federal court orders. Governors Ross Barnett of Mississippi and George Wallace of Alabama physically blocked school doorways at their respective states&#x27; universities. Birmingham&#x27;s public safety commissioner Eugene T. &quot;Bull&quot; Connor advocated violence against freedom riders and ordered fire hoses and police dogs turned on demonstrators during the 1963 Birmingham Children&#x27;s Crusade. Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County, Alabama, loosed his deputies during the 1965 &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; event of the Selma to Montgomery march, injuring many of the marchers and personally menacing other protesters. Police all across the South arrested civil rights activists on trumped-up charges.

===Civil rights organizations===
Although they had white supporters and sympathizers, the Civil Rights Movement was designed, led, organized, and manned by African-Americans, who placed themselves and their families on the front lines in the struggle for freedom. Their heroism was brought home to every American through newspaper, and later, television reports as their peaceful marches and demonstrations were violently attacked by law enforcement. Officers used batons, bullwhips, fire hoses, police dogs, and mass arrests to intimidate the protesters. The second characteristic of the movement is that it was not monolithic, led by one or two men. Rather it was a dispersed, grass-roots campaign that attacked segregation in many different places using many different tactics. While some groups and individuals within the civil rights movement—such as Malcolm X—advocated Black Power, black separatism, or even armed resistance, the majority of participants remained committed to the principles of nonviolence, a deliberate decision by an oppressed minority to abstain from violence for political gain. Using nonviolent strategies, civil rights activists took advantage of emerging national network-news reporting, especially television, to capture national attention.

The leadership role of black churches in the movement was a natural extension of their structure and function. They offered members an opportunity to exercise roles denied them in society. Throughout history, the black church served as a place of worship and also as a base for powerful ministers, such as Congressman Adam Clayton Powell in New York City. The most prominent clergyman in the Civil Rights Movement was Martin Luther King Jr. and the top strategist was James Bevel; as &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1963 &quot;Man of the Year&quot;, King showed tireless personal commitment to black freedom and his strong leadership won him worldwide acclaim and the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.

Students and seminarians in both the South and the North played key roles in every phase of the movement. Church and student-led movements, such as the Nashville Student Movement, developed their own organizational and sustaining structures. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), founded in 1957, coordinated and raised funds, mostly from northern sources, for local protests and for the training of black leaders. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, founded in 1957, developed the &quot;jail-no-bail&quot; strategy. SNCC&#x27;s role was to develop and link sit-in campaigns and to help organize freedom rides, voter registration drives, and other protest activities. These three new groups often joined forces with existing organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), founded in 1942, and the National Urban League. The NAACP and its director, Roy Wilkins, provided legal counsel for jailed demonstrators, helped raise bail, and continued to test segregation and discrimination in the courts as it had been doing for half a century. CORE initiated the 1961 Freedom Rides which involved many SNCC members, and CORE&#x27;s leader James Farmer later became executive secretary of SNCC. 
The administration of President John F. Kennedy supported enforcement of desegregation in schools and public facilities. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy brought more than 50 lawsuits in four states to secure black Americans&#x27; right to vote. However, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, concerned about possible communist influence in the civil rights movement and personally antagonistic to King, used the FBI to discredit King and other civil rights leaders.

==Presidential administrations==

===Truman: 1945–1953===

Truman, a self-educated farm boy from Missouri, stood in sharp contrast to the urbane and imperious Roosevelt who kept personal control of all major decisions. Truman was a folksy, unassuming president who relied on his cabinet, remarking &quot;The buck stops here&quot; and &quot;If you can&#x27;t stand the heat, you better get out of the kitchen.&quot; He replaced nearly all of Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet, often with old friends from his Senate days.

===Truman administration and early postwar period===
An &quot;accidental&quot; president widely seen as a creature of the Teddy Pendergast machine in St. Louis, Harry Truman was not initially popular. Rationing of goods was officially ended in October 1945 but the transition back to a peacetime economy was difficult and marred by high inflation, raw materials shortages, serious labor strikes, and racial tensions--much like happened in 1919, white servicemen returning home from the war were unhappy at blacks being given their jobs in their absence. In the 1946 midterm elections, the Republican Party managed sweeping electoral gains and controlled both houses of Congress for the first time in 16 years via the electoral slogan &quot;Had enough?&quot; The new 80th Congress convened in early 1947 and promptly began clipping the wings of the New Deal. The anti-union Taft-Hartley Act was passed along with the 22nd Amendment, which barred future presidents from serving more than two terms. Leftover wartime taxes and other regulations were lowered or removed.

Truman&#x27;s prospects in the 1948 presidential election seemed dim, but he pulled off a surprise upset win via an aggressive populist campaign focused mainly on his home region in the Midwest, and aided by the uninspired Republican candidate New York governor and 1944 presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey. The brief Republican control of Congress ended and Democrats regained both houses in downballot races. The House remained under Democrat control until 1995 with the exception of two years in the 1950s and the Senate would remain Democrat for most of 1949 to &#x27;94. However, the political climate in the postwar years had decidedly shifted back to the center and away from the leftism of the New Deal era. Americans had tired of top-down government planning and there was a growing distrust of Soviet intentions and the large number of Soviet spies who infiltrated Washington D.C. during the FDR era. The postwar Congressional coalitions were more conservative and resisted some of Truman&#x27;s plans, including proposals for European-style social welfare programs.

The Kefauver hearings about country-wide organized crime and corruption, were held between 1950 and 1951. The Kefauver Committee, officially the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce, held all of America&#x27;s attention. It was the first committee made up of senators from around the country organized to not only gain a better understanding of how to fight organized crime, but also to expose organized crime for the conglomerate empire that it was. Headed by Estes Kefauver, the committee traveled the country, investigating all levels of corruption.

The defeat of America&#x27;s wartime ally in the Chinese Civil War brought a hostile Communist regime to China under Mao Zedong. Soon the US became bogged down fighting China in the Korean War, 1950–53. Corruption in Truman&#x27;s administration, which was linked to cabinet-level appointees and senior White House staff, was a central issue in the 1952 presidential campaign. Truman&#x27;s third term hopes were dashed by a poor showing in the 1952 primaries. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, the famous wartime general, won a landslide in the 1952 presidential election by campaigning against Truman&#x27;s failures in terms of &quot;Communism, Korea and Corruption.&quot;

===Eisenhower: 1953–1961===

Eisenhower had been a prospective presidential candidate since the end of World War II, and although he publicly announced himself a Republican, he declined the party&#x27;s offers to run in 1948. However, four years later, he reconsidered, in part because he believed the Democratic Party had had a monopoly on power for too long (control of the White House for 19 straight years and Congress for 16 of the last 19 years) and it was necessary to restore a proper two party balance. Also, the GOP in their desperation to regain power had begun supporting controversial figures such as Joseph McCarthy. As a national hero, Eisenhower carried every major demographic bloc and all states outside the South in the 1952 presidential election. He ended the Korean War, maintained the peace in Asia and the Middle East, and worked smoothly with NATO allies in Europe while keeping the policy of containing Communism rather than trying to roll it back.

The economy was generally healthy, apart from a sharp economic recession in 1958. Eisenhower remained popular and largely avoided partisan politics; he was reelected by a landslide in 1956. While frugal in budget matters he expanded Social Security and did not try to repeal the remaining New Deal programs.

The US federal government authorized the Interstate Highway Act in June 1956, and construction had begun by the fall of that same year. The originally planned set of highways took decades to complete. The interstate highway system (using a tax on gasoline) dramatically improved the nation&#x27;s transportation infrastructure. In long-term perspective the interstate highway system was a remarkable success, that has done much to sustain Eisenhower&#x27;s positive reputation. Although there were later objections to the negative impact of clearing neighborhoods in cities, the system has been well received. The railroad system for passengers and freight declined sharply, but the trucking expanded dramatically and the cost of shipping and travel fell sharply. Suburbanization became possible, with the rapid growth of easily accessible, larger, cheaper housing than was available in the overcrowded central cities. Tourism dramatically expanded as well, creating a demand for more service stations, motels, restaurants and visitor attractions. There was much more long-distance movement to the Sunbelt for winter vacations, or for permanent relocation, with convenient access to visits to relatives back home. In rural areas, towns and small cities off the grid lost out as shoppers followed the interstate, and new factories were located near them.

In both foreign and domestic policy Eisenhower remained on friendly terms with the Democrats, who regained Congress in 1954 and made large gains in 1958. His farewell address to the nation warned of the dangers of a growing &quot;military–industrial complex.&quot;

===Kennedy: 1961-1963===

====1960 presidential election====

The very close 1960 election pitted Republican Vice President Richard Nixon against the Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Historians have explained Kennedy&#x27;s victory in terms of an economic recession, the numerical dominance of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans, the votes that Kennedy gained among Catholics practically matched the votes Nixon gained among Protestants, Kennedy&#x27;s better organization and superior campaigning skills. Kennedy used his large, well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination, secure endorsements, and with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses, to get out the vote in the big cities. He relied on Johnson to hold the South and used television effectively. Kennedy was the first Catholic to run for president since Al Smith&#x27;s ill-fated campaign in 1928. Voters were polarized on religious grounds, but Kennedy&#x27;s election was a transforming event for Catholics, who finally realized they were accepted in America, and it marked the virtual end of anti-Catholicism as a political force.

====Presidency====
The Kennedy Family had long been leaders of the Irish Catholic wing of the Democratic Party; JFK was middle-of-the-road or liberal on domestic issues and conservative on foreign policy, sending military forces into Cuba and Vietnam. The Kennedy style called for youth, dynamism, vigor and an intellectual approach to aggressive new policies in foreign affairs. The downside was his inexperience in foreign affairs, standing in stark contrast to the vast experience of the president he replaced. He is best known for his call to civic virtue: &quot;And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.&quot; Kennedy was largely unsuccessful in domestic legislation and his initiatives were blocked by Congressional Democrats, many of them Southerners.

=====Assassination=====
President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald. The event proved to be one of the greatest psychological shocks to the American people in the 20th century and led to Kennedy being revered as a martyr and hero.

===Johnson, 1963–1969===
After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson served out the remainder of the term, using appeals to finish the job that Kennedy had started to pass a remarkable package of liberal legislation that he called the Great Society. Johnson used the full powers of the presidency to ensure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. These actions helped Johnson to win a historic landslide in the 1964 presidential election over conservative champion Senator Barry Goldwater. Johnson&#x27;s big victory brought an overwhelming liberal majority in Congress.

<text>María Guadalupe &quot;Lupe&quot; Villalobos Vélez (July 18, 1908 – December 14, 1944) was a Mexican actress, singer, and dancer during the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema.

Vélez began her career as a performer in Mexican vaudeville in the early 1920s. After moving to the United States, she made her first film appearance in a short in 1927. By the end of the decade, she was acting in full-length silent films and had progressed to leading roles in &quot;The Gaucho&quot; (1927), &quot;Lady of the Pavements&quot; (1928) and &quot;Wolf Song&quot; (1929), among others. Vélez made the transition to sound films without difficulty. She was one of the first successful Mexican actresses in Hollywood. During the 1930s, her explosive screen persona was exploited in successful comedic films like &quot;Hot Pepper&quot; (1933), &quot;Strictly Dynamite&quot; (1934) and &quot;Hollywood Party&quot; (1934). In the 1940s, Vélez&#x27;s popularity peaked while appearing as Carmelita Fuentes in eight &quot;Mexican Spitfire&quot; films, a series created to capitalize on her fiery personality.

Nicknamed &quot;The Mexican Spitfire&quot; by the media, Vélez had a personal life that was as colorful as her screen persona. She had several highly-publicized romances with Hollywood actors and a stormy marriage with Johnny Weissmuller. Vélez died at age 36 in December 1944 of an intentional overdose of the barbiturate drug Seconal. Her death and the circumstances surrounding it were the subject of speculation and controversy.

==Life and career==
===Childhood and education===
Vélez was born in the city of San Luis Potosí in Mexico, the daughter of Jacobo Villalobos Reyes, a colonel in the armed forces of the dictator Porfirio Diaz, and his wife Josefina Vélez, an opera singer according to some sources, or vaudeville singer according to others. She was one of five children; she had three sisters: Mercedes, Reina and Josefina and a brother, Emigdio. The Villalobos were considered a prominent, financially comfortable family in San Luis Potosí. According to Vélez&#x27;s second cousin, they lived in a large home, and most of the male members received a college education.

At the age of 13, her parents sent her to study at Our Lady of the Lake (now Our Lady of the Lake University) in San Antonio, Texas, where Vélez learned to speak English and dance. She later admitted that she liked dance class, but was otherwise a poor student.

===Beginnings in Mexico and arrival in the United States (1924–26)===

Vélez began her career in Mexican revues in the early 1920s. She initially performed under her paternal surname (see Hispanic American naming customs) of Villalobos, but after her father returned home from the war (he did not die in combat as some sources state), he was outraged that his daughter had decided to become a stage performer. She chose her maternal surname Vélez as her stage name.
Their mother introduced Vélez and her sister Josefina to the popular Spanish Mexican vedette María Conesa, &quot;La Gatita Blanca&quot;. Vélez debuted in a show led by Conesa, where she sang &quot;Oh Charley, My Boy&quot; and danced the shimmy. In 1924, Aurelio Campos, a young pianist and friend of the Vélez sisters, recommended Vélez to stage producers Carlos Ortega and Manuel Castro. Ortega and Castro were preparing a season revue at the Regis Theatre, and hired Vélez to join the company in March 1925. Later that year, Vélez starred in the revues &quot;Mexican Rataplan&quot; and &quot;¡No lo tapes!&quot; (both parodies of the Bataclan&#x27;s shows in Paris). Her suggestive singing and provocative dancing was a hit with audiences, and she soon established herself as one of the main stars of vaudeville in Mexico. After a year and a half, Vélez left the revue after the manager refused to give her a raise. She then joined the &quot;Teatro Principal&quot;, but was fired after three months due to her &quot;feisty attitude&quot;. Vélez was quickly hired by the &quot;Teatro Lirico&quot;, where her salary rose to 100 pesos a day.

Vélez, whose volatile and spirited personality and feuds with other performers were often covered by the Mexican press, also honed her ability for garnering publicity. Her most bitter rivals included the Mexican vedettes Celia Padilla, Celia Montalván, and Delia Magaña. Called &quot;La Niña Lupe&quot; because of her youth, Vélez soon established herself as one of the main stars of vaudeville in Mexico. Among her admirers were notable Mexican poets and writers like José Gorostiza and Renato Leduc.

In 1926, Frank A. Woodyard, an American who had seen Vélez perform, recommended her to stage director Richard Bennett (the father of actresses Joan and Constance Bennett). Bennett was looking for an actress to portray a Mexican cantina singer in his upcoming play &quot;The Dove&quot;. He sent Vélez a telegram inviting her to Los Angeles to appear in the play. Vélez had been planning to go to Cuba to perform, but quickly changed her plans and traveled to Los Angeles. However, upon arrival, she discovered that she had been replaced by another actress.

While in Los Angeles, she met the comedian Fanny Brice. Brice was taken with Vélez and later said she had never met a more fascinating personality. She promoted Vélez&#x27;s career as a dancer and recommended her to Flo Ziegfeld, who hired her to perform in New York City. While Vélez was preparing to leave Los Angeles, she received a call from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer producer Harry Rapf, who offered her a screen test. Producer and director Hal Roach saw Vélez&#x27;s screen test and hired her for a small role in the comic Laurel and Hardy short &quot;Sailors, Beware!&quot; She advanced to the ingenue role opposite Charley Chase in Roach&#x27;s two-reel comedy &quot;What Women Did for Me&quot; (1927).

===Breakthrough and success (1927–38)===
Later that year, she did a screen test for the upcoming Douglas Fairbanks full-length film &quot;The Gaucho&quot;. Fairbanks was impressed by Vélez and he quickly signed her to a contract. Upon its release in 1927, &quot;The Gaucho&quot; was a hit and critics were duly impressed with Vélez&#x27;s ability to hold her own with Fairbanks, who was well known for his spirited acting and impressive stunts.

Vélez made her second major film, &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; (1928), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. That same year, she was named one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars. In 1929, Vélez appeared in &quot;Lady of the Pavements&quot;, directed by D. W. Griffith and &quot;Where East Is East&quot;, playing a young Chinese woman. In the Western film &quot;Wolf Song&quot;, directed by Victor Fleming, she appears with Gary Cooper. As she was regularly cast as &quot;exotic&quot; or &quot;ethnic&quot; women that were volatile and hot-tempered, gossip columnists took to referring to Vélez as &quot;Mexican Hurricane&quot;, &quot;The Mexican Wildcat&quot;, &quot;The Mexican Madcap&quot;, &quot;Whoopee Lupe&quot; and &quot;The Hot Tamale&quot;.

By 1929, the film industry was transitioning from silents to sound films. Several stars of the era saw their careers abruptly end due to heavy accents or voices that recorded poorly. Studio executives predicted that Vélez&#x27;s accent would probably hamper her ability to make the transition. That idea was dispelled after she appeared in her first all-talking picture in 1929, the Rin Tin Tin vehicle &quot;Tiger Rose&quot;. The film was a hit and Vélez&#x27;s sound career was established.

With the arrival of talkies, Vélez appeared in a series of Pre-Code films like &quot;Hell Harbor&quot; (directed by Henry King), &quot;The Storm&quot; (1930, directed by William Wyler), and the crime drama &quot;East Is West&quot;, with Edward G. Robinson (1930). In 1931, she appeared in her second film for Cecil B. DeMille, &quot;Squaw Man&quot;, with Warner Baxter, and in &quot;Resurrection&quot;, directed by Edwin Carewe. In 1932, Vélez filmed &quot;The Cuban Love Song&quot; (1931), with the popular singer Lawrence Tibbett. That same year, she had a supporting role in &quot;Kongo&quot; (a sound remake of &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot;), with Walter Huston. She also starred in Spanish-language versions of some of her movies produced by Universal Studios like &quot;Resurrección&quot; (1931, the Spanish version of &quot;Resurrection&quot;), and &quot;Hombres en mi vida&quot; (1932, the Spanish version of &quot;Men in Her Life&quot;). Vélez found her niche in comedy, playing beautiful, volatile characters.

In February 1932, Vélez took a break from her film career and traveled to New York City where she was signed by Broadway impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. to take over the role of &quot;Conchita&quot; in the musical revue &quot;Hot-Cha!&quot;. The show also starred Bert Lahr, Eleanor Powell and Buddy Rogers.

In 1933, Vélez appeared in the films &quot;The Half-Naked Truth&quot; with Lee Tracy and &quot;Hot Pepper&quot;, with Victor McLaglen and Edmund Lowe. Later that year, she returned to Broadway where she starred with Jimmy Durante in the musical revue &quot;Strike Me Pink&quot;. She was reunited with Durante in three 1934 movie comedies, &quot;Palooka&quot;, &quot;Strictly Dynamite&quot; and, most famously, &quot;Hollywood Party&quot;. That same year, Vélez was cast as &quot;Slim Girl&quot; in &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; with Ramón Novarro. The film was quietly released and largely ignored. The few reviews it received panned the film, but praised Vélez&#x27;s performance. She had more success with her brief appearance in the all-comedy-cast film &quot;Hollywood Party&quot;, where she has an egg-breaking routine with Laurel and Hardy.

Although Vélez was a popular actress, MGM Studios did not renew her contract. Over the next few years, Vélez worked for various studios as a freelance actress; she also spent two years in England where she filmed &quot;The Morals of Marcus&quot; and &quot;Gypsy Melody&quot; (both 1936). She returned to Los Angeles the following year, where she signed with RKO for the Wheeler &amp; Woolsey comedy &quot;High Flyers&quot; (1937, featuring some of her celebrity impersonations).

Vélez&#x27;s last Broadway performance was in the 1938 musical &quot;You Never Know&quot;, by Cole Porter. The show received poor reviews from critics, but received a large amount of publicity due to the feud between Vélez and fellow cast member Libby Holman. Holman also was irritated by the attention Vélez garnered from the show with her impressions of several actresses, including Gloria Swanson, Katharine Hepburn, and Shirley Temple. The feud came to a head during a performance in New Haven, Connecticut after Vélez punched Holman between curtain calls and gave her a black eye. The feud effectively ended the show.

Upon her return to Mexico City in 1938 to star in her first Mexican film, Vélez was greeted by ten thousand fans. The film &quot;La Zandunga&quot; directed by Fernando de Fuentes, co-starring Mexican actor Arturo de Córdova, was a critical and financial success, and Vélez was slated to appear in four more Mexican films. She instead returned to Los Angeles and went back to work for RKO.

===Continued success and final roles (1939–44)===
In 1939, Vélez was cast with Leon Errol and Donald Woods in &quot;The Girl from Mexico&quot;. Despite being a low-budget B picture, it was a hit with audiences and RKO re-teamed her with Errol and Woods for the sequel &quot;Mexican Spitfire&quot;. That film was also a success and led to a series of &quot;Spitfire&quot; films (eight in all). In the series, Vélez portrays Carmelita Lindsay, a temperamental yet friendly Mexican singer married to Dennis &quot;Denny&quot; Lindsay (Woods), an elegant American advertising executive. The &quot;Spitfire&quot; films rejuvenated Vélez&#x27;s career. Moreover, they were films in which a Latina headlined for eight movies straight –a true rarity.

Lupe Vélez was Hollywood&#x27;s number-one Latina by this time, and producer-director Mark Sandrich asked her to headline a live stage show in Ensenada, Mexico. This was in preparation for the Hollywood Victory Caravan tour, and the March 22, 1942 show featured many of the Caravan participants: Laurel and Hardy, James Cagney, Desi Arnaz, Lucille Ball, and Joan Bennett, among others. Vélez emceed the show as well, addressing the audience of 2,500 Mexican servicemen in Spanish.

In addition to the &quot;Mexican Spitfire&quot; series, she was cast in other musical and comedy features for RKO, Universal Pictures, and Columbia Pictures. Some of these films were &quot;Six Lessons from Madame La Zonga&quot; (with Leon Errol, 1941), &quot;Playmates&quot; (with John Barrymore, 1941), and &quot;Redhead from Manhattan&quot; (1943). The last film has Vélez playing the dual role of a Broadway star and her visiting twin sister, and offers the viewer a rare chance to hear Lupe Vélez&#x27;s actual speaking voice. She plays the visiting sister with her customary, exaggerated Mexican accent, but plays the actress with her own, gently inflected voice, betraying only a trace of an accent.

In 1943, the final film in the &quot;Spitfire&quot; series, &quot;Mexican Spitfire&#x27;s Blessed Event&quot;, was released. By that time, the mistaken-identity scripts and situations had been repeating themselves, and the novelty of the series had begun to wane, but Vélez&#x27;s energy and Errol&#x27;s clowning never flagged.

Vélez co-starred with Eddie Albert in a 1943 romantic comedy, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot;, about an actress and a baseball player. In 1944, Vélez returned to Mexico to star in an adaptation of Émile Zola&#x27;s novel &quot;Nana&quot;, which was well received. It would be her final film. After filming wrapped, Vélez returned to Los Angeles and began preparing for another stage role in New York.

==Personal life==

===Public image and personality===

Throughout her career, Vélez&#x27;s onscreen persona of a hot-tempered, lusty &quot;wild&quot; woman was closely tied to her off-screen personality. The press often referred to her by such names as &quot;The Mexican Spitfire&quot;, &quot;The Mexican It girl&quot; and &quot;The Mexican Kitten&quot;. Publicly promoted with the &quot;Whoopee Lupe&quot; persona that tried to define her, she dismissed the idea that she was uncontrollably wild. In an interview, she said:

Vélez&#x27;s off-screen behavior blurred the line between her onscreen persona and her real personality. After her death, journalist Bob Thomas recalled that Vélez was a &quot;lively part of the Hollywood scene&quot; who wore loud clothing and made as much noise as possible. She attended boxing matches every Friday night at the Hollywood Legion Stadium and would stand on her ringside seat and scream at the fighters.

Vélez&#x27;s temper and jealousy in her often tempestuous romantic relationships were well documented and became tabloid fodder, often overshadowing her career. Vélez was straightforward with the press and was regularly contacted by gossip columnists for stories about her romantic exploits. One such incident included Vélez chasing her lover Gary Cooper around with a knife during an argument and cutting him severely enough to require stitches. After their breakup, Vélez attempted to shoot Cooper while he boarded a train. 
During her marriage to actor Johnny Weissmuller, stories of their frequent physical fights were regularly reported in the press. Vélez reportedly inflicted scratches, bruises, and love-bites on Weissmuller during their fights and &quot;passionate love-making&quot;.

Vélez often targeted fellow actresses whom she deemed rivals, professionally or otherwise, a habit which began back in her vaudeville days and continued in films.
Vélez&#x27;s image was that of a wild, highly sexualized woman who spoke her mind and was not considered a &quot;lady&quot;, while fellow Mexican actress Dolores del Río projected herself as sensual, but elegant and restrained, often hailing from aristocratic roots. Vélez hated del Río, and called her a &quot;bird of bad omen&quot;. Del Río was terrified to meet her in public places. When this happened, Vélez was scathing and aggressive. Vélez openly mimicked del Río, ironically making fun of her elegance. Vélez also disliked Marlene Dietrich whom she suspected of having an affair with Gary Cooper while filming &quot;Morocco&quot; in 1930. Her rivalries with Jetta Goudal, Lilyan Tashman and Libby Holman were well documented. In retaliation, Vélez would perform wicked impersonations of the women she disliked at Hollywood parties. She made these imitations part of her comic repertoire, exaggerating the facial and vocal mannerisms of Marlene Dietrich, Fanny Brice, Gloria Swanson, Katharine Hepburn, Simone Simon, and Shirley Temple.

===Relationships and marriage===
Lupe Vélez was involved in several highly publicized and often stormy relationships. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, she was linked to actors Tom Mix, Charlie Chaplin, and Clark Gable. Her first long-term, high-profile relationship was with Gary Cooper. Vélez and Cooper met while filming 1929s &quot;Wolf Song&quot; and began a two-year relationship that was passionate and often stormy. When angered, Vélez was reported to have physically assaulted Cooper. Cooper eventually ended the relationship in mid-1931, at the behest of his mother Alice who, after meeting her, strongly disapproved of Vélez. With plans to marry him gone, she spoke to the press in 1931: &quot;I turned Cooper down because his parents didn&#x27;t want me to marry him and because the studio thought it would injure his career. Now its over, I&#x27;m glad I feel so free ... I must be free. I know men too well they are all the same, no? If you love them they want to be boss. I will never have a boss.&quot; The rocky relationship had taken its toll on Cooper, who had lost 45 pounds and was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Paramount Pictures ordered him to take a vacation to recuperate and while he was boarding the train, Vélez showed up at the station and fired a pistol at him.

After her breakup with Cooper, Vélez began a short-lived relationship with actor John Gilbert. They began dating in late 1931 while Gilbert was separated from his third wife Ina Claire. Rumors of an engagement were fueled by the couple, but Gilbert ended the relationship in early 1932, and attempted to reconcile with Claire.
Shortly thereafter, Vélez met &quot;Tarzan&quot; actor Johnny Weissmuller while the two were in New York. They dated off and on when they returned to Los Angeles, while Vélez also dated actor Errol Flynn. On October 8, 1933, Vélez and Weissmuller were married in Las Vegas. There were reports of domestic violence and public fights. In July 1934, after ten months of marriage, Vélez filed for divorce citing &quot;cruelty&quot;. She withdrew the petition a week later after reconciling with Weissmuller. On January 3, 1935, she filed for divorce a second time and was granted an interlocutory decree. That decree was dismissed when the couple reconciled a month later. In August 1938, Vélez filed for divorce for a third time, again charging Weissmuller with cruelty. Their divorce was finalized in August 1939.

After the divorce became final, Vélez began dating actor/polo player Guinn &quot;Big Boy&quot; Williams in late 1940. The couple were engaged, but never married. In late 1941, she became involved with author Erich Maria Remarque. Actress Luise Rainer recalled that Remarque told her &quot;with the greatest of glee&quot; that he found Vélez&#x27;s volatility wonderful when he recounted to her an occasion where Vélez became so angry with him that she took her shoe off and hit him with it. After dating Remarque, Vélez was linked to boxers Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey.

In 1943, Vélez began an affair with her &quot;La Zandunga&quot; co-star Arturo de Córdova. De Córdova had recently moved to Los Angeles after signing with Paramount. Despite the fact that De Córdova was married to Mexican actress Enna Arana with whom he had four children, Vélez granted an interview to gossip columnist Louella Parsons in September 1943 and announced that the two were engaged. She told Parsons that she planned to retire after marrying De Córdova to &quot;cook ... and keep house&quot;. Vélez ended the engagement in early 1944, after de Córdova&#x27;s wife refused to give him a divorce.

Vélez then met and began dating a struggling young Austrian actor named Harald Maresch, whose stage name was Harald Ramond. In September 1944, she discovered she was pregnant with Ramond&#x27;s child. She announced their engagement in late November 1944. On December 10, four days before her death, Vélez announced she had ended the engagement and kicked Ramond out of her home.

==Death==
On the evening of December 13, 1944, Vélez dined with two friends, the silent-film star Estelle Taylor and Venita Oakie. In the early morning hours of December 14, Vélez retired to her bedroom, where she consumed 75 Seconal pills and a glass of brandy. Her secretary, Beulah Kinder, said that she found the actress&#x27;s body on her bed later that morning. A suicide note addressed to Harald Ramond was found nearby. It read:

To Harald, May God forgive you and forgive me too, but I prefer to take my life away and our baby&#x27;s before I bring him with shame or killing him. – Lupe.

On the back of the note, Vélez wrote:

How could you, Harald, fake such a great love for me and our baby when all the time, you didn&#x27;t want us? I see no other way out for me, so goodbye, and good luck to you, Love Lupe.

The day after Vélez&#x27;s death, Harald Ramond told the press that he was &quot;so confused&quot; by Vélez&#x27;s suicide, and claimed that even though the two had broken up, he had agreed to marry Vélez. He admitted that he once asked Vélez to sign an agreement stating that he was only marrying her to &quot;give the baby a name&quot;, but claimed he only did so because he and Vélez had had a fight, and he was in a &quot;terrible temper&quot;. Actress Estelle Taylor, who was with Vélez from 9:00 the previous night until 3:30 the morning Vélez died, told the press that Vélez had told her of her pregnancy, but said she would rather kill herself than have an abortion. Beulah Kinder, Vélez&#x27;s secretary, later told investigators that after Vélez broke off the relationship with Ramond, she planned to go to Mexico to have her baby. Kinder said Vélez soon changed her mind after concluding that Ramond &quot;faked&quot; the relationship and considered having an abortion.

The day after Vélez&#x27;s death, the Los Angeles County coroner requested that an inquest be opened to investigate the circumstances surrounding her death. On December 16, the coroner dropped the request, after determining that Vélez had written the notes, and that she had intended to kill herself. On December 22, a funeral for Vélez was held at the mortuary at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles. Among the pallbearers were Vélez&#x27;s ex-husband, Johnny Weissmuller, and actor Gilbert Roland. After the service, Vélez&#x27;s body was sent by train to Mexico City, where a second service was held on December 27. Her body was then interred at Panteón Civil de Dolores Cemetery.

===Alternative theories and urban legend===

Despite the coroner&#x27;s ruling that Vélez committed suicide to avoid the shame of bearing an illegitimate child, some authors have speculated that this was not entirely true.

In the book &quot;From Bananas to Buttocks: The Latina Body in Popular Film and Culture&quot;, Rosa-Linda Fregoso wrote that Vélez was known for her defiance of contemporary moral convention, and that it seems unlikely that she could not have reconciled having a child out of wedlock. Fregoso believes that in the final year of her life, Vélez exhibited signs of extreme mania and depression. Fregoso goes on to speculate that Vélez&#x27;s death may have been the result of an untreated mental illness such as bipolar disorder.

Robert Slatzer (who later claimed to have been secretly married to Marilyn Monroe) claimed that a few weeks before Vélez&#x27;s death, he interviewed her at her home, and she confided in him that she was pregnant with Gary Cooper&#x27;s child (by that time, Cooper was married to socialite Veronica &quot;Rocky&quot; Balfe). According to Slatzer, Vélez said that Cooper refused to acknowledge the child, believing that Harald Ramond was the father. After Vélez died, Slatzer said he asked Cooper about the situation, and Cooper confirmed that it was possible he might have been the father. Slatzer further claimed that he also interviewed Clara Bow (who had also dated Cooper in the 1920s), who revealed that shortly before Vélez&#x27;s death, Cooper called her and screamed that he was going to kill Harald Ramond for impregnating Vélez. Slatzer claimed that Bow told him that she never believed Vélez&#x27;s baby was fathered by Ramond, and that she was convinced that Vélez had attempted to get Ramond to marry her to protect Cooper&#x27;s reputation. Biographer Michelle Vogel speculated that if Cooper was the father, his rejection of Vélez and their child, coupled with the idea of having to raise a child alone, may have sent Vélez &quot;over the edge&quot;.

In the 2002 book &quot;Tarzan, My Father&quot;, Johnny Weissmuller, Jr., recounted the events surrounding Vélez&#x27;s death as a mystery caused by an attempt to &quot;put a lid&quot; on what happened. It states her housekeeper discovered her body and called Bo Roos, Vélez&#x27;s business manager, who called his friend and Beverly Hills Police Chief Anderson to the scene. The book states after Vélez arranged to meet Ramond, decorated her room, and dressed in a negligee, her ingestion of the barbiturate Seconal was either to calm her nerves before meeting him, or a failed dramatic gesture to scare him. The book also suggested the baby was fathered possibly by Cooper, not Ramond.

Vélez&#x27;s death was recounted by Kenneth Anger in his book &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, and has become urban legend. In Anger&#x27;s telling, Vélez planned to stage an elaborate suicide scene atop her satin bed, but the Seconal did not mix well with the &quot;Mexi-Spice Last Supper&quot; she had eaten earlier that evening. As a result, she became violently ill, stumbled to the bathroom to vomit, slipped on the bathroom floor tile, and fell head first into the toilet, where she subsequently drowned. Anger claimed that Vélez&#x27;s &quot;chambermaid&quot; Juanita found her the next morning. Despite the fact that his version of events contradicts published reports and the official ruling, his story is often repeated as fact or for comedic effect – it was recounted in the pilot episode of the television comedy series &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;The Good Son&quot;; referred to in an episode of the cartoon &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; and mentioned in the song &quot;I Wanna O.D.&quot; by the Demolition Doll Rods. Vélez&#x27;s biographer, Michelle Vogel, points out that it would have been &quot;virtually impossible&quot; for Vélez to have &quot;stumbled to the bathroom&quot; or even get off her bed after having consumed such a large amount of Seconal. This barbiturate is noted for being fast-acting even in small doses, and Vélez&#x27;s death was probably instantaneous. Her death certificate lists &quot;Seconal poisoning&quot; due to &quot;ingestion of Seconal&quot; as the cause of death, not drowning. Further, there was also no evidence to suggest Vélez had vomited. In 2013, the first publication of a police photo of Vèlez&#x27;s body on the floor of her bedroom was published.

==Legacy==
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Vélez has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 2017, artist Emilio Borjas&#x27;s sculpture in honor of Vélez was placed in the Garden of San Sebastian, the neighborhood where the actress was born in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

===Films and television===
* In 1949, the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; reported that the Puerto Rican dancer Marquita Rivera was chosen to star in a biographical film based on the life of the actress. However, due to the controversy over Vélez&#x27;s suicide at that time, the film was never produced. The Cuban rumbera Amalia Aguilar was also in talks to star in a film about Vélez, but later decided not to work in Hollywood, and returned to Mexico. In 1965 Latina actress Estelita Rodriguez, who had once played Spitfire-like ingenues for Republic Pictures, announced that she would star in a screen biography of Vélez, but the project died with Rodriguez in March 1966. 
* Andy Warhol&#x27;s underground film, &quot;Lupe&quot; (1965), starring Edie Sedgwick as Vélez, is loosely based on the night of her suicide. The film features Sedgwick (in her last film role for Warhol) preparing a &quot;beautiful suicide&quot; only to end up drowning in the toilet bowl.
* In August 2009, the short film &quot;Forever Lupe&quot; premiered at the Seattle Latino Film Festival. Directed by Martín Caballero, the film is based on the life of Vélez and features Mexican actress Marieli Romo as Vélez.
* In 2012, it was reported that Mexican director Carlos Carrera was preparing to film the life of Lupe Vélez in a Mexican-American production. Mexican actress Ana de la Reguera was chosen to play Vélez.
* Vélez is played by the Cuban-Venezuelan actress María Conchita Alonso in the 2014 film &quot;Return to Babylon&quot;.
* In the pilot episode of the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;The Good Son&quot;, Frasier Crane&#x27;s producer, Roz Doyle, tries to improve Frasier&#x27;s outlook on his life by telling him the story of Lupe Vélez, who she says &quot;decided to take one final stab at immortality&quot;. Roz re-tells the urban legend version of Vélez&#x27;s suicide, reminding Frasier that &quot;even though things might not happen like we planned, they can work out anyway&quot;. When Frasier asks &quot;how it worked out for Lupe&quot;, Roz tells him that &quot;all she wanted was to be remembered. Will you ever forget that story?&quot; Later in the episode, Frasier asks a caller to his radio show: &quot;Have you ever heard of the story of Lupe Vélez?&quot;
* In the 1997 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot;, guest star John Waters takes the Simpson family, sans Homer, on a driving tour of Springfield&#x27;s shopping district. During the tour, he points out a store where he claims Vélez bought the toilet she drowned in.

===Other media===
*Lupe Vélez was featured on the initial issue (no. 1) of the Italian puzzle weekly &quot;La Settimana Enigmistica&quot;, issued on January 23, 1932. This initiated the tradition, still continued presently by the publisher of the magazine, of featuring the picture of a star on the front page puzzle: a woman and a man on alternate weeks.

<doc id="269055" wikidata="Q79972" url="?curid=269055" title="James VI and I">
<text>James VI and I (James Charles Stuart; 19 June 1566 – 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death in 1625. Although he long tried to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, ruled by James in personal union. 

James was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. He acceded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was forced to abdicate in his favour. Four regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1589, he married Anne of Denmark. Three of their children survived to adulthood: Henry Frederick, Elizabeth, and Charles. In 1603, James succeeded his cousin Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland, who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known as the Jacobean era, until his death in 1625. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 1617, and styled himself &quot;King of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. He advocated for a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the Plantation of Ulster and English colonisation of the Americas began.

At 57 years and 246 days, James&#x27;s reign in Scotland was the longest of any Scottish monarch. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and conflicts with the English Parliament. Under James, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Elizabethan literature and drama continued, with writers such as William Shakespeare, John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture. James was a prolific writer, authoring works such as &quot;Daemonologie&quot; (1597), &quot;The True Law of Free Monarchies&quot; (1598), and &quot;Basilikon Doron&quot; (1599). He sponsored the translation of the Bible into English (later named after him, the Authorized King James Version), and the 1604 revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Contemporary courtier Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed &quot;the wisest fool in Christendom&quot; (wise in small things, foolish otherwise) an epithet associated with his character ever since. Since the latter half of the 20th century, historians have tended to revise James&#x27;s reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch. He was strongly committed to a peace policy, and tried to avoid involvement in religious wars, especially the Thirty Years&#x27; War that devastated much of Central Europe. He tried but failed to prevent the rise of hawkish elements in the English Parliament who wanted war with Spain. The first English king of the House of Stuart, he was succeeded by his second son, Charles I.

==Childhood==

===Birth===
James was the only son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. Mary and Darnley were great-grandchildren of Henry VII of England through Margaret Tudor, the older sister of Henry VIII. Mary&#x27;s rule over Scotland was insecure, and she and her husband, being Roman Catholics, faced a rebellion by Protestant noblemen. During Mary&#x27;s and Darnley&#x27;s difficult marriage, Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and conspired in the murder of the queen&#x27;s private secretary, David Rizzio, just three months before James&#x27;s birth.

James was born on 19 June 1566 at Edinburgh Castle, and as the eldest son and heir apparent of the monarch automatically became Duke of Rothesay and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. Five days later, the English diplomat Henry Killigrew saw the queen, who had not fully recovered and could only speak faintly. The baby was &quot;sucking at his nurse&quot; and was &quot;well proportioned and like to prove a goodly prince&quot;. He was baptised &quot;Charles James&quot; or &quot;James Charles&quot; on 17 December 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at Stirling Castle. His godparents were Charles IX of France (represented by John, Count of Brienne), Elizabeth I of England (represented by the Francis Russell, Earl of Bedford), and Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy (represented by ambassador Philibert du Croc). Mary refused to let the Archbishop of St Andrews, whom she referred to as &quot;a pocky priest&quot;, spit in the child&#x27;s mouth, as was then the custom. The subsequent entertainment, devised by Frenchman Bastian Pagez, featured men dressed as satyrs and sporting tails, to which the English guests took offence, thinking the satyrs &quot;done against them&quot;.

Lord Darnley was murdered on 10 February 1567 at Kirk o&#x27; Field, Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge for the killing of Rizzio. James inherited his father&#x27;s titles of Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her. In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in Lochleven Castle; she never saw her son again. She was forced to abdicate on 24 July 1567 in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother James Stewart, Earl of Moray, as regent. This made James the third consecutive Scottish monarch to ascend to the throne as an infant.

===Regencies===

The care of James was entrusted to the Earl and Countess of Mar, &quot;to be conserved, nursed, and upbrought&quot; in the security of Stirling Castle. James was anointed King of Scotland at the age of thirteen months at the Church of the Holy Rude in Stirling, by Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, on 29 July 1567. The sermon at the coronation was preached by John Knox. In accordance with the religious beliefs of most of the Scottish ruling class, James was brought up as a member of the Protestant Church of Scotland, the Kirk. The Privy Council selected George Buchanan, Peter Young, Adam Erskine (lay abbot of Cambuskenneth), and David Erskine (lay abbot of Dryburgh) as James&#x27;s preceptors or tutors. As the young king&#x27;s senior tutor, Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning. Buchanan sought to turn James into a God-fearing, Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy, as outlined in his treatise &quot;De Jure Regni apud Scotos&quot;.

In 1568, Mary escaped from Lochleven Castle, leading to several years of sporadic violence. The Earl of Moray defeated Mary&#x27;s troops at the Battle of Langside, forcing her to flee to England, where she was subsequently kept in confinement by Elizabeth. On 23 January 1570, Moray was assassinated by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh. The next regent was James&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Matthew Stewart, Earl of Lennox, who was carried fatally wounded into Stirling Castle a year later after a raid by Mary&#x27;s supporters. His successor, the Earl of Mar, &quot;took a vehement sickness&quot; and died on 28 October 1572 at Stirling. Mar&#x27;s illness, wrote James Melville, followed a banquet at Dalkeith Palace given by James Douglas, Earl of Morton.

Morton was elected to Mar&#x27;s office and proved in many ways the most effective of James&#x27;s regents, but he made enemies by his rapacity. He fell from favour when Frenchman Esmé Stewart, Sieur d&#x27;Aubigny, first cousin of James&#x27;s father Lord Darnley and future Earl of Lennox, arrived in Scotland and quickly established himself as the first of James&#x27;s powerful favourites. James was proclaimed an adult ruler in a ceremony of Entry to Edinburgh on 19 October 1579. Morton was executed on 2 June 1581, belatedly charged with complicity in Darnley&#x27;s murder. On 8 August, James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland. The king, then fifteen years old, remained under the influence of Lennox for about one more year.

==Rule in Scotland==
Lennox was a Protestant convert, but he was distrusted by Scottish Calvinists who noticed the physical displays of affection between him and the king and alleged that Lennox &quot;went about to draw the King to carnal lust&quot;. In August 1582, in what became known as the Ruthven Raid, the Protestant earls William Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie and Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus lured James into Ruthven Castle, imprisoned him, and forced Lennox to leave Scotland. On 19 September 1582, during James&#x27;s imprisonment, John Craig, whom the king had personally appointed royal chaplain in 1579, rebuked him so sharply from the pulpit for having issued a proclamation so offensive to the clergy &quot;that the king wept&quot;.

After James escaped from Falkland on 27 June 1583, he assumed increasing control of his kingdom. He pushed through the Black Acts to assert royal authority over the Kirk, and denounced the writings of his former tutor Buchanan. Between 1584 and 1603, he established effective royal government and relative peace among the lords, ably assisted by John Maitland of Thirlestane, who led the government until 1592. An eight-man commission known as the Octavians brought some control over the ruinous state of James&#x27;s finances in 1596, but it drew opposition from vested interests. It was disbanded within a year after a riot in Edinburgh, which was stoked by anti-Catholicism and led the court to withdraw to Linlithgow temporarily.

One last Scottish attempt against the king&#x27;s person occurred in August 1600, when James was apparently assaulted by Alexander Ruthven, the younger brother of John Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie at Gowrie House, the seat of the Ruthvens. Ruthven was run through by James&#x27;s page John Ramsay, and the Earl of Gowrie was killed in the ensuing fracas; there were few surviving witnesses. Given James&#x27;s history with the Ruthvens and the fact that he owed them a great deal of money, his account of the circumstances was not universally believed.

In 1586, James signed the Treaty of Berwick with England. That and his mother&#x27;s execution in 1587, which he denounced as a &quot;preposterous and strange procedure&quot;, helped clear the way for his succession south of the border. Queen Elizabeth was unmarried and childless, and James was her most likely successor. Securing the English succession became a cornerstone of his policy. During the Spanish Armada crisis of 1588, he assured Elizabeth of his support as &quot;your natural son and compatriot of your country&quot;. Elizabeth sent James an annual subsidy from 1586 which gave her some leverage over affairs in Scotland.

===Marriage===

Throughout his youth, James was praised for his chastity, since he showed little interest in women. After the loss of Lennox, he continued to prefer male company. A suitable marriage, however, was necessary to reinforce his rule, and the choice fell on fourteen-year-old Anne of Denmark, younger daughter of the Protestant Danish king Frederick II. Shortly after a proxy marriage in Copenhagen in August 1589, Anne sailed for Scotland but was forced by storms to the coast of Norway. On hearing that the crossing had been abandoned, James sailed from Leith with a 300-strong retinue to fetch Anne personally in what historian David Harris Willson called &quot;the one romantic episode of his life&quot;. The couple were married formally at the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Oslo on 23 November. James received a dowry of 75,000 Danish dalers and a gift of 10,000 dalers from his mother-in-law, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. After stays at Elsinore and Copenhagen and a meeting with Tycho Brahe, James and Anne returned to Scotland on 1 May 1590.

By all accounts, James was at first infatuated with Anne and, in the early years of their marriage, seems always to have shown her patience and affection. They attended the wedding celebrations of courtiers and danced in masque costume. The royal couple produced three children who survived to adulthood: Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died of typhoid fever in 1612, aged 18; Elizabeth, later queen of Bohemia; and Charles, James&#x27;s successor. 

Anne suffered from recurrent bouts of sickness and was seriously ill from 1617. James visited Anne only three times during her last illness. She died before her husband, in March 1619.

===Witch hunts===
James&#x27;s visit to Denmark, a country familiar with witch-hunts, sparked an interest in the study of witchcraft, which he considered a branch of theology. He attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the Witchcraft Act 1563. Several people were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James&#x27;s ship, most notably Agnes Sampson.

James became concerned with the threat posed by witches and wrote &quot;Daemonologie&quot; in 1597, a tract inspired by his personal involvement that opposed the practice of witchcraft and that provided background material for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. James personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. After 1599, his views became more sceptical. In a later letter written in England to his son Henry, James congratulates the prince on &quot;the discovery of yon little counterfeit wench. I pray God ye may be my heir in such discoveries ... most miracles now-a-days prove but illusions, and ye may see by this how wary judges should be in trusting accusations.&quot;

===Highlands and Islands===
The forcible dissolution of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV of Scotland in 1493 had led to troubled times for the western seaboard. James IV had subdued the organised military might of the Hebrides, but he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance. As a result, the 16th century became known as , the time of raids. Furthermore, the effects of the Reformation were slow to affect the , driving a religious wedge between this area and centres of political control in the Central Belt.

In 1540, James V had toured the Hebrides, forcing the clan chiefs to accompany him. There followed a period of peace, but the clans were soon at loggerheads with one another again. During James VI&#x27;s reign, the citizens of the Hebrides were portrayed as lawless barbarians rather than being the cradle of Scottish Christianity and nationhood. Official documents describe the peoples of the Highlands as &quot;void of the knawledge and feir of God&quot; who were prone to &quot;all kynd of barbarous and bestile cruelteis&quot;. The Gaelic language, spoken fluently by James IV and probably by James V, became known in the time of James VI as &quot;Erse&quot; or Irish, implying that it was foreign in nature. Parliament decided that Gaelic had become a principal cause of the Highlanders&#x27; shortcomings and sought to abolish it.

It was against this background that James VI authorised the &quot;Gentleman Adventurers of Fife&quot; to civilise the &quot;most barbarous Isle of Lewis&quot; in 1598. James wrote that the colonists were to act &quot;not by agreement&quot; with the local inhabitants, but &quot;by extirpation of thame&quot;. Their landing at Stornoway began well, but the colonists were driven out by local forces commanded by Murdoch and Neil MacLeod. The colonists tried again in 1605 with the same result, although a third attempt in 1607 was more successful. The Statutes of Iona were enacted in 1609, which required clan chiefs to provide support for Protestant ministers to Highland parishes; to outlaw bards; to report regularly to Edinburgh to answer for their actions; and to send their heirs to Lowland Scotland, to be educated in English-speaking Protestant schools. So began a process &quot;specifically aimed at the extirpation of the Gaelic language, the destruction of its traditional culture and the suppression of its bearers.&quot;

In the Northern Isles, James&#x27;s cousin Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, resisted the Statutes of Iona and was consequently imprisoned. His natural son Robert led an unsuccessful rebellion against James, and the Earl and his son were hanged. Their estates were forfeited, and the Orkney and Shetland islands were annexed to the Crown.

===Theory of monarchy===
In 1597–98, James wrote &quot;The True Law of Free Monarchies&quot; and &quot;Basilikon Doron&quot; (&quot;Royal Gift&quot;), in which he argues a theological basis for monarchy. In the &quot;True Law&quot;, he sets out the divine right of kings, explaining that kings are higher beings than other men for Biblical reasons, though &quot;the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon&quot;. The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by royal prerogative but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would &quot;stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings&quot;.

&quot;Basilikon Doron&quot; was written as a book of instruction for the four-year-old Prince Henry and provides a more practical guide to kingship. The work is considered to be well written and perhaps the best example of James&#x27;s prose. James&#x27;s advice concerning parliaments, which he understood as merely the king&#x27;s &quot;head court&quot;, foreshadows his difficulties with the English House of Commons: &quot;Hold no Parliaments,&quot; he tells Henry, &quot;but for the necesitie of new Lawes, which would be but seldome&quot;. In the &quot;True Law&quot;, James maintains that the king owns his realm as a feudal lord owns his fief, because kings arose &quot;before any estates or ranks of men, before any parliaments were holden, or laws made, and by them was the land distributed, which at first was wholly theirs. And so it follows of necessity that kings were the authors and makers of the laws, and not the laws of the kings.&quot;

===Literary patronage===
In the 1580s and 1590s, James promoted the literature of his native country. He published his treatise &quot;Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody&quot; in 1584 at the age of 18. It was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue of Scots, applying Renaissance principles. He also made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, seeing the two in connection. One act of his reign urges the Scottish burghs to reform and support the teaching of music in &quot;Sang Sculis&quot;.

In furtherance of these aims, James was both patron and head of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians known as the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie among others, Montgomerie being a favourite of the king. James was himself a poet, and was happy to be seen as a practising member of the group.

By the late 1590s, James&#x27;s championing of native Scottish tradition was reduced to some extent by the increasing likelihood of his succession to the English throne. William Alexander and other courtier poets started to anglicise their written language, and followed the king to London after 1603. James&#x27;s role as active literary participant and patron made him a defining figure in many respects for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which reached a pinnacle of achievement in his reign, but his patronage of the high style in the Scottish tradition, which included his ancestor James I of Scotland, became largely sidelined.

==Accession in England==
From 1601, in the last years of Elizabeth&#x27;s life, certain English politicians—notably her chief minister Robert Cecil—maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. With the queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne in March 1603. Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March, and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day.

On 5 April, James left Edinburgh for London, promising to return every three years (a promise that he did not keep), and progressed slowly southwards. Local lords received him with lavish hospitality along the route and James was amazed by the wealth of his new land and subjects, claiming that he was &quot;swapping a stony couch for a deep feather bed&quot;. James arrived in the capital on 7 May, nine days after Elizabeth&#x27;s funeral. His new subjects flocked to see him, relieved that the succession had triggered neither unrest nor invasion. On arrival at London, he was mobbed by a crowd of spectators.

James&#x27;s English coronation took place on 25 July at Westminster Abbey. An outbreak of plague restricted festivities. The Royal Entry to London with elaborate allegories provided by dramatic poets such as Thomas Dekker and Ben Jonson was deferred to 15 March 1604. Dekker wrote that &quot;the streets seemed to be paved with men; stalls instead of rich wares were set out with children; open casements filled up with women&quot;.

The kingdom to which James succeeded, however, had its problems. Monopolies and taxation had engendered a widespread sense of grievance, and the costs of war in Ireland had become a heavy burden on the government, which had debts of £400,000.

==Early reign in England, King of Great Britain==

James survived two conspiracies in the first year of his reign in England, despite the smoothness of the succession and the warmth of his welcome: the Bye Plot and Main Plot, which led to the arrest of Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham and Walter Raleigh, among others. Those hoping for a change in government from James were disappointed at first when he kept Elizabeth&#x27;s Privy Councillors in office, as secretly planned with Cecil, but James soon added long-time supporter Henry Howard and his nephew Thomas Howard to the Privy Council, as well as five Scottish nobles.

In the early years of James&#x27;s reign, the day-to-day running of the government in England was tightly managed by the shrewd Cecil, later Earl of Salisbury, ably assisted by the experienced Thomas Egerton, whom James made Baron Ellesmere and Lord Chancellor, and by Thomas Sackville, soon Earl of Dorset, who continued as Lord Treasurer. As a consequence, James was free to concentrate on bigger issues, such as a scheme for a closer union between England and Scotland and matters of foreign policy, as well as to enjoy his leisure pursuits, particularly hunting.

James was ambitious to build on the personal union of Scotland and England to establish a single country under one monarch, one parliament, and one law, a plan that met opposition from both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. &quot;Hath He not made us all in one island,&quot; James told the English Parliament, &quot;compassed with one sea and of itself by nature indivisible?&quot; In April 1604, however, the Commons refused his request to be titled &quot;King of Great Britain&quot; on legal grounds. In October 1604, he assumed the title &quot;King of Great Britain&quot; instead of &quot;King of England&quot; and &quot;King of Scotland&quot;, though Francis Bacon told him that he could not use the style in &quot;any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance&quot; and the title was not used on English statutes. James forced the Scottish Parliament to use it, and it was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, and treaties in both realms.

James achieved more success in foreign policy. Never having been at war with Spain, he devoted his efforts to bringing the long Anglo–Spanish War to an end, and a peace treaty was signed between the two countries in August 1604, thanks to the skilled diplomacy of the delegation, in particular Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, now Earl of Northampton. James celebrated the treaty by hosting a great banquet. Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them.

===Gunpowder Plot===

A dissident Catholic, Guy Fawkes, was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings on the night of 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James&#x27;s first English Parliament. Fawkes was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which he intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, &quot;not only ... of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general&quot;. The sensational discovery of the &quot;Gunpowder Plot&quot;, as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons. The Earl of Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth. Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed.

==King and Parliament==

The co-operation between monarch and Parliament following the Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, it was the previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. &quot;I will not thank where I feel no thanks due&quot;, he had remarked in his closing speech. &quot;... I am not of such a stock as to praise fools ... You see how many things you did not well ... I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come&quot;.

As James&#x27;s reign progressed, his government faced growing financial pressures, partly due to creeping inflation but also to the profligacy and financial incompetence of James&#x27;s court. In February 1610, Salisbury proposed a scheme, known as the Great Contract, whereby Parliament, in return for ten royal concessions, would grant a lump sum of £600,000 to pay off the king&#x27;s debts plus an annual grant of £200,000. The ensuing prickly negotiations became so protracted that James eventually lost patience and dismissed Parliament on 31 December 1610. &quot;Your greatest error&quot;, he told Salisbury, &quot;hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall&quot;. The same pattern was repeated with the so-called &quot;Addled Parliament&quot; of 1614, which James dissolved after a mere nine weeks when the Commons hesitated to grant him the money he required. James then ruled without parliament until 1621, employing officials such as the merchant Lionel Cranfield, who were astute at raising and saving money for the crown, and sold baronetcies and other dignities, many created for the purpose, as an alternative source of income.

===Spanish match===

Another potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.

The policy was supported by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats—together known as the Spanish Party—but deeply distrusted in Protestant England. When Walter Raleigh was released from imprisonment in 1616, he embarked on a hunt for gold in South America with strict instructions from James not to engage the Spanish. Raleigh&#x27;s expedition was a disastrous failure, and his son Walter was killed fighting the Spanish. On Raleigh&#x27;s return to England, James had him executed to the indignation of the public, who opposed the appeasement of Spain. James&#x27;s policy was further jeopardised by the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, especially after his Protestant son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, was ousted from Bohemia by the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620, and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick&#x27;s Rhineland home territory. Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son-in-law. The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick, and on the other—remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on Spanish gold shipments—called for a war directly against Spain. In November 1621, roused by Edward Coke, they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws. James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment, which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech. Urged on by George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and the Spanish ambassador Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, Count of Gondomar, James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.

In early 1623, Prince Charles, now 22, and Buckingham decided to seize the initiative and travel to Spain incognito, to win Infanta Maria Anna directly, but the mission proved an ineffectual mistake. Maria Anna detested Charles, and the Spanish confronted them with terms that included the repeal of anti-Catholic legislation by Parliament. Though a treaty was signed, Charles and Buckingham returned to England in October without the infanta and immediately renounced the treaty, much to the delight of the British people. Disillusioned by the visit to Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James&#x27;s Spanish policy upon its head and called for a French match and a war against the Habsburg empire. To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, the outpouring of anti-Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy was shifting from James to Charles and Buckingham, who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Lionel Cranfield, by now made Earl of Middlesex, when he opposed the plan on grounds of cost. The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare or fund a war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to finance a war against Spain, a stance that was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.

==King and Church==

After the Gunpowder Plot, James sanctioned harsh measures to control English Catholics. In May 1606, Parliament passed the Popish Recusants Act, which could require any subject to take an Oath of Allegiance denying the pope&#x27;s authority over the king. James was conciliatory towards Catholics who took the Oath of Allegiance, and tolerated crypto-Catholicism even at court. Henry Howard, for example, was a crypto-Catholic, received back into the Catholic Church in his final months. On ascending the English throne, James suspected that he might need the support of Catholics in England, so he assured Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, a prominent sympathiser of the old religion, that he would not persecute &quot;any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law&quot;.

In the Millenary Petition of 1603, the Puritan clergy demanded the abolition of confirmation, wedding rings, and the term &quot;priest&quot;, among other things, and that the wearing of cap and surplice become optional. James was strict in enforcing conformity at first, inducing a sense of persecution amongst many Puritans; but ejections and suspensions from livings became rarer as the reign continued. As a result of the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, some Puritan demands were acceded to in the 1604 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, though many remained displeased. The conference also commissioned a new translation and compilation of approved books of the Bible to resolve discrepancies among different translations then being used. The King James Version, as it came to be known, was completed in 1611 and is considered a masterpiece of Jacobean prose. It is still in widespread use.

In Scotland, James attempted to bring the Scottish Kirk &quot;so neir as can be&quot; to the English church and to reestablish episcopacy, a policy that met with strong opposition from presbyterians. James returned to Scotland in 1617 for the only time after his accession in England, in the hope of implementing Anglican ritual. James&#x27;s bishops forced his Five Articles of Perth through a General Assembly the following year, but the rulings were widely resisted. James left the church in Scotland divided at his death, a source of future problems for his son.

==Personal relationships==

Throughout his life James had close relationships with male courtiers, which has caused debate among historians about their exact nature. In Scotland Anne Murray was known as the king&#x27;s mistress. After his accession in England, his peaceful and scholarly attitude contrasted strikingly with the bellicose and flirtatious behaviour of Elizabeth, as indicated by the contemporary epigram (Elizabeth was King, now James is Queen).

Some of James&#x27;s biographers conclude that Esmé Stewart, Duke of Lennox; Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset; and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, were his lovers. John Oglander observed that he &quot;never yet saw any fond husband make so much or so great dalliance over his beautiful spouse as I have seen King James over his favourites, especially the Duke of Buckingham&quot; whom the king would, recalled Sir Edward Peyton, &quot;tumble and kiss as a mistress&quot;. Restoration of Apethorpe Palace, Northamptonshire, undertaken in 2004–08 revealed a previously unknown passage linking the bedchambers of James and Villiers.

Some biographers of James argue that the relationships were not sexual. James&#x27;s &quot;Basilikon Doron&quot; lists sodomy among crimes &quot;ye are bound in conscience never to forgive&quot;, and James&#x27;s wife Anne gave birth to seven live children, as well as suffering two stillbirths and at least three other miscarriages. Contemporary Huguenot poet Théophile de Viau observed that &quot;it is well known that the king of England / fucks the Duke of Buckingham&quot;. Buckingham himself provides evidence that he slept in the same bed as the king, writing to James many years later that he had pondered &quot;whether you loved me now ... better than at the time which I shall never forget at Farnham, where the bed&#x27;s head could not be found between the master and his dog&quot;. Buckingham&#x27;s words may be interpreted as non-sexual, in the context of 17th-century court life, and remain ambiguous despite their fondness. It is also possible that James was bisexual.

When the Earl of Salisbury died in 1612, he was little mourned by those who jostled to fill the power vacuum. Until Salisbury&#x27;s death, the Elizabethan administrative system over which he had presided continued to function with relative efficiency; from this time forward, however, James&#x27;s government entered a period of decline and disrepute. Salisbury&#x27;s passing gave James the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State, with his young Scottish favourite Robert Carr carrying out many of Salisbury&#x27;s former duties, but James&#x27;s inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism.

The Howard party (consisting of Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton; Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk; Suffolk&#x27;s son-in-law William Knollys, Lord Knollys; Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham; and Thomas Lake) soon took control of much of the government and its patronage. Even the powerful Carr fell into the Howard camp, hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Thomas Overbury for assistance with government papers. Carr had an adulterous affair with Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk. James assisted Frances by securing an annulment of her marriage to free her to marry Carr, now Earl of Somerset.

In summer 1615, however, it emerged that Overbury had been poisoned. He had died on 15 September 1613 in the Tower of London, where he had been placed at the king&#x27;s request. Among those convicted of the murder were the Earl and Countess of Somerset; the Earl had been replaced as the king&#x27;s favourite in the meantime by Villiers. James pardoned the Countess and commuted the Earl&#x27;s sentence of death, eventually pardoning him in 1624. The implication of the king in such a scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished James&#x27;s court with an image of corruption and depravity. The subsequent downfall of the Howards left Villiers unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1619.

==Health and death==
In his later years, James suffered increasingly from arthritis, gout and kidney stones. He also lost his teeth and drank heavily. The king was often seriously ill during the last year of his life, leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure, rarely able to visit London, while Buckingham consolidated his control of Charles to ensure his own future. One theory is that James suffered from porphyria, a disease of which his descendant George III exhibited some symptoms. James described his urine to physician Théodore de Mayerne as being the &quot;dark red colour of Alicante wine&quot;. The theory is dismissed by some experts, particularly in James&#x27;s case, because he had kidney stones which can lead to blood in the urine, colouring it red.

In early 1625, James was plagued by severe attacks of arthritis, gout, and fainting fits, and fell seriously ill in March with tertian ague and then suffered a stroke. He died at Theobalds House in Hertfordshire on 27 March during a violent attack of dysentery, with Buckingham at his bedside. James&#x27;s funeral on 7 May was a magnificent but disorderly affair. Bishop John Williams of Lincoln preached the sermon, observing, &quot;King Solomon died in Peace, when he had lived about sixty years ... and so you know did King James&quot;. The sermon was later printed as &quot;Great Britain&#x27;s Salomon&quot; .

James was buried in Westminster Abbey. The position of the tomb was lost for many years until his lead coffin was found in the Henry VII vault, during an excavation in the 19th century.

==Legacy==
James was widely mourned. For all his flaws, he had largely retained the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era. &quot;As he lived in peace&quot;, remarked the Earl of Kellie, &quot;so did he die in peace, and I pray God our king [Charles I] may follow him&quot;. The Earl prayed in vain: once in power, King Charles I and the Duke of Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure. James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth I.

Under James, the Plantation of Ulster by English and Scots Protestants began, and the English colonisation of North America started its course with the foundation of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607 and Cuper&#x27;s Cove, Newfoundland, in 1610. During the next 150 years, England would fight with Spain, the Netherlands, and France for control of the continent, while religious division in Ireland between Protestants and Catholics has lasted for 400 years. By actively pursuing more than just a personal union of his realms, James helped lay the foundations for a unitary British state.

According to a tradition originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James&#x27;s taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established the foundations of the English Civil War. James bequeathed his son Charles a fatal belief in the divine right of kings, combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles I and the abolition of the monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king&#x27;s reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.

Other influential anti-James histories written during the 1650s include: Edward Peyton&#x27;s &quot;Divine Catastrophe of the Kingly Family of the House of Stuarts&quot; (1652); Arthur Wilson&#x27;s &quot;History of Great Britain, Being the Life and Reign of King James I&quot; (1658); and Francis Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Historical Memoirs of the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James&quot; (1658). David Harris Willson&#x27;s 1956 biography continued much of this hostility. In the words of historian Jenny Wormald, Willson&#x27;s book was an &quot;astonishing spectacle of a work whose every page proclaimed its author&#x27;s increasing hatred for his subject&quot;. Since Willson, however, the stability of James&#x27;s government in Scotland and in the early part of his English reign, as well as his relatively enlightened views on religion and war, have earned him a re-evaluation from many historians, who have rescued his reputation from this tradition of criticism.

Representative of the new historical perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft&#x27;s overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms&#x27; financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown&#x27;s interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate lack of attention to the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James&#x27; reigns, including the legacy—now understood to be more troubled—which he left Charles I.

==Titles, styles, honours, and arms==
===Titles and styles===
In Scotland, James was &quot;James the sixth, King of Scotland&quot;, until 1604. He was proclaimed &quot;James the first, King of England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith&quot; in London on 24 March 1603. On 20 October 1604, James issued a proclamation at Westminster changing his style to &quot;King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.&quot; The style was not used on English statutes, but was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, treaties, and in Scotland. James styled himself &quot;King of France&quot;, in line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1801, although he did not actually rule France.

===Arms===
As King of Scotland, James bore the ancient royal arms of Scotland: Or, a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counter-flory Gules. The arms were supported by two unicorns Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lys a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or. The crest was a lion sejant affrontée Gules, imperially crowned Or, holding in the dexter paw a sword and in the sinister paw a sceptre both erect and Proper.

The Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland under James was symbolised heraldically by combining their arms, supporters and badges. Contention as to how the arms should be marshalled, and to which kingdom should take precedence, was solved by having different arms for each country.

The arms used in England were: Quarterly, I and IV, quarterly 1st and 4th Azure three fleurs de lys Or (for France), 2nd and 3rd Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland, this was the first time that Ireland was included in the royal arms). The supporters became: dexter a lion rampant guardant Or imperially crowned and sinister the Scottish unicorn. The unicorn replaced the red dragon introduced by the Tudors. The unicorn has remained in the royal arms of the two united realms. The English crest and motto was retained. The compartment often contained a branch of the Tudor rose, with shamrock and thistle engrafted on the same stem. The arms were frequently shown with James&#x27;s personal motto, &quot;Beati pacifici&quot;.

The arms used in Scotland were: Quarterly, I and IV Scotland, II England and France, III Ireland, with Scotland taking precedence over England. The supporters were: dexter a unicorn of Scotland imperially crowned, supporting a tilting lance flying a banner Azure a saltire Argent (Cross of Saint Andrew) and sinister the crowned lion of England supporting a similar lance flying a banner Argent a cross Gules (Cross of Saint George). The Scottish crest and motto was retained, following the Scottish practice the motto &quot;In defens&quot; (which is short for &quot;In My Defens God Me Defend&quot;) was placed above the crest.

As royal badges James used: the Tudor rose, the thistle (for Scotland; first used by James III of Scotland), the Tudor rose dimidiated with the thistle ensigned with the royal crown, a harp (for Ireland) and a fleur de lys (for France).

==Issue==

James&#x27;s queen, Anne of Denmark, gave birth to seven children who survived beyond birth, of whom three reached adulthood:

# Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (19 February 1594 – 6 November 1612). Died, probably of typhoid fever, aged 18.
# Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia (19 August 1596 – 13 February 1662). Married 1613 Frederick V, Elector Palatine. Died aged 65.
# Margaret (24 December 1598 – March 1600). Died aged 1.
# Charles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland (19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649). Married 1625 Henrietta Maria of France. Succeeded James I &amp; VI.
# Robert, Duke of Kintyre (18 January 1602 – 27 May 1602). Died aged 4 months.
# Mary (8 April 1605 – 16 December 1607). Died aged 2.
# Sophia (June 1606). Died within 48 hours of birth.

<doc id="269067" wikidata="Q1226318" url="?curid=269067" title="Diner">
<text>A diner is a type of restaurant found across the United States and Canada, as well as parts of Western Europe and Australia. Diners offer a wide range of cuisine, mostly American cuisine, a casual atmosphere, and, characteristically, a combination of booths served by a waitstaff and a long sit-down counter with direct service, in the smallest simply by a cook. Many diners have extended hours, and some along highways and areas with significant shift work stay open for 24 hours.

Considered quintessentially American, many diners share an archetypal exterior form. Some of the earliest were converted rail dining cars, retaining their streamlined structure and interior fittings. From the 1920s to the 1940s, diners, by then commonly known as &quot;lunch cars&quot;, were usually prefabricated in factories, like modern mobile homes, and delivered on site with only the utilities needing to be connected. As a result, many early diners were typically small and narrow to fit onto a rail car or truck. This small footprint also allowed them to be fitted into tiny and relatively inexpensive lots that otherwise were unable to support a larger enterprise. Diners were historically small businesses operated by the owner, with some presence of restaurant chains evolving over time.

Diners typically serve staples of American cuisine such as hamburgers, hot dogs, club sandwiches, french fries, onion rings, and other simple, quickly cooked, and inexpensive fare, such as meatloaf or steak. Much of the food is grilled, as early diners were based around a gas-fueled flattop grill. Coffee is a diner staple. Diners often serve milkshakes and desserts such as pies, cake or ice cream. Comfort food cuisine draws heavily from, and is deeply rooted in, traditional diner fare. Along with greasy spoon menu items, many diners will serve regional cuisine as well, such as clam chowder in New England and tacos in California.

Classic American diners often have an exterior layer of stainless steel siding—a feature unique to diner architecture. In some cases, diners share nostalgic, retro-style features also found in some restored drive-ins and old movie theatres.

==History==
A crude precursor of the diner was created in 1872 by Walter Scott, who sold food out of a horse-pulled wagon to employees of the &quot;Providence Journal&quot;, in Providence, Rhode Island. Scott&#x27;s diner can be considered the first diner with walk-up service, as it had windows on each side of the wagon. Commercial production of such &quot;lunch wagons&quot; began in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1887, by Thomas Buckley. Buckley was successful and became known for his &quot;White House Cafe&quot; wagons. Charles Palmer received the first patent (1893) for the diner, which he billed as a &quot;Night-Lunch Wagon&quot;. He built his &quot;fancy night cafes&quot; and &quot;night lunch wagons&quot; in the Worcester area until 1901.

===Prefabricated diners===
As the number of seats increased, wagons gave way to pre-fabricated buildings made by many of the same manufacturers which had made the wagons. Like the lunch wagon, a stationary diner allowed one to set up a food service business quickly using pre-assembled constructs and equipment.

The Transfer Station neighborhood of Union City, New Jersey was the site, in 1912, of the first lunch wagon built by Jerry and Daniel O&#x27;Mahoney and John Hanf, which was bought for $800 and operated by restaurant entrepreneur Michael Griffin, who chose the location for its copious foot traffic. The wagon helped spark New Jersey&#x27;s golden age of diner manufacturing, which in turn made the state the diner capital of the world. In the decades that followed, nearly all major US diner manufacturers, including Jerry O&#x27;Mahoney Inc., started in New Jersey. Jerry O&#x27;Mahony (1890–1969), who hailed from Bayonne, New Jersey, is credited by some to have made the first such &quot;diner&quot;. The O&#x27;Mahony Diner Company of Elizabeth, New Jersey, produced 2,000 diners from 1917 to 1952. Only approximately twenty remain throughout the United States and abroad. Others more credibly credit Philip H. Duprey and Grenville Stoddard, who established the Worcester Lunch Car and Carriage Manufacturing Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1906, when O&#x27;Mahony was still just 16.

Until the Great Depression, most diner manufacturers and their customers were located in the Northeast. Diner manufacturing suffered with other industries during the Depression, though not as much as many industries, and the diner offered a less expensive way of getting into the restaurant business as well as less expensive food than more formal establishments. After World War II, as the economy returned to civilian production and the suburbs boomed, diners were an attractive small business opportunity. During this period, diners spread beyond their original urban and small town market to highway strips in the suburbs, even reaching the Midwest, with manufacturers such as Valentine. After the Interstate Highway System was implemented in the US in the 1960s, diners saw a boom in business as mobile travelers would stop for a meal.

In many areas, diners were superseded in the 1970s by fast food restaurants, but in parts of New Jersey, New York, the New England states, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, the independently owned diner remains relatively common. Since the 1970s, most newly constructed diners lack the original narrow, stainless steel, streamlined appearance, and are usually much bigger buildings, though some are still made of several prefabricated modules, assembled on site, and manufactured by the old line diner builders. A wide variety of architectural styles were now used for these later diners, including Cape Cod and Colonial styles. The old-style single module diners featuring a long counter and a few small booths sometimes now grew additional dining rooms, lavish wallpaper, fountains, crystal chandeliers and Greek statuary. The definition of the term &quot;diner&quot; began to blur as older, prefabricated diners received more conventional frame additions, sometimes leaving the original structure nearly unrecognizable as it was surrounded by new construction or a renovated facade. Businesses that called themselves diners but which were built onsite and not prefabricated began to appear. These larger establishments were sometimes known as diner-restaurants.

* Jerry O&#x27;Mahony Diner Company
* Kullman Dining Car Company
* Mountain View Diners Company
* Silk City Diners
* Tierney Dining Cars
* Worcester Lunch Car Company
* Sterling Streamliner Diners
Inspired by the streamlined trains, and especially the Burlington Zephyr, Roland Stickney designed a diner in the shape of a streamlined train called the Sterling Streamliner in 1939. Built by the J. B. Judkins coach company, which had built custom car bodies, the Sterling and other diner production ceased in 1942 at the beginning of American involvement in World War II. Two Sterling Streamliners remain in operation: the Salem Diner at its original location in Salem, Massachusetts and the Modern Diner in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

==Architecture==
Like a mobile home, the original style diner is narrow and elongated and allows roadway or railway transportation to the restaurant&#x27;s site. In the traditional diner floorplan, a service counter dominates the interior, with a preparation area against the back wall and floor-mounted stools for the customers in front. Larger models may have a row of booths against the front wall and at the ends. The decor varied over time. Diners of the 1920s–1940s feature Art Deco or Streamline Moderne elements or copy the appearance of rail dining cars (though very few are, in fact, refurbished rail cars). They featured porcelain enamel exteriors, some with the name written on the front, others with bands of enamel, others in flutes. Many had a &quot;barrel vault&quot; roofline. Tile floors were common. Diners of the 1950s tended to use stainless steel panels, porcelain enamel, glass blocks, terrazzo floors, Formica, and neon sign trim. Diners built in the 2000s generally have a different type of architecture; they are laid out more like restaurants, retaining some aspects of traditional diner architecture (stainless steel and Art Deco elements, usually) while discarding others (the small size, and emphasis on the counter).

==Cuisine==


Many diners serve casual inexpensive food, such as hamburgers, french fries, club sandwiches, and other simple fare, with menus resembling those from greasy spoon-style restaurants. Much of the food is grilled, as early diners were based around a grill. There is often an emphasis on breakfast foods such as eggs (including omelets), waffles, pancakes, and french toast. Some diners serve these &quot;breakfast foods&quot; throughout the business day and others that focus on breakfast may close in the early afternoon. These are most commonly known as pancake houses. Coffee is ubiquitous at diners. Many diners do not serve alcoholic drinks, although some may serve beer and inexpensive wine, while others—particularly in New Jersey and on Long Island—carry a full drink menu, including mixed drinks. Many diners serve hand-blended milkshakes.

There is regional variation among diners with traditional food. In the US, Michigan and the Ohio Valley at &quot;Coney Island–style&quot; restaurants, coney dogs are served, as are certain types of Greek cuisine like gyros influenced by Greek diner owners. In Indiana and Iowa, pork tenderloin sandwiches are often on the menu. The Northeast has more of a focus on seafood, with fried clams and fried shrimp commonly found in Maine and cheesesteak sandwiches and scrapple in Pennsylvania. Diners in the Southwestern US may serve tamales. In the Southern US, typical breakfast dishes include grits, biscuits and gravy, and soul food such as fried chicken and collard greens. In New Jersey, the &quot;Taylor Ham, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich&quot; is a feature of many diners. Many diners have transparent display cases in or behind the counter for the desserts. It is common with new diners to have the desserts displayed in rotating pie cases. Typical desserts include a variety of pies and cheesecake.

===Immigrant influences===
Several international ethnic influences have been introduced into the diner industry in the US, because of generations of immigration. Many diners in the United States—especially in the Northeast—are owned or operated by first- and second-generation Americans. Greek Americans, as well as Polish, Ukrainian, Eastern European Jews, Italian Americans, Mexicans and Cubans, have notable presences depending on the area. These influences can be seen in certain frequent additions to diner menus, such as Greek moussaka and Pastitsio, Slavic blintzes, and Jewish chicken soup with matzah balls, deli-style sandwiches (e.g., corned beef, pastrami, Reubens), and bagels and lox.

==Cultural significance==
Diners attract a wide spectrum of the local populations, and are generally small businesses. From the mid-twentieth century onwards, they have been seen as quintessentially American, reflecting the perceived cultural diversity and egalitarian nature of the country at large. Throughout much of the 20th century, diners, mostly in the Northeast, were often owned and operated by Greek-American immigrant families. The presence of Greek casual food, like gyros and souvlaki, on several northeastern diners&#x27; menus, testifies to this cultural link.

Diners frequently stay open 24 hours a day, especially in cities, and were once the most widespread 24-hour public establishments in the US, making them an essential part of urban culture, alongside bars and nightclubs; these two segments of nighttime urban culture often find themselves intertwined, as many diners get a good deal of late-night business from persons departing drinking establishments. Many diners were also historically placed near factories which operated 24 hours a day, with night shift workers providing a key part of the customer base. For this reason, diners sometimes served as symbols of loneliness and isolation. Edward Hopper&#x27;s iconic 1942 painting &quot;Nighthawks&quot; depicts a diner and its occupants, late at night. The diner in the painting is based on a real location in Greenwich Village, but was chosen in part because diners were anonymous slices of Americana, meaning that the scene could have been taken from any city in the country-and also because a diner was a place to which isolated individuals, awake long after bedtime, would naturally be drawn. The spread of the diner meant that by 1942 it was possible for Hopper to cast this institution in a role for which, fifteen years earlier, he had used an Automat all-night restaurant. The diner as an institution in this painting is a vignette mimicked by a movie lead-in aired nightly on the Turner Classic Movie Channel.

But as a rule, diners were always symbols of American optimism. Norman Rockwell made his 1958 painting, &quot;The Runaway&quot;, generically American by placing his subjects, a young boy and a protective highway patrolman, at the counter of an anonymous diner. In television and cinema (e.g. &quot;The Blob&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Diner&quot;), diners and soda fountains have come to symbolize the period of prosperity and optimism in America in the 1950s. They are shown as the place where teenagers meet after school and as an essential part of a date. The television show &quot;Alice&quot; used a diner as the setting for the program, and one is often a regular feature in sitcoms such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. The diner&#x27;s cultural influence continues today. Many non-prefab restaurants (including franchises like Denny&#x27;s) have copied the look of 1950s diners for nostalgic appeal, while Waffle House uses an interior layout derived from the diner.

Manhattan was once known for its diners. The Moondance Diner was shipped to Wyoming to make room for development. Diners provide a nationwide, recognizable, fairly uniform place to eat and assemble, desirable traits mirrored by fast food chains. The types of food served are likely to be consistent, especially within a region (exceptions being districts with large immigrant populations, in which diners and coffee shops will often cater their menus to those local cuisines), as are the prices charged. At the same time, diners have much more individuality than fast food chains; the structures, menus, and even owners and staff, while having a certain degree of similarity to each other, vary much more widely than the more rigidly standardized chain and franchise restaurants. The Poirier&#x27;s Diner and Munson Diner, both manufactured by the Kullman Dining Car Company of Lebanon, New Jersey, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Diners have figured significantly in American films and television since the form developed. In &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, the episode titled &quot;The Diner&quot; shows the perils, pitfalls, and difficulty in operating a diner, to much comedic effect. Archetypal appearances include significant scenes in classic films such as &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;The Killers&quot;. The 1982 &quot;rites of passage&quot; film &quot;Diner&quot; was centered on an eatery shared by the protagonists. &quot;Waitress&quot; in 2007 was about a waitress in a diner. Television series include the Food Network show &quot;Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives&quot;. &quot;Pennsylvania Diners and Other Roadside Restaurants&quot;, is a 1993 documentary. Diners are the focus of photorealist painter John Baeder who spent about 40 years painting diners across the US. In 1990, Williams Electronics Games introduced a pinball machine entitled &quot;Diner&quot;. The object of the game is to serve all customers to light-up Dine Time (the jackpot).
